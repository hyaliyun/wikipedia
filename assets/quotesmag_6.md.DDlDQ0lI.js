Wayne Smith of Decatur, Georgia, a missionary to Brazil, was the creator of Friendship Force International. Indonesian guests meet their hosts in Hartwell, Georgia Friendship Force International (FFI) is a nonprofit organization with the mission of improving intercultural relations, cultural diplomacy, friendship, and intercultural competence via homestays. The organization operates in more than 60 countries and in 6 continents, with 15,000 active members and over 300 annual programs, called \\"Journeys\\". The organization holds continuing fundraising campaigns and has a goal of increasing membership from 15,000 to 25,000 people. History The program got its foundation in a project established by Presbyterian minister Wayne Smith and then-governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter in 1973, after organizing an exchange program with Pernambuco, Brazil in which the Brazilians stayed in the Georgia Governor's Mansion. FFI was unveiled on March 1, 1977, by President Jimmy Carter and Smith at a White House gathering of state governors. First Lady Rosalynn Carter served as Honorary Chairperson until 2002. On July 4, 1977, the first exchange took place; it involved 762 members that traveled between Atlanta and Newcastle Upon Tyne. For the first five years, FFI used air charters to shuttle delegations of 150 to 400 visitors between partner cities. In 1982, the format was changed from large simultaneous homestays to smaller non-simultaneous visits using commercial airlines. In the 1980s, Ry≈çichi Sasakawa donated money to the organization that allowed the program to grow internationally. In 1985, FFI instituted the American Russian Mutual Survival program to encourage \\"the use of arms that embrace rather than arms that destroy\\" and facilitated exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1992, FFI was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for its work building understanding between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In June 2012, on its 35th anniversary, FFI launched a program to Cuba. In July 2013, Joy DiBenedetto was named President and chief executive officer of FFI. Effective November 9, 2015, Jeremi Snook became the 6th President and chief executive officer of the organization. In November 2017, FFI announced a partnership with Global Green USA to promote environmental sustainability, peace, understanding, and friendship.

His work has been published in books and is held in public collections. He was a member of the In-Public street photography collective. Biography Agou was born in Montbrison, France in 1969. A self-taught photographer, Agou grew up in a small town in the Forez region, on the eastern side of the Massif Central.Exhibition notice , Clermont-Ferrand city website. From the early 1990s, Agou made documentary-style photographs in both black and white and color which take an allusive approach to the human condition. He also made short films and sculpture. In 1992, he moved to New York City. He began taking photographs in the streets that evoked a sense of longing and isolation. He made photographs at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001, which were used in numerous publications. He first came to prominence with photographs taken in the New York City Subway, published in his book Life Below (2004). In 2002 Agou returned to Forez. He traveled to the lesser-known parts of the region and got to know a community of family farmers whose identities are deeply rooted to the land. He photographed and filmed them at work and at home for eight years. This resulted in Face au Silence / In the Face of Silence, a documentary about rural life in early twenty-first century France. The work won him the 2010 European Publishers Award for Photography, and publication in six editions and in six languages. He became a member of the In-Public street photography collective in 2005.

It is closely related to Pollicipes polymerus, a species with the same common names, but found on the Pacific coast of North America, and to Pollicipes elegans a species from the coast of Chile. It is found on rocky shores in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and is prized as a delicacy, especially in the Iberian Peninsula. Distribution Pollicipes pollicipes is chiefly distributed from 48¬∞N to 28¬∞N, along the coasts of France, Spain (including the Canary Islands), Portugal, Morocco, and south to Senegal. A further population disjunctly located around the tropical Cape Verde Islands at about 16¬∞N has been recently described as a new species, Pollicipes caboverdensis. The periphery of the species' range also extends as far north as the British Isles, with outlying populations on the south coast of England and possibly in southwestern Ireland, although there are no recent records there. The species is present, but rare, in the Mediterranean Sea. It is possible that the outlying populations are not self-sustaining, being instead maintained by immigration of larvae from self-sustaining core populations. In December 2016, a driftwood covered with gooseneck barnacles appeared in a beach in New Zealand, prompting a discussion on what it might be. They or a similar species is served in the coast of Ecuador in the province of Manabi, where they have them as a typical dish in very specific restaurants in Puerto Lopez or Salango. Ecology Pollicipes pollicipes grows in groups on rocks, as well as on the hulls of shipwrecks and on driftwood. It is a filter feeder, living on particles that it can glean from the water passing over its extended cirri; these possess a complex assortment of setae, enabling P. pollicipes to have a varied diet, including diatoms, detritus, large crustaceans, copepods, shrimp and molluscs. The larvae pass through seven free-swimming stages (six nauplii and one cypris) over the course of at least a month. After this time, they settle into the adult, sessile form. P. pollicipes is harvested for consumption in many parts of its range, mostly for the Spanish market, where (marketed as percebe gallego) it may sell for as much as ‚Ç¨90 per kilogram. As a result, the species is thought to be in decline. It is harvested manually, and archaeological evidence suggests that the species has been harvested in this way for over 10,000 years.

The story blends ancient biblical pericopes, the myth of Orpheus, and the fall of rebel angels. Characters * Dr. Raphael Valko: A French professor who coordinates an extraction of a body of a fallen angel from a cave in the Rhodope Mountains in 1943. Seraphina Valko is Dr. Valko's wife.

After she has taken vows, she starts to doubt her religion and starts investigating her parents, who were angelologists. * Percival Grigori: A Nephilim villain. * Verlaine: An art student, who is smitten with Sister Evangeline, and assists her in finding artifacts related to angels and stands beside her in the fight against the Nephilim. * Gabriella L√©vi-Franche Valko: An angelologist, whose activities as a teenage girl directed the course of history.

This model represents the interaction between the managerial culture, the workplace culture and the surrounding culture. Managerial culture is the values of the management, and its norms, practices and artifacts. The workplace culture is the work and behavior norms as perceived by the workers point of view. The surrounding culture stands for the local norms and practices which characterize a national culture/ religious culture etc.Organizational culture, Aviad Raz, The Open University of Israel 2004 The three circles model - Raz 2002 The diagram presents a partial overlapping between the three circles. One must keep in mind, the relations among the circles are dynamic and their borders depend on the situation being studied. The model is not an area model and doesn't intend to describe certain numeric relations. Its objective is to describe the terms in a schematic manner. The first circle describes the managerial culture, which is often perceived as the organizational culture. The common part of circles 1 and 2, designates areas of congruity and acceptance, or \\"devotion\\" in management parlance. The second circle also provides room for \\"countercultures\\" and for workers' subversion of managerial culture. The third circle represents the surrounding local culture, whose values, norms, and socialization can influence both acceptance and resistance to the managerial culture.Emotions at work, Aviad E. Raz , Harvard University Press 2002 The three circles model is connected to some known theories in organizational sociology: *The contingency theory claims that organizations develop in various institutional and cultural environments, and are influenced by them. Therefore, organizations will aspire to maximize the fit to their environment, as a mean to increase efficiency. *The cultural contingency theory (Lincoln & Kallenberg, 1990), expects that over time, the norms and values of the organization will become compatible with the norms and values of the surrounding culture.

She left politics during the transition to multiparty politics in the early 1990s, instead devoting herself to law; she eventually became Vice- President of the Special Criminal Court. In 2007, she received a degree in theology. 2008 local elections and 2009 Senate election In the April 2008 local elections, Rogomb√© was elected as a municipal councillor in Lambar√©n√©; she was subsequently elected as a Senator from Lambar√©n√© in the January 2009 Senate election. Following the latter election, she was elected as President of the Senate on 16 February 2009, receiving the support of 90 of the 99 Senators who voted. Rogomb√©, who was nicknamed the \\"iron lady\\", was a somewhat obscure figure when President Bongo effectively selected her to become President of the Senate, and her selection reportedly surprised many in the PDG leadership. Despite her relative obscurity, she was reportedly familiar with the operation of political power in Gabon, being close to Bongo and a friend of the family of Georges Rawiri, a prominent politician who became President of the Senate before his death in 2006. Presidency As President of the Senate, Rogomb√© was the constitutionally designated successor to the Presidency of the Republic in the event of a vacancy in the latter office; if this occurred, she was to serve only in an interim capacity prior to the holding of a new presidential election, in which she would not be allowed to run. Following the death of President Omar Bongo on 8 June 2009, the Constitutional Court designated Rogomb√© as interim President on 9 June, and her swearing in was scheduled for the following day.\\"Gabon nominates acting president amid mourning for Bongo\\", AFP, 9 June 2009. In her capacity as interim President, the Constitutional Court said that Rogomb√©, unlike an elected President, would not have the power to dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum. A new presidential election was required within 30 to 45 days, according to the Gabonese constitution,\\"Gabon bids to choke fears of Bongo succession battle\\", AFP, 9 June 2009. although it was considered very likely that it would be delayed beyond that point due to the need to update the voter rolls.\\"Gabon's premier sees no election by end July\\", AFP, 23 June 2009. Rogomb√© was sworn in on 10 June 2009, in the presence of members of the Constitutional Court, government, Senate, and National Assembly, as well as foreign diplomats. She took the oath after a minute of silence in Bongo's memory, swearing \\"to devote all my strength to the good of the Gabonese people, with the aim of promoting its well-being and protecting it from all harm, to respect and defend the constitution and a state of law, and conscientiously to carry out my duties and to be fair before everyone\\". Internet access had been cut and television channels played only religious music following the announcement of Bongo's death. After Rogomb√© assumed the Presidency of the Republic, L√©onard Andjemb√©, the First Vice-President of the Senate, succeeded her as President of the Senate in an interim capacity.\\"Gabon: Le S√©nat rend hommage √† Madame le pr√©sident de la R√©publique, Rose Francine Rogomb√©\\", Gabonews, 1 July 2009 . In the presidential election held on 30 August 2009, PDG candidate Ali Bongo was victorious according to official results. Bongo was sworn in as President on 16 October 2009, and Rogomb√© returned to her post in the Senate on 20 October, taking over from Andjemb√©. There was no provision in the constitution specifically enabling her to return to her former post, but it was believed that Rogomb√©'s resumption of duties in the Senate could constitute a precedent in that regard. In recognition of her work in leading Gabon through the early presidential election, Marcel Sandoungou, the oldest Senator, presented her with a medal of honor on the occasion of her return to the Senate. She said that the Senate was ready to work with Bongo as he pursued his planned reforms.

The original lineup formed in 1998 under the name \\"The Accelerators\\", revising the band name later in 2003. According to Ferguson, Last Falling has become more of a reflection of himself, being the youngest of four siblings by eleven years. The first homemade CD of 3 songs entitled 3 Song EP was released in 2003, featuring songs written while under the previous band name. It was self-produced and circulated at local shows for free with a limited number of copies. A year later in 2004 came a 4 song EP entitled And The Tree Was Happy. The album featured hit song \\"Heroine No. 1 \\"and was recorded and produced by Bryan's brother, Daniel Ferguson, in the childhood home at which Ferguson resided. In 2005, Last Falling recorded In Loving Memory at Sound Image in Van Nuys, CA. This proved to be the only album that was recorded in a professional studio next to legendary Sound City Studios, which Dave Grohl helped make a documentary for in 2013. After mild success over the years, the band hit a falling out in 2008 as Ferguson stepped back to focus on his personal life and family. The passing of Ferguson's father in February 2016 - notable \\"Boss Jock\\" and National Radio Hall of Fame personality, Charlie Tuna - sent Ferguson back into the studio to pursue his passion for music once again. The Charlie Tuna Show Ferguson produces and hosts a podcast titled The Charlie Tuna Show, officially launched on March 1st, 2020.

After a life in media and publishing, Charles Wintour went on to become the editor-in- chief of the London Evening Standard. Under his leadership, the Evening Standard was described as a \\"blend of popular and serious news and opinion\\" which prefigured many of the broadsheets of the 21st century.‚Äù\\"Wintour, Charles Vere\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, September 2004. Wintour was educated at the University of Cambridge where he edited Granta magazine. Life and career Wintour was born in Pamphill Manor, near Wimborne, Dorset, the son of Alice Jane Blanche Foster and Major-General Fitzgerald Wintour. He wrote articles for the Radio Times while he was at Oundle School, and won a prize awarded by the Daily Mail. He then went up to university where he studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge, reading English and history and briefly editing the Granta magazine with Eric Hobsbawm.Michael Leapman, \\"Obituary: Charles Wintour\\", The Independent, 5 November 1999. After Cambridge, Wintour took a London job in advertising, but left at the start of World War II to join the Royal Norfolk Regiment. During the war, he was awarded the military MBE, the Croix de Guerre and the Bronze Star. In 1940 Wintour married Eleanor \\"Nonie\\" Trego Baker; the couple later divorced in 1979. In 1946, Wintour became a leader writer for the London Evening Standard. He was soon promoted to political editor, then moved to the Sunday Express as assistant editor. He returned to the Standard as deputy editor, during which period he convinced Lord Beaverbrook to launch the Evening Standard Awards for theatre in 1955.Wintour became managing editor of the Daily Express in 1958, then in 1959 moved back to the Standard as editor.Brian MacArthur, \\"Wintour, Charles Vere\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. During this period, he had five children, of whom two, Anna and Patrick, later became prominent journalists.Peter Preston, \\"Charles Wintour\\", The Guardian, 5 November 1999. Although circulation fell somewhat under Wintour's editorship, he was well regarded, and was considered for the post of editor of The Times in 1967. He was particularly passionate about the paper's politics and high-society gossip column, the Londoner's Diary, once remarking that: \\"To go to a decent London dinner party without having read the Diary would be to go out unprepared for proper conversation.\\" Wintour remained editor until 1976, when he became managing director of the Daily Express, supervising its transition from broadsheet to tabloid. He took part in the negotiations to merge the London Evening Standard with the Evening News, championing the case for keeping the staff and approach of the Standard. As a result, the proposed merger was called off. The Express Group was sold to Trafalgar House, and new owner Victor Matthews appointed Wintour editor of the Standard again in 1978. In 1979, Wintour joined the Press Council, serving for two years. In 1980, the Standard and the News were finally merged. While the name of the Standard was ultimately retained, Wintour and his senior executives were replaced by former News editor Louis Kirby and his respective executives. In 1981, Wintour launched the Sunday Express Magazine with new wife Audrey Slaughter,\\"Slaughter, Over 21 and Cosmopolitan\\". Magforum, 23 October 2013. and in 1984 they launched Working Woman magazine. In 1985, Wintour became editor of the Press Gazette, and he advised on the launch of Today, The Independent and the new Daily News, in addition to the breakfast television show TV-am. He wrote two key books drawn from experience: Pressures on the Press in 1972,Wintour, Charles (1972). Pressures on the Press: An Editor Looks at Fleet Street. Andre Deutsch: London. . a candid account of decision-making during every hour of the newspaper day; and The Rise and Fall of Fleet Street in 1989,Wintour, Charles (1989). The Rise and Fall of Fleet Street. Hutchinson: London. . a shrewd analysis of Fleet Street as a publishing centre through those who were responsible for its historic rise and the more recent responses to new technology. Wintour retired in 1989 and spent his later years supporting the Liberal Democrats and chairing the regional National Art Collections Fund. Wintour‚Äôs impact on London theatre has been acknowledged by both major organisers of annual drama awards. When he retired in 1982 The Society of London Theatre paid tribute by giving him the Society of London Theatre Special Award which would usually go to actors, directors and such. After death, his own Evening Standard Theatre Awards added his name into one category, to create The Charles Wintour Award for Most Promising Playwright. Most significant of all, at his memorial wake, supervised in 1999 by his daughter Anna, the leading playwright Harold Pinter read from his own work and expressed gratitude for his play The Caretaker winning the Best Play award in 1960,\\"Harold Pinter Archive\\".

Parkinson: \\"The Fairy Prince\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed February 17, 2009), (subscription access) History Despite being designated as a masque, the work is sung throughout, and is in many respects reminiscent of a comic opera. It is set by Windsor Castle, and depicts satyrs and fairies who guard the castle and its inhabitants during ceremonial occasions. The masque concludes with a banquet with the King and Queen in attendance. Of particular note is the wood nymphs‚Äô aria \\"Let us play and dance and sing\\", which has a large range of approximately 2 and a half octaves and has some impressive coloratura passages. The Act 1 choral finale, \\"Then all the air shall ring\\", is also particularly fine. The Fairy Prince was very well received at its premiere and was performed 36 times during the 1771-1772 season. While critics and audiences praised both the music and the elaborate sets of the production, the work was strangely never revived. The masque's score was published in 1771 but without the dance music, recitatives, and some of the choruses.

She was the founder of the M√ºttergenesungswerk charitable organisation officially called Elly Heuss-Knapp Foundation in her honour.  Life  Elly Knapp was born in Stra√üburg, then capital of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine, the daughter of the renowned economist Georg Friedrich Knapp (1842‚Äì1926), founder of the chartalist school of monetary theory, who taught at the Stra√üburg University. Her mother Lydia Qorghanashvili (1849‚Äì1925), who was from Georgia, became mentally ill shortly after her birth. Elly, a bright, inquisitive child, and her sister Marianne spent much time with their grandparents and were raised by their father alone, uncommon at the time. She studied to become a teacher, taking the exam in 1899, and worked as a teacher at a girls' school in Stra√üburg from 1900, of which she was one of the co-founders. Concerned with civic education, she early became influenced by the liberal politician Friedrich Naumann and in 1905, she went on to study economics in Freiburg and Berlin, while becoming a frequent public speaker on political issues. In 1908, she married then- journalist Theodor Heuss, an assistant to Friedrich Naumann. The wedding in Stra√üburg was presided over by Albert Schweitzer. Their only son, Ernst Ludwig Heuss, was born in 1910. Due to complications during that birth (which was nearly fatal for Elly), she could not have more children. Back in Berlin after World War I, Elly Heuss-Knapp like her husband had been a candidate for the liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) in the German federal election of 1919, strongly emphasiszing women's suffrage. Over the years Elly became more interested in theological questions and from 1922 became active in the Protestant congregation of Otto Dibelius in Berlin. After the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933, she was forbidden to speak publicly, and her husband was dismissed from his lecturing job at the university. Their home became a meeting place of people opposed to the regime, including the Dahlem pastor Martin Niem√∂ller. Elly Heuss-Knapp became an author and also worked in advertising to support her family, developing an early kind of jingle radio commercial. Her autobiography, Ausblick vom M√ºnsterturm, was published in 1934, and a second edition in 1952. In the final stage of the World War II Heuss-Knapp and her husband lived in Heidelberg. After the war she was elected a member of the Landtag state legislature in W√ºrttemberg-Baden in 1946, as a representative of the liberal Democratic People's Party (DVP) and its Free Democratic Party (FDP) successor. Her work as a politician concentrated on child care and social policy in general, earning her the reputation of an unofficial \\"mother of the state\\". She finished her parliamentary career when her husband was elected President of Germany in 1949. Together with her husband, Elly Heuss-Knapp was one of the co-founders of the European Movement in Germany in June 1949, and was Vice President of the organisation. On 31 January 1950 she publicly announced the foundation of the M√ºttergenesungswerk organisation for maternal health, which remained under the patronage of the wives of the German presidents up to today. It was later named Elly-Heuss- Knapp-Stiftung ‚Äì Deutsches M√ºttergenesungswerk in her honour. Elly Heuss-Knapp died in 1952 at the university clinic in Bonn, and was buried at the Stuttgart Waldfriedhof cemetery.

Moreover, a group of Russian soldiers of fortune also wants to steal the diamonds. Black outsmarts them and retrieves the diamonds during their holdup. Unfortunately his cousin tries to betray him. That is his cousin's downfall. Now all on his own, Black is caught by a feisty female police agent. Soon both are hunted by vengeful former Russian commandos.

History Temple Hall was constructed in 1810 for William Temple Thomson Mason (24 July 1782-1862), a son of Thomson Mason and his second wife Elizabeth Westwood Wallace of nearby Raspberry Plain, and nephew of George Mason. The estate became a hub of Leesburg society and was visited by Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette during his grand tour of the United States on 9 August 1825. Lafayette was accompanied by President John Quincy Adams and former President James Monroe, who was then residing at his Oak Hill plantation in southern Loudoun County. The three gentlemen witnessed the baptism of Mason's two youngest daughters at Temple Hall with Lafayette serving as godfather for Mary Carroll, and Adams and Monroe serving as Maria Louisa's godfathers. Altogether, Mason and his wife, Ann Eliza Carroll, raised ten children at Temple Hall. In addition to the Mason family, approximately twenty enslaved African-Americans resided on the property. Under Mason's management, the Temple Hall estate was a modestly successful farm. Mason cultivated orchards and raised corn, wheat, and livestock. Mason retired to Washington, D.C. in 1857 and sold his farm to Henry A. Ball, who farmed it with using approximately 20 enslaved young men, 17 under age 16.NRIS Section 8 p. 14 Ball favored secession, and after Virginia voted for secession as the American Civil War began, two of Henry Ball's enlisted in the Confederate States Army's cavalry. In 1862, Henry Ball was arrested for refusing to take an oath of allegiance to the Federal Government. Ball was released after spending nearly a year in the Old Capitol Prison. John S. Mosby visited Temple Hall on 5 July 1864 and dined with the Ball family. While at the house, Mosby received information that led to the Action at Mount Zion Church. Temple Hall remained in the Ball family until 1878 when it was sold at auction. In 1940, after a succession of owners, the Temple Hall property was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. James H. Symington. The Symingtons restored the mansion and made extensive renovations. They modernized Temple Hall by adding indoor plumbing and electricity. The Symingtons planted a variety of crops and eventually began specializing in popcorn. They became the largest suppliers in the eastern United States until the popcorn market collapsed after World War II. Afterwards, the Symingtons turned to raising livestock, including cattle and hogs, as well as wheat, corn, and hay for animal feed. Mrs. Symington assumed management of the farm's operations after her husband became ill in the 1970s, and continued to operate it after his death. Concerned about Loudoun County's rapid development and population growth, Mrs. Symington donated the 286 acre farm to the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA) in 1985. Since then, the NVRPA has operated Temple Hall as a working farm and interpretive center. Temple Hall, along with several neighboring estates including nearby Mason family estate Raspberry Plain, is a contributing property in the Catoctin Rural Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 31 January 1989. Temple Hall was listed on the National Register on 13 February 2007. Architecture Temple Hall is an early 19th- century Federal-style mansion.

It lies in the Snowdonia National Park to the north of Dolgellau. A470 passes through it. The Community population taken at the 2011 Census was 179. Geography The village, which lies where the old Roman road used to ford the River Eden just before it joins with the rivers Mawddach and River Gamlan has 3 large waterfalls and many smaller ones all within Coed y Brenin (the forest of the king). Features The village includes Dolmelynllyn Hall (now a Hotel and owned by the National Trust), and the area is also referred to as Dolmelynllyn. One author suggests an Arthurian link to the village but there is no other corroboration. The village is now surrounded by Forestry Commission and National Trust parkland of conifers and oaks. A large area of surrounding ancient oak woodland is a designated SSSI and has a particularly rich temperate maritime Bryophyte community. The forest has a group of Wellingtonia planted in the early 20th century and Dolmelynllyn has two trees dating from the 1850s in the meadow, one being the second largest in Wales . The forests are full of wildlife, with deer, red squirrels, pine martens, polecats, otters, and other mammals, and a variety of birds from black grouse to merlins, buzzards, and red kites. There are many walks from the village into the forest, and several free car parks. Governance Ganllwyd has a community council, responsible for maintenance of local footpaths, footbridges and, until 2017, public toilets. At 179, the community council has the smallest population of any council in Wales.

It is part of the Bergamo Alps, and it has two peaks, Grignone or Grigna settentrionale, the higher, and the lower Grignetta or Grigna meridionale (2,177 m).  Geography and climbing routes  To the southwest, the Grigna massif descends precipitously toward an arm of Lake Como known as 'Ramo di Lecco' (The Branch of Lecco). To the east, the mountain rises gently through fields and forested land into Valsassina. The northern side of the mountain, which is known for its many caves and crevices, leads to Passo del Cainallo and the town of Esino Lario. The easiest route to the Grignone peak is from the southeast starting at the town of Ballabio in Valsassina. Farther up the valley is Pasturo, another traditional trailhead for the ascent. The mountain's relative isolation affords it panoramic views of Alps toward the north and on clear days, the Milan cathedral can be seen to the southwest. The Rifugio Brioschi (a mountain hut with food and accommodations) sits on the Grignone peak and is open most of the year. There are other shelters lower down on the massif, including Rifugio Bietti, Rifugio Arnaldo Bogani, Rifugio Pialeral, and Rifugio Rosalba. Every year in September, Grigna hosts a Skyrunning event known as the \\"Trofeo Scaccabarozzi\\", which starts and finishes in Pasturo. The route passes over Grigna Meridionale and Grigna Settrionale and covers a distance of 43 km.

The purpose of the committee was to study and make recommendations on the role, scope, operation, and impact of military, economic, technical and other foreign assistance programs in relation to the foreign policy and national interest of the United States. It reported to the president on March 1, 1957, and ceased operations by the close of that month.  Activity  The committee received testimony and reports on foreign aid programs from major military and foreign policy figures. The committee also made a six-week round-the-world trip during which members interviewed leading military and political figures in European and Asian nations receiving American aid. Committee members also received briefings from American military assistance advisory teams and embassy staffs during the trip. While the committee received an appreciable amount of input on military aid, its major recommendations were in the field of economic assistance and administrative changes in the foreign aid program. It recommended gradual reciprocal tariff reduction to the end of achieving minimal foreign quantitative restrictions on American trade. Also recommended were support of regional organizations like the European Common Market; tax incentives for American private investment abroad; continued government loans to supplement efforts of the Export-Import Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; and continuation of the agricultural surplus sales program (PL 480). In the administrative field, the committee recommended separation of military and economic appropriations, integration of the International Cooperation Administration into the U.S. State Department, two-year appropriations for foreign aid, and greater discretionary authority for the executive branch in spending foreign assistance funds.

The agency runs several programs: Early Learning, Counseling Services, Developmental Therapies, and Wraparound Support. Childhaven provides support through a Healing Centered Framework that embeds relational health, trauma-informed care, and social justice in all places in which children and families live, learn and play. The agency encompasses three branches: the Broadway Branch in First Hill, the Eli Creekmore Memorial Branch in Burien, and the Patrick L. Gogerty Branch in Auburn. In addition to other in-state organizations, agencies in South Carolina and Calgary have imitated Childhaven's model.\\"History of Childhaven\\" (Childhaven Web site); retrieved on 17 February 2009.  History  Childhaven was founded in 1909 by the Reverend Mark A. Matthews. Its original name was Seattle Day Nursery, and at the time it was one of only 50 child-care centers in the U.S. The agency's original nursery building was constructed in 1921 in Seattle's First Hill neighborhood; today, the site is home to Childhaven's Broadway Center, which was completed in 2004 thanks to the Capital Campaign, which raised $15.5 million. In 1965 Childhaven was the first organization to bring Head Start to the west coast, providing a year round preschool program to help prepare young children for school. Seattle Day Nursery's name and purpose transformed following a shift in leadership that started in 1973. That year, Patrick Gogerty became the organization's executive director, and he soon changed its focus, establishing the Therapeutic Child Care Program in 1977 with 10 children. \\"Through the last 100 years, this agency has constantly adapted to meet the needs of the community.\\" Pat Gogerty. This occurred two years before Washington state made the reporting of child abuse mandatory. Under Gogerty's guidance, the agency began to garner national acclaim; in 1984, it was the subject of a major article in Life magazine.\\"Gogerty, Patrick\\" (HistoryLink.org); retrieved on 18 February 2009. The following year, Seattle Day Nursery was formally renamed Childhaven. That same year, Congress threatened to cut off Childhaven's funding. Gogerty enlisted the help of his friend Rep. Jim McDermott, who brought the Life article to a House session and told the story of a specific child the agency had rescued. Persuaded, Congress continued to provide funding for Childhaven's work. Before Gogerty retired in March 1998, The Seattle Times published an editorial lauding his achievements; its headline was \\"Fighting for Kids Unable to Fight for Themselves.\\" In 2009 Childhaven recently celebrated its centennial, and a number of events were planned, including a large-scale luncheon and several open houses.Childhaven Web site (home page); retrieved on 18 February 2009.

It is wide and of a depth that allows the navigation of small boats. The river crosses flat and fertile fields. This valley of the Repocura River was the location of the densely populated Rupucura rehue and was the location of the principal placer gold mines of the old city of La Imperial before the Mapuche Uprising of 1598. Rupucura also was the name of one of the aillarehue of the Lafkenmapu Butalmapu. Rupucura was located on both shores of the Cholchol River, from entrance of the Colpi River, to the Caut√≠n River, and from the Cautin, from hills of Nielol to the Nahuelbuta Range. By the bank of the Repocura river Fort de la Encarnaci√≥n was built in 1666 by the Royal Governor of Chile Francisco de Meneses Brito. A fort and a mission with the title of Repocura or Repucura were founded in December 1694, replacing to the Fort de la Encarnaci√≥n destroyed during a Mapuche rising earlier that year.

In the book, Hall argued that inequalities in wealth and the production of luxuries led to the exploitation of the poor, and their suffering. Hall famously claimed that the exploitation of the poor was so severe that they \\"retained only the product of one hour's work out of eight\\". As a remedy for the problems in society, Hall proposed land reform and progressive taxation. His views and economic theory, particularly his views on severe exploitation of the poor, were important to the development of Marxism, and have led many to consider him one of the earliest socialists. Biography Hall was born in England around 1740, and studied medicine at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. After completing his medical studies, Hall practised in the West Country of England, where he acquired \\"intimate knowledge of the living conditions of the poor\\". Hall read the theories of a number of influential classical economists, including Malthus, David Ricardo and Adam Smith. While he disagreed with many of the ideas of classical economics, it shaped his thinking. Hall's thinking was also shaped by his friendship with the land- socialization advocate Thomas Spence, with whom he corresponded regularly. Hall moved around throughout his career, but probably spent most of his life in Tavistock, Devon, practising medicine. In 1785, he published The Family Medical Instructor, a medical reference book. Thereafter, his publications were primarily economic in nature. In 1805, he published his principal work, The Effects of Civilization, followed by Observations on the Principal Conclusion in Mr. Malthus's Essay on Population in 1813. In 1816, Hall was arrested for failure to pay a debt of ¬£157, and he spent the next nine years in the Fleet Prison, before being released on 21 June 1825. While the exact date of his death is uncertain, it is believed that he died shortly thereafter. The Effects of Civilization After witnessing high food prices and food shortages in England from 1795 to 1801, Hall began to write The Effects of Civilization on the People in European States, which set forth his economic theories. Hall argued that the root cause of food shortage, was that too few people worked in agriculture, and too many were employed in trade and manufacturing. From that argument, Hall proceeded to his definition of wealth, arguing that \\"wealth consists not in things but in power over the labour of others\\". The cause of shortages From his definition of wealth, Hall argued that the problem in civilised societies came from the ability of the wealthy, through their control of the labour of others, to determine what is produced. Because the wealthy quickly provide for their own necessities, they spend their surplus on luxuries, which \\"make it possible for a rich man to consume and destroy infinitely more of the produce of other men's labours than he would be able to do if only foodstuffs and basic necessities were available\\". Because the rich exploit the poor to produce their luxuries, Hall argued that \\"the wealth of the rich and the misery of the poor increase in strict proportion\\". Thus, the rising power of the rich is the cause of the suffering of the poor. Statistics In addition to developing a theoretical model in The Effects of Civilization, Hall attempted to use scientific methods and government statistics to provide evidence for his view. According to his estimates, the top 20% of society, the rich, consumed seven eighths of what was produced by the poor, leaving the poor with only one eighth of what they had produced. Later scholars, however, have calculated that the inequalities described by Hall were not quite so severe. Remedies After describing the challenges facing society, Hall proposed several remedies. Hall was a strong proponent of progressive taxation to even out the inequalities of society and also argued that if marriages between two people who owned land were prohibited, wealth would gradually spread more evenly throughout society. Most importantly, on the basis of his argument that luxuries caused the suffering of the poor, Hall argued that luxury goods \\"should be prohibited, or subject to punitive taxation\\". Hall believed that his remedies were \\"readily practicable\\" and would improve the station of the poor but that they were unlikely to solve the problems of society completely. Legacy Hall is widely regarded as a key to the development of Marxist thought, and Karl Marx referred to him as \\"a true phenomenon in the history of economic thought\\". Hall was also an important precursor to Henry George and one of the first modern land reformers. Many scholars also identify Hall as one of \\"first of the early socialists\\" and one of the first thinkers to recognise the importance of surplus value and rents to societal inequality.

The mostly 12th- and 13th-century building, in an isolated setting facing the South Downs, has been designated a Grade I Listed building. History The small village of Pyecombe is situated in a long, deep valley (or coombe) formed by the river Wellesbourne as it flows towards the English Channel at Brighton. (The river is now a winterbourne and runs underground for most of its length.) The South Downs rise to about to the east and west. The village is in two parts about apart. The original medieval settlement formed around the church and an ancient trackway across the South Downs; when this declined, new development took place to the west. A 16th-century cottage which may have been part of the manor house is in this newer area. Pyecombe manor was probably split from the larger manor of Pangdean (mentioned in the Domesday Book) by the 13th century, although they were later reunited. The church was built on the west side of the trackway, which was at the centre of three ancient routes across the South Downs which split at the south end of the village. The western route became the main London Road, now the A23; the eastern route forms the A273 to Clayton, Hassocks, Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath. The church existed, under the name of Pangdean (or Pingeden) Church, at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, when the St Pancras Priory at Lewes held the advowson. In 1537, during the Reformation, it passed to King Henry VIII. The oldest parts of the present structure, the chancel, chancel arch and nave, are 12th-century; a date of 1170 has been attributed. The Norman tower at the west end was built in the 13th century and holds one 15th-century bell. A roughcast finish was applied to the whole exterior in 1898, but this has now been removed except on the outside of a blocked doorway on the south side. As well as this restoration, some work was carried out on the church in 1844 and 1914. Architecture The east window The church is aligned from east to west with its chancel and altar at the east end. It consists of a 12th-century chancel and plain, semicircular chancel arch; a nave of the same age, with two rectangular windows on each side; and a short tower from the 13th century, with two angled buttresses at the southwestern and northwestern corners. The former has a 13th-century gravestone incorporated into the stonework, but the buttresses are no earlier than 14th-century. On the north side is an entrance porch and a vestry. Horsham stone tiles are used for the church and porch roofs and the shallow \\"Sussex cap\\"-style roof of the tower. In common with many Sussex churches, flint was used as the main building material. This was hidden under the roughcasting for about a century, but has now been revealed again. There are modern stone dressings around the windows. Some of the windows themselves are also 19th-century copies, although those in the nave are from the 15th century. Inside, the chancel arch has a smaller modern arch on each side. The tiled floor of the sanctuary dates from the 13th century; the encaustic tiles were made at St Pancras Priory, and retain designs showing animals and birds. The carved pulpit is dated 1636, although it was remodelled in 1898. The lectern has similar carvings. One surviving 12th-century internal fixture is the font, made of one strip of lead bent into a drum shape and sealed at the join. The exterior has ornate scrollwork designs. Tapsel gate The Tapsel gate There is a rare design of gate on the north side of the churchyard. Unique to Sussex, and named after the Sussex family who were responsible for its invention, the Tapsel gate is one of only six remaining in the county, although others may have existed in the past. All are found within of Lewes. The Tapsel gate at Pyecombe is an early 20th-century replacement: the original was put in place in the 18th century. It incorporates the hooked end of a Pyecombe crook‚Äîa type of shepherd's staff made in the village since the 18th century. Tapsel gates are mounted on a central pivot. Even when fully open, they are too narrow to allow cattle to enter churchyards, but they are easier for pallbearers to negotiate than a normal side-hinged gate: they can pass on each side and the coffin can be rested on the central pivot if necessary. The church today The church from the northeast, showing the vestry and porch The Church of the Transfiguration is part of the Benefice of Poynings with Edburton, Newtimber and Pyecombe. This covers five downland villages, each with one church: the others are St Andrew's Church at Edburton, Holy Trinity Church at Poynings and St John the Evangelist's Church in Newtimber. The former church of the Good Shepherd at Fulking is no longer in use but is nominally part of the Benefice. The parish itself covers Pyecombe village and the surrounding farms and downland, as far south as the Brighton and Hove boundary and north to Clayton. The church was Grade I listed on 28 October 1957. The local District Council designated the area around the church a conservation area in January 1989. Two services take place each month, and Pyecombe Parish Council holds its meetings in the church.

She is one of several artists who gained notice at a moment when much attention was being paid to the graduates of Los Angeles-area MFA programs. Life and work Brown graduated from University of California, Los Angeles in 2000. Best known for painted scenes that include her friends cavorting in places of specific privilege (such as art collectors' homes), Brown gained notoriety in October 2000 when The New York Times Magazine ran an eight-page spread of her watercolors posing as fashion editorial. This publication coincided with her debut exhibition at D'Amelio Terras gallery in Chelsea, titled What! Are You Jealous? (featuring scenes of women drinking champagne poolside in Beverly Hills-ish backyards, with the title borrowed from a Gauguin painting of Tahitian women lounging likewise), which was attacked by Times critic Michael Kimmelman who called the buzz around her work a \\"pseudo-event\\".Kimmelman, Michael (October 27, 2000). \\"Art In Review; Delia Brown\\". New York Times. Brown's work is primarily engaged in exploring desire as an individuated experience that connects the personal to the collective unconscious, often mediated through advertising and commercial culture. Referencing early bourgeois painting genres, she paints herself and friends enacting their own fantasies of being part of the leisure class, with props from snacks and beverages to million-dollar artworks functioning as important accessories in the assumption of privilege. In interviews, Brown has often referenced her upbringing in a left-wing activist family as influential in her choice of subject matter. She has expressed discomfort about the role of the painter/artist as serving as high-status entertainment and decor for the patron class, and much of her work seems to contain a subtle grain of hostility, implying the discomfort she feels in her own complicity in this economic arrangement. Brown's background includes several years pursuing a career as a hiphop lyricist in a two-girl group called The Fuzz (with Evelyn Charlot, a.k.a. Evenflo), as well as studies in the Stanislavsky Method of acting. These experiences inform Brown's practice in various ways including her use of role-playing and dress-up for her paintings, and occasional forays into performance and video. Brown has worked with actress Hollis Witherspoon in developing a fictional artist character called Chelsey Green, whose paintings and performances Brown devises and then hands off to Witherspoon the job of playing \\"author\\" to the projects. To date, Witherspoon-as-Green has been seen in a painting and video exhibition at the Margo Leavin Gallery in Los Angeles (2006) titled Step-and-Repeats and Double Self-Portraits.\\"Delia Brown: Double Self-Portraits and Step & Repeat \\". Artnet.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-17. Witherspoon also plays a character in Brown's on-going project titled Felicity and Caprice, a narrative series of paintings and drawings which draw upon Claude Chabrol's camp masterpiece of 1960s French cinema, Les Biches. A series of drawings on this theme was exhibited at D'Amelio Terras in 2007 and received praise from critics. Writing in The New York Times, Martha Schwendener says \\"Ms. Brown has taken hold of a cache of references, from commercial illustration to French erotic cinema, and spun it into a deadpan, streamlined narrative about women, friendship and patronage\\".Schwendener, Martha (April 27, 2007). \\"Art in Review; Delia Brown\\". New York Times. Brown is the recipient of the 2019 Richard Diebenkorn Teaching Fellowship at the San Francisco Art Institute. In her recent work, Brown has stopped using photographs as a source material in favor of a heavy stylization influenced by Futurism and Cubism.

The company announced in December 2008 that it had ceased trading.  Offices  Bulgarian Dreams operated from several offices with headquarters at 120 Moorgate, London, UK, EC2M 6SS - now closed  Early success  Bulgarian Dreams sold off plan properties in Bulgaria, marketing the country as an up- and-coming destination with a rapidly developing economy and growing tourist trade. The company was well regarded and won International Residential Property Awards for Real Estate Agency in three consecutive years 2004-2006 including Best Real Estate Agency, Best Property in Bulgaria, Best Property Website and Best Development in Bulgaria from 2004 through to 2006. The company received widespread news coverage.  Ceasing Trading  The London office closed around the end of 2008 but the Sofia office remains open and in contact with clients. The Bulgarian Dreams website was replaced in early 2009 with a statement from the company stating that they had decided to cease trading due to prevailing economic conditions. Customers were instructed to liaise directly with the developers of their properties.  Customer complaints and adverse publicity  Bulgarian Dreams has received negative media coverage, with customer dissatisfaction gaining pace through 2008 and into 2009. Buyers have complained that the properties they have paid for (either in part or in full) were left incomplete, or delayed due to financial problems and/or planning permission issues. The BBC‚Äôs consumer affairs programme Watchdog featured a story on Bulgarian Dreams which aired on 9 February 2009 in the UK. This highlighted the problems experienced by one buyer who purchased an apartment at the Windows To Paradise development on the Black Sea coast being built by the development company Interlink. It was noted that Robert Jenkin had been a director of the company until November 2006. Watchdog broadcast an update to the story the following week, on 16 February 2009. This featured more dissatisfied customers. Bulgarian Dreams declined to be interviewed on air but issued the following statement: Robert Jenkin was interviewed with Chris Dale in Sofia by Watchdog with whom he had been liaising. The interview largely focused on the Windows To Paradise development. This meeting was featured in a Watchdog programme which aired on 18 May 2009 in the UK. At the meeting Robert Jenkin explained that Windows To Paradise had run into difficulties due to a cash-flow problem at the development company, that building costs had been higher than expected and that the global slowdown had hit sales. Additionally a number of purchasers hadn't paid their final payments and that these funds could be used to fund completion of the properties. He said that following these problems he and his customers were now moving forward. \\"Myself and the owners, we're talking about the majority of owners in many developments now, we've put that behind us, we've drawn a line in the sand.\\" When asked about his connections with the development company Interlink, Robert Jenkin stated that he'd once been a manager (until 2006) and that his wife was still a manager, but he explained that these appointments were non-executive and made to allow Bulgarian Dreams to have access to increased information flow on behalf of purchasers. It was reported in the interview that a new structure was being proposed to move the development to completion but that if this failed it was likely that the properties would be auctioned off in relation to an outstanding loan due by the development company.

It was named after a Sussex family of bell-founders, one of whom invented it in the late 18th century. Only six examples survive, all within a radius of Lewes, the county town of Sussex.The historic county of Sussex has been divided into two non-metropolitan counties, East Sussex and West Sussex. Lewes was the county town of historic Sussex and is now the county town of East Sussex. Tapsel gates have the dual advantage of keeping cattle out of churchyards and allowing the efficient passage of coffins carried to and from the church during burials. The name sometimes is used more generally to describe swivelling gates of a similar design elsewhere. Origins The gate at Pyecombe in its closed position The Tapsel family first was recorded in Sussex in 1577, when the churchwardens in the parish of West Tarring paid for some church bells. The surname was recorded as \\"Topsayle\\" and many other variant spellings have been recorded subsequently: Tapsell, Tapsil, Tapsayle, Tapsaille, Topsil and Topsel. As a result, the name of the gate sometimes is spelled differently. Several generations of the family worked as bell-founders and rope-makers from a foundry in Tarring, although they travelled throughout Sussex to undertake repairs and cast new bells. Research suggests the most likely inventor of the Tapsel gate was John Tapsel (or Tapsell), who lived in Mountfield near Battle in the early 18th century, although this is not known for certain. The first record of a Tapsel gate is in the churchwarden's accounts book from St Pancras Church at Kingston near Lewes. An accounting entry in 1729 notes that 1s. 6d. was paid by the church for the installation of a gate in its churchyard. Location of the gates Bishop Lindsay Urwin consecrating the Tapsel gate at Botolphs in 2004. St Andrew's church, Jevington, East Sussex St Mary the Virgin church, Friston, East Sussex Gates of various ages exist at village churches in East and West Sussex. St. Simon and St. Jude Church at East Dean, St. Mary the Virgin Church at neighbouring Friston, and Coombes Church in the hamlet of Coombes retain their original gates, without any restoration. The gate at St. Andrew's Church in Jevington was the only one with an integral stile, but this has been removed and it was restored in 1933. The local parish council has adopted the gate as its logo. The gate at the Church of the Transfiguration in Pyecombe is a replica of its original, and is topped by the curved end of a Pyecombe crook‚Äîa type of shepherd's crook popular among downland shepherds, which was made in a forge opposite the church. St Pancras Church at Kingston near Lewes, has a modern replacement for the old gate which was first set up in 1729. A short distance from Coombes Church, a modern Tapsel gate links the churchyard of St Botolph's Church in Botolphs, West Sussex, with an adjacent council burial ground. Completed and installed late in 2003, it was dedicated by the Area Bishop of Horsham in 2004. No gates of the true Tapsel design have ever been reported outside Sussex, although variations on the concept have been seen occasionally. In 1896, for example, the Sussex Archaeological Society used the name \\"Tapsel gate\\" in its description of a device which opened and closed by means of a wheel, chain, and counterweight. This was at St. Leonard's Church in Heston, Middlesex (now Greater London). The name also is used to describe gates of related, but not identical, design at St Wilfrid's Church in Burnsall, North Yorkshire (this gate is operated by a pulley mechanism), Hayes in West London, and North Cerney in Gloucestershire (these are integrated into lychgates rather than being free-standing). Design Tapsel gate at St Simon and St Jude church, East Dean Tapsel gates are made of wood and are balanced on a solid wooden or metal pivot, instead of being hinged on one side. They can be opened easily, in either direction, with a small push; they therefore are much easier to negotiate than more typical gates. Common problems of side- hinged gates--heaviness and susceptibility to breakage, for example--are avoided. Also, a Tapsel gate can be opened in a smaller area than would be needed for a side-mounted gate. Because the gate is mounted in the centre of the opening in a wall, it effectively halves its width, which prevents passage by large animals, but allows people to pass through on either side easily. This characteristic is especially beneficial in churchyards, enabling pallbearers to carry a coffin through a gate without difficulty.

The 'Strike' referred to a crackdown on the activities of 'counter-revolutionary' elements in China, while the 'Three Antis' were 'graft and embezzlement', 'profiteering' and 'extravagance and waste'. Background The One Strike-Three Anti campaign was launched by the central Communist Party leadership of the PRC in 1970 in an effort to improve China's economic situation and curb the corruption and anarchy in industry. At the end of 1969, production of every major item (with the exception of crude oil) failed to reach its respective target level, and across China production was hindered by continued factionalism and the actions of more radical groupings.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 301 The campaign was an attempt to tackle this worsening situation. Course of the movement In February 1970, the leadership in Beijing announced the start of the One Strike-Three Anti campaign with immediate effect. The order to local authorities in China to 'strike' against 'active counterrevolutionary elements' was issued by Zhou Enlai with Mao Zedong's blessing on 31 January, and the 'Three Antis' ('graft and embezzlement', 'profiteering' and 'extravagance and waste') were unveiled a week later on 5 February. In order for these issues to be effectively tacked, the Beijing leadership called for a national 'tide' of denunciations and the involvement of the 'masses' in the campaign. However, these fairly vague parameters for what constituted 'active counterrevolutionary elements' led to a situation where interpretations and actions against these elements varied considerably in their definition and in their ferocity, tending to err on the harsh rather than the lenient side. For example, in Yinchuan, three university graduates were arrested and executed for supposed 'counterrevolutionary' activity whilst only pretending to study communist theory (such activity included the desecration of a copy of the 'Little Red Book'), and in Hunan province the outspoken wife of Chen Yun was subjected to struggle sessions and solitary confinement for the putting up of two controversial big-character posters.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 303 It was also more generally the case that those condemned in the movement were attacked for financial reasons rather than their political views or actions- for example, in Zhabei in Shanghai, only 6% of all cases in the movement were for political reasons. The crackdowns on unsavoury elements in the cities were periodic and therefore known as 'red typhoons'.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 304 In Shanghai, under the guidance of Wang Hongwen, these 'red typhoons' occurred on average every two months, and involved the mass mobilisation of thousands of police and militia to undertake raids across the city, in the hope of uncovering evidence of 'counterrevolutionary activity'. The ambiguous nature of the wording of the original orders from Zhou Enlai and Mao also meant that in Shanghai (and elsewhere) any small crime could be quickly made into a crime against the 'people'. Denouement The One Strike-Three Anti campaign did not have a definite end, as it came to its conclusion at various times across China. In the capital, the proceedings were largely over by the end of 1970, with the report on the campaign reporting the discovery of 5,757 'counterrevolutionaries', the resolving of 3,138 criminal cases related to major crimes and 'counterrevolutionary' activity and the highlighting of over 6,000 cases of the 'Three Antis'. Elsewhere, however, the campaign continued until as late as 1972 or 1973, with it ending in Shanghai in late 1972. According to the official report, 64,000 people from Shanghai and the surrounding area were 'struggled' against. Officially, the CCP reported that over 280,000 arrests of 'counterrevolutionaries' occurred in the first 10 months of the campaign, up to November 1970.Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, Mao's Last Revolution, Belknap Harvard (2006), p. 306-307 References See also *List of campaigns of the Communist Party of China Category:Cultural Revolution Category:Campaigns of the Communist Party of China Category:History of Shanghai ","title":"One Strike-Three Anti Campaign"},{"id":"21581104","text":"The kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen (), known also by its ordnance inventory designation Sd.Kfz. 265, was the German Army's first purpose-designed armored command vehicle; a type of armoured fighting vehicle designed to provide a tank unit commander with mobility and communications on the battlefield. A development of the Army's first mass-produced tank, the Panzer I Ausf. A, the Sd.Kfz. 265 saw considerable action during the early years of the war, serving in Panzer units through 1942 and with other formations until late in the war. The kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen, is commonly referred to as a command tank, but as it is without a turret or offensive armament and merely is built on the chassis of the Panzer I light tank, it does not retain the capabilities or role of a tank. Instead, it functions more along the line of an armored personnel carrier in conveying the unit commander and his radio operator under armor about the battlefield. History The Sd.Kfz. 265 was designed to fulfill a growing need within the German Army for a command tank, following the realization that the leaders of a massive panzer formation would themselves have to travel in a tank of some type. This vehicle would have to carry extra equipment and personnel to assist the field commander in his duties. The Panzer IA then in service lacked a transmitter, and thus was unsuitable for commanders as they would have to leave the tank and rely on more vulnerable vehicles to carry a transmitter in order to be able to issue orders to their formation. Wishing to retain the Panzer I's armor and mobility, it was decided to modify the Panzer I Ausf. A to do the job. Not entirely satisfactory, significant chassis redesign was required, though this ultimately provided the basis for improvements in the combat tank line as well. Design To increase space for a unit commander, radio operator, and a FuG 6 radio transmitter with associated gear the rotating turret and main armament of the Panzer I combat tank was removed. A tall, fixed superstructure was installed which contained space for the commander and radio operator to work, and a single ball-mounted machine gun was mounted in the front armor of this to give the tank a measure of defensive firepower. Fittings in the vehicle provided for carriage of 900 rounds of ammunition for the machine gun, which was either an MG 34 or older MG 18 in some examples, though in the field it was common for the gun and ammunition storage to be removed to allow for additional internal space. While room existed within this structure for map boards, paperwork and other kit required for operational command and radio operation, the vehicle's interior remained small, a factor leading to its rapid replacement by conversions of larger tanks. Six such conversions were made but meanwhile a new chassis was developed with offered more space for the modifications, and all production vehicles were made on this larger base. In addition to more space, the original tank's 60 hp 4-cylinder air-cooled Krupp M305 engine was replaced by a 100 hp 6-cylinder liquid-cooled Maybach NL38TR to power not only the vehicle, but the newly installed equipment. The new chassis was more satisfactory and would go on to form the basis for the second mass-produced Panzer I, the Ausf. B. Production and operational history In addition to the six Panzer IA-based prototypes, 184 production examples were built by Daimler-Benz from 1935 through 1937, meaning the German Army received just over one kleine Panzerbefehlswagen for every ten Panzer I Ausf. A and B combat tanks built. Between 1935 and 1940 the Sd.Kfz. 265 Panzerbefehlswagen was the standard command tank of the German Panzer divisions. Each Panzer division contained sixteen tank companies, grouped into four battalions, two regiments or one brigade, for a total of twenty-three headquarters. Each headquarters would be issued at least one command tank. In 1940 the Sd.Kfz. 265 was also issued to the signals and observation battalions of the Panzer artillery regiments. The Sd.Kfz. 265 first saw combat in the Polish Campaign of September 1939. Afterwards, many were converted to Sanit√§tskraftwagen I (Sd.Kfz. 265) armoured ambulances which served in the French Campaign of 1940. Of the 190 produced, 96 were still in use in May 1940 at the start of the invasion of France and the Low Countries. Following a 15 mm increase in armor protection (to a total of 28 mm) that was hastily applied to the surfaces of the superstructure as a result of combat experiences in Poland, the Sd.Kfz. 265 command tank continued in use throughout the invasions of France and the Netherlands, and in 1941 many were shipped across the Mediterranean to participate in the North African Campaign. Sd.Kfz. 265 also saw considerable action in the Balkans Campaigns of 1941 before being replaced by larger command vehicles. Though replaced at the company level, many would continue to see service at higher levels of command through 1942. Some were also used as radio control vehicles for Minenr√§um-Wagen BI/BII (Sd.Kfz.300). A small number were also exported to Hungary. A few were still in service with the German Army when the war ended, though largely delegated to training roles.

Personal life and early careers Monson, who is of Icelandic heritage, was raised in Ballard, a Scandinavian ethnic enclave in Seattle. He graduated from Ballard High School. As a student at the University of Washington he was the play-by-play announcer for Husky football on-campus broadcaster KCMU-FM. He began his professional broadcasting career as a producer at KING-TV and sports reporter at KING-AM, then moved to KIRO as part of the Pat Cashman Show. Monson is married with three daughters and lives in Lake Forest Park, Washington. He has variously described himself as \\"right- leaning\\", \\"center right\\", and \\"libertarian\\", and said he voted for Bob Barr in the 2008 presidential election. Current work In 1995 Monson was given his own show on KIRO in the noon to 3:00 pm time slot, replacing Dave Ross who moved to the preceding 9:00 am to noon morning slot. The Dori Monson Show (also referred to as \\"The Big Show\\") is heard from noon to 3:00 pm PST on KIRO-FM and is primarily a politically oriented talk-radio program. As of winter 2008, his show was the highest-rated talk-radio program in the Seattle- Tacoma market. In 2008 Monson was nominated for Radio & Records News/Talk/Sports Local Personality Of The Year, ultimately losing to Bill Handel of KFI-AM (Los Angeles). The dominant political orientation of his program began as roughly middle-of-the-road throughout the 1990s. He often sided with then President Bill Clinton against the conservative Republicans running Congress, particularly during the impeachment hearings following the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He said he voted for Al Gore in the year 2000 presidential election.Seattle Weekly, December 11, 2012 However, his show turned decidedly conservative around the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001, enthusiastically supporting the Iraq invasion and accusing global warming activists of being \\"phony, global warming cultists\\". He also once asked Washington State Democratic Party Chairman Dwight Pelz if he was a communist. Among the regular features on The Dori Monson Show is a weekly \\"one on one against the nuns\\" segment where Monson tests his football acumen against two nuns, Sisters Kath Silverthorn and Cele Gorman of the Archdiocese of Seattle, each making predictions for the next Sunday's NFL games. \\"I wanted to find the absolute most incongruous people we'd normally never associate with football analysis,\\" Monson explained. \\"I thought that would be either Sherpas or nuns and it'd probably be easier to find nuns.\\" Since 2002 Monson has hosted Hawk Talk, a day-of-game broadcast carried on the Seahawks Radio Network, that airs games of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks.

In Massachusetts, he evaded a ban on book salesmen at Harvard University by hiring students as his agents. He was then promoted to sales manager for the encyclopedia. After the war he resumed his old sales vocation by selling back issues of the magazine Current History as bound volumes titled The European War. He moved west for his health, founded a book publishing company in Los Angeles and sold copies of the Mexican Year Book and other titles for Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler. For fifty dollars he purchased an unsuccessful publication called Smiles and persuaded the Commercial Board of Los Angeles to take the magazine as its house organ thereby establishing himself as a publisher. =Newspaper= In 1926, Boddy was hired as editor of the Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News, a failing newspaper originally founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. The following year, with the newspaper bankrupt, he persuaded a stockholder committee and then a federal judge to allow him to take over the newspaper. Within years, it became immensely profitable with Boddy as editor and publisher. Boddy assumed ownership of the newspaper on August 5, 1926. Its plant, at Pico Boulevard and Los Angeles Street, was deeply in debt. He rejected Vanderbilt's editorial philosophy of emphasizing good news by turning the Daily News into a crusading newspaper that addressed police corruption, gambling and prostitution. He quickly earned the enmity of Los Angeles Police Chief James E. Davis, who attempted to silence the News by arresting Boddy. Davis used an obscure municipal law that made it illegal to publish horse-racing entries and results in a general circulation newspaper. The charges never got beyond the arraignment stage, and Boddy continued reporting vice and corruption in his paper. Boddy was a Republican and supported Herbert Hoover in the 1932 Presidential election. He believed the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt was a \\"terrible mistake.\\" Still, he recognized that Roosevelt's New Deal policies had merit and could lift the country out of the Depression. The Daily News was the only Los Angeles newspaper to openly endorse Roosevelt and give him balanced coverage. It also devoted considerable coverage to Technocracy, a type of scientific management of society and the economy. Boddy gave news space to Robert Noble's \\"Ham 'N Eggs\\" plan and Dr. Francis Townsend's \\"Townsend Plan,\\" which proposed that state and federal governments would issue funds to people over age 60. The Daily News also extensively covered Upton Sinclair's run for California governor and his controversial End Poverty in California (EPIC) campaign. Competing newspapers either ignored the campaign or wrote vehement editorials against Sinclair's programs. Just before World War II in October 1941, a disastrous explosion and fire in Fall River, Massachusetts, destroyed a large plant of the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company and with it a large part of government's supply of raw rubber, necessitating scrap drives to collect rubber. Boddy was on the air every night for more than four months, appealing to the public to collect and turn in their old automobile tires and other scrap. In a memo to President Roosevelt, Boddy outlined a plan to get rubber out of Japanese-held Malaya. Three weeks after he had written the memo, Boddy received a letter from the President thanking him for the idea and telling him that the operation was under way. Whether or not the operation actually took place, the story became the basis of the 1950 Hollywood film Malaya, in which the character \\"John Manchester,\\" portrayed by Lionel Barrymore, was based on Boddy. Boddy's editorial policies in these early years established the Daily News as the city's only liberal journalistic voice. After the end of World War II, Boddy's interest in the newspaper began to wane. His efforts to stimulate interest in various plans to boost the country's economy and his crusades for noble causes had ended with the war. Los Angeles had become a mecca for job- seekers and a refuge for new arrivals from the frozen East Coast. Postwar Los Angeles was emerging as an increasingly cosmopolitan city, and many of Boddy's editorial policies seemed quaint to the city's new residents. Rob Leicester Wagner, Red Ink, White Lies:The Rise and Fall of Los Angeles Newspapers, pages 76-77, 86-88, 263-265, 267-269, 272, 276 (Dragonflyer Press, 2000) () Boddy spent less and less time at the newspaper as he focused his energies on his estate, Descanso Gardens, in La Ca√±ada, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. He eventually turned the day-to-day operations over to his general manager, Robert L. Smith. Without Boddy, the newspaper lost its spunk and no longer tilted at windmills, reported newspaper researcher and writer Rob L. Wagner. By the fall of 1953, the Daily News was losing $75,000 a month, and it folded in December 1954. The assets were purchased by the Times Mirror Company. The Los Angeles Mirror, a Times-owned afternoon tabloid newspaper, took the Daily News name to become the Mirror-News. Interests Horticultural In 1936, Boddy purchased a parcel in La Ca√±ada, north of Los Angeles. Boddy had a wide range of interests, including horticulture, ranching, plant science, and politics. In 1942, he bought Mission Nursery of San Gabriel‚Äîand its stock‚Äîfrom the Yoshimura family, who were interned. Boddy named his estate in La Ca√±ada as Rancho de Descanso, which translates as \\"Ranch of Restfulness (or Repose).\\" The estate was deeded to Los Angeles County and is now open to the public as Descanso Gardens. Political For more, see United States Senate election in California, 1950. In 1950, U.S. Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas challenged Democratic Senator Sheridan Downey for the Democratic senatorial nomination from California. When Downey bowed out of the campaign, citing ill health, Boddy entered the race. California's Democratic State Central Committee had tried to draft Boddy to run for office in previous elections in 1942 and 1946. Boddy refused, claiming he had no interest in public office. For the 1950 Senate race, Boddy offered no specific reasons why he was running for office other than to say it was a \\"challenge\\" and he would meet interesting people. Boddy's campaign got off to a late start and, according to Wagner, was disorganized. He received an important endorsement from Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, a Republican, and also got strong support from labor unions. His primary campaign plank was public ownership of hydroelectric plants across the state. He also supported a controversial proposal to limit land ownership in the Central Valley to . His primary weakness was the lack of solid programs to boost California's economy. Los Angeles Times political reporter Kyle Palmer wrote that \\"words flow\\" easily from Boddy, but his late start and lack of political credentials were handicaps to a successful campaign. In May 1950, just weeks before the primary election, Boddy labeled Douglas the \\"Pink Lady\\" by implying that she was aligned with Communists and was part of a group of \\"red hots\\" trying to seize control of Democratic county committees in the state. Boddy and Douglas ran a bitter primary campaign, leaving Douglas, the Democratic victor, badly wounded in her race against the winner of the Republican primary, Congressman Richard Nixon. Boddy came up with the idea of comparing Douglas' voting record to that of leftist Congressman Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party‚Äîa tactic that was seized on by Nixon and his campaign manager, Murray Chotiner in the final election. On June 6, 1950, Douglas beat Boddy at the polls largely on the strength of her popularity with African-American voters. She garnered 889,000 votes to Boddy's 532,000. Nixon, who had crossed-filed in both parties in the primary, won 1,060,000 votes. Douglas lost to Nixon in the November general election See also * Charles E.

On April 7, 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower requested that Congress extend for one year the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, a measure which had originally been passed in 1934. Under this act and its subsequent extensions, the President was authorized to negotiate agreements with other countries for tariff reduction. In his message of April 7, the President called for a commission to study U.S. foreign economic policy in general. Section 301 of this Act provided for a bipartisan commission which consisted of seventeen members: seven appointed by the President, five appointed from the Senate by the Vice President, and five from the United States House of Representatives by the Speaker. President Eisenhower appointed Clarence B. Randall, Chairman of the Board of Inland Steel Company, as Chairman of the Commission. The Commission was directed to examine and report on the subjects of international trade, foreign economic policy, and the trade aspects of national security and total foreign policy. It was to recommend appropriate policies, measures, and practices, based on its findings, in a report to Congress. The Commission held an organizational meeting with President Eisenhower on September 22, 1953 and hearings began October 2, continuing through November 19, including sessions in Paris, France, November 9‚Äì12. Most of the hearings were closed except for public hearings on October 28‚Äì29 when representatives of national associations, trade unions, etc., presented their views on foreign trade. In order to limit the number of witnesses before the Commission, Randall sent out 15,000 letters asking for written statements from individual industries, labor unions, etc. He received of 300 statements in response to these letters. The Commission staff, composed of specialists on various aspects of foreign economic policy, digested the written testimony and information provided by the Department of State, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies, in preparing 800 pages of staff papers upon which the Commission Report was based. This report was divided into twelve sections, such as Dollar Problem, Foreign Aid, Tariff and Trade, East-West Trade, etc. and was presented to Congress on January 23, 1954. This Commission was dissolved on April 23, 1954, three months after it presented its report to Congress.

It was a part of the Korean royal court cuisine and was also patronized by yangban (scholarly-officials).  Names and etymology  The Korean word (, ) is a compound consisting of (, ) meaning \\"dairy\\" and (, ) meaning \\"porridge\\". The word is derived from the Korean transliteration of the Mongolian word () or Old Turkic . Cognates include modern Mongolian () and Kurdish , both meaning \\"cheese\\". As suggested by its etymology, traditional Korean tarak was heavily influenced by the customs of Central Asian‚Äîespecially Mongolian‚Äî fermented milk products. Before the invention of Hangul (Korean alphabet) in the 15th century, the word was transcribed using Hanja (Chinese characters) . The Sino- Korean word () is the Korean reading of the Hanja (\\"congee\\"). Since the archaic word isn't readily understandable to most modern Korean speakers, the compound (, ) with the Sino-Korean word () meaning \\"(cow's) milk\\" is often used along with the old name. (, ) is the Korean reading of the Hanja (\\"cow\\") and (, ) is the Korean reading of the Hanja (\\"milk\\").  History  The history of tarak-juk dates back to the consumption of milk in Korean history. The Kingdom of Goryeo (918‚Äì1392) kept Yuu-so (dairy cow office), and nobles consumed nakso (cheese). However, dairy cattle were rare and usually milk was available only after a cow gave birth. Moreover, the freshness of milk was a vital factor as it could not be delivered over long distances. Therefore, milk was considered a supplementary food for special occasions or a recovery food after illness. During the Joseon era (1392‚Äì1897), the dairy cow office was relocated to a royal court ranch on Mount Naksan east of Seoul. It was renamed Tarak-saek (dairy department). Royal physicians took charge of gathering milk and making tarak-juk to present to the king. From the tenth lunar month to the first month of the next lunar year, they offered tarak-juk to the royal court. The Hall of Senior Officials also offered tarak-juk to elderly officials. Recipes for tarak-juk are recorded in the Joseon books such as Revised and Augmented Farm Management and the Women's Encyclopedia.  Preparation  Pre- soaked glutinous rice is ground by millstone, sieved, and left to settle. The deposits of ground rice, called muri, are boiled, and milk is added slowly on a gentle simmer over a low flame with constant stirring. Salt is then added, to sweeten the porridge, honey can be added. The ratio between milk and muri recorded in the Women's Encyclopedia is 1:0.8, with adjustments allowed according to taste. However, the book advises the amount of muri should not exceed that of milk.

The program seeks to encourage financial institutions to relax identification requirements when opening a bank account to include Mexican CID cards and Guatemalan CID cards as well as other CID cards. California mayors are being enlisted to promote the program which currently includes San Francisco with Fresno, Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose coming soon. The program was first announced by Governor Schwarzenegger and former President Bill Clinton in The Wall Street Journal on January 24, 2008. California was lauded as the first state in the nation to start such an initiative and would be coordinated with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It seeks to draw the \\"unbanked\\" into financial institutions with starter accounts whereby it's hoped that bringing more money into the financial system will grow the economy and help the unbanked build wealth. Criticism Clinton and Schwarzenegger claim that \\"it won't cost taxpayers a dime;\\" however, involving the FDIC and lobbying mayors to rally institutions in their communities translate to utilizing government resources, and someone had to coordinate to get the Bank on California website developed.

In a broadcasting career spanning the 1940s-1990s, he appeared in various roles, becoming a staple on television screens in the Baltimore, Maryland, area. Early years Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 8, 1929, Parker graduated from Baltimore City College in 1946. He began his broadcasting career in the late 1940s on WASA (now WHGM), an AM radio station in Havre de Grace, Maryland, hosting a music program called the Royal Record Review. He moved to television when the medium was in its infancy, joining WAAM-TV (now WJZ-TV) in Baltimore in 1951. Television career Parker served in diverse roles during his more than four decade career in television (1951-1994), including newscasts, sports events, children's programs, announcing duties, and commercials. As a television newscaster with WAAM-TV in Baltimore, Parker covered the 1952 elections, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U. S. President and J. Glenn Beall was elected U.S. Senator from Maryland. He created a children's television character, Mister Poplolly, in which he would don an oversized hat and glasses, along with a clown's nose, for a daily show. Later, he portrayed a Popeye-like sailor hosting a daily cartoon show. Parker also did commercials, including The Buddy Deane Show between 1957-1962 (by then, WAAM had been sold to Westinghouse and its call letters changed to WJZ-TV). In 1962, Parker moved to WBAL-TV, where he hosted such popular televised bowling programs as Pinbusters and Bowling for Dollars in the 1970s. While at WBAL, he played P. W. Doodle, a newsboy character he created based on his own experience selling newspapers in Baltimore as a youth. On November 22, 1963, he was called upon to broadcast the news flash of U.S. President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Later on his career, Parker broadcast the resignation of Richard Nixon, economic disasters facing the United States, the Iran hostage crisis and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. Parker remained at WBAL-TV until his retirement in 1994. Reflecting on his varied roles in the early pioneering years of commercial television, Parker recalled in 2008 that when he started at WAAM in 1951, earning $45 per week, \\"We just figured things out as we went along. In six months, you did everything. I could run a control board, or put on a cooking show\\". Later years and personal life Parker and his wife, Phyllis, had three sons. After leaving broadcasting, he ran for a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1994, but lost in the primary election. He later took a job as an inspector for the Baltimore City Liquor License Board, retiring from that position in 2006.Michael Dresser, Royal Parker Pollikoff, Baltimore TV pioneer, dies, Baltimore Sun (January 9, 2016).

History Background During the 19th Century Germans were the second- largest immigrant group to the United States, behind only the ethnic Irish.Anne Spier, \\"German-Speaking Peoples,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig, The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: Volume 3: Migrants from Southern and Western Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 315. The wave of German immigration began slowly, averaging about 20,000 people per year during the decades of the 1830s and early 1840s, before exploding after the economic crisis of 1847 and the failure of the Revolution of 1848 in the German states. when the first wave of mass emigration peaked, 1854, some 220,000 Germans lifted up stakes in the fatherland for a new home in America. Immigration centered in a number of major American cities of the East and Midwest, including St. Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and New York CitySee the graphic \\"Places of Publication of German-American Labor Periodicals\\" in Spier, \\"German-Speaking Peoples,\\" pg. 319. ‚Äî urban areas which retained this Germanic influence for many decades, or in some cases, for generations. A second mass wave of emigration from Germany to America began in 1866, following the conclusion of the American Civil War and running until the economic collapse associated with the Panic of 1873. During this second flurry of departures more than a million more Germans were added to the population of the United States. Establishment Development Split with the Socialist Labor Party World War I Split with the Socialist Party of America Later years Termination and legacy \\\\---- The New Yorker Volkszeitung began as a daily in 1878. It was edited by Sergei Shevitch from 1879 to 1890. It was later reorganized by Dr. Siegfried Lipschitz, an American correspondent of the Sozialistischer Pressedienst of Berlin, Germany. He succeeded Ludwig Lore as the newspaper's editor. Afterwards the publication was endorsed by the Socialist Party of the United States and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Its publisher was the Socialist Cooperative Publishing Association which had offices at 47 Walker Street in New York City. The financial crisis of the 1930s prevented members of the Socialist Cooperative Publishing Association from meeting regularly, which made it necessary to shut down printing. Its thirty employees were not released. Two months after the closure of New Yorker Volkszeitung, a new publication, Neue Volkszeitung, was launched as its successor.

Unlit three dimensional letters that are applied to sign panels or monuments are usually referred to as dimensional letters.  Channel letter types  Face-lit channel letters =Metal construction (standard)= A standard channel letter is a three-dimensional graphic sign element. Its channel is fabricated from sheet metal, most often aluminum since it will not rust. A flat sheet of aluminum is typically cut on a table by a computer- controlled router, laser, or water jet, based on a vector-based art file (.cdr, .eps, .ai, .scv, .sci, or .fs). This creates the back of the channel and is the basis for the letter shape. The sides of the channel letter, called the returns, are then formed by bending a strip of aluminum sheet around the aluminum back. This return can be welded at the seam or flanged and riveted or, with a metal stitcher, can be fastened with galvanized or stainless wire to the back to create a solid can in the shape of the letter. The letter can is painted and fitted with any lighting components necessary such as neon gas tubes or light-emitting diode (LED) modules. A translucent plastic face usually of thick sheet acrylic fiber or polycarbonate is cut to fit the open face of the letter can. A trim cap border is applied to its edges which gives the letter face a finished appearance and creates a fastening surface to attach it to the letter can. When illuminated at night, channel letters draw the eye of passers-by. The face can also be applied with black perforated vinyl, so the letters appear black in the daytime and white when lit at night. For the best effect, face colors are usually matched with their closest corresponding LED color. A warm white LED is best used with a yellow or orange face.Gemini Professional Signage Catalog, 2016, Gemini Signs and Letters, p. 154. Since the advent of LED lighting technology, channel letters have become thinner in depth, decreasing to as shallow as from , a trend which began in Europe, and is seen increasingly in the United States.Thin Is In, by Don Harford, Sign and Digital Graphics Magazine, June 2016, p. 10. =Exposed neon channel letter= These are standard channel letters, but the neon is covered with a clear acrylic face to keep birds from making a nest as well as to protect the exposed neon from outside elements, i.e., weather, etc. This allows for the exposed neon to be seen, as well as the inside of the channel letter interior itself to add to the dimensional look. =Plastic formed Channel Letters= Formed channel letters feature a molded plastic backer with a raised lip. A plastic molded cover snaps over the base. The cover, or face, can be flat, round or \\"prismatic\\" (faceted face) and is made from translucent light-diffusing colored plastic. Light is emitted from both the face and the sides of the letter. Cut vinyl can also be applied to the face to create various colored light effects, or to produce a halo effect. The plastic face can also be made with a translucent chrome finish so the letters appear chrome by day, but still light up at night.Gemini Professional Signage Catalog, 2016, Gemini Signs and Letters, p. 152-153. =Back (Halo)-lit or reverse-lit letters= For Back (Halo)-lit channel letters, the face of the letter is constructed from aluminum and the lighting is directed to the back. This light floods the wall that the letter is mounted to and creates a negative space at night. Letters in this style are also called halo letters. It is usually the most expensive form to manufacture. LEDs are installed to the inside back of the can, and the back is often fitted with a clear or translucent plastic back to diffuse the light and protect the lighting elements and wiring. The letters are typically mounted 1-1/2\\" from the wall so they are set off from the fa√ßade of the building. The inside of the can is often painted white to reflect light. The effect of the halo lighting allows for a variety of creative effects depending on the color, sheen, and texture of the building surface. Light-colored building surfaces with a matte finish produce the best halo effect; dark mirror-like finishes the worst.Gemini Professional Signage Catalog, 2016, Gemini Signs and Letters, p. 84, 85, 163. =Face and Back (Halo)-lit letters= These letters combine the same features of a face and back-lit letter. The inside of the can is usually not painted white.Gemini Professional Signage Catalog, 2016, Gemini Signs and Letters, p. 85.  Mounting  Channel letters may be flush mounted (attached directly to the building facade), or they may be mounted on a raceway or wireway. A raceway is a rectangular mounting structure which serves as both a container for the sign's electrical components (such as a power supply) and a mounting structure. A wireway also serves as a mounting structure but typically contains only wiring. It is thinner and broader than a raceway, and may also be used as a backer panel for the channel letter set. Face-lit letters may also be mounted so they rest on the top the building surface with a bottom and top rail supported by metal arms.

It is now called the Bear Mountain Inn & Conference Center and features the 1915 Cafe and the Bear Mountain Trading Company gift store. A renovation was completed in April 2012. History The building is among the earliest examples of the type of rustic park lodges common in state and national parks. Construction required two years at a cost variously reported as $100,000 and $150,000. It was designed by the New York City firm of Tooker & Marsh in a style strongly influenced by the Adirondack Great Camps. Stone used in the foundations, wall facades and the two remarkably large fireplaces, was obtained from old walls on the properties acquired for Bear Mountain State Park. Chestnut timber used for framing, certain trim, siding and floor covering, was also obtained from local park lands and milled on site. Despite appearances to the contrary, the building's basic framework is constructed of steel. The 1915 cellar contained an electric lighting plant that was also planned to furnish power for an escalator from the excursion boat landing on the Hudson River to the plateau on which the inn stands. The ground floor included a luncheon counter while on the second floor veranda \\"moderately priced table d'hote\\" meals were sold. The main dining room offered \\"service equal to any metropolitan restaurant\\". According to a New York Times article published in June 1915, \\"There are no windows or doors. When cool weather comes, the upper floor is to be inclosed [sic] in glass\\".The New York Times, June 27, 1915 In 1922-23 the building became a year-round facility with steam heat and enclosed windows. The aim was in part to make it a center for winter sports. Between the 1930s and 1980s changes to the floor plan were made and some historic details and decorative motifs were concealed or lost, and much of the original rustic furniture was removed. A renovation aimed to restore some of these details. When it became used for overnight accommodations, the third floor was initially remodeled as a dormitory. Later, individual guest rooms were installed with shared bath facilities. In 1975, individual bathrooms were installed as part of a larger renovation. At various times during the 1930s and 40s, the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team, the New York Giants football team and the New York Knickerbockers basketball team made the inn and adjacent athletic facilities their training headquarters. Also during this period, entertainment headliners included Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, and some believe Kate Smith wrote her 1931 theme song \\"When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain\\" while at the inn.Images of America: Bear Mt.

The Bank of Georgia. Accessed April 7, 2012.  Architect  George Chakhava (·Éí·Éò·Éù·É†·Éí·Éò ·É©·Éê·ÉÆ·Éê·Éï·Éê) studied architecture at the State Polytechnical University in Tbilisi and graduated in 1949. Since then he has worked as an architect with his own studio and realized projects in Georgia as well as in Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Latvia. The inspiration for his architecture is \\"the unique nature of my country with its individuality and beauty of each region in harmony with mountain villages.\\" Chakhava received several honors and awards. In 1983 he received the State Prize of the USSR Council of Ministers. The Georgian Union of Architects also awarded him with the Special Honor in Architecture. In 1991, he became an Honored Member of the International Academy of the Architecture of the Oriental Countries. Chakhava died on 25 August 2007.  Design  The wooded site lies in the outskirts of Tbilisi at the river Kura River. It has a steep slope, declining from west to east. Big parts of the building are lifted off the ground, the landscape runs through beneath. The structure is visible from far, three major roads leading from Tbilisi to the north pass the site. The building can be entered from both sites, at the higher and lower end. The structure consists of a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms. Five horizontal parts with two stories each seem to be stapled on top of each other. Three parts are oriented at an east-west axis, at a right angle to the slope, two are north-south oriented, along the slope. The structure rests on and hangs from three cores. They contain the vertical circulation elements like stairs and elevators. The highest core has 18 stories. The building has a floor area of 13,500 m2.  Architecture  The design is based on a concept named Space City method (Georgian patent certificate #1538). The idea is to use and cover less ground and give the space below the building back to nature. The architect's reference was a forest: the cores are like the trunk, the horizontal parts the crowns. Between the earth and crowns there is a lot of free space for other living beings, which create one harmonious world with the forest. The Space City method is based on the same principle. This is meant to create an experience of well-being and comfort. The concept that the landscape or nature \\"flows\\" through under the building was used by other architects, too. Le Corbusier worked theoretically on the \\"house on pilotis\\" and realized this idea for example from 1947 on in the Unit√© d'Habitation. Frank Lloyd Wright used a similar idea at Fallingwater in 1935. Glenn Murcutt used the proverb \\"touch this earth lightly\\" literally in some of his designs. A current example is the Mus√©e du quai Branly by Jean Nouvel in Paris, where a garden lies beneath a building. The design goes back to ideas of the Russian constructivists from the 1920s. The architect El Lissitzky designed with his horizontal skyscrapers (Wolkenb√ºgel) 1924 a structure that looks very similar. He also divided the cores and office areas in vertical and horizontal elements as an antithesis to the American concept of the skyscraper.see M√ºller / Vogel: dtv Atlas Baukunst, Band 2, S. 509 (German) The style can be called \\"post- constructivist\\" and it is one of the best examples of this architectural concept in the city. Based on the use of fairfaced concrete and the sharp, geometrical volumes, the building can also be considered as part of the Brutalism movement. The concept of the space city has strong connections to Structuralism. Between Brutalism and Structuralism similar buildings were also built in other countries, for example the Yamanashi Communication Centre in Kofu by Kenzo Tange or Habitat 67 by Moshe Safdie, both finished in 1967. German author Udo Kultermann also sees a formal connection to the user of the building. The structure represents in his opinion the internal use by the formal reference to streets and bridges. Describing the building, The New York Times architecture critic Nikolai Ouroussoff said, \\"Rising on an incline between two highways, the building‚Äôs heavy cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. The composition of interlocking forms, conceived as a series of bridges, brings to mind the work of the Japanese Metabolists of the late ‚Äô60s and early ‚Äô70s, proof that Soviet architects weren‚Äôt working in an intellectual vacuum.\\"Soviet Architects and Their Edifice Complex. New York Times (May 16, 2007)  Design controversy  The design is alleged to be stolen from a building that was planned but not built in the Prague district of Ko≈°√≠≈ôe, by Czech architect Karel Prager, who also designed the former Federal Assembly building in Prague. Includes gallery of images. There is a version of some of the structural ideas of this project in the \\"Tree of Life\\" (√Årbol de la vida) building in Lecherias, Venezuela, by Venezuelan architect Fruto Vivas.

Love and Responsibility: 1981 A new, completely updated and original translation was published in 2013.Translated by Grzegorz Ignatik, published by Pauline Books & Media, Boston, MA. Fr. Wojty≈Ça was originally inspired to write the book while being a professor at the Catholic University of Lublin, through the experiences he had in teaching young Catholics. Background While at the university, Fr. Wojty≈Ça gathered a group of about 20 young people, who began to call themselves ‚ÄòRodzinka‚Äô, the \\"little family\\". They met for prayers, philosophical discussions, and helping the blind and sick. The group eventually grew to approximately 200 participants, and their activities expanded to include annual skiing and kayaking trips. The insight he gained from these meetings and discussions helped him develop the raw material for the text. Description The work consists of five chapters; \\"The Person and the Sexual Urge\\"; \\"The Person and Love\\"; \\"The Person and Chastity\\"; \\"Justice to the Creator\\"; and \\"Sexology and Ethics\\". It is described as 'a defence of the traditional Church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint'. In his introduction to the first edition, Fr. Wojtyla describes his reasons for writing the book as being \\"born principally of the need to put the norms of Catholic sexual morality on a firm basis, a basis as definitive as possible, relying on the most elementary and incontrovertible moral truths and the most fundamental values or goods\\". Fr. Wojty≈Ça writes that marital sexual intercourse is the best image of God who is love, for he sees the human body as the only one capable of making the invisible ‚Äî the spiritual and the divine ‚Äî visible.Karol Woytyla, Love and Responsibility, San Francisco, Ignatius Press 1993 He says that human beings were created by God for a purpose: to be persons who freely choose to love, to give themselves as persons who express their self-giving through their bodies. Thus, sexual intercourse between husband and wife is a symbol of their total mutual self-donation, and further fosters, strengthens and enriches it not just for the present but also for the future. For Fr. Wojty≈Ça, \\"The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and divine.\\" Insights into gender Wojty≈Ça's conception of gender flows from his philosophy of the human person. He posits a theistic humanism grounded in Imago Dei: mankind in the image and likeness of God. A human being is an integrated body and soul, with a complementary union of two genders, male and female. Wojty≈Ça's philosophy is based on the phenomenological tradition, which deals with the subjective experience of humans and how culture, language, upbringing, and biases all affect the way individuals see the objective world. The ethical system he presents appears heavily centered on actions and deeds. However he argues that there is a metaphysical reality in which human subjects realize themselves and ground themselves in it by acting in freedom. Specifically, the metaphysical realism is God and His creation of man in His own image and likeness. Yet, there is not a divide between man's subjectiveness and his metaphysical reality. Wojtyla refers to one's own subjective experience as \\"lived experience\\" or \\"inner life\\" and argues that an individual's conscious perception of this interior life is the experience of oneself as an acting self rooted in a metaphysical reality. This interior life of a person rooted in the metaphysical reality of Imago Dei is what shapes John Paul II's conception of gender. He argues that since God is in a triune relation of love, if man is created in His image then man should also be in a relation of love. The complementarity of the two sexes, then, is rooted in a relationship of love, and the very differences between men and women allow them to exist in this relationship together. Since man is a composite of body and soul, and since the body makes visible the invisible nature of the soul, the very fact that men's and women's bodies physically complement each other is proof of their relationship of love. As men and women are both created in Imago Dei they are both equal in dignity, although they are different. For Wojty≈Ça, those differences are what allows men and women to exist coherently together in a union of love, reflecting man's deepest identity. References Sources * * Wojty≈Ça, Karol.

It is found in vertebrates and invertebrates, though its structure varies across species. In humans, the pharynx is part of the digestive system and the conducting zone of the respiratory system. (The conducting zone‚Äîwhich also includes the nostrils of the nose, the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles‚Äîfilters, warms and moistens air and conducts it into the lungs). The human pharynx is conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. It is also important in vocalization. In humans, two sets of pharyngeal muscles form the pharynx and determine the shape of its lumen. They are arranged as an inner layer of longitudinal muscles and an outer circular layer. Structure Nasopharynx The upper portion of the pharynx, the nasopharynx, extends from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate.Clinical Head and Neck and Functional Neuroscience Course Notes, 2008-2009, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences School of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland It includes the space between the internal nares and the soft palate and lies above the oral cavity. The adenoids, also known as the pharyngeal tonsils, are lymphoid tissue structures located in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is an annular arrangement of lymphoid tissue in both the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The nasopharynx is lined by respiratory epithelium that is pseudostratified, columnar, and ciliated. Upper respiratory system, with nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx labeled at right. Polyps or mucus can obstruct the nasopharynx, as can congestion due to an upper respiratory infection. The auditory tube, which connect the middle ear to the pharynx, opens into the nasopharynx at the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube. The opening and closing of the auditory tubes serves to equalize the barometric pressure in the middle ear with that of the ambient atmosphere. Details of torus tubarius The anterior aspect of the nasopharynx communicates through the choanae with the nasal cavities. On its lateral wall is the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube, somewhat triangular in shape, and bounded behind by a firm prominence, the torus tubarius or cushion, caused by the medial end of the cartilage of the tube which elevates the mucous membrane. Two folds arise from the cartilaginous opening: * the salpingopharyngeal fold, a vertical fold of mucous membrane extending from the inferior part of the torus and containing the salpingopharyngeus muscle * the salpingopalatine fold, a smaller fold, in front of the salpingopharyngeal fold, extending from the superior part of the torus to the palate and containing the levator veli palatini muscle. It also contains some muscle fibres called salpingopalatine muscle The tensor veli palatini is lateral to the levator and does not contribute to the fold, since the origin is deep to the cartilaginous opening. Oropharynx The oropharynx lies behind the oral cavity, extending from the uvula to the level of the hyoid bone. It opens anteriorly, through the isthmus faucium, into the mouth, while in its lateral wall, between the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch, is the palatine tonsil. The anterior wall consists of the base of the tongue and the epiglottic vallecula; the lateral wall is made up of the tonsil, tonsillar fossa, and tonsillar (faucial) pillars; the superior wall consists of the inferior surface of the soft palate and the uvula. Because both food and air pass through the pharynx, a flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes over the glottis when food is swallowed to prevent aspiration. The oropharynx is lined by non-keratinised squamous stratified epithelium. The HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella) are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora, which grow slowly, prefer a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere, and share an enhanced capacity to produce endocardial infections, especially in young children. Fusobacterium is a pathogen. Laryngopharynx The laryngopharynx, (Latin: pars laryngea pharyngis), also known as hypopharynx, is the caudal part of the pharynx; it is the part of the throat that connects to the esophagus. It lies inferior to the epiglottis and extends to the location where this common pathway diverges into the respiratory (laryngeal) and digestive (oesophageal) pathways. At that point, the laryngopharynx is continuous with the esophagus posteriorly. The esophagus conducts food and fluids to the stomach; air enters the larynx anteriorly. During swallowing, food has the \\"right of way\\", and air passage temporarily stops. Corresponding roughly to the area located between the 4th and 6th cervical vertebrae, the superior boundary of the laryngopharynx is at the level of the hyoid bone. The laryngopharynx includes three major sites: the pyriform sinus, postcricoid area, and the posterior pharyngeal wall. Like the oropharynx above it, the laryngopharynx serves as a passageway for food and air and is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. It is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus. The vascular supply to the laryngopharynx includes the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. The primary neural supply is from both the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. The vagus nerve provides an auricular branch also termed \\"Arnold's nerve\\" which also supplies the external auditory canal, thus laryngopharyngeal cancer can result in referred ear pain. This nerve is also responsible for the ear-cough reflex in which stimulation of the ear canal results in a person coughing. Clinical significance Pharyngitis is the painful swelling of the throat. The oropharynx shown here is very inflamed and red. Inflammation Inflammation of the pharynx, or pharyngitis, is the painful inflammation of the throat.  Pharyngeal cancer  Pharyngeal cancer is a cancer that originates in the neck and/or throat, and can cause serious clinical problems.  Waldeyer's tonsillar ring  Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is an anatomical term collectively describing the annular arrangement of lymphoid tissue in the pharynx. Waldeyer's ring circumscribes the naso- and oropharynx, with some of its tonsillar tissue located above and some below the soft palate (and to the back of the oral cavity). It is believed that Waldeyer's ring prevents the invasion of microorganisms from going into the air and food passages and this helps in the defense mechanism of the respiratory and alimentary systems. History Etymology The word pharynx (OED 2nd edition, 1989.Entry \\"pharynx\\" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, retrieved 2012-07-28.) is derived from the Greek œÜŒ¨œÅœÖŒ≥Œæ ph√°rynx, meaning \\"throat\\". Its plural form is pharynges or pharynxes , and its adjective form is pharyngeal ( or ). Other vertebrates All vertebrates have a pharynx, used in both feeding and respiration. The pharynx arises during development in all vertebrates through a series of six or more outpocketings on the lateral sides of the head. These outpocketings are pharyngeal arches, and they give rise to a number of different structures in the skeletal, muscular, and circulatory systems. The structure of the pharynx varies across the vertebrates. It differs in dogs, horses, and ruminants. In dogs a single duct connects the nasopharynx to the nasal cavity. The tonsils are a compact mass which point away from the lumen of the pharynx. In the horse the auditory tube opens into the guttural pouch and the tonsils are diffuse and raised slightly. Horses are unable to breathe through the mouth as the free apex of the rostral epiglottis lies dorsal to the soft palate in a normal horse. In ruminants the tonsils are a compact mass which point towards the lumen of the pharynx. Pharyngeal arches Pharyngeal arches are characteristic features of vertebrates whose origin can be traced back through chordates to basal deuterostomes who also share endodermal outpocketings of the pharyngeal apparatus. Similar patterns of gene expression can be detected in the developing pharynx of amphioxus and hemichordates. However, the vertebrate pharynx is unique in that it gives rise to endoskeletal support through the contribution of neural crest cells. Pharyngeal jaws  An illustration of the pharyngeal jaws of a moray eel Pharyngeal jaws are a \\"second set\\" of jaws contained within the pharynx of many species of fish, distinct from the primary (oral) jaws. Pharyngeal jaws have been studied in moray eels where their specific action is noted. When the moray bites prey, it first bites normally with its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they then retract, pulling the prey down the eel's esophagus, allowing it to be swallowed. Invertebrates Invertebrates also have a pharynx. Invertebrates with a pharynx include the tardigrades, annelids and arthropods, and the priapulids (which have an eversible pharynx). The \\"pharynx\\" of the nematode worm is a muscular food pump in the head, triangular in cross-section, that grinds food and transports it directly to the intestines. A one-way valve connects the pharynx to the excretory canal.

Early years and education Born in Warsaw, Zadara left Poland with his parents when he was three years old and moved to Austria, and then to West Germany. He attended English-language schools. In 1994 he began studying Political Science at Swarthmore College, near Philadelphia. After two years of study, he took a leave of absence from Swarthmore, and studied directing at the Theatre Academy in Warsaw, and then oceanography at Sea Education Association in Massachusetts. Upon returning to Swarthmore he changed his major to Theatre Studies, and earned his B.A. with honors with a minor in Political Science in 1999. After his studies, he moved to New York, where he worked as a publicity assistant, theatrical carpenter and computerized-banking assistant. He also directed one show at the no longer existing off-off-broadway stage Collective Unconscious. In the year 2000 he returned to Poland. After being rejected from the Krak√≥w Theatre School, he worked as an assistant and collaborator of set designer Ma≈Çgorzata Szczƒô≈õniak at Warsaw's Rozmaito≈õci Theatre. In 2001 he was accepted and began studying at the Directing Department of the Krak√≥w Theatre School. Theatre career Since 2004 Zadara has directed more than thirty plays and performance art pieces at The Wybrze≈ºe Theatre in Gda≈Ñsk, Stary National Theatre in Krak√≥w, Wsp√≥≈Çczesny Theatre in Wroc≈Çaw, National Theatre in Warsaw, Wsp√≥≈Çczesny Theatre in Szczecin, the Maxim Gorki Theatre in Berlin, the HaBima National Theatre in Tel Aviv, the Schauspielhaus Wien and a staging of Iannis Xenakis's opera Oresteia at the National Opera in Warsaw. He was nominated for the Political Passport prize in 2006 and 2007, and was awarded this prize - the Polish equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize - in 2007. His 2007 production of Witold Gombrowicz's Operetta was presented in the 2009 Philadelphia Live Arts Festival. In 2010, Zadara and his partner Barbara Wysocka created the much-discussed performance piece \\"Anty-Edyp\\", in which Wysocka, then 8 months pregnant, performed a version of Sophocles's Oedipus, while two doctors examined her heart and her unborn child's heart using USG. The images and sound from the USG created the visual and musical frame of the performance, as three musicians played the score, using the child's heartbeat as the basic rhythm. The text of was inspired by and included fragments of Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus.Burzynska, Anna (January 2015). \\"Barbara Wysocka - Alles oder Nichts\\". Max Joseph, das Magazin der Bayerischen Staatsoper, p. 39 In 2011, Zadara created a theatrical installation of Joseph Roth's novel \\"Hotel Savoy\\" at the original Hotel Savoy in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, in the building, where Roth's novel takes place - which was then still a functioning hotel. The spectators walked through the entire seven floors of the old building and its courtyard, while scenes and music were played simultaneously, so that no spectator could ever see the whole installation. In 2013, Zadara co-founded CENTRALA, an independent organization that produces innovative art. In the following years, CENTRALA produced performances, exhibits, films and concerts. Centrala's innovative ways of production, creation, and presentation have resulted in collaborations with Warsaw's Modern Art Museum, the Warsaw Uprising Museum, and the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, among others. In 2015 with Pew Center support, Swarthmore College brought the North American premiere of Centrala's Chopin Without Piano, created by Zadara and performed by Centrala member Barbara Wysocka, to Philadelphia, with performances at Swarthmore College and FringeArts. In 2014, Zadara began a three-year-long project at the Teatr Polski in Wroc≈Çaw to stage the first ever full production of Adam Mickiewicz's epic drama Dziady. This text is one of the most fundamental theatre text in Polish culture, but has never been staged in its entirety. The full version of the play was presented in February 2016, and the performance lasted 14 hours. In the 2019/2020 academic year, Zadara was appointed to the position of Cornell Distinguished Visiting Professor at Swarthmore College to teach a course on the contemporary staging of Greek Tragedy in the Theatre and Classics Departments. On April 24, 2020, his production of Sophocles's Women of Trachis opened at Swarthmore - the staging was widely covered in the press, as the play was performed without an audience and without actors.https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/no-one-will- ever-see-this-play-and-no-actors-are-coming-either-but-the-show-will-go- on/2020/04/24/fcc8a09c-8577-11ea-878a-86477a724bdb_story.html References External links *Micha≈Ç Zadara at Culture.pl Category:Polish theatre directors Category:Swarthmore College alumni Category:1976 births Category:Living people ","title":"Micha≈Ç Zadara"},{"id":"21581924","text":"Merrill Brown is a media executive and journalist.

Michael Caine also had a small role in the film, early in his career. It is set during the Second World War, in the Tunisian desert when a small British observation force are surrounded in a farm by overwhelming forces of the German Afrika Korps. Filming took place on Salisbury Plain, which doubled for North Africa. Plot Tunisia 1943 As the end of the North African Campaign draws to a close, and the German and Italian forces are being pushed back on Tunis. A company of British Infantry are tasked with holding a small Arab farm against an expected last-ditch counter-attack; the farm's water tower will be used as an observation point by a few Royal Artillery spotters. To defend the farm British Lt. Colonel Derry picks a company led by Major Alan Gerrard; these men have been in the thick of the fighting around Tunis and are greatly reduced in number (described by the narrator as down to barely two platoons). So Gerrard's company set out on foot for the farm; on the way they are joined by Captain Dickie Mead and his signaller, Ames. Arriving at the farm, Gerrard's men chase out the occupants and dig slit trenches out in front of the farm. With the water tower and its ladder in clear view, Mead decides to wait until just before dawn to climb the tower while it is still dark. The next day Mead uses his position to target the artillery onto the German forces, all is going well until the Germans send out a reconnaissance patrol to pin point the observation post, which Gerrard's men dispose of. With the Germans sure of their position, it becomes a test of nerve for Gerrard's men, seasoned troops and new boys alike. All of them stick it out until they are finally ordered to retreat with their job done. Mead decides to stay behind and cover their escape with artillery fire, leading to the death of Sergeant Major Gill and Private Middleditch. And when Mead finally succumbs to German fire, only the wounded Gerrard is left. With the Germans in the farm and his surviving men well on their way to safety, the mortally wounded Gerrard radios for the artillery to totally destroy the farm, killing Gerrard and the Germans' last chance at the same time.

Agelastica alni is distributed in Europe, the Caucasus, Siberia, north-eastern Kazakhstan, and in the 19th century was introduced to the United States. The beetle and the beetle's larval host is the grey or speckled alder (Alnus incana) and to a lesser extent black alder (Alnus glutinosa), but it will also be found on hazel, birch or hornbeam if there is a shortage of food. It causes large holes and gaps in leaves from the end of April onwards, which are produced by the larvae in the first two stages, but the main damage is produced by larvae in the third stage. Previously rare, and considered extinct in the UK, since being found in Manchester in 2004 it appears to be on the increase in the North West of England. Its range has been extending and it was found in Nottinghamshire and Hampshire in 2014 and in North Wales in 2018. Description The alder leaf beetle is a relatively small beetle, around 6‚Äì7 mm, black or metallic blue in colour. The winged adults overwinter and emerge in the spring. There is one generation each year. The larvae are normally black. Although the damage to alder trees can be unsightly, the trees will usually tolerate the damage.

KG is a German sports car manufacturer based in Delbr√ºck, Germany. Founded by Klaus Dieter Frers in 2006, the company's first product was a mid-engined sports coup√© released in 2007. In early 2010 a private equity and venture capital firm that already held a stake in Artega took full control. Artega filed for bankruptcy in July 2012. It was reacquired by a company under Frers' control that same year and eventually resumed production, specializing in electric vehicles. Company Artega was founded by Klaus Dieter Frers, a mechanical engineer who worked for AEG-Telefunken before moving to Nixdorf Computer to oversee their production facilities from 1983 to 1987. Frers established a company called paragon electronics GmbH in 1988, and another called paragon AG in 1999, into which paragon electronic GmbH was merged. paragon AG specialises in electronic modules, controls and display systems for the automotive industry. Frers is also one of the principals of Voltabox Deutschland GmbH, as well as a car collector and competitor in historic racing. Frers founded Artega Automobil in 2006. The name of the company was suggested by Manfred Gotta, a German brand-development expert. The company previewed their first sports car, the Artega GT, at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show as an engineless prototype. A production-ready version appeared at the Geneva Auto Show one year later, labelled the Intro 2008 special edition. Production of the car started in 2009. In interviews in 2008, chief adviser Karl-Heinz Kalbfell indicated that the next models anticipated were a soft-top version and a 4-cylinder car. On 25 January 2010, Mexican investment firm Tresalia Capital assumed control of Artega. At a later date there was a change in management, with Frers leaving the company and Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Ziebart, former Head of Continental AG and Infineon AG, becoming CEO of Artega. In March 2011, Artega unveiled an electric version of the GT called the Artega SE (for Sports Electric). A Targa variant of the GT with a glass roof was shown at the Geneva Auto Show in March 2012. In July of the same year the company filed for bankruptcy protection, and what was expected to be the final GT built rolled off the production line in September. On 1 October 2012, paragon AG assumed control of Artega. This put Frers once again in charge of the car company. The decision was described as an acquisition of Artega's technology, staff and other assets, with no plan to restart automobile production. At the 2015 International Motor Show in Frankfurt Artega showed two new products; the Scalo, a fully electric sports coup√©, and the Karo, an ATV-like vehicle that was also electric. In 2017 Artega brought the new Scalo Superelletra three-seat coup√© to the Geneva Auto Show. In December 2018, Artega announced the acquisition of the production rights for the Swiss electric car Microlino.https://www.electrive.com/2018/12/04/extra-small-electric-car- microlino-to-be-made-in-germany/ Models GT Artega GT The Artega GT was a two-seat hardtop coup√© with a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The car was built on an aluminum space-frame chassis, with carbon-fibre- reinforced bodywork. Suspension front and rear was by unequal-length upper and lower A-arms with coil-over dampers. Mechanical design was handled by Hardy Essig, formerly the technical designer for Porsche. Henrik Fisker, who had designed the Aston Martin DB9, styled the car. Power came from a direct- injection version of Volkswagen's VR6 engine. In the GT this engine was mounted transversely behind the driver and produced . Maximum torque of was produced at 2400 rpm. Power went to the rear wheels through a 6-speed Volkswagen DSG transaxle. The Artega GT weighed without passengers. Artega claimed that the GT could accelerate from in less than 5 seconds and had a top speed of more than . In Germany the Artega GT was priced at ‚Ç¨74,948 or $104,000 with taxes. SE The Artega SE was based on the GT, using the same aluminum space frame and basic bodywork, but was powered by a pair of electric motors producing a combined . On-board energy storage was a water- cooled battery pack that weighed and stored at 350 Volts. At , the SE weighed more than the GT, but had slightly greater acceleration. The car's range was estimated to be , depending on driving style. Artega said that the price would be ‚Ç¨150,000 (approx. US$212,500). Scalo Artega Scalo The Scalo first appeared at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show. A refined version of the SE, the Scalo was considered the successor to the GT by Artega. Power came from two Voltabox electric motors that combined to produce and . The actively-cooled battery pack could store 37kWh of energy at 411 volts and combined Lithium-ion battery cells with supercapacitors. The name of the car was borrowed from that of a famous racehorse. Karo Artega Karo The Artega Karo appeared at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto show alongside the Scalo. The Karo was a quadricycle with electric drive. Resembling a road-going ATV \\"Quad\\", the Karo could carry a driver and one passenger riding two-up style. The battery pack had a capacity of 5.3 kWh, and the vehicle was to offered with three different motors with different power levels, depending on the rider's age and skill level. For the 17 kW version the vehicle could accelerate from in 4.5 seconds. The Karo also came with a built-in wireless cellphone charger and a detachable sound system. Scalo Superelletra Artega Scalo Superelletra The Scalo Superelletra debuted at the 2017 Geneva Auto Show. The car's name combines that of the earlier Scalo with a portmanteau of the Italian Superleggera and elettrica, indicating light weight and electric drive. Designed by Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera, the new car was longer than the original Scalo and featured a new carbon-fibre monocoque chassis. Motive power is still electric, with a quartet of motors, one at each wheel, capable of producing a total of . The car is to carry the driver and two passengers, seated three-abreast with the driver in the middle. Related IISB-One The IISB-One is a car that began life as an Artega GT and was modified to accept an electric drivetrain by the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology. The car received two electric motors to drive the rear wheels and a lithium battery pack to power them. Each motor was capable of delivering up to to its associated wheel. The car was also a test-bed for a variety of charging system, having three different system on board. Motorsports Artega's racing arm, Artega Rennsport, fielded an Artega GT prepared for racing (and relabeled GTR) at the N√ºrburgring in 2011. In 2014 a one-make series called the Artega GT Cup was started.

These included financial benefits such as pensions; educational benefits such as vocational rehabilitation and student aid; and employment benefits such as job security, insurance and reemployment rights. The Commission did not study hospital treatment or other medical benefits. In the course of its work, the staff collected extensive information from various government agencies which dealt with veterans. Of particular importance was the U.S. Veterans Administration. Other agencies which assisted the Commission included the Labor and Defense Departments, the Social Security Administration, and the Railroad Retirement Board. The staff also made surveys of randomly selected veterans in order to develop statistical analyses of the use and effectiveness of various benefit programs. The studies compiled by the staff pertained to all major areas of non-medical veterans benefits and included studies of the historical background of benefits, how benefits were administered, eligibility requirements, distinctions between service-connected and non-service-connected benefits, and benefits granted to survivors of veterans. The staff even studied benefits granted by the Canadian government in order to compare them with U.S. benefits. These studies were submitted to Congress by the Commission and were published in 16 volumes by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.

Design In 1948, US aircraft test pilot/aircraft designer W.J. Morrisey produced a wood- and-fabric light aircraft, the 1000C (Nifty). In 1958 he reworked that basic design, giving it an all-metal structure and increased power. The aircraft is a cantilever low-wing monoplane with plain ailerons and two-position trailing- edge flaps, conventional empennage, fixed nosewheel landing gear, and tandem seating. Dual controls are provided as standard equipment. Development In 1958 The Morrisey Aviation Inc. company began building the re-designed aircraft. Two units were completed as the Morrisey 2000. A further improvement came with the Morrisey 2150, incorporating a 108 hp Lycoming O-235 engine. The company built nine aircraft by the end of 1959.Simpson 2001 p. 565 Morrisey 2150A built in 1962. The construction and design rights were then sold to Shinn Engineering Inc. which built 35 improved Shinn 2150A aircraft with a Lycoming O-320-A2C engine, before ceasing production in 1962.Simpson 2005, p. 201 The 2150A design rights were sold in 1967 to used aircraft parts supplier George Varga who formed the Varga Aircraft Corporation. The Varga 2150A Kachina was built at Chandler, Arizona between 1975 and 1982. 121 2150A Kachinas were completed together with 18 examples of the Varga 2180 with a 180 hp Lycoming O-360-A2D engine. A tailwheel option was available as the Varga 2150TG. Bill Morrisey later re-acquired the design rights and then launched a kit version of the original Morrisey 2000C.

He attended high school in Bainbridge and enrolled at Indiana University in 1883, graduating with a B.A. in 1887 and an M.A. in 1891. There he worked under ichthyologist David Starr Jordan and geologist John Casper Branner. Blatchley received an honorary degree (LL.D.) from Indiana University in 1921. From 1887-1893 he taught at Terre Haute High School where he was Head of the Science Department from 1887-1893. From 1894-1910 he was State Geologist for Indiana. After being defeated for re-election in 1911, he retired from public office, but continued his natural history work as an amateur.

One of them, Marian Cozma, was killed. Circumstances During the summer of 2008 the mafia clan of the Raffael and Sztojka Romani families based in the town of Enying, Hungary started to take power in the nightlife of the northern shore of Lake Balaton, a major tourist destination of Hungary. Si√≥fok was a favorite place of the clan and frequently caused problem for the owners since they often made quarrels and did not pay their bills. Not a long time before the case, two of the three suspected persons (including Iv√°n Sztojka) were released from prison after the duration of their prison sentence was mitigated by one third because of \\"good behavior\\". Witnesses from Enying have stated that the town is under the terror of the clan. Residents claim to know the clan's gathering point, a gas station. Locals allege that not long before the murder, the police stopped a truck loaded with supposedly stolen metal but the driver threatened the policeman while sticking a pistol in his mouth. (Metal theft by organized crime gangs is a serious problem in Hungary, having caused traffic delays and power and telephone outages.) However, police denies that the crime rate of Enying is above average. The Patri√≥ta Lok√°l, the scene of the murder is a bar mostly serving as a club with a stable guest circle (including the handball team). In 2008, the bar won the town's \\"safe bar prize\\". 7 February 2009 In the afternoon on Saturday, 7 February 2009, a criminal from Veszpr√©m, who had just left the prison knocked down one of the members of the clan, who suffered severe injuries. The clan-member organized a group of family and friends from the villages of Enying and D√©g (different sources cite 15, 20 or 30 people, including suspected Iv√°n Sztojka, S√°ndor Raffael and Gy≈ëz≈ë N√©meth) to take a vengeance and started to search for the person in Veszpr√©m at night to \\"settle\\" the problem. They thought the person would stay that night at the bar called Patri√≥ta Lok√°l (English: Patriot local) also known as Skorpi√≥ b√°r (English: Scorpion bar). 8 February 2009 Cozma and other members of the KC Veszpr√©m handball team (including Croat goalkeeper Ivan Pe≈°iƒá and Serb playmaker ≈Ωarko ≈†e≈°um) arrived at the two- storey bar at around 12:30 a.m. to celebrate the birth of teammate Gerg≈ë Iv√°ncsik's son and the birthday of teammate Nikola Eklemoviƒá. They stayed in the dance hall in the lower storey (basement). The upper storey serves as a cocktail bar. A group of 15 arrived at the bar between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. They went down into the crowded dance hall and three of them - Raffael, Sztojka and N√©meth - immediately started to banter others. Many people - shocked by the appearance of the never-seen-before gang - left the place. As CCTV recordings shows, the gang of 3 picked on the sportsmen and attacked them without any reason. Subsequently, the music was shut down and people started to flee the place. The recordings of the camera over the stairway show Cozma running up to the exit pursued by his attackers. In front of the bar, Cozma was stabbed in the back, and he collapsed. Raffael then went up to him and stabbed him twice in the heart. When his teammates wanted to help Cozma, the other two attackers - Sztojka and N√©meth - stabbed Pe≈°iƒá in the kidney and kicked ≈†e≈°um in the head. Police denied the rumors about the bartender girl being assaulted. The police who arrived at the scene resuscitated Cozma, and the three injured players were taken to a hospital. Cozma died in the hospital two hours later. Pe≈°iƒá had to have his kidney removed, and ≈†e≈°um suffered severe craniocerebral trauma from the kick to the head. The murder was caught on tape by nearby surveillance cameras, and records proved that the person who actually killed Cozma was S√°ndor Raffael. Three men were wanted in connection of the crime, Iv√°n Sztojka, Gy≈ëz≈ë N√©meth and S√°ndor Raffael. Aftermath Footage showing Gy≈ëz≈ë N√©meth, the second suspect in the murder case, handcuffed and being detained by the Austrian police became publicly available. The newspaper Magyar H√≠rlap published an editorial on the case. Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny, the Hungarian prime minister criticized the newspaper, saying that the gravity of the criminal act is to be considered, not the ethnic origin of the suspects. After a nationwide manhunt which included setting up a special investigative unit and offering 2 million Hungarian Forints (approximately ‚Ç¨7,000) for information on the suspect's whereabouts, Iv√°n Sztojka gave himself up at the Veszpr√©m Police station on the night of 12 February, at the pressures of the leader of his Romani community.Sztojka s-a predat la presiunile bulibasei He allegedly denied his participation in the crime, stating that he was only \\"at the wrong place at a wrong time\\". Petre Cozma, Marian Cozma's father, consistently said that not all Roma should be considered guilty for his son's death. He stated, \\"Let's not burn a forest for a sapless stub\\".Padurea si ciotul J√°nos Lad√°nyi, a Hungarian sociologist, was of the opinion that the anti-gypsy attitude reached such an irrational level that even a civil war was possible. Attacks against Romani people in Hungary have been recorded after the incident, however, there is no evidence of racist motive in either case. In 2011, two of the men who killed Cozma, Sandor Raffael and Gyozo Nemeth, got life sentences, while a third defendant, Ivan Sztojka, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Raffael claimed to regret his actions, stating to the court: ‚ÄúThe greatest sin a man can commit is take the life of another human being.‚Äù Later, the sentences were shortened: Sandor Raffael and Gyozo Nemeth received 18-year prison sentences, while Ivan Sztojka was sentenced to 13 years in jail.

The series takes place centuries in the future, where humans and other species have come together to form the Interplanetary Alliance, a federation government of numerous planets. The Alliance's military includes not only the Space Legion, but also the Regular Army and Starfleet. The Space Legion is considered the lowest on the totem pole, and the laughingstock of the armed forces. Space Legion protocol has all persons using a pseudonym chosen upon enlistment, and commissions are purchased. It is a violation of Legion rules to release another Legion member's real name, but not to reveal one's own.Robert Asprin, Phule's Company, Ace Books. After being court-martialed for inadvertently ordering the strafing of a peace conference, Captain Jester is shipped off to command the Omega Company, a dumping ground for the Legion's foul-ups and misfits. Applying his well honed business sense to the running of the unit, he soon turns it around, winning the almost fanatical loyalty of his troops and turning the \\"Omega Mob\\", as it is affectionately nicknamed, into a crack unit. In each book, General Blitzkrieg contrives to send the unit on yet another 'impossible' assignment. They usually manage to come through unscathed. The names of many in the series are based on puns. Main characters Willard Phule Willard J. Phule is the super-rich heir apparent of Phule-Proof Munitions, currently serving in the Space Legion. His Legion name is Jester, and holds the rank of Captain, being addressed thus as Captain Jester, and occasionally and inappropriately as Captain Phule or Captain Clown. Originally having the Legion name was Lieutenant Scaramouche, Phule was brought up on charges and to be court-martialed for ordering the strafing of a peace conference, owing, as he put it, to a ‚Äúcommunications error.‚Äù Since Phule-Proof is the Legion's arms and munitions supplier as well as the largest employer of their retirees, Legion Headquarters sees court- martialing the owner‚Äôs son as potentially disastrous. He is instead promoted to the rank of Captain and shipped off to Haskin's Planet to command the Omega Company, a dumping ground for the Legion's foul-ups and misfits. It is envisioned that this posting to such an unruly, undesirable outfit might encourage him to resign his commission. Phule is no fool, and recognizes this promotion's true intent. However, he decides to accept the challenge. Instead of the potentially abysmal assignment it was meant to be he sets out using his business acumen and determination to turn around the unruly ‚ÄúOmega Mob‚Äù into a crack military unit, giving the Jester the last laugh. Phule is a strong- willed individual, with a strong dislike for stereotyping, and not infrequently finds himself in conflict with other authority figures such as his father. Although of a wealthy background, he takes pride that his own fortune is largely self-made: although he started his business empire with a loan from his father, that loan was swiftly repaid. He is also very loyal to his people, going far above what officers would normally do for their soldiers and reacting aggressively to insults towards them. However, Phule can be over- industrious: he has been known to work himself to the point of exhaustion. He is not above using his enormous wealth to buy his way out of a situation, but typically does so only as a last resort. He is also not above using his real name and status to bully or cajole others into doing what he wants. However, regardless of how he wins a personal confrontation, he is always supremely magnanimous in victory and can usually manage to win over the person he's in conflict with. His not inconsiderable talents include finance, group dynamics, military tactics and strategy, leadership, and public relations. Beeker Phule's butler, confidante, and the narrator throughout the series. Though not technically a member of the unit, Beeker is highly respected by most of the company, and often provides its members with sage advice. While he has become quite wealthy in his years of service to Phule, he is still manifestly determined to continue his service to Phule out of companionship and friendship. Top Sergeant Brandy The Company First Sergeant, Brandy is the stereotypical hard-bitten veteran. In Phule's Paradise, Tusk-anini speculates that she is in love with Captain Jester and unaware of the fact. She is one of three female members of Phule's Company who became centerfold models without his knowledge. Although a physical description is not given in the stories beyond the fact that she is a very big woman, but not fat, you get the impression that she is Amazonian: very good looking, in early middle age, over 6 feet tall, and thoroughly three-dimensional. She is also an old hand at brawling. In one scene she got in a scuffle with Tusk-anini, a alien (see below) and even after he knocked her down with the first punch, she put him in the hospital with a concussion. All in all, a great lady to have on your side when things get tough. Lt Rembrandt The senior of Phule's two junior officers, Rembrandt is also an aspiring artist. Beeker notes that before meeting Phule she specialised in landscapes, but after he took over the company she expressed an interest in painting a nude portrait of him. Rembrant, or \\"Remmie\\", initially lacks confidence and is content to let the NCO's run the company. Phule's major concern with her is teaching her to develop the habit of command, to trust her judgement, and to learn to exercise her authority. When circumstances put her in command of the Omega Mob in Phule's Paradise, she performs decisively, including standing up to Colonel Battleaxe, Phule's immediate superior, when the situation required her to do so. Although Battleaxe recommended her for a command of her own, like Lt. Armstrong she is content to remain as one of Phule's subordinates. Lt Armstrong The son of a heroic but dead military officer, Armstrong is initially an uptight caricature of the career Regular Army officer. A rant he delivers while drunk reveals he resents living in the shadow of his father, whom he feels he can never live up to because of the man's legendary status. Once Phule takes him under his wing, he begins to loosen up and learns to mix his military bearing along with compassion. At first, Armstrong is jealous of and contemptuous of Lt. Rembrandt, and takes any given opportunity to show her up. He soon learns to see her strengths, however, and the two form an excellent working relationship, helping each other out whenever they can. Like Lt. Rembrandt, he turned down promotion and a command of his own to stay with Captain Jester and the Omega Company. Tusk-anini Tusk-anini (or Tusk) is a Volton (sometimes incorrectly referred to as \\"Voltron\\"), a race with warthog-like features. His species is large and imposing, but pacifistic by nature. Captain Jester paired him with Super Gnat, and this pairing, like most of the other Omega Company partnerships, benefited both partners greatly. He doesn't like to fight but will if necessary, especially to protect his partner (often from her own temper). Tusk does not often take the bit in his teeth, but when he does it is best to step out of his way or do what he is asking you to do. He is the Legionnaire most loyal to Phule. He is also quite intelligent, and since he only sleeps a few minutes a day he spends his wealth of free time reading a daunting variety of human books to better learn the language and culture. He prides himself on not needing a translation device to communicate. Phule promotes him to corporal and makes him the company clerk. Tusk-anini plans to be a teacher after his enlistment is over. Super Gnat The shortest Legionnaire in the unit, the diminutive Super-Gnat has the hottest temper. In the first book, she often exploded at the mere use of the word \\"short\\", even if it did not concern her. Her partnership with Tusk- anini calms her, and while she still has a fiery temper, she learned to control it once she found that Tusk-anini was fighting people who made fun of her, to keep her from getting hurt trying to fight them. It is revealed that she was married to a martial arts instructor, and is a black belt in multiple disciplines. However, when she loses her temper she usually is unable to call upon these skills, and loses most of her impulsive fights. Super-Gnat has taken fencing lessons from Phule and is one of the three female members of Phule's Company who became centerfold models without his knowledge. Sushi The product of a wealthy family, Sushi was acquainted with Phule socially before they separately joined the Space Legion. In Sushi's case this decision was made after he lost a fortune he had embezzled to gambling debts. Sushi eventually initiates a one-man takeover of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Do-Wop Do-Wop is something of a kleptomaniac, and Phule's reason for pairing him with Sushi was similar to the reasons he paired up other members of the unit: to balance each other. In this case, he hoped that Do-Wop would teach Sushi to learn to have fun and relax; and that Sushi could teach Do-Wop to aim a little higher than petty thievery. Unfortunately, their pairing succeeded entirely too well. Now, instead of a petty-grade kleptomaniac and a cold, calculating risktaker that usually held back, Do-Wop and Sushi are Omega Company's greatest masters of larceny. As they also are good planners, they are a force to be reckoned with when the Captain turns them loose on a problem. Rose/Mother A female Legionnaire, the only original member of Omega Company without a partner. She is terrified of other people and is only capable of mumbling incoherently when addressed directly, except when the speaker is a woman. She is highly skilled as the Company's communications coordinator; in Phule's Paradise Tully Bascomb, a legendary casino security chief, suggests she look him up if she ever decides to leave the Legion, to teach \\"eye in the sky\\" security monitoring. The lack of face to face contact is the defining factor of Mother's shyness; when not dealing with people in person, she can be something of a smart-ass until the chips are down. She is one of the three female members of Phule's Company who became centerfold models without his knowledge ‚Äî to his surprise, it was her idea. Escrima Named after the Filipino form of martial arts, Sergeant Escrima is the company's mess sergeant. Hot-tempered, he is a talented chef; he dislikes insults towards his own food or food in general. He is a master in all forms of Philippine martial arts: hand-to-hand combat, knife fighting and especially arnis, Philippine stick fighting. He represented the Omega Mob in a competition against an elite Regular Army unit with the Olympic light saber in Phule's Company and almost defeated him, despite never having fenced before. Chocolate Harry Also known as C.H. The company supply sergeant, Harry has a talent for black-marketeering. He is a former member of the Outlaws, a criminal hover-bike club and still maintains his personal bike. One of his trademarks is wearing sleeveless uniforms. He is partners with Louis, one of the Legion's two Sinthians, who rides in a side-car on Harry's bike, wielding a shotgun. Initially, C.H. doesn't think much of Phule and plans to take advantage of him, but soon learns that Phule is far too intelligent for this and can in fact teach him to play in the big leagues if he toes the line and operates within the parameters Phule gives him. General Blitzkrieg A senior officer and one of the three Directors of the Space Legion, Blitzkrieg has a personal dislike of Phule and would very much like to force him out of the Legion, after which he intends to retire from the Space Legion and sell his memoirs. His preferred method is to assign the toughest of assignments to the Omega Company ... a strategy that has thus far failed to do anything more than cement the reputation of Phule's Company as an elite body of troops. He also has been known to attempt to throw a monkey wrench into the smooth operation of the Omega Mob by complying with the letter of the regulations. One example of this is Blitzkrieg's responding to Phule's request that a chaplain be assigned to his company by sending him a chaplain from The Church of The King ‚Äî whose saviour is a Twentieth Century musician. Colonel Battleaxe The officer who originally assigned Phule to the Omega Company and his immediate superior, Battleaxe fully expected that the tough duty would lead to his resignation. She was surprised but pleased when he instead turned them around and has since become his staunchest defender in the Space Legion, to the point of breaking off her first vacation in years to cross the galaxy and assist him against one of Blitzkrieg's schemes. She is aware that, should Phule be drummed out of the Legion, the resulting backlash from Phule-Proof Munitions (to which Phule is heir) would be disastrous to the Space Legion. She has recommended both Rembrandt and Armstrong for commands of their own. Flight Leftenant Qual The company's Zenobian contact. Though not a member of the unit, he is nevertheless indebted to Phule, whom he met during the first book, with pulling him out of disrepute due to his mistaking a ceremonial vase for a waste receptacle at a prominent reception. This incident led to his placement on an exploration team which crash landed upon the swamp planet, Haskins, whereupon their outfit was discovered and fired upon by Do- Wop of the Omega Company out of ignorance. His species resemble miniature allosaurs. Due to a malfunction of his universal translator, Qual habitually refers to Willard Phule, aka Captain Jester, as \\"Captain Clown.\\" Rev When Captain Jester requested a chaplain for the Omega Company, General Blitzkrieg sent him the Reverend Jordan Ayres, of the Church of The King. He is somewhat pudgy with black, slicked back hair and an all too easily recognized face.

Manistique had eleven career wins, all of which came at racetracks in California. Background Bred and raced by Marshall Naify's 505 Farms, she was an exceptionally large filly who stood close to seventeen hands. Thoroughbred Times reported that she was a \\"high-strung mare, whose excitability has been her undoing in three disappointing efforts out of state.\\" Racing career Conditioned for racing by John Shirreffs, Manistique debuted in 1998, winning her first three races at Hollywood Park Racetrack by a combined thirty-one lengths. She then was shipped to Saratoga Race Course in the New York state where her volatility caused her problems and she ran third to Banshee Breeze in the Alabama Stakes. In 1999, she won six important stakes including the Grade I Vanity Invitational and Santa Margarita Invitational Handicaps. Her temperamental problems and dislike of travel would be evident when, after a brilliant campaign in California, she finished last in the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream Park in Florida then returned to Hollywood Park where soon after she won her second straight Bayakoa Handicap by three lengths. In February 2000, the then five-year-old Manistique earned her third Grade I victory in the Santa Maria Handicap while carrying a career- high 125 pounds. It was to be her last race as she later injured herself during a workout and was retired. Broodmare Owner Marshall Naify died on April 19, 2000 and his estate sold Manistique to Aaron and Marie Jones who sent her to serve as a broodmare at Taylor Made Farm near Nicholasville, Kentucky. Manistique suffered an \\"Early Fetal Loss\\" of her first foal as a result of the Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome (MRLS) that plagued horse breeding farms in central Kentucky in 2001. She produced her first live foal in 2003 by Forestry. She has since foaled two by Storm Cat in 2004 and 2005. The latter, named Old Ninety Eight, is currently (2009) racing for Team Valor.

In 1929 the pan was used by Sir Malcolm Campbell, who unsuccessfully attempted to break the land speed record in his Napier-Campbell Blue Bird. Andy Green visited the pan during 2008, while investigating surfaces for use by Bloodhound SSC. Location This region contains very little vegetation, primarily very low shrubs and yellow grass among a rocky desert kind of landscape. During the seasons many birds flock to the pans, when they contain water, after some rainfall. Temperature above 40 ¬∞C is not uncommon. The surface is completely flat, claimed to be a dried-up lake estimated long and wide. A large section of the pan's surface is moderately covered with grass and rocks. It can be reached by driving about south from Kenhardt on the way to Cape Town. Former Agricultural Contours Google Earth has revealed extensive former agricultural contouring on this pan, suggesting a much once wetter climate.https://www.google.com/maps/@-30.0226843,21.0973055,911m/data=!3m1!1e3 This region was included in a Sciforums article by Walter Wagner regarding such former agriculture in an article entitled Ancient Dikes, Dams and Reservoirs of the Kalahari Region.http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ancient- dikes-dams-and-reservoirs-of-the-kalahari-region.159050/#post-3443117 Another article suggested it was connected to a similar region further north.http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ancient-namibian-freeway-overlays- ancient-agriculture-system.158967/#post-3440178 Landspeed records Malcolm Campbell In 1929 the pan was used by Sir Malcolm Campbell, attempting to raise the land speed record in his Napier-Campbell Blue Bird. The trip to the Bushmanland was not an easy one for Campbell. First he lost his briefcase with important papers in it. Secondly he survived when his aeroplane crashed in a tree near Calvinia. A threatening assignment was facing the people preparing the track. Willem Louw was in charge sweeping the pan. Puffadders and scorpions were very common in the area and the temperature could rise to 42 ¬∞C in the shade during the summer. Campbell and his crew underestimated the Verneukpan's tricks. The track, starting from a hill on the outskirts and striking into the heart of the pan was supposed to be long. It was spread out directly west-east and looked straight into the rising sun. The dust devils were a major hazard for Campbell. Mirages created phantom trees and ghostly men on stilts. Extremely sharp stones were spread all over the pan's surface. When these stones were removed, holes were left. The day of the Flash in the Pan was postponed time after time. A tortoise on the track, was named Blue Bird II. During the setbacks, the targeted record of was pushed to . Campbell wanted to reach , but his mean speed for the measured mile was . He failed to break the record when the coarse surface damaged his tyres. He had vanquished the speed record he had come to South Africa for, but it was 6 weeks too late. With only one set of tyres left, he took on the record, reaching . The Bluebird started her last run on 25 January 1929, at 05:00, under the moon and the early light. She flashed like a silver bullet along the white line that stretched beyond sight. He set two records that day. The first for the , reaching . Secondly for the , reaching . He promised to come back in his Springbok. He eventually never did. In a new Bluebird designed by Reid Railton, Campbell broke the land speed record four more times at Daytona. In 1935 Campbell did exceed reaching at Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, becoming the first man to exceed on land. The track that he compacted on the pan is still visible today. Vic Proctor During 1952 Vic Proctor tried to set the world motorcycle record on his Vincent Black Lightning, but eventually crashed at around . Later that year he set the Flying Mile record, but not at Verneukpan. Bloodhound SSC Andy Green also visited the pan during 2008, as he needed to check every possible surface to rank them all for use by Bloodhound SSC. The pan is well known for its high-quality alkali playa surface, which would be perfect for Bloodhound. Unfortunately it is also covered by a huge number of stones (klippe). While the pan meets all the other requirements for a land speed record track, removing the stones over the huge area needed would require a vast amount of manual work. Accidents This is also the place where Johan Jacobs ‚Äì South African land speed record holder and former fighter pilot ‚Äì died on 27 June 2006. His jet car, Edge, went out of control and flipped while travelling at approximately . This happened during a practice run for an attempt to break the 24-second world record for the standing mile over . Activities Some campers on Verneukpan. The pan is undoubtedly the ultimate kiting destination in South Africa. The widespread open spaces offer ideal opportunities for parasailing. The pan is also used by kite-surfers, an extreme sport using wind buggies. These are bicycle-like vehicles with a sail attached to them. With wind buggies speeds of up to can be reached. There are also many viewpoints that are ideal for birdwatching.. South African pop singer Karlien van Jaarsveld recorded the music video for 'Hande' on the fields.

Up until 1960s capitalist class was studied mostly within the national context. Study from 1974 titled Global Reach: The Power of the Multinational Corporation by Ronald E. Muller and Richard Barnet started the discussion about multinational corporations and to what authors referred as ‚Äúinternational corporate elite.‚ÄùRobinson, William I. and Sprague, Jeb. (2018) . \\"The Transnational Capitalist Class.\\" In Mark Juergensmeyer, Manfred Steger, Saskia Sassen, and Victor Faesse, Eds., The Oxford Handbook of Global Studies (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press), P. 309-327. According to Professor William I. Robinson it is \\"that segment of the world bourgeoisie that represents transnational capital\\".Robinson, William I. (2003) Transnational Conflicts: Central America, Social Change and Globalization. Verso Books, p. 39. It is characteristically cosmopolitan and often unconstrained by national boundaries. The transnational capitalist class is expressed as a global ruling class and essential players of global capitalism by William I. Robinson and Jerry Harris. Different factions within this class exist. Harris, for example, identifies statist-factions of the TCC in Russia, China, and the Persian Gulf. Various studies have examined the role of the TCC in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. Professor Leslie Sklair argues that the transnational capitalist class is made up of four fractions which he identifies as corporate, state, technical and consumerist. The four fractions stated by Professor Leslie Sklair, bring together transnational corporations (TNC), globalizing bureaucrats, globalizing professionals and merchants as well as the media as members of the TCC. Also according to Sklair's book Sociology of the Global System, the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows the existence of the TCC as the corporate fraction and the state fraction gather in Davos, Switzerland. The theory of the Transnational Capitalist Class has two main principles:Sklair, Leslie (May 2002). \\"Democracy and the Transnational Capitalist Class.\\" The Annals, 581(1): 144-157, American Academy of Political and Social Science. # The transnational capitalist class collaborate to benefit their own interests (powerful lobbyists and super PACs); # Nation states have less control over transnational capitalist corporations aiding in globalization. \\"Davos Man\\" is a neologism referring to the global elite of wealthy (predominantly) men, whose members view themselves as completely \\"international\\" and who despise the people of their own country, being loyal only to global capital itself. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, who is credited with inventing the phrase \\"Davos Man\\",Timothy Garton Ash. Davos man's death wish , The Guardian, 3 February 2005 they are people who \\"have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the √©lite's global operations\\". In his 2004 article \\"Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite\\", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.Samuel Huntington. \\"Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite\\" , The National Interest, Spring 2004 Ian Richardson sees Bilderberg group as the transnational power elite, \\"an integral, and to some extent critical, part of the existing system of global governance\\", that is \\"not acting in the interests of the whole\\".

It was originally tabled in October 2006 in the House of Commons of Canada as Bill C-377 of the 39th Parliament by Jack Layton, then the leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP). It passed third reading by a vote of 148 to 116 with the support of caucuses of the Liberal Party of Canada, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and the NDP (the Conservative Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, voted against it). However, Bill C-377 died as it was still before the Senate when Parliament was dissolved for the 2008 Canadian federal election. On February 10, 2009 Bruce Hyer, then the New Democrat Deputy Environment Critic and MP for Thunder Bay-Superior North, seconded by Layton, reintroduced it in the 40th Parliament as Bill C-311. It passed 2nd Reading on April 1, 2009 by a vote of 141 to 128, and was sent to the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development. On October 21, 2009, the House voted 169 to 93 to allow the Committee more time to study the Bill, as the sixty sitting days permitted for its consideration under Standing Order 97.1(1) of the House of Commons had expired. Passage of the Climate Change Accountability Act was therefore effectively delayed until 2010, meaning it would not influence the government in negotiations at the UN COP15 global climate change treaty negotiations held in December 2009 in Copenhagen. On December 10, 2009, the committee report on Bill C-311 was presented to the House, without amendment to the Bill. The December 30, 2009 prorogation of the House did not affect the Bill, as Private Member's Bills are reinstated at the stage last completed, and Bill C-311 had not been considered at Report Stage at prorogation. When Parliament resumed, C-311 was concurred in at Report Stage on April 14, 2010 by vote 155 to 137. The bill was passed by the House of Commons at 3rd Reading on May 5, 2010 with 149 votes for and 136 votes against. It received 1st Reading in the Senate on May 6, 2010 before being defeated at 2nd Reading on November 16, 2010 by a vote of 43 to 32. The bill was re-introduced as Bill C-224 on June 15, 2011 by current NDP Environment Critic and MP for Halifax, Megan Leslie. The bill was seconded by Deputy Environment Critic Laurin Liu.  Provisions  The Bill requires that the Canadian federal government set regulations to attain a medium-term target to bring greenhouse gas emissions 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, and a long-term target to bring emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. According to the summary, the purpose of this bill is: > \\"to ensure that Canada meets its global climate change obligations under the > United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by committing to a > long-term target to reduce Canadian greenhouse gas emissions to a level that > is 80% below the 1990 level by the year 2050, and by establishing interim > targets for the period 2015 to 2045. It creates an obligation on the > Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development to review > proposed measures to meet the targets and submit a report to Parliament. It > also sets out the duties of the National Round Table on the Environment and > the Economy.\\"Parliament of Canada The Climate Change Accountability Act is based on the Case for Deep Reductions report by the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and on guidelines set by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These are the same emissions targets adopted by the European Union and announced as objectives of U.S. President Obama's New Energy For America strategy. The Bill is noteworthy in that it was the first legislation in the world to pass a democratically elected parliament which mandated hard emissions reductions for the post-Kyoto Protocol period (after 2012).

Career Fortuna D√ºsseldorf Meyer started his career at Wersten 04 and TuRU D√ºsseldorf before joining Fortuna D√ºsseldorf in 1960. He played in the 1961‚Äì62 DFB-Pokal final with the club, losing 2‚Äì1 to 1. FC N√ºrnberg. In 1966, he helped Fortuna reach the Bundesliga for the first time, scoring twice in a 5‚Äì1 victory against Kickers Offenbach in the Aufstiegsrunde, securing the club's promotion on goal average. He appeared 25 times and scored eight goals during the following season in the Bundesliga, but could not prevent Fortuna from being relegated at the end of the campaign. Meyer was not offered a new contract following Fortuna's relegation, and was free to look for a new club. With a total of 119 goals in 174 league games between 1960 and 1967, he is the club's record goalscorer. Borussia M√∂nchengladbach After initially agreeing terms with MSV Duisburg, Meyer opted to sign for Borussia M√∂nchengladbach after being persuaded to join the club by G√ºnter Netzer, who showed up at the car workshop that Meyer worked at. He debuted on 19 August 1967 against Schalke 04, scoring a hat trick in a 4‚Äì3 away win, and went on to score 19 goals for the club in the first half of the 1967‚Äì68 Bundesliga season. He was subsequently selected by Helmut Sch√∂n to play for West Germany in their decisive Euro 1968 qualification match against Albania in Tirana. West Germany failed to qualify after drawing the match 0‚Äì0, and the game became known as the \\"Disgrace of Tirana\\". Injury and retirement In January 1968, during a training match played in Duisburg, Meyer broke his tibia and fibula following a collision with his own goalkeeper Volker Danner. Meyer never fully recovered from the injury, and required a second operation after returning to training too soon after the incident. He made a brief comeback in August 1969, starting in a league match against Bayern Munich, but was substituted at half-time, and never made another appearance in the Bundesliga.

The current line-up is Jeremy Thoms (lead vocals/guitar/keyboards), Steve Fraser (guitar/backing vocals), Phil Biggs (guitar/backing vocals), Neil Baldwin (bass), and David Mack (drums and percussion). History Originally based on a loose concept of forging late 1970s New York, with late 1970s Manchester, The Cathode Ray started life in 2006, initially as a song-writing collaboration and ‚Äúa bit of fun‚Äù between Jeremy Thoms and his friend ex-Josef K frontman Paul Haig. The songs written were swift to adopt their own unique stamp and personality, so a band was needed to flesh them out. Adding 1960s garage, soundtracks, glam rock, northern soul, disco and psyche to the palette, recording sessions ensued, with ex-Bluebells and TV21 bassist Neil Baldwin, plus drummer/percussionist David Mack completing the line-up. A one- off double A‚Äìsided single entitled \\"What‚Äôs It All About?\\" / \\"Mind\\" was released in late 2006 on Pronoia Records. The single was awarded 2006 Single Of The Year by Sunday Mail columnist Billy Sloan. A second single, \\"Slipping Away\\", was released in April 2009 through Re-Action Recordings. Journalist Paul Lester proclaimed it a hit single in The Guardian. A revised version (with Thoms on lead vocals) appears on the band‚Äôs 2012 debut album. Just prior to the release of that single, Paul Haig quit the project, not wishing to be involved with another band. With Thoms assuming all lead vocal and song- writing duties, former Scars/Mike Scott accomplice Steve Fraser joined on lead guitar and backing vocals in 2009. Writing and recording sessions for their debut album continued with the new line-up throughout 2010 ‚Äì 2011 at Gold Star Studios in Fife. 2010 also saw The Cathode Ray making their live debut with shows in Edinburgh and Glasgow. They also made an appearance at the Wickerman Festival in 2012. Their debut album, The Cathode Ray, was finally released in April 2012, through Stereogram Recordings. The single ‚ÄúDispersal‚Äù was Track Of The Month in April 2012 on the Janice Forsyth Show on BBC Radio Scotland. Three tracks, \\"Train\\", \\"Around\\" and \\"Dispersal\\" were lifted from the album as singles. The Cathode Ray released their second album entitled Infinite Variety on Stereogram Recordings in April 2015, accompanied by the singles \\"Resist\\", \\"Buck The Trend\\" and \\"This Force Of Nature\\". The Cathode Ray returned in April 2018, after a three-year recording hiatus, with a single \\"Another World\\". Their third album Heightened Senses was released on Stereogram Recordings in November 2019, preceded by the title track as a single in September 2019. Heightened Senses marked the recording debut of guitarist Phil Biggs with the band, plus production assistance, cover art and video direction from Alex Thoms, the son of lead singer Jeremy Thoms.

The New Castle Methodist Episcopal Church was designed by J. King in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture and built in 1868 by Edward Dauchey, while the parsonage, designed in the Victorian style of architecture, was built in 1871. Today the church is known as the United Methodist Church of Mt. Kisco.United Methodist Church of Mt. Kisco On November 4, 1982, both the church building and the parsonage were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a single filing. Note: This includes and Accompanying eight photographs Church Built in 1868 by Edward Dauchey, and designed by J. King in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture, the church building is located at 300 East Main Street. Its Carpenter Gothic features include a steep sloping roof, a board and batten front facade, many lancet windows, a lancet covered front entrance in a side belfry, all of which are typical of such churches. Unlike most of them, it also features a second smaller tower on the other front corner, steeples on each of the two towers, a total of 3 lancet covered entrances on its front facade: one in each tower and one in the center. Its slate roof is also unusual for such churches. Additions to the church building are the 1938 Halstead Memorial Hall on the rear and the 1958 one-story Education Building on one side. Although the additions are not Carpenter Gothic in style, they were designed to complement rather than detract from the original church's style. Exterior changes to the 1868 church include installing aluminum siding of the rear and sides and replacement in 1980 of the larger steeple with one of similar design but 10 feet shorter. Interior changes made to provide space for a pipe organ and a loft for the choir. Parsonage Built in 1871 and located at 31 Smith Avenue next to the church, the parsonage is a 3-story irregularly-shaped Victorian-style house with some Carpenter Gothic features. The third floor consists of a mansard- like roofing system punctuated by side gables, each of which has a single window. In the 1960s many repairs were made to bring the house up to date.

He was born probably in Rome. He appears for the first time as cardinal in March 1102, when he exercised the legatine duties in Benevento. From 1106 until 1109 he is attested as governor of Benevento. He belonged to the sixteen cardinals who confirmed the treaty of Ponte Mammolo between Pope Paschal II and Emperor Henry V (April 1111). He participated in the Lateran council in the following year. He subscribed the papal bulls between March 8, 1114 and April 10, 1129. Papal vicar at Rome, 1117‚Äì20. He participated in the papal election, 1118, in which pope Gelasius II was elected. In March 1119 he presided over the ratification by the Roman clergy of the election of Pope Callixtus II, made in Cluny by few cardinals present at the deathbed of Gelasius II. He served as legate of Callixtus II in Venice and Outremer. During the papal election, 1124 he unsuccessfully opposed the intervention of Roberto Frangipani, which resulted with the election of Pope Honorius II. He became dean of the College of Cardinals ca. 1126. In the papal election, 1130 he gave his vote to Pietro Pierleoni, who became antipope Anacletus II, and consecrated him to the episcopate on February 23, 1130. He subscribed the electoral decree of Anacletus on February 14, 1130, and the bulls issued by antipope on March 27 and April 24 of the same year.

They were rural entrepreneurs who leased the lands from aristocrats more attracted to the comforts of the city.Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, pp. 83-84 Many gabellotti were associated with, if not members of, the Mafia. Such alliances would allow them to protect themselves and their assets from bandits and cattle rustlers, as well as cut through much of the messy legalities left over from Sicily's transition from feudalism to capitalism in the early 19th century.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 132-33 The word is derived from the Sicilian word gabella, meaning a ‚Äútax or duty in the form of a required payment‚Äù. The gabelotto paid the landowner for the use of land, and rented out the use of the land to peasants or through a sub-lease to sotto-gabellotto. In practice, the gabellotto acted as an overseer and was the real power on the estate. He hired guards (campieri) to protect livestock, equipment and the property, and to control the peasants. The peasant would often be in debt to the gabellotto for the rent, tax and supplies and seeds for the planting season. The gabellotto eventually would overpower the landowner and by the mid-19th century would be the real power on the Sicilian countryside.Albini & McIllwain, Deconstructing Organized Crime, pp. 31-35 The gabellotto‚Äôs role extended well beyond the boundaries of the estate covering the security needs in areas out of control of the state in central and western Sicily with his guards. Over the course of the breakup of the feudal economy in the first half of the 19th century he established a power to intimidate society both upwards (the absentee landlords) and downwards (the peasants).Lupo, History of the Mafia, pp. 36-37 References * Albini, Joseph L. & Jeffrey Scott McIllwain (2012), Deconstructing Organized Crime: An Historical and Theoretical Study, Jefferson NC: McFarland, * Dickie, John (2004).

Such nouns were a rather small percentage of the declension, and often were proper names. Most masculine common nouns of this group, though not all, carried a male association in ancient times. Other nouns in this declension were feminine; there were no neuters. The gender of (particularly) a common noun was and remains a grammatical phenomenon, technically independent of the actual sex of the thing described. Ordinary nouns of the first declension most often end in -a in the nominative, and -ae in the genitive.

It preserves the historic Carillon Canal that was first built in the 1830s to facilitate travel on the Ottawa River. It is a prominent heritage site and recreation area, visited annually by 20,000 pleasure boaters and 30,000 people who use its riverside park. In addition to the original canal itself, other items of historical interest are: * the remains of lock No. 1, built between 1830 and 1833 * the superintendent's and toll collector's houses * the jetty of the second canal built between 1873 and 1882 * the Carillon Barracks, currently housing the Regional Argenteuil Museum. History Together with the Grenville Canal and the Chute-√†-Blondeau Canal, the Carillon Canal was built to navigate the Long Sault Rapids on the Ottawa River which stretched for from Carillon to Grenville. The impetus for these canals was the War of 1812. During this war, attacks along the Saint Lawrence River jeopardized the communication lines between Kingston and Montreal, the two main military positions of Upper and Lower Canada. The Ottawa River Canals and the Rideau Canal were thus designed as an alternative military supply route in the event of war with the Americans. Work began first on the Grenville Canal in 1818. In 1819, Captain Henry Vernet of the Royal Corps of Engineering arrived from Britain to lead the construction of the project. Hundreds of Irish immigrants and French Canadians excavated the canal under the direction of a hundred British soldiers. In 1833, the Grenville Canal was completed with an original length of and the entire network on the Ottawa River, including the 11 locks, was not fully completed until about 1843. The modern boat lock at Carillon The military requirements decided all aspects of the canal. The size of the locks were set to long, wide, and only deep at the thresholds. These dimensions, standards adopted for military use, were insufficient for any commercial use. Forestry had become the main economic activity in this region, and from 1867, local business people demanded that the government carry out improvements to the network because the original canal network had become outdated. In 1870, the Canals Commission recommended making the Ottawa River deeper between Lachine and Ottawa. Therefore, between 1873 and 1882, the Grenville and Carillon Canals were enlarged (the dam built upstream from the village of Carillon raised the level of the Ottawa River at Chute-√†-Blondeau, making the need for a canal and lock there no longer necessary). The canal was designated a National Historic Site in 1929. Further changes were made from 1959 to 1963 with the construction of the Carillon hydroelectric dam and a modern high lock at Carillon. This work substantially and irreversibly changed the canal network. The dam raised the water level by over at Carillon and over at Grenville. The new water level flooded the rapids of Long-Sault, transforming them into calm water.

It is a feature of the production function, and depends on the amounts of physical capital and labor already in use. Definition The marginal product of a factor of production is generally defined as the change in output resulting from a unit or infinitesimal change in the quantity of that factor used, holding all other input usages in the production process constant. The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (Y) per unit change in labor (L). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is: : \\\\frac {\\\\Delta Y} {\\\\Delta L}. In continuous terms, the MPL is the first derivative of the production function: : \\\\frac {\\\\partial Y} {\\\\partial L}.Perloff, J., Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus, Pearson 2008. p. 173. Graphically, the MPL is the slope of the production function. Examples Marginal product of labor table There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called increasing marginal returns. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not scaled properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as diminishing marginal returns. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as negative marginal returns. Marginal costs The marginal product of labor is directly related to costs of production. Costs are divided between fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, capital, or rK, where r is the rental cost of capital and K is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or wL, where w is the wage rate and L is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ‚àÜC/‚àÜQ. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases: ‚àÜC = ‚àÜVC = ‚àÜ(wL). Marginal cost is ‚àÜ(Lw)/‚àÜQ. Now, ‚àÜL/‚àÜQ is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor (‚àÜQ/‚àÜL). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor :MC = ‚àÜVC‚àï‚àÜQ; :‚àÜVC = w‚àÜL; :‚àÜL‚àï‚àÜQ (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1‚àïMPL. :Therefore MC = w ‚àï MPL Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, Microeconomics, 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001. Relation between MPL and APL The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or Q/L. The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, Intermediate Microeconomics, Thomson 2007, p. 215.Nicholson, W., Microeconomic Theory, 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185. The APL curve is shaped like an inverted ‚Äúu‚Äù. At low production levels the APL tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.Perloff, J., Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus, Pearson 2008, p. 176. At the point the APL reaches its maximum value APL equals the MPL.Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, Microeconomics with Calculus, 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253. Beyond this point the APL falls. During the early stages of production MPL is greater than APL. When the MPL is above the APL the APL will increase. Eventually the MPL reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MPL will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MPL is still above the APL and APL will continue to increase until MPL equals APL. When MPL is below APL, APL will decrease. Graphically, the APL curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL. The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MPL (which is the slope of the total product curve) equals the APL (the slope of the secant).Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory & Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008. Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as APL declines. The MPL curve intersects the APL curve from above at the maximum point of the APL curve. Thereafter, the MPL curve is below the APL curve. Diminishing marginal returns The falling MPL is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, \\"as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline.\\"Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, Managerial Economics, 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227. The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.Hal Varian, Microeconomic Analysis, 3rd ed. Norton 1992. Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MPL is zero.Perloff, J., Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus, Pearson 2008, p. 178. MPL, MRPL and profit maximization The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. The profit maximization issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage \\"up to the point where the input‚Äôs marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs\\". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRPL = MCL. The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or MœÄL = MRPL ‚àí MCLA firm maximizes profits where MœÄL = 0. The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor. That is, MRPL = ‚àÜTR/‚àÜL. MRPL is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRPL = MR √ó MPL. *Derivation: :MR = ‚àÜTR/‚àÜQ :MPL = ‚àÜQ/‚àÜL :MRPL = MR √ó MPL = (‚àÜTR/‚àÜQ) √ó (‚àÜQ/‚àÜL) = ‚àÜTR/‚àÜL Example *Assume that the production function is Q = 90L - L^2 * MC_L = 30 *Output price is $40 per unit. : MP_L = 90 - 2L : MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) : MRP_L = 3600 - 80L : MRP_L = MC_L (Profit Max Rule) : 3600 - 80L = 30 : 3570 = 80L : L = 44.625 :44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers. : Q = 90L - L^2 : Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 : Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 : Q = 2024.86 *Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2024.86 units, units might be given in thousands. Therefore quantity must not be discrete. *And the profit is : \\\\Pi = TR - TC : TC = MC_L*L (Actually marginal cost of labor is wages paid for each worker. Therefore we get total cost if we multiply it by the quantity of labor not by the quantity of products) : \\\\Pi = 40(2024.86) - 30(44.625) = 80994.4 - 1338.75 = 79655.65 * Some might be confused by the fact that L = 44.625 as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour. Marginal productivity ethics In the aftermath of the marginal revolution in economics, a number of economists including John Bates Clark and Thomas Nixon Carver sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the Chicago school such as Frank Knight (in The Ethics of Competition) and the Austrian School, such as Leland Yeager. However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by George Stigler. See also * Marginal product of capital Footnotes References *Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, Microeconomics with Calculus, 2nd ed.

Pyotr Chardynin, one of the pioneers of the film industry in the Russian Empire, directed over a hundred silent films during his career. Biography Pyotr Chardynin was born Pyotr Ivanovich Krasavtsev on 10 February 1873 in Simbirsk, Russian Empire (now Ulyanovsk, Russia). In 1890 he was admitted to the Drama School of Moscow Philharmonic Society, where he studied under Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko from 1891. After graduating he adopted stage name of Chardynin and started both acting and directing career in provincial Russian theatres in Belgorod, Orekhovo-Zuevo, Uralsk, and Vologda. In 1908 Chardynin joined the troupe at Vvedensky Narodny Dom in Moscow and, as a part of it, started his film acting career in A 16th Century Russian Wedding and Song About the Merchant Kalashnikov. In 1909 Chardynin debuted as a director with The Power of Darkness and soon become the principal director for Aleksandr Khanzhonkov's film company. In 1916, however, facing the serious competition from Yevgeni Bauer, Chardynin left the Khanzhonkov and, together with Vera Kholodnaya and several other leading actors joined Dmitriy Kharitonov's studio in Odessa. There Chardynin made several successful films including Molchi, grust... molchi. In 1920‚Äì1923 Chardynin lived and worked in Italy, France, Germany, and Latvia. In 1923 he returned to USSR to work at Odessa Film Studio, where he directed several costume dramas and epics about the history of Ukraine. During the early 1930s Chardynin was banned from directing by Soviet authorities and died in 1934 from the liver cancer.

Arrival is influenced by K-pop melodies, which has heavy focuses on hip hop, R&B;, and dance-pop. A majority of the EP was produced and recorded in South Korea in March 2008, and the EP is also produced by several famous Korean producers, such as Kim Kibom. The music video for the EP's first promotional single, \\"Arrival\\", was also filmed in South Korea, directed by Chun Hyuk-jin, the same director who directed some music videos for SM Entertainment artists. Recording and promotion The EP was recorded in South Korea under the supervision of Doremi Media, Top Combine's management in Korea. Kim Kibom, the producer of the title single \\"Arrival,\\" produced the song \\"especially for the group.\\" Influenced by modern K-pop, the single is produced with elements of hip hop, rock, and contemporary dance-pop. Vocally, the single incorporates harmonization and rap, arguably similar to SM Entertainment's SMP genre. The side tracks of the album, such as \\"Cotton Candy\\", \\"Next Stop, Forever,\\" etc. are less concentrated on hip hop, but they are portrayed as a faction of bubblegum pop. \\"Cotton Candy\\" was also composed and written by Top Combine member, Mars Ma. Top Combine noted that the EP was not only experimental, but also very enjoyable to record. The EP includes elements of music style that Mainland Chinese boy bands have not experimented in the past, and the group was eager to test out the new style. As soon as the album was released on October 19, the group went on a nationwide tour to promote the album, appearing in many variety programs and music programs that are broadcast on national television. Their appearance on Hunan TV's Happy Camp (Âø´‰πêÂ§ßÊú¨Ëê•) snatched an overwhelmingly high rating of 2.14, making the variety show to achieve the highest ratings of China for the month.

The line was constructed in order to connect already existing lines into a continuous east-west route parallel to the main Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis route Krak√≥w - Lw√≥w, which would be less exposed to attacks in a war with the Russian Empire. The railway was also supposed to activate underdeveloped mountainous areas of Galicia.

Meteorological history An area of disturbed weather developed northwest of Guam on September 10 and moved northwestward, slowly increasing in organisation. The Japan Meteorological Agency began monitoring the system as a tropical depression the next day. The depression continued to organise and strengthen, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on it during the afternoon of September 12, and began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 12W an hour later. The JMA followed suit early on September 13 and initiated advisories on the system; PAGASA named the system Falcon shortly after. The depression continued to intensify, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Nari later that morning. The storm then underwent rapid intensification that afternoon and evening, strengthening from a tropical depression to a typhoon in just 18 hours. The JMA upgraded Nari to a severe tropical storm late that afternoon, and by late that evening, Nari was upgraded to a typhoon. Nari reached its peak on September 14, and began weakening soon afterwards. It turned extratropical right after landfall in South Korea at tropical storm strength. Preparations Okinawa Enhanced Infra-red satellite image of Typhoon Nari near Okinawa on September 14 On September 14, Japan Airlines cancelled 14 flights in and out of Okinawa, affecting an estimated 5,300 people. All Nippon Airways cancelled 54 flights, Ryukyu Air Commuter cancelled 24, Skymark cancelled two, and Japan Airlines cancelled an additional 16 flights the next day. An estimated 21,000 passengers cancelled their flights arrangements due to Nari. United States Marine bases located in Okinawa were placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness-3 as Nari approached the islands on September 15\\\\. Aircraft and important equipment were secured to prevent damage to them. Several of the more important aircraft were transported to other locations throughout the Pacific. Working parties were scrambled to quickly assess and repair damage following the typhoon. About 30 marine soldiers were placed on \\"Typhoon Watch\\". They were to ride out the storm at the Foster headquarters building until Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness-1 had been sounded. At that time, they were to survey the area for signs of damage. South Korea At least 300 flights in and out of South Korea were cancelled due to Typhoon Nari. About 130 of the cancelled flights were from Jeju Island. An additional 3,000 ferries were also cancelled from the island. Several ports along the southern coast of South Korea were shut down due to the storm. Typhoon warnings were issued for most of the southern regions of the country. Impact Japan Estimated rainfall totals from Typhoons Nari and Wipha from September 13-20 Winds were recorded up to 101 km/h (63 mph) in the United States Marine base. Damage at the base was primarily limited to trees. The storm passed directly over Kumejima Island, producing a record 226 km/h (140.5 mph) wind gust on the island. A pressure of 948.4 hPa (mbar) was recorded as the eye passed over. This record was eclipsed less than two weeks later by Typhoon Wipha which produced a wind gust of 252 km/h (156.6 mph). Total precipitation in Okinawa was estimated to have reached 120 mm (6 in), with rainfall rates peaking at 45.5 mm (1.8 in) per hour. At least 4,500 residences were left without power throughout all the islands, most of which were on Kumejima. In Naha City, a wall collapsed due to the rain but caused no injuries. Cars were reportedly flipped over in Kumejima Town where the worst damage was dealt. Numerous buildings lost their windows and numerous trees were knocked down. The outer bands of Nari trigged flooding which killed three people and injured three others in Kyushu. Fourteen homes were destroyed, 22 were damaged, and 117 others were affected. A total of 1,247 hectares of farmland was either damaged or destroyed by the typhoon. At the height of the storm, 4,800 households were without power and 3,700 were without water. Damages from both prefectures amounted to ¬•31.4 billion ($323 million USD). South Korea Throughout the country, a total of 479 structures were damaged or destroyed, displacing 948 people. The torrential rains submerged large areas of farmland and flooded roadways. The hardest hit area was Jeju Island, where rainfall amounted to a record 590 mm (23.2 in). At least 12 people were killed on the island and damages amounted to ‚Ç©28 billion ($19.2 million USD). In all, 20 people were killed and damages amounted to ‚Ç©65.2 billion (US$70 million). Aftermath Following Typhoon Nari, Jeju Island was declared a national disaster area by the South Korean government. Residents who lost 30 percent or more of their property were entitled to a nine-month extension to their tax deadlines. The government reported that they would cover about 90 percent of the costs for rehabilitation on the island.

History The history of Kingfisher Sky started in 2001, after drummer Ivar de Graaf left Within Temptation, to pursue his own musical interests, and founded Jambone, with the idea to cover classic rock bands. The band featured Edo Van Der Kolk on lead guitar and Michiel Parqui on bass guitar. Edo had already known Ivar for fifteen years and the trio had been playing together since high school, experimenting with various styles of music. They found a lead vocalist in the classically trained singer Judith Rijnveld and, when Zelda Weski joined as backing vocalist, the line-up was completed. Too widespread are the musical influences of Ivar and together with Judith as the songwriter they explored a way to combine their compositions into songs that didn't bound themselves to a specified genre or weren't tied to a particular single style, with the two female voices giving soul and melody to contrast the heavy groove-oriented music. The band released a 5-track demo in January 2002, but unfortunately Michiel and Zelda left in October 2003 and Edo took a hiatus. One year later, Ivar decided to change the name to Kingfisher Sky and the duo started recording songs in their home studio in 2005. At an early stage, Eric Hoogendoorn was chosen as the permanent bassist and guitarist Daan Janzing, who was introduced by Ruud Jollie (Within Temptation), was recruited next. George van Olffen on keyboards followed soon after. This resulted in a demo containing 11 tracks in October 2006 and a record deal with Suburban Records was signed in the same year. Edo appeared on the demo as a guest musician, playing a guitar solo on the demo version of \\"Through My Eyes\\", before returning full-time in 2007, completing the band for the time being. In June 2007 they recorded their first album, produced by Jochem Jacobs (Textures) and Bouke Visser (Split Second Sound), in various studios under the inspiring leadership of the producer duo. Hallway of Dreams was released in October of the same year and received with great reviews and, since then, the band has completed numerous shows as support for related bands such as Delain and Epica with a successful headline tour throughout the Netherlands followed. Within the scope of a special show in their hometown, Kingfisher Sky was joined by classical cellist Maaike Peterse, who played along on \\"Big Fish\\". As this cooperation proved to be very successful, Maaike soon became the seventh band member. In March 2008, Laser's Edge Records released Hallway of Dreams in the United States (Riverside, Zero Hour). Japan followed in 2008 (Disk Union). It was also released on Vinyl by Tonefloat Records (Porcupine Tree, Roger Waters). Meanwhile, Hallway of Dreams is also available in United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany. George van Olffen left the band in July 2009 to pursue other musical interests. With Ren√© Merkelbach the band found a new keyboardist, until David Gutierrez Rojas joined in November 2010. In April 2010, the band announced that guitarist Daan Janzing was about to leave Kingfisher Sky in order to fully concentrate on his other band My Favorite Scar. The new guitarist is Chris Henny. Kingfisher Sky released their second album 'Skin of The Earth' on 23 September 2010. In May 2014 Eric Hoogendoorn left Kingfisher Sky and he was replaced by Nick Verschoor. After a successful crowdfunding campaign the money was raised to start recording their third album, Arms of Morpheus, which was released in October 2014. The album features Kristoffer Gildenl√∂w on bass on several tracks. In the beginning of 2016, keyboardplayer David Guiterrez Rojaz left the band to pursue other interests. He was replaced with Erik van Ittersum (Ayreon). A few months later, guitarist Chris Henny also parted ways with the band, that has continued as a six piece ever since. Style Ivar's progressive rock and traditional folk music influences collided with Judith's classical conservatory background, and also her preference for soul. Combined with their mutual love for bands and artists, like Aretha Franklin, Porcupine Tree, Jethro Tull, Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Cecilia Bartoli, Mother's Finest, King's X, Skunk Anansie, Anouk, Heart, Clannad, Mike Oldfield and Pink Floyd, new songs were written.

Their music is identified as glam or sleaze metal, with their influences being M√∂tley Cr√ºe, AC/DC, Skid Row, Judas Priest, Poison, and Guns N' Roses. Dirty Penny has currently released two albums, Take it Sleezy (2007), and Young & Reckless, released on September 17, 2009.  History  Dirty Penny formed in Santa Cruz, California. They gained popularity by winning a \\"Battle of the Bands\\" run by jpotmusic.com. Their music has been described as \\"glittery-glam\\", \\"sex-fueled\\", and \\"leather-encased\\". It is reminiscent of 1980s glam metal made popular by M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Poison, Guns N' Roses, RATT, and Skid Row. Dirty Penny was originally a Poison cover band, ironically called Antidote. They later had to drop Antidote due to a Dutch band of the same name. Dirty Penny has since played at all three Rocklahoma Festivals. Bassist Tyno Vincent said this about the band: > \\"We were into old-school punk, like The Misfits, when we first got into > music, then got into glam as a fuck-you to our hometown...But punk's got a > lot of rules, and that's not very punk.

Young & Reckless was issued on September 17, 2009. For this album, Dirty Penny altered their look from their original \\"glittery-glam\\" to a more modern, less- showy getup. Fans tend to argue their music has not changed, despite their outward appearance. In mid-2009, Dirty Penny embarked on the aforementioned headlining tour with Vains of Jenna. On this tour, Dirty Penny had a run-in with a woman who they deemed the \\"crazy bitch\\". She followed the band and asked for a free ride to Los Angeles, which they refused due to space restrictions. After they took off for LA, she followed them for a good while down the freeway. Something took over this woman, and she decided to ram Dirty Penny's van multiple times while driving. This incident resulted in their Young & Wrecked tour poster. On October 25, 2010, Dirty Penny's social sites posted that lead singer Binge Daniels has left the band on good terms. On February 14, 2011, Jonny, using his real name of Ian MacPherson, appeared with his sister and the band Wildstreet on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in a skit to have his hair permed. Ian referred to Wildstreet as 'his band'. Bassist \\"Tyno Vincent\\" (real name Tyler Molinaro) joined American Idol finalist, James Durbin's solo band for his tour in 2011/12.

The shell of this species is biconvex. The height of the shell is half or nearly half of the greatest diameter. The shell is solid, and obtusely angular at the periphery. The shell color is a brown-tinted whitish; the base is copiously dappled with oblong spots, and more or less spirally clouded with dull reddish brown. The upper surface has a broad reddish-brown band above the periphery. This band is often mottled, and fades out at its upper edge. There is a narrow dark spiral band bordering the suture below, fading on the two earlier whorls. The surface is slightly striate above, and on the first half of the base. The last half whorl is regularly latticed or malleate in a diamond pattern. The shell has 5 whorls; the first one is flattened. The last half-whorl is straightened out: it runs to the periphery and is then upturned. It has three long and one short groove behind the lip. The aperture of the shell is subhorizontal, rounded, and obstructed by eight folds. The peristome is white, very broadly expanded, reflexed and recurved, rather thick, and arcuate throughout. The parietal callus is translucent-white, and spreads broadly upon the last and preceding whorls. The parietal margin bears three lamellae: a small, triangular angle- lamella, a large, erect parietal lamella, the inner end of which curves behind the preceding tooth, and a smaller, straight infraparietal lamella near the middle of the parietal margin. The outer lip bears five folds: subequal, straight and rather large upper and lower palatal folds within the outer margin, a somewhat smaller columellar lamella below them, and two still smaller suprapalatal folds on the upper margin, the upper one of which is smaller and tuberculiform. The width of the adult shell varies from 39 to 45 mm, the height from 20‚Äì21 mm.

Anatomy  Drawing of anatomy of Anostoma depressum viewed from underside of spire with shell removed. K = kidney. Anatomy of Anostoma depressum was examined by Harold Heath in 1914.Heath H. 1914. The anatomy of two Brazilian land-shells, Anostoma depressum and Tomigerus clausus. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 65: 688-692, plate 31 [1913]. The kidney, placed between the pericardial and body walls on the anterior face of the last fold, presents the usual sac-like appearance. Evidently the reno-pericardial opening is minute. The ureter, likewise, is difficult to trace throughout a portion of its course. Its external opening is immediately behind that of the alimentary canal, and from this point is readily followed to the region of the pericardium, where it decreases in caliber and passes into a network of blood vessels. It appears that the kidney is in contact, along its inner face, with a slender sack or tube with which the ureter communicates. There are no special features of the digestive system of Anostoma depressum. Drawing of reproductive system of Anostoma depressum viewed from apex of spire. ag. - accessory glands f - flagellum g - gonad r - seminal receptacle. Drawing of digestive tract of Anostoma depressum viewed from apex of spire. The description of the reproductive system of Ringicella ringens as described by Fischer (1869) applies in all essential details to Anostoma depressum with the exception of a penis retractor muscle attached to the vas deferens. In Anostoma depressum the external reproductive pore, located on the right side of the head, leads into a small atrium with which the penis, hermaphroditic duct, and seminal receptacle attach. The first named is a heavy, muscular organ, accompanied by the usual slender vas deferens, their union being effected at some distance from the distal end of the penis, which thus forms a flagellum. The penis and flagellum are both sharply defined and appear to be without muscular attachments, though bound to the body wall by delicate connective tissue strands. In the neighborhood of the outer opening, however, the penis sheath affords attachment for three or four slender muscle bands that Heath inclined to regard as penis retractors. The hermaphroditic duct, a highly glandular duct of comparatively even diameter, traverses the greater portion of the first coil of the body to enter the accessory glands. All of these structures are in a quiescent condition, and in size and configuration probably fall far short of their fully developed state in the sexually mature condition. The same is likewise true of the gonad. While the duct leading to it from the accessory glands is clearly apparent throughout the first part of its course, it gradually approaches the vanishing point, and cannot with certainty be traced to a gonad, which is accordingly drawn in its hypothetical position.  Feeding habits  Anostoma depressum is phytophagous feeding on vegetables and moss. References This article incorporates public domain text from references  Further reading  * Fischer. 1869.

He went to University College, Oxford (University of Oxford), where he was awarded a BA Honours (MA) degree in Modern History, the B.Litt., and the BCL. Rogers was private secretary to King from 1927 to 1929, then worked as a professor at Queen's University in Kingston.

The airport is named after former MP Norman McLeod Rogers (Kingston City 1935‚Äì1940), Minister of Labour and then National Defence in Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's cabinet. Rogers died in a plane crash on June 10, 1940 while flying from Ottawa to Toronto for a speaking engagement. History Norman Rogers Airport terminal On approach to runway 25 in a Cessna C-150 Before 1940, Kingston was served only by the Kingston Airfield, a grass strip just north of the city's downtown, which closed in 1942. In 1940, during the Second World War, an airfield was built to the west of Kingston to serve as a training station for the Royal Air Force's No. 31 Service Flying Training School (SFTS). The school provided advanced flight training in Battle and Harvard aircraft. In 1942 the school became part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). The BCATP's No. 14 Service Flying Training School moved to Kingston in 1944 and merged with the RAF school. No. 14 SFTS used Harvards, Yales and Ansons. A decommissioned yellow Harvard aircraft now stands on a pedestal near the airport entrance to commemorate the airport's wartime role. The airport was transferred to city control in 1972. The airport's runway outline displays the classic BCATP triangle pattern. The airport was built with six runways; however, this was reduced to three, as they were all parallel runways. One can still see where some parts of the parallel runways were from the air. Later, runway 01/19 was extended northwards to a length of to handle larger aircraft, and it is planned to be extended to (the prevailing wind is from the south off Lake Ontario). Runway 07/25 was extended northeastwards to a length of nearly , with no plans to extend it, due to the requirements for certified airports on runways over a certain length. The remaining runway, 12/30, was decommissioned in 2003 and converted to a taxiway. In 2018, the city began on extending the runway 01/19 from 5,000 ft to 6,001 ft. At the same time, the terminal was under construction with plans to expand the post security waiting area to accommodate larger aircraft such as a 737 or Q400. Construction is also underway at the departure and arrival areas to accommodate more passengers as well as a general renovation to make it more inviting and accessible. Air Canada indefinitely suspended its operations at Kingston Airport in June 2020 due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. On August 31, 2020 FlyGTA announced that they would begin regular passenger service between Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and Kingston Norman Rogers Airport. Flights from Toronto are offered Thursday to Sunday. Effective September 10, 2020. Airlines and Destinations Passenger Cargo Frequencies Kingston Airport services two frequencies: ATIS (135.550 MHz) and radio (122.500 MHz). There is also guidance for private aircraft needing fuel or parking on Kingston Flying Club Advisory (122.800 MHz). Kingston also has a non-directional beacon (NDB) that transmits \\"YGK\\" in morse code on the longwave radio frequency of 263 kHz.YGK Kingston - ourairports.com Operations Kingston is a mandatory frequency airport with an operating flight service station.

His highest rank was komusubi. Career Born in Kazuno, he was scouted by yokozuna Chiyonofuji after winning several children's sumo competitions in his native Akita Prefecture. At junior high school he was a rival of the future Wakanohana. He joined Chiyonofuji's Kokonoe stable and made his professional debut in May 1986. He made the sandanme division in November 1987 but then missed two tournaments and fell back to the lowest jonokuchi division. In July 1988 he won his first (and only) yusho or tournament championship in the jonidan division with a perfect 7-0 record. He reached the third highest makushita division a year later. While in the makushita division he performed the yumitori-shiki or bow- twirling ceremony that takes place at the end of every tournament day, from 1989 to 1990. He reached sekitori status in July 1990 upon promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division and in January 1991 made his debut in the makuuchi top division. He scored ten wins in his debut and was awarded the Fighting Spirit sansho or special prize. Tomoefuji seemed to have broken the jinx against performers of the yumitori-shiki ceremony having a successful career in sumo. In May 1992 he became the only sekitori in his stable, following the retirements of Hokutoumi and Takanofuji. Just a year earlier the stable had had two yokozuna, Hokutoumi and Chiyonofuji. Tomoefuji's subsequent career was blighted by injuries. He was involved in a training accident with Akebono shortly before the July 1992 tournament, which led to Akebono having to miss his debut tournament as ozeki. Tomoefuji made his debut in the sanyaku ranks at komusubi in that tournament, but had to pull out on the second day. He never managed to return to the rank. Restricted by an injury to his right knee, in September 1993 he was demoted back to the j≈´ry≈ç division after a poor 4-11 record. He missed two tournaments in 1994, falling to the bottom of the division, and in May 1995 he lost sekitori status altogether after falling back to makushita. He fought his last competitive match in March 1998. He was still listed on the banzuke ranking sheets in September but had fallen to sandanme 85, the lowest rank ever recorded by a former sanyaku wrestler, upon which he announced his retirement from sumo. He left the Sumo Association upon retiring. Fighting style Tomoefuji's favourite techniques were hidari- yotsu, (a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponents' mawashi) uwatenage, (overarm throw) and yorikiri (force out).

Overview Na Gruagaichean is a Munro reaching a height of 1,056 m (3,465 ft) which makes it the 74th highest in the Munro classification and is located at the Eastern end of the Mamores range. Views of the summit are clear from the village and from the B863 road from Glencoe to Kinlochleven except when the peak is shrouded in year-round mist. The mountain is one of the most accessible from the village due in part to its relatively close proximity and well defined path leading most of the way to the summit. On Saturday 8 June 2019, a group of seven walkers were on Na Gruagaichean during a lightning storm. One was killed and another injured. HM Coastguard helicopter, Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team and Scotland's Air Ambulance service all aided the rescue effort. Geography The mountain lies four kilometres north north-east of the village of Kinlochleven. The mountain is double topped at the intersection of three ridges, the South top being the higher and therefore the summit. The narrow North-East ridge connects to Binnein Mor via a minor top (1062m) and the narrow West-North-West ridge connects to Stob Coire a' Ch√†irn (981m) where a path ascends from Coire na B√†. The third South ridge leads to steep slopes overlooking Kinlochleven which provides excellent views of the village and the area. The mountain has a stony and, in places, craggy summit which gives great views of surrounding mountains such as Ben Nevis and Binnein Mor. Ascents Ascent up towards Na Gruagaichean usually starts at sea level in Kinlochleven, however it is possible to start by driving to Mamore Lodge and parking at the car park which saves 200m of ascent. From there it is usually climbed using the old stalkers path heading north away from the village before eventually turning east towards the summit. The mountain can also be climbed from Glen Nevis in conjunction with Binnein Beag and Binnein Mor as a ridge walk or a part as the challenging Ring of Steall ridge walk. The Mamores VK race, which starts in Kinlochleven, finishes at the top of Na Gruagaichean. Folk Tale told in Gaelic and English about Na Gruagaichean or The Maidens. Bha uair-eigin a‚Äô fuireachd an Callairt duin‚Äô-uasal a bha ‚Äôna shealgair fhiadh ro ainmeil‚Ä¶ There once lived in Callart a gentleman who was a very famous deer hunter. He had a greyhound the equal of which was not then to be found in Lochaber; but, like his master, he was growing old and losing his speed. One day in Autumn the gentleman, followed by his old greyhound, ascended the hill above Kinloch More to chase the deer. He reached the corries he used to frequent; but though he saw herd after herd of them and followed them all day long, he never got near enough to shoot an arrow or to slip the dog after them. At length, when the sun was slipping down in the west, he came upon a fine-full grown stag all by himself, and he slipped the dog in pursuit of him. The dog stretched away with all his might, and at first was gaining on the stag, but as soon as the stag laid his antlers down over his shoulders, and lifted his nostrils in the air, the dog began to fall behind, and soon lost sight of him altogether. Wearied and vexed, the gentleman sat down on a green hillock in a deep glen between two lofty mountains. He was not long there when two maidens of fairest form and mien stood before him, one of them holding a noble dog on a leash. The other was the first to speak, and she said: \\"You are tired, hunter of the deer,\\" said she, \\"and vexed because the old dog has allowed the big stag to escape.\\" \\"I am tired, indeed, and grieved, that the grey dog‚Äôs best days have passed,\\" answered the hunter. \\"Courage, and take this dog with you,\\" said the second maiden, \\"and there is not a four-hoofed creature on the face of the earth, from the little hare to the full-antlered stag, but he will catch, and bring to you.\\" \\"What is his name?\\" asked the hunter. She replied that it was Brodum. He took the leash out of her hand, and thanked her for the dog. He then bade farewell to herself and her companion, and went away home. As soon as he rose the next day, he brought everyone in the house out with him, and after turning his face towards the two mountains between which he had seen the maidens, he said: \\"Do you see yonder two mountains opposite you? From henceforth, remember that you are to call them the Maidens,\\" and that is what they are called to the present day. The dog followed the gentleman as long as he lived, Never was a leather strap placed on a better dog. Whatever he was asked to do he did, and no creature he was sent after but he caught. And there was no man living he would follow, or answer, save his master. When his master died he lost heart. He followed the funeral as far as the ravine between Callart and the next farm; but he stopped there and descended the ravine where he was seen entering a cave, out of which he never returned. His name is preserved in the names of these two places; for they are still called Brodum‚Äôs Ravine and Brodum‚Äôs Cave.Folk Tales and Fairy Lore in Gaelic and English Collected from Oral Tradition.

The village has a population of nearly 4,500, including a significant Druze community. With one public high school, one public elementary junior high school, and one private school (Al Ishraq), Qarnayel attracts students from neighboring villages. Qarnayel has a hospital (Al Jabal Hospital). Many grottoes are located in the steep pine-clad slopes above the town. The village is a major source of pine nuts due to stone pine (Pinus pinea) woods covering the area. Qarnayel also produces a variety of fruits and vegetables. Coal and iron were mined during the 19th century. Qarnayel is considered one of the most prominent summer villages in Lebanon, in the pre-war years a large number of residents of coastal villages intended to spend the summer in Qarnayel. After the war, Qarnayel attracted a large number of Gulf tourists who came to Qarnayel to spend the summer vacation, and many of them had owned residential apartments in the village.

At first they sampled rare Brazilian records from the 1960s and 1970s to make tracks. However, what started as two crate diggers making music for the fun of it soon developed into making a record with all of their favorite musicians. Sam and Ze's idea was to bring people from different worlds together through their shared inspiration and love of music.

The Soviet re-occupation of Latvia in 1944 refers to the military occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1944.Country Profiles: Latvia at UK Foreign Office During World War II Latvia was first occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 and then was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941‚Äì1944 after which it was re-occupied by the Soviet Union.  Battle of the Baltic  Army Group Centre was in tatters, and the northern edge of the Soviet assault threatened to trap Army Group North in a pocket in the Courland region. Panzers of Hyazinth Graf Strachwitz von Gross-Zauche und Camminetz had been sent back to the capital of Ostland, Riga and in ferocious defensive battles had halted the Soviet advance in late April 1944. Strachwitz had been needed elsewhere, and was soon back to acting as the Army Group's fire brigade. Strachwitz's Panzerverband was broken up in late July. By early August, the Soviets were again ready to attempt to cut off Army Group North from Army Group Centre. A massive Soviet assault sliced through the German lines and Army Group North was completely isolated from its neighbour. Strachwitz was trapped outside the pocket, and Panzerverband von Strachwitz was reformed, this time from elements of the 101st Panzer Brigade of panzer-ace Oberst Meinrad von Lauchert and the newly formed SS Panzer Brigade Gross under SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Gross. Inside the trapped pocket, the remaining panzers and StuG IIIs of the Hermann von Salza and the last of J√§hde's Tigers were formed into another Kampfgruppe to attack from the inside of the trap. On 19 August 1944, the assault, which had been dubbed Unternehmen Doppelkopf (Operation Doppelkopf) got underway. It was preceded by a bombardment by the cruiser Prinz Eugen's 203mm guns, which destroyed forty- eight T-34s assembling in the square at Tukums. Strachwitz and the Nordland remnants meet on the 21st, and contact was restored between the army groups. The 101.Panzerbrigade was now assigned to the army detachment \\"Narwa active at the Emaj√µgi River Front, bolstering the defenders' armour strength. Disaster had been averted, but the warning was clear. Army Group North was extremely vulnerable to being cut off. In 1944, the Red Army lifted the siege of Leningrad and re-conquered the Baltic area along with much of Ukraine and Belarus. However, some 200,000 German troops held out in Courland along with Latvian forces resisting Soviet reoccupation. They were besieged with their backs to the Baltic Sea. The Red Army mounted numerous offensives at massive losses but failed to take the Courland Pocket. Colonel-General Heinz Guderian, the Chief of the German General Staff insisted to Adolf Hitler that the troops in Courland should be evacuated by sea and used for the defence of the Third Reich; however, Hitler refused and ordered the German forces in Courland to hold out. He believed them necessary to protect German submarine bases along the Baltic coast. Soviet advances from 1 January 1945 to 7 May 1945 On January 15, 1945, Army Group Courland (Heeresgruppe Kurland) was formed under Colonel- General Dr. Lothar Rendulic. Until the end of the war, Army Group Courland (including divisions such as the Latvian Freiwiliger SS Legion) successfully defended the Latvian peninsula. It held out until May 8, 1945, when it surrendered under Colonel-General Carl Hilpert, the army group's last commander. He surrendered to Marshal Leonid Govorov, the commander of opposing Soviet forces on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group still consisted of some 31 divisions of varying strength. After May 9, 1945 approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began moving to Soviet prison camps in the East.

After World War II, as part of the goal to more fully integrate Baltic countries into the Soviet Union, mass deportations were concluded in the Baltic countries and the policy of encouraging Soviet immigration to Latvia continued. Background Note: Latvia at US Department of State On January 12, 1949 the Soviet Council of Ministers issued a decree \\"on the expulsion and deportation\\" from Latvia of \\"all kulaks and their families, the families of bandits and nationalists\\", and others. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940‚Äì1953. In addition, at least 75,000 were sent to Gulag. 10 percent of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps. Many soldiers evaded capture and joined the Latvian national partisans' resistance that waged unsuccessful guerilla warfare for several years. Wartime expediency evacuation from Ventspils, October 19, 1944. The precedent under international law established by the earlier-adopted Stimson Doctrine, as applied to the Baltics in U.S. Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles's declaration of July 23, 1940, defined the basis for non-recognition of the Soviet Union's forcible incorporation of Latvia.Latvia: Latvia By David J. Smith; Page 138 Despite Welles's statement, the Baltics soon reprised their centuries-long role as pawns in the conflicts of larger powers. After visiting Moscow in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden already advocated sacrificing the Baltics to secure Soviet cooperation in the war. The British ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, reported, \\"Mr. Eden cannot incur the danger of antagonizing Stalin, and the British War Cabinet have... agree[d] to negotiate a treaty with Stalin, which will recognize the 1940 frontiers of the Soviet Union.\\"Harriman, Averell & Abel, Elie. _Special Envoy to Churchill and Stalin 1941‚Äì1946_ , Random House, New York. 1974. p. 1135. By 1943 Roosevelt had also consigned the Baltics and Eastern Europe to Stalin. Meeting with Archbishop Spellman in New York on September 3, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated, \\"The European people will simply have to endure Russian domination, in the hope that in ten or twenty years they will be able to live well with the Russians.\\"Gannon, Robert. The Cardinal Spellman Story. Doubleday, New York. 1962. pp. 222‚Äì223 Meeting with Stalin in Tehran on December 1, Roosevelt \\"said that he fully realized the three Baltic Republics had in history and again more recently been part of Russia and jokingly added, that when the Soviet armies re-occupied these areas, he did not intend to go to war with the Soviet Union on this point.\\"Minutes of meeting, Bohlen, recording. _Foreign Relations of the United States, The Conferences of Cairo and Teheran, 1943_ , pp. 594‚Äì596 A month later, Roosevelt related to Otto von Habsburg that he had told the Russians they could take over and control Romania, Bulgaria, Bukovina, Eastern Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Finland.Bullitt, Orville. _For the President: Personal and Secret_. Houghton-Mifflin, Boston. 1972. p. 601. The future was sealed when on October 9, 1944 Churchill met with Stalin in Moscow and penciled out the post-war state of Europe. Churchill recounts: \\"At length I said, 'Might it not be thought rather cynical if it seemed that we had disposed of these issues, so fateful to millions of people, in such an offhand manner?

Early life William Temple Thomson Mason was born on July 24, 1782 at Raspberry Plain. \\"Temple\\", as his family called him, was Thomson Mason's third child and youngest son with his second wife Elizabeth Westwood Wallace. He was named after his father's English cousin, Sir William Temple. While Temple was still an infant, Temple's father died on February 26, 1785 and he was raised by his mother and older half-brothers. At the age of 19, Temple was sent to the College of William and Mary to obtain a gentleman's education. He spent two years at the college, graduating in 1803. Having reached the legal age of 21, Temple received a parcel of land in northern Loudoun County near Leesburg not far from Raspberry Plain, the house in which he grew up. According to Thomson Mason's last will and testament, recorded in Stafford County on September 26, 1784, he had bequeathed to Temple, his brother Westwood Thomson Mason and their half-brother, Abram Barnes Thomson Mason, several hundred acres of land along the Potomac River. On November 29, 1803, at the Loudoun County Courthouse in Leesburg, the three brothers filed a document which partitioned the land, with Temple receiving . Family and career Temple Mason built his home, Temple Hall, in the Federal style between 1810 and 1812. On June 16, 1812, Temple married Ann Eliza Carroll, daughter of Nicholas Maccubbin Carroll and Anne Jennings, in Annapolis, Maryland. Their first child, Temple Anna, was born at Temple Hall in 1813. Temple Mason not only oversaw the management of his prosperous Temple Hall farm, but also became involved in the community life of Leesburg. He served as a vestryman at St. James Episcopal Church and oversaw the polls during elections in Loudoun County. As a mark of his increased social standing in the community, Temple's estate became a hub of Leesburg society. On August 9, 1825 Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette during his grand tour of the United States and accompanied by President John Quincy Adams and former President James Monroe (who was then residing at his Oak Hill plantation in southern Loudoun County) visited Temple Hall. The three gentlemen witnessed the baptism of Mason's two youngest daughters; Lafayette became the godfather for Mary Carroll, and Adams and Monroe became as Maria Louisa's godfathers. Mason served one term in the Virginia House of Delegates, from 1830-1831, temporarily displacing veteran James McIlhaney.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Virginia State Library 1978) p. 356 Two of Temple Mason's sons and one of his daughters, Templeanna (1819-1849), died before the American Civil War. The same Leesburg, Virginia graveyard contains the remains of his sons Thomas Henry Carroll Mason (1822-1838) and Westwood Thomson Mason (1819-1854), the latter of whom died in Savannah, Georgia. Charles Carroll Mason (d. 1866) and Nicholas Carroll Mason (1810 - 1874) did not serve in either army in that conflict and are also buried in that cemetery; likewise William Temple Thomson Mason, Jr. (1800-1891), who would die and be buried in Tennessee. William T.T. Mason's daughter Eliza Mason Welch (1820-1899) married in Maryland in 1836 but spent most of her adult years and died in Iowa.

Prior to 1970, primary and secondary school teachers in Los Angeles were chiefly represented by a local of the American Federation of Teachers (called the Los Angeles Teachers Alliance, LATA) and the Associated Classroom Teachers of Los Angeles (ACT-LA) which was affiliated to the National Education Association.http://library.csun.edu/Collections/SCA/UAC/DFG/atola.html There were other smaller teachers unions active before 1970 that also merged into UTLA. Over a dozen different organizations merged to form UTLA. The first broad federation of Los Angeles School District teachers was the Affiliated Teacher Organizations of Los Angeles, formed between 1930 and 1932. UTLA is very active in the political sphere of California, especially since Proposition 13, which severely limited the amount that public schools can receive from property taxes. This shifted the burden to the state and increased the competition between state funded groups. The union has also advocated strongly against school voucher programs and attempts to break up the school district. 1989 strike On May 30, 1989, approximately 20,000 UTLA members went out on strike for higher pay and more administrative control. The strike lasted nine days starting on May 30, 1989. The months preceding the strike were highly contentious. Numerous negotiation tactics were deployed by both sides including teacher demonstrations, threats to withhold grades, threats to dock teacher pay and many hard fought court battles. Union demands included pay increases and better school conditions. Thousands of substitute teachers were mobilized in preparation for the strike, and teachers prepared by saving money to endure a long walk-out. Many of the city's 600 schools reportedly remained open but with lower attendance. The district reported that 8,642 teachers crossed picket lines, and public rhetoric by both sides was critical and intense. After negotiations, a settlement was reached and a three-year contract produced. Both sides claimed victory. Despite successful teacher pay raises obtained in the settlement, a massive economic recession in 1990 caused negotiations in 1991 to focus on preventing massive layoffs due to hundreds of millions in budget deficits. Salaries were cut to avoid layoffs, ameliorating the positive results of the 1989 strike. 2019 strike In August of 2018, under the leadership of progressive UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl, 98% of UTLA members authorized a strike over numerous disputes and a failure of months of contract negotiations. These included familiar issues such as salary increases, classroom size reduction and the need for more nurses and librarians. However, a new issue also predominated the discussions -- i.e., authority and control over the proliferation of charter schools. Thousands of UTLA teachers converge on downtown, Los Angeles, in a pre-strike rally December 15, 2018. At the time of the strike, one in five LAUSD students attended a charter school, siphoning an estimated $600 million dollars a year from the financially strapped school system, according to UTLA which called for a moratorium on charter school authorizations, an end to school privatization and robust funding for public education. Los Angeles had more charter school students than any other school district, in part because anti-union interests and billionaires, such as the Walton heirs to the Walmart fortune and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to elect a pro-charter majority on the seven-member school board. Fact-finding and mediation continued for several months, while teachers, counselors, parents and other community members rallied in downtown, Los Angeles, marching through an echoing 3rd Street tunnel, right up to the entrance of the Broad Museum, built by real estate magnate Eli Broad, who a few years earlier had conceived a plan to turn half of LAUSD into charter schools. The fact-finding report failed to resolve matters and UTLA stated that a strike would proceed on January 10, 2019. On January 14, 2019, despite torrential rain and an attempt by the district to enjoin the strike, 30,000 teachers walked out of class and onto the picket line in what was the first teacher's strike to rock Los Angeles in 30 years, not since 1989. (Jan. 14, 2019) UTLA teachers converge in the rain to rally in downtown, Los Angeles, on the 1st day of the strike The strike lasted six days. Schools remained open, with replacement teachers and administrative staff showing movies, filling in for the striking teachers, but school attendance was estimated to have dropped to less than half during the strike. (Jan. 17, 2019) Venice HS teachers and supporters walk the picket line in the rain Students at Venice High School created a buzz on Twitter when they danced in support of their striking teachers, issuing a Public Ed Dance Challenge to other students to learn their dance steps and join them on the picket line. Meanwhile, thousands of teachers clad in red union t-shirts, waving signs that read, \\"Save our Schools,\\" continued to attend rallies with community supporters around the city, including at City Hall and LAUSD headquarters. UTLA and the school district reached a deal on a new contract January 22, 2019, after an all-night negotiating session on the sixth day. The 2019-2022 UTLA contract includes a 6 percent teacher pay raise untethered to cuts in health benefits for new teachers; a reduction in class size by 4 students per class for grades four through 12 over the course of three years; a full-time librarian in each middle and high school; additional secondary school counselors to allow for more individual student counseling; plans to cut standardized testing by 50%; removal of a provision that had previously allowed the District to increase class sizes during times of economic hardship; teacher representation on charter co-location committees; and a \\"commitment to provide a full-time nurse in every school\\". The deal also includes the establishment of 30 community schools around the district, modeled after similar programs in Cincinnati and Austin that seek to provide students with social services and learning experiences in the arts. The deal does not contain any binding agreements on charter schools, but it does include a non-binding resolution that calls on the state to establish a cap on charter schools. (Jan. 22, 2019, Downtown, LA). UTLA teachers celebrate the end of their strike (Jan. 22, 2019. Downtown, LA.) With the strike over, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl and union officers thank teachers and community members for their support  Post-Strike Successes: Legislative and Electoral  Following the strike, UTLA, together with the California Teachers Association, successfully lobbied California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign two bills into law to hold charter schools more accountable and to give school districts the power to deny charter authorizations. Senate bill 126, previously vetoed by former Governor Jerry Brown, requires charter schools to conduct open meetings, produce requested records under the California Public Records Act and avoid conflicts of interest in contracts. Assembly bill 1505 empowers school districts to deny charter authorizations that might negatively impact the fiscal health of the district and to close charter schools that fail to adequately serve special education students. On the electoral front, in May, 2019, a few months after the strike, UTLA celebrated the overwhelming election of the union endorsed candidate, Jackie Goldberg, former LAUSD school board member and former assemblywoman, to represent District Five on the LAUSD school board, shifting the balance of power to support existing neighborhood schools.

Facts The case involved a former Shell employee, Charles T. Robinson, who claimed Shell Oil Company fired him from his sales job because he is black. While his race discrimination lawsuit was pending, Robinson applied for a job with another company who contacted Shell seeking a reference.

Transport It is connected by road to Mogok and its ruby mines, and via Mogok to Mandalay, and to Kyaukme which is on the Mandalay-Lashio railway line. Momeik is also linked to Myitkyina, capital of Kachin State via Mabein and Bhamo. There is an airport for domestic flights to Momeik. Whereas Mogok lies at an elevation of 4,000 ft, Momeik is just 800 ft above sea level and 28 miles to the north of Mogok. Sixty miles by road to the west of Mogok lie Twinnge Village and the town of Thabeikkyin on the Ayeyarwady River (Irrawaddy). There is now a direct road linking Twinnge with Momeik. History Momeik, part of the state of Hsenwi, was founded in 1238. Thirteen villages of the Mogok Stone Tract were given to Momeik in 1420 as a reward for helping Yunnan raid Chiang Mai. In 1465, Nang Han Lung, the daughter-in-law of the Saopha (Sawbwa in Burmese) of Momeik, sent ruby as separate tribute from Hsenwi and succeeded in keeping the former possessions of Hsenwi until 1484 when Mogok was ceded to the Burmese kings. It was however not until 1597 that the Saopha of Momeik was forced to exchange Mogok and Kyatpyin with Tagaung, and they were formally annexed by royal edict. Earlier in 1542, when the Shan ruler of Ava Thohanbwa (1527‚Äì1543) marched with the Saophas of Mohnyin, Hsipaw, Momeik, Mogaung, Bhamo and Yawnghwe to come to the aid of Prome against the Burmese, he was defeated by Bayinnaung. In 1544, Hkonmaing (1543-6), Saopha of Onbaung or Hsipaw and successor to Thohanbwa, attempted to regain Prome, with the help of Mohnyin, Momeik, Mon√®, Hsenwi, Bhamo and Yawnghwe, only to be defeated by King Tabinshwehti (1512‚Äì1550). Bayinnaung succeeded in three campaigns, 1556-9, to reduce the Shan states of Mohnyin, Mogaung, Momeik, Mong Pai (Moby√®), Saga, Lawksawk (Yatsauk), Yawnghwe, Hsipaw, Bhamo, Kalay, Chiang Mai, and Linzin (Vientiane), before he raided up the Taping and Shweli Rivers in 1562. A bell donated by King Bayinnaung (1551‚Äì1581) at Shwezigon Pagoda in Bagan has inscriptions in Burmese, Pali and Mon recording the conquest of Momeik and Hsipaw on 25 January 1557, and the building of a pagoda at Momeik on 8 February 1557. British rule The Saopha of Momeik had just died at the time of the British annexation in 1885 leaving a minor as heir, and the administration at Momeik was weak. It was included under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the Northern Division instead of the Superintendent of the Northern Shan States. A pretender named Hkam Leng came to claim the title, but he was rejected by the ministers. A Burmese prince called Saw Yan Naing, who had risen up against the British, fled to the area and joined forces with Hkam Leng, and caused a great deal of problems during 1888-9 to the Hampshire Regiment stationed at Momeik. Sao Hkun Hkio, Saopha of Momeik, was one of the seven Saophas on the Executive Committee of the Shan State Council formed after the first Panglong Conference in March 1946. On 16 January 1947, they sent two memoranda, whilst a Burmese delegation headed by Aung San was in London, to the British Labour government of Clement Attlee demanding equal political footing as Burma proper and full autonomy of the Federated Shan States. He was not one of the six Saophas who signed the Panglong Agreement on 12 February 1947. The Cambridge-educated Sao Hkun Hkio however became the longest serving Foreign Minister of Burma after independence in 1948 until the military coup of Ne Win in 1962, with only short interruptions, the longest one of which being between 1958 and 1960 during Ne Win's caretaker government. After independence The Shweli river valley and the hills around Momeik and Mogok are old strongholds of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) as early as the 1950s, but it was not until 1968 that the 1st Brigade of the CPB People's Army regained control of the area, and briefly captured Momeik itself in 1977. Their plan to strike west to the plains north of Mandalay however was thwarted by clashes with the Shan State Army and the Palaung State Liberation Army as well as government military offensives. The Shan State Army-North's 3rd Brigade has been active in Momeik, Kyaukme, Hsipaw, Namtu and Lashio. It reached a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese military government (SLORC) in 1989, and its activities have been severely curtailed. In 2005, an attempt by the Shan State Army-South based near the Thai border to fill the vacuum left by the cease-fire in the north was thwarted by the Burmese army. Economy Minerals Momeik is famous for its precious and semi-precious stones in its own right. Elbaite, a variant of Rubellite (Tourmaline or Anyant meaning 'inferior' in Burmese) including the \\"mushroom\\" tourmaline, and Petalite or Salinwa are mined in this region. Diamond found in Momeik region is believed to be derived from primary sources in north-western Australia but distinguishable from similar stones from eastern Australia. Gold mining in the area is being operated by Asia World and Shweli Yadana companies. Agriculture Mogok ruby mines rely on the staple Momeik rice. Hsinshweli strain high-yield rice as well as sugar cane, rubber, physic nut, jengkol bean and avocado are cultivated in the region.

Orson runs into the street as Edie's car approaches; swerving to avoid him, Edie crashes into a utility pole and is killed by a severed electrical wire. Reception The episode was heavily publicized due to the media attention publishing Edie's (Nicollette Sheridan) departure from the series after being one of the main five housewives for 5 seasons. Therefore, the episode managed to attract 14.75 million viewers in the US and was placed number 7 in US weekly ratings. The episode received extremely positive reviews, many critics praising the acting in the episode from Marcia Cross and Nicollette Sheridan. However many critics attacked the decision to kill Edie Britt, claiming it will harm the show, especially as it had already been so speculated. Mickey O'Connor responded with a positive review saying, 'It's a credit to Sheridan's acting that in the face of such devastating news (aka so she married an ax murderer!), the actress remains true to the character, who has larger cojones than any man on Wisteria Lane' and later saying, 'Except that Edie's death was the worst kept secret ever.' Notes *This is the second episode of the series (the first being 3.14 \\"I Remember That\\") to feature the use of the phrase \\"To Be Continued\\" at the end of the episode. Both cliffhangers were added to keep the viewers guessing whether a character (previously Orson, now Edie) will or will not survive a dangerous circumstance. * The title comes from the song \\"Broadway Baby\\" from the Stephen Sondheim musical Follies. *This episode attracted 14.75 million viewers and placed number 7 in US weekly ratings.

The hall was built c.1836 in the west of what is now Knowsley borough in Merseyside. The architect may have been John Cunningham, the designer of Liverpool Lime Street railway station. The estate stayed in the Gladstone family until the death of one of his sons in 1919, then was purchased in the same year by J. Bibby and Sons, cattle food manufacturers. The hall was used as a sports and social centre for the Bibby employees. By 1948 the hall was beginning to deteriorate and in 1951 the company sold it and the estate to Huyton-With-Roby Council. The hall was demolished in 1956 and part of the grounds were turned into a public park called Court Hey Park; the remainder of the estate was used for housing development.

Johnson to the Supreme Court of the United States are unusual in that Johnson appeared to have had specific individuals in mind for his appointments and actively sought to engineer vacancies on the Court to place those individuals on the court. Abe Fortas Associate Justice nomination Johnson intended early on to appoint his longtime friend and adviser Abe Fortas to the Court. Johnson thought that some of his Great Society reforms could be ruled unconstitutional by the Court, and he felt that Fortas would let him know if that was to happen. Johnson and Fortas did collaborate while Fortas was a justice; Fortas co-wrote Johnson's 1966 State of the Union speech. Rather than wait passively for a sitting Justice to retire, Johnson actively sought to persuade Justice Arthur Goldberg to resign his seat in order to become Ambassador to the United Nations. Goldberg's resignation from the court took effect on July 26, 1965. Goldberg wrote in his memoirs that he resigned in order to have influence in keeping the peace in Vietnam and that after the crisis had passed he expected he would be reappointed to the Supreme Court by Johnson. \\"I had an exaggerated opinion of my capacities. I thought I could persuade Johnson that we were fighting the wrong war in the wrong place [and] to get out.\\" Fortas was easily confirmed by the United States Senate on August 11, 1965. Thurgood Marshall nomination On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was \\"the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.\\" Although Johnson clearly did not have any other choices in mind, his advisers have been reported to have floated other names past him for the seat that eventually went to Marshall. In a group discussion, Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson, noted that \\"Lyndon has done so much\\" for blacks, and \\"why not indeed fill the vacancy with a woman.\\" Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorna E. Lockwood was the main contender. Also discussed was a California judge, Shirley Hufstedler, whom Johnson later placed on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In addition, a Johnson staff member, Larry Temple, had suggested Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., whom Johnson previously had appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Johnson dismissed Higginbotham as a possibility, telling Temple, \\"Larry, the only two people who ever heard of Judge Higginbotham are you and his momma.\\" Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69-11 on August 31, 1967.Graham, Fred P. (August 31, 1967) Senate Confirms Marshall As the First Negro Justice; 10 Southerners Oppose High Court Nominee in 69-to-11 Vote. New York Times. Abe Fortas Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry Associate Justice nominations When Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his retirement in June 1968, Johnson nominated Associate Justice Fortas to replace Warren as Chief Justice, and nominated Homer Thornberry (whom Johnson had previously appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1965) to the Associate Justice seat that Fortas would be vacating. Thornberry was chosen out of a larger field of candidates who were considered, including former United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie, United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler and prominent lawyer Albert E. Jenner, Jr. However, the Warren Court's form of jurisprudence had angered many conservative members of the United States Senate, and the nomination of Fortas provided the first opportunity for these senators to register their disenchantment with the direction of the Court; they planned to filibuster Fortas' nomination. Senate Judiciary Committee chair James Eastland told Johnson he \\"had never seen so much feeling against a man as against Fortas.\\" Fortas was the first Chief Justice nominee ever to appear before the Senate, and he faced hostile questioning about his relationship with Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson sought to help Fortas win a majority vote, but only as a face-saving measure, according to Johnson aide Joseph Califano: The debate on Fortas's nomination had lasted for less than a week, led by Republicans and conservative southern Democrats, or so-called \\"Dixiecrats\\". Several senators who opposed Fortas asserted at the time that they were not conducting a perpetual filibuster and were not trying to prevent a final up-or-down vote from occurring.Cornyn, John. \\"Our Broken Judicial Confirmation Process and the Need for Filibuster Reform,\\" Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, Volume 27, page 181 (2003). Retrieved 2007-02-16. However, the Senate web site now characterizes the debate as the first filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee. In 1968, Senate rules required two-thirds of senators present to stop a debate (now 60% of the full Senate is needed). The 45 to 43 cloture vote to end the Fortas debate included 10 Republicans and 35 Democrats voting for cloture, and 24 Republicans and 19 Democrats voting against cloture. The 12 other senators, all Democrats, were not present. The New York Times wrote of the 45 to 43 cloture roll call: \\"Because of the unusual crosscurrents underlying today's vote, it was difficult to determine whether the pro-Fortas supporters would have been able to muster the same majority in a direct confirmation vote.\\"Babington, Charles, \\"Filibuster Precedent? Democrats Point to '68 and Fortas\\", Washington Post (2005-03-18). Retrieved 2007-02-16. Once Fortas withdrew his nomination in October 1968, Thornberry's nomination became moot and was withdrawn by the White House without a vote. Former Justice Arthur Goldberg later claimed that he was Earl Warren's preference to succeed him.Bernard Schwartz, Super Chief: Earl Warren and his Supreme Court (New York: New York University Press, 1983), p. 720. After Fortas's nomination was withdrawn in the face of Senate opposition, Johnson briefly considered naming Goldberg as Chief Justice as a recess appointment before rejecting the idea.Stebenne, Goldberg, 373. The next president, Republican Richard Nixon, appointed Warren Burger the next Chief Justice. David Leonhardt of The New York Times called Johnson's nomination of Fortas \\"one of the most consequential blunders in modern American politics\\" as the chair has been held by conservatives appointed by Republican presidents ever since.David Leonhardt (June 2, 2014). \\"The Supreme Court Blunder That Liberals Tend to Make\\", The New York Times.

He was the son of theologian Joachim Christian Gass (1766‚Äì1831). He received his education in Breslau, Halle and Berlin, and as a student was influenced by the teachings of August Neander (1789‚Äì1850). In 1846 he became an associate professor at the University of Breslau, and during the following year relocated to Greifswald, where in 1855 he achieved the title of professor ordinarius. In 1862 he was appointed professor of systematic theology at the University of Giessen, and in 1868 moved to Heidelberg as a successor to Richard Rothe (1799‚Äì1867). He died in 1889 in Heidelberg His theological work largely dealt with the history of Protestant dogmatics, studies of the Greek Orthodox Church during the Middle Ages and the history of Christian ethics. Among his more important written works was the four-volume Geschichte der Lutherischen Dogmatik (History of Lutheran Dogmatics 1854-67), and an 1846 book on Georgius Calixtus and syncretism called Georg Calixt und der Synkretismus.

All Tremella species are parasites of other fungi and most produce anamorphic yeast states. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous and are colloquially classed among the \\"jelly fungi\\". Over 100 species of Tremella are currently recognized worldwide. Two species, Tremella fuciformis and Tremella aurantialba, are commercially cultivated for food. Taxonomy History Tremella was one of the original genera created by Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum of 1753. The name comes from the Latin tremere meaning \\"to tremble\\". Linnaeus placed Tremella in the algae, including within it a variety of gelatinous growths, including seaweeds, cyanobacteria, and myxomycetes, as well as fungi. Subsequent authors added additional species to this mix, until Persoon revised Tremella in 1794 and 1801, repositioning the genus within the fungi. Persoon's reinterpretation of Tremella was sufficiently radical to be considered a separate genus (Tremella Pers.) from that originally created by Linnaeus (Tremella L.). Tremella Pers. has now been conserved under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, with Tremella mesenterica as the type species. Current status Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests that Tremella is polyphyletic (and hence artificial), the genus not being clearly separated from other genera within the Tremellaceae. Comparatively few species, however, have yet been sequenced. More than 500 species have been described in Tremella, but most of these are old names of doubtful application or old names for species later transferred to other genera. Over 100 species are currently accepted within the genus. Description Fruit bodies (when present) are gelatinous. In some species they are small (under 5 mm across) and pustular to pulvinate (cushion-shaped). In others they are much larger (up to 150 mm across) and may be variously lobed, cephaliform (like a brain, with folds and ridges), or foliose (with leaf-like or seaweed-like fronds). Many Tremella species, however, are hymenial parasites, producing spores within the fruit bodies of their hosts, and are only visible microscopically. Microscopic characters Tremella species produce hyphae that are typically (but not always) clamped and have haustorial cells from which hyphal filaments seek out and penetrate the hyphae of the host. The basidia are \\"tremelloid\\" (globose to ellipsoid, sometimes stalked, and vertically or diagonally septate), giving rise to long, sinuous sterigmata or epibasidia on which the basidiospores are produced. These spores are smooth, globose to ellipsoid, and germinate by hyphal tube or by yeast cells. Conidiophores are often present, producing conidiospores that are similar to yeast cells. Habitat and distribution Species are mainly parasitic on wood-rotting fungi in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, particularly on species that occur on dead attached branches. Hosts include members of the corticioid fungi, polypores, and Dacrymycetales in the Basidiomycota and species of Diaporthe, other Sordariomycetes, and lichens in the Ascomycota. Some Tremella species parasitize the fruit bodies of their hosts (sometimes incorporating host hyphae), others parasitize the mycelium within the wood. As a group, Tremella species occur worldwide, though individual species may have a more restricted distribution. Species and hosts The list below includes species that have recently been described or redescribed. Some additional older species may also be valid, but lack a modern description.

It has been assumed that each mode has a unique song sung by that character. On February 17, 2009, a second trailer was released. This seven-minute video went into the game in more detail, explaining various aspects and showing more clips. The game was released in Japan on May 25, 2009, and is unlikely to leave into overseas territories. This pachisuro also features many remixes of previous Goemon music (mostly from Goemon's Great Adventure). A sequel, Ganbare Goemon Pachisuro 2, was released in September 2011. It is based on Ganbare Goemon 2: Kiteretsu Sh≈çgun Magginesu for the Super Famicom.

Early life Michael was born in 1869 and lived on what is now known as 3698 Moina Michael Road in Good Hope, in Walton County, Georgia. She was the eldest daughter and second of the seven children of John Marion Michael, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, and Alice Sherwood Wise.Hudson, Paul S., and Lora Mirza. \\"Moina Belle Michael (1869‚Äì1944).\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia. 15 February 2019. Retrieved 2019-08-15. She was distantly related to General Francis Marion on her father's side, and the Wise family of Virginia state governors on her mother's side. Both sides of her family had Huguenot ancestry, with origins in Brittany and Flanders respectively. Her family was wealthy and owned a cotton plantation until 1898. She was educated at Braswell Academy in Morgan County, and the Martin Institute in Jefferson, Georgia.Mlle Michael Biography (1869‚Äì1944), greatwar.co.uk She became a teacher in 1885, initially in Good Hope and then in Monroe, Georgia. She taught at the Lucy Cobb Institute and Normal School, both located in Athens, Georgia. She studied at Columbia University in New York City in 1912‚Äì13. First World War Michael visited Europe in June and July 1914. She was in Germany when the First World War broke out in August 1914, and travelled to Rome to return home to the US. In Rome, she assisted around 12,000 US tourists to seek passage back across the Atlantic. She returned to the US on the RMS Carpathia and returned to teaching at Normal School in Athens, Georgia. She was a professor at the University of Georgia when the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917. She took a leave of absence from her work and volunteered to assist in the New York-based training headquarters for overseas YWCA workers. Remembrance poppy On 9 November 1918, inspired by the Canadian John McCrae battlefront- theme poem \\"In Flanders Fields\\", she wrote a poem in response called \\"We Shall Keep the Faith\\". In tribute to the opening lines of McCrae's poem ‚Äì \\"In Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses row on row,\\" ‚Äì Michael vowed to always wear a red poppy as a symbol of remembrance for those who served in the war. After the war was over, Michael returned to the University of Georgia and taught a class of disabled servicemen. Realizing the need to provide financial and occupational support for these servicemen, she pursued the idea of selling silk poppies as a means of raising funds to assist disabled veterans. In 1921, her efforts resulted in the poppy being adopted as a symbol of remembrance for war veterans by the American Legion Auxiliary, and by Earl Haig's British Legion Appeal Fund (later The Royal British Legion) later that year. Later life Known as the \\"Poppy Lady\\" for her humanitarian efforts, Michael received numerous awards during her lifetime. She retired from the University of Georgia in 1934, and published an autobiography in 1941, The Miracle Flower: The Story of the Flanders Fields Memorial Poppy. In 1944, a Liberty ship constructed in Georgia was named SS Moina Michael in her honor. In 1948, four years after her death, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative 3-cent stamp honoring her life's achievement. In 1969, the Georgia General Assembly named a section of U.S. Highway 78 the Moina Michael Highway. In 1999 she was named to the Georgia Women of Achievement Hall of Fame. She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

It was released on December 14, 2010, by Bad Boy Records and Interscope Records. It is the fifth album for Diddy as a solo artist, and the only album for Dirty Money (the duo disbanded in 2012). The album describes Diddy's alter-ego as he travels from London to Paris to regain his lost love. Last Train to Paris is predominately hip hop, but incorporates elements of Eurodance, Italo disco and tech house. Guest vocalists on the album include Grace Jones, Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Skylar Grey, Drake, Justin Timberlake, Nicki Minaj, T.I., Wiz Khalifa, Swizz Beatz, Trey Songz, Rick Ross, Usher, Sevyn Streeter, James Fauntleroy, Bilal and The Notorious B.I.G. The album also features vocal segues from designers and editors of the fashion world, including Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and Tommy Hilfiger. The executive producers on the album are Rodney Jerkins, Diddy, Mario Winans and Herve Pierre. The album marks Diddy's debut with Interscope Records, after he moved his label (Bad Boy) from Atlantic Records in 2009. Last Train to Paris was generally well received by critics who praised the addition of Richard and Harper to help Diddy innovate a new sound. The album was preceded by the release of four singles: \\"Angels\\", \\"Hello Good Morning\\", \\"Loving You No More\\" and \\"Coming Home\\", which received mixed success on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Coming Home\\" was the most successful of the singles, peaking at number 12 on the United States. During its opening week Last Train to Paris outperformed expectations, debuting eight places higher than predicted at number 7 on the US Billboard 200. It sold 101,000 copies, compared to the 60,000-70,000 copies that Billboard had predicted it would sell.  Conception  Diddy described Last Train to Paris as an \\"electro-hip- hop-soul funk\\" album which has been three years in the making. Diddy says the sound of this album was influenced \\"by being in the dance music world and doing stuff with Felix da Housecat, Erick Morillo, Deep Dish, DJ Hell and being in Ibiza and DC10.\\" The arc follows Diddy's character as he tours from London to Paris and finds the woman of his dreams - only to lose her, find her, lose her again and find her a final time. The records were conceptualised from Diddy's comments to his producers. He told Alex da Kid (who produced \\"Coming Home\\") \\"I want a beat that makes me feel like a white man in a basement in Atlanta.\\" Diddy said that \\"most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time. The records came together by hanging out with them, taking them to parties and showing them movies\\". In an interview with MTV News, Diddy said \\"One of the things [Dirty Money] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records out right now ‚Äî no disrespect to them, but they're all surface. It's about what people have or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion ‚Äî you get a feeling, a vibe.\\" Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was \\"assembled from 60 or so songs. The genesis of Last Train to Paris is full of odd stories involving our hero, ensconced in a darkened studio, barking batty ideas to his production team.\\"  Dirty Money  Last Train to Paris is officially credited to Diddy ‚Äì Dirty Money. Dirty Money was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside him on the album. In an interview with All Hip- Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is \\"not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative\\". Instead he described it as \\"a sound, a movement, [and] a crew\\", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that \\"he wanted to tell a love story\\" but needed Dirty Money because \\"he couldn‚Äôt just tell the male‚Äôs point of view.\\" Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at \\"a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, and all of a sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. I was sitting there with a bunch of money and I was like, 'Damn, this is some dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day.\\" Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as \\"fleshing out Last Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy.\\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money \\"sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing\\", on the disk. Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album \\"attitude and style\\". He said \\"the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand.\\" David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as \\"fine background singers or part of Diddy‚Äôs Fashion Week posse.\\" Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, \\"Diddy takes a backseat\\" which allowed \\"Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of the heavy lifting (and breathing) on a wide range of songs.\\" Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he \\"wanted to flip things\\" by having two girls and one guy in the band. \\"Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me\\". He told Amos Barshad from New York that \\"[The girls in Dirty Money] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace.\\"  Album cover  The album cover is a photograph at Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris, France) taken by Australian cricket writer and photographer Jarrod \\"Jrod\\" Kimber.  Guest vocals  Guests included on the album were initially confirmed as Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown, Drake, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, T.I., Swizz Beatz, Grace Jones, Bilal and Wiz Khalifa but the final track list also included Skylar Grey. Richard told MTV News that the album had been in the making before she and Harper joined Diddy to form Dirty Money. She said \\"I know when Kalenna and I speak, we sometimes feel giddy because people like pioneers of the game said, 'You know what? We want to be on your album,'\\". Richard also defended the number of guests on the album stating that it was a \\"labor of love\\" which is why the group felt like the album needed a \\"stunning introduction\\" to the world. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly said the role of the guests on the album \\"[mainly] assorted suave fellows... help fill out [Diddy]'s side of the conversation.\\" Vogue was first to reveal that editors and fashion designers have recorded vocal segues for the album. Among those set to feature on the album are Isaac Mizrahi, Andr√© Leon Talley, Zac Posen, Marc Jacobs, Anna Wintour (editor in chief at Vogue) and Tommy Hilfiger. Talley said of his involved in the album, \\"[Diddy]'s like great creative thinkers in music who love fashion; swooner Marvin Gaye in his duets with Tammi Terrell comes to mind ‚Äî what sense of elegance, what Motown glamour!\\"  Promotion  On November 21, 2010 Diddy-Dirty Money appeared at the American Music Awards (2010) where they performed \\"Coming Home\\". On December 5, 2010 Diddy released The Prelude - Last Train to Paris, a free mixtape of seven songs from the upcoming album exclusively through Vogue.com.

HateLove features at least four songs from the Last Train to Paris recording sessions plus other songs.

Critical reception  Upon its release, Last Train to Paris received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 13 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly said \\"Last Train to Pariss glittery grooves feel authentically his own.\\" He called Last Train a throwback to Diddy's 2007 hit single \\"Last Night\\". It's the \\"electro-laced torch duet blown out to full album length\\". He concluded by saying \\"the sheer number of cameos overwhelms the narrative conceit after a while... But who really cares? By that time, you just might be enjoying yourself way too much to notice.\\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News was impressed with Dirty Money's contribution to the album. He said \\"their input gives the CD a cohesion otherwise disrupted by Diddy's usual conga line of guest stars.\\" He pointed out that the album takes on a Eurodance sound and although people might see it as \\"leaping on that bandwagon but as it turns out, the milieu proves a much better fit for his, er, talents, than any CD he has released so far.\\" Farber concluded by saying \\"The Euro edge gives the music a leg up on the more conservative (read: American) dance music favored by the most mainstream club act of now -- those ever mushy Peas.\\" Andy Gill of The Independent noted Dirty Money's \\"emphasis on emotion over purely dance imperatives\\" and dubbed the album \\"easily the best work Diddy's been involved with in his entire career.\\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian gave it three out of five stars and stated, \\"The album is a mess, but a hook-heavy, likable one.\\" David Jeffries from AllMusic noted Diddy's \\"unfiltered self\\" and \\"unique attitude\\", stating \\"This hook-filled, vibrant effort is that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level and then put a little strut back in your step.\\" Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R&B; vocals from Dirty Money and the guest features from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that \\"There‚Äôs no telling why she turns up but she sounds right at home on the thumping club anthem. [Grace's] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them.\\" Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said \\"Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy‚Äôs word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It's lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it's overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that‚Äôs taken over as of late.\\" Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said \\"Last Train to Paris is one of the first records that's really made me feel like [Diddy] sounds clever. [However he] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if you want to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... [But] this album hits its mood right, though ‚Äî gray skies, Eurorail, and drama ‚Äî it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be.\\"  Track listing  Sample credits *\\"Someone to Love Me\\" contains samples of \\"You Roam When You Don't Get It At Home\\" performed by The Sweet Inspirations, written by Bettye Crutcher, David Porter and Ronnie Williams. *\\"Angels\\" contains elements of \\"My Downfall\\" written by Sean Combs, Christopher Wallace, Darryl McDaniels, Nashiem Myrick and Carlos Broady, and elements and samples of \\"Where I'm From\\" written by Deric Angelletie, Ronald Lawrence, Shawn Carter and Norman Whitfield, and performed by Jay-Z.

Zeitschrift f√ºr christliche Spiritualit√§t (Spirit and Life. Review for Christian Spirituality) is a bimonthly review published by the German Society of Jesus. Dedicated to the theology of spiritual life, Christian mysticism, and the spiritual practice thereof, it is the only review its kind in German. It appears six times per year, with 80 pages each issue. Geist und Leben was founded 1926 in Innsbruck as Zeitschrift f√ºr Aszese und Mystik (Review for Ascesis and Mysticism). The basic modern concept of the journal was created by F. Friedrich Wulf SJ, the journal's editor from 1947 to 1989, who took part as a theological consultant in the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Its theological program is influenced by the Spanish review La vida sobrenatural, founded by J.G. Arintero OP (Bilbao 1921) and the French Revue d‚Äôascetique et de mystique, established by J. de Guibert SJ (Toulouse 1920). Its editorial program is informed by an \\"integrative spirituality\\" in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order. It accepts contributions of quality written in English with a view to translation into German. The aim of Geist und Leben is to provide a forum in which people from different theological traditions, who are interested in spirituality, reflect on the Holy Spirit's action in the Church and in their personal lives. It has been published under the title Geist und Leben since 1947 (vol. 20) at Echter Verlag in W√ºrzburg, Germany. From 1929 to 2004 the editorial office was located in Munich; today it is located in Cologne. Other Jesuit reviews of Christian spirituality are The Way (Oxford), Christus (Paris), Manresa (Madrid), and Review for Religious (Saint Louis, Missouri). Literature * \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Aszese u.

In a managerial career that lasted for forty years from 1926 until 1966 he guided the Cork senior inter-county team to twelve All-Ireland titles.  Early Life  James Barry, son of John and Mary (n√©e Lynch), was born in the Lying-in Hospital in Cork on the 31st July 1893.'James Barry' (1893) Certified copy of birth register for James Barry, 31 July 1893.

James‚Äô parents already had three children when he was born; they would go on to have eight children in total, of whom six (four girls and two boys) would survive the high child mortality of the time. The Barry family lived on Grattan Street in 1893 but later moved to nearby Penrose Square. Following after the profession of his father, James started working as a tailor when he left school.1901 Census of Ireland, Cork County, District Electoral Division (DED) Cork No. 7 Urban, West Ward, Penrose Square, unpaginated, household no. 9, James Barry; digital image, National Archives of Ireland, Census of Ireland 1901/1911 (http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie : accessed 23 July 2020); original manuscript not cited.1911 Census of Ireland, Cork County, District Electoral Division (DED) Cork No. 7, Penrose Square, unpaginated, household no. 2, James Barry; digital image, National Archives of Ireland, Census of Ireland 1901/1911 (http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie : accessed 23 July 2020); original manuscript not cited. James had a love of music, especially Opera and was blessed with an excellent tenor voice. He was also a keen sportsman; he was Irish Springboard champion for four years and earned his nickname 'Tough' as a result of his boxing career during which he fought as a Bantamweight.Cork: A History In the All Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Volume One 1887-1949 by T.M. Mhicchonbhui ()  Gaelic Games  It is for his success in Gaelic Games that Jim Barry is most remembered. As a young man he hurled with the Blackrock Club. He joined the Cork set-up in 1926 as assistant trainer to Pakey Mahony. With his background in amateur swimming and boxing Barry is credited with bringing a forward-thinking and holistic approach to preparing players. He often visited workplaces to talk to employers on behalf of his players, demanded proper meals for his squads after matches, and was renowned for his ability to have them perfectly pitched for the biggest games. Barry helped guide Cork to League and Championship success in his first year. More All Irelands followed in 1928 and 1929, and another league was won in 1930. Barry's Cork team won the All-Ireland again in 1931. In 1934, he was a guest trainer with the Limerick when they won the League and the All-Ireland. His Cork team lost to Kilkenny in the 1939 All Ireland final and won the league in 1940. Barry became the first manager to win four All Ireland titles in a row from 1941 to 1944 (the first year also saw another league win). He trained the Cork Football team to All-Ireland victory in 1945 and also refereed that year's Minor Hurling final. His Cork side beat Kilkenny in the 1946 All Ireland final but were beaten by the cats the following year. Cork won the League again in 1948. Barry's Cork returned for another run of multiple All-Ireland's, a three-in-a-row, from 1952-1954 (the middle year also saw another league won). There was then a barren period for 12 years before Cork returned with a shock victory over old rivals Kilkenny in the 1966 final. It was after this final that Barry said, ‚ÄúIn Cork, hurlers come up overnight like mushrooms‚Äù. Tough Barry suffered a stroke in October 1968 and passed away in the South Infirmary a few days later.

He is an international lobbyist for the independence of West Papua from Indonesia. He lives in exile in the United Kingdom. In 2003 he was granted political asylum by the British government following his escape from custody while on trial. He has acted as special representative of the Papuan people in the British Parliament, United Nations and European Parliament. In 2017 he was appointed as the chairman for the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), a new organisation uniting the three main political organisations struggling for the independence of West Papua. Early life Wenda was born in 1975 in Pyramid Village in the Baliem Valley, in the central highlands of West Papua. In 1977 there was a rebellion of 15,000 Lani people in response to Indonesian military violence towards Papuans. The Indonesian military retaliated, with aircraft bombing Lani villages in the highlands. Those killed included many of Wenda's family. During the bombing raids, one of Wenda's legs was severely injured leading to impaired growth. Between 1977 and 1983 Benny and his family, along with thousands of other highlanders, lived in hiding in the jungle. He was appointed leader by the elders in his tribe, and later after the Lani people surrendered to the Indonesian military he attended a state university, in Jayapura, studying Sociology. Political leadership Wenda became Secretary- General of Demmak (Dewan Musyawarah Masyarakat Koteka), the Koteka Tribal Assembly. Demmak was established by highland tribal elders with the goal of working towards recognition and protection of the customs, values and beliefs of the tribal people of the West Papuan Highlands. It advocates independence from Indonesia, and rejects special autonomy or any other political compromise offered by the Indonesian government. As Secretary-General of Demmak, Wenda represented the council of elders. The organisation supported PDP negotiations with Jakarta to the extent that they represented the aspiration of the Papuan peoples, which they claimed was independence from Indonesia. Imprisonment Wenda was placed on trial in 2002 for allegedly leading a procession of people in an independence rally. The demonstration turned violent, with Indonesian authorities alleging that those present torched two shops and murdered a policeman. Wenda maintains that his arrest and the charges against him were politically motivated, coming at a time when authorities were clamping down on leaders of the independence movement. This clampdown had led to the assassination a few months earlier of the leading pro-independence figure Theys Eluay. Media reports state that Wenda was facing a 25-year jail sentence if found guilty. He was also allegedly subjected to death threats whilst being held in custody. Wenda escaped prison while on trial. Helped by West Papua independence activists he fled across the border to neighbouring Papua New Guinea and was later reunited with his wife Maria at a refugee camp. Several months after this he was helped by a European NGO to travel to the UK where he was granted political asylum. Interpol In 2011, the Indonesian Government issued an Interpol red notice seeking Mr Wenda's arrest and extradition. However, after a campaign led by Fair Trials International, in 2012 Interpol removed the red notice after an investigation concluded that the allegations against Mr Wenda were \\"politically motivated and an abuse of the system\\" by the Indonesian Government. Speaking after Interpol had announced they had removed the red notice from their database, Jago Russell, Fair Trials International's chief executive stated \\"Interpol should be used to fight serious crime but Indonesia has been misusing it to threaten a peaceful political activist\\". In an interview with UK national the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Mr Wenda stated that he hoped attention would now \\"shift to the plight of my people in West Papua, who continue to suffer under an Indonesian regime that denies them almost every basic right that people in the West take for granted.\\" Free West Papua Campaign After arriving in the United Kingdom, Benny became the leading spokesperson for the Free West Papua Campaign, which was founded in 2004 by a group of pro-Papuan activists in Oxford. The campaign's stated aims are to spread awareness of the human rights situation and independence aspirations of the people of West Papua, through lobbying governments and developing support throughout civil society. The Free West Papua Campaign movement in the UK has grown to include permanent student groups at British universities and regional groups, as well as permanent offices in Oxford, the Hague and Port Moresby. In February 2013 Wenda undertook a 'Freedom Tour' to the US, New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, with the aim of raising awareness of the self-determination issue. He was blocked from holding a speech at New Zealand national parliament. Opposition parties accused the government of not wanting to upset the Indonesian Government, an important trading partner. Politicians of the Greens, Labour and Mana said the decision went \\"against the spirit of Parliament\\". In April 2013, Wenda was joined by Mohammed Abassi, the Lord Mayor of Oxford and local MP Andrew Smith for the opening of a new headquarters for the Free West Papua Campaign. The opening provoked an angry response from the Indonesian Government, with the British Ambassador to Indonesia being summoned to explain why the UK had allowed the office to open. In May 2013, Wenda spoke at the Sydney Opera House as part of the TEDx series, getting a standing ovation in front of the audience of 2,500 people. His appearance again provoked an angry response from the Indonesian authorities, with them launching an official complaint with the Australian government within hours of him taking the stage. International Parliamentarians for West Papua Inaugural meeting of the International Parliamentarians for West Papua, 2008 With British MP Andrew Smith and Lords peer Richard Harries, Benny Wenda is a founding member of the International Parliamentarians for West Papua. This cross-parliamentary group was launched at the Houses of Parliament in London in October 2008, and was attended by British parliamentarians including Lembit √ñpik and Baron Avebury, as well as politicians from Papua New Guinea, Australia and Vanuatu. The group is actively developing support from politicians around the world, and its overall aim is to assert enough political pressure on the United Nations to implement a re-run of the Act of Free Choice. As well as the UK launch, IPWP has also had launch events in the European Parliament, Scottish Parliament and also Papua New Guinea. International Lawyers for West Papua In April 2009, Benny Wenda launched the International Lawyers for West Papua. The launch saw a series of high level meetings held by international lawyers in Guyana in South America. The aim of this group is to develop a framework within the international legal community towards outlining the legal basis for West Papuan self- determination, and the \\"illegality\\" of the Indonesian \\"occupation of West Papua\\". The launch of International Lawyers for West Papua coincided with Guyana stating their support for West Papuan independence. Awards Benny Wenda has been nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2019 he was awarded the Freedom of Oxford by Oxford City Council in the UK. Lord Mayor of Oxford Craig Simmons said the accolade was \\"well-deserved\\" and Mr Wenda was \\"contributing so much both locally and on the international stage\\". The Lani Singers Benny and his wife Maria perform traditional West Papuan music as The Lani Singers. In 2008 they released their debut album. Entitled Ninalik Ndawi (Freedom Song), it received reviews in national newspapers including the Guardian and Observer, and music magazines fRoots, Songlines and The Wire. The group undertook interviews and live sessions on World Routes on BBC Radio 3 and A World in London on BBC Radio London. They have also performed at Musicport Festival, Glastonbury Festival and the Thames Festival in London. Family life Benny and Maria met while studying in West Papua, and have been married since 1999. Since being granted political asylum by the British Government they have lived in Oxford with their children.

Partridge decides to observe a minute's silence, but realises - as it is radio - that a minute of 'dead air' is impossible. He therefore intersperses the silence with an occasional utterance. Thus he suggests to listeners on the road to pull off and join in the minute's silence. He even goes as far as naming a few service stations where they can park their cars. One of them is Toddington. In 2004, Toddington Services featured in series 4, episode 3 of Top Gear with the three presenters comparing a Volvo 760, Audi 80 and Rover 416GTi before proceeding up the M1 and M6 to Old Trafford.

Designed to counter negative stereotypes of Muslims, the network received attention from publications and media venues such as Variety, NBC News, the Voice of America, Columbus Dispatch, Detroit Free Press, San Jose Mercury News, Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, The Buffalo News and Canadian Press.Catholic Online: U.S. Muslim Beheads Wife (2/17/2009) In July 2011, Bridges TV moved to New York City in hopes of broadening its influence across America with help from Soundview Broadcasting. The move crippled the company and was only meant for Soundview to absorb Bridges TV's customers and its small influence in the Muslim American Market. The channel suffered a setback when its founder beheaded his estranged wife. Content By focusing its content on the experiences of the estimated eight million Muslims living in North America, Bridges TV differentiates itself from such foreign language programming as Geo TV (which broadcasts in Urdu), Prime TV (which broadcasts in Urdu) and Arab Radio and Television Network (which broadcasts in Arabic). Around the time of its inception, the network announced that it would seek to feature sitcoms that represent American Muslim family life in a positive way and identified The Cosby Show as a model for such programming. In late 2005, Bridges TV started airing \\"Current Issues\\", a show produced in Lafayette, Louisiana about Palestinian and other Middle Eastern concerns. The Palestinian American host, Hesham Tillawi, is known for vocalizing criticism against Israel's treatment of Arabs and Muslims. The Anti-Defamation League called his show \\"a megaphone for Holocaust deniers and white supremacists seeking to broadcast their hatred and anti-Semitism into American homes with a \\"who's who\\" of notable American antisemites including David Duke, Willis Carto, Edgar J. Steele, Mark Weber, and Bradley Smith. Another program shown on Bridges TV, \\"American Pilgrimage\\", featured Rabbi Brad Hirschfield visiting homes and mosques of leading imams and Muslim religious thinkers across North America in cities including Halifax, Detroit, San Francisco, New York City and Washington, D.C. The series has been described as \\"groundbreaking\\" and has been characterized as having a \\"Charlie Rose meets Charles Kuralt\\" format. World heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, a subscriber and spokesperson for the network, said: \\"Bridges TV gives American Muslims a voice of their own on the airwaves for Americans of all races and religions to hear.\\" Network official expressed the opinion that a channel like Bridges TV was long overdue and market research sponsored by the network revealed American Muslims' willingness to pay as much as $10 per month above and beyond their current cable television or satellite television fee for the channel. Leadership Muzzammil S. Hassan, founder and CEO of Bridges TV, expressed belief \\"that moderate Muslims cannot identify with the extreme stereotypes often depicted in Hollywood productions\\" and said \\"They think they are not accurately portrayed...Bridges TV gives American Muslims a voice and will depict them in everyday, real life situations.\\" Hassan also said he hoped the Bridges TV network would balance negative portrayals of Muslims following the attacks on September 11, 2001.

Douglas Watt from the Daily News said \\"the performance and mounting of the work are flawless... in an eventually moving piece of theatre one of its assets is the fine work by Felicity Dean as mistress Anne\\". Walter Kerr of The New York Times offered that \\"Felicity Dean is excellent in the role\\". While Jack Knoll of Newsweek said \\" The cast are excellent, notably Felicity Dean as the nubile student who becomes Halders mistress\\" Other stage work includes An Honourable Trade directed by Mike Bradwell for The Royal Court, Olivia in Twelfth Night for Nancy Meckler, for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Bianca in The Taming of the Shrew directed by Jonathan Miller, Julietta in Hyde Park, and Caroline in The Churchill Play, both for Barry Kyle.

Benedict Nightingale of The Times wrote \\"formidably played by Felicity Dean\\" of her interpretation. The Spectator added \\"Felicity Dean also gives a powerful star turn as Fanny Wilton\\" and Jack Tinker of The Daily Mail \\"The entire production is on this high plateau of performance.

Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph noted that \\"Felicity Dean doesn't confine herself merely to capturing Regan's spite.

David Giles cast her in 2009 in Underfoot in Showbusiness, a fast-paced new comedy from acclaimed New York writer Charles Leipart.

Television In 1977 Felicity played a significant guest role as Sara Seaford in the 2nd episode of the first season of the hard-hitting police drama The Professionals, entitled 'The Female Factor' (by Brian Clemens) starring opposite Gordon Jackson, Martin Shaw and Lewis Collins. English novelist Rebecca West, perhaps best known for her reports on the Nuremberg Trials, personally picked Dean to play Laura Bowen, the heroine of her novel The Birds Fall Down in a five-part BBC adaptation produced by Jonathan Powell in 1978.

He composed it in Leipzig for the Feast of the Ascension and first performed it on 30 May 1726. It begins with a quotation from Psalm 47.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his third year in Leipzig for the feast of Ascension. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the prologue and Ascension (), and from the Gospel of Mark, Jesus telling his disciples to preach and baptise, and his Ascension (). The text of the cantata is unusual as it consists mostly of a poem in six stanzas, which forms movements 5 to 10 of the work in 11 movements. The structure is similar to that of cantatas by Bach's cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, court conductor in Meiningen, that Bach performed during 1726: Old Testament quotation, recitative, aria, New Testament quotation, poem, chorale. The first quotation is taken from Psalm 47 () and is traditionally understood as a reference to the Ascension. The other quotation in movement 4 is verse 19 from the gospel. An unknown poet paraphrased in recitative and aria an idea from Psalm 68 () as well as its quotation in the Epistle to the Ephesians (), \\"when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive\\". In movement 7 he used the motif of Christ in the winepress. The cantata is closed by the first and thirteenth stanza of Johann Rist's hymn \\"\\" (1641). Bach would later use stanza four of the chorale for his Ascension Oratorio. The cantata consists of two parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. Bach first performed it on 30 May 1726.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is festively scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani (tamburi in the autograph), two oboes, two violins, viola and basso continuo. ::Part I # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (soprano): # Aria (soprano): ::Part II # * Recitative (bass): # Aria (bass): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (soprano): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus with the full orchestra is the \\"centre of gravity\\" of the cantata. It opens with an introduction marked \\"adagio\\", played by the strings doubled by the oboes. Then a fugue begins, two instrumental entries are followed by choral entries, a climax is reached in an entry of the first trumpet. A second fugue includes remote and minor keys. The second part of the text, \\"\\" (sing praises to God, sing praises unto our King) is first sung in homophony, but then presented in a third fugue on the theme of the first, followed by a homophonic coda. A secco recitative leads to the first aria, accompanied by the violins in unison. The complete text is sung three times in different sections. The New Testament quotation is sung not by the bass as the but, likely because Jesus is not speaking himself, instead the soprano narrates \\"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God\\" as a secco recitative. Movement 5 concludes Part I and is based on the first stanza of the poem. The soprano is accompanied by the strings, doubled by the oboes. In the middle section, the words \\"\\" (He finishes His course on earth, literally: \\"He finishes the course of the earth\\") are expressed by an upward melisma and one downward on the repeat of the words. Part II handles the other five stanzas of the poem, alternating recitative and aria. The first recitative is accompanied by the strings, the others are secco. The bass aria is highlighted by an obbligato trumpet part, but it is so difficult that Bach gave it to a violin in a later performance. The words \\"\\" (full of sorrow, torment and pain) are illustrated by a slower tempo and harmonic tension. The following recitative refers in the end to the view towards heaven, expressed by an upward motion. The last aria, accompanied by the oboes, enjoys the victory over the enemies, in a vision of peace rather than a description of a battle, but stresses the words \\"\\" (out of suffering, distress and ignominy) by \\"harmonic darkening\\". The closing chorale is a four-part setting of the melody of ', composed by Johann Schop in 1641. According to Klaus Hofmann, the setting was composed not by Bach himself, but by Christoph Peter (1626‚Äì89), cantor in Guben, as printed in the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch (New Leipzig hymnal) of 1682.

Wolf. It concentrates on the life of Milada, an eleven-year-old Czech girl who lives during World War II, after Hitler annexes Czechoslovakia during the years 1942‚Äì1945. Plot summary Milada, a young Czechoslovakian girl, lives in the village of Lidice. The book starts with her and her friends hanging out on her 11th birthday when Milada receives a telescope. The next days, Nazis break into their home. She doesn't understand at first when Nazi soldiers come to her house, ordering them to pack belongings for three days and leave the house. Her father and her older brother, Jaroslav, are separated from the rest of the family to be taken elsewhere; Milada, her mother, younger sister Anechka, and grandmother, are subsequently held together with the rest of the female inhabitants of Lidice, in a building. Milada is taken to a health examination where her facial features are measured and checked by doctors. With her \\"perfect\\" features, blue eyes, and blonde hair, Milada fits the \\"Aryan ideal\\" and is separated from her family, and is sent to a center outside of Puschkau, Poland. At the center, Milada is renamed Eva, a more \\"German\\" name, and the other girls are renamed too. The center employs harsh disciplinary methods and the girls are schooled in the German language, Nazi philosophies, and home economics so they can eventually join the German society. As hard as she works to remember, she forgets a little about herself in the process like her language Czech. Eva is adopted by a German family. The Werner family is composed of Vater, (father in German), a high official at the Nazi government, Mutter (mother), Elsbeth and Peter, her new adoptive siblings, and their dog, Kaiser. One day, as she is walking back to the house after a picnic with Elsbeth, Eva hears the Czech anthem being sung. Coming closer, she discovers a concentration camp with female prisoners. This brings back memories, enabling Milada to see clearly who she is. Elsbeth explains to her that this is the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and that her Vater is the head of the camp. The Nazis are losing on all fronts and Berlin is encircled by Russian troops. Vater decides to go into hiding and takes Peter with him, while Mutter, Elsbeth, and Eva move to the basement shelter to protect themselves. In May, Soviet Red Army troops come and ask for the documents left by Vater in his office, but Mutter tells them that she is not aware of anything. They leave without causing any harm to the family but tore the house apart, and taking everything in Vater's office. A few days later, Hitler is declared dead and the war is over. Sometime after, representatives from the Red Cross Association comes to the house and announces that Milada's mother is alive and she has launched a search for her daughter. Milada recognizes that she is the person they are looking for. At that moment Eva is Milada again. She is taken back to Czechoslovakia. She meets her mother in Prague, discovering that she was indeed detained in Ravensbr√ºck, a few steps away from the Werner household. Milada also learns sadly that her father and Jaro, along with all the other adult and teenage males in the village were killed by the Nazis on the same day they were separated. Her grandmother died in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp because of her old age. Her best friend was also shot in Poland after she left for the center. Her sister Anechka was adopted into a German family and the Red Cross is looking for her, although it is never revealed whether or not she was returned. Milada's mother was ravaged from harsh conditions of the camp, and after her recovery, move to live with a cousin in Prague. They return to visit Lidice but discover that their house, and pretty much the rest of the village, had been completely razed by the Germans. Milada slowly relearns the Czech language, nearly from scratch. Milada and her mother get closer again as they tell each other what happened during the horrific times of their separation. Finally, Milada manages to recover her true identity and pride.

Retrieved April 2009. Most cities throughout the world produce energy by burning coal, oil and gas, unintentionally emitting carbon. Almost every activity humans do involves burning one of these fossil fuels. To become a zero carbon city, an established modern city must collectively reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to zero and all practices that emit greenhouse gases must cease. Also, renewable energy must supersede other non-renewable energy sources and become the sole source of energy, so a zero-carbon city is a renewable-energy-economy city. This transition which includes decarbonising electricity (increasing the importance of the sources of renewable electricity) and zero-emission transport, is undertaken as a response to climate change. Zero-carbon cities maintain optimal living conditions while eliminating environmental impact. Instead of using established cities, many developers are starting from scratch in order to create a zero-carbon city. This way they can make sure every aspect of a city contributes to it being carbon free. Cities aspiring to be carbon-free There are two places that are prototyped to become zero-carbon cities: Masdar City, United Arab Emirates and Dongtan, China.CCC Newsdesk. (2008, June 4). Eco-cities: Masdar city‚Äôs new eco-model. Retrieved from http://www.climatechangecorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=5361 Malacca also has a stated ambition to become a carbon-free city, with a Low Carbon Cities programme being piloted in Malaysia as of 2014.\\"Low carbon cities are the core of Malaysia's green future\\", The Carbon Trust, Retrieved on 20 January 2015. Once created these cities will become living examples of sustainable development, which demonstrate optimal resource utilization.  Masdar City  The Masdar Initiative is an environmental urban ambition by Foster + Partners to develop a sustainable city where residents would enjoy a carbon and waste-free environment. The project is based on the principles of an ancient walled city, combined with modern alternative energy technologies. Critics say that the city concept appears cold and uninviting, however, this project \\"promises to question conventional urban wisdom at a fundamental level‚Äù. Masdar promises to set new benchmarks for the sustainable city of the future.\\" The city will be entirely self-sustaining Masdar CEO, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber explained, \\"... we are creating a synergetic environment; it is a true alternative energy cluster. Here you will find researchers, students, scientists, business investment professionals, and policy makers all within the same community. It will be a living example of sustainable development that will position Abu Dhabi and Masdar at the forefront of intelligent resource utilization. It will combine the talent, expertise and resources to enable the technological breakthroughs necessary for truly sustainable development.\\" Construction of this large-scale project will occur in two phases. In phase one, a solar photovoltaic power plant will be built as a central energy source. In phase two, urban growth will occur. The site is located in close proximity to Abu Dhabi's transportation infrastructure, which will allow for easy access to and from surrounding communities. An efficient network of rail, road and public transit will link the city to central Abu Dhabi and the international airport. Dongtan Dongtan, China is located at the east end of Chongming and is adjacent to the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve. Seeing as this area is near wetlands, some question its effects on the surrounding environment. The director of the project, Peter Head, insists it will not affect the wetlands.Hart, S. (2007). Zero carbon cities. Architectural Record. 3, 162-164. The developers plan on a fully built city, with 80,000 residents by 2020.Cheng, H. & Hu, Y. (2009). Planning for sustainability in China‚Äôs urban development: Status and challenges for Dongtan eco-city project. Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 12 (1), 119-126. Dongtan development plans include use of the ten principles of eco-cities. Adjacent to booming Shanghai, plans are coming together for the prototypical city of Dongtan, which designers argue would be the world's first truly sustainable new urban development. London-based Arup and the Shanghai Industrial Investment Corporation (SIIC), the city's investment branch, have partnered to create a master plan for Dongtan, an area three quarters the size of Manhattan. The brief calls for integrated sustainable urban planning and design to create a city as close to carbon-neutral as possible within economic constraints. Located in sensitive wetlands on Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River just north of Shanghai, Dongtan's first phase, a marina village of 20,000 inhabitants, will be unveiled at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. By 2020, nearly 80,000 people are expected to inhabit the city's environmentally sustainable neighborhoods. As a strategic partner, Arup is responsible for a range of services, including urban design, sustainable energy management, waste management, renewable energy process implementation, architecture, infrastructure, and even the planning of communities and social structures. Peter Head, director of Arup's sustainable urban design, leads the project for the firm from its London's office (during design, Arup is offsetting the emissions of its team's travel to and from the site in cooperation with emissions brokerage firm CO2e). ‚ÄúRenewable energy will be used to reduce particulate CO2 emissions. Transport vehicles will run on batteries or hydrogen-fuel cells and not use any diesel or petrol, creating a relatively quiet city,‚Äù he explains. Other priorities include recycling organic waste to reduce landfills and generate clean energy. Head insists development won‚Äôt affect the wetlands. ‚ÄúFirst of all, water usually discharged into the river will be collected, treated, and recycled within the city boundaries,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere will be a 2-mile buffer zone of eco-farm between city development and the wetlands.‚Äù While farming is water intensive, relatively small amounts of water reach the plants themselves. Head says Dongtan ‚Äúwill capture and recycle water in the city and use recycled water to grow green vegetables hydroponically. This makes the whole water cycle much more efficient\\". Dongtan is expected to eventually be home to more than 500,000 residents, which is an insignificant number for a country of 1.3 billion people. But the ambitious carbon-neutral experiment of Dongtan is meant to be a model for development worldwide.http://archrecord.construction.com/tech/techFeatures/0703feature-1.asp Initiatives Transport Cars will be banned within the city, instead battery-powered and auto piloted personal rapid transit systems (PRT) will be usedAbbasi, T., Premalatha, M.& Abbasi, S.A.

In both prototypes there will be ideal conditions to encourage walking or cycling. Additionally, both Masdar City and Dongtan will be connected to their larger counterparts via rail or road.

The helmet was made through the use of slivers of boar tusks which were attached to a leather base, padded with felt, in rows. A description of a boar's tusk helmet appears in book ten of Homer's Iliad, as Odysseus is armed for a night raid to be conducted against the Trojans. Fragments of ivory which might have come from helmets of this kind have been discovered on Mycenaean sites (at Dendra, for instance, fragments were found alongside the bronze panoply excavated in 1960) and an ivory plaque, also from a Mycenaean site, represents a helmet of this kind. Although they would not provide as good protection as a metal helmet, they may have been worn by some leaders as a status symbol, or a means of identification. Homer specifies that the helmet given by Meriones to Odysseus was an heirloom, passed down through the generations, a detail which perhaps suggests its value.

According to Orchard Park police, Hassan came to the police station at 6:20 pm on February 12, 2009, the day of the killing, and reported his wife dead. Her body was found at the TV station.Muslim TV exec accused of beheading wife in NY AP, 2009-02-17 Police had previously visited the Hassans' home in response to domestic incidents. They were most recently called to the residence February 6, 2009, the day Hassan was served with divorce papers and an order of protection, where it is reported he was banging on doors and even broke a window. Hassan said in an interview after his arrest that he \\"felt an incredible amount of relief\\" after he killed his wife. \\"I felt like I had escaped from an Al Qaeda terrorist camp and the safest place was the Orchard Park Police Station. I felt safe and secure with them.\\" Hassan's sister-in- law, Asma, the victim's sister in South Africa, said that Asiya was abused, and feared for her life. The divorce petition cited \\"violence and inhuman treatment\\" as the reason. Police reports indicated that Zubair stated her husband's abusive and controlling behavior had begun at least six years earlier. Muzzammil Hassan was arraigned before Village Justice Deborah Chimes and sent to the Erie County Holding Center. Sources claimed to be close to the case said hunting knives were used to commit the crime. Prosecutor Colleen Curtin Gable said Hassan, who is stocky and over 6 feet tall, bought two hunting knives less than an hour before the attack, then parked his SUV out of view at the station, and hid in wait inside the station to await his wife. When Hassan's wife walked through the door, he stabbed her more than 40 times in the face, back, chest, and decapitated her, some of which was caught on surveillance video. Their 4- and 6-year-old children, plus a teenage son from one of his two previous marriages, were left buckled into car seats outside in a van during the murder. Hassan, who dismissed four defense attorneys and acted as his own lawyer during the trial, used his two-hour closing remarks telling the jury how he was a slave to his wife's rages. However, Hassan never produced any witnesses or evidence to substantiate his abuse claims, while prosecutors cited numerous police reports filed by his wife and her medical records which testified to her being the battered spouse. The New York state jury convicted Muzzammil \\"Mo\\" Hassan of second-degree murder after an hour of deliberation. Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita said the sentence was the maximum amount that could be imposed under state law, and that Hassan will not be \\"eligible to talk to the parole board\\" for 25 years. \\"The chances of him getting out before his sentence is completed is not going to happen.\\" A protection order on behalf of Hassan's two children was also issued by Erie County Judge Thomas Franczyk.

On Monday, January 24, Hassan gained permission from Judge Thomas Franczyk to represent himself after repeatedly trying to dismiss his own defense attorney, Jeremy Schwartz. Hassan did admit, however, that he had beaten his wife repeatedly between December 2007 and March 2008. On January 24, Hassan asked for the case to be dismissed, citing lack of evidence by the prosecution. This request was denied. On the same day, text messages between Hassan and his wife from the date of the murder were released as evidence. In an unusual turn, Hassan asked to represent himself. After first denying him, Erie County Court Judge Thomas Franczyk eventually granted his request. He testified on the 27th and 28 January, with his former defense attorney Jeremy Schwartz acting as his legal adviser. Hassan is currently incarcerated in Clinton Correctional Facility. His parole hearing date is set for October 2033.

Born in Johnson City, Tennessee, he batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Bowman was signed by the New York Giants as an amateur in 1956 after he attended East Tennessee State University. His professional career would encompass 14 seasons, although he spent only two full campaigns (1962‚Äì63) in the big leagues. As a member of the San Francisco Giants, he served as the primary backup to the club's regular shortstop, Jos√© Pag√°n, and second baseman, Chuck Hiller. He was a member of the 1962 National League champion Giants. On August 23, his only MLB home run off Al Jackson of the New York Mets at the Polo Grounds was a key blow in San Francisco's 2‚Äì1 victory. He also appeared in two games of the Giants' tie-breaker series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and in two games of the 1962 World Series against the New York Yankees. In the latter series, Bowman batted once against Marshall Bridges in Game 4 at Yankee Stadium and flied out to right fielder Roger Maris. Bowman remained with the Giants through the 1963 season, when he appeared in a career-high 81 games, including 26 as the starting shortstop and another two as the starting second baseman. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Braves in a seven-player deal whose principals included Felipe Alou, Ed Bailey, Bob Shaw and Del Crandall. But the Braves sent Bowman to Triple-A in 1964, and he never appeared again in the major leagues. Altogether, he collected 39 hits during his big-league career, including four doubles, two triples and his one home run. He batted .190 and collected ten runs batted in. He retired in 1969. Ernie Bowman died at his home in Johnson City on August 4, 2019.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 15, 2009. The episode was written by both Billy Kimball and longtime Simpsons writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, and directed by Chris Clements. In the episode, Homer leaves Maggie on the doorstep of a convent, but when she disappears, Lisa goes undercover as a nun to solve the mystery and find her. Meanwhile, Homer tries to keep Maggie's disappearance a secret from Marge, who was temporarily blinded while watching a solar eclipse. Plot The Simpsons are excited for a solar eclipse over Springfield. After Homer's camera obscura breaks due to Bart's antics, Marge gives hers to Homer. As the family expresses delight at seeing the eclipse, Marge takes a peek, which blinds her. Dr. Hibbert informs the family that Marge's eyes must be covered for two weeks, and she must not be put under any stress. After a rat infestation, Homer takes Maggie and Santa's Little Helper to the store so he can get rat poison. Bickering between the baby and the dog causes the family's car to fall off a bridge on the way back home. Homer tries to get them all across a lake in a small boat (a reference to the fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle). He first takes Maggie across and puts her on the doorstep of a convent, where the nuns take Maggie in and refuse to give her back. While Homer and Bart hide the truth from Marge, Lisa goes undercover as a nun and infiltrates the convent. When Mother Superior refuses to tell her where Maggie is, Lisa discovers that they are seeking a jewel. Lisa's first clue is to \\"seek God with heart and soul,\\" which she correctly interprets as playing a few measures of the song by the same name on the convent's organ, activating a Rube Goldberg contraption. She next is told to find the \\"biggest man-made ring\\" in Springfield; at first, she assumes it is circular rings, but she learns the biggest ring is the Springfield Bell Tower. Arriving there, she meets Comic Book Guy and Principal Skinner, who tell her that St. Teresa of √Åvila had a deathbed vision of a jewel that would bring peace and harmony to the world. Comic Book Guy tells her that the gem will be revealed on the first full moon after a solar eclipse, which is that night. However, the bell is actually papier-m√¢ch√©, so Lisa and Comic Book Guy conclude that the biggest \\"ring\\" in Springfield is the RING in the Springfield Sign. At the Springfield Sign, they are met by Mr. Burns and Smithers, who are also looking for the gem. Lisa finds writing on the letters of Springfield (together saying \\"Great crimes kill holy sage\\") and unscrambles a message that reads \\"Regally, the rock gem is Lisa\\". Mr. Burns takes the others back to the convent where Lisa announces that she is the gem child. However, Mother Superior tells her that the gem child is Maggie and rearranges the message into \\"It's really Maggie, Sherlock\\". Maggie is put on a throne, causing a light to hit her which makes a rainbow that brings peace all over Springfield. Marge, however, inexplicably bursts in and takes Maggie back. Her eyes are healed upon seeing Maggie. She refuses to give up Maggie for the peace of Springfield. On the way home she asks Homer if she was being selfish, but he says that he found a replacement for Maggie; Bart assumes the role of the \\"gem child\\", but due to the reflections of his unruly personality, he turns it into a living Hell. Cultural references *The main plot of this episode parodies National Treasure and The Da Vinci Code. For example, the bell in the tower turning out to be the wrong one was a scene in National Treasure, regarding the Liberty Bell. For The Da Vinci Code, the Holy Grail turned out to be Mary Magdalene, and Sophie was the last remaining heir to the Christ bloodline; whereas in this episode, the gem turns out to be Maggie. In another reference to The Da Vinci Code, Mr. Burns calls Smithers his loyal albino servant, a reference to Silas from The Da Vinci Code. The large portion of the first part of the episode involving the rats was an homage to Ratatouille. The song that is played when Lisa walks into the monastery is \\"O Fortuna\\". Bart turning everything to Hell is an homage to The Omen. The title references the movie Gone Baby Gone. *The clue \\"Great crimes kill holy sage\\" is quite possibly a reference to the fallout from the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases. Reception The episode was well received by television critics. Robert Canning of IGN said: \\"as entertaining as the story was, it would not have made a difference if it weren't just as equally funny. I laughed throughout the retelling of the legend of St. Theresa, which included pirate nuns and a fake war for independence. Mr. Burns referring to Smithers as his albino was another hilarious bit. Overall, it was the combination of a fully engaging story and great laughs that made \\"Gone, Maggie, Gone\\" another winner for The Simpsons in their post-hi-def series run.\\" Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- stating, \\"It's been a long time since the show has done something fresh, and I think this is about as good as it's gonna get for a while‚Äîeven if the episode took a while to get going.\\" TV Verdict's Erich Asperschlager said: \\"Part Da Vinci Code, part National Treasure, and part Professor Layton, ‚ÄòGone Maggie Gone‚Äô shakes up the Simpsons formula in a fun way by introducing one of those American-history-conspiracy-theory-cult- mysteries that are so popular with the kids, as well as those brain-bending- word-and-logic-puzzles that aren‚Äôt. ‚ÄòGone Maggie Gone‚Äô is one of the best so far this season.\\" The episode was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series. It was also nominated for the Annie Award for \\"Best Writing in an Animated Television Production.\\" Billy Kimball and Ian Maxtone-Graham were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the Animation category in 2010 for writing the episode. The Simpsons was the only show to be nominated in the category, with the other nominated episodes being \\"The Burns and the Bees\\", \\"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\\", \\"Take My Life, Please\\" and \\"Wedding for Disaster\\" (the winner).

These procedures include screening activities which include but are not limited to: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, and report cards); hearing screening (at a minimum of kindergarten, special ungraded classes, first, second, third, seventh, and eleventh grades); vision screening (every grade level); motor screening; and speech and language screening. In schools which have a Pre-Referral, Child- Study, Early Intervening or Instructional Support Team, the above screening activities may lead to consideration by the teams to move the next level of screening activities.

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, there are fewer than 250 students enrolled in K-12. The senior class of 2010 had 35 students. The class of 2011 has 28 members. Enrollment in Salisbury-Elk Lick School District is projected to continue to decline by 50 more students by 2015. The administrative infrastructure and mandate related costs per pupil are very high. With limited local resources, opportunities for students are limited. A study was done in 2004, examining consolidating Salisbury-Elk Lick School District with neighboring Meyersdale Area School District. It found considerable savings would be achieved by both communities. Consolidation with Rockwood Area School District was also examined and would have achieved cost savings.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007 Part 2 page 89. The study noted that consolidation could significantly decrease administrative costs for both communities while improving offerings to students. Consolidation of school district administrations does not require the consolidation of schools.School District Consolidation Fact Sheet These savings could be redirected to improving lagging student achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing property taxes.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009 As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools will continue to rise. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts. New York: Standard & Poor‚Äôs School Evaluation Services. 2007, p. 6. A school district consolidation study was conducted by the Pennsylvania Economy League in 1994. It looked at a consolidation of Salisbury-Elk Lick with the neighboring Meyersdale Area School District. The study was performed at the districts' request. One finding from the study was that if the districts were merged in 1992-93, the local tax effort required of the merged district would have fallen in between the two districts. It was estimated that Salisbury's tax rate would decrease by 17 mills in the 1992-93 school year, and the Meyersdale's tax rate would increase by 8 mills in the 1992- 93 school year. The merger did not take place, despite Meyersdale's desire to proceed with it.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee report on public school consolidation, June 1, 2007. Governance The school district is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

As compared to sand casting, this process has better dimensional accuracy, a higher productivity rate, and lower labor requirements. It is used for small to medium parts that require high precision.. Shell molding was developed as a manufacturing process during the mid-20th century in Germany. It was invented by German engineer Johannes Croning. Shell mold casting is a metal casting process similar to sand casting, in that molten metal is poured into an expendable mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal piece in the shape of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable complex geometries to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, dump box, and molten metal. Shell mold casting allows the use of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals, most commonly using cast iron, carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and copper alloys. Typical parts are small- to-medium in size and require high accuracy, such as gear housings, cylinder heads, connecting rods, and lever arms. The shell mold casting process consists of the following steps: Pattern creation - A two-piece metal pattern is created in the shape of the desired part, typically from iron or steel. Other materials are sometimes used, such as aluminum for low volume production or graphite for casting reactive materials. Mold creation - First, each pattern half is heated to 175-370 ¬∞C (350-700 ¬∞F) and coated with a lubricant to facilitate removal. Next, the heated pattern is clamped to a dump box, which contains a mixture of sand and a resin binder. The dump box is inverted, allowing this sand-resin mixture to coat the pattern. The heated pattern partially cures the mixture, which now forms a shell around the pattern. Each pattern half and surrounding shell is cured to completion in an oven and then the shell is ejected from the pattern. Mold assembly - The two shell halves are joined together and securely clamped to form the complete shell mold. If any cores are required, they are inserted prior to closing the mold. The shell mold is then placed into a flask and supported by a backing material. Pouring - The mold is securely clamped together while the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the gating system and fills the mold cavity. Cooling - After the mold has been filled, the molten metal is allowed to cool and solidify into the shape of the final casting. Casting removal - After the molten metal has cooled, the mold can be broken and the casting removed. Trimming and cleaning processes are required to remove any excess metal from the feed system and any sand from the mold. Examples of shell molded items include gear housings, cylinder heads and connecting rods. It is also used to make high-precision molding cores. Process The process of creating a shell mold consists of six steps:. #Fine silica sand that is covered in a thin (3‚Äì6%) thermosetting phenolic resin and liquid catalyst is dumped, blown, or shot onto a hot pattern. The pattern is usually made from cast iron and is heated to 230 to 315 ¬∞C (450 to 600 ¬∞F). The sand is allowed to sit on the pattern for a few minutes to allow the sand to partially cure. #The pattern and sand are then inverted so the excess sand drops free of the pattern, leaving just the \\"shell\\". Depending on the time and temperature of the pattern the thickness of the shell is . #The pattern and shell together are placed in an oven to finish curing the sand. The shell now has a tensile strength of . #The hardened shell is then stripped from the pattern. #Two or more shells are then combined, via clamping or gluing using a thermoset adhesive, to form a mold. This finished mold can then be used immediately or stored almost indefinitely. #For casting the shell mold is placed inside a flask and surrounded with shot, sand, or gravel to reinforce the shell.. Wednesday, 12 December 2018 The machine that is used for this process is called a shell molding machine. It heats the pattern, applies the sand mixture, and bakes the shell. center Details Setup and production of shell mold patterns takes weeks, after which an output of 5‚Äì50 pieces/hr-mold is attainable. Common materials include cast iron, aluminum and copper alloys.. Aluminum and magnesium products average about as a normal limit, but it is possible to cast items in the range. The small end of the limit is . Depending on the material, the thinnest cross-section castable is . The minimum draft is 0.25 to 0.5 degrees. Typical tolerances are 0.005 mm/mm or in/in because the sand compound is designed to barely shrink and a metal pattern is used. The cast surface finish is 0.3‚Äì4.0 micrometers (50‚Äì150 Œºin) because a finer sand is used. The resin also assists in forming a very smooth surface. The process, in general, produces very consistent castings from one casting to the next. The sand-resin mix can be recycled by burning off the resin at high temperatures.  Advantages and disadvantages  ;Advantages *Shell molding can be completely automated for mass production. * The high productivity, low labor costs, good surface finishes, and precision of the process can more than pay for itself if it reduces machining costs. * There are few problems due to gases, because of the absence of moisture in the shell, and the little gas that is still present easily escapes through the thin shell. When the metal is poured some of the resin binder burns out on the surface of the shell, which makes shaking out easy. * Complex shapes and fine details can be formed with very good surface finish, high production rate, low labor cost (if automated). * Low tooling cost, Little scrap generated. * Very large parts and complex shapes can be produced. * Many material options. * Low tooling and equipment cost. * Scrap can be recycled. * Short lead time possible. ;Disadvantages * The gating system must be part of the pattern because the entire mold is formed from the pattern, which can be expensive. * The resin for the sand is expensive, although not much is required because only a shell is being formed. *High equipment cost. * Poor material strength. * High porosity possible. * Secondary machining often required. * High labor cost if done manually.  Applications Cylinder heads, connecting rods, Engine blocks and manifolds, machine bases.

The chart is based on the Bible, thus a chronological history of the Bible is presented on its first pages, that eventually merges with secular history on the pages following. The original version by Presbyterian missionary Sebastian C. Adams was published in 1871 and spanned to his present day in the 19th century. The chart has been later updated to continue up to the 21st century. Format and design The chart maintains a Victorian design (even in updated versions) and is thoroughly accompanied by illustrations. As indicators of time, all through is the chart divided into big black posts which mark centuries and thin red lines which mark decades (with very thin red lines occasionally marking single years). Additionally, big red crosses indicate great persecutions of Christians at the times of the Roman Empire and small red crosses stand for each of the crusades. Red circles indicate ecumenical councils. Also, question marks indicate uncertainties (they are mostly seen at the beginning of the timechart, where the certainty of events and the accuracy of dates are most disputed). The nation streams are segmented into different colours, each colour indicating the reign of a particular ruler or a certain type of government. In some cases, prime ministers are shown in the lower half of nation streams and presidents in the upper half. Coloured scrolls and strips near the top of the chart stand for important people other than the rulers and other political leaders shown on the nation streams. These streams grow wider or thinner in accordance to historical context. Some streams divide to indicate a split in the nation (e.g. to indicate the independence of a state) or flow into others to illustrate its conquest, invasion, or acquisition by such other nation. Suzi Feay of The Independent describes the chart's peculiar design for a peculiarly big scope of human history as something that \\"resembles an unusually complicated digestive system, with its lines, loops, bulges and branches.\\" Content The chart begins with Adam and Eve and advances with their genealogy. At a point of this genealogy, after the deluge (which is indicated by a black line), the chart is divided in two: the upper part continuing with the genealogy and the lower broader part showing the origin of the first nations as men supposedly separated because of the confusion of tongues following the construction of the Tower of Babel. The link between the genealogy upwards and the nation streams downwards is presented by recognizing the founders of each nation as specific people from the genealogy, in accordance to certain interpretations of The Bible. At certain points of the chart, large percentages of space are occupied by big empires such as the Babylonian Empire (under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II), the Persian Empire, the Macedonian Empire, and the Roman Empire, which, at one page, occupies almost the entire part of the chart used for nation streams. At the fall of Rome, the empire's colossal nation stream is divided into many smaller streams of Barbaric Kingdoms. As history advances, the nation streams, being first wavy, gradually straighten up, probably to illustrate how history becomes more certain and undisputed as it narrows down to the present. The independence of many colonies is clearly shown as big nation streams standing for colonial empires split into several smaller streams. World War I and World War II are indicated by bold black lines behind the streams with a thickness determined by their duration.

The climate in Khabab clearly shows the seasons sequence, summer the air tends to be heat during the day with a beautiful night with a dry breeze, and autumn begins with yellow leaves and cooler weather followed by cold winters, especially in the months of December and January and February, where spring begins with March. Rainfall average ~250 mm (till year 2000), temperature Min, Max (-4 Winter)-(38 Summer) C temperature average (4.4 Winter)-(30 Summer) C Economy The people in Khabab are farmers basically (as the most of southern Syria) reliance on agriculture was the only source of livelihood. In recent years, people's dependence on agriculture has remarkably dropped down for several reasons, including: * Dependency on rainfall and this affects the amount of the crop by the amount of rainfall and the most important rainfed crops are wheat, barley and lentils. irrigation agriculture become commonly used for vegetables as: tomatoes, watermelon, carrots, etc., and common fruit trees as: grapes, olives, almonds became an important crop. * Most of the residents are employees in the public sector or the private sector, therefore, now monthly salary is the basic income source. * Youth migration to the main cities, especially the capital, Damascus, and out-migration to the Persian Gulf region or Europe or America or Australia, and the youth generation in the town are no longer interested in following in the life pattern of their parents and grandparents, concerning agriculture. * The dispute over large areas of the town between the residents and the Bedouin who used to work for the residents of Khabab, and moved to the area between 1910 and 1918, this issues affected the agricultural activity, but the problem of the land has not been solved yet, and this is what makes many residents do not trust the future of agriculture in the town of Khabab anymore * That a number of people head to work in the areas of commercial and industrial. Education and culture The literacy rate at of the highest levels in Syria, to the attention of the people in education, there are a large number of distinctive competencies of the people of the village .. The school was that follow the Archdiocese and the monastery the most important reasons to encourage the education and science in khabab as well as the surrounding villages. There are seven schools in the town, distributed as follows: kindergarten, two schools of basic education (primary) and four of middle and high stage.

Many radio transmissions have also vanished from the airwaves. After listening to a talk by a brilliant but eccentric cosmologist, Dr Karl Gustav Friedmann, they realise that his theory about the so-called Xi Effect may explain their observations. The Effect postulates a vastly higher order of space-time called Xi-space, which has altered, causing slowly increasing effects on the local universe. These effects will cause galaxies to collapse and shrink rather than recede as they normally do. Eventually, the theory is proven as it becomes fact, and the shrinkage become measurable. Electromagnetic radiation is progressively eliminated and even colours begin to disappear. Darkness falls upon the Earth and there is total panic.

Traphagen House, Duluth, Minnesota (1892)Oliver Green Traphagen (3 September 1854 - 21 October 1932) was an American architect who designed many notable buildings in Duluth, Minnesota, during the late 19th century and in the Territory of Hawaii during the early 20th century. Among his most famous landmarks are the Oliver G. Traphagen House in Duluth, called the Redstone, and the Moana Hotel in Honolulu, both of which are on the National Register of Historic Places, as are several other buildings he designed. Biography He was born on 3 September 1854 in Tarrytown, New York. In the 1870s Traphagen moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, with his parents where he worked as a carpenter, and later as an apprentice to the architect George Wirth. He moved north to Duluth in 1882, and soon became one of the city's first major architects. The 1880s were boom times in Duluth; the population was 30,000 in 1887 compared with 13,000 in 1883.\\"Duluth's legacy: Volume 1: Architecture\\", text by James Allen Scott; photography and graphic design by John R. Ulven, Jr.; ill. by Robert T. Calton. (the City of Duluth through the Office of the Dept. of Research & Planning, 1974) p. 7 Over the next fifteen years, either on his own or in partnership with Wirth (1884-1886) and later Francis W. Fitzpatrick (1889-1896), Traphagen designed buildings for both public and private owners, such as the First National Bank (1888), Turner Hall (1888), Wieland Block (1889), City Hall and Jail (1889), Fire Station No. 1 (1889), First Presbyterian Church (1891), and Duluth Central High School (1892). Many of Traphagen's designs show the influence of the Richardsonian Romanesque style that was popular at the time. Palama Fire Station, Honolulu, Hawaii (1901)Because his daughter's health required a warmer climate, the family relocated to the soon-to-be-annexed Republic of Hawaii in October 1897.Wilcox 1972, p. 7 Thanks to his previous work in Duluth he soon became \\"the most prolific and highly regarded architect in town.\\"Wilcox 1972, p. 8 He designed the first building in the islands with a passenger elevator, the Judd Building (1898); the first hotel on Waikiki Beach, the Moana (1901); and the first public crematory in the Islands, at Oahu Cemetery (1906). As in Duluth, he also designed public works, such as the Kakaako Pumping Station (1900), Palama Fire Station (1901), and the Hawaiian State Archives Building (1906). Two of his more exceptional buildings have not survived: the classical-style Hackfeld & Co. building downtown (1902) and the four-story James B. Castle home on Waikiki Beach. Among the last buildings he designed in Hawaii was the Punahou School president's home, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2007. In 1907, he moved to Alameda, California, where he retired in 1925. He died on 21 October 1932 in Alameda, California.

It is used most often in the medical field, but is also commonly used in the fields of electrophysiology and bioengineering. From Prof. Peter N. Steinmetz's \\"Bioelectricity and Bioinstrumentation\\" Definitions of the term are inconsistent; there are three most commonly accepted definitions. Depending upon the medical text used, a macroshock is either: * A strong electric shock resulting from current that has passed through the trunk or head, with contact to the source through intact skin. Under this definition, a macroshock is almost always lethal due to causing ventricular fibrillation of the heart. Dorlands Medical Dictionary * The passage of current from one part of the body to another, especially from arm to arm and therefore through the heart. By this definition, the magnitude of the current itself (in Amperes) is the most important factor. In general, the greater the current, the more dangerous a shock is and the more likely it is to be lethal. Therefore, a high-voltage, low-current shock is not dangerous, but a low-voltage, high- current shock may cause significant harm or death. From Prof. Peter N. Steinmetz's \\"Bioelectricity and Bioinstrumentation\\" * The passage of current between two different areas of skin. Whether or not the head or heart is involved is not considered in this definition. Therefore, such a shock might not be lethal, although it may cause severe damage via electrical breakdown of the skin. Medical Devices: Use and Safety By Bertil Jacobson, Alan Murray pg.33 preview in Google books Sources of macroshock Possible sources of macroshock include: poorly designed or malfunctioning electrophysiology equipment, Lightning, damaged power cords or other electrical hazards around the household, downed power lines, high-voltage electrical equipment such as transformer stations and other industrial electrical equipment, and malfunctioning electrical or electricity-using mechanical equipment capable of delivering a strong current, or which operates at a high voltage.

Although most of the printing presses produced by Adana were aimed at hobby printers, they were frequently put to commercial use. Adanas are still to be found throughout the world in the hands of colleges, enthusiasts and professional printers. Caslon Limited manufactured machines after a takeover of the company in 1987. The earliest Adana models were flat- bed presses but they were to become most famous for their \\"Eight-Five\\" and other vertical platen presses. History of the Adana Founded as The Adana Agency in 1922 by Donald Aspinall, the company's assets were bought by Frederick Ayers in 1940 and the company was relaunched as Adana (Printing Machines) Limited in 1946. In 1987 the assets were again sold, this time to Caslon Limited who continued to produce a small number of presses for a further six years. Throughout the years, both the company and its presses were usually referred to as \\"Adana\\" or \\"The Adana\\". Donald Aspinall Donald Affleck Aspinall was born in South Kensington, London, in 1899. Unusually for the time, his parents separated, and his father Herbert left the seven-year- old Donald and his brothers, John and Cecil, in the sole care of their mother, Lilian. In 1917 Donald served in World War I, presumably having lied about his age. Later that year he returned from the front suffering from shell-shock. While recovering, he began working on the design of a small flat-bed printing press. He advertised it in Model Engineer magazine in 1918 and was overwhelmed by the response. The teenage Aspinall is said to have tried to hand the money over to the local constabulary, rather than face the prospect of fulfilling so many orders. He was persuaded that this was not a wise move by an understanding policeman, and he eventually produced enough machines to fill the orders. After losing his job five years later, Aspinall founded the Adana Agency and turned his hobby into a business. From premises in Twickenham, he began selling flat-bed wooden presses to hobby printers. The competitive pricing and self-inking system ensured its success. In 1928 he married Dorothy Lucas. They later had two children, Robert and Diana. The company was going from strength to strength, with new models launched regularly, showrooms opening in London and Manchester, and official distributors enlisted in New York and Perth, Western Australia. A decade later, the company's fortunes declined. In 1939 Aspinall suffered the first of several strokes and the economic pressures of World War II left the Adana Agency in meltdown. After a meeting of the creditors, the company's assets were sold to Frederick Ayers. Until his death in 1948, Aspinall continued to correspond with Frederick Ayers, sharing advice and ideas for new designs. Aspinall's engineering achievements are sometimes dismissed as he borrowed so heavily from American designs, but his business acumen and talent for re-working existing ideas (such as creating a revolving ink-disk for his flat-bed presses) are widely acknowledged. Frederick Ayers Engineer Frederick Ayers became involved with the company in 1923 when his company started supplying parts to the fledgling Adana Agency. He became friends with Aspinall, and began to offer design advice. As one of the company's creditors, he was able to purchase the assets cheaply in 1940 when the company became insolvent. The war years Like many others, the company was effectively on hold during World War II, with a skeleton staff supplying only parts and sundries. They were asked to supply small flat-bed presses for the Resistance movement in Europe but little else happened until 1945 when production began again on a very limited basis. Ongoing rationing meant raw materials were in short supply and it wasn't until around 1950 that the company was able to trade at full capacity again. Post-war expansion By 1952, Adana had distributors in Italy, Turkey, Greece, India, Finland and Canada. They continued to expand until Adanas were available in nearly 100 countries around the world. The end of Adana There were unavoidable price increases as parts and labour became more expensive. Adana presses were virtually indestructible and the company had a policy of supplying parts, so there was little incentive to buy new when second-hand presses were readily available. Lithography was drawing away much of the commercial market and letterpress printing (along with many crafts) became unfashionable as the 1980s brought new technology into homes. The company was wound down and the assets sold to Caslon Limited who continued to produce the more popular presses until 1999 when the last Eight-Five was sold in Japan. Caslon still supply parts and refurbish old Adanas to new condition. Rebirth of the Eight-Five A resurgence of interest in letterpress printing as a hobby, and as a premium commercial product, resulted in the reintroduction of the Adana \\"Eight-Five\\" in 2016, when production of the machine was restarted. The basic design has been modified to produce a thicker body shell, capable of achieving the deeper letterpress impression now fashionable. The relaunched press is known as the \\"85C\\". Other activities Adana also cast type and published many books. Their magazine-style catalogues (containing practical printing advice alongside price lists) such as Popular Printing and Printcraft were much loved and have become highly collectable. The name The official story behind the name Adana states that Donald Aspinall named the company after the city of Adana in Turkey, having served there during World War I. In his book on Adanas, printing historian Bob Richardson notes that Aspinall's army unit never saw action in Turkey and relates another theory: > Donald's son Robert suggested recently that his father had simply used his > initials, together with an extra letter from his first and last names (A and > N), and juggled them to create the word ADANA. It was short, easy to > remember and had a pleasant, rather exotic sound.Richardson, B: The Adana > Connection, page 17. British Printing Society, 1997. Even if he had served in Turkey, it seems unlikely that Aspinall would choose a name that recalled the military service that so traumatised him as a young man. It is possible that his war trauma was a result of witnessing the Armenian Genocide; Adana previously had a very large Armenian population. It is also possible that the company created a fictional back-story that was more satisfying than the reality. Adana is known to have fictionalised other aspects of the company's history for marketing purposes.

During that election, incumbent Democrat John Street sought to defeat his Republican challenger Sam Katz. Philadelphia is predominantly Democratic, but early polls showed Katz with a small lead. Twenty-seven days prior to the election, the FBI revealed that it was investigating Street for corruption, but polls showed that the public supported Street more after the scandal broke. Hill attempts to investigate how Street turned the corruption scandal into an advantage. The film is named after Lincoln Steffens‚Äô 1904 book, The Shame of the Cities, which sought to expose the wrongdoing of public officials in cities across the United States.  Plot Summary  Twenty-seven days before the election, an FBI bug was found in the mayor‚Äôs office. When asked about the bug, the FBI admitted that Street was under investigation. The discovery at first seemed like a death knell to the Street campaign and a near certain victory for Katz. But Street and his supporters argued that the FBI investigation was an instance of institutional racial prejudice, polarizing the campaign. Moreover, Street successfully reoriented the campaign away from local issues and towards a referendum on the locally-unpopular, Republican-controlled federal government. As a result, Street won re-election by a sixteen-point margin even as his closest supporters were indicted.‚Äú‚ÄôShame of a City‚Äô Offers Inside Look at Fractious 2003 Mayoral Election,‚Äù The Evening Bulletin, April 3, 2006 In The Shame of the Cities, Lincoln Steffens claimed‚Äîa century ago!‚Äîthat Philadelphia was ‚Äúcorrupt and contented [with the corruption].‚Äù Emphasizing the perspective of the Katz campaign during its final months, Hill seeks to argue that Philadelphia remains much the same.‚ÄúRoll ‚Äòem‚Ä¶,‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 5, 2006Political Ties,‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, August 20, 2006 Media attention The film won ‚ÄúBest Feature-Length Film‚Äù at the 2006 Philadelphia Film Festival's Festival of Independents and was reviewed positively by the Philadelphia Inquirer.http://www.phillyfilmfest.org Shame of a City would be shown at‚Äîamong other places‚Äîthe National Constitution Center, and be referenced by name in five successive issues of Philadelphia magazine. Hill was interviewed on MSNBC about the documentary.Imus in the Morning,\\" April 26, 2007 Selected Quotes Political impact The timing of the documentary's initial release benefited reform-minded city council member Michael Nutter, who was attempting to succeed Street as the Democratic nominee for mayor.‚ÄúHill: Players Remain the Same,‚Äù Metro, March 27, 2007 Nutter's primary opponents were Congressmen Bob Brady and Chaka Fattah, two Street supporters portrayed negatively in Hill‚Äôs movie. After receiving Hill‚Äôs endorsement, Nutter himself screened The Shame of a City five times to sold- out audiences, using it to raise money and awareness. The DVD release was also timed to coincide with the primary election cycle, reminding voters of the previous elections' controversies. Although he began as underdog, Nutter would eventually win the May 2007 (Democratic) primary and then annihilate his (Republican) opponent in the general election. The Shame of a City also provided an introduction to a Katz campaign consultant, Carl Singley, whose strongly positive appearance in the movie briefly made him the focus of an early, informal city-wide campaign for him to run for mayor.‚ÄúBit Part Could Be Singley‚Äôs Big Break,‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, June 22, 2006‚ÄúCarl Singley Loud and Clear,‚Äù Philadelphia magazine, November 2006 Singley declined to run.‚ÄúFormer Street Ally to Eschew Mayoral Run,‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 7, 2006 References  Specific Citations   General Sources  * ‚ÄúA Backroom Look at Katz vs. Street,‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 31, 2006 External links * Category:2006 films Category:Documentary films about Philadelphia Category:Documentary films about American politicians Category:Politics of Pennsylvania Category:2006 documentary films ","title":"The Shame of a City"},{"id":"21586713","text":"The Positive Quotations line is an inspirational book series published by Fairview Press.

Chopawamsic was a seat of the Mason family. History After the death of George Mason I, his eldest son George Mason II sold his father's Accokeek plantation and relocated to a property along Chopawamsic Creek that he referred to as Chopawamsic, which means ‚ÄúIsolated Lodge‚Äù in Algonquian. Chopawamsic consisted of more than . George Mason II built his manor along Chopawamsic Creek using blocks of local sandstone. Mason planted an orchard and tobacco and raised sheep and cattle. Like his father, George Mason III amassed vast land holdings in Stafford, Fauquier, Prince William, and Fairfax counties. Most of his land holdings were leased out as small farms with the rent paid in tobacco. His other sources of income included a fishing business and a ferry service across Occoquan River. A few years after his marriage to Ann Thomson in 1721, Mason moved his family to Charles County, Maryland. Chopawamsic was used as an occasional residence until Mason's death in 1735 when his widow and children, including George Mason IV, returned to live there. Ann Thomson Mason chose Chopawamsic as her dower after her husband's death and managed Mason family interests from the estate for the remainder of her life. George Mason IV spent his early adolescence and began his early education at Chopawamsic and resided there until the age of 24 when he moved to present-day Fairfax County. Stevens Thomson Mason, son of Thomson Mason, who was first Attorney of the Bar in Dumfries, was born at Chopawamsic in 1760. Thomson Mason and his family resided at Chopawamsic where most of his children were born and later also at Raspberry Plain in Loudoun County. The large sandstone manor at Chopawamsic did not survive the American Civil War. In 1942, much of the area along Chopawamsic Creek that once belonged to the Chopawamsic estate was taken over by the United States Department of Defense to create Marine Corps Base Quantico.

Citizen Chauvelin lays a trap for his long-standing nemesis Sir Percy Blakeney (Barry K. Barnes) by kidnapping his wife (Sophie Stewart).BFI.org Plot summary In France, The Terror is in full sway under Robespierre, who sends former allies and friends to the guillotine. Jean Tallien and his lover, Theresa Cobarrus, fear that Tallien will be taken in one of these purges before the time is right to bring Robespierre down and end the horror. Although Sir Percy Blakeney, the Scarlet Pimpernel, has returned to England, the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel continues to rescue victims of the Revolution. Robespierre threatens Chauvelin with execution unless he can snare Blakeney and bring him to justice. Meanwhile, Blakeney has promised his beloved wife, Marguerite, who is expecting their first child, that he will not return to France. Acting as Chauvelin's agent, Cobarrus succeeds in kidnapping Lady Blakeney and brings her to Paris, where she is put on trial and convicted. Percy and his men rescue Marguerite and De Marre, a former ally of Robespierre. They stop at an inn for supper, and De Marre asks Percy to repeating his famous poem: ‚ÄúThey seek him here, They seek him there, Those Frenchies seek him everywhere. Is he in Heaven? Is he in Hell?

As bait, a belle. His pretty spouse, I grieve to tell. But I never dreamed that I should trap The spouse, the mouse, and the gang as well.‚Äù Percy draws pistol and points it at Chauvelin's heart, but Chauvelin's soldiers, who have surrounded the inn, point their muskets through the windows, targeting Marguerite. Chauvelin agrees to let Marguerite go with Andrew. Percy pulls down the chandelier and he and the gang escape in the dark. Wounded, Andrew comes to the rendezvous with the news that Marguerite is again a prisoner. After long thought, says he is playing his last card. Robespierre orders Marguerite's execution and warns Chauvelin he is on borrowed time. He gives Chauvelin a list of the next purge of members of the Convention instructions to be sure they are all at the session. After Chauvelin leaves, Robespierre observes to his secretary, de Calmet, that he trusts no one‚Äîexcept de Calmet. At the League's hiding place, Percy introduces de Calmet as the bravest member of the League. De Calmet brings the list of names and the news that Marguerite is to be executed at noon the next day. ‚ÄúI can save my wife only if I save France,‚Äù Percy declares. In disguise, Percy comes to Tallien and Cobarrus and shows Tallien the list. France is sick of assassination, ready for new leaders. Tallien rushes out to rally supporters; Percy tells Cobarrus that she is Tallien's courage. Knowing that Robespierre plans to arrest her. Percy comes to her in an officer's uniform, and tells her to write a letter. In the Assembly, Robespierre begins to denounce his 20 targets. Cobarrus's note tells Tallien that she has been arrested. It rouses him to denounce Robespierre as ‚Äúthe new Cromwell‚Äù. The Convention responds with cheers. Percy appears at the prison to rescue Marguerite, supposedly bearing an order from Robespierre. Chauvelin stops them at the gate. As crowds descend on the prison crying ‚ÄúDown with Robespierre‚Äù, Percy claims Chauvelin as his prisoner. On the way home to England, where he hopes to give Chauvelin a new perspective, Percy asks what slow, lingering torture they might inflict on him. Marguerite suggests that Percy teach him to play cricket. Cast * Barry K.

It was built on the grounds of the older Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain- en-Laye, which became known as the Ch√¢teau-Vieux (Old Ch√¢teau). Construction General plan with the Ch√¢teau-Vieux on the left and the Ch√¢teau-Neuf on the right, engraving by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau (1576) The central building, on the edge of the terrace, was ordered in 1556 by Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici and was built by Philibert de l'Orme. Called in its day la maison du th√©√¢tre (the theater house), a succession of terraces and stairs gave access to the baignerie (from French baigner, \\"to bathe\\") on the Seine. From the beginning of his reign in 1593, King Henry IV would come to Saint-Germain because he took pleasure in the view the ch√¢teau and its terraces offered of the valley of the Seine, a view like that of his birthplace, the Ch√¢teau de Pau. He ordered from Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau an expansion of the terraces by the Seine. Work began in 1594. Quickly finished by executive architect Jean de Fourcy, with Guillaume Marchant conducting the masonry work, the job involved the installation of grottoes, with automated fountains made by Italians, the Francini brothers, Thomas and Alexandre. The French garden, spread out by the Seine on five terraces, was designed by landscape designer √âtienne Dup√©rac and by gardener Claude Mollet. Riverside elevation and partial plan of the Ch√¢teau-Neuf, engraving by Androuet du Cerceau (1576) History At the outset, the ch√¢teau was the dwelling of those who had it built: Henry II, who died in 1559 (from a lance wound received in a tournament in Paris, three years after the ch√¢teau was begun); and, above all, his wife, Catherine de' Medici. Henry II would expand Ch√¢teau-Neuf considerably and sojourn there regularly, while his numerous children, legitimate and bastard, lived at Ch√¢teau-Vieux. Catherine stopped going to the ch√¢teau toward the end of her life in 1589, after her astrologer, C√¥me Ruggieri, predicted that she would meet her death in Saint-Germain. In 1562, two years after the death of King Francis II of France on December 5, 1560, the Queen of Navarre arrived in Saint-Germain escorted by a grand cort√®ge at the head of which rode her spirited second husband, the Duke of Vend√¥me. Several days of festivals ensued with diverse games and even a bullfight. Among the guests was their son, the 9-year-old Henri de B√©arn, the future Henry IV, and Henry II's third son, the 11-year-old Duke of Orl√©ans who would become the future Henry III. It was in this ch√¢teau that \\"Louis- Dieudonn√©\\" (Louis the God-given), the future King Louis XIV, was born on September 5, 1638. His father, Louis XIII, died there on May 14, 1643. Ch√¢teau-Neuf was the refuge of Charles II of England in 1650, after the execution of his father. During the Fronde, the French civil war in the mid-17th century, the \\"Grande Mademoiselle\\", Anne Marie Louise, Duchess of Montpensier, came to Saint-Germain seeking asylum and installed herself at Ch√¢teau-Neuf where \\"she lay in a wonderfully beautiful chamber in a ruined tower, well-gilded and large but with no glass in the windows and a meager fire.\\" In 1668, a grand ceremony was organized that set off from the Ch√¢teau- Neuf for the baptism of the Grand Dauphin at the Sainte Chapelle of the Old Ch√¢teau. In 1682, the French Court left Saint-Germain for the Palace of Versailles. Remains of Ch√¢teau-Neuf: the pavilion of Henri IV in red brick and part of a ramp On January 17, 1688, Louis XIV allowed the exiled James II of England to base himself at Saint-Germain. There he stayed with his court in Ch√¢teau-Neuf, and then in the two ch√¢teaux, until his death. In the 1770s, the dilapidated ch√¢teau was given by Louis XVI to his younger brother the Comte d'Artois with the sum of 600,000 livres for work to be done on it. Demolition and reconstruction projects were carried out by the architects Joseph B√©langer et Fran√ßois Chalgrin. When the Revolution came, the Ch√¢teau was declared bien nationaux and sold to its former manager, who demolished it, parceled out the land, and sold the materials. Nothing remains today but the Pavilion of Henry II, the Pavillon du jardiner, and a few vestiges of the cellars to be found in the neighborhood ‚Äì 3 rue des Arcades, for example.

Koerner Wilhelm Heinrich Detlev \\"Big Bill\\" K√∂rner (November 1878 ‚Äì August 11, 1938), also known as Wilhelm Heinrich Dethlef Koerner, William HD Koerner, WHDK, or W.H.D. Koerner,Horton, Scott. Harper's Magazine. The Illustrated President was a noted illustrator of the American West whose works became known to new audiences when his painting, nicknamed A Charge to Keep, was used as the cover image for the ghostwritten biography by the same name by George W. Bush. This painting, which hung in the Oval Office during the Bush presidency was of special interest to journalists due to the interpretation given by Bush of the painting's meaning in light of the meaning and title attached to the painting by the artist. Life and career Koerner was born in Lunden, Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia. His parents immigrated to Clinton, Iowa when he was three years old. Although he had little art training as a youth, his raw talent was always obvious to his parents and to everyone who viewed his sketches. At the age of twenty, Koerner was hired by the Chicago Tribune as a staff artist at $5 per day. Shortly thereafter, he married and accepted a job as art editor for a brand new newspaper, the United States Daily. When the paper folded, he and his wife moved to New York City, where he was hired by Pilgrim Magazine to cover the 1904 St. Louis Exposition. He enrolled at the Art Students League for a two- year program during 1905‚Äì07 under George Bridgman, Norman Rockwell's teacher. A student colleague later persuaded Koerner to apply to Howard Pyle's illustration school in Wilmington. Koerner's exposure to Howard Pyle was significant, but his student colleagues also had much to offer and he shared techniques and styles with the likes of N. C. Wyeth, Harvey Dunn, Frank Schoonover and Stanley Arthurs. While still a Pyle student, he rented a studio adjacent to Anton Otto Fischer and William Foster and the interaction between these talented students proved mutually invaluable. Howard Pyle died in 1911, and Koerner published a tribute in the New Amstel Magazine. A year later, the first exhibition by Pyle's students was presented to the public, and Koerner's works figured prominently. In 1919, the Saturday Evening Post art editor invited Koerner to illustrate two articles with Western themes, which proved to be a major turning point in his life. The articles \\"The Covered Wagon\\" and \\"Traveling the Old Trails\\" entailed many Western frontier scenes, which up to that point he had not experienced. Koerner began researching, and the West captured his imagination. Koerner soon became one of the best-known artists of the old West, travelling to the area for further research. From 1922 onwards, Koerner illustrated more than two hundred and fifty stories with Western themes and painted over six hundred pictures for periodicals. He illustrated a number of books that later were made into films based on his illustrations, including those by author Zane Grey (The Drift Fence [film: Drift Fence] and Sunset Pass [three films, all titled Sunset Pass]) and Eugene Manlove Rhodes' classic, Paso Por Aqui (film: Four Faces West). It is estimated he completed nearly two thousand illustrations of which about eighteen hundred were done for magazines, as well as advertisements for C. W. Post's Grape-Nuts and Postum cereals. Maxfield Parrish influenced Koerner's bold use of color. Parrish illustrated \\"The Great Southwest\\" articles by Raymond Stannard Baker which appeared in Century Magazine. A prolific and versatile artist- illustrator, \\"Big Bill\\" Koerner's work gained considerable visibility through his cover and story illustrations for the Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal, Harper's Magazine, McClure's Magazine, American Magazine, Cosmopolitan and Redbook. At the time of his death in 1938 at fifty-eight, the artist had received commissions for over 500 paintings and completed drawings for more than 200 western-themed stories. Each week he produced at least one full oil, a head, and a vignette. During the last three years of his life, Koerner was seriously ill and unable to paint. Koerner's illustrations are compared with those of Frederic Remington, Charles M. Russell, Philip R. Goodwin, and Harvey Dunn. They are known for his bold brushwork with a vibrant color palette which enabled his vigorous depictions of the \\"Great American West\\", emblematic images of those untamed territories.Hutchinson, William Henry.

Professional career O'Connor became the youngest ever Super Rugby debutant at the age of 17, and the second youngest Wallaby in Australian rugby history at the age of 18. He is a versatile 'utility back'. When asked about his preferred position in 2009, he said, \\"I feel more comfortable at 12 as a second ball player. I also like 15. You definitely get a lot of space. I just want to get on the field whether it is 10, 12 or 15.\\" Early years: 2008‚Äì2013 O'Connor with Australia in 2011. O'Connor joined the Force in 2008, and came off the bench for his first Super 14 cap in a match against the Reds in Week 10 of the 2008 season. He completed the season's final three matches running on at inside centre. Later that year he made his Australian debut, when he came off the bench as replacement fullback against Italy, scoring three tries to help Australia to a 31‚Äì8 win. In 2009, O'Connor was the Western Force 'Rookie of the Year' award and also won the Wallabies 'Rookie of the Year'. In 2012 O'Connor commenced a two-year contract with the Melbourne Rebels. His teammates included Nic Stirzaker, fullback Kurtley Beale, centre Mitch Inman, and English international Danny Cipriani. He played at fly-half for the Wallabies in three Tests against the Lions and was included in a five- man leadership group for the team. After continued ill-discipline off the field, the Rebels withdrew from contract extension negotiations at the end of the 2013 Super Rugby season and he was released by the franchise. Following a number of off-field indiscretions on O'Connor's part and a drunken incident at Perth Airport, O'Connor's ARU top-up contract was torn up and was suspended from the remainder of the test season. Following this low, O'Connor was in talks with the Western Force and the Queensland Reds however, nothing eventuated and O'Connor was forced to ply his trade offshore. European stint: 2013‚Äì14 O'Connor with London Irish in 2014. On 28 October 2013, O'Connor indicated that he was en route to London to play rugby for \\"a few months\\".https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/james-oconnor-london- irish-australia He was signed by London Irish in October 2013 until the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. He made his debut against Northampton Saints on 3 November and set up the only try that day. He claimed his first try for the club against Worcester Warriors on 4 January 2014, in a match ending 22‚Äì9 to the Exiles with O'Connor scoring all 22 points. 2015: Return to Australia In 2015, he returned to Super Rugby in a bid to make the Wallabies Rugby World Cup 2015 squad by playing for the Queensland Reds. O'Connor produced solid performances and was arguably one of the higher performers for a poor Queensland outfit, being shifted between fullback, flyhalf and wing in his first appearances before locking down the Red 15 jersey in the last rounds of the season. Although a part of Wallabies coach Michael Cheika's squads for Wallabies logistics camps throughout the course of the year, O'Connor was not included in the first extended 40-man and subsequently did not feature in any of the squads to follow, including the 2015 Rugby World Cup squad. O'Connor was announced to be part of Brisbane City's squad for their NRC title- defending campaign. On 13 October, the QRU and Queensland Reds announced that O'Connor would be released from his contract effective immediately, meaning he would not play the 2016 Super Rugby season for the Reds and finish his 2-year contract. It is widely expected that he will return to RC Toulon and be joined by former Super Rugby and Wallabies teammates Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell and Quade Cooper. O'Connor's release also meant the end of a potential appearance for Brisbane City in the domestic NRC had he sufficiently recovered to play. 2015 and beyond: Return to Europe O'Connor preparing a kick for Toulon In 2015 O'Connor signed with Toulon after failing to make the Australian 2015 Rugby World Cup squad with the . After allegations of cocaine use and Toulon decided not to renew his contract and thus he left the club at the ending of the season. In 2017 O'Connor signed with English Premiership club Sale Sharks shortly before the 2017‚Äì18 season. This comes amid rumours he had been declined a contract renewal from Toulon. Off-field Controversies O'Connor has been involved in a number of off-field controversies, attracting criticism from senior members of the Wallabies. Most recently, in September 2013, he was stood down from the Wallabies following an incident in which he was removed from Perth airport by Australian Federal Police. As a result, O'Connor missed the final two matches of the 2013 Rugby Championship and was released from his Wallabies contract by the Australian Rugby Union. In February 2017 O'Connor was arrested together with former All Blacks player, Ali Williams, in Paris on suspicion of attempting to buy cocaine. Media O'Connor was a participant in the second season of reality competition series Australia's Greatest Athlete.

The neighborhood is located west of Paulus Hook and Marin Boulevard, north of Grand Street, east of the Turnpike Extension, and south of The Village and Christopher Columbus Drive. Much of it is included in the Van Vorst Park Historical District.*Van Vorst Park Historical District The park was a centerpiece of Van Vorst Township, a township that existed in Hudson County from 1841 to 1851. Van Vorst was incorporated as a township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 12, 1841, from portions of Bergen Township. On March 18, 1851, Van Vorst Township was annexed by Jersey City.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 148. Accessed June 26, 2013. The name Van Vorst comes from a prominent family in the area, the first of which arrived in the 1630s as superindentent of the patroonship Pavonia, the earliest European settlement on the west bank of the Hudson River in the province of New Netherland. His homestead at Harsimus, plus others at Communipaw, Paulus Hook, Minakwa, Pamrapo were later incorporated into Bergen. His namesake and eighth generation descendant, Cornelius Van Vorst, was the twelfth Mayor of Jersey City serving from 1860 to 1862. Like Harsimus Cove and Hamilton Park to the north and Bergen-Lafayette to the southwest, the neighborhood contains nineteenth century rowhouses and brownstones.Hamilton Park Neighborhood and Historic District It is home to the Jersey City Medical Center, James J.

Park  Gazebo in Van Vorst Park Van Vorst Park is a two-acre city park bounded by Barrow Street on the east, Montgomery Street on the north, Jersey Avenue on the west and York Street on the south. The park was renovated in 1999 at a cost of two million dollars with money raised by the Friends of Van Vorst Park. The park is bordered by 19th century brownstones and townhouses including the Heppenheimer Mansion. It contains a large gazebo at the center, two playgrounds, a splash park and a dog park. An iconic cast iron water fountain sits in the western quadrant of the park. The surface of the park primarily consists of grass and a paved walkway. Competitive sports, such as football and soccer are prohibited in the park area. Vegetation in the park is diverse and is maintained by the community.

Biography Born to a family of petty nobles, Staneviƒçius studied at the Jesuit gymnasium in Kra≈æiai from 1817 to 1821. For a year he worked in Kra≈æiai as a private teacher, before enrolling into the Art and Literature Department of Vilnius University. There he was influenced by democratic ideas of professors such as Joachim Lelewel and Ignacy Onacewicz. Staneviƒçius joined a cultural movement to promote the Lithuanian language. After graduation in 1826, he stayed in Vilnius, working as a private tutor and preparing his works for publication. In 1829, he published three of his works (a grammar book, collection of folk songs, and his fables). Staneviƒçius then moved to Raseiniai and lived in the Plater estate, managing their private library. During the Uprising of 1830, Staneviƒçius traveled to K√∂nigsberg where he met with Ludwig Rhesa and collected materials for future publications. After the death of his patron Jerzy Plater in 1836, Staneviƒçius moved to the estate of Jerzy's brother Kazimierz Plater in Stemplƒós. There Staneviƒçius continued to care for the 3,000-piece library until his death from tuberculosis in 1848. Works In 1829, inspired by Johann Gottfried Herder, Staneviƒçius published Dainos ≈æemaiƒçi≈≥ (Songs of the Samogitians), a sample of 30 of the most artistic and valuable Samogitian folk songs from his 150-song collection. Four years later he published an addendum (Pa≈æymƒós ≈æemaiti≈°kos gaidos) with melodies for these songs. He is best remembered for the publication of ≈†e≈°ios pasakos (Six Fables), a book of six fables and odes ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ≈°lovƒó (The Samogitians' Glory) written by Staneviƒçius himself. Two fables borrowed plots from Aesop and the other four mixed the author's own ideas with Samogitian folklore. The most important fables are Aitvarai (a type of household spirit in Lithuanian mythology) and Arklys ir me≈°ka (The Horse and the Bear ‚Äì symbols of the Auk≈°taitians and Samogitians respectively) as they depict the worldview, values, and culture of everyday Samogitian peasants. Staneviƒçius lived in an era of rising Romanticism, but his works are more Realistic due to his close contacts with the peasantry. The ode, the first example of this genre in the Lithuanian language, celebrated growing interest in the Lithuanian language and history at Vilnius University. Towards the end of his life, Staneviƒçius took an academic interest in the Lithuanian language, history, and mythology. His unfinished manuscript on Lithuanian history was partially published only in 1893 and fully in 1967, but is significant as the first critical history of Lithuania and first scholarly analysis of the Lithuanian mythology. In contrast to Dionizas Po≈°ka or Simonas Daukantas, who searched for glorious and idealized history, Staneviƒçius carefully studied, validated, and cited his sources, remaining truthful to the facts, and was not afraid to reject romantic legends. He heavily criticized Teodor Narbutt and Maciej Stryjkowski as inaccurate. Staneviƒçius debunked many of the romantic legends, especially in the area of Lithuanian mythology, including the romantic notion of the ancient Romuva temple and connections drawn between Roman gods and Lithuanian gods.

Situated on the shores of Lake Erie in North Madison, Ohio, this home is constructed with stone, in an I-plan form. The home originally had two bedrooms (a master bedroom, and a guest bedroom), as well as a separate workspace and study. In addition, there was a shop accessible on the other side of the carport (the shop was turned into a guest bedroom when restoration of the space was done in 1980). The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The Karl A. Staley House is considered significant under Criterion C according to the National Register of Historic Places. The Staley House is one of only a handful of \\"user-built\\" Wright buildings in Ohio. An example of one of Wright's Usonian designs, the house was planned in 1950‚Äì51, with construction taking place between 1951 and 1954. Noted for its strict adherence to Wright's original design, it is unique among Ohio Wright structures in that it utilizes natural, local river stone collected at Mill Creek in Madison (unlike other Ohio Wright homes in Ohio that use brick). The view of the home from the street is actually the rear facade. The front window-wall faces Lake Erie and offers panoramic views of the water and shoreline.http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/14000042.htm References * Storrer, William Allin.

LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437 (6th Cir. 2003), was a lawsuit filed by attorney Gregory J Reed in March 1999 on Rosa Parks' behalf against American hip-hop duo Outkast and LaFace Records, claiming that the group had illegally used Rosa Parks' name without her permission for the song \\"Rosa Parks\\", the most successful radio single of Outkast's 1998 album Aquemini. The song's chorus, which Parks' legal defense felt was disrespectful to her, is as follows: \\"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus / Do you want to bump and slump with us / We the type of people make the club get crunk.\\" The case was dismissed in November 1999 by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Kloka Hackett. In August 2000, Parks' attorney Reed hired attorney Johnnie Cochran to help her appeal the district court's decision. Cochran argued that the song did not have First Amendment protection because, although its title carried Parks' name, its lyrics were not about her. However, Judge Hackett upheld Outkast's right to use Parks' name in November 1999, and Parks took the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where some charges were remanded for further trial. Parks' attorneys Reed, refiled in August 2004, and named BMG, Arista Records and LaFace Records as the defendants, asking for $5 million in damages. (Also named as defendants were several parties not directly connected to the songs, including Barnes & Noble and Borders Group for selling the songs, and Gregory Dark and Braddon Mendelson, the director and producer, respectively, of the 1998 music video. The judge dismissed the music video producers from the case by the reason of \\"fraudulent joinder\\", as these defendants had no connection to the case and there was no justifiable reason for the plaintiff's attorneys to add them to the lawsuit.) In October 2004, U.S. District Judge George Caram Steeh appointed Dennis Archer, a former mayor of Detroit and Michigan Supreme Court justice, as guardian of legal matters for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyer were pursuing the case based on their own financial interests.\\"'I understand I am a symbol, but I have never gotten used to being a public person'\\", Associated Press State & Local Wire, December 4, 2004 \\"My auntie would never, ever go to this length to hurt some young artists trying to make it in the world,\\" Parks' niece Rhea McCauley said in an Associated Press interview. \\"As a family, our fear is that during her last days Auntie Rosa will be surrounded by strangers trying to make money off of her name.\\"\\"Medical records show Rosa Parks had dementia as early as 2002\\", Associated Press State & Local Wire, January 13, 2005 The lawsuit was settled April 15, 2005. In the settlement agreement, Outkast and their producer and recorded labels paid Parks an undisclosed cash settlement and agreed to work with the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development in creating educational programs about the life of Rosa Parks. The record labels and Outkast admitted to no wrongdoing.

It was compiled in 1835 by his student Heinrich Gustav Hotho, using Hegel's own hand-written notes and notes his students took during the lectures, but Hotho's work may render some of Hegel's thought more systematic than Hegel's initial presentation.G. W. F. Hegel, Aesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art, trans. T. M. Knox, 2 vols. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975. Hegel's Aesthetics is regarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been produced since Aristotle.Houlgate, 2009 Hegel's thesis about the historical dissolution of art has been the subject of much scholarly debate and influenced such thinkers like Theodor W. Adorno, Martin Heidegger, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Jacques Derrida and Arthur Danto. Hegel was himself influenced by Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. Heidegger calls Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics \\"the most comprehensive reflection on the essence of art that the West possesses\\".Martin Heidegger, Gesamtausgabe, vol. 5, Frankfurt, 1977, p. 68. Content Hegel develops his account of art as a mode of absolute spirit that he calls \\"the beautiful ideal,\\" which he defines most generally as > Now when truth in this its external existence [Dasein] is present to > consciousness immediately, and with the concept remains immediately in unity > with its external appearance, the Idea is not only true but beautiful. > Beauty is determined as the sensible shining of the Idea.(LA 111/V√Ñ I.151) This ideal is developed throughout the Lectures accordance Hegel's Logic: #The first universal part is devoted to the concept of the artistic ideal. #The second particular part examines this ideal as it actualizes itself in three stages: ##Symbolic art, understood to encompass everything before Classical Greek art ##Classical art ##Romantic art, understood to emerge with the advent of Christianity on the world stage #The third singular part concerns itself with an examination of each of the five major arts in ascending order of \\"inwardness\\": ##architecture ##sculpture ##painting ##music ##poetry In these second two parts of the Lectures, Hegel documents the development of art from the paradigmatically symbolic architecture to the paradigmatically classical sculpture to the romantic arts of painting, music, and poetry. At the time it was noted for the wealth of pictures included with it. Contrary to once-common belief, Hegel nowhere declares art to be \\"dead.\\" What he says, in a representative statement is, \\"For us art counts no longer as the highest mode in which truth procures existence for itself.\\"LA 103/V√Ñ I.141 He speaks frequently of its \\"dissolution\\" [Aufl√∂sung], not its end [Ende], despite Hotho's use of the latter for the heading of the final moment of the Romantic art form.

He was born in Ferri√®res in what is today the d√©partement of Eure. A total of eleven chansons courtoises have been attributed to him. In 1209, Raoul was mentioned in a donation to the Abbey of No√©. The most famous of Raoul's songs is unquestionably Quant li rossignols jolis (\\"When the pretty nightingales\\"), which is probably the song Johannes de Grocheo (c.1300) describes as a cantus coronatus (crowned, meaning probably that it had received a prize in a competition). Unfortunately, this song is ascribed to the Chastelain de Couci in another manuscript. It was used as a model for the anonymous L'autrier m'iere rendormis. Musically, it starts at the upper octave, flows downwards, and establishes a centre on d. All of Raoul's melodies, including Quant li rossignols, were recorded in bar form, save two readings Si sui du tout a fine Amour (possibly later revisions). None are recorded in mensural notation. Most of the melodies are in the D modes (authentic and plagal), but three are in the authentic G mode. Poetically, all but one of Raoul's compositions use the ABABBAAB rhyme scheme and all of his works are also octosyllabic, with the heptasyllabic exceptions of Quant ivers a tel poissance and Quant li rossignols and the mixed octo- and heptasyllabic verses of the disputed Quant il ne pert fueille ne flours.

They represent the final and in some ways the decisive element of his philosophical system. In light of his distinctive philosophical approach, using a method that is dialectical and historical, Hegel offers a radical reinterpretation of the meaning of Christianity and its characteristic doctrines. The approach taken in these lectures is to some extent prefigured in Hegel's first published book, The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807). Publication history Hegel's conception and execution of the lectures differed significantly on each of the occasions he delivered them, in 1821, 1824, 1827, and 1831. The first German edition was published at Berlin in 1832, the year after Hegel's death, as part of the posthumous Werke series. The book was rather hastily put together by Philip Marheineke, mainly from students' copies of the lectures delivered during different sessions, though it also contained matter taken from notes and outlines in Hegel's own handwriting. In 1840, two of the Young Hegelians, Bruno Bauer and Karl Marx, began work on a second edition,McLellan 2006. pp. 32-33. which appeared under Marheineke's name. In the preparation of this second edition, the editors drew largely on several important papers found amongst Hegel's manuscripts, in which his ideas were developed in much greater detail than in any of the sketches previously used, including the \\"Lectures on the Proofs of the Existence of God,\\" which Hegel was revising for the press when he died. Marheineke had also fresh and very complete copies of the lectures made by some of Hegel's most distinguished pupils. Yet, the book in the form in which we have it, remains an editorial compilation. No part of it, not even the part which is Hegel's actual composition, was intended for publication, and the informal and discursive character of the Lectures is apparent. In 1895, Ms. J. Burdon Sanderson and Rev. Ebenezer Brown Speirs published the first English translation in three volumes including the work on the proofs of the existence of God. This edition used 1840's copy to produce the translation. In the 1920s, Georg Lasson published a new edition within the S√§mtliche Werke series. It used special types to differentiate the text of Hegel's manuscripts, from his students' notes, but stitched lectures from different session together, and cut out what Lasson viewed as repetitions. Although the result is not always praised today, his edition is useful to researches as he had access to manuscripts that have since been lost.Hegel 1988. pp. 8-9. In 1990, Oxford University Press published a critical edition, separating the series of lectures and presenting them as independent units on the basis of a complete re-editing of the sources by Walter Jaeschke. This English translation was prepared by a team consisting of Robert F. Brown, Peter C. Hodgson, and J. Michael Stewart, with the assistance of H. S. Harris. The three volumes include editorial introductions, critical annotations on the text, textual variants, tables, bibliography, and glossary.Hegel 1990. In 2001-2004, Mugahid Abdulmonem Mugahid, a relatively unnotable Egyptian scholar, published for the first-time an Arabic translation of the lectures based on Sanderson's translation. This edition was divided into a series of 9 volumes. In 2014-2015, Abu Yaareb al-Marzouki published a critical Arabic translation of the lectures in two volumes. These were re-titled Dialectic of Religion and Enlightenment and Genesis of Human and Religious Perception. Abu Yaareb relied on Lasson's edition for the editorial process and on Suhrkamp Verlag's copy for the general layout. He gave extensive criticism in his preliminary remarks and highlighted the importance of this work. Content \\"The Consummate [or Absolute] Religion\\" is Hegel's name for Christianity, which he also designates \\"the Revelatory [or Revealed] Religion.\\"Hodgson 2005. p. 85. In these lectures, he offers a speculative reinterpretation of major Christian doctrines: the Trinity, the Creation, humanity, estrangement and evil, Christ, the Spirit, the spiritual community, church and world. These interpretations have had a powerful and controversial impact on modern theology. Hegel expanded on Luther's idea of Christian liberty. He touches on pantheism, and discusses religions of India, China, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome. It is the only work where he examines Islam. In the last of three volumes based on these lectures, Hegel discusses at length many different philosophical arguments for the existence of God. Reception The social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer wrote in a 1910 preface to The Golden Bough, originally published in 1890, that while he had never studied Hegel, his friend James Ward, and the philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart, had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of \\"the nature and historical relations of magic and religion\\". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that \\"we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection.\\"Frazer 1976. pp. ix, 423. In his introduction to the translation, al-Marzouki emphasized the importance of reading the lectures by Muslim readers \\"to realize the significance of why Hegel overlooked Islam even though he discussed almost every other religion in his time\\". Also, he states that reading the lectures is crucial to critically overcome the Kantian transcendentalism and truly understand the relationship between Marx and Hegel.

Originally Capilano Drive/Capilano Freeway, it was officially renamed October 1, 1999 after NHL hockey player Wayne Gretzky, as a tribute to his years with the Edmonton Oilers. The same day, Wayne Gretzky's number 99 jersey was retired at the Skyreach Centre, which lies just west of Wayne Gretzky Drive, at 118 Avenue. 66/75 Street is a major arterial road in east Edmonton which serves residential and industrial areas. Wayne Gretzky Drive and 75 Street, both located between Whitemud Drive and Yellowhead Trail, is part of the eastern leg of what was planned to be Edmonton's Inner Ring Road. Wayne Gretzky Drive and 75 Street are part of a continuous roadway that runs from 41 Avenue SW to 33 Street NE (Edmonton's northeastern city limit) and includes portions of 66 Street and Fort Road, as well as all of Manning Drive. Overview 106 Avenue. Wayne Gretzky Drive Preceded by 75 Street, Wayne Gretzky Drive starts at 101 Avenue to become a freeway. It crosses the North Saskatchewan River valley, by passing under 106 Avenue and Ada Boulevard. As it approaches Northlands and the Alberta Avenue area, it again returns into an arterial, with traffic lights. The exits to Northlands at 112 Avenue and 116 Avenue are clearly marked with overhead street signs in blue, and with the Northlands logo. Because of property constraints, to maintain the number of lanes, the freeway is divided into Wayne Gretzky Drive Northbound and Southbound, formally 72 Street and 73 Street, at 118 Avenue. 119 Avenue services the north Northlands Coliseum parking lot to the west, and is a dead end to the east, because it was blocked off from being used as a shortcut, disrupting traffic flow during major Northlands events. The northbound and southbound then converge again before crossing the LRT lines. Fort Road, which runs to the southwest, meets up with Wayne Gretzky Drive at an at-grade intersection, then runs concurrently along with it for approximately to Yellowhead Trail. The single-point urban interchange at Yellowhead Trail, allows Yellowhead Trail to run as a freeway, and has the benefit of only one traffic light, and U-turns for westbound and eastbound traffic. At this interchange, Wayne Gretzky Drive changes its name to Fort Road. Because of their short lengths, Wayne Gretzky Drive and Groat Road will be the only freeways in Edmonton not to have a highway designation, until the completion of Terwillegar Drive. 66/75 Street 66 Street and 75 Street functions as the southern extension of Wayne Gretzky Drive. It begins as 66 Street at 41 Avenue SW and passes north through Mill Woods, passing by Mill Woods Town Centre, Grey Nuns Community Hospital and Mill Woods Golf Course. At Whitemud Drive the roadway becomes 75 Street and passes through the Southeast Industrial area. North of Argyll Road, 75 Street transitions to passing through mature residential communities. Despite being designated as part of the inner ring road, heavy trucks are prohibited on 75 Street between 90 Avenue and 98 Avenue. At 101 Avenue, 75 Street becomes Wayne Gretzky Drive. 66 Street and 75 Street is part of the southeast alignment of the Valley Line of the Edmonton LRT which Mill Woods with downtown. The LRT will run at-grade, parallel (on the east side) to the roadway between 28 Avenue and Wagner Road, with the exception of an elevated section near Wagner Road as the line will pass over 75 Street and transition to follow 83 Street towards downtown. Stations and stops will be constructed along 66 Street and 75 Street with Grey Nuns stop near 31 Avenue, Millbourne/Woodvale stop near 38 Avenue, and Davies station near Wagner Road; Mill Woods station will east 66 Street along 28 Avenue. Completion is expected for 2020. Bridge structures Capilano Bridge takes Wayne Gretzky Drive over the North Saskatchewan River, spanning . Grant Moellmann Bridge, takes Wayne Gretzky Drive over the LRT tracks and a CN spur that used to service the surrounding industrial area. It was opened in 1995 bridging the gap between 120 Avenue and Fort Road. It is named after Edmontonian ironworker Grant Moellmann (1935‚Äì1994) who fell to his death placing the bridge's last girder on November 24, 1994.City of Edmonton, Naming Edmonton : From Ada to Zoie, 2004. A plaque was placed on the bridge in September 1998 to mark the significance of this naming. History Capilano Freeway (Capilano Drive) originally opened in 1969 by widening and connecting the residential streets of 75 Street south of the river and 72 Street north of the river; it ended just north of 118 Avenue. In 1995, the northern extension of Capilano Drive was opened which completed the link to Fort Road and Yellowhead Trail. Proposals to honour Wayne Gretzky by renaming a city street date back to 1987, when it was originally proposed to rename 99 Street, coinciding with number 99; at the request of Gretzky, the plan was discontinued. In 1989 the City of Edmonton, in co-ordination with Northlands and Molson Brewery, commissioned the artwork of the bronze statue which was unveiled on August 27, 1989, one year after he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, and moved to Rogers Place in 2016. Following Gretzky's retirement in 1999, there a second proposal to rename 99 Street brought forward by a fan; however Capilano Drive was ultimately chosen to be renamed Wayne Gretzky Drive.

The seventeen chansons ascribed to him in the standard listing of Raynaud-Spanke are found in fifteen chansonniers, some without attribution or with conflicting attributions where they occur in multiple sources.See Elisabeth Nissen, ed., Les chansons attribu√©es √† Guiot de Dijon et Jocelin (Paris: Champion, 1929), pp.iii-iv. Of Guiot's life, little is known. His name suggests he was from Dijon. The mention of three names in two songs gives further indication of his milieu: an envoi naming 'Erard a Chassenay' has been assumed to refer to one of the three individuals called √ârart who were barons of Chassenay in Champagne.See Elisabeth Nissen, ed., Les chansons attribu√©es √† Guiot de Dijon et Jocelin (Paris: Champion, 1929), pp.ix Several Guiot's songs survive with more than one distinct melody. The version of Quant je plus voi felon rire in the Chansonnier du roi, the melody of which was added later, is unusual in being through-composed and in Franconian notation. Overall, Guiot's melodies are usually identified as those appearing in bar form, which all end on the same pitch class. Guiot probably modelled Chanter m'estuet, coment que me destraigne (RS117) after the Occitan song Si be¬∑m sui loing et entre gent estraigna by the troubadour Peirol, although this is based on assumptions from shared versification and cannot be confirmed, since no melody survives for RS117. The song Penser ne doit vilanie (RS1240), sometimes attributed to him, served as a model for the anonymous Marian song De penser a vilanie (RS1239), which survives uniquely in the Chansonnier Clairambault, i.e. TrouvX.The sigla used here are the standard trouv√®re sigla given in Edouard Schwan, Die altfranz√∂sische Liederhandschriften: ihr Verh√§ltnis, ihre Entstehung und ihre Bestimmung (Berlin: Weidmann, 1886).

Raynaud's Bibliographie des altfranz√∂sische Liedes, neu bearbeitet und erg√§nzt, (Leiden: Brill, 1955), p.25.

Confederate units in the vital Kanawha River valley of western Virginia were styled the \\"Army of the Kanawha\\" after they were put under the command of former Virginia governor Henry A. Wise on June 6, 1861. Kanawha valley native John B. Floyd, himself a former Virginia governor and former U.S. Secretary of War, assumed command on August 11 intending to improve recruitment, but personal animosity between the two politicians prevented Floyd from fully exercising control of the inexperienced force until early autumn. After the Confederate commanders' quarrel cost them victory at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry, Confederate States Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin sent an order relieving Wise and ordering him to Richmond, and Floyd commanded the brigade-sized force until he was sent to the Western Theater. The \\"Army\\" was incorporated into the 3rd division of the Army of Central Kentucky in late December and while the army ceased to exist as such, the brigade fought at Fort Donelson. What men remained after the Confederate surrender at Donelson eventually became members of the Army of Mississippi before the Battle of Shiloh. Units and strength By the end of May 1861 Cols. John McCausland and Christopher Q. Tompkins had enlisted nearly 1,000 men at Kanawha Court House, Kanawha County. From these men and subsequent recruits Tompkins organized the 1st Kanawha regiment, designated later as the 22nd Virginia Infantry and McCausland organized the 2nd Kanawha regiment, designated later as the 36th Virginia Infantry.

Philadelphia: Saunders. Following World War II, she returned to work at the New York Infirmary and also at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where she described the twelve cases of what was then known as juvenile melanoma and recognized that these lesions have benign behavior despite their microscopic resemblance to melanoma. This clinically important information came to be published in the American Journal of Pathology in 1948, and the lesion now bears her name.Spitz S. Melanomas of Childhood. Am. J.

The simplicity of line and detail, the hard-edged arches of radiating bricks, and the row of oriels on the south wall are all typical of the Chicago style. The facade and some of the interior was designed by local architect Kenneth McDonald. The interior of the building was altered over the years and very few original details remained by the 1970s. The lobby's original marble floor did survive. The original apartments each had a private hallway with the rooms opening into it. The private halls, then opened onto a long public hallway. Some elements of this design remained after the conversion to hotel. Apartments consisted of four rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, plus a linen closet and a pantry. Each floor had private rooms at the rear for servants and the fifth floor contained storage rooms, one for each apartment. History The building was completed in 1894 when the block of Fourth Street it is located on was still residential, but the business district was spreading south towards Broadway. Within a few decades, Fourth Street north of Broadway would become Louisville, and Kentucky's, dominant commercial district. Recognizing a trend, Alonzo J. Ross, a local grocer and entrepreneur, purchased the lot in 1893 and commissioned the building. When it first opened it was billed as \\"first metropolitan apartment house\\". At the time, local papers praised the building for importing the style and elegance of apartment buildings in cities like Chicago. Ross sold the building in 1901 to Theophilus Conrad, but continued to operate a grocery on the first floor until 1904. Conrad owned several local apartment buildings, including St. James Apartments in Old Louisville. The Rossmore was renamed the Raleigh Apartments for a brief time in the 1920s, but by 1923 it was listed as the Berkeley Hotel. It was deemed historically significant in 1978 as an example of the Chicago school of architecture, as well as being one of the oldest buildings at the time in the Fourth Street commercial district.

Don O'Neill Don O'Neill was born outside Chicago and raised in New Mexico where he attended high school with Ron Upshaw. He lives in Seattle. Program History The show began as a weekend sports radio program on KJR-AM in 1995 before moving to San Francisco in 1997 where Upshaw and O'Neill hosted morning drive on KCTC.Susan Slusser, \\"On the Air:\`Ticket' Targets Gen X Market,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, July 4, 1997. While on the Flagship Station for the Oakland Raiders, Ron & Don hosted the Joe Bugel Show, The Tim Brown Show, and The Jon Gruden Show. The show subsequently moved to Phoenix station KZZP-FM and then Dallas' KYNG-FM\\"KYNG Dallas Midday Team Fired During Charity Event,\\" Radio Ink, October 8, 2001. In Dallas, Don O'Neill hosted the CBS Network shows on the Dallas Cowboy Radio Network with Drew Person and Charlie Waters for the 2001-2002 NFL season. Ron Upshaw hosted the Pre and Post game shows at the first Dallas Cowboy home game after the 9/11 Terrorist Attack. The Ron & Don Show returned to Seattle in 2002 where they broadcast the morning show on former Hot Talk station KQBZ-FM. After a stop at WKLQ in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Ron & Don Show settled briefly at KKND-FM in New Orleans until Hurricane Katrina destroyed the KKND transmitter, leaving the show without a broadcast home. An opportunity to fill-in for KIRO-AM host Dave Ross led to a permanent assignment from 9:00pm to 1:00am in Seattle. In May 2006 their time slot was changed to afternoon drive from 3:00pm to 6:00pm. The program was live on-air at the time of the Seattle Jewish Federation shooting in 2006; KIRO-AM won a 2007 Edward R. Murrow Award for Spot News for its coverage of this incident. The show also received attention for fundraising efforts in response to Hurricane Katrina, in conjunction with the Seattle Seahawks and the Preservation Resource Center, including a live show from the front porch of a rebuilt New Orleans home. In 2008, following the cancellation of KIRO's short-lived long-form newscast - \\"The Big Story with Tony Miner\\" - the Ron & Don Show was extended by an hour to its current time slot of 3:00pm to 7:00pm. As of winter 2008 the program was designated as the top rated radio show in its time slot in the Seattle-Tacoma market but in summer of 2009 Arbitron's introduction of PPM's (Personal People Meters) dropped the now FM-only KIRO along with \\"Ron and Don\\" to approximately 15th in the market. The show was cancelled abruptly by KIRO and Bonneville on January 10, 2019, which came as a surprise to listeners and KIRO employees. On May 17, 2019, the return of Ron and Don was announced on various Social media platforms. \\"As the radio tower dies‚Ä¶ we now rise.\\" Ron & Don Radio returned on Radio.com on May 27, 2019.

It was described and named in 1881 by the Russian botanist Carl Maximowicz after the Russian explorer and botanist Nikolai Przhevalsky, who made several collecting trips to China in the 19th century. The plant is widely known throughout its native habitat for its medicinal properties. Salvia przewalskii forms a basal clump of yellow-green leaves 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 cm) high and wide, with flowering stalks rising 3 feet (91.4 cm) above the plant. The 6-12 inch (15 to 30 cm) leaves, with long petioles, have distinct veins on the underside. The inflorescence is branched, with widely spaced whorls of flowers opening a few at once. The 1 inch (2.54 cm) flowers are fat, with an unusual purple-red or red-brown color. The calyx is hairy and glandular, red-brown and two-lipped. It is usually seen only in botanical gardens, though seeds have become available for gardeners since the 1980s. Botanists have segregated the species into four varieties, distinguished by leaf shape and differences in the hairs covering the foliage.

He wrote fiction and nonfiction, publishing hundreds of short stories, articles, more than a dozen novels, and at least one play, \\"The Re-Enactment,\\" (under the name of Fred Vassi) at the Caffe Cino in January 1966. Many of his works appeared as \\"Anonymous\\" in their first printings. He is most often compared to Henry Miller, has been called the greatest erotic writer of his time and \\"foremost of his generation,\\" and praised by the likes of Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal, Saul Bellow, and Kate Millett. Biography Vassi was born and lived most of his life in New York City. He was married three times, but was well known for sexual, drug, and alternative-lifestyle experimentation. He viewed life as the theory and practice of liberation, an exploration of being sexual, that is an all-sexual being, bisexual, and homosexual. Vassi coined the term metasex, which meant any sex outside the bounds of heterosexual marriage. He once wrote in Beyond Bisexuality: > When one transcends male-female dualism, eroticism becomes susceptible of a > more subtle mathematical understanding. For each number, there is a > different and unique quality of consciousness, and no one is intrinsically > superior to any of the others. ... It is also fascinating to wonder whether > *zero,* or metacelibacy, may be seen not as a renunciation but as an embrace > of all metasex ... > The introduction of the metasexual paradigm is no less a shift in the > history of our evolving understanding. The vast majority of the species has > not seen past the conditioned strictures of the number *two.* And even those > in the vanguard, having their orgies, still operate from the standpoint of a > male-female dualism. The most sophisticated among them proclaim themselves > bisexuals, not aware that this is the dead-end of that particular tunnel > vision. The only way out is to go within to heal the internal split. A monad > has no gender. His biography in the book PoMoSexuals: challenging assumptions about gender and sexualityEdited by Carol Queen and Lawrence Schimmel; San Francisco: Cleis Press states, in part: \\"Marco Vassi was a literary avatar of the sexual revolution. He was deeply attuned to the politics of sex and sexual orientation, as well as the intersection of sex and spirituality. In his writing, as in his life (until his AIDS diagnosis), he explored fearlessly, bringing back dispatches from sexual frontiers most people never visited.\\" Vassi helped found the alternative media thinktank RainDance in 1969. He died January 14, 1989 from pneumonia due to AIDS. According to Heidenry, despite his erotic explorations and adventuring, Vassi was tragically unable to sustain a love relationship, and died alone, with only the care of his former girlfriend Annie Sprinkle. Marco is survived by his son Eric Van Johnson. Publishing history His works have been reissued by numerous publishers over the years, but in 1992, The Vassi Collection, a definitive ten-volume set of his works from Permanent Press, was published.

Ames, 171 U.S. 361 (1898), also called The Maximum Freight Case, was an 1898 United States Supreme Court case.. The Supreme Court voided a Nebraska railroad tariff law, declaring that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it takes property without the due process of law. The Court defined the constitutional limits of governmental power to set railroad and utility rates by stating that regulated industries have the right to a \\"fair return\\". The ruling was later overturned in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co..Siegel, Stephen A. Smyth v. Ames. Answers.com. Accessed 18 February 2009 The decision was unanimous and the majority opinion was written by Justice John M. Harlan. Prior history On April 12, 1893, Nebraska passed a law, a so-called \\"maximum rate bill\\", establishing maximum rates for the transportation of freights within the state. The Railroad Commissioners of Nebraska were empowered to reduce any freight rate. Several precedents had been set by the Supreme Court regarding state control over railways. Until Munn v. Illinois when the Granger Laws were declared constitutional, it had been held that railway property was protected from state authority by the Contract Clause of the Constitution, which states that no state shall pass any \\"Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts\\". However, in the Munn case, the Court ruled that all property was held subject to legislative regulation if it was \\"affected with a public interest\\". Further decisions built off the Munn decision, specifying that while the legislature may regulate property \\"affected by the public interest\\", they must exercise it reasonably by applying the used and useful principle, so as to not deprive citizens of their property without due process of law. Case The maximum rate law was contested by the Union Pacific, St. Joseph and Grand Island Railway, Omaha and Republican Valley Railway, and the Kansas City and Omaha Railway. They claimed the law was confiscation, and therefore unconstitutional. They said the law would make a difference of $2,250,00 annually. The Supreme Court unanimously found the law unconstitutional. The court found that it is not enough to show a tariff ‚Äì even if the tax is in the public interest ‚Äì still leaves a company enough money to pay operating expenses and stock dividends. Effects of the decision Businessmen were pleased by the decision, and believed it would give stability to railroad investments. Others were unhappy. The Interstate Commerce Commission was weakened by the Court's decision. Subsequent history The ruling was overturned in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co.

As the Holy Julian didst confess his faith with courage even unto death and victory and didst heal the poor and sick with generous charity, grant that this blessed oil may be an unction of strengthening both to souls and bodies, cooling fever, banishing pain, repairing what has been afflicted, granting soothing and refreshing sleep and restoring to peace and serenity and health and soundness the minds and bodies of those who are anointed therewith. O merciful Master protect and defend Thy servants (N.) from all evil, from all envy and from every illness of spirit or body, banish every inimical power, bless and cure them (N.) through Thy power, and the intercessions of Holy Julian, for all the powers of heaven praise Thee, and Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, together with Thine all-holy and life-creating Spirit, and Thine only-begotten son, both now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.\\" History The church is named after Saint Elian, a native of Emesa (now Homs), who was martyred for his refusal to renounce Christianity in 284 AD at the hands of his father, a Roman officer. St. Elian was a physician by trade and various miracles of healing are attributed to him. The church itself was founded in 432 on the claimed spot of St. Elian's death, with his remains placed in a sarcophagus in a small chapel to the right of the church's main crypt.Beattie and Pepper, 2001, p.55. In 1969‚Äì70, the church was renovated. During the renovation, the plaster which covered the inner walls of the crypt was removed, revealing ancient frescoes depicting murals of Jesus, Mary, the Apostles, and various Biblical prophets. The frescoes date to at least the 12th century, but it is widely believed to date to the 6th century, making them the oldest surviving church paintings in Syria. Today, they are complemented by new frescoes in the main nave and side- aisles of the church painted by two Romanian iconographers, showing various scenes of St. Elian's lifetime.Mannheim, 2001, p.209.

Part of Catholic Health, it is also a teaching hospital. The hospital has 467 beds and specializes in women's health services.  History  Sister Ursula Mattingly, DC, first administrator of the hospital.  Founding  The Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo was created in 1847, and Bishop John Timon, CM, its first prelate, immediately saw the lack of an organized healthcare system in the City of Buffalo. There were some private clinics, but no large central hospital, public or private. The city's mainly Protestant and nativist leadership did not adequately address the healthcare needs of the rapidly growing and mostly Catholic working class, partly due to prejudice. Some did try to establish a Protestant hospital, but efforts faded away for lack of popular interest. Bishop Timon took efforts into his own hands as he saw the pressing need of Buffalo's Catholics for proper healthcare. He traveled to Baltimore in March 1848, seeking a religious order to administer the new hospital. He especially wanted the Sisters of Charity (now known as the Daughters of Charity), who were based in Emmitsburg, Maryland, because they were founded by St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American saint, and because they had much prior experience working with Protestants. He believed these qualifications made them the ideal religious congregation to work in such a hostile anti-Catholic atmosphere as Buffalo was at the time. On 3 June 1848, eight Sisters of Charity, Sisters Ursula Mattingly, Ann de Sales Farren, Hieronimo O'Brien, Anacaria Hoey, Clare McDurby, Mary Aloysia Lilly, Mary Eliza Dougherty, and Agatha O'Keefe, arrived in Buffalo. Bishop Timon had purchased an unused brick schoolhouse and adjoining cottage at Pearl Place, which he gave to the Sisters to use. They outfitted it with 100 beds and living quarters for themselves. On 1 October 1848, Sisters of Charity Hospital officially opened as Buffalo's first large healthcare facility, under the leadership of Sister Ursula Mattingly, DC. The first patients were a group of six sailors.  Protestant dissent  Very little attention at first was given to the hospital originally, with The Buffalo Morning Express reporting the news simply by writing: \\"The city is well received in having a hospital for its own.\\" The New York State Legislature provided funding for sectarian hospitals in locations where there were no nonsectarian hospitals. Sisters of Charity Hospital was eligible and received $9,000 (equivalent to $266,667 in 2015 dollars). The state funding was done rather inconspicuously, and the news only gained attention a few months later, when some of Buffalo's Protestant doctors protested the state funding of a Catholic institution as the city's first hospital. Especially inflammatory was the presence of Catholic nuns. In a 2009 New York History Review article titled, \\"John Timon ‚Äî Buffalo‚Äôs First Bishop: His Forgotten Struggle to Assimilate Catholics in Western New York,\\" Paul E. Lubienecki wrote:An inpatient room at the Hospital in 1848. > \\"In antebellum America religious communities of women often absorbed the > brunt of anti-Catholic prejudice. Religious orders of women, who lived and > worked in a peculiar all female community, created and maintained schools, > orphanages and hospitals.

As Catholic women‚Äôs religious orders > began healthcare work in antebellum America, the role of women in nursing > and hospital administration was gaining recognition as a profession and > women were becoming empowered to take on non-traditional roles.\\" Tensions were high in New York at this time due to the recent Seneca Falls Convention, at which 68 women and 32 men out of 300 attendees signed the now- famous Declaration of Sentiments, which listed men's abuses of women's freedom and rights. Lubienecki wrote that the event was still fresh in the minds of the people of New York, and that the Protestant men of Buffalo felt threatened, increasing their strong objection to the educated, Catholic females who were running a now-state funded hospital. Buffalo's elite began speaking out against the Sisters Hospital and its state funding, criticizing its all-female leadership, lack of physicians' influence in decision making, and small staff. In early February 1850, Protestant doctors Josiah Trowbridge, Austin Flint, and James White privately complained to influential local Presbyterian minister, Reverend John C. Lord, DD, a firm nativist and anti- Catholic, about the administration of the hospital, arguing that three Sisters alone was not proper for the management of an entire hospital. He was enraged, seeing it not only as a religious threat but a political concern.  Letter- writing feud  A hospital hallway in 1848. On 16 February 1850, the Saturday edition of The Buffalo Morning Express published an anonymous letter to the editor condemning the state legislature for providing public funding for Sisters of Charity Hospital \\"without securing the rights of the public therein or requiring any of the usual guarantees of the appropriation of that money. Much dissatisfaction has been felt and expressed in regard to the actions of the legislature.\\" The letter was written by Reverend Lord under his admitted pseudonym \\"Constituents\\". The inflammatory message resulted in a series of letters from both the Diocese of Buffalo and \\"Constituents\\", all published by The Buffalo Morning Express, a Whig Party-dominated and strongly anti-Catholic publication. Bishop Timon expressed dismay when shown the letter, and two days later The Buffalo Morning Express published a reply letter, in which he wrote that the Sisters of Charity Hospital was an \\"institution resting on the broad lines of charity, without reference to creed, color or country.\\" Reverend Lord wrote a heated letter in reply, calling the idea of the hospital as charitable \\"ridiculous\\". He contended that the hospital funding was granted to win political favor, as it was granted just prior to an election. Bishop Timon responded with a letter implying that bigotry towards the charity of the Catholic Church is the reason for the letters written by \\"Constituents.\\" Bishop Timon then tasked Vicar General Fr. Bernard O'Reilly with the letter- writing feud while he focused on acquiring further state funds to expand the hospital and build an orphanage and school for the deaf. Reverend Lord, through his pseudonym, responded in his own defense, stating that \\"Roman Catholic institutions, charitable if they please to call them so\\" are not what is opposed by Protestants, only the fact that the state legislature is \\"[funding] not a public hospital but a Roman Catholic one,\\" and were \\"willing to do for the Papists what they have never done for their own religious institutions.\\" He accused the government of being in collaboration with the Catholic Church, arguing that the funding was illegal. He warned that Sisters of Charity Hospital would make \\"citizens become subjects of Romish magic,\\" and asked \\"are Roman Catholics to be almoners of Protestant charities to the poor and destitute?\\" In another letter, he asserted that the hospital funding was illegal because \\"not a single Protestant is in the Corporation or has any supervision of its affairs.\\" In the Christian Advocate, a Protestant newspaper at which Reverend Lord was editor, he questioned why anyone who defends the Constitution \\"will be willing to be taxed to build up an institution the control of which is beyond the votes of a free republican people.\\" Vicar General Fr. O'Reilly responded with a letter the next day reminding that the hospital existed to provide \\"corporeal mercy\\" for the sick and injured and that \\"the doors of that institution are as free to the clergy of one denomination of believers as they are to that of another.\\" In yet another letter, Reverend Lord wrote falsehoods about the Sisters and the hospital: \\"‚Ä¶had not the migrating body of sisters abandoned their location in another state‚Ä¶ May not the hospital here be closed at any time by the departure of its inmates to a new locality?\\" He also accused the Sisters of providing Catholic priests for patients who requested Protestant ministers and of offering patients free treatment if they converted to Catholicism. In reality, Bishop Timon, carefully recognizing the risk of proselytizing in such a hostile area, specifically forbad the Sisters of Charity from ever mentioning religion to Protestants unless one initiated the topic independently. Lord then published the statements of two former patients, who testified that Sister Ursula Mattingly, the director of the hospital, improperly treated non-Catholic patients, was not \\"properly trained in the medicines,\\" and was a foreigner. One, named Michael Murphy, swore out an affidavit on 1 March 1850. He reported that Reverend Lord offered him clothes and enough money to travel to Canada, where he was relocating, if he would tell the \\"emigrant agent office\\" that he was treated poorly by the Sisters of Charity. While Bishop Timon's and \\"Constituents,\\" or Reverend Lord's letters were prolific during the month of February, by March Buffalo had a more pressing concern: a cholera epidemic was reaching its height after several months. Bishop Timon abruptly ceased responding to Reverend Lord's public letters; he was too busy with his efforts procuring additional state funding to expand the hospital. Also on his mind was the longterm missions of literally building a diocese from the ground up. New parishes, schools, colleges, seminaries, and an orphanage were needed to serve the growing Catholic population, who now made up more than half the population of Buffalo. Reverend Lord published one last attack in The Buffalo Morning Express on 2 March 1850, warning local Protestants that Catholic priests and nuns seek \\"the conversion of Protestant children to the Romish faith.\\" He warned, \\"beware of the Romish priesthood,\\" claiming they ignore their vows of celibacy and use the Catholic Church for profit. In 1850, after months of public feuding between the Catholic and Protestant leaders of Buffalo, the New York State Legislature passed multiple bills denying additional funding to Sisters of Charity Hospital. The laws were pushed through by State Assemblyman John Putnam, a close friend of Reverend Lord, who wrote of the events in his memoir, \\"the apostate and tyranny of Rome was discovered and the State wisely chose to listen to the people for there is a law greater than the Constitution.\\" In 1851, the esteemed Buffalo Medical Journal published an assessment of Sisters of Charity Hospital's performance during the 1849‚Äì1850 cholera epidemic, giving the Daughters of Charity (the Sisters of Charity changed their name in 1850) overwhelming praise, stating that: > \\"each patient admitted to the Hospital was at once placed under the charge > of one of the Sisters and received her unceasing care. The degree of > patience and endurance exhibited by the Sisters of charity in their > unwearied labors of mercy was a matter of astonishment not less than of > admiration.\\" The report also praised the hospital in its continuation \\"that whatever credit is due to the Institution for the large proportion of recoveries belongs to those under whose immediate charge the Institution is placed.\\" Sisters of Charity Hospital in 1870.  Expansion  In 1852 and again in 1853, the State gave $7,000 to Sisters of Charity Hospital (equivalent to $414,815 in 2015 dollars) for the hospital expansion and construction of an orphanage. The funding was independent of any State Legislature decision, and was provided in exchange for the hospital providing care for impoverished foreigners. For this service, the hospital also received annual per capita payments from 1851 to 1860 from the State Commissioners of Immigration. Meanwhile, things were looking up both politically and socially for the hospital and its public image. The famously anti-Catholic and nativist Whig Party was largely declining in Erie County, with the rise of the more tolerant Democratic and Republican Parties. Even Whig-Catholic relations were somewhat improved, with one faction of the party promising state funding for Catholic schools and institutions. Buffalo's Protestants no longer openly protested Sisters of Charity Hospital's state funding, and Bishop Timon began strengthening his ties to Protestants, to the point where he was able to construct a Catholic cathedral right near the Episcopal cathedral with no significant fanfare. Three Daughters of Charity at the hospital during the late 1800s. In 1854, using the state funding, the Daughters of Charity began expanding in Buffalo, founding St. Mary's Infant Asylum and Maternity Hospital at Elmwood and Edward Streets. It served nearly entirely orphans and unwed mothers, leaving the main hospital more space for the average ill person. In closed in 1951. In 1860, Bishop Timon requested the Daughters of Charity open an institution for the mentally ill. They obliged, and Providence Retreat was established that same year at the current Sisters of Charity Hospital location at Main and Humboldt Streets, a 30-acre sight purchased from Dr. Austin Flint, who was the first chief of medical staff at the hospital. Even with multiple specialty facilities, Buffalo was growing faster than the healthcare system could. It was clear that the Sisters of Charity Hospital's original location, at Pearl Place, was much too small. A new site at Main and Delvan Streets was acquired, and a new 300-bed hospital was finished in 1876. From the five-year period of 1877‚Äì1882, 4,420 patients were cared for at a total expense of $19,000, half of whom were charity cases. Dr. James Patrick Kinney performs a surgery in the 1940s. By 1884, the Daughters of Charity in Buffalo ran four hospitals: Sisters of Charity hospital for the sick, St. Mary's Infant Asylum and Maternity Hospital for orphans and unwed mothers, Providence Retreat for the mentally ill and Emergency Hospital, which opened in 1884. The Diocese of Buffalo took possession of Emergency Hospital in 1954. Today it is a private institution called Sheehan Memorial Hospital. Providence Retreat closed in 1940, and two years later the Sisters Hospital opened a branch, the St. Louise de Marillac Maternity Hospital in its former building. In 1948, Sisters of Charity Hospital moved to its present location. It merged St. Louise de Marillac Hospital with its own maternity unit, and the Daughters of Charity were back to running a diverse centralized hospital as they did in their early years.  Recent years  In 2002, Sister Sue O'Neill, DC, founded Sisters Hospital's groundbreaking massage therapy program, the first of its kind in the region. It has since expanded from just her to an entire department, and has spawned similar programs and nearby hospitals. O'Neill commented on the program to The Buffalo News in 2014: \\"When I started, it was just myself, and it was with a lot of resistance. Now, it‚Äôs huge. It‚Äôs a whole wing of the hospital.\\" As years went by, Sisters of Charity Hospital has added many additions to its facilities. The first, a 1948 addition, currently houses the hospital's Emergency Department, Family Health Center, patient rooms, and outpatient treatment areas. In 1965, a five-story addition was built, and contains administrative offices, the Maternity Department, patient rooms, conference areas, the Medical Record Department and physician lounge. Another 1967 addition holds the Pharmacy, Central Supply, Diagnostic Imaging, and Purchasing Departments. In 1974, two new additions were constructed. The first, the Seton Professional Building, contains medical and commercial offices and hospital extension offices. The St. Catherine Laboure Health Center, originally called the Skilled Nursing Facility, contains rehabilitative services, social work, and 80-bed skilled nursing center. Re- Vision 2000, a modernization push by the hospital, included a 1994 renovation, 1992 two-story addition containing new intensive care and coronary care units, 1992 new information services and finance building named after Sr. Mary Charles Dever, DC, former hospital President and CEO, and in 1993, a new Surgical Department. A new entrance, lobby, Admissions Department and ambulatory care wing were also constructed as part of Re-Vision 2000. In early June 2013, it was announced that the Daughters of Charity would be leaving Sisters of Charity Hospital for other ministries later that month after 166 years staffing the institution. Five Daughters, Sisters Mary Grace Higgins, Claire Edwards, Ann Paul Chenard, Sue O'Neill, and Mary Anne Brawley, were living and working at the hospital at the time of the move. Sister Janet Keim, DC, Provincial Councilor for the Daughters of Charity Province of St. Louise, cited the declining and aging number of Daughters, and a desire to staff current and new missions serving the materially poor. President and CEO Peter U. Bergmann expressed surprise and sadness at the news, although he affirmed that the order would continue their sponsorship of the hospital and membership on the Catholic Health System board. Over 850 Daughters of Charity have served at Sisters of Charity Hospital since its founding, and continued to lead the hospital as Presidents until 1992, when the first layperson assumed the post. Bishop Richard Malone celebrated a Mass in commemoration of the Daughters' long service at the hospital.  Operations   Present day  Survey data for the latest year available shows that 69,806 patients visited the hospital's emergency room. The hospital had a total of 18,587 admissions. Its physicians performed 6,586 inpatient and 19,720 outpatient surgeries.  List of administrators  The following is an incomplete list of the administrators of Sisters of Charity Hospital.

She was the daughter of senator and financier Fran√ßois Scholastique, Count of Gu√©h√©neuc. She was the sister of general Charles Louis Joseph Olivier, Count of Gu√©h√©neuc. Life On September 16, 1800, at the age of 18, she married general Jean Lannes (1769‚Äì1809) at Dornes, becoming his second spouse. The couple had five children: four sons (Napol√©on, Alfred, Ernest and Gustave) and one daughter (Jos√©phine). Following Lannes's death, their eldest son Napol√©on succeeded in his father's titles. Their three other sons used the courtesy title of baron. The Duchess of Montebello enjoyed a great deal of respect in the contemporary Parisian high society as a role model of aristocratic femininity. She was appointed dame d'honneur (Mistress of the Robes) to Empress Marie Louise by Napoleon I, a position she kept from 1810 until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. Montebello was described as a virtuous beauty with domestic values and Napoleon reportedly trusted and respected her and referred to her as a \\"true lady of honor\\".Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 She, however, did in fact not like him, reportedly because she blamed him for the death of her spouse.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 Her relationship to Marie Louise was very good, and she became a favorite of the empress.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 Court service After her arrival to France, Marie Louise was only allowed to keep one person of her Austrian entourage, her former governess countess Lazansky, who was her trusted confidante. Montebello, however, complained to Napoleon that she would not be able to act as a guide of the empress as long as she was allowed to keep her Austrian favorite, and Lazansky was therefore sent back to Vienna with Marie Louise's dog the same year.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 This was reportedly a traumatic event for Marie Louise, who had attached herself to Lazansky ever since her first governess, countess Colloredo, who had been as a mother for her, had left her position during her childhood.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 Lazansky was replaced by Montebello as the personal friend, confidant and favorite of the empress.

Montebello often spent the night in her apartment close to the empress, and Marie Louise, who lived very isolated and seldom left her rooms except for attending official occasions scheduled by Napoleon, used to visit her through a back passage, which allowed her to go directly to the room of Montebello without passing through the salon were her ladies-in-waiting spent their hours when they were in service, and the empress' way of favoring Montebello before all other courtiers caused offence and did not make her popular at court.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 During the tenure of Marie Louise as empress, the court was divided in three parties: the party of the recently new career aristocracy, who had been ennobled by Napoleon, was led by the duchess of Montebello and had the support of the emperor; the party of the old nobility of the l'ancien regime, who was led by the governess of Napoleon II, Louise Charlotte Fran√ßoise de Montesquiou, who had Napoleon's respect; and the military party, led by G√©raud Duroc.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 Montebello was a great support for Marie Louise during her childbirth, when she slept in her bedroom to support her.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 She stood by Marie Louise's side during her first regency in 1813, and accompanied her on her trip to Normandy with de Lucay.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 During Marie Louise's second regency in 1814, she accompanied the empress when she fled Paris in March to Blois in the entourage of Dr. Corvisart and her ladies-in-waiting de Lugay, de Castiglione and Moritalivet.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 When Marie Louise was encouraged to return to Paris before the Bourbons did to secure the throne for her son after the abdication of Napoleon, she was reportedly willing to do so after a conversation with her dame d'announce Mme Durand, but changed her mind and decided to stay on the advise of Montebello and Corvisart.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 Montebello also convinced Marie Louise to accept the suggestion to go to Austria rather than to join Napoleon on his exile in Elba.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 Montebello joined Marie Louise on her trip to Austria after the fall of Napoleon. However, she was soon replaced as the head of Marie Louise's court by the Contessa de Brignole, despite the protest of Marie Louise; partially because Austria wished to have all her French courtiers replaced, and partially because she herself did not wish to continue her service in exile and wanted to be near her children.Cuthell, Edith E: An imperial victim : Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, Empress of the French, Duchess of Parma, 1911 See also * Ad√©la√Øde de La Rochefoucauld  References  Category:19th-century French people Category:Dukes of Montebello Category:1782 births Category:1856 deaths Category:French ladies-in-waiting Category:Mistresses of the Robes (France) Category:People of the First French Empire ","title":"Louise Antoinette Lannes, Duchess of Montebello"},{"id":"21588362","text":"Paomet (also called Pamet) was a tribe of Native Americans living near the Pamet River in modern Cape Cod in the 1620s..

John Armstrong, commander of Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico, visited Hobbs to conduct a preliminary investigation of potential military sites and discuss the prospects with local political and business leaders. Other military representatives soon followed, including those of the Army Corps of Engineers who would be involved in construction. The Army Air Force decided to use the Hobbs location in February 1942http://www.airfields- freeman.com/NM/Airfields_NM_SE.htm and began the planning of the base and shipment of materials, but a public announcement was not made until 7 April. In a lease agreement with the city of Hobbs, signed on 4 February 1942, the city was responsible for acquiring \\"either through voluntary purchase or condemnation\\" the required for the airfield as well as 12 to for a radio communications installation, adjacent to the airfield for an ordnance installation, land for a sewage disposal system, and land for a rail spur. The city would lease these lands to the government for $1.00 a year with a 25-year renewal option.Dodge, William A., and Sawyer, Timothy L., \\"Keep \\"Em Flying: The Story of the Hobbs Army Air Field\\", Van Citters: Historic Preservation, LLC, Albuquerque, New Mexico, February 2008, pages 4-5. In April 1942 the city of Hobbs passed a $26,000 bond issue for land acquisition along the west side of the Hobbs-Lovington Highway, comprising the ranches of the Caudill and Huston families. The Huston family had spent 40 years building up their property and were not happy about being dispossessed. The city was adamant and the case was eventually settled in district court. The property had to be cleared by June 1942.Dodge and Sawyer, page 5 The Army Corps of Engineers, Albuquerque District, opened a sub-district office in Hobbs on 16 March 1942. On 1 April, Wilson and Company of Salina, Kansas, was awarded a $65,000 architect-engineer contract to design and build the new installation.Dodge and Sawyer, page 7 Construction contracts were issued to three experienced firms. \\"The firm of Parks, Marshall & McClosky was awarded a contract to build 423 buildings (later modified to include 456 structures) by the end of December, 1942. Hayner & Bruner had a contract to install the utilities on the base, and three Albuquerque firms partnered to form Allison, Armstrong & Thygesen, who then contracted to build the landing fields, roads, and drainage system.\\" Dodge and Sawyer, page 7 Grading of the runways began on 1 June 1942 with 100 workers initially, later to expand to 3,000, to meet a mid-September deadline on the $10.8 million project. Road construction was simultaneously undertaken including the rebuilding of the Hobbs-Lovington Highway to military requirements, and the access road to the base now known as Jack Gomez Boulevard.Dodge and Sawyer, page 8 The first mission of Hobbs Army Airfield, as a bombardier school for the United States Army Air Forces, began with the arrival of 80 cadets and 20 instructors on 7 September 1942. This was to be the only class of bombardiers, and 69 of the original 80 cadets graduated from the program on 21 November 1942.Dodge and Sawyer, page 21 While the bombardiers were still training, the West Coast Training Command ordered that Hobbs Army Airfield would become a multi-engine pilot training school, making it one of three B-17 training bases in the U.S. The first B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft arrived at the base in mid-December 1942, along with the first class of 46 four-engine pilots. Hollywood actor and Air Force pilot Jimmy Stewart was among them. One hundred four-engine aircraft mechanics as well as pilot instructors arrived at the same time. The total number of cadets training as Officer Student Pilots peaked in early 1945 when there were a total of 162 B-17 aircraft at the base.Dodge and Sawyer, page 22 In either 1943 or 1944 Hobbs issued a booklet entitled \\"Hobbs Army Air Field\\" that is extraordinary because its last page is devoted to African-American soldiers, including a baseball team posed in their uniforms.Hobbs Army Airfield Booklet http://www.hobbshistory.com/haaf4.html Few publications then from bases training white soldiers ever mentioned or depicted African-American soldiers. This team calls to mind that in the movie \\"A Soldier's Story\\". The need for B-17 pilot training declined in May 1945 as the war in Europe ended. By the end of 1945 the mission of the base had changed to be one of mothballing and temporary storage of aircraft. By August 1946 a total of 1,600 airplanes had been flown to Hobbs Army Airfield for storage, including the Douglas A-26 Invader and P-51 Mustang.Dodge and Sawyer, page 22 Hobbs Army Airfield was decommissioned by the United States Air Force on 5 May 1948 and the land reacquired by the City of Hobbs, New Mexico later that year. In 1987 the Soaring Society of America located its headquarters at Hobbs Army Airfield, constructing a building near the old flight line and using the runway for launching gliders and holding national soaring competitions.Dodge and Sawyer, page iii Today the airfield is part of the Hobbs Industrial Airpark, a non- flying light business facility.

Like the other novels in the series, it is set in the same universe but focuses on different characters.  Plot summary  The novel begins with Aislinn and Seth arguing over their relationship, as Seth's mortality, Aislinn's immortality, and her ties to Keenan as the summer queen make a normal relationship near impossible. Meanwhile, Bananach visits her twin sister, the High Queen Sorcha, telling her of Aislinn and Seth's relationship as well as predictions of impending war. Curious about Seth, Sorcha orders Devlin, her brother and advisor, to follow Seth to see if he is any threat to the balance of the Faery courts. Niall offers Seth the protection of the Dark Court, which means that threats or violence against Seth would be treated as a threat or violence against the court as a whole. Niall explains that this would protect him against any potential threat from Keenan in the event that the Faery king decided to dispose of him. Due to it being the summer season, Aislinn and Keenan are growing more physically attracted to each other as the king and queen of the summer fae. During this time, the Winter Queen, Donia, grows increasingly unsatisfied with the relationship between herself and Keenan, telling him that his attraction to Aislinn must stop so that she can be the only one in his life. She escalates a confrontation initiated by Aislinn to physical injury. In the fallout of Keenan healing Aislinn, Seth calls for a break in their relationship. After leaving, Seth is abducted by Bananach, who takes him to Sorcha. Sorcha offers to make Seth a powerful faery capable of using her own powers as long as he stays with her for one month each year. During his time in Faerie, Seth develops a mother/son relationship with Sorcha, gaining great influence in her court as well as a strong connection with her. Seth, however, is unaware that one day in Faerie is six days in the mortal world and his long disappearance crushes Aislinn. Aislinn attempts to find him, not knowing that Keenan, Niall, and Donia are aware of where he is. Keenan chooses not to tell Aislinn because it would cause her to have conflicts with the High Court and breaks up with Donia in an unsuccessful attempt to woo Aislinn. Niall eventually goes to visit Seth, who is perfectly happy in Faerie, except for his longing for Aislinn. He then tells Niall of his deal with Sorcha, and tells him not to worry about him. Sorcha tells Niall not to tell Seth too much about what is going on in the outside world and especially not to tell Aislinn about his being there. At this point Seth has been missing for five months and believing him gone for good, Aislinn attempts to seduce Keenan but is rebuffed. Keenan tells Aislinn that he will only sleep with her once she really loves him. Upon his return from Faerie, Aislinn and Keenan are surprised to see that Seth has returned and that he is now a powerful faery with strong ties and influence in Sorcha's court. Keenan runs to Donia to beg for her forgiveness, but is rebuffed by her. Seth discovers that Aislinn has been dating Keenan and blames her for not having faith in their relationship. The novel ends with Seth getting permission to train with Gabriel's Hounds so he can hunt down Bananach.

A type of melanocytic nevus, it affects the epidermis and dermis.LeBoit, PE, Burg G, Weedon D, Sarasin A. (Eds) World Health Organization Classification of Tumours: Pathology and Genetics of Skin Tumours. Lyon: IARCPress. 2006. It is also known as an epithelioid and spindle-cell nevus,, and misleadingly as a benign juvenile melanoma, and Spitz's juvenile melanoma). The name juvenile melanoma is generally no longer used as it is neither a melanoma, nor does it occur only in children.Crotty, K.

Pathophysiology Micrograph of a Spitz nevus showing the characteristic vertically arranged nests of cells (\\"hanging bananas\\"). H&E; stain. The cause of Spitz nevi is not yet known. There is an association with sunburn, but causation is not established. Genetic studies of Spitz nevi have shown that most cells have the normal number of chromosomes, however a minority (25%) of cells have been shown to contain extra copies of parts of some chromosomes, such as the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p). Diagnosis differential diagnoses of pigmented skin lesions, by relative incidence and malignancy potential, including \\"Spitz, Reed or spindle nevus\\" at top right. On histopathology, Spitz nevi characteristically have vertically arranged nests of nevus cells that have both a spindled and an epithelioid morphology. Apoptotic cells may be seen at the dermoepidermal junction. The main histologic differential diagnoses are pigmented spindle cell nevus and malignant melanoma. Treatment Surgical removal is usually performed, even though it is benign. Epidemiology Spitz nevi are uncommon. Their annual incidence was estimated in a coastal population of sub-tropical Queensland to be 1.4 cases per 100,000 people. For comparison, the annual incidence of melanoma in the same population, which is high by world standardsRies LAG, et al., eds. SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975‚Äì2000. Bethesda, MD: National Cancer Institute; 2003: Tables XVI-1-9. is 25.4 cases per 100,000 people. Although they are most commonly found on people in their first two decades of life, the age range for people with Spitz nevi is from 6 months to 71 years, with a mean age of 22 years and a median age of 19 years.

The molecules are transported by caveolae (rather than clathrin-coated vesicles) and are deposited directly into the cytosol. Like other types of receptor-mediated endocytosis, potocytosis typically begins when an extracellular ligand binds to a receptor protein on the surface of a cell, thus beginning the formation of an endocytotic vesicle. The ligand is usually of low molecular mass (e.g. vitamins), but some larger molecules (such as lipids) can also act as ligands. Mechanism Lipid rafts in the plasma membrane act as membrane microdomains. They are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and are involved potocytosis as the lateral compartmentalization of molecules. Caveolae are caveolin-1-enriched smooth invaginations found on these lipid rafts that contribute to transportation of molecules. Potocytosis works by taking up material into caveolae at the surface of the cell. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored class of membrane proteins generate high concentrations of molecules. This may either be by releasing a receptor bound molecule, by converting molecules enzymatically or by releasing them from a carrier protein.

Brint (1620) Saint Gualfardo of Verona (or Wolfhard of Augsburg) (1070‚Äì1127) was a Swabian artisan, trader, and hermit who lived around Verona. A hagiographical vita (biography) was composed, according to the Bollandists, within decades of his death, probably towards the end of the twelfth century. In the early sixteenth century he was venerated as the patron saint of the harnessmakers' guild at Verona. Gualfardo was born in Augsburg, the chief city of Swabia at the time. In 1096 he was on a pilgrimage--German Wallfahrer means pilgrim, whence his Italian nameHis Latin name is Gualfardus, which alternatively may derive from the German name Wolfhard.--from Augsburg \\"with some journeyman merchants\\", according to his vita. He stopped in Verona, where he lived for a time with a journeyman, though he was a master harnessmaker by trade. Of this brief period his vita says: In eodem vero loco beatissimus Gualfardus in sellarum exercitio (nam optimus sellator erat) parvo tempore moratus (in that very place the most blessed Gualfardo worked on saddles [for the best saddler he was] but for a short time). He eventually settled in a dense forest on the Adige not far from Verona. There he lived for twenty years before he was found by hunters, who brought him back to Verona. He established a shop near the abbey of San Salvatore, but during a flood he left the city again and built a hermit's cell near the church of Santa Trinit√† in the countryside nearby. Until his death he was well sought after by the Veronese for his miracles. He does not seem to have been an especial aid to travelers, though his love of solitude did not interfere with his hospitality to city-dwellers, who also brought him food. He died at Curte-Regia near Verona in 1127. References *Vauchez, Andr√©. 1993 The Laity in the Middle Ages: Religious Beliefs and Devotional Practices. Daniel E. Bornstein (ed.) and Margery J.

Similar to other cleats in the Elite series (T90, CTR, SUPERFLY), the chassis of the Legend Elite is made of carbon fiber to reduce weight. The Elite version of the Legend III instead uses a new material called Kanga-Lite. Kanga-Lite is a water-resistant synthetic material that mimics the feel and touch of kangaroo leather while maintaining its performance in all conditions. The first Elite version was released in Metallic Mach/Purple/Total Orange exclusively for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Subsequently the Tiempo has been released under the 10R (Ronaldinho). Ronaldinho has his own version called Ronaldinho Dois. On 1 July 2010, The Nike Tiempo Legend III was released in two colorways: Black/White/Volt and Metallic White/Chilling Red. Subsequent colorways include White/Seaweed/Sport Red, Pearl/Black/Team Orange, White/Black/Del Sol, Black/White/Gold and Metallic Mach/Purple/Total Orange (only available in the Elite versions of the Nike Tiempo). Nike Tiempo IV Elite White/Gold/Volt colorway The launch of the Tiempo Legend IV on 1 July 2011 marked a change in Nike's management of the Tiempo line, introducing an 'Elite' level boot at the time of launch (rather than partway through the boot's lifespan, as with the Legend III). Whilst the Tiempo Legend IV received several notable updates, including a synthetic 'KangaLite' Leather midfoot and heel to improve stability and the removal of the classic Tiempo tongue, Nike's marketing surrounding the line focused on the Tiempo Legend IV Elite. Featuring Flywire similar to that on the Superfly III, full Carbon Fibre-chassis and 'Premium' kangaroo leather, the Tiempo Legend IV Elite was Nike's lead boot for the autumn of 2011. Launching in Black/White/Total Orange, the Tiempo Legend IV Elite was the most expensive Tiempo ever, costing ¬£275 (over US$315). The Nike Tiempo Legend V was launched in December 2013 in Desert Sand/Atomic Orange/Black. This updated version of the Tiempo is 0.8 ounces lighter than its predecessor. Nike's ACC (All Conditions Control) and Hypershield technologies are designed to reduce water uptake, a common problem with natural leather boots. The Nike Tiempo Legend VI had a more seamless feel, and super-soft leather. The Nike Tiempo Legend VII was the first version to include Flyknit. The result is a boot with enhanced fit and comfort that is 22% lighter than its predecessor. To help prevent overstretching of the leather toebox, Nike developed Fit-Mesh, which made its debut in the Tiempo Legend VII. also the legend 8 has an upper similar to the magistas only little bit better in almost everything though.  Special editions  In 2015, special edition Nike Tiempos were released to commemorate the careers of Ronaldinho and Francesco Totti. They became the most expensive Tiempos in history, costing ‚Ç¨300. They were individually numbered and only 3,000 of each were made. Shin guards Nike Tiempo shin guards are made out of polypropylene shell for comfortable and durable protection.

The ureohydrolase superfamily includes arginase (), agmatinase (), formiminoglutamase () and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (). These enzymes share a 3-layer alpha-beta-alpha structure, and play important roles in arginine/agmatine metabolism, the urea cycle, histidine degradation, and other pathways. Arginase, which catalyses the conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine, is one of the five members of the urea cycle enzymes that convert ammonia to urea as the principal product of nitrogen excretion. There are several arginase isozymes that differ in catalytic, molecular and immunological properties. Deficiency in the liver isozyme leads to argininemia, which is usually associated with hyperammonemia. Agmatinase hydrolyses agmatine to putrescine, the precursor for the biosynthesis of higher polyamines, spermidine and spermine. In addition, agmatine may play an important regulatory role in mammals. Formiminoglutamase catalyses the fourth step in histidine degradation, acting to hydrolyse N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate to L-glutamate and formamide. Proclavaminate amidinohydrolase is involved in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Clavulanic acid acts as an inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes that are used by various microorganisms to resist beta-lactam antibiotics. As a result, this enzyme improves the effectiveness of beta-lactamase antibiotics.

He was the eldest son of Erard I of Chacenay and Mathilde de Donzy. Life In 1209 Erard, with the consent of his unnamed wife, confirmed a donation to Basse-Fontaine by a certain Agnete, specified as domina of Chacenay, probably his grandmother Agnes de Brienne. During the succession crisis of Champagne, Erard was the strongest support of Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt and was the last to reconcile with Blanche of Navarre. Uneasy with the result in Champagne, Erard took part in the Fifth Crusade (1217), but was back in Europe by 1220. In July 1219 Erard's cousin, Herv√©, Count of Nevers, confirmed a donation Erard had made to the Teutonic Knights, while Erard was at the siege of Damietta. Upon his return, Erard paid homage to Theobald, Count of Champagne and made a donation to the convent of Argensolles, which had been founded by Blanche of Navarre. He was a patron of the trouv√®re Guiot de Dijon. He was buried in the Abbey of Clairvaux, 16 June 1236. Marriage and issue Erard was the second husband of Emmeline (Emelina) de Broyes (died 1249, before April), widow of Odo II of Champlitte. They were married in 1205. In 1218 she made a joint donation with her husband to the Abbey of Moutier-la-Celle. Erard was faced with a possible divorce when he sold his step-daughter, Oda's, inheritance to the Knights Templar.

He is the bassist and keyboardist of the hard rock band Wolfmother. Peres joined the band in January 2009 as Andrew Stockdale found new members after Chris Ross and Myles Heskett quit in 2008. The same year that Peres joined Wolfmother, the band released their second studio album Cosmic Egg. Career In an interview with Toazted in 2011, Stockdale revealed that former drummer Dave Atkins had suggested Ian Peres when the band were looking for a bassist. Peres responded by saying that he was \\"very excited by the prospect of playing with a band that he had always admired in the past.\\" Peres has played bass and keyboards in both Cosmic Egg and New Crown; the band's second and third albums respectively. Peres contributed towards the engineering, editing and audio mixing in New Crown along with Kevin Garcia Fernandez. In between the release of the band's second and third studio album, Peres worked with bandmate Andrew Stockdale for the release of his debut solo record Keep Moving, which was originally intended to be a Wolfmother record. During this period, the band briefly split up before cancelling Stockdale's tour for his solo album and within a few months of the release of the record, Wolfmother was reformed. Peres recorded bass, organ, piano and banjo, whilst also contributing with Pro Tools editing on Keep Moving. After the release of New Crown in 2014, Wolfmother released their fourth studio album Victorious in February 2016. With Stockdale recording bass on all tracks of the album, Peres contributed with only organ tracks. However, he toured with the band during their worldwide Gypsy Caravan Tour of their newly released album, where he performed backing vocals for the first time during his ongoing reign with Wolfmother. In recent years, Peres has toured and performed with musicians including Jarryd James, Ash Grunwald and Xavier Rudd. Equipment Peres plays Korg keyboards, primarily a Korg CX-3. He has also been seen playing Mosrite and Fender bass guitars. He mostly plays the Fender Precision Bass.

From independently releasing his first studio release, I'm Only Beginning in 1983, Joseph's career has spanned over thirty years. In 2004, he won the Best Male Artist Category in the BBC Welsh Music Awards. Early life Born in Penarth, Wales, Joseph grew up as an avid golfer, having started to play at the age of 10. At 15 years old, he was playing off a handicap of one, and at 17, he became the youngest ever winner of the Glamorganshire Golf Club Championship. He has won that title four times and also played for the County of Glamorgan and in the British Youths and Amateur Championships in the 1980s. Joseph remains a keen amateur golfer and plays with a handicap of four. However, Joseph would gradually focus his career path on music. Growing up, he participated in school eisteddfods and, at his own estimate, he had already written several songs by his early teens. Recording career Early career (1983‚Äì1998) Joseph began recording in 1983, releasing five albums over the 1980s, culminating in his 1989 self- financed An Aching and a Longing (Myrrh Records), which sold 30,000 copies and gained him a large enough following that he was subsequently signed to Sony Records. He made his major label debut with Being There in 1992. It was produced by Ben Wisch, to create more stripped-down arrangements. Joseph worked musically with Pete Brookes, while collaborating with lyricist Stewart Henderson on many of the tracks. A year after the release of Being There, Joseph recorded live versions of the songs featured on the album and released it under the title Undrugged. His second and final release under Sony, the self-titled Martyn Joseph, was produced by Mick Glossop, whose previous work included albums with The Waterboys. The first single from Martyn Joseph, \\"Talk About It in the Morning\\" co-written with Tom Robinson, was released in 1995 and reached the Top 50 in the UK Singles Chart. Joseph's brief major label career produced five Top 50 singles total in the UK, including \\"Dolphins Make Me Cry\\", \\"Working Mother\\", \\"Being There\\" and \\"Let's Talk About it in The Morning.\\" Prior to 2003's Whoever It Was That Brought Me Here Will Have To Take Me Home, Being There and Martyn Joseph were the only albums of his to have been released in the United States. After being dropped by Sony, he recorded two albums for the UK independent record label Grapevine: Full Colour Black and White and Tangled Souls. His first release under Grapevine featured the fourth track \\"Ballad of Richard Lewis\\", a homage to the Welsh labourer and hero better known as Dic Penderyn, who was sentenced to death after leading the Merthyr Rising of 1831. The song would be later included in further albums (including the Thunder and Rainbows compilation, the Don't Talk About Love live album, and Evolved, as a re-recording in a different style) as \\"Dic Penderyn\\". Pipe Records (1999‚Äìpresent) In 1999, Joseph established his own label, Pipe Records, citing \\"creative freedom\\" and \\"complete control\\" as the main advantages granted him that were not possible working under other labels. Drawing from possible past experiences with Sony, Joseph explains, \\"I'm not dependent on Robbie Williams' diary or Madonna's film schedule for when [my songs] get released.\\" Joseph began publishing work under a new medium, a news magazine entitled The Passport Queue, the name of which is taken from a line in the song \\"Everything in Heaven\\". Subscribers of the magazine receive free annual CDs of rare recordings. In his first release under Pipe Records, Far From Silent, Joseph explored the complications of fame and fortune, in the second track \\"Celebrity\\". The eighth track, entitled \\"The Good in Me is Dead\\", written in the perspective of a Kosovo refugee in light of the Balkan atrocities, reflects Joseph's penchant for writing about social tragedies and injustice. \\"The prime motive in the instant that I pick up the guitar is a selfish one,\\" Joseph says. \\"It's because I need to deal with the world. I'm in the world and it's horrible, and what can I do? I'm just getting this stuff out of my system as it were.\\" Between Far From Silent and his next LP, Joseph came out with several works, the first of which was a 2000 limited edition EP, The Shirley Sessions, which he worked on primarily during a tour with Shirley Bassey gone awry. The next year, in 2001, Joseph compiled a two- disc best-of album entitled Thunder and Rainbows ‚Äì The Best We Could Find comprising 31 of his previous favourites and two new songs. Following his first best-of compilation, he came out with his second live album, two volumes of recordings under the title Don't Talk About Love 1992 ‚Äì 2002. Joseph performing live with lyricist Stewart Henderson. In November 2003, Joseph released his second LP under Pipe Records, Whoever It Was That Brought Me Here Will Have To Take Me Home. Soon thereafter, Joseph began a serious collaboration with Tom Robinson and Steve Knightley, whom he worked with extensively early in his career. The result was the 2004 release, Faith, Folk and Anarchy, as well as an eventual live accompaniment, Faith, Folk & Anarchy Live. The next year brought three more releases from Joseph. In the midst of the controversial war in Iraq, Joseph's next album, Deep Blue, featured the highly political tracks \\"Yet Still This Will Not Be\\" and \\"How Did We End Up Here\\". Joseph mused in an interview with a folk music website, \\"I bet, in his private moments alone, deep down, Tony Blair the person regrets what he did in Iraq\\". The Bridgerow Sessions and Because We Can..., further collaborated on with Steve Knightley and Stewart Henderson respectively, rounded out the year. A regular performer at the annual Greenbelt Festival in the United Kingdom, Joseph recorded his 2006 performance and released it as MJGB06. The same year, he came out with his first live effort recorded on DVD, Martyn Joseph Live. A two-day stint in Las Vegas would precede his following LP released in 2007 and would prove to be highly influential, inspiring the album's title, Vegas, and its title-track. Another track on the album, \\"Kindness\\", was, on the other hand, inspired by the homeless situation in Toronto, Ontario. The album exhibited a generally edgier sound, featuring electric guitar. In October 2008, Joseph released Evolved, a new full-length album featuring 14 newly recorded tracks of songs in Joseph's previous catalogue, but played in a different style than its original recording. He felt that the songs found in his albums no longer reflected the manner in which he played them live. The songs are uniquely presented exactly as Joseph played it in studio without any overdubbing or additional instrumentation. In January 2009, at the height of the Israeli attack on Gaza, Joseph released \\"Five Sisters\\", a track paying homage to the five sisters who were killed by an Israeli shell supposedly meant to hit a mosque. Later that year, Joseph released another live album entitled Official Bootleg Series ‚Äì Volume 1 ‚Äì Live Cuts 92‚Äì08. As the title suggests, the album compiled an assortment of official bootlegs spanning performances from 1992 to 2008. During a 31-date tour of the United Kingdom, beginning in October 2010, Joseph's performances were recorded for a future live DVD release. Joseph later released Under Lemonade Skies, a 10-track LP. Touring Performing at Greenbelt Festival 2008 Joseph tours as a solo artist in the UK, and in the early 2000s he began touring in Canada and the United States. One of his songs, \\"All This Time\\" was borne of a trip through the Canadian wilderness. Of the track's inspiration, Joseph explains, \\"It humbles you visiting a place like that. Anyone who has an ego problem needs to backpack through Canada for a while.\\" He is also a regular performer at major Canadian folk festivals, including the Vancouver and Edmonton Folk Music Festivals, and at the annual Greenbelt Festival in the UK. Joseph has performed as a support act for a variety of artists, such as Chris de Burgh, Marc Cohn, Joan Armatrading, Art Garfunkel, Janis Ian, and Suzanne Vega. In June 2000, he left a tour with Shirley Bassey after only eight shows over what he described as \\"rather obvious artistic differences\\". Prior to the tour, he admitted in an interview with Cross Rhythms, \\"I've heard that she can be difficult...I figure that [my songs will] paint a slightly different picture to the one she will probably paint so I guess it's a sense of balance, it's a challenge.\\" Having unexpected time on his hands, he recorded an EP entitled The Shirley Sessions, which consisted of several songs written during the tour. In his early career, he experimented with an accompanied arrangement in his live shows, having been assigned drummer Pete Thomas from the Attractions by his Sony label. Activism Spanning his musical career, Joseph has campaigned for causes. Asked in an interview whether he considered himself primarily a musician or activist, Joseph replied, \\"I can't decide ... I guess it's all part and parcel of the same thing for me.\\" Focusing his attention towards trade justice, third world debt cancellation and human rights, Joseph has been involved with Brazil's MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra), Amnesty International, Christian Aid, Casa Alianza, the Stephen Lewis Foundation, Jubilee 2000 and Advantage Africa. In May 2004, in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Joseph released a five-track EP, The Great American Novel, with all proceeds designated to War Child. He worked on the recording with regular collaborators Tom Robinson and Steve Knightley. In 2014 he launched his \\"Let Yourself Trust\\", a not-for-profit organisation which aims to challenge injustice, educating via advocacy, campaigning for human rights, and raising issues otherwise ignored.
