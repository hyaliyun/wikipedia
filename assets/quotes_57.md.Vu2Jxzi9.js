During the 1936 Olympic Games, he represented Great Britain twice, his debut came in a 2‚Äì0 victory over China and his final game against Poland in a 5‚Äì4 loss. During the game against Poland he was booed by the crowd for body charging several players and knocking over Polish left winger Hubert Gad at a time when Great Britain were losing 5‚Äì1. In the 1950s and 1960s he was general manager of the Kelvin Hall exhibition centre in Glasgow. He died in 1965 due to lung cancer.

Edmond was the first Lord Athenry to permanently reside at Dunmore, County Galway. His father had been forced to vacate Athenry, which had been the family's seat since about 1537, due to incessant warfare and famine during the middle years of the sixteenth century. Yet even these lands were subject to raids, notably by Teige √ì Flaithbheartaigh in 1589. While he remained among the first class of the local gentry, his net worth and political influence were greatly diminished, and he was forced to mortgage and sell lands to merchants of The Tribes of Galway, many of whom became as prosperous and influential as his ancestors. The final destruction of the original seat of the lordship, Athenry, in 1597 by Red Hugh O'Donnell, marked the final destruction of his hopes of financial recovery.

The village is situated approximately 10 kilometres (six miles) south-west of Newbury and encompasses the smaller hamlet of Broad Layings within its Northern borders. It has a church, church (village) hall, sports club, youth football club, post office, nursery, infants and junior schools and a pub (The Rampant Cat). History An area of farmland, woodland and scattered houses until the mid-eighteenth century, when the new church was built (as a 'daughter church' to the much older ecclesiastical parish of East Woodhay). The village grew rapidly during and since the 1950s and is now much larger (in population terms) than the neighbouring and contiguous village of Highclere. Due to the village's proximity to the A34 road it was the scene of many demonstrations during \\"the third battle of Newbury\\" when the Newbury bypass was being built in the 1990s. Transport Woolton Hill is served by the Stagecoach bus service 7 and 7A from Newbury and Andover.http://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_19981_23%20&%2024%20%28Newbury%20-%20Burghclere%20via%20Ecchinswell%29.pdf Woodhay railway station used to serve the village on the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway until its closure in the 1960s. The road on which the station lie is still called 'Station Road'. The disused railway line became, in part, the route for the A34 Newbury Bypass. Governance The village of Woolton Hill is part of the civil parish of East Woodhay and is part of the East Woodhay ward of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council. Geography To the East/North-East of the village is an area of woodland known as \\"The Chase\\" which is managed by The National Trust. The Chase was significantly altered in 2010‚Äì2011, to achieve the following goals (1) Return it into a nature reserve as per its original gift terms (2) to remove parts of the woodlands for successful woodland management. A local water course runs through The Chase and has been dammed to form a small lake in the North Eastern end and it now contains an asphalted car-park. The chase is bounded by the A34 (Newbury bypass) to the North East. Nearby villages include Ball Hill, Penwood, Highclere, Wash Water and East Woodhay as well as the town of Newbury.  Housing Estates  There a few housing estates within Woolton Hill. These include Greenlands, Copnor, Harwood Rise, Paddock End, Harwood Place and Woolton Lodge Gardens. Paddock End was recently built and is a small estate encompassing around 12 houses. Harwood Place is currently under construction, with 49 houses (including six affordable houses) as well as including a children's play area and some community land. The new Harwood Place development suffered many objections on multiple occasions, yet it went through successfully. Harwood Place and Paddock End were both built on the former 'Harwood Paddock', which was supposedly protected from construction until the new Paddock End development was completed, which took up about 1/6 of the paddock. However, the new Harwood Place development will cover the rest of the field. Paddock End was constructed by Linden Homes, while Harwood Place is being constructed by Bloor Homes. Woolton Lodge Gardens is another small estate, only having around 15 houses within its borders. It was constructed in the late 1900s/early 2000s. The Copnor estate features a mix of bungalows and terraced houses. It was built in the second half on the 20th Century. Greenlands was built in the 1980s. There are two blocks of flats in the village; one being in Copnor, the other being Mason Court (which is near Harwood Rise). There is a private lane in the village called Tile Barn, which encompasses around 40 houses all built at different times. Tile Barn connects the north and south of the village and used to be the village's main road. There are also areas of the village where there are houses, including Broadlayings and the Trade Street area. Broadlayings is about a 1/5 of the size of the village. Trade Street area is where the former post office, pub and orphanage were. The Trade Street area takes up around 1/6 of the village's size.  Landmarks  Gainsborough Stud - owned by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (Ruler of Dubai) is located in Woolton Hill. The stud land covers a large area in the village.

Life John Mason was born in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, on 9 June 1920. He studied at Bridgnorth Grammar School in Shropshire, and then at Jesus College, Oxford, where he was a scholar. His university studies were interrupted by the Second World War: he won his scholarship in 1937, but did not obtain his first-class degree in history until 1948. During the war, he served with the Manchester Regiment and then in the Indian Army, reaching the rank of Major and working in the Mechanical Transport Training Centre as well as interpreting Urdu. In 1950, he began his association with Christ Church, Oxford, at which he would spend the remainder of his academic career. His first appointment was as a research lecturer, to deal with the papers of Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury; Salisbury, who was Prime Minister from 1886 to 1892 and 1895 to 1902, studied at Christ Church between 1847 and 1849, and his papers were at that time held by the college. He became a \\"Student\\" (the term used by Christ Church for Fellows of the college) in 1957, retiring in 1987, and was also college librarian (succeeding Nowell Myres) from 1962 until his retirement.McMullin, Janet. \\"In memoriam John Mason: Librarian of Christ Church 1962-1987\\" Christ Church Library Newsletter 6(1), 2009.

He also wrote a history of Bridgnorth and co-authored (with E. G. W. Bill) Christ Church and Reform, 1850‚Äì1867, looking at the changes in Oxford during the 19th century.

Founding In August 2000, after being hired as Executive Director of the Jazz Foundation, Wendy Oxenhorn discovered the organization had only left in the fund. She suggested organizing a fundraising concert at the Apollo Theater. When she was told they could not afford to rent the Apollo, Oxenhorn asked board member Jarrett Lilien for advice. Lilien told Oxenhorn he would pay to rent the Apollo. Oxenhorn conceived of the idea for the concerts during her first year as Executive Director of the JFA in 2000, after watching a 1994 documentary called A Great Day in Harlem about jazz musicians. The first concert, which took place in September 2001, raised $350,000 for the foundation's Jazz Musicians Emergency Fund, and over 65 jazz artists performed. The Foundation's emergency caseload had tripled and they were helping 150 musicians. Lauren Roberts joined the organization and together they ran it, handling an average of 10 cases a day. Because of the success of the A Great Night in Harlem, they initiated the Jazz in the Schools Program, which generated employment for more than 400 elderly musicians in New York City. The annual A Great Night in Harlem concerts were the organization's only major funding source. Lilien and his partners at E-Trade started the Musicians Emergency Housing Fund, which enabled the Jazz Foundation to pay rents and keep mortgages from foreclosure. The Jazz Foundation of America supported hundreds of elderly musicians.Jazz Foundation of America . 2009-10-11. Jarrett Lilien became the first president of the JFA.

It began in 2008, is funded by the Department for Education and is managed by the British Council. Every year in July and August 100 young people are sent to Brazil, China or India to investigate issues of culture, language, education and global enterprise. The fully funded six week journey is an investigation into the social, economic and environmental effects of globalisation and learning what a positive role those on the programme can play in the process. The programme is typically split into three parts; two weeks language and cultural immersion, two weeks in a local school and staying with a host family, and two weeks as the guest of a global company. The first two weeks involve daily language classes, combined with cultural activities and visits. This part of the programme is designed to give practical language skills and an understanding of etiquette and culture. The activities and visits are aimed at giving an insight into the contrasts inherent in the emerging economies, and the drivers behind their rapid growth. The middle fortnight is centered on staying with a peer from the host country. By experiencing school life while living with a host family, Fellows get the opportunity to compare how education can shape the expectations of young people on opposite sides of the world. The global companies involved in 2009 were B&Q;/Kingfisher, Cadbury Schweppes, Cambridge University Press, G4S, GKN, Hays plc, HSBC, IMI plc, KPMG, Pearson Education, RSA Insurance Group, Royal Dutch Shell, Tata Consultancy Services, Virgin Atlantic and Jones Lang Lasalle. Each company took a number of Fellows, many in more than one of the countries, and provided a placement which demonstrated business in a global environment. New partners in 2010 include Arup and Natura. The main aims of the programme are to educate Britain's young generation to understand the opportunities and challenges for them in the new global economy. It also provides them with a vehicle through which to communicate a new narrative to the general public, and gives young people a voice in what Britain needs to do in the future.Butcher, M (2009). \\"A Tale of Two Countries\\", page 1 On their return all Fellows automatically become part of the Prime Minister's Global Fellowship Alumni, a network of active globally minded young people in England tasked with sharing their experiences and learning from the Fellowship experience on local and national platforms, to raise awareness of global issues.British Council website \\"What is the Prime Minister's Global Fellowship?\\" accessed November 10, 2009.

It is a theory-free method that looks at history through the accumulation of facts without major generalization and with consideration of the consequences of making causal claims. Epilogism is an inference which moves entirely within the domain of visible and evident things, it tries not to invoke unobservables. It is tightly knit to the famous \\"tripos of medicine\\".  Concept  There are conflicting accounts as to who introduced epilogism. It has been, for instance, attributed to Menodotus of Nicomedia as well as to Heracleides of Tarentum, who was also a follower of Epicureanism. It is also said that the empiricists were said to have devised epilogism (epilogismos) in order to distinguish their kind of reasoning from the type used by the rationalists, which required an understanding of the underlying nature of things, including the link between consequence and exclusion drawn between states of affairs. It is said that epilogism was the considered the most extreme form of reasoning acceptable to the empiricists. For the empiricists, epilogism was reasoning that focused on a temporarily hidden subject. It covered the ground addressed by the commemorative sign and featured the ordinary reasoning common to all human beings. It also had an exclusive focus on the phenomena and simply reported (without endorsing) the practice of the empirical doctor. As a medical method, it was used to infer the existence of something that is temporarily unclear, but in principle observable. See also Doctrines of the Empiric school. See also Causal inference. Epilogism in popular culture Epilogism is discussed as a way of viewing history in The Black Swan (Taleb book) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

This group became formally organized and instituted corporate memberships. The Employers' Advisory Group had several more names and for a very short period, was a chapter of a national group. The chapter hosted the national organization meeting in Chicago in 1921 for 2,000 people. In fact, on the first day of the event, the wait staff at the conference hotel went on strike. Bag or box lunches were obtained and lunch was eaten at the delegates' seats in an auditorium. The organization then became known as the Industrial Relations Association of Chicago and kept that name until 1982 when it became known as the Human Resources Management Association of Chicago. HRMAC is Chicagoland's premier resource for advancing workplace strategy and leadership. HRMAC membership consists of 500 Chicago area organizations with a network of over 5,000 HR Professionals representing small private companies to multi-national public corporations from every business sector. With an unmatched tradition of fellowship, education, and leadership, HRMAC is the oldest human resources organization in the country. Having recently concluded its 100th-anniversary celebration, HRMAC remains committed to serving the human resources community and advancing the impact of progressive HR strategies on business success. Mission and Vision  Mission  The Human Resources Management Association of Chicago serves the specialized and ever-changing needs of any HR professional within the Chicago area by being a provider of best practice resources, real-life applications and a connector to HR peers and industry leaders.  Vision  An open and vibrant Chicagoland community of professionals who are passionate about talent, building the best organizations of the future. Organization Time Line 1915: Fred V. Cann, of the training staff of Lakeside Press, invited several men from Chicago institutions to meet with him for the following purposes: acquaintance; mutual benefits; to assist in the proper placement and adjustment of those entering industries from the schools; exchange of young employees, rather than discharge of those not properly placed; study of employment records, test and job analysis; and close cooperation of the schools and the industries.\\" This meeting led to the formation of the Employment Advisors Club of Chicago. Though there appeared to have been one other such group in the country in Boston, it was affiliated with the local Chamber of Commerce and had individual memberships, rather than corporate. Thus, the Chicago group could have a claim to being the first human resources organization for corporate members in the United States. The Employment Advisors Club of Chicago held its first formal meeting on November 1, 1915, at the City Club. The speaker was Dr. H. D. Kitson of the University of Chicago, on the subject of \\"Psychological Tests in Employment.\\" The meeting was covered in the next morning's Chicago Tribune in the article, \\"Bump Your Head If You Want Job; Feeling ‚ÄòEm Now.\\"Chicago Tribune, September 9, 1915, \\"Bump Your Head if You Want Job; Feeling 'em Now\\", p. 9 The title is cryptic and today, but the writer's opinion couldn't be clearer on the \\"psychologists and character experts who say they are able to tell whether a man is fitted to become a cook or a carpenter by a look at his nose or a measurement of his head.\\" Mr. E.E. Sheldon, one of the Club's founders, later related, \\"My telephone began ringing and continued to ring‚Ä¶.I had to take myself down to the Tribune and find the reporter who had inserted that article‚Ä¶. Although no great harm came, we did get a good deal of advertising from that half-page in the Tribune.\\" 1916: the Employment Advisor's Club Ways and Means Committee set dues at $25.00 for company membership and $10.00 for placement agencies and civic memberships. 1919: In March a letter from the U. S. Department of Labor to Mr. Samuel T. Loftus officially chartered the \\"Employment Managers Association of Chicago.\\" The word of the charter was excitedly communicated to the members back in Chicago, and the organization became \\"The Chicago Council of the National Association of Employment Managers (NAEM).\\" The NAEM, founded in 1918, was one of the first organizations in the country to focus on corporate training and personnel issues, and Chicago was one of the first cities in the country to join in the formation of the national association. The first national conference was held in Cleveland in 1919. 1920: The National Association of Employment Managers became the Industrial Relations Association of America, and Chicago NAEM becomes the Industrial Relations Association of Chicago (IRAC.) In May, IRAC hosted the second annual national convention of the Industrial Relations Association. The three-day event drew more than 2,000 people from the United States and Canada. Cyrus McCormick, Jr., President of International Harvester, gave the opening address. Topics included \\"Radicalism,\\" \\"Americanization,\\" \\"How Many Hours per Day,\\" \\"Shortage of Labor,\\" and \\"Financial and Non-Financial Incentives.\\" 1921: Chicago becomes the largest of the 36 affiliated chapters of the Industrial Relations Association of America. 1930s: In 1934 IRAC holds the 1st annual Midwest Conference on Industrial Relations. Throughout the thirties, IRAC continues to present information sessions for members and convene special committees on topics of interest. One topic of discussion was vacation pay. \\"Constant pressure from the employee representatives for the further extension of vacations with pay is in evidence in the records of these joint bodies. The former limitations to certain groups have been largely removed. The trend is in the direction of vacations with pay for all groups of employees.\\"Report by the Committee on Group Relations of IRAC, 1931 By 1938, the group's membership stands at 83. 1940: IRAC celebrates its 25th anniversary with a gala dinner and meeting at the Palmer House. The celebration opened with the entire group singing ‚ÄòHappy Birthday, dear Association‚Äô as an enormous birthday cake with lighted candles was wheeled into the room and up to the speakers table‚Ä¶.From the Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Dinner and Annual Meeting and Election of the Industrial Relations Association of Chicago 1943: IRAC and the University of Chicago School of Business hosted the 10th Annual Midwest Conference on Industrial Relations.Chicago Sun-Times, September 17, 1943, \\"Experts Warn of Peril Facing Postwar Labor\\") The theme was \\"Labor for the Duration: A Duration that will be Longer than the War.\\" The afternoon was devoted to roundtables on subjects including: \\"Recent War Labor Board Directives,\\" \\"Pension and Profit Sharing Plans Under Recent Governmental Regulations,\\" \\"Wage Incentives,\\" \\"Effective Utilization of Essential Manpower,\\" and \\"Employee Morale.\\" 1945: IRAC pitched in to do its part for veterans of World War II. The President of IRAC documents this in a letter to Mr. G.L. Bergen, Personnel Manager at Marshall Field and Company: You are aware of the commitment we have with the Air Services Placement Center. In a recent conference with Commander Lyon of that group he advised me that they are now ready to start operating at capacity. Member companies provided personnel to give a day a month at the office of the Air Services Placement Center, working with separating fliers from the Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. IRAC members gave counseling and career guidance to the servicemen and linked them with job openings. 1950s: In 1950 IRAC membership was over 200. The Personnel Journal,\\" September 1950, featured an article about IRAC by Theron Wright, President, Chicago Industrial Relations Association and Personnel Officer, Chicago Title and Trust Co. In referring to IRAC, the article states that \\"Chicago is the home of one of the oldest and most active of the many local personnel associations in the country and Canada.\\" Throughout the 1950s, IRAC continued to expand its membership and present speakers of national prominence, including Robert F. Kennedy (Dec. ‚Äô58), then chief counsel for the Senate labor rackets committee. In November 1959, and Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell drew 430 to a meeting in Chicago's Prudential Building. 1965: IRAC celebrates its 50th anniversary. As noted in the Annual Report of 1965, The final meeting, our Annual Meeting, being the Golden Anniversary of the Industrial Relations Association of Chicago, was held on May 19, 1965, in the Grand Ballroom of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. Also in 1965, Dr. Robert R. Blake presented to IRAC on his new management model, \\"The Managerial Grid\\" which became one of the most famous models of management style and a cornerstone of organizational psychology for years to come. 1970s: IRAC continues to grow and hold educational meetings for its members. In the Fall Conference, themed \\"The Strategic New Role of Human Resource Management,\\" drew an attendance of 350 members. Jane Byrne, Mayor of Chicago at the time, gave the keynote speech, \\"Building a Better Business Climate\\". 1982: IRAC adopts its current name, \\"Human Resources Management Association of Chicago\\" (HRMAC). 2005: HRMAC celetrates its 90th anniversary with a special program \\"Celebrating Yesterday, Shaping Tomorrow\\" at the Chicago Cultural Center.

In January 2016, the organization merged with the American College of Cardiology. The Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care focuses on transforming cardiovascular care by assisting facilities in their effort to create communities of excellence that bring together quality, cost and patient satisfaction. As the only cross-specialty organization, SCPC provides the support needed for individual hospitals and hospital systems to effectively bridge existing gaps in treatment by providing the tools, education and support necessary to successfully navigate the changing face of healthcare. It is headquartered in Dublin, Ohio. Through disease management and accreditation processes, SCPC is \\"Taking Science to the Bedside.‚Äù History The concept of creating a chest pain center (CPC) in every hospital was presented in the late 1980s as a strategy to significantly reduce heart attack deaths through the rapid treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction. In 1981, the first CPC was started in the emergency department at St. Agnes HealthCare Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. This area of the emergency department was originally called the Chest Pain Emergency Room and later changed to Chest Pain Centers in Emergency Departments. By 1988, St. Agnes was able to track the creation of more than 2000 Chest Pain Centers in Emergency Departments throughout the United States. In 1993, the First Congress of Chest Pain Centers was held in Savannah, Georgia. In February 1997, Reader's Digest publishes the article, He Declared War on Heart Attacks on Early Heart Attack Care as championed by Dr. Raymond Bahr, a cardiologist at St. Agnes, in order to prevent untimely deaths by heart attacks. In 1998, The Society of Chest Pain Centers was created as a new medical society in order to further develop CPCs and the mission was to reduce heart attack deaths by placing emphasis on Early Heart Attack Care (EHAC). In 2000, the growth of the CPC was almost halted when the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) created a new policy that observation services in the emergency department were not going to be reimbursed. The Society of Chest Pain Centers and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) met with the HCFA in order to petition to have this rule overturned and, in 2001, they were successful. After the ruling was reversed, HCFA administrators requested additional information in order to discern ‚ÄúAccredited‚Äù facilities from those that used this phrase as a marketing term. Implementation of Accreditation Process In 2001, the Society of Chest Pain Centers established an accreditation committee to set up an Accreditation Process of Improvement for Hospitals with Chest Pain Centers. The Accreditation Process was based on the ‚ÄúEight Key Elements of a Chest Pain Center‚Äù previously published in the American Journal of Cardiology. ;The Eight Key Elements include: * Community Education and Early Heart Attack Care * Emergency Department Integration with the EMS * Emergency Assessment of Patients with Symptoms of ACS ‚Äì Timely Diagnosis and Treatment of ACS * Assessment of Patients with Low Risk for ACS and No Assignable Cause for Their Symptoms * Process Improvement * Personnel, Competencies and Training * Organizational Structure and Commitment * Functional Facility Design After a hospital becomes accredited, the process cycle for improvement must be documented every three years in order to maintain active accreditation status. The Society of Chest Pain Centers process improvement accreditation and certification programs include: * Chest Pain Center Accreditation * Heart Failure Accreditation * Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Accreditation * Certified Chest Pain Coordinator Program As of March 18, 2015, the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care has granted 1,026 Chest Pain Center, Atrial Fibrillation, or Heart Failure Accreditations. Early Heart Attack Care and Community Education In addition to accreditation and process improvement for hospitals, the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care utilizes outreach communication to inform the medical community and the community at large about Early Heart Attack Care (EHAC).Early Heart Attack Care (EHAC) Developed in 1985, this education is shared worldwide to help people recognize the early signs in order to prevent a heart attack from occurring in themselves or others. In the event of a heart attack, early detection can also prevent extensive damage to the affected heart muscle. Early Heart Attack Care education identifies the early symptoms of a heart attack so that people can receive medical care as soon as possible. Symptoms can include: * Mild chest pressure, squeezing or discomfort * Nausea * Pain that travels down one or both arms * Jaw pain * Fatigue * Anxiety * Back pain * Shortness of breath * Feeling of fullness The EHAC initiative originally started in 1985 at St. Agnes Hospital. As part of this initiative to educate the medical community and the community at large, the initiative includes a web-based tool called Deputy Heart Attack. Deputy Heart Attack provides an educational course on spotting a heart attack and providing the timely medical care.Deputy Heart Attack After the course and a small test, a person who successfully passes the course becomes ‚ÄúDeputized‚Äù in EHAC. [Link] As part of the deputizing process, the user must adhere to the EHAC Oath, ‚ÄúI understand that heart attacks have beginnings and, on occasion, signs of an impending heart attack may include chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shoulder and/or arm pain, and weakness. These may occur hours or weeks before the actual heart attack. I solemnly swear that if it happens to me or anyone I know, I will call 9-1-1 or activate our Emergency Medical Services.‚Äù In May 2012, SCPC expands educational resources to the public at large by releasing BestHeartHospital App for Apple and Android platforms that can be downloaded directly to a phone, tablet or computer.BestHeartHospital App This app allows patients to view accredited facilities in their area. As of June 27, 2012, 4998 people have taken the EHAC Oath. As of February 22, 2015, 375,323 people have taken the EHAC Oath.

The show was based on the original American series of the same title and was hosted by Tony Johnston. This version was the only one to use children as contestants, and in turn used points instead of dollars due to a law in Australia and Europe which prohibits children from winning money on game shows. After the show was cancelled, it reran until 2004. Format First two rounds The game was played with two boards (with twelve correct answers and four Wipeouts in each). The correct answers were indicated by checkmarks and the Wipeouts were indicated by crosses. In the beginning, the crosses appeared after an explosion; later they appear in a variety of ways. Correct answers were worth 25 points each in board one and 50 points each in board two. Also, after an answer, play immediately went to the next contestant. In addition, the \\"Hot Spot\\" was simply called the \\"Bonus\\" but otherwise acted the same. The lowest scoring contestant is eliminated at the end of the round. If the round ended in a tie, the tied contestants were then shown a tiebreaker board with 12 answers arranged in a frame. Eight were right, and four were wrong. The tied contestants (starting with the player who won the coin toss) went back and forth picking answers until one contestant wiped out. The first contestant to wipe out was eliminated from the game, and the other player advanced to the next round. Third round (Bid for the Grid) In Bid for the Grid, there were twelve answers on the board. In early episodes, eight were right, and four were wrong. In later episodes, the number of correct answers and Wipeouts was split evenly with six apiece. Contestants secretly lock in their bids following five seconds of thinking time; the higher bid (or, in case of a tie, the faster entry) plays. Once the player won the bidding, he/she must give that number of answers in a row without a Wipeout. If the contestant can complete the contract, he/she won the board; but if the contestant wiped out, the opposing player must give just one correct answer to win the board. If the stealing player wiped out, play went back to the original player still trying to complete to contract and win the board. The first player to win two out of three boards wins the game and the right to play the bonus round. Bonus round (Win it in a Minute) In the bonus round, the contestant must select a category (from two given) to play. They then had 60 seconds to find six correct answers on a grid of twelve possible answers. The contestant must enter his/her guesses on an oversized keypad and then run to the buzzer located near the display to check his/her performance. The contestant was allowed to turn on more than six answers but if they did, a computerized voice would repeatedly say, \\"Too many, too many!\\" and the buzzer would not respond if they hit it. Winning the bonus round won him/her a major prize, which changed on occasion.

It works to: * encourage greater public interest in and awareness of the stone built heritage of England :Category:Buildings and structures in England and the threats it faces; * encourage the use of English stone for the public benefit and to; * ensure the availability of the stone required for the maintenance of the built heritage and new build.

There is a similar organisation for Welsh stone. History From 1990 it had become increasingly apparent that difficulties in obtaining authentic stone were seriously hampering the repair and conservation of historic and listed buildings in the UK. This situation had come about because of a number of factors including: *the decline of the UK dimension stone industry and the closing of many quarries; *the development of elaborate environmental protection legislation and the lack of building conservation legislation of equal strength; *a planning system which penalised small scale quarrying; *lack of understanding of the technical importance Identifying and Sourcing Stone for Historic Building Repair.

Edinburgh: Historic Scotland. of specifying the original stone for repairs; *the loss of old quarries to brown field development for landfill, factories and houses or as country parks and nature reserves *public misunderstanding of the small scale of dimension stone quarrying compared with aggregate production *lack of knowledge about the The English Heritage Strategic Stone study historical sources of building stone The consequence was that dimension stone quarrying became increasingly uneconomical and unpalatable especially for small scale operators. In response to this situation and with the support of English Heritage, the Deputy Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (now the Department of Communities and Local Government Department for Communities and Local Government) Department of Communities and Local Government commissioned a report Planning for the Supply of Natural Building and Roofing Stone in England and Wales (known as The Symonds Report). Published in 2004 it reviewed the state of supply and demand for building stone and the planning environment in which it operated. It recommended: *revisions to minerals planning policy *designations of heritage quarries *creation of a national database of building and roofing stones including their **Description **Suitability **Existing sources **Extent of unworked resources **Constraints on production and **Importance A summary of the report Planning for the supply of building and roofing stone is available from Communities and Local Government Publications.

National policy is the responsibility of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) while local policies and decisions on planning applications rest with local minerals planning authorities. The main threads of national policy are that: *Historic buildings should be repaired and conserved by using stone which is technically compatible with the original stone used in the building. In practical terms, this will normally mean a stone from the same or a similar, nearby source. It is well established that incompatible stones with, for example, a different porosity to the original stone can lead to the latter‚Äôs rapid deterioration as well as detracting from the building's appearance and beauty. *Stones traditionally used in an area should be used, where appropriate, for new buildings in conservation areas. *Sources of important stone should be safeguarded from development which would make them unavailable. Safeguarding became government policy in 2006 under the Mineral Policy Statement 1 (MPS1), Annex 3 Natural building and roofing stone and the associated Practice guide (building and roofing stones). DCLG Minerals Policy Statement *Stone can only be produced from where it occurs in the ground. This inevitably leads to difficulties where there are other interests or designations such as environmental protection, scientific interest or amenity value in the same place. ESF supports the view that a balanced approach should be taken to proposals to extract an historic stone. This should be based on the relative significance of the stone and the environmental, scientific or amenity value of the site. To this end it supports the development of a ranking system for the importance of stone based on the scale, time and geographical extent of its historic use, the importance of the buildings it has been used in and its special technical features. Intrinsic value of building stones This system would result in designations of nationally, regionally and locally important stones (as recommended in the report prepared by Symonds). The designation should then be compared with the relative importance of other interests in the site. ESF is also supporting and contributing views to a scheme for the designation of Global Heritage Building Stones which is being developed by the International Association of Engineering Geology and the Environment. International Association for Engineering Geologists IAEG *The English Stone Forum considers that it is illogical and impractical to require a proposal to extract stone to demonstrate that similar stone could not be produced from some other place somewhere in the UK. This would constitute proving a negative.

Its initial ecclesiastical jurisdiction encompassed Indiana as well as the eastern third of Illinois. In 1843 the Diocese of Chicago was erected from the Illinois portion of the diocese, and in 1857 Diocese of Fort Wayne was erected from the northern half of Indiana. The seat of the episcopal see was transferred from Vincennes, Indiana, to Indianapolis, and on 28 March 1898 it became the Diocese of Indianapolis. Pope Pius XII elevated the Indianapolis diocese to an archdiocese in 1944, and erected two new Indiana dioceses: the Diocese of Evansville and the Diocese of Lafayette. The Diocese of Gary, Indiana, was erected in 1956. The Evansville Diocese absorbed the city of Vincennes upon its creation.

Joseph Chartrand, successor to Bishop Chatard, was named coadjutor bishop of Indianapolis on 27 June 1910. See Kennedy, p. 27 and 39. The first four Bishops of Vincennes resided at the seat of the episcopal diocese in Vincennes. Their remains are buried in the crypt of St. Francis Xavier Basilica, Vincennes. Bishop Chatard, who resided in Indianapolis and also served as Bishop of Indianapolis, was interred at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Indianapolis; his remains were moved to Calvary Cemetery, Indianapolis, in 1976.Diocesan Centennial: Diocese of Indianapolis, Vincennes, 1834-1934, p. 22.Divita, p. 56.  History  Early mission (1675-1834) Before the Diocese of Vincennes was erected in 1834 its territory passed through three ecclesiastical jurisdictions: the Diocese of Quebec, Canada, until 1789; the Diocese of Baltimore, Maryland, 1789 to 1808; and the Diocese of Bardstown, Kentucky, 1808 to 1834.Alerding and Chatard, p. 29, 50-60, and 81-83.Godecker, p. 162-64. It is believed that the first French Jesuit missionaries came to the area that included the site of present-day Vincennes, Indiana, in the late 17th century, around 1675. In these early years, the Diocese of Quebec supported the Catholic mission churches in the area. Father Mermet, who may have been the first priest at the site that became known as Vincennes, arrived around 1712, but it is not known how long he stayed.Alerding and Chatard, p. 50. The earliest Catholic Church at Vincennes was established around 1732, and became known as St. Francis Xavier. It served as the cathedral for the Diocese of Vincennes from 1834 to 1898. Father Sebastian Louis Meurin, St. Francis Xavier's first resident priest, arrived in May 1748, but the earliest records of the Catholic Church in Vincennes, Indiana date to 21 April 1749.Kennedy, p. 7 After Father Meurin's departure from Vincennes in 1753, several itinerant priests visited the Catholic parish, including Father Pierre Gibault, who visited the area in 1770. Father Gibault served as the resident priest at St. Francis Xavier from 1785 to 1789.Alerding and Chatard, p. 57 and 61-63. During this early period, the Catholic communities in the area experienced hardships during the American Revolution, conflicts with Native Americans, and suffered from epidemics that swept through the frontier. The Diocese of Quebec served Catholic parishes across North America, but it lacked money and sufficient priests.Kennedy, p. 8. On 6 November 1789, when Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Baltimore as the first Catholic diocese in the United States,Godecker, pp. 162-64. Vincennes and the Catholic missions in what became present-day Indiana were placed under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the new diocese. John Carroll was appointed the first Bishop of Baltimore, and in 1791 he sent Fr. Benedict Joseph Flaget to succeed Fr. Gibault at the fledgling St. Francis Xavier parish in Vincennes.Kennedy, p. 9. Father Flaget arrived at Vincennes on 21 December 1792. Before he was recalled to Baltimore in 1795, Father Flaget opened a school and held classes at St. Francis Xavier church. The school's curriculum included religious studies, music, and vocational training.Godecker, pp. 166-67, and 174. John Francis Rivet, Father Flaget's successor, arrived at Vincennes in 1796 to continue Flaget's work and died there in 1804. Father Rivet, who received a $200 annual salary from the U.S. Congress, became the first public school teacher in the Northwest Territory.Shake, p. 20. In 1808 Pope Pius VII divided the Catholic churches in the United States and its territories into five dioceses. The Catholic parishes in the northwest territories, which included the Indiana Territory, became part of the Diocese of Bardstown, with Fr. Flaget appointed as its first bishop. In 1814 he became the first Catholic bishop to visit Indiana.Alerding and Chatard, p. 29 and 81-83. In 1832 Bishop Flaget and Bishop Joseph Rosati, the first bishop of the Diocese of St. Louis, Missouri, petitioned the Holy See to name Simon Brut√© de R√©mur as the first Bishop of Vincennes.Alerding and Chatard, p. 94. Diocese under Bishop Brut√© (1834-1839) On 6 May 1834 Pope Gregory XVI issued a Papal Bull to erect the Diocese of Vincennes, the first episcopal see in Indiana.Alerding and Chatard, p. 29. Fr. Simon Brut√© de R√©mur was consecrated as the first Bishop of Vincennes on 28 October 1834 at St. Louis, and arrived at Vincennes on 5 November 1834.Godecker, p. 220. At the time of his installation, there were only three priests in his diocese which covered all of Indiana and the eastern third of Illinois.Kennedy, pp. 12-15. Bishop Brut√© made a point to visit each Catholic family in his diocese, regardless of the distance from his rectory at Vincennes. He also founded a college at Vincennes in 1837, and connected it to a theological seminary for men to train for the priesthood that had been established under the Eudists. In 1839 they purchased a building on the site of the first Vincennes University, which failed, and named the new school St. Gabriel's College. The college closed in 1845, but its building was home to St. Rose Academy until it moved to a new location in 1884.Shake, p. 22. Bishop Brut√©'s devotion to the diocese contributed to his demise. He became ill while attending a provincial council in Baltimore, Maryland. The illness weakened his immune system, but he continued his duties until his death at Vincennes on 26 June 1839.Godecker, p. 390 and 403.Kennedy, p. 17. His remains are buried in the St. Francis Xavier crypt at Vincennes.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 159-60. Diocese under Bishop Hailandi√®re (1839-1847) Father C√©lestine Guynemer de la Hailandi√®re, Bishop Brut√©'s vicar general, was consecrated as the second Bishop of Vincennes on 18 August 1839 at the Chapel of Sacred Heart in Paris, France.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 166-67. The new bishop remained in France for several months to raise funds and make arrangements for improvements to the diocese. Among his most significant achievements were completing St. Francis Xavier Cathedral at Vincennes, and construction of a library to house Bishop Brut√©'s collection of more than 5,000 books and religious documents. He consecrated the cathedral on 8 August 1841.Alerding and Chatard, p. 170. The diocese quickly expanded its services under Bishop Hailandi√®re's direction. He arranged for the Sisters of Providence to establish their order within the diocese, and encouraged the Brothers of the Holy Cross to establish schools for boys. He also called on Catholic leaders, including Father Edward Sorin, founder of the University of Notre Dame, and Mother Th√©odore Gu√©rin, founder of Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, to join him in Indiana.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 170-71. Despite Bishop de Hailandi√®re' efforts in Indiana, its population grew slowly and the institutions that he helped to establish suffered many problems. He became discouraged and resigned in 1847.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 176-77.Kennedy, p. 21. Bishop Hailandi√®re returned to France, where he died on 1 May 1882.Diocesan Centennial: Diocese of Indianapolis, Vincennes, 1834-1934, p. 18. His remains are buried in the crypt at St. Francis Xavier in Vincennes.Alerding and Chatard, p. 225. Diocese under Bishop Bazin (1847-1849) John Stephen Bazin, Bishop Hailandi√®re's successor, was appointed the third Bishop of Vincennes on 3 September 1847. He was the first bishop ordained in Indiana. Bishop Bazin's consecration took place at St. Francis Xavier Cathedral in Vincennes on 24 October 1847.Alerding and Chatard, p. 187. Ill health shortened his service to the diocese. Within a few months of his consecration, Bishop Bazin appointed Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, his vicar general, as administrator to the diocese. Bishop Bazin died at Vincennes on 23 April 1848, after having served about six months.  Diocese under Bishop St. Palais (1849-1878) Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, Bishop Bazin's successor, was consecrated as the fourth Bishop of Vincennes on 14 January 1849 at Vincennes.Alerding and Chatard, p. 195. During his tenure as bishop, he had to contend with unresolved monetary issues from Hailandi√®re's episcopacy, a cholera epidemic, the American Civil War, and expanding the educational and ministerial opportunities within the diocese. In 1849 Mother Theodore Guerin established St. Ann's orphanage in Vincennes, and in 1853 monks from Einsiedeln, Switzerland, founded St. Meinrad abbey and seminary in southern Indiana, but plans to open a school for Negroes was never carried out.Kennedy, pp. 27-30 and 73.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 196-97. During the American Civil War several priests from the diocese served as chaplains, and one priest, Fr. Ernest Audran, was drafted as a soldier in 1864.Kennedy, p. 32. After the war Bishop St. Palais recognized that Indianapolis had become a quickly-growing city, the eighth largest in the United States as of 1870, but deferred the decision to move the seat of the diocese to his successor.Kennedy, p. 35. Bishop St. Palais died on 28 June 1877. At the time of his death, the diocese had grown to include 151 churches, 117 priests, and 90,000 parishioners. His remains are buried in the crypt of St. Francis Xavier Basilica at Vincennes.Alerding and Chatard, p. 195 and 207-09. Diocese under Bishop Chatard (1878-1898) Fr. Francis Silas Chatard, Indiana‚Äôs first American-born bishop, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes in Rome, Italy, on 12 May 1878.Kennedy, p. 37. He established his residence at Indianapolis in 1878, and in 1898 Pope Leo XII approved Bishop Chatard's request to transfer the episcopal see to Indianapolis.Divita, p. 5.Alerding and Chatard, p. 217. The Diocese of Vincennes became the Diocese of Indianapolis on 28 March 1898, and Bishop Chatard became the first Bishop of Indianapolis. He died at Indianapolis on 7 September 1918, and was interred at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. His remains were later moved to Calvary Cemetery, Indianapolis. St. John the Evangelist Church, Indianapolis, served as the pro-cathedral of the Diocese of Indianapolis until Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was completed in 1907.Kennedy, p. 90.Divita, p. 37.  Change from residential to titular see  During the 19th century the Diocese of Vincennes was divided and two suffragan sees were erected in Indiana and Illinois. In 1843 the Illinois portion of the diocese became the Diocese of Chicago. On 8 January 1857 the northern half of Indiana comprised the Diocese of Fort Wayne.Alerding and Chatard, p. 206. On 28 March 1898 the episcopal diocese was transferred from Vincennes to Indianapolis, and the Diocese of Vincennes became the Diocese of Indianapolis. In 1944 Pope Pius XII elevated the Indianapolis diocese to an archdiocese and founded two new Indiana dioceses: the Diocese of Evansville and the Diocese of Lafayette. The city of Vincennes, the former seat of the Diocese of Vincennes, became part of the newly created Roman Catholic Diocese of Evansville, which ended its connection to the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.http://www.evansville-diocese.org/history.htm The Diocese of Gary was erected on 17 December 1956. In 1995 the former diocese was restored as the titular episcopal see of Vincennes, and in 1997 Bishop Gerald Eugene Wilkerson was appointed as its first titular bishop.

Included are, first, rulers on an island-wide level, and, second, rajas of minor states that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The following list is based on epigraphic records, Balinese chronicles (babad), and data supplied by Dutch colonial sources. Balinese monarch lineages and monarchy claims continue to exist in Bali, however, due to Indonesian occupation, the rise of the original rulers of Bali have been suppressed. Hinduism has remained an integral part of the Balinese monarchies and culture, despite initial persecutions committed by Indonesian central authorities and military.

Consisting of 20 lines, the oath is an invocation of all supernatural powers, deities (hyang) from heavens and earth to protect and support the king's mandate. Whoever breaks the law would be punished by these supernatural beings, die in horrible way such as their brain being sucked, blood being drunk, disembowelment, and chest is split in two.

When Julius Caesar entered the part of Gaul that was still independent of Roman rule in 58 BC, a number of Belgic polities formed a defensive alliance and acclaimed Galba commander-in- chief.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 2.4; John Creighton, Coins and Power in Late Iron Age Britain (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 12 online. Caesar recognizes Galba for his sense of justice (iustitia) and intelligence (prudentia).Justitiam prudentiamque (Bellum Gallicum 2.4.7): \\"a just and able man,\\" in the translation of S.A. Handford, Caesar: The Conquest of Gaul (Penguin Books, 1951, revised ed. 1982), p. 59. Prudentia combines the capacities of \\"foresight\\" and \\"practical wisdom\\" (OLD). In the usage of Cicero, contemporary with that of Caesar, prudentia is the Latin equivalent of Greek phronesis. Etymology of name Galba as a Roman cognomen is associated with a branch of the gens Sulpicia. Although the most famous bearer is the Emperor Galba in the 1st century AD, a Servius Sulpicius Galba also served under Caesar in Gaul.Bellum Gallicum 3.1‚Äì6 and 7.90.

What is hydraulic surge Hydraulic surges are created when the velocity of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluid's velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated within a matter of seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded surge relief valve, spring-loaded pressure safety valves, pilot-operated valves, surge suppressors, and rupture disks. Typical applications Surge control products have been used in many industries to protect the maximum working pressure of hydraulic system for decades. Typical applications for surge relief equipment is in pipelines at pump stations, receiving manifolds at storage facilities, back pressure control, marine loading/off loading, site specific applications where pressure surges are generated by the automation system, or any location deemed critical by an engineering firm performing a surge analysis. Surge suppressors Surge suppressors perform surge relief by acting as a pulsation dampener. Most suppressors have a metal tank with an internal elastic bladder in it. Within the tank they pressurize the top of the bladder with a compressed gas while the product comes in the bottom of the pressure vessel. The gas in the bladder is supplying the system with its set point. During normal operation, as the process conditions begins to build pressure; the internal bladder contracts from the pressure gain allowing liquid to move into the surge suppressor pressure vessel adding volume to the location. This increase in physical volume prevents the pressure from rising to dangerous levels. Advantages: * Very fast speed of response. * Zero loss of product from the pipeline from a surge event. * Can be used as both a surge suppressor and for surge relief. Disadvantages: * Limited capacity of volume for surge relief. * The surge suppressor must be as physically close as possible to the area where the surge is generated. Surge Suppressors can become very large depending on line size. * Has a limited maximum working pressure. Rupture discs A rupture disc, also known as a burst disc, bursting disc, or burst diaphragm, is a onetime use, non-reclosing pressure relief device that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from over pressurization or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A rupture disc is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost- effective, but can become time-consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out. Advantages: * Isolates equipment from the process conditions, protecting the equipment until it is needed for a surge relief event. * Cost effective installation. * Very fast response time. Disadvantages: * One time use. * Requires down time to replace. * A rupture disk has only one set point. * Uncontrollable release of large amounts of harmful substances. Spring- loaded pressure safety valves Spring-loaded pressure safety valves use a compressed spring to hold the valve closed. The valve will remain closed until the process pressure exceeds the set point of the spring pressure. The valve will open 100% when the set point is reached and will remain open until a certain blow down factor is reached. Oftentimes the blow down is a percentage of the set point, such as 20% of the set point. That means that the valve will remain open until the process pressure decreases to 20% below the set point of the spring-loaded relief valve. Advantages: * Opens 100% when set point is reached. * Easy to install and maintain. * High flow capacity or Cv value in gas service. Disadvantages: * Has a blow down factor inherent to the design of the valve. * The spring takes a set, making the set point drift over time. * May release product to atmosphere. Surge relief valves Surge relief valves are known for their quick speed of response, excellent flow characteristics, and durability in high pressure applications. Surge relief valves are designed to have an adjustable set point that is directly related to the max pressure of the pipeline/system. When the product on the inlet of the valve exceeds the set point it forces the valve to open and allows the excess surge to be bled out in to a breakout tank or recirculated into a different pipeline. So in the event of the surge, the majority of the pressure is absorbed in the liquid and pipe, and just that quantity of liquid which is necessary to relieve pressures of unsafe proportions is discharged to the surge relief tank. Some valve manufactures use the piston style with a nitrogen control system and external plenums, while others use elastomeric tubes, external pilots, or internal chambers. Pilot operated valves Pilot operated surge relief valves are typically used to protect pipelines that move low viscosity products like gasoline or diesel. This style of valve is installed downstream of the pump/valve that creates the surge. The valve is controlled by an external, normally closed pilot valve. The pilot will be set to the desired set point of the system, with a sense line that runs up stream of the valve. When the upstream process conditions start to exceed the pilot set point, the valve begins to open and relieve the excess pressure until the correct pressure is met causing the valve to close. Advantages: * Does not require power. * Adjustable set point. * High flow capacity or Cv value Disadvantages: * Slower speed of response. * Cannot be used in high viscosity applications. * Pilot is sensitive to any type of particulate in the control loop. Gas loaded surge relief valves Piston-style gas-loaded surge relief valves operate on the balanced piston design and can be used in a variety of applications because it can handle high and low viscosity products while maintaining a fast speed of response. An inert gas, most commonly nitrogen, is loaded on the back side of the piston forcing the valve closed. The nitrogen pressure on the back side of the piston is actually what determines the valves set point. These valves will remain closed until the inlet pressure exceeds the set point/nitrogen pressure, at which time the valve will open from the high pressure and remain open as long as the process pressure is above the nitrogen pressure. Once the process pressure starts to decay, the valve will start to close. Once the process pressure is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve will go closed again. Advantages: * Fast speed of response with soft closure to prevent generating a second surge event. * Can be used on high viscosity products such as crude oil. * Good flow characteristics (Cv) * No blowdown, reseats at the set point. Disadvantages: * Only as repeatable as the system controlling the nitrogen pressure. * Performance is greatly impacted by any restrictions in the gas line between the relief valve and the plenum tank. * Many manufacturers recommend burring the plenum for temperature stability. Rubber boot-style gas-loaded relief valve Rubber boot-style gas-loaded relief valves operate by using nitrogen pressure loaded on the outside diameter of a rubber boot that is covering the flow path through the relief valve. As long as the process pressure is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve is closed. As soon as the process pressure raises above the nitrogen pressure, the product in the line forces the rubber boot away from the barrier and allows product to pass through the valve. When the process pressure decreases below the nitrogen pressure, the valve goes closed again. Advantages: * There are many types of rubber elastomers for many different types of products. * Fast speed of response when the rubber boot isn't cold. * Achieves positive seal even when there is minor particulate in the line. Disadvantages: * Rubber boot is greatly affected by temperature, the lower the temperature the less repeatable the relief valve set point. * Poor flow characteristics (Low Cv) require larger valves to achieve the desired flow rates. * Replacing the rubber boot requires the valve be removed from the line to be disassembled. * Current generation valves have metal internals and do not use older generation Rubber Boot. Controlling surge relief valves There are many different approaches to controlling surge relief equipment. It all starts with the technology used in the specific application. Spring-loaded pressure safety valves and pilot-operated valves are controlled mechanically using the pressure from a compressed spring. Typically there is an adjustment stem that allows for minor adjustments on the set point by compressing or decompressing the spring. This design is limited by the pressure that can be generated by the spring in the valve. Gas-loaded relief valves are controlled by the nitrogen pressure loaded into the relief valve. If there is no control on the nitrogen pressure, then the nitrogen gas will expand and contract with the changing ambient temperature. As the nitrogen pressure drifts with the temperature so does the set point of the relief valve. The nitrogen pressure has traditionally been controlled using mechanical regulators. Regulators are designed to operate under flowing conditions. When used in the closed end plenum system of a surge relief valve, it must also perform an on/off function to correct for thermal expansion and contraction. Being a pressure control device designed for use under flowing conditions, it is not well suited to perform the on/off function needed in a closed-end system such as a surge relief valve plenum. Another common issue is that regulators are required to operate outside of their design limits when making the corrections needed for thermal expansion and contraction. The volume of gas required to be added or vented from the system is so small that the regulator is required to operate below the minimum threshold of its performance curve. As a result, inconsistent corrections are made to the system pressure which impact the gas- loaded relief valve's set point. A highly accurate and reliable approach to controlling the nitrogen pressure on a gas-loaded surge relief valve is to use an electronic control system to add and vent nitrogen pressure from the gas- loaded surge relief valve. This technique assures the required set point accuracy and repeatability needed in this critical application.

History Henry Law, a teacher originally from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, emigrated to Harrison County in 1826 with his father and brother. Once settled he began his life as a farmer and raised cattle and sheep, as well as a multitude of crops. He met and married the former Elizabeth McMillan, also from Ireland. Soon after their 1839 wedding, the Laws moved into a log cabin farmhouse at the source of Plum Run in Monroe Township, and in 1846 they relocated to the present property with its substantially larger house. They were the parents of eleven children, all of whom survived into adulthood,Commemorative Biographical Record of the Counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio, Containing Biographical Sketches of Prominent and Representative Citizens, and of Many of the Early Settled Families. Chicago: Beers, 1891. and of whom the oldest was John Quincy Law. John inherited the farm when his father died in 1869, and expanded the house when he added a kitchen in the downstairs and a living room and two bedrooms in the upstairs. John married Ella Scott, who was the daughter of Brigadier General Josiah Noble Scott, a veteran of the War of 1812 and Rachel Vance Scott, who was a descendant of the Vans family from Dirleton Castle in Scotland and Laird Barnbarroch. The couple would raise six children. John Quincy followed in his fathers footsteps and became a teacher, and later a member of the school board. He also served on the Board of Directors at the Dennison National Bank. When John Quincy died in 1927 the property passed to his third child, Frank Vance Law, but he didn't take title until 1931. Frank resided at the home until his death in 1956, and the property passed into the possession of his sister Eliza Rachel Law (Lida) and his brother Jay Quincy. Lida died shortly thereafter in 1958, and Jay became the sole owner. Jay worked the land until his death in 1964, when he named his niece, Ella Virginia Reed Huss, as the heir of the Law Farm. Ella maintained the home and assisted in the formation of the Huss Farm Foundation in 2001, and also aided in the petition to place the farm on the National Register, which it did so in the same year as her death, in 2002. The entry also placed the Ernest and Lena Reed Farm, as well as of land on the register as well. The farm is still functional and raises crops as well as Shorthorn and Angus cattle.

Eleven percent of Ecuadorians (1.5 million people) live outside Ecuador, primarily in Spain and the United States. Between 400,000 and 500,000 Ecuadorians were estimated to live in the United States in 2003; nearly 500,000 were estimated to live in Spain in 2005. Ecuadorians have also settled in Italy, the Netherlands, France, and Canada. Ecuadorians living abroad remit $1.7 billion to family in Ecuador each year; an estimated one million Ecuadorians rely on these remittances for income. Only petroleum exports are a greater contribution to Ecuador's economy than remittances, which exceed banana exports and income from tourism in value.Mary J. Weismantel. \\"Ecuadorian international migration\\". In The Ecuador Reader (Carlos De La Torre and Steve Striffler, eds.). Duke University Press (2008). Ecuadorian nationals are residents in more than 60 countries. Early emigration from Ecuador was triggered by the collapse of Ecuador's Panama hat industry in the 1950s. Emigrants at this time often traveled to New York City, where many had connections with hat importers. In the United States, Ecuadorians are most concentrated in New York City and New Jersey; approximately 90,000 Ecuadorians live in Queens, particularly in Corona and Jackson Heights. Alternately, some Ecuadorians arrived with forged visas or on passports with legitimate visas but substituted photos. Ecuadorians typically paid for the journey by borrowing from usurious moneylenders and using their property in Ecuador as collateral. During the late 1990s financial crisis in Ecuador, a mass migration to Spain occurred. The number of Ecuadorians in Spain climbed from less than 10,000 in 1998 to 200,000 in 2002 to over 500,000 in 2005. This migration was initially led by women. Ecuadorians flew to Spain on tourist visas and stayed to look for work. Spain offered amnesty to undocumented migrants in 2004 and 2005; 140,000 Ecuadorians legalized their status. Nearly all Ecuadorians who emigrate intend to return to Ecuador, even though many have settled permanently.

His instrumental sound is characterized by a mix of Latin and North American guitar styles. Background Starting out on the piano and clarinet as a child, switching to folk guitar at age 12, and continuing as a largely self-taught blues and rock player, Rolland moved into formal training in jazz through summer programs and lessons at New England Conservatory and Berklee School of Music while attending Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school. His first live performance was at age 14 with a rock band at the Club Casablanca in Harvard Square. Youthful influences included frequenting the Club 47 and The Boston Tea Party in the later 1960s, and an appearance at the 1976 Montreux Jazz Festival backing jazz trumpeter Clark Terry in a big band setting. His father was an amateur piano and cornet player from Hannibal, Missouri who, as a teenager in the early 1940s, moonlighted playing jazz on Mississippi riverboats, before moving East with his mother after World War II to attend Harvard Medical School under the GI Bill. Rolland studied classical theory and composition with Douglas Leedy at Reed College, then completed a B.A. degree at the University of New Hampshire, where he studied under Mark DeVoto and graduated in 1977. He resumed recording with the release of a solo guitar album, Long Night's Moon (2000), followed by Dreams of Brazil (2002/2006), and The Tide's In (2007/2008).

Specifically, the court held that there is no requirement for a public prosecutor to have a subjective belief that an accused person is actually guilty. Nor can there be a presumption of malice from a lack of reasonable and probable grounds. Background Criminal proceedings In 1991, Matthew Miazga, a Crown prosecutor in Saskatchewan was asked to give pre-charge advice to police officers investigating a case of child abuse. Specifically, three siblings were making serious and bizarre claims of sexual abuse against their biological parents, their mother's boyfriend, their foster parents, Anita and Dale Klassen, and members of the Klassens' extended family. Eventually, the Klassens and their family were charged with approximately 70 counts of sexual assault. Miazga remained assigned as the trial prosecutor. During the course of the trial proceedings, Miazga came to have some concerns about the children's credibility. He consulted with his head office, who advised him to continue the prosecution if he believed the essential elements of the children's story. On December 18, 1992, the children's biological parents were found guilty of sexual assault against the children. The trial judge went on to urge that the children not be made to endure another criminal trial. As a result of the judge's comments, as well as Miazga's increasing concern about the children's credibility, he negotiated a plea bargain with one of the Klassen's extended family, and stayed the remaining charges. In 1995, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld the convictions against the biological parents. In 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed an appeal based on the problems with the children's evidence. Malicious prosecution trial Some years after the stay of proceedings, all three children recanted their allegations. Miazga, along with other members of the investigation, were sued by the Klassens and their extended family members (other than the individual who pleaded guilty) for malicious prosecution. In 2003, the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan found Miazga liable for malicious prosecution, criticizing his role in advising the police, his conduct during the criminal proceedings, and his failure to express any remorse and lack of concern about the effect the prosecution had. Specifically, the trial judge noted that Miazga never testified whether he believed the children, and even if did believe the children it would not have been reasonable. In addition, the lack of reasonable and probable grounds created a presumption that Miazga was acting maliciously. Malicious prosecution appeal In 2007, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal released a split decision regarding Miazga's appeal. All three judges agreed that the trial judge erred in finding that there were strong indications that Miazga was acting maliciously. Miazga had a more limited role than the police during the investigation, and Miazga immediately consented to the Klassens' release on bail at the first opportunity. Whether or not Miazga was over-protective of the children during the trial, it was the trial judge's role to balance the interests of the various parties, not the prosecutor's, and would not only be consistent with malice. Finally, Miazga's failure to apologize did not create an inference of malice, since Miazga was never asked whether he was remorseful. However, the court was split over whether Miazga was required to have a subjective belief in the guilt of the accused, and whether a lack of reasonable and probable grounds creates an inference of malice. Ultimately, the majority upheld the trial judge's decision. Reasons of the court The unanimous decision of the court was written by Charron J. The court upheld its prior decisions that there are four required elements for the tort of malicious prosecution: *The prosecution must be initiated by the defendant. *The prosecution must be terminated in the plaintiff's favour. *There was a lack of reasonable and probable grounds to commence or continue the prosecution. *The defendant was motivated to commence or continue to the prosecution due to malice. Initiated by the defendant In the case at bar, the first element was not at issue. Terminated in favour of the plaintiff Although there was some debate in the lower courts about whether the plea bargain affected the second element, it was not a live issue before the Supreme Court. Reasonable and probable grounds The Court recognized that \\"reasonable and probable grounds\\" is a lower standard than \\"reasonable prospect of conviction\\" (which is the standard used in most Crown offices), but noted that it remained appropriate. The Court found that \\"reasonable and probable grounds\\" is concerned with the Crown's professional, not personal opinion about the merits of the case. While a lack of a subjective belief of the plaintiff's guilt may be enough to meet the third requirement when the defendant is a private prosecutor, it is inconsistent with the role of a public prosecutor in upholding the public interest. The Court also noted that in reviewing whether there were reasonable and probable grounds, the court should only consider the facts available to the prosecutor at the time the decision was made, not the facts that later came out. In the case at bar, the Court found that there was no need to consider Miazga's lack of subjective belief that the plaintiffs were guilty. The court also found that even if Miazga had testified that he believed the plaintiffs were guilty, it would not have been outright unreasonable given the facts known to Miazga at the time. The Court also found that Miazga was allowed to put reliance on the court's original findings of guilt to support that he had reasonable and probable grounds. Malicious intent Malicious intent requires that a Crown was acting pursuant to an improper purpose that was inconsistent with the office of the Crown attorney. An honest but mistaken belief that there were reasonable and probable grounds does not support a finding of malicious intent. The Court also found that while the lack of a subjective belief of reasonable and probable grounds is a relevant factor in determining malice, it does not automatically equate with malice. It may be the result of inexperience, incompetence, negligence, or gross negligence ‚Äì none of which are the same as malicious intent. The Court noted that historically it may have made sense to infer malice when a private prosecutor had no reasonable or probable grounds ‚Äì otherwise, there would have been no reason to prosecute the case. However, public prosecutors may differ whether they personally believe there are reasonable and probable grounds, but may proceed anyway for reasons consistent with their role as a public prosecutor. Therefore, the Court found that malice could not be inferred when public prosecutors do not have reasonable and probable grounds. Since the Court of Appeal was unanimous there was no direct evidence of malicious intent of the part of Miazga, and the majority only found evidence of malice from the inference, the Supreme Court found that there was no evidence to support Miazga had any malicious intent. As a result, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and dismissed the action against Miazga. See also *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases External links *Full text of Miazga v.

He compiled and published the earliest printed collection of Russian folk-music. He was born near Belgorod, in Ivanovskaya Sloboda, where his father was assigned as a priest for the regimental settlement. In 1762 Trutovsky entered the Russian Imperial court as a singer and gusli player; he left the court some 30 years later. By 1792 Trutovsky was still active as a collector and composer, supported by various patrons from aristocratic families. He died around 1810 in Saint-Petersburg. Trutovsky's most important work is Sobraniye russkikh prost√Økh pesen s notami (–°–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—ã—Ö –ø–µ—Å–µ–Ω —Å –Ω–æ—Ç–∞–º–∏, \\"Collection of simple Russian songs with scores\\"), a collection of 80 folk-songs with melodies. It was the earliest published collection of its kind: the first three volumes appeared between 1776 and 1779, and one more followed in 1795. Trutovsky drew the material from both his own studies and from manuscripts compiled by others; he also included some Ukrainian songs, music by Russian composers, his own arrangements of music by others, etc. At first, Trutovsky only included the melody and a bass line, but volume 4 and a reprint of volume 1 contained more harmonic filling done by him. The Sobraine proved to be an influential work: more than half of its contents was published in a later important collection by Johann Gottfried Pratsch, and some of the songs provided inspiration and models for composers such as Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and others. Only a few of Trutovsky's own compositions survived: Kruzhka (–ö—Ä—É–∂–∫–∞, \\"A Cup\\"), a song for voice and piano (1777), and two sets of keyboard variations on folk- songs (1780): \\"Vo lesochke komarochkov\\" (–í–æ –ª–µ—Å–æ—á–∫–µ –∫–æ–º–∞—Ä–æ—á–∫–æ–≤, Lots of Gnats in Our Forest) and \\"Ty, detinushka, sirotinushka\\" (–¢—ã, –¥–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—É—à–∫–∞, —Å–∏—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–Ω—É—à–∫–∞, You, My Little Nowhere Child).

Dorsal slit An ancient practice, it has been a traditional custom among a number of peoples, particularly Filipinos and Pacific Islanders, probably for thousands of years. In Western medicine it was used as an alternative to circumcision to relieve conditions such as failure of the foreskin to retract (phimosis) or failure to cover the glans penis (paraphimosis), although a perception of poor appearance limited its popularity. While it is a less invasive surgery than circumcision, it is more invasive than preputioplasty since it leaves the incision open. It is still used when circumcision or other measures are considered impractical or undesirable. Traditional custom Since superincision and circumcision are both forms of genital cutting that expose the glans, it can often be difficult to know which procedure is being described or depicted. Opinion is divided on whether a 4,000-year-old image from Egypt, often described as the first depiction of circumcision, may in fact be of a superincision.Tasmania Law Reform Institute Non-Therapeutic Male Circumcision Issues Paper, No. 14, 2009. (p. 14) Superincision has been widely practised by people of the Pacific, stretching from Hawaii Milton Diamond incorrectly terms the procedure subincision, though it is clear superincision is meant. to the Philippines.Boyle, G and Ramos, S (2000). Ritual and Medical Circumcision among Filipino boys: Evidence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Humanities & Social Sciences papers, Bond University (p. 5) However, with increasing urbanisation, traditional rituals have been giving way in many places to medically performed circumcision, and almost entirely so among Islanders living in New Zealand, where a recent survey found there was \\"a strong cultural demand from parents\\". The most notable exception to Pacific superincision is the MƒÅori of New Zealand, who do not circumcise or superincise,Circumcision and MƒÅori by Valentino Kri≈æaniƒá although they have an indigenous term for the latter (ure haea or \\"split penis\\") and their tradition is that they stopped the practice when they arrived in New Zealand. Medical practice Phimosis Dorsal slit has a long history as a treatment for adult phimosis, since compared with circumcision it was relatively easy to perform, did not risk damage to the frenulum, and before the invention of antibiotics was less likely to become infected. However, the literature often indicates that despite being \\"a simple operation\\" it was \\"not liked by some\\" or refers to the \\"untidy apron-like appearance\\" it could produce. Dorsal slit is now rare in Western countries as a treatment for phimosis. Standard guidelines suggest conservative approaches first and, should those fail, either circumcision or preputioplasty to both retain the foreskin and relieve the phimosis. Paraphimosis and other conditions In some cases the foreskin may become swollen as a result of paraphimosis (foreskin trapped behind the glans) or other conditions such as severe balanitis. Should reduction of the swelling by conservative methods be unsuccessful, a dorsal slit is a common intervention of choice since circumcision is almost always excluded in such cases. While it was formerly recommended that circumcision be subsequently performed once the originating condition has subsided, this appears to be no longer the case.  Dorsal genital slits in some African tribes  A variety of \\"dorsal slit\\" circumcision was once predominant amongst the Maasai tribe of Kenya and Tanzania, and is still practised and found in many of the more remote regions of the very large area known as \\"Maasailand\\" generally. However, the Maasai operation is different in this: rather than a dorsal slit from the opening of the prepuce to the corona, a heart shaped \\"oval\\" is excised from the dorsum of the prepuce and the glans is pushed through this hole. Later the edges of the cut prepuce will heal. The prepuce is first cut off, leaving only a small part where the main veins are located, which is pulled down and the small hole through which the glans in pushed through is created. The remaining part is left hanging down, but the glans exposed. Formerly tribes that copied the Maasai like the numerous Kikuyu of Kenya also practised the same form of circumcision. Photos of the operation and result are numerously found in specialized African books, such as Carol Beckwith and Tepelit Ole Saitoti's Maasai. There are words for the resultant \\"prepuaial flap\\" in the Maa and Gikuyu languages, and possibly in other African tongues. In Gikuyu the word, now archaic, is likely to be ngwati. Dorsal slit reversal According to Goodwin, the dorsal slit operation may be reversed by suturing the cut ends together, which restores the tissue to its normal position and recreates the foreskin: > One patient presented with a dorsal slit because of an acute infection > during childhood. All of the normal preputial skin was still present and the > patient wished the skin restored to a normal appearance. An inverted > V-shaped incision was made where the dorsal slit had been and the two edges > were sutured together, thus, reproducing the normal prepuce. The patient was > delighted with the results. It could be that this might be an answer to some > critics of circumcision. A simple dorsal slit can be performed in patients > who have phimosis or severe recurrent infections. At a later date, if they > wished restoration, reconstruction to the uncircumcised appearance would be > simple.

The British launched an amphibious attack at the Humen strait (Bogue), capturing the forts on the islands of Anunghoy and North Wangtong. This allowed the fleet to proceed further up the Pearl River towards the city of Canton (Guangzhou), which they captured the following month.  Background  After the Second Battle of Chuenpi on 7January 1841, British Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot and Chinese Imperial Commissioner Qishan negotiated the Convention of Chuenpi on 20January;Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 327 a condition of which was that the port of Canton (Guangzhou) was to be opened for trade on 2February. However, no proclamation for the opening of the port appeared. On 11‚Äì12 February, Elliot and Qishan met again at the Bogue. Elliot acceded to a further delay (not to exceed ten days) for the treaty to be fairly prepared.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 328Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, pp. 329‚Äì330 Commodore James Bremer, commander-in-chief of British forces, wrote in his dispatch: Suspecting warlike intentions on the part of the Chinese, Bremer sailed to the Macao Roads (an anchorage east of Macao) on 13February to confer with Elliot. He found that the Nemesis was en route to Canton to demand ratification of the convention and had orders to wait until the night of 18February for an answer. On the morning of 19February, the Nemesis returned without a reply, and all doubt regarding the hostile intentions of the Chinese ended when the ship came under fire from North Wangtong. Later that evening, Qishan's and Elliot's intermediary Paoupang arrived in Macao in a chop-boat, announcing Qishan's refusal to sign the treaty and demanding ten more days to consider it. However, Elliot replied that fair means have been exhausted.Bingham 1843, p. 47 Bremer detached the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, Alligator, Modeste, and Sulphur under Captain Thomas Herbert to prevent further defensive preparations. In response, a proclamation from the Lieutenant-Governor of Canton, Eleang, announced a $30,000 reward for the heads of Bremer or Elliot, and $50,000 for anyone who could seize them alive, among other rewards.The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 175  Battle  Map of the battle, showing Anunghoy and the Wangtong Islands On 23February, Captain Herbert, accompanied by Elliot, sailed to the rear passage of Anunghoy Island aboard the Nemesis, with the pinnaces of the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, and Alligator in flotilla. As the fleet tried to clear the stakes placed across the river, they unexpectedly encountered a masked 20-gun battery almost abreast of the spot, which immediately opened fire. The Nemesis responded with a volley of grape and canister shots from the bow and stern guns, while the pinnaces sailed towards the shore to storm the battery, opening fire from their bow guns as they advanced. Herbert reported that 30 small Chinese junks and boats were \\"making off in the greatest confusion; our return fire was rapid and so energetically followed up by landing and pushing on to the attack, that the fort ... was immediately in our possession.\\"Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, pp. 331‚Äì332Bernard & Hall 1847, pp. 112‚Äì113 The Chinese fled after a slight resistance, whereupon their magazines, a few junks, and some boats were burned. The British disabled the 20 mounted guns of various calibre by breaking the trunnions. An additional 60 dismounted guns were found and rendered useless, excluding a few brass ones which were taken as trophies. There were no British casualties.Bernard & Hall 1847, p. 113 Herbert reported 20 to 30 Chinese dead. On the same day, former Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu wrote in his diary: \\"I hear that two small steamers belonging to the rebel English, with several small boats, sailed straight up to T'ai-p'ing-hs√º [behind Anson's Bay] in the Bogue, opened fire and set alight a number of peasants' houses, and also the Customs House.\\"Waley 1958, pp. 138‚Äì139 Since South Wangtong Island was unfortified by the Chinese, the British set up a battery there to target the forts on North Wangtong Island, which would also divert attention from the upcoming attack on Anunghoy. Shortly after midday on 25 February, the Nemesis embarked 130 troops of the 37th Madras Native Infantry (MNI) to assist in erecting a mortar battery on the island.Bernard & Hall 1847, pp. 114‚Äì115 In the evening, Captain W. J. Birdwood of the Madras Sappers and fellow engineer officers, with a working party of Royal and Madras Artillery, covered by the 37th MNI, erected a sand bag battery on a saddle in the middle of the island.Vibart 1883, p. 141Ouchterlony 1844, p. 112 Two 8-inch iron and one 24-pounder brass howitzer were put in position. During construction, the North Wangtong batteries fired during much of the night but their shots passed mostly above the site and slackened towards 2:00 am.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, pp. 274‚Äì275 At daylight on 26 February, the three howitzers fired shells and rockets into North Wangtong and occasionally into Anunghoy. British troops were ordered to be ready at 7:00 am,Bernard & Hall 1847, p. 116 but due to calm weather, the operation was delayed until 11:00 am, when the breeze was strong enough to sail.Ouchterlony 1844, p. 113 Chinese drawing of the Anunghoy forts, found in the house of Guan, representing the expected attack of the British Anunghoy's defences were the 42-gun South Anunghoy Fort (Weiyuan), the 60-gun Jingyuan Fort north of Weiyuan, and the 40-gun North Anunghoy Fort (Zhenyuan).Bingham 1843, p. 4Mao 2016, p. 200 Captain Humphrey Fleming Senhouse of the Blenheim‚Äîaided by the Melville, the steamer Queen, and four rocket boats‚Äîapproached the southern fort, dropped its anchor away, and fired broadsides from its starboard guns. The Melville approached five minutes later off the portside of the Blenheim, sailed within of the fort, and fired broadsides in quick succession.Bingham 1843, p. 58Bingham 1843, p. 59 A British officer wrote: \\"The firing of these ships was most splendid: nothing could withstand their deadly aim ... One or two shot were sufficient for the 'dragon-hearted' defenders of the north fort, who, 'letting' off their guns, fled up the hills.\\" At 1:20 pm,Ellis 1866, p. 164 after bombarding and silencing the forts, Senhouse landed on the southern battery with about 300 Royal Marines and bluejackets (sailors) carrying small arms to clear out the few remaining defenders. The same was done to the other two batteries.The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 177 By 1:30 pm, the forts were captured.Bingham 1843, p. 60The United Service Journal 1841, pp. 523‚Äì524 Chinese Admiral Guan Tianpei was among the estimated 250 killed or wounded in Anunghoy. After his family identified his body the next day, the Blenheim fired a minute-gun salute in his honour as his body was taken away.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 276 A Chinese bell that Senhouse captured was later sent to England and donated to St Mary's Church in Gosforth by his widow in 1844.Parker & Collingwood 1926, p. 60 North Wangtong's defences were the Wangtong Fort (Hengdang) on the eastern side and the 40-gun Yong'an Fort on the western side, flanked by a field work of 17 guns. A boom connected South Wangtong to the South Anunghoy Fort, where it was heaved or lowered by a windlass. It was composed of four parts of a chain cable supported by large wooden rafts.Bingham 1843, p. 5 A passage was not forced through it until after the forts were taken. The Wellesley (Commodore Bremer's flagship) and Druid targeted the southwest batteries, while the light division under Captain Hebert‚Äîcomprising the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, Alligator, Modeste, and Sulphur‚Äîtargeted the northwest and southeast batteries of the island,Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 334Bernard & Hall 1847, pp. 115, 117 which had 2,000 Chinese defenders.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, pp. 338‚Äì339 In less than an hour, the batteries were silenced. At 1:30 pm,Bernard & Hall 1847, p. 118 under Major Thomas Simson Pratt, 1,037 troops from the 26th and 49th regiments, 37th MNI, Bengal Volunteers, and Royal Marines landed on the rear of the southwest fort from the steamers Nemesis and Madagascar. Within minutes, the British captured the island and 1,300 Chinese surrendered. An estimated 250 Chinese were killed or wounded in Wangtong and 167 guns were captured.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 341 In total, five British were woundedBulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 340 and 339 artillery pieces were captured that day.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 342 Lin wrote in his records: \\"I got home at the Hour of the Monkey [3 p.m.] ... and when night came heard that the Bogue forts and those on Wantung Island were being invested, preparatory to attack, by the English rebels. I at once went with Deng to Qishan's office and at the Hour of the Rat [11 p.m.] we heard that the Wantung, Yung-an and Kung-ku forts have fallen. All night I could not sleep.\\"  Notes   References  *Bernard, William Dallas; Hall, William Hutcheon (1847). The Nemesis in China (3rd ed.). London: Henry Colburn. *Bingham, John Elliot (1843).

An alluvial plain is surrounded by steep uplands. Hills adjacent to Freshwater Lagoon have been identified as undivided pre-Cretaceous metasedimentary rock. Studies around Humboldt Bay indicate tectonic activity along the Cascadia subduction zone has caused local sea level changes at intervals of several centuries. The plain may support fresh water wetlands or Sitka Spruce forests following uplift events and salt marsh or inundated shellfish beds following subsidence events. The relatively small catchment basin tributary to Freshwater Lagoon has allowed formation of a durable coastal sand bar which has not been breached by recent storm events. Precipitation usually percolates through the bar without forming a surface channel. Recreation U.S. Route 101 traverses the coastal sand bar between Freshwater Lagoon and the Pacific Ocean. Convenient parking on the sand bar adjacent to the highway has made the lagoon a popular scenic rest area for motorists in Humboldt Lagoons State Park. There is also a Redwood National and State Parks visitor center near the north end of the lagoon.

Life He was born at Brixton, Devon. He entered, in Easter term 1619, as a batler in Magdalen Hall, Oxford, proceeding B.A. on 22 February 1624, and M.A. 1 June 1627. Taking orders, he became tutor in his hall for several years. His opinions were those of a Puritan, and were openly held. They attracted the attention of William Laud. Accepted Frewen, then president of Magdalen College, Oxford, relocated the communion-table in the college chapel, making it into an altar according to Puritan views. Several of the preachers at St Mary's Church inveighed against this innovation. Ford in his turn preached (on 2 Thess. ii. 10) 12 June 1631, and offered some reflections on making the Eucharist a sacrifice, setting up altars instead of tables, and bowing to them. This plain speaking having excited the wrath of the Laudian party, the next Saturday the vice- chancellor William Smyth called Ford before him and demanded a copy of his sermon. Ford offered to give him one if he demanded it ‚Äòstatutably.‚Äô The vice- chancellor then ordered him to surrender himself prisoner at the castle. He refused to go unless accompanied by a beadle or a servant. The following Saturday the vice-chancellor sealed up his study, and afterwards searched his books and papers, but found nothing that could be urged against him. In the meantime an information was sent to Laud, then chancellor of the university, who returned orders to punish the preachers. Thereupon a citation in his name was fixed on St. Mary's, 2 July, commanding Ford's appearance before the vice- chancellor on the 5th. Appearing on the day appointed he was pressed to take an oath, ex officio, to answer any questions about his sermon; but he refused it, because there were no interrogatories in writing. He again offered a copy of his sermon if demanded according to the statutes, and the next day delivered one, which was accepted. But on pretence of former contumacy the vice-chancellor commanded him again to surrender himself prisoner. Ford appealed from him to the congregation, and delivered his appeal in writing to the proctors (Atherton Bruch and John Doughty). They carried it to convocation, who referred the cause to delegates, a majority of whom, upon a full hearing, acquitted him of all breach of the peace. From them the vice- chancellor himself appealed to convocation, who again appointed delegates; but the time limited by statute expired before they could arrive at a decision. Laud then brought the cause before the king and council, who heard it at Woodstock 23 August. Ford, when questioned by the king, stuck to his statement. In the end he was sentenced to quit the university within four days. Many of the scholars in their gowns, assembled at Magdalen to conduct him out of the city. Soon afterwards Ford was invited by the magistrates of Plymouth to become their lecturer. Laud procured letters from the king forbidding the townsmen to elect Ford on pain of his majesty's displeasure, and another to the Bishop of Exeter, commanding him not to admit him in case he should be elected. Ford went abroad as chaplain to an English regiment under the command of Colonel George Fleetwood, in the service of Gustavus Adolphus. He travelled with the colonel into Germany, and was for some time in garrison at Stode and Elbing. The English merchants at Hamburg invited him to be their minister, but he returned home. He was instituted to the rectory of Aldwinkle All Saints, Northamptonshire, 18 October 1637, a preferment which he owed to Sir Myles Fleetwood. In 1640 he was elected proctor for the clergy of the diocese of Peterborough in the convocation which framed the so-called et cetera oath. He held his rectory for ten years; but on the outbreak of the First English Civil War, after a short stay at Exeter, he retired to London, and was chosen minister of St Faith under St Paul's, and in 1644, on the death of Oliver Bowles, a member of the Westminster Assembly. Ford afterwards settled at Exeter, where he exercised an evangelical ministry. He preached in the choir of Exeter Cathedral, as his brother pastors, Lewis Stucley and Thomas Mall, did in the nave. Calamy relates that in 1649, Major-general John Desborough, who quartered there, expelled Ford for refusing the engagement. He was appointed minister of St. Lawrence, Exeter, and also acted as an assistant-commissioner for Devon. The enforcement of the Act of Uniformity 1662 obliged him to desist from preaching publicly. A year later he was compelled by the Oxford Act to move to Exmouth, about nine miles from Exeter, where he lived very privately. When the Declaration of Indulgence came out he returned to Exeter, but in feeble health. He died in December 1674, in his seventy-sixth year, and was buried on the 28th in St. Lawrence's Church, Exeter, near his wife, Bridget Fleetwood, and several of his children. Works His writings are as follows: * ‚ÄòSinging of Psalmes the duty of Christians under the New Testament, or a vindication of that Gospel-Ordinance in V sermons upon Ephesians v. 19,‚Äô London, 1659; 2nd edit., with additions, the same year. * ‚ÄòThe Sinner condemned of himself: being a Plea for God against all the Ungodly, proving them alone guilty of their own destruction,‚Äô London, 1668. * ‚ÄòScripture's Self-Evidence, proving it to be the only Rule of Faith‚Äô. He preached once before the commons, 30 July 1645, and once before the lords, at a fast held 29 April 1646, and his sermons were published.

The majority of Conservative Mennonite churches historically have an Amish and not a Mennonite background. Those identifying with this group typically drive automobiles, have telephones, and use electricity, and some may have personal computers. They also have Sunday school, hold revival meetings, and operate their own Christian schools/parochial schools. History The majority of Conservative Mennonite churches historically have an Amish and not a Mennonite background. They emerged mostly from the middle group between the Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites. For more, see Amish Mennonite: Division 1850‚Äì1878.\\"An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups\\", Intercourse PA 1996, page 122-123. The largest group, the Conservative Mennonite Conference, was founded as the Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference in 1910 but dropped the word \\"Amish\\" in 1954. In the 1950 they were joined by conservative withdrawals from the mainstream Mennonites.\\"An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups\\", Intercourse PA 1996, page 128. \\"The first of these conservative withdrawals from the Mennonite Church occurred in the 1950s, and they continue in the 1990s. Many independent single congregations developed from this exodus.\\"\\"An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups\\", Intercourse PA 1996, page 159. \\"Independently and almost simultaneously, conservative minorities in widely scattered regional Conferences of the Mennonite Church came to the point where they had had enough of what they considered compromise and apostasy. They were disenchanted with the Conference structure and its failure to deal with drift. They decided to launch out on their own.\\"Scott (1996), p. 167 Beginning in late 1958 through 1960 a large number of individuals and congregations withdrew from various Mennonite Conferences, forming congregationally governed or independent Mennonite congregations. These later informally began what is called the Nationwide Fellowship Churches. In Ontario a group formed what is called the Conservative Mennonite Churches of Ontario or CMCO. These individuals and congregations felt that the mainstream Mennonite churches were no longer holding to the traditional and conservative values of the Anabaptist Mennonite tradition.  Beliefs  These are sometimes referred to as Distinctives * Authority of the Scriptures * Their view of Christ * Distinctive view of the Christian * High view of the Church including discipline * The two kingdom concept * Liberty of conscience * Voluntary Church membership * Belief in free will (closely associated with Arminianism in the Protestant tradition). (See also Free will in theology). * Believer's baptism * Discipleship * Separation of Church and state * Nonresistance * Non swearing of oaths * Separation and nonconformity to the world in many areas including clothing (See Modesty). * Innocence of children * Evangelistic zeal * Victory in the Christian life is possible * Closed communion * Simplicity in lifestyle * Simplicity of worship. This includes A cappella singing, segregated seating (in some churches) and kneeling prayer. * Lay leadership and the plural ministry * Christian woman's veiling: 1 Corinthians 11:1‚Äì16 still applies today. (See Christian headcovering). Conservative Mennonites characteristically conduct worship services in the language of the country which they inhabit. This is in contrast to most Old Order groups which still conduct their services in German. They differ from the Old Order groups mainly in their acceptance of certain technologies or modern inventions, are evangelical, and conduct missions. The more conservative groupings also operate their own private Christian day schools (operated by free will offerings) in preference to promoting homeschooling. They teach abstinence from alcohol (crudely referred to as teetotalism) and tobacco as well as temperance in all areas of life. They have a strong work ethic and frequently serve their communities and other areas in times of natural disaster through organized work programs, for instance Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. Conservative Mennonites along with Old Order Mennonites, and Amish hold to the basic tenets of Creation science including believing in a literal six-day creation. Conservative Mennonites uphold the following confessions of faith: The Schleitheim Confession of Faith (1527), the Dordrecht Confession of Faith (1632), The Christian Fundamentals (1921) adopted at Garden City, Missouri (commonly called the Garden City Confession), and the Nationwide churches also use The Hartville Restatement of the Christian Fundamentals (1964). Ministry Conservative Mennonites believe in a three-office ministry working together in what is called a plural ministry. They ordain deacons, ministers, and bishops from within their congregations by a process called the lot. Members of the ministry are not salaried, but most churches support their ministry team financially through free-will offerings. Administration The Washington County, Maryland and Franklin County, Pennsylvania Conference, Ohio Wisler Mennonites, Conservative Mennonite Churches of York and Adams Counties, Pennsylvania, the Pilgrim Mennonite Conference and the Eastern Pennsylvania Mennonite Church operate under a form of administration called a conference where each congregation has a common discipline (standard or constitution). The churches may be grouped in a district with one or two bishops sharing responsibility jointly or in part over a number of congregations within the district. This is a characteristic shared in common with most Old Order Mennonite groups. The Nationwide Fellowship churches are more congregational and whenever feasible a bishop will serve over one congregation but may assist with others and most congregations having their own unique discipline with elements in common. This congregational emphasis characteristic is shared in common with the Old Order Amish, Mennonite Christian Fellowship, Beachy Amish, and Tennessee Brotherhood churches. Congregations There are a number of congregations which have splintered or moved away from these beginning groups and have formed different fellowships. The earliest group began to be associated informally together in what was called the Conservative Mennonite Fellowship beginning in 1956. Most of these congregations were of Amish Mennonite origin, coming from the Conservative Mennonite Conference. They began the earliest mission work among the conservative groups in the early 1960s in Chimaltenago, Guatemala (on the Eastern side). What remained of these congregations joined the Nationwide Fellowship Churches in 1997. Another group was the only conference to remain conservative, namely the Washington County, Maryland/Franklin County, Pennsylvania Conference (founded in 1790) centered mostly around Hagerstown, Maryland. Their history to 1960 has been published.Daniel R. Lehman, Mennonites of the Washington County, Maryland and Franklin County, Pennsylvania Conference, Eastern Mennonite Publications, Ephrata, Pennsylvania, 1990. A third grouping peacefully requested to withdraw from the Lancaster Mennonite Conference (located centrally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania) in 1968 requesting to keep the 1954 discipline that was being revised. This group bears the name Eastern Pennsylvania Mennonite Church. Another group geographically centered in York and Adams counties in Pennsylvania withdrew later from the Lancaster Conference in the early 1970s under the direction of their bishop Richard Danner. They are called the Conservative Mennonite Churches of York and Adams Counties, Pennsylvania. Another group located in the Ohio counties of Wayne, Medina, Columbiana and Richland have their origin in the Wisler Conferences of Ohio and Michigan (an Old Order Mennonite grouping). In more recent years they have identified with the values of the Conservative Mennonites. They are called the Ohio Wisler Mennonites. Over the years there have been various regroupings among these groups, with numerous independent congregations forming and reforming. The most conservative groups do not have television or radio and shun or do not use the Internet. There are some websites nevertheless arising among those following this group; pilgrimministry.org is one such example. Finding external links or publications of this group online is rare because of their various stands. Mission outreaches of these groups can be found in the Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, India, Philippines, and the beginnings of work in England, Tasmania, Australia, and Argentina/Bolivia. Conservative Mennonites share similar beliefs and values as the Mennonite Christian Fellowship and Ambassadors Amish Mennonite Churches groups and the more traditionally conservative groups like the Berea Amish Mennonite Fellowship and the Tennessee Brotherhood Churches.  England and Ireland  In Ireland, there is a Beachy Amish Mennonite Church in Dunmore East. They are not affiliated directly with Conservative Mennonites but share similar beliefs. Their website is http://www.anabaptistireland.org/about-us/ it includes downloadable sermons. In England: # United Kingdom Mennonite Ministry, Shropshire Hills Mennonite Church, meet, on Sundays, (about 30 people), at the village hall, Aston on Clun, near Craven Arms, Shropshire, (and, once a month, at Old Sodbury near Bristol). The Americans here are under sponsorship of the (North Central) Nationwide Fellowship Mennonites from Wisconsin (USA). Members are operating Shepherd Hills Christian Bookstore Unit 3, Station Court, Shrewsbury Road, Craven Arms, SY7 9PY. They also sell high quality wood furniture in Shrewsbury and Craven Arms. Their annual Conference is attended by about 200 people and is held at Cefn Lea for weekend in early December.  Australia  In Australia, there are Nationwide Fellowship Mennonite congregations in Deloraine, Tasmania and also in Canowindra, New South Wales (Lachlan Valley Mennonite Church). The Tasmanian congregation sponsor annual weekend meetings in February of each year. There is also a plain Mennonite congregation in Queensland called the Australian Christian Brotherhood.  Intermediate and Moderate Conservative Mennonite groupings  These groups do not share the same level of strictness as the most conservative ones mentioned above but have similar origins or have withdrawn from the groupings above (like making the use of the radio optional or allowing more usage of the internet). Southeastern Mennonite Conference officially began upon their withdrawal from Virginia Mennonite Conference in June 1972. Others have formed from their withdrawal from the groups mentioned above. These include much smaller groups like (but not limited to): Bethel Fellowship, Mid Atlantic Fellowship, and Midwest Mennonite Fellowship, and numerous unaffiliated congregations. Publishing The most conservative groups operate the following publishing house: Rod and Staff Publishers in Crockett, Kentucky, offering both a full conservative Christian curriculum for home and traditional classroom settings as well as a complete bible study/Sunday school curriculum and periodicals. They also publish numerous reading materials for all ages. They publish mostly in English and Spanish with some German language publications. Rod and Staff was the first modern publisher of Christian school and homeschooling curricula beginning in 1962. Lamp and Light Publishers offers free Correspondence Courses in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. They are located in Farmington, New Mexico. Neither publisher has a website. The Eastern Pennsylvania Mennonite Church operates its own publishing house offering curriculum for home and traditional classroom settings and other books and are located in Ephrata, Pennsylvania ‚Äî Eastern Mennonite Publications. They offer Spanish publications and Bible Studies through their Spanish publishing house in Guatemala - Quetzaltenango Mennonite Publishers QMP. The Eastern Pennsylvania Mennonite Church publishes a monthly paper called The Eastern Mennonite Testimony. The Washington/Franklin Conference has in recent years also begun publishing under the name Brotherhood Publications. They publish a quarterly publication called The Brotherhood Builder. Christian Light Publications is a publishing house in Harrisonburg, Virginia, operated by a 9-member board and 15-member advisory board from many of the conservative conferences and fellowships: Southeastern, Mid-Atlantic, MidWest, Beachy, and others. They offer a full line of grade school, high school, Sunday school, and bible school curricula as well as periodicals, trade books, and more.

Poet Bianca Stone wrote that Animal Spirits brought \\"the world of raptorial desire out into the open, blurring, even bruising, the lines that divide us from animal. ...Healy works his eloquent sorcery on the crude but complicated facts of human desire. Animal Spirits conjures a complicated world of emotion in which we are stung by pain even as we are stunned into joy.\\" Healy's third book of poems, Velvet, was published in 2017 also from Monk Books.

All cadets were members of the Navy Junior Reserve Officers Corps, the U.S. Navy's youth organization. Bataan opened at the beginning of the 2007‚Äì2008 school year with freshmen and sophomores. The school closed at the end of the 2015‚Äì2016 school year due to declining enrollment. The Academy is named to commemorate the soldiers and sailors who were surrendered to Japanese forces on Luzon in 1942. During a forced removal to a POW camp, some 70,000 of these American and Philippine soldiers died during what later became known as the Bataan Death March. In remembrance of these brave men, many of whom were from New Mexico's 200th Coastal Artillery, BMA Cadets participate in the annual 26 mile Bataan Death March Memorial Marathon held at the U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Campus The campus was Located in Albuquerque, NM Students Students are selected by an interview with the principal and NSI. Courses include standard high-school curriculum. Through the IDEAL New Mexico program, an online high school curriculum, Cadets are able to take additional courses, such as advanced mathematics and AP classes. During the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, all incoming New Mexico high school freshmen are required to attend at least one advanced placement or dual-credit course during their high-school years. BMA is working with Central New Mexico Community College and the University of New Mexico to satisfy that goal. Naval Science U.S. Naval Science is a unique course offered by BMA. The course includes military history, traditions, uniform regulations, basic military regulations, military-related career exploration, how to identify and report sexual harassment, the military's no drug/alcohol policies, and an emphasis on building leadership skills. The Cadet rank system is based on the following: Time in service, completion of course work available through U.S. Naval Science classes. Physical Training Bataan Cadets are required to PT every Wednesday according to the Navy PT standards. Student will have to be able to do push ups, sit-ups, and a mile run. Ethics The U.S. Navy's standards of \\"Honor, Courage and Commitment,\\" are taught and implemented in Academy relationships. Ethics and morals are instilled every day through military drill and a military environment. BMA follows an Honor Code which states, ‚ÄúCadets do not lie, cheat or steal, and will not tolerate those who do.‚Äù Extra Curricular Activities include basketball, color guard, rifle team, and a drill team. Mascot: Heraldic Sea Lion As World War II began, a U.S. submarine happened to be docked on the Philippine Island of Luzon. On the third day after the events at Pearl Harbor, Japanese air forces bombed the submarine. Several U.S. sailors died as most were on shore. Later, Japanese ground forces invaded the island and eventually captured American and Filipino troops leading to the events of the Death March. After the war and the return to the U.S., survivors of the Bataan Death March formed an organization named the Battling Bastards of Bataan. They selected the heraldry symbol of a sea lion to represent the organization. Dating to the year 400 AD, the sea lion represented the men who fought to protect the coastal waters. Bataan Military Academy proudly presents the sea lion as its mascot. Former Navy artist Jim Pearson of Albuquerque was commissioned to create a contemporary version of the sea lion. It is his conceptual version that is used by the Academy. Military Life As Cadets do not live at the Academy, discipline is reinforced by adult Instructors and Senior Cadets. Such discipline is crucial to maintaining the integrity and leadership-building qualities that are valued at the school. Military Organization Cadets are organized into platoons consisting of their Naval Science classes. (Typically in the same grade level) Platoon structure is as follows: Platoon Commander, Platoon Leading Petty Officer, Platoon Yeoman, Squad Leaders (1-4). Battalion Command is as follows: Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, Administrative Officer, Operations Officer, Supply Officer, Safety Officer, Morale/Welfare/Recreation Officer, Training Officer, Public Affairs Officer, Command Chief.

The video was later uploaded onto YouTube by Geoff Swanson, where it gained large viewership and continued to increase in popularity, leading to a series of sequels and spinoffs. The video was a viral hit, accumulating 67 million views and gaining worldwide praise. A merchandising line was later produced, as well as three sequels and a parody series titled . The first three episodes in the series were released to DVD in 2009 as part of The FilmCow Master Collection. Plot In a quiet meadow, Charlie, a unicorn, is resting, before he is awakened by two other unicorns. As Charlie awakes from his slumber, the other two unicorns inform him that they have found a map to the mythical \\"Candy Mountain,\\" and that he must come with them on their journey. Charlie initially refuses and goes back to sleep. The blue unicorn begins to jump on Charlie, insistent that he should come, and both begin to pester him with details of the mountain, causing him to begrudgingly give in to their demands. The trio begins their journey in a forest, where the two lead Charlie to a Liopleurodon; the two unicorns converse with the Liopleurodon, who supposedly guides them on their quest with a simple roar. The trio then crosses a bridge, much to the delight of the pink and blue unicorns, who repeatedly tell him that they are on a bridge. When the trio arrives at Candy Mountain, the letters of the CANDY sign come to life and the \\"Y\\" sings a song, closely resembling the tune of Klarinettenmuckl-Jodler, (also known as The Clarinet Polka) welcoming Charlie to the mountain and imploring Charlie to go into the cave. After the letters explode, Charlie reluctantly goes into the cave. The other unicorns say goodbye as Charlie is locked inside and knocked out by an unknown assailant. When he awakens in his original spot, he realizes that they have taken one of his kidneys, much to his dismay. The video then immediately ends with the credits. Characters * Jason Steele plays Charlie the Unicorn, a grouchy lethargic unicorn who is badgered by his two unicorn companions to travel with them to the mythical Candy Mountain. Charlie speaks with a North Eastern American accent. He acts cynical throughout the trip and fails to believe that such a place could be real. To his surprise, the Candy Mountain turns out to actually exist. * Steele also plays two gender-ambiguous blue and pink unicorns, named Lolz and Roffle, though their names are never mentioned and only came to light when the original script was uploaded on his website. They convince Charlie to travel with them to the mythical Candy Mountain. Throughout the video, the two lead him into several nonsensical situations, including receiving directions from a \\"magical\\" Liopleurodon and crossing a \\"magical bridge of hope and wonder\\". By the end of the video, the trio reach Candy Mountain, where the two and the Candy Mountain marquee letters convince Charlie to enter the mountain cave. Creator Jason Steele has revealed very little about the two in the following Charlie the Unicorn videos for humorous value, most notably their genders and, until March 2016, their names; he claims to believe that his characters are \\"somewhat scary\\"Charlie the Unicorn Adult Swim Pitch, in The FilmCow Master Collection: 200 Years of Excellence [DVD]. 2009. Kunaki. and \\"more interesting\\" when a small amount of information is revealed about them. * In his first musical role in the Charlie the Unicorn series, Steele performs the singing voice of the Letter \\"Y\\", an anthropomorphic letter who resides alongside letters \\"C\\", \\"A\\", \\"N\\", and \\"D\\" on the Candy Mountain marquee. He performs the musical number \\"The Candy Mountain Cave\\", accompanied by the other letters. * An unintelligible Liopleurodon ( in the video as opposed to ) character billed as the Magical Liopleurodon was also featured in the video. The character (presumably) communicates in his species' natural call, and is called upon by the blue and pink unicorns to guide them to Candy Mountain. Production Independent animator Jason Steele initially conceived Charlie the Unicorn in 2005 as a flash animation test for his mother, who enjoyed unicorn-related conversation.Steele, Jason. (2009). Commentary for Charlie the Unicorn, in The FilmCow Master Collection: 200 Years of Excellence [DVD]. Kunaki. Steele first imagined the video's plotline when he was running around his house, chanting \\"La la la!\\" repeatedly, then quickly envisioned the majority of the plotline shortly thereafter; according to Steele, the video's conception happened \\"all at once; there was no editing.\\" The video is primarily structured around surrealist humor and dark humor. Steele claims that the former was inspired by musician Logan Whitehurst, who frequently communicated with Steele via e-mail and composed the theme song for his 2003 computer-animated short film Secret Agent Bob; he describes the latter as \\"contrast[ing] to how bright and cheerful\\" the video's atmosphere is.Steele, Jason. (2009). Commentary for Charlie the Unicorn 2, in The FilmCow Master Collection: 200 Years of Excellence [DVD]. Kunaki. Steele drew Charlie the Unicorn using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Flash, and animated it in After Effects and edited in Final Cut Pro. The audio was recorded using Amadeus Pro, and the music was recorded with Logic Pro. The video also contains a musical number titled \\"The Candy Mountain Cave\\", featured during the sequence where Charlie refuses to enter the Candy Mountain Candy Cave, sung by the mountain's marquee letter \\"Y\\", who is backed by his partners \\"C\\", \\"A\\", \\"N\\", and \\"D\\". Although the blue and pink unicorns were originally chosen to sing the song, Steele was unable to use their voices to sing at a rapid pace, and resorted to using the Letter \\"Y\\" instead. Reception Charlie the Unicorn has become increasingly popular since its inception. Following its posting on Newgrounds in 2005, Geoff Swanson of YouTube posted a copy of the video on the website in 2006, where it rapidly gained popularity. It reached a total of approximately 8 million views internetwide in 2007. The video climbed to forty-six million views in March 2010. It currently has 68 million views on Geoff Swanson's YouTube upload, and 35 million views on FilmCow's official YouTube upload. Online magazine Salon described the video as \\"The unlikely adventure of a crotchety unicorn\\" and stated \\"We often feel like Charlie the Unicorn. Annoying, brightly colored colleagues poke at us with their curly horns as we snooze at our desk, promising far-off, sugar-coated delights. Do we muster the energy to follow them, hoping some sweet payoff will break the unbearable bleakness of our daily existence? Can they be trusted?\\" The series has also attracted a number of celebrities, including British television personality Alex Zane, who has openly considered himself a fan of Charlie the Unicorn, and entertainers Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn. Brian Hamlin of The Hollywood Reporter considered the video to be \\"incredibly dumb and annoying\\" yet \\"really funny and weird too full of unicorn joyness and music.\\" In 2009, Time named Charlie the Unicorn number 49 in their list of \\"YouTube's 50 Best Videos\\", stating \\"Charlie the Unicorn proves that something doesn't have to make any sense at all to earn a cultlike following.\\" Merchandising lines produced by a partnership consisting of FilmCow and retailer CafePress as well as Hot Topic have been launched in response to the video's popularity; the merchandise features various quotes from the video and generally features the pink and blue unicorns, although Charlie appears occasionally, and is sold in several forms including t-shirts, pins, coffee mugs, and bandannas. Sequels, spinoffs, and parodies 5 sequels have been released: Charlie the Unicorn 2 (2008), Charlie the Unicorn 3 (2009), Charlie the Unicorn 4 (2012), Charlie the Unicorn: The Grand Finale (Part One) (2019), and Charlie the Unicorn: The Grand Finale (Part Two) (2020). On 23 February 2016, Film Cow released a video called \\"Charlie the Unicorn: The Grand Finale Kickstarter\\" in which it was announced that there was a thirty minute finale planned. On 24 February, it was announced in a Live Stream of Charlie the Unicorn that if enough money for the finale was raised, then Aubrey Plaza would be hired to voice all of the characters. Steele released the first part of the \\"Grand Finale\\" on YouTube on October 10, 2019, expecting to follow it up with five more parts. The second part was released on June 15, 2020. The cast of Charlie the Unicorn also appeared on May 23, 2008, in the music video for Weezer's single \\"Pork and Beans\\". The music video was directed by Mathew Cullen of the video production company Motion Theory and features many internet phenomena, including Charlie and the blue and pink unicorns. The character of Charlie first appears in a sequence parodying the G.I. Joe public service announcements starring animated versions of the band as children, where the character Gung-Ho of the G.I. Joe franchise appears as their mentor and notably has a tattoo of Charlie on his chest. All three unicorns appear at the end alongside the band and various other phenomena. On November 22, 2008, as a feature of the YouTube Live streamed event, the cast of Charlie the Unicorn were featured in a short film directed by creator Jason Steele featuring YouTube Live colliding with real life, causing several various memes to come to life, namely Rick Astley making a comeback and the world's weather conditions being altered in favor of raining chocolate.Steele, Jason. (2009). Commentary for YouTube Live \\"Charlie the Unicorn\\" Video, in The FilmCow Master Collection: 200 Years of Excellence [DVD]. Kunaki. The short sequence was promoted with a forty-three-second video depicting Charlie and the two unicorns attempting to defuse a bomb before being attacked by a large group of seagulls; the short had no connection whatsoever to the video it was promoting other than advertising purposes.Steele, Jason. (2009). Commentary for YouTube Live \\"Charlie the Unicorn Promo\\", in The FilmCow Master Collection: 200 Years of Excellence [DVD]. Kunaki. On March 1, 2009, creator Jason Steele released a video to accompany Hot Topic's Charlie the Unicorn merchandising line titled Charlie the Unicorn and the Tomb of Horrors; the video follows Charlie and the two unicorns scaling an ancient chamber inhabited by \\"The Weasel,\\" a shamanist weasel who has attempted to call upon forces of evil that laid waste to the world ten thousand years prior. The video \\"Charlie the Unicorn at Playlist Live\\" was released on the 28th of March, 2013. Steele also produced a parody series consisting of four shorts and titled \\"Charlie teh Unicron\\". \\"Charlie teh Unicron\\" is based around \\"what the Charlie the Unicorn series would be like if it was written by random internet people\\". Another parody, \\"Charlie the Yannicorn\\" was made in 2013. That same year, during the Detective Heart of America: The Final Freedom Kickstarter, another parody \\"Charlie the Unitective Heart of America\\" was released, featuring Heart of America as Charlie. Although not released on FilmCow's main channel, it can be found on a playlist. Multiple livestreams featuring Charlie answering questions, telling jokes, and just generally talking to the viewers were conducted on the FilmCow YouTube channel as part of a promotion for the finale Kickstarter in early 2016. As of December 2017, only \\"Charlie the Unicorn's LIVE Oscars Spectacular!\\" - a stream which ran at the same time as the 88th Academy Awards - has been made publicly available (though unlisted) since the original streams were conducted. A game titled \\"Charlie the Unicorn Dating Simulator\\" and a storybook titled \\"Charlie the Unicorn: Lost in Dream Space\\" were released by Steele in 2016. According to Steele, the storybook is \\"an illustrated side-adventure that takes place a little while after the end of Charlie the Unicorn 2\\".

It is monocarpic, flowering only once before dying, which gives rise to its common name of the \\"suicide tree\\". Reproduction Tachigali versicolor reproduces only once in its lifetime once the trees are mature. Within a year of flowering the tree rapidly dies and falls over. The trait was first noticed by Robin Foster in 1970, while working in Panama. Carlos Fonseca reported that another species in the genus, Tachigali myrmecophila is also monocarpic. The age at which they reproduce is unknown, however, and growth rates vary widely depending on the amount of light that the trees grow in. Reproduction (and death) has been observed to occur in a four to six year cycle; if flowering occurs one year then it will not occur for the next three to five years. When studied on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, they were observed to flower in 1970, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1989 and 1994. Despite the suicidal nature of their reproductive strategy they do not appear to divert any more nutrients into their one set of seeds than other similar trees. While apparently maladaptive, the strategy has been suggested to be effective at maintaining populations, as when the parent tree dies it creates a gap in the canopy which the seedlings require to grow. Flowering occurs between January and July, with individuals flowering for between 6 and 12 weeks. The fruits are large, wind dispersed samaras and they mostly fall within 100m of the parent tree. The seeds, which weigh around half a gram are predated while still on the tree by parrots and bruchid beetles (Amblycerus tachygaliae) and once on the forest floor by rodents, peccaries and fungi. The seeds lack dormancy and germinate in late April and early May. The seedlings are tolerant of shade and can survive for many years in the understorey while waiting for a gap in the canopy to form. Seedlings are more likely to survive growing under the canopy of other T. versicolor trees than under trees of a different species. For the first two months after germination, those that grow in the shade are more likely to survive because less grazing occurs in the shade. After two months those in light gaps are more likely to survive. Each tree produces around 50,000 seeds of which 30% germinate and 5% survive for more than two years. If light conditions change the seedlings are able to quickly adapt to the new conditions by growing new leaves that are especially adapted to capture the light level. Compared to other monocarpic trees that grow in similar environments, T. versicolor has relatively high seed mass, dispersal capability, photosynthetic flexibility and seedling survival in the shaded understory in the first year of growth. Ecology Leaf cutter ants do not harvest the leaves of the suicide tree, presumably because the leaves contain anti-fungal chemicals which would kill the fungus they depend on to digest leaves. Symbionts As a member of the family Fabaceae it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria. The bacteria found in the trees nodules are from the genus Bradyrhizobium.Divergent Bradyrhizobium symbionts on Tachigali versicolor from Barro Colorado Island, Panama Parker MA Source: SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY Volume: 23 Issue: 4 Pages: 585-590 Published: DEC 2000 Uses Indigenous people in the Amazon basin use an extract of the tree to treat fungal skin infections and it is also used as timber.http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/herbarium/species/17795/?fam=Fabaceae%2Fcaes.&page;=7 References External links *Images of Tachigali versicolor at Discover Life Category:Caesalpinioideae Category:Flora of Central America Category:Flora of Colombia Category:Flora of Costa Rica Category:Flora of Panama Category:Trees of Central America Category:Trees of South America ","title":"Tachigali versicolor"},{"id":"25036565","text":"The history of the Los Angeles Dodgers begins in the 19th century when the team was based in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn Dodgers history The franchise now known as the Dodgers was originally formed in 1883 as a member of the minor league Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. It moved to the American Association the following year and eventually to the National League in 1890. The team went by a number of press-bestowed nicknames including the Brooklyn Atlantics, Brooklyn Grays, Brooklyn Bridegrooms, Brooklyn Grooms, Brooklyn Superbas, and Brooklyn Robins before the team settled on Brooklyn Dodgers (from Trolley Dodgers) in the World War 1 era. During the Brooklyn era, the team won the AA championship in 1889 and National League championships 12 times (1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 1956) and won their first World Series championship in . The Brooklyn Dodgers had several Hall of Fame players on their rosters during this era including Roy Campanella, Leo Durocher, Burleigh Grimes, Willie Keeler, Pee Wee Reese, Wilbert Robinson, Duke Snider, Dazzy Vance, Zack Wheat and Jackie Robinson. Robinson, the first African American to play major professional baseball, made his debut as a Dodger in 1947 and won the first Rookie of the Year award. The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2‚Äì0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Los Angeles Dodgers The Alston years On April 18, 1958, the Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game in LA, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6‚Äì5, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Sadly, catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play for Los Angeles. The process of building Walter O'Malley's dream stadium soon began in semi-rural Chavez Ravine, in the hills just north of downtown L.A. There was some political controversy, as the residents of the ravine, mostly Hispanic and mostly poor, resisted the eminent domain removal of their homes (land which had been previously condemned for a public housing project, Elysian Park Heights) and gained some public sympathy. Still, O'Malley and the city government were determined, and construction proceeded. The resistance of the residents against their removal was known as the Battle of Chavez Ravine. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, pictured during the 1959 World Series. In the meantime, the Dodgers played their home games from 1958 to 1961 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a gargantuan football and track-and-field stadium that had been built in 1923, and then expanded to host the 1932 Summer Olympics. The Coliseum's dimensions were not optimal for baseball, and the best way to fit a baseball diamond into the oval-shaped stadium was to lay the third-base line parallel to the short axis of the oval, and the first-base parallel to the long axis. This resulted in a left-field fence that was only about from home plate. A 40-foot high screen was erected to prevent home runs from becoming too trivial to hit. Still, the 1958 season saw 182 home runs hit to left field in the home games, whereas just three were hit to center field, and only eight to right field. The Dodgers outfielder Wally Moon, newly acquired for the 1959 season, became adept at launching lazy fly balls over or onto the screen, which became known as \\"Moon shots.\\" He led the National League with triples in 1959. In 1959, the season ended in a tie between the Dodgers and the Milwaukee Braves. The Dodgers won the tie-breaking playoff. 1959 also saw a team other than the Yankees win the A.L. pennant, one of only two such years in the 16-year stretch from 1949 through 1964, and because of the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, this resulted in the first World Series since 1948 to have no games in New York City. In a lively World Series, the Dodgers defeated the \\"Go-Go\\" White Sox in six games, thoroughly cementing the bond between the baseball team and its new Southern California fans. Commemorating their 50th year in Los Angeles, the Dodgers would play one more game in the Memorial Coliseum on March 29, 2008 ‚Äì an exhibition game to benefit a cancer research charity. The crowd of 115,300, the largest in baseball history in any country, any league, saw the Dodgers lose to the Boston Red Sox by a score of 7‚Äì4. Due to intervening renovations, the Coliseum's left field corner was shortened to only 190 feet, calling for an even-taller left-field fence of 60 feet. Kevin Cash of the Red Sox and James Loney of the Dodgers did hit home runs over that fence, but there were unexpectedly few home runs in the game. Despite the passage of 60-plus years since departing from Brooklyn, many in the borough, and the nation, continue efforts to encourage a move back east. Many of these efforts take the shape of letter writing campaigns, online petitions and nostalgic articles. Brooklyn Dodgers merchandise is still popular among fans as well. Major League Baseball estimates $9 million in sales every year. The Baseball Hall of Fame reports that Brooklyn photos and broadcasts are the museum's second biggest sellers behind the Yankees, eBay lists close to 1,000 items a day relating to the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the Library of Congress has over 100 books on Brooklyn Dodger teams, third only to the Yankees and Red Sox. There were occasional attempts to move the Dodgers back to Brooklyn. State Senator Thomas J. Bartosiewicz tried hard to persuade them in the early 1980s, but was rebuffed. A stronger chance was in 1998, when the O'Malley family sold up to Rupert Murdoch's Fox company. In the course of bidding, a committee convened by the City and State of New York (including Roger Kahn, author of Boys of Summer) made an offer to the club which was turned down, despite being larger than the eventual sale price. Former Dodger greats adorn the exterior of Dodger Stadium Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle, and it remains one of the most highly regarded stadiums in baseball even today. Despite the fact that the Dodgers have played in Dodger Stadium longer than they had played in Ebbets Field, the stadium remains surprisingly fresh. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense, and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching. Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax The core of the team's success in the 1960s was the dominant pitching tandem of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, who combined to win 4 of the 5 Cy Young Awards from 1962 to 1966, during a time in which only one award was given to the top pitcher from either of the two major leagues. Top pitching also came from Claude Osteen, an aging Johnny Podres, and reliever Ron Perranoski. The hitting attack, on the other hand, was not impressive, and much of the offensive spark came from the exploits of speedy shortstop Maury Wills, who led the league in stolen bases every year from 1960 to 1965, and set a modern record with 104 thefts in 1962. The Dodgers' strategy was once described as follows: \\"Wills hits a single, steals second, and takes third on a grounder. A sacrifice fly brings him home. Koufax or Drysdale pitches a shutout, and the Dodgers win 1‚Äì0.\\" Although few games followed this model exactly, the Dodgers nevertheless tallied a high proportion of wins in a low-scoring manner that relied on their pitching and defense rather than their offense ‚Äì with the exception of a few seasons. For example, in 1962, Tommy Davis led the Major Leagues with 153 RBI, and he led the National League in batting average and in hits. Seasons of over 150 RBI are quite rare by a player in modern-day pro baseball. Davis led the league in batting twice for the Dodgers. The 1962 pennant race ended in a tie, and the Dodgers were defeated by the archrival Giants in the tie-breaking playoff, but the Dodgers proceeded to win the pennant in three of the next four years. The 1963 World Series was a four-game sweep of the Yankees, in which the Dodgers were so dominant that the vaunted Bronx Bombers never even took a lead against Koufax, Podres, and Drysdale. After an injury-plagued 1964, the Dodgers bounced back to win the 1965 World Series in a seven games against the Minnesota Twins. Game one happened to fall on the Yom Kippur holiday, and Koufax (who is Jewish) refused to pitch on that day, a decision for which he was widely praised. The Dodgers rebounded from losing the first two games, with Koufax pitching shutouts in Games five and seven (with only two days rest in between) to win the crown and the World Series MVP Award. The Dodgers again won the pennant in 1966, but the team was running out of gas, and it was swept in the World Series by the upstart Baltimore Orioles. Koufax retired that winter, with his career cut short by arthritis in the elbow of his pitching arm, and Maury Wills was traded away. Don Drysdale continued to be effective, setting a record with six consecutive shutouts in 1968, but he finished with just a 14‚Äì12 record due to the Dodgers' poor hitting that year. While the Dodgers were sub-par for several seasons thereafter, a new core of young talent was developing in their farm system. They won another pennant in 1974, and although they were quickly dismissed by the dynastic Oakland Athletics in the World Series, it was a sign of good things to come. The late 1970s: The early Lasorda years For 23 years, beginning in 1954, the Dodgers had been managed by Walter Alston, a quiet and unflappable man who commanded great respect from his players. Alston's tenure is the third-longest in baseball history for a manager with a single team, after Connie Mack and John McGraw. His retirement near the end of the 1976 season, after winning 7 pennants and 4 World Series titles over his career, cleared the way for an entirely different personality to take the helm of the Dodgers. Tommy Lasorda was a 49-year-old former minor-league pitcher who had been the team's top coach under Alston, and before that had been manager of the Dodgers' top minor league team. He was colorful and gregarious, an enthusiastic cheerleader in contrast to Alston's taciturn demeanor. He quickly became a larger-than-life personality, associating with Frank Sinatra and other celebrities, with a penchant for eating Italian food in large volumes. He became well known for sayings such as, \\"If you cut me, I bleed Dodger blue\\", and for referring to God as \\"the Great Dodger in the sky.\\" Although some considered his persona to be a schtick and found it wearing, his enthusiasm won him a reputation as an \\"ambassador for baseball\\", and it is impossible to think of the Dodgers from the late 1970s to the early 1990s without thinking of Lasorda. Another transition had recently occurred, higher up in the Dodgers management. Walter O'Malley passed control of the team to his son Peter, who would continue to oversee the Dodgers on his family's behalf through 1998. New blood had also been injected into the team on the field. The core of the team was now the infield, composed of Steve Garvey (1B), Davey Lopes (2B), Bill Russell (SS), Ron Cey (3B), and Steve Yeager (C). These five remained in the starting lineup together from 1973 to 1981, longer than any other infield fivesome in baseball history. The pitching staff remained strong, anchored by Don Sutton and Tommy John. The Dodgers won NL West titles in both 1977 and 1978, and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies both years in the National League Championship Series, only to be defeated in the World Series both years by the Yankees. In 1980, they swept a three-game series from the Houston Astros in the final weekend of the regular season (including Don Sutton's brilliant save) and were in a first place tie in the National League West, but lost to the Astros 7‚Äì1 in the one- game playoff. The Dodgers also had a string four consecutive players take home Rookie of the Year awards from 1979 to 1982: Rick Sutcliffe won in 1979, Steve Howe in 1980, Fernando Valenzeula in 1981, and Steve Sax in 1982. The 1980s: Fernandomania and the Bulldog Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 The Dodgers hosted the 1980 All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium for the first time. The Opening Day starting pitcher for 1981 was a 20-year-old rookie from Mexico: Fernando Valenzuela. Pressed into service due to an injury to Jerry Reuss, Valenzuela pitched a shutout that day, and proceeded to win his first 8 decisions through mid-May. The youthful left-hander, speaking only Spanish but sporting a devastating screwball, became a sensation. \\"Fernandomania\\" gripped both Southern California, where huge crowds turned out to see him pitch, as well as in his home country of Mexico, where the number of radio stations that carried Dodger games increased that year from three stations to 17. Valenzuela became the only pitcher ever to be named Rookie of the Year and win the Cy Young Award in the same season. The Dodgers' torrid start assured them of a playoff berth in the strike-shortened split season. After defeating the Montreal Expos with the help of a ninth-inning two-out home run by Rick Monday in the fifth and deciding game of the National League Championship Series they proceeded to defeat the Yankees in the World Series in six games, with the World Series MVP award split three ways among Ron Cey, Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager. The Dodgers won NL West titles in 1983 and 1985, but lost in the NLCS both those years (to the Phillies and Cardinals, respectively). The 1985 NLCS was particularly memorable for Game 6, in which the Dodgers were protecting a 5‚Äì4 lead in the ninth inning, hoping to force a deciding seventh game. With two runners on and first base open, Lasorda elected not to walk Cards slugger Jack Clark, who proceeded to hit a home run off Tom Niedenfuer and send St. Louis to the World Series. After seven years of high strikeout totals, and a 21-win season in 1986, Valenzuela sat out for most of the 1988 season. Plagued by arm troubles that were widely blamed on his being overused by Lasorda, his effectiveness faded before he turned 30. The new anchor of the pitching staff was a right-hander named Orel Hershiser. He had been given the nickname \\"Bulldog\\" by Lasorda, more as a hopeful motivational tool than an objective description of his personality, but by 1988 he had matured into one of baseball's most effective pitchers. That year he won 23 games and the Cy Young Award, and broke Don Drysdale's major league record by tossing 59 consecutive scoreless innings, ending with a 10-inning shutout on his final start of the season. =1988 World Series Championship Team= Orel Hershiser won the Cy Young Award in 1988 and was the World Series MVP The 1988 Championship won by the Dodgers is all the more magical for the fact that the Dodgers were not expected to compete. They enjoyed career years from several players, and were inspired by the fiery intensity of newcomer Kirk Gibson (the league's Most Valuable Player that year), as well as the quiet but steady Hershiser and the always ebullient Lasorda. Although they entered the NLCS as decided underdogs to the powerful New York Mets, against whom they were 1‚Äì10 during the regular season, the Dodgers prevailed in a back-and-forth series that went the entire seven games and saw Hershiser come on for the save in game 4 (preceded by a dramatic 9th-inning home run by Mike Scioscia off Dwight Gooden). The World Series matched them with an even more powerful opponent, the Oakland Athletics, who owned baseball's best regular-season record with 104 wins against only 58 defeats. Featuring the \\"Bash Brothers\\" duo of Mark McGwire and Jos√© Canseco, the A's took an early lead in Game 1 on a grand slam by Canseco, and led 4‚Äì3 going into the bottom of the ninth inning. With two outs, pinch-hitter Mike Davis drew a base on balls from formidable closer Dennis Eckersley. During Davis' at-bat, Lasorda had the light-hitting infielder Dave Anderson on deck so the Athletics would pitch to Davis more carefully. Then, Gibson, hobbled by injuries to both his legs that included a strained MCL and a severely pulled hamstring, came in to pinch hit. After fighting off several pitches and working the count full, Gibson got the backdoor slider he was looking for and pulled it into the right field pavilion for a two-run, walk-off home run, winning the game for the Dodgers, 5‚Äì4. Widely considered one of the most memorable and improbable home runs in baseball history, Gibson's dramatic home run was his only appearance of the entire series, and it set the tone for the following four games. Hershiser dominated the Athletics in Games 2 and 5, and was on the mound when the Dodgers completed their stunning 4 games to 1 upset of the A's, capping off an incredible personal season by being named the Series MVP. They won the Series in Game 5 with lifetime reserves Danny Heep and Mickey Hatcher in the starting lineup. 1990s: Rookies and the Fox era The \\"Think Blue\\" sign, modeled after the famous Hollywood Sign has evolved into one of the team's slogans After 1988, the Dodgers did not win another postseason game until 2004, though they did reach the playoffs in 1995 and 1996, narrowly missed in 1991 and 1997, and led the NL West when the end of the 1994 season was cancelled by a strike. Hershiser, like Valenzuela before him, suffered an arm injury in 1990, and he never regained the production he had earlier in his career. From 1992 to 1996, five consecutive Dodgers were named Rookie of the Year: Eric Karros, Mike Piazza, Ra√∫l Mondes√≠, Hideo Nomo, and Todd Hollandsworth, which is a record. After nearly 20 years at the helm, Lasorda retired in 1996, though he still remained with the Dodgers as an executive vice-president. He was replaced as manager by longtime Dodgers shortstop Bill Russell. Nearly a half- century of unusual stability (only two managers 1954‚Äì1996, owned by a single family 1950‚Äì1998) finally came to an end. After L.A. city officials rejected a proposal to bring an NFL stadium and franchise to Chavez Ravine in 1998, the O'Malley family sold the Dodgers to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, owner of the Fox network (which also owns broadcast rights to MLB games) and 20th Century Fox. Among the new ownership's early moves were trading away popular catcher Piazza, and replacing Russell with veteran manager Davey Johnson. Johnson's volatile tenure ended two years later, and he was followed as manager by Jim Tracy. Fox made the first changes to the home uniform since the club moved from Brooklyn and introduced the team's first alternate jersey and cap, adding silver to the team's official colors (although they have rarely been used since). The team became more steady on the field in the early 2000s, with four consecutive winning seasons under the leadership of manager Tracy, starting pitchers Chan Ho Park and Kevin Brown, slugger Shawn Green, third baseman Adri√°n Beltr√©, and catcher Paul Lo Duca. The 2002 season was marked by the emergence of √âric Gagn√© as one of baseball's top relief pitchers. Gagn√© later won the Cy Young Award in 2003, converting all 55 of his save opportunities that year, and holding the league to a 1.20 ERA and striking out 137 batters in 82‚Öì innings. Gagn√© would later establish a new major league record for consecutive saves, with 84 saves spanning parts of the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons.  The McCourts and the Sabermetric experiment  In 2004, the Dodgers were returned to family ownership, as News Corp sold the team to Boston real estate developer Frank McCourt. McCourt immediately hired Paul DePodesta as his new general manager, replacing Dan Evans. As an assistant general manager in Oakland under Billy Beane, DePodesta favored a highly statistical approach to evaluating prospects and potential free-agents. This sabermetric approach, widely publicized in the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis, led many to believe that new owner McCourt was unwilling to pay for high priced talent, and would thus reduce the Dodgers to a status similar to small-market teams such as Oakland. With a team largely assembled by DePodesta's predecessors, and augmented by some acquisitions of his own, DePodesta saw the Dodgers near the top of the standings through much of 2004. In an effort to put the team over the top that year, DePodesta pulled off a number of mid-season trades, including sending away three key players (including popular team leader LoDuca), while obtaining several new players. The Dodgers did manage to win the NL West in 2004, but bowed out quickly in four games in the Division Series to the eventual National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. During the winter of 2004‚Äì05, the team parted ways with several more longtime players, including Beltr√© and Green. Their replacements included starting pitcher Derek Lowe, outfielder J. D. Drew, and the run-producing, but aging second baseman Jeff Kent. DePodesta's radical overhaul did not bear fruit in 2005, as the Dodgers suffered from clubhouse strife and stifling injuries, finishing with their second-worst record in Los Angeles history. The club also faced an overwhelming number of injuries that quickly scuttled the team's hopes of repeating as division champions. Among them were Drew's broken wrist, All-Star shortstop C√©sar Izturis's injury that required Tommy John surgery, and closer Gagn√©'s deteriorating elbow condition that would also require surgery and force him to miss much of the 2005 season. Manager Jim Tracy also parted ways with the team at the end of the 2005 season, citing irreconcilable differences with DePodesta. However, DePodesta himself was fired by McCourt less than a month later, with McCourt later citing DePodesta's lack of leadership and dissatisfaction over DePodesta's handling of the process of hiring a new manager. Ned Colletti was hired as the new Dodger GM on November 16, 2005. Colletti and Little Newly hired Colletti was responsible for a tangible change in attitude and guided the Dodgers' resurgence in the 2006 season. He hired former Red Sox manager Grady Little to lead the team and also traded oft-troubled Milton Bradley for Oakland Athletics prospect Andre Ethier. His off season acquisitions also included former Atlanta Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal and former Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller. Coletti also signed former All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, even though the team already had two other former All-Star shortstops (Furcal and the then-injured C√©sar Izturis). Garciaparra agreed to play first base and adjusted quite well in the field and remained productive at the plate, producing several key hits in Dodger victories. New Dodger general manager Ned Colletti Due to the crowded infield, untimely injuries and several players' lack of production, the team was rebuilt during the season. The flurry of trading saw C√©sar Izturis go to the Chicago Cubs for Greg Maddux while Willy Aybar and Danys B√°ez went to Atlanta for Wilson Betemit. A series of rookies were called up and provided substantial everyday contributions. Among them were catcher Russell Martin, who won the starting catching job after being called up in May and starting pitcher Chad Billingsley, who had several quality starts in August and September. Andre Ethier led the team in batting with a .308 batting average as the team's everyday left fielder through much of the season. Rookie first baseman James Loney hit very well in his short time with the team, tying Gil Hodges‚Äô 56-year-old Dodgers record with 9 RBI in one game on September 28. Another key move was handing the closer's role to rookie (but Japanese League veteran) Takashi Saito, where he flourished, notching 24 saves in 26 opportunities while posting a 2.07 ERA. After a heated pennant race, in which the most memorable moment occurred when the Dodgers hit four consecutive home runs on September 18 to tie the score in the ninth inning and then won the game on a tenth-inning walk-off homer by Nomar Garciaparra, the Dodgers entered the 2006 playoffs in the National League's Wild Card spot, having tied the San Diego Padres for the division lead but having lost 13 of 18 head-to- head meetings with the Padres. They were eventually swept, 3‚Äì0, by the New York Mets in the 2006 National League Division Series. In 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers sent three players (Brad Penny, Takashi Saito, and Russell Martin) to the all-star game, and at one point, the Dodgers had a record of 54‚Äì41, which was then the best record in the National League. After a hitting slump, the Dodgers fell to 60‚Äì59, and seven games out of first place in the N.L. West. The Dodgers were able to rebound, however, and had a 79‚Äì69 record with three weeks left in the season. At this point, the Dodgers trailed the San Diego Padres by 1¬Ω games in the wild card slot, and the Arizona Diamondbacks by 3¬Ω games. However, the Dodgers lost 10 of their next 11 games, which eliminated the Dodgers from post season play, and would finish the season with a disappointing 82‚Äì80 record. The last few weeks of the season were disrupted further by public complaints in the media by some of the veteran ballplayers about the lack of respect afforded them by some of the younger players on the team. This led to a divided clubhouse, as younger players consistently got more playing time at the expense of the veterans. After the season and weeks of media speculation, Grady Little resigned as manager, citing personal reasons . A few days later the Dodgers announced the hiring of former New York Yankees skipper Joe Torre to be the team's new manager. Mannywood A \\"Mannywood\\" banner in Downtown Los Angeles. At the start of the 2008 season, Joe Torre found himself with a whole new team, including new players Andruw Jones and Japanese pitcher Hiroki Kuroda. To add to his troubles, Don Mattingly was unable to perform his hitting coach duties, and third basemen Nomar Garciaparra and Andy LaRoche were out with injuries, leaving the starting third base position to rookie Blake DeWitt, who had never played above level A ball in the minor leagues. DeWitt stepped up early, when Nomar went down again with a calf injury. The team suffered a serious blow when star player Rafael Furcal was injured in the midst of the best start of his career. Many substitutions were used, including rookies Chin-Lung Hu and Luis Maza, but could not duplicate Furcal's offense. Staff ace Brad Penny and slugger Jones began to underperform, leading to trips to the DL for both. Despite the problems with the roster, as well as their record, the Dodgers were only behind first-place Arizona by one game at the All-Star break. The season saw progress in the teams prospects, including a call-up for top prospect Clayton Kershaw, as well as comebacks from veteran pitchers, most notably Chan Ho Park. Chad Billingsley quickly grew to be the team's ace, being one of the leaders in strikeouts and ERA and being the first pitcher on the Dodgers to get double-digit wins. For the majority of the season, the club hovered around a .500 record. To bolster a lineup of mostly young players, Ned Colletti made trades for shortstop √Ångel Berroa, third-baseman Casey Blake, and on July 31, 2008 the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired outfielder Manny Ramirez from the Boston Red Sox in a 3-way deal that sent third baseman Andy LaRoche and single-A prospect pitcher Bryan Morris to the Pittsburgh Pirates and all- star outfielder Jason Bay to the Red Sox. Ramirez brought an energy to the team that it had lacked previously and also energized the fanbase. After playing more than 140 games of catch-up, the Dodgers swept Arizona to take first place in the last series of the season for the two teams on September 7 after being 4 games behind the week before. The Dodgers clinched the 2008 National League Western Division title on September 25 as the Arizona Diamondbacks were eliminated by losing to the St. Louis Cardinals 12‚Äì3. On October 4, 2008 they beat the Cubs 3‚Äì0 to sweep the 2008 NLDS and moved on to the NLCS, where they faced the Philadelphia Phillies and were eliminated, losing the series in five games. In 2009, however, Manny was suspended for taking a performing-enhancing substance. Despite the 50-game suspension, the Dodgers repeated as National League West Champions and once again faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Championship Series [NLCS] after sweeping [3‚Äì0] the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series [NLDS]. They once more lost to Philadelphia [1‚Äì4]. The following season, a procession of injuries caused the Dodgers to fall out of the race by late summer. Manny Ramirez was traded to the Chicago White Sox in August and in September Joe Torre announced his decision to retire as Dodgers manager, to be replaced by Don Mattingly. Divorce, scandal, bankruptcy and the end of the McCourt era Frank McCourt On October 14, 2009, it was announced the McCourts would be separating after nearly 30 years of marriage. While speculation was raised on the impact upon the McCourt family Dodger ownership, a spokesperson for Jamie McCourt said the following day that \\"the focus of the Dodgers is on the playoffs and the World Series\\". Jamie was fired from her position as Dodgers CEO on Thursday, October 22, 2009, the day after the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs, thus ending the reign of the self- proclaimed \\"First Female CEO of a Baseball Team.\\" She officially filed for divorce shortly thereafter. Frank claimed that the divorce would have \\"no bearing on the team whatsoever\\". \\" Despite that assertion, media speculation continued that the team was in financial difficulty. On March 31, 2011, after the Opening Day game against the San Francisco Giants, a Giants fan was attacked by two men wearing Dodgers attire in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. He suffered serious injuries and was diagnosed with brain damage. In response, the Dodgers and Giants held a joint fundraiser to benefit the victim, a reward was offered for the capture of the attackers and security was beefed up at the stadium. On April 20, Baseball commissioner Bud Selig announced that MLB would be appointing a representative to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. His statement said that he took that action because of his \\"deep concerns for the finances and operations\\" of the Dodgers.Bud Selig says MLB will run Dodgers On June 27, one week after the commissioner refused to approve a proposed television contract that would have pumped much needed funding into the club, the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Dodgers file for bankruptcy After much legal wrangling between McCourts lawyers and MLB lawyers in bankruptcy court, he reached a deal with the league to put the team up for sale.Frank McCourt agrees to sell Dodgers On March 27, 2012, it was announced that an agreement had been reached on the sale of the Dodgers between Frank McCourt and Guggenheim Baseball Management LLC, a group of investors fronted by Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter and including former Los Angeles Lakers player Magic Johnson, baseball executive Stan Kasten and film mogul Peter Guber. The total sale price for the Dodgers (which includes Dodger Stadium) exceeded $2 billion, making the sale the largest for a professional sports team in history, exceeding the approximately $1.5 billion purchase of Manchester United F.C. by Malcolm Glazer in 2005, On the same day, it was also announced that the members of the group will partner McCourt in purchasing the property surrounding the stadium. The sale price of the Dodgers was considered to be far higher than what the team was actually worth at the time of sale. Estimates made by Forbes placed the value of the Dodgers at approximately $1.4 billion, and the winning bid was more than 30% higher than the next highest bid. On April 13, the sale was approved by the bankruptcy court and it officially closed on May 1, 2012.Dodgers sale closes; McCourt era ends Guggenheim takes over and Free spending The Guggenheim group didn't waste any time upgrading the team's roster. In a departure from the McCourt years, the Dodgers started acquiring big contracts in trades. They traded for third baseman/shortstop Hanley Ram√≠rez from the Miami Marlins, outfielder Shane Victorino from the Philadelphia Phillies and, in what was described as the \\"biggest August trade in MLB history\\" Adri√°n Gonz√°lez, Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford from the Boston Red Sox.Blockbuster deal for Dodgers, Red Sox will be defined by dollars and sense In their first season of ownership, the Dodgers new owners added $431 million in salary commitments.Dodgers payroll for 2013 already $100 million more than this season Despite the efforts, the Dodgers missed the playoffs for the third straight year. In the offseason the Dodgers went out and signed free agent starter Zack Greinke and Korean pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu to bolster their rotation. However, injuries to star players including Greinke, Ram√≠rez and Matt Kemp got the team off to a slow start in 2013. On June 21 they were in last place in the division, games behind the first place Arizona Diamondbacks. They turned things around in a hurry as players got healthy, made Kenley Jansen the closer, and Cuban defector Yasiel Puig joined the roster. The team went on a 46‚Äì10 run from June 22 through August 23 and moved past all the other teams in their division. On September 19 they clinched the division title, the earliest the team had ever clinched. The deficit they overcame was the largest in franchise history and they were just the fourth team in MLB history to win the division after being in last place on July 1. The team advanced to the 2013 National League Championship Series but lost in six games to the St. Louis Cardinals. The 2014 season saw the emergence of Dee Gordon who took over the starting second base job and led the league in triples and stolen bases. Matt Kemp also returned to form after two seasons of batting injuries and Adri√°n Gonz√°lez led the league in RBI. The pitching staff featured another dominant performance by Clayton Kershaw, who was 21‚Äì3 with a 1.77 ERA. He was the first pitcher in history to lead the league in ERA four straight seasons. Kershaw and Josh Beckett both pitched no-hitters during the season and the Dodgers had four pitchers (Kershaw, Greinke, Ryu and Dan Haren) all win 13 or more games. The Dodgers won their second straight NL West championship but lost again to the Cardinals in the Division Series. Kershaw would win the NL Cy Young Award and the NL MVP Award, making him the first National League player to win both awards in the same season since Bob Gibson in 1968. In 2015, journalist Molly Knight published a book named 'Best Team Money Can Buy', chronicling the team's 2012, 2013, and 2014 seasons. The book goes inside-the-clubhouse story of tumultuous years when the team was re-made from top to bottom, becoming the most talked-about and colorful teams in baseball. Roberts and Friedman era and return to the World Series Following the disappointing end of the 2014 season, the Dodgers entered their 2015 season by replacing general manager Ned Colletti and hiring Andrew Friedman, (formerly of the Tampa Bay Rays) to the newly created post of \\"President of Baseball Operations\\" with a mandate to rebuild the farm system so that the team could build from within instead of continuing to pursue costly free agents. The new front office, which included hiring new general manager Farhan Zaidi, Farm Director Gabe Kapler, Vice President of Baseball Operations Josh Byrnes, Director of Player Personnel Galen Carr, and Director of Amateur Scouting Billy Gasparino made several trades that first off-season and drastically reshaped the roster and farm system. They traded away Matt Kemp, Dee Gordon, Dan Haren and others in moves that brought in established veterans like Howie Kendrick, Jimmy Rollins and young players with potential such as Yasmani Grandal, Austin Barnes, Enrique Hernandez, and Alex Wood. At the minor league level, they put more emphasis on statcast data rather than traditional statistics, hired at least one Spanish-speaking coach to every minor league staff and introduced organic foods to players. The team battled injuries in 2015 that removed two members of the projected starting rotation to early season ending injuries and Puig also spent much of the season injured. Rookies Joc Pederson and Corey Seager came up and showed potential and Kershaw and Greinke remained the best one-two punch starting pitchers in the league. The Dodgers won their third straight NL West title for the first time in franchise history but again flamed out in the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Mets. Following the 2015 season, the club parted ways with manager Don Mattingly and Greinke exercised an opt-out clause in his contract, going on to sign with division rival Arizona. The club replaced Mattingly with San Diego coach and former Dodgers player Dave Roberts to be the team's new manager for the 2016 season and added former Toronto Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos to their front office. The team battled injuries in 2016, setting a new MLB record for the most players to spend time on the disabled list in one season. The team signed Japanese pitcher Kenta Maeda in the off-season and acquired Rich Hill at the trading deadline, helping them makeup for the loss of Kershaw for two months with a back injury. They won the NL West for the fourth straight season and defeated the Washington Nationals in the Division Series before losing in the NLCS to the eventual World Series champion Cubs. Corey Seager won the National League Rookie of The Year award. =2017 World Series= Following the 2016 season, the Dodgers re-signed free agents Justin Turner, Kenley Jansen, and Rich Hill. During the season, the Dodgers received surprise performances from utility man Chris Taylor and relief pitcher Brandon Morrow and rookie first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, all three whom started the season in the minor leagues. At the trade deadline, they traded for established ace Yu Darvish and also added left-handed relievers Tony Watson and Tony Cingrani. The team raced off to a 91‚Äì36 record through August 25, where many wondered if this was one of the best teams in MLB history. However, a late season slump, in which the team lost 20 of 25 games (highlighted by 11 straight losses), led to questions about whether the Dodgers would succeed in the postseason. Despite the slump, the team recovered to win eight of its final ten regular season games, securing their fifth consecutive National League West title and home field advantage throughout the MLB playoffs. In the postseason, the Dodgers swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Division Series and defeated the defending World Series champion Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series in five games to advance to the World Series against the Houston Astros. The Dodgers lost the series in seven games. Bellinger would be honored as the National League's Rookie of the Year for 2017, marking the third time the Dodgers had their players take home back-to- back Rookie of the Year honors in their history. In January 2020, MLB confirmed that the Astros engaged in an elaborate and illegal sign stealing system during the 2017 regular season and postseason, during which they beat the Dodgers in the World Series. =2018 World Series= Despite a 16‚Äì26 start to the season, which saw the team lose shortstop Corey Seager for the year, the 2018 Dodgers made the playoffs for the 6th straight year; winning the division in a Game 163 over the Rockies. Like the 2017 team, the 2018 version saw the Dodgers receive surprise contributions from unlikely sources. Max Muncy, who signed as a minor league free agent in the middle of the 2017 season and who was not on the opening day roster, ended up hitting a team leading 35 home runs between playing time at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Matt Kemp, traded back to the Dodgers in the off-season in part of a salary dump, led the team in RBIs and batting average. Rookie starting pitcher Walker Buehler, who was also not on the opening day roster, helped solidify the rotation by posting a 2.62 ERA in 24 appearances (23 starts). He, along with three other pitchers, threw a combined no-hitter on May 5 against the San Diego Padres. At the July trade deadline, the team traded for All-Star shortstop/third baseman Manny Machado and a former All-Star second baseman Brian Dozier. In August, former World Series MVP David Freese was brought in from Pittsburgh to strength an already formidable line-up. For the 2nd year in a row, the team broke the record for most home runs in a season by a Dodger team. With a 92‚Äì71 record, the team entered the playoffs as a second seed and went on to beat the Atlanta Braves, led by former Dodgers executive Alex Anthopoulos, in four games in the NLDS and the Milwaukee Brewers in a hard-fought seven games in the NLCS. The Dodgers were the first team in either league to win Game 7 of an LCS on the road since the 2006 Cardinals. The Dodgers again came up short in the World Series, this time losing to the Boston Red Sox in five games. =2019: 7th straight NL West= In the 2018-2019 off-season, the Dodgers lost GM Farhan Zaidi, who took the president of baseball operations job for the San Francisco Giants, while third base coach Chris Woodward was hired to manage the Texas Rangers. This marked the second straight year Los Angeles lost a significant member of the front office and coaching staff. Jeff Kingston was hired from Seattle as Assistant GM to replace Zaidi. Long time fan favorite Yasiel Puig was traded along with Matt Kemp, Kyle Farmer, Alex Wood and Homer Bailey for prospects Jeter Downs and Josiah Gray, to open up playing time for younger players such as Alex Verdugo, Will Smith and Julio Urias, and also to reduce payroll to avoid MLB's competitive balance tax. Following a July 3, 2019 walk-off home run from Cody Bellinger, the Dodgers set a franchise and major league record for most consecutive walk-offs with 5. A few weeks earlier, they also became the first team to have three consecutive walk-offs from rookies - Matt Beaty, Alex Verdugo and Will Smith. For the third straight year they broke the Dodgers record for home runs in a season. Additionally, on September 4, they broke the National League record for most home runs in a season with 250th homer (breaking the old mark set by the 2000 Houston Astros). For the second straight season, Los Angeles led the NL in runs scored and lowest runs allowed. The Dodgers clinched the NL West for the 7th consecutive season on September 10 on the road against the Baltimore Orioles. It was the earliest the Dodgers had ever clinched a division in team history. They finished the regular season with a record of 106‚Äì56, breaking the franchise records for wins in a season, previously held by the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers. However they suffered an upset loss to the Washington Nationals in the 2019 NLDS. =2020 season: Mookie Betts, COVID-19, shortened season= On February 10, 2020, the Dodgers traded outfielder Alex Verdugo and minor leaguers Connor Wong and Jeter Downs to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for outfielder Mookie Betts, starting pitcher David Price and cash considerations. They also traded starting pitcher Kenta Maeda, minor leaguer Ja√≠r Camargo and cash considerations to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher Brusdar Graterol, outfielder Luke Raley and the 67th pick in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft. On July 22, the Dodgers signed Mookie Betts to a 12-year contract extension, through the 2032 season. The deal was worth $365 million and also included a $65 million signing bonus, making it the richest contract in Dodgers history. On March 12, 2020, MLB announced that because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks in addition to the remainder of spring training being cancelled. Four days later, it was announced that the start of the season would be pushed back indefinitely due to the recommendation made by the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for eight weeks. On June 23, commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps on July 1 in order to resume spring training and prepare for a July 23 Opening Day. On July 4, newly acquired David Price announced he would opt out of playing in the 2020 season due to the pandemic. The 2020 Dodgers started the season 30‚Äì10, matching the best 40-game start in franchise history. The last such Dodgers start came in 1977, along with the Brooklyn teams in 1888 and 1955. This was also the best 40-game start in the majors since the 116-win Mariners began 31‚Äì9 in 2001. The Dodgers finished the regular season 43-17 and won their 8th straight division title.

He founded Aitchison College, Lahore in 1886. He served as Chief Commissioner of the British Crown Colony of Burma from March 1878 to May 1880. Aitchison was born in Edinburgh. Biography Education Charles Umpherston Aitchison, born in Edinburgh on 20 May 1832, was the son of Hugh Aitchison of that city, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Umpherston of Loanhead near Edinburgh. He was educated at the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he took the degree of M.A. on 23 April 1853. While a university student, Aitchison attended the lectures of Sir William Hamilton on logic and metaphysics. He afterwards passed some time in Germany, where he studied the works of Fichte, and attended the lectures of Tholuck at the University of Halle. Indian civil service In 1855 he ranked fifth at the first competitive examination for the Indian Civil Service, and after spending a year in England in the study of law and oriental languages he landed at Kolkata (then Calcutta) on 26 September 1856. In March 1857 he was appointed an assistant in Hiss√°r, then a district of the North-Western Provinces and in the following month was transferred to the Punjab, where he joined shortly after the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Owing to this transfer he escaped a massacre of Europeans which took place at Hiss√°r on 29 May. His first station in his new province was Amritsar, and immediately after his arrival there he was employed under the orders of the deputy commissioner in carrying out the measures which were taken to prevent the Jalandhar mutineers from crossing the Beas River. Shortly afterwards he was appointed personal assistant to the judicial commissioner, in which capacity he compiled A Manual of the Criminal Law of the Panj√°b (1860). While thus employed, he was much thrown with Sir John Laird Mair Lawrence (afterwards Baron Lawrence), with whose policy, especially on the Central Asian question, and on British relations with Afghanistan, he was strongly imbued during the remainder of his life. In 1892 he contributed a memoir of Lord Lawrence to Sir William Wilson Hunter's Rulers of India series. In 1859 he joined the secretariat of the government of India as under-secretary in the political department, and served there until 1865, when, at the instance of Sir John Lawrence, then governor- general, in order that he might acquire administrative experience, he took up administrative work in the Punjab, serving first as a deputy-commissioner and subsequently officiating as commissioner of Lahore. In 1868 he rejoined the secretariat as foreign secretary, and retained that appointment until 1878. As secretary Aitchison was extremely industrious and thorough in his work. He exercised a marked influence on successive governors-general, who regarded him as a wise and trusted adviser. During the earlier part of his service in the Indian foreign office he commenced the compilation of a valuable work entitled A Collection of Treaties, Engagements, and Sanads relating to India and neighbouring Countries; the first volume appeared at Calcutta in 1862, and eleven volumes were issued by 1892; each treaty is prefaced by a clear historical narrative. In 1875, he published a treatise on The Native States of India, with the leading cases illustrating the principles which underlie their relations with the British government. A staunch believer in the policy of masterly inactivity, he regarded with grave apprehension the measures which, carried out under the government of Lord Lytton, culminated in the Afghan war of 1878‚Äì9. British Burma Before the war broke out in 1878 he accepted the appointment of chief commissioner of British Burma. When holding that office he raised two questions of considerable importance. The first was the question of the opium trade as bearing upon Burma. The second had reference to the relations of certain English public servants with the women of the country. Neither of these questions was dealt with officially by Lytton's government; but with reference to the second the viceroy intimated semi- officially that he disapproved of a circular which Aitchison had issued, as mixing up morals with politics. After Aitchison's departure from the province both these questions were taken up by his successor, who received the support of Lord Ripon's government in dealing with them. The number of licensed opium shops was then reduced to one-third of those previously licensed, and the consumption of licit opium was reduced by two-fifths, involving a loss of revenue of four lakhs (400,000) of rupees. On the other question, the principle of Aitchison's circular, stopping the promotion of officers who continued the practice which he had denounced, was enforced. The Punjab In 1881 Aitchison left Burma, to become on 4 April 1882, lieutenant-governor of the Punjab. His government there was very successful, and ‚Äî according to the Dictionary of National Biography - popular with all classes of the people. Amongst his major achievements in the field of public education, at this time, were the establishment of the Aitchison College and the University of the Punjab, both at Lahore. He was a staunch advocate of the policy of advancing indigenous Indians in the public service as they proved their fitness for higher posts and for more responsible duties. On this point, in connection with what is known as the Ilbert Bill, he advocated measures even more liberal than those proposed by Lord Ripon's government. He had intended to leave India for good when his lieutenant-governorship came to an end in 1887, but being invited by Lord Dufferin to join the council of the governor-general and give the viceroy the benefit of his experience on the many questions which had to be dealt with consequent upon the annexation of Upper Burma, he returned to India for another nineteen months. During the latter part of his government of the Punjab he had discharged the additional duty of presiding over the public service commission, and this duty he continued to perform after joining the governor-general's council. He gave unremitting attention to this work, and by his influence over the somewhat heterogeneous body of which the commission was composed he induced them to present a unanimous report. He retired and finally left India in November 1888. Early in the following year he settled in London, but subsequently moved to Oxford. In 1881 he was nominated Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India, and in 1882 Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire. He received the degree of LL.D. from the university of Edinburgh on 24 February 1877, and that of honorary M.A. from Oxford University in 1895. Personal life Aitchison, a religious man, was a supporter of Christian missions while in India, and after his retirement was an active member of the committee of the Church Missionary Society. He died at Oxford on 18 February 1896. Aitchison married, on 2 February 1863, Beatrice Lyell, one of four daughters of James Cox (1808‚Äì1875), D.L., of Clement Park, Forfarshire, who was the senior partner of Cox Brothers and Co, owners of Camperdown Works in Lochee, Dundee. Their daughter Beatrice Clementia married British Indian Army official James Dunlop Smith.

Precise figures on unionization in the late 1980s were practically nonexistent, even within the unions themselves. The organized labor movement in Ecuador was divided into four confederations and a number of independent federations. At the local level, labor organizations also took the form of artisan guilds, cooperatives, and neighborhood associations. In addition to representing only a minority of the workers in all sectors of employment (approximately one-fifth), the labor movement traditionally was weakened by rivalry and government repression. Nevertheless, it had influence disproportionate to its numbers as a result of the concentration of trade unions in urban areas, mainly Quito and Guayaquil, its organizational power, and the political impact of strikes and demonstrations on governments that did not enjoy strong support. Professional or employee associations (c√°maras), composed of middle-class, white-collar workers, constituted about 25 percent of all trade unions. Representing the dominant economic groups in the country, these associations exercised a predominant influence on economic policy; their representatives frequently held cabinet posts and other top government positions dealing with economics. The support of the associations proved crucial to most governments. History Although union organizations began forming in Ecuador early in the twentieth century, organized workers did not begin to acquire any influence until the late 1930s. Key events in Ecuador's labor history took place in 1938 with the promulgation of the Labor Code and the founding of the first labor confederation, the Ecuadorian Federation of Classist Organizations (Central Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones Clasistas, or Cedoc). Between 1938 and 1949, some 550 labor organizations were formed. These included the country's second confederation, the Confederation of Ecuadorian Workers (Confederaci√≥n de Trabajadores Ecuatorianos, CTE), which began operating in 1944. A total of 3,093 unions were established between 1950 and 1973. Cedoc was never an effective articulator of worker interests, being more concerned with religious causes, combating efforts to eliminate exclusion of ecclesiastical control and influence in labor organizations, and curtailing communist infiltration in the labor sector. Although of Catholic origin, Cedoc rejected its Christian Democratic leadership in 1976 and adopted a socialist orientation. The old leaders retained the support of a few grassroots organizations and formed a parallel organization. Approximately 80 percent of Cedoc's membership came from the Ecuadorian Federation of Peasant Organizations (Federaci√≥n Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones Campesinas, or Fenoc). In the mid-1980s, Cedoc had unions in fifteen of the twenty provinces; its estimated membership of 130,000 was largely composed of artisans, with almost no industrial worker membership. After twelve years of political division, the two Cedoc branches united in 1988 and formed the Ecuadorian Confederation of Classist Organizations for Workers' Unity (Confederaci√≥n Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones Clasistas para la Unidad de los Trabajadores, CEDOCUT). Through militant activities, such as petitions, collective conflicts, and general strikes, the CTE‚Äîcomposed predominantly of industrial workers and led by members of the communist and socialist parties‚Äîemerged as the principal labor organization in Ecuador in the late 1970s. Although the CTE had become the largest of the three national confederations by the 1970s, its hegemony declined in the 1980s as a result of the growth of rival confederations, internal conflicts and splits, and governmental repression. In 1987 only a shadow remained of its peasant federation, the Ecuadorian Indian Federation (Federaci√≥n Ecuatoriana de Indios, FEI). The CTE still included a number of industrial unions and various public-sector unions, and was organizing autonomous workers. It encompassed an estimated 55,000 members in 200 affiliated unions. The Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador established a small federation, the General Union of Ecuadorian Workers (Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores Ecuatorianos, UGTE), in an attempt to rival the CTE. Apart from the powerful National Union of Teachers (Uni√≥n Nacional de Educadores, UNE), which had about 100,000 members, the UGTE had little success in affiliating unions. Together with student unions and a few other groups, the UGTE formed the Popular Front (Frente Popular, FP), which in the 1980s was attempting to rival the United Workers Front (Frente Unitario de Trabajadores, FUT) in organizing protest action. The Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (Organizaci√≥n Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores, ORIT) tried to unify the non-Marxist unions by founding the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organizations (Confederaci√≥n Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones Sindicales Libres, CEOSL) in 1962. CEOSL, the third-largest confederation, membership consisted almost exclusively of urban white- and blue-collar workers. The CEOSL included fourteen provincial and thirteen national federations made up of a large proportion of industrial workers, a number of members from the service sector, and a small number of agricultural workers, peasants, and craftsmen. FUT emerged in 1971 and eventually united the three main confederations‚ÄîCedoc, CEOSL, and CTE‚Äîplus a number of independent unions, including the Catholic Federation of Workers (Central Cat√≥lica de Obreros, CCO), making FUT the country's largest workers' confederation. By the 1980s, FUT totaled an estimated 300,000 members and emerged as the leader of a massive movement that arose spontaneously to protest the economic crisis, and that greatly outnumbered the ranks of unionized workers. FUT nearly toppled President Osvaldo Hurtado in 1982 when he introduced austerity measures in the face of the debt crisis. In June 1988, FUT, together with the National Coordinator of Workers (Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores, CNT), the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Confederaci√≥n de Nacionalidades Ind√≠genas del Ecuador, or Conaie), and FP, staged a one-day national strike aimed at obtaining a large increase in the minimum wage and a freeze on the prices of basic goods. It was the seventh general labor action against the Febres Cordero government and coincided with an ongoing strike by the UNE for a rise in monthly wages. The impact of FUT remained limited, however, because the federation tended to maintain its working-class orientation, based on wage claims, and in practice gave relatively little importance to the claims of other sectors that looked to it for leadership.

The team moved west at the same time as its longtime rivals, the New York Giants, also in the National League, relocated to San Francisco in northern California as the San Francisco Giants. The team's name derived from the reputed skill of Brooklyn residents at evading the city's trolley streetcar network. The Dodgers played in two stadiums in South Brooklyn, each named Washington Park, and at Eastern Park in the neighborhood of Brownsville before moving to Ebbets Field in the neighborhood of Flatbush in 1913. The team is noted for signing Jackie Robinson in 1947 as the first black player in the modern major leagues.Jackson, Kenneth T. (2010).The Encyclopedia of New York City, Second Edition pp. 176‚Äì77 Early Brooklyn baseball Many of the clubs represented at the first convention of the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) were from Brooklyn, including the Atlantic, Eckford, and Excelsior clubs that combined to dominate play for most of the 1860s. Brooklyn helped make baseball commercial, as the locale of the first paid admission games, a series of three all star contests matching New York and Brooklyn in 1858. Brooklyn also featured the first two enclosed baseball grounds, the Union Grounds and the Capitoline Grounds; enclosed, dedicated ballparks accelerated the evolution from amateurism to professionalism. Despite the early success of Brooklyn clubs in the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP), which were officially amateur until 1869, they fielded weak teams in the succeeding National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), the first professional league formed in 1871. The Excelsiors no longer challenged for the amateur championship after the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) and never entered the professional NAPBBP (aka NA). The Eckfords and Atlantics declined to join until 1872 and thereby lost their best players; the Eckfords survived only one season and the Atlantics four, with losing teams. The National League (NL) replaced the NAPBBP in 1876 and granted exclusive territories to its eight members, excluding the Atlantics in favor of the Mutual Club of New York who had shared home grounds with the Atlantics. When the Mutuals were expelled by the league, the Hartford club moved in, the press dubbing them The Brooklyn Hartfords, and played its home games at Union Grounds in 1877 before disbanding. The origin of the Dodgers The team currently known as the Dodgers was formed in 1883 by real estate magnate and baseball enthusiast Charles Byrne, who convinced his brother-in-law Joseph Doyle and casino operator Ferdinand Abell to start the team with him. Byrne arranged to build a grandstand on a lot bounded by Third Street, Fourth Avenue, Fifth Street, and Fifth Avenue, and named it Washington Park in honor of first president George Washington. Nicknamed by reporters the \\"Grays\\" for their uniforms, the team played in the minor level Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs that first season. Doyle became the first team manager, and they drew 6,431 fans to their first home game on May 12, 1883 against the Trenton, New Jersey team. The Grays won the league title after the Camden Merritt club in New Jersey disbanded on July 20 and Brooklyn picked up some of its better players. The Grays were invited to join the two year old professional circuit, the American Association (founded 1882) to compete with the eight year old NL for the 1884 season. After winning the American Association league championship in 1889, the Brooklyn club (very occasionally now nicknamed the Bridegrooms or Grooms, for six players having wed during the 1888 season) moved to the competing older National League (1876) and won the 1890 NL Championship, being the only Major League team to win consecutive championships in both professional \\"base ball\\" leagues. They lost the 1889 championship tournament to the New York Giants and tied the 1890 championship with Louisville. Their success during this period was partly attributed to their having absorbed skilled players from the defunct AA New York Metropolitans and one-year Players League entry Brooklyn Ward's Wonders. The middle years of the decade were disappointing, a slump the Spalding Guide rather primly ascribed to management tolerating drunkenness among the players.Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide 1894. Chicago: A. G. Spalding and Bortothers 1894, p. 26 In 1899, most of the original old Baltimore Orioles NL stars from the legendary Maryland club which earlier won three consecutive championships in 1894‚Äì1895‚Äì1896, were moved to the Grays (Bridegrooms) by the ownership partner in both teams, Harry Von der Horst, along with famed Orioles manager Ned Hanlon who became the club's new manager in New York / Brooklyn under majority owner Charles Ebbets, who had by now accumulated an 80% share of the club. The new combined team was dubbed the Brooklyn Superbas by the press (inspired by the popular circus act The Hanlons' Superba) and would become the champions of the National League in 1899 and again in 1900. Nicknames Logo of the Brooklyn Dodgers/Superbas from 1910 through 1913 The name Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers was first used to describe the team in 1895. The nickname was still new enough in September 1895 that a newspaper could report that \\"'Trolley Dodgers' is the new name which eastern baseball cranks [fans] have given the Brooklyn club.\\" In 1895, Brooklyn played at Eastern Park, bounded by Eastern Parkway (now Pitkin Avenue), Powell Street, Sutter Avenue, Van Sinderen Street, where they had moved early in the 1891 season when the second Washington Park burned down. Some sources erroneously report that the name \\"Trolley Dodgers\\" referred to pedestrians avoiding fast cars on street car tracks that bordered Eastern Park on two sides. However, Eastern Park was not bordered by street-level trolley lines that had to be \\"dodged\\" by pedestrians. The name \\"Trolley Dodgers\\" implied the dangers posed by trolley cars in Brooklyn generally, which in 1892, began the switch from horse-power to electrical power, which made them much faster, and were hence regarded as more dangerous.Other sources report that \\"trolley dodgers\\" was a mocking term used of Brooklynites by residents of Manhattan, whose trolleys had mostly been replaced by underground subways. The name was later shortened to Brooklyn Dodgers.. Other team names used to refer to the franchise that finally came to be called \\"the Dodgers\\" were the Atlantics (1884, not directly related to the earlier Brooklyn Atlantics), Bridegrooms or Grooms (1888‚Äì1898), Ward's Wonders, the Superbas (1899-1910), and the Robins (1914‚Äì1931). All of these nicknames were used by fans and newspaper sports writers to describe the team, often concurrently, but not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club. However, the \\"Trolley Dodgers\\" nickname was used throughout this period, along with other nicknames, by fans and sports writers of the day. The team did not use the name in a formal sense until 1916, when the name was printed on home World Series programs; the word \\"Dodgers\\" finally appeared on team jerseys in 1932. The \\"conclusive shift\\" came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name \\"Dodgers\\". Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used interchangeably are available from newspaper articles from the period before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game the Dodgers played in 1916 starts out by referring to how \\"Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant\\", but then goes on to comment, \\"the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played.\\" Most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins; on the other hand, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle used \\"Superbas\\" in its box scores that season. A 1918 New York Times article used the nickname Robins in its title \\"Buccaneers Take Last From Robins\\", but the subtitle of the article reads \\"Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break\\". Space- conscious headline writers still used \\"the Flock\\" (derived from \\"Robins\\") during the Dodgers' last decade in Brooklyn. Another example of the interchangeability of different nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series, which identifies the matchup in the series as \\"Dodgers vs. Indians\\", despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent usage at this point for around six years. Rivalry with the Giants The historic and heated rivalry between the Dodgers and the Giants is more than a century old. It began when the Dodgers and Giants faced each other in the 1889 World Series, the ancestor of the Subway Series, and both played in separate cities (the Dodgers in Brooklyn and the Giants in New York City Manhattan). When both franchises moved to California after the 1957 season, the rivalry was easily transplanted, as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been rivals in economics, culture, and politics. \\"Uncle Robbie\\" and the \\"Daffiness Boys\\" Manager Wilbert Robinson, another former Oriole, popularly known as \\"Uncle Robbie\\", restored the Brooklyn team to respectability. His \\"Brooklyn Robins\\" reached the 1916 and 1920 World Series, losing both, but contending perennially for several seasons. Charles Ebbets and Ed McKeever died within a week of each other in 1925, and Robbie was named president while still field manager. Upon assuming the title of president, however, Robinson's ability to focus on the field declined, and the teams of the late 1920s were often fondly referred to as the \\"Daffiness Boys\\" for their distracted, error-ridden style of play. Outfielder Babe Herman was the leader both in hitting and in zaniness. The signature Dodger play from this era occurred when three players ‚Äì Dazzy Vance, Chick Fewster, and Herman ‚Äì ended up at third base at the same time. (The play is often remembered as Herman \\"tripling into a triple play\\", though only two of the three players were declared out and Herman was credited with a double rather than a triple.) Herman later complained that no one remembered that he drove in the winning run on the play. The incident led to the popular joke: *\\"The Dodgers have three men on base!\\" *\\"Oh, yeah? Which base?\\" After his removal as club president, Robinson returned to managing, and the club's performance rebounded somewhat. When Robinson retired in 1931, he was replaced as manager by Max Carey. Although some suggested renaming the \\"Robins\\" the \\"Brooklyn Canaries\\", after Carey, whose last name was originally \\"Carnarius\\", the name \\"Brooklyn Dodgers\\" returned to stay following Robinson's retirement. It was during this era that Willard Mullin, a noted sports cartoonist, fixed the Brooklyn team with the lovable nickname of \\"Dem Bums\\". After hearing his cab driver ask, \\"So how did those bums do today?\\", Mullin decided to sketch an exaggerated version of famed circus clown Emmett Kelly to represent the Dodgers in his much-praised cartoons in the New York World-Telegram. Both image and nickname caught on, so much so that many a Dodger yearbook cover, from 1951 through 1957, featured a Willard Mullin illustration of the Brooklyn Bum. Perhaps the highlight of the Daffiness Boys era came after Wilbert Robinson left the dugout. In 1934, Giants player/manager Bill Terry was asked about the Dodgers‚Äô chances in the coming pennant race and cracked infamously, \\"Is Brooklyn still in the league?\\" Managed then by Casey Stengel, who played for the Dodgers in the 1910s and went on to greatness managing the New York Yankees, the 1934 Dodgers were determined to make their presence felt. As it happened, the season entered its final games with the Giants tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the pennant, with the Giants‚Äô remaining games against the Dodgers. Stengel led his Bums to the Polo Grounds for the showdown, and they beat the Giants twice to knock them out of the pennant race. The \\"Gashouse Gang\\" Cardinals nailed the pennant by beating the Cincinnati Reds those same two days. One key development during this era was the 1938 appointment of Leland \\"Larry\\" MacPhail as Dodgers' general manager. MacPhail, who brought night games to Major League Baseball as general manager of the Reds, also started night baseball in Brooklyn and ordered the successful refurbishing of Ebbets Field. He also brought Reds voice Red Barber to Brooklyn as the Dodgers' lead announcer in 1939, just after MacPhail broke the New York baseball executives' agreement to ban live baseball broadcasts, enacted because of the fear of the effect of radio calls on the home teams' attendance. MacPhail remained with the Dodgers until 1942, when he returned to the Armed Forces for World War II. He later became one of the Yankees' co- owners, bidding unsuccessfully for Barber to join him in the Bronx as announcer. The first major-league baseball game to be televised was Brooklyn's 6‚Äì1 victory over Cincinnati at Ebbets Field on August 26, 1939. Batting helmets were introduced to Major League Baseball by the Dodgers in 1941. Breaking the color barrier Jackie Robinson. For most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed a black player. A parallel system of Negro Leagues developed, but most of the Negro League players were denied a chance to prove their skill before a national audience. Jackie Robinson became the first African-American to play Major League baseball in the 20th century when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947 as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson's entry into the league was mainly due to General Manager Branch Rickey's efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also present. Rickey was a member of the Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination to the United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the Civil Rights Movement. Rickey saw his opportunity with the 1944 death of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an arch-segregationist and enforcer of the color barrier. Besides selecting Robinson for his exceptional baseball skills, Rickey also considered Robinson's outstanding personal character, his UCLA education and rank of captain in the U.S. Army in his decision, since he knew that boos, taunts, and criticism were going to be directed at Robinson, and that Robinson had to be tough enough to withstand abuse without attempting to retaliate. The inclusion of Robinson on the team also led the Dodgers to move its spring training site. Prior to 1946, the Dodgers held their spring training in Jacksonville, Florida. However, the city's stadium refused to host an exhibition game with the Montreal Royals ‚Äì the Dodgers‚Äô own farm club ‚Äì on whose roster Robinson appeared at the time, citing segregation laws. Nearby Sanford similarly declined. Ultimately, City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach agreed to host the game with Robinson on the field. The team traveled to Havana, Cuba for spring training in 1947, this time with Robinson on the big club. Although the Dodgers ultimately built Dodgertown and its Holman Stadium further south in Vero Beach, and played there for 61 spring training seasons from 1948 through 2008, Daytona Beach renamed City Island Ballpark to Jackie Robinson Ballpark in his honor. This event marked the continuation of the integration of professional sports in the United States, with professional football having led the way in 1946, with the concomitant demise of the Negro Leagues, and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American civil rights movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947‚Äì1956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP Roy Campanella, Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam, and Joe Black. Robinson eventually became the first African-American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. \\"Wait ‚Äôtil next year!\\" After the wilderness years of the 1920s and 1930s, the Dodgers were rebuilt into a contending club first by general manager Larry MacPhail and then the legendary Branch Rickey. Led by Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, and Gil Hodges in the infield, Duke Snider and Carl Furillo in the outfield, Roy Campanella behind the plate, and Don Newcombe, Carl Erskine, and Preacher Roe on the pitcher's mound, the Dodgers won pennants in , , , , and , only to fall to the New York Yankees in all five of the subsequent World Series. The annual ritual of building excitement, followed in the end by disappointment, became a common pattern to the long suffering fans, and \\"Wait ‚Äôtil next year!\\" became an unofficial Dodger slogan. While the Dodgers generally enjoyed success during this period, in they fell victim to one of the largest collapses in the history of baseball. On August 11, 1951, Brooklyn led the National League by an enormous 13¬Ω games over their archrivals, the Giants. While the Dodgers went 26‚Äì22 from that time until the end of the season, the Giants went on an absolute tear, winning an amazing 37 of their last 44 games, including their last seven in a row. At the end of the season the Dodgers and the Giants were tied for first place, forcing a three- game playoff for the pennant. The Giants took Game 1 by a score of 3‚Äì1 before being shut out by the Dodgers' Clem Labine in Game 2, 10‚Äì0. It all came down to the final game, and Brooklyn seemed to have the pennant locked up, holding a 4‚Äì2 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning. Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson, however, hit a stunning three-run walk-off home run off the Dodgers' Ralph Branca to secure the NL Championship for New York. To this day Thomson's home run is known as the Shot Heard 'Round The World. In 1955, by which time the core of the Dodger team was beginning to age, \\"next year\\" finally came. The fabled \\"Boys of Summer\\" shot down the \\"Bronx Bombers\\" in seven games, led by the first-class pitching of young left-hander Johnny Podres, whose key pitch was a changeup known as \\"pulling down the lampshade\\" because of the arm motion used right when the ball was released. Podres won two Series games, including the deciding seventh. The turning point of Game 7 was a spectacular double play that began with left fielder Sandy Amor√≥s running down Yogi Berra's long fly ball, then throwing to shortstop Pee Wee Reese, who relayed to first baseman Gil Hodges to double up a surprised Gil McDougald to preserve the Dodger lead. Hank Bauer grounded out and the Dodgers won 2‚Äì0. Although the Dodgers lost the World Series to the Yankees in during which the Yankees pitcher Don Larsen pitched the only World Series perfect game in baseball history and the only post-season no-hitter for the next 54 years, it hardly seemed to matter. Brooklyn fans had their memory of triumph, and soon that was all they were left with ‚Äì a victory that was remembered decades later in the Billy Joel single \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\", which included the line, \\"Brooklyn's got a winning team.\\" Move to California Real estate businessman Walter O'Malley had acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, when he bought Rickey's 25 percent share of the team and secured the support of the widow of another equal partner, John L. Smith. Soon O'Malley was working to buy new land in Brooklyn for a new, more accessible and better ballpark than Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field had grown old and was not well served by infrastructure, to the point where the Dodgers could not \\"sell out\\" the park to maximum capacity even in the heat of a pennant race, despite dominating the league from 1946 to 1957. New York City Construction Coordinator Robert Moses, however, sought to force O'Malley into using a site in Flushing Meadows, Queens ‚Äì the eventual location of Shea Stadium, the home of the future New York Mets. Moses' vision involved a city- built, city-owned park, which was greatly at odds with O'Malley's real-estate savvy. When O'Malley realized that he was not going to be allowed to buy a suitable parcel of land in Brooklyn, he began thinking of team relocation. O'Malley was free to purchase land of his own choosing but wanted Robert Moses to condemn one parcel of land along the Atlantic Railroad Yards in downtown Brooklyn under Title I authority, after O'Malley had bought the bulk of the land he had in mind. Title I gave the city municipality power to condemn land for the purpose of building what it calls \\"public purpose\\" projects. Moses' interpretation of \\"public purpose\\" included public parks, public housing and public highways and bridges. What O'Malley wanted was for Moses to use Title I authority, rather than to pay market value for the land. With Title I the city via Robert Moses could have sold the land to O'Malley at a below market price. Moses refused to honor O'Malley's request and responded, \\"If you want the land so bad, why don't you purchase it with your own money?\\" Meanwhile, non-stop transcontinental airline travel had become routine during the years since the Second World War, and teams were no longer bound by much slower railroad timetables. Because of civil aviation advances, it became possible to locate teams farther apart ‚Äì as far west as California ‚Äì while maintaining the same busy game schedules. When Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to entice a team to move there, they were not even thinking of the Dodgers. Their original target had been the Washington Senators franchise, which eventually moved to Bloomington, Minnesota to become the Minnesota Twins in 1961. At the same time, O'Malley was looking for a contingency in case Moses and other New York politicians refused to let him build the Brooklyn stadium he wanted, and sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. Los Angeles offered him what New York did not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all its revenue streams. At the same time, the National League was not willing to approve the Dodgers' move unless O'Malley found a second team willing to join them out west, largely out of concern for travel costs. Meanwhile, Giants owner Horace Stoneham was having similar difficulty finding a replacement for his team's antiquated home stadium, the Polo Grounds. Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minneapolis, but was persuaded instead to move them to San Francisco, ensuring that the Dodgers had a National League rival closer than St. Louis. So the two arch-rival teams, the Dodgers and Giants, moved out to the West Coast together after the 1957 season. The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2‚Äì0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On April 18, 1958, the Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game in L.A., defeating the former New York and newly relocated and renamed San Francisco Giants, 6‚Äì5, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season automobile accident on January 28, 1958, was never able to play for Los Angeles. A 2007 HBO film, Brooklyn Dodgers: The Ghosts of Flatbush, is a documentary covering the Dodgers history from early days to the beginning of the Los Angeles era. In the film, the story is related that O'Malley was so hated by Brooklyn Dodger fans after the move to California, that it was said, \\"If you asked a Brooklyn Dodger fan, if you had a gun with only two bullets in it and were in a room with Hitler, Stalin and O'Malley, who would you shoot? The answer: O'Malley, twice!\\" References Other reading * * * Category:Brooklyn Dodgers Brooklyn Dodgers Category:Jackie Robinson Category:Defunct baseball teams in New York (state) ","title":"History of the Brooklyn Dodgers"},{"id":"25036639","text":"Athera (born P√•l Mathiesen on 14 August 1977) is a Norwegian musician, best known as the former vocalist of Susperia.

The cast included Lon McCallister, Peggy Ann Garner, Preston Foster, Forrest Tucker, Skip Homeier, and Gene Reynolds. Karlson said the film \\"was a complete social statement. That was my answer to John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Plot Drought during the 1930s forces a large cougar to come down from the high country in Utah to prey on farmers' cattle. This has prompted many farmers to pursue and kill the cat, but so far all have failed. Danny Turner (Lon McCallister) arrives in the area to move into his mother's birthplace now owned by his stepfather Tom Eggars (Preston Foster). Tom is constantly threatened by a hostile neighbor, Gil Hawkes (Forrest Tucker). Shortly after Danny arrives Tom and Gil have a scuffle, a sure sign of a soon-to-be war. When Danny arrives he meets Doris Cooper (Peggy Ann Garner), whom he develops a crush on. After some close calls with Gil, the drought and the cougar become such big issues that the mayor of a nearby town announces that a hunt be started for the big cat. The hunt is unsuccessful, with the Eggars' dog chasing the cougar back to its lair and the party left behind. Tom tells Danny that he may have to move away and live with the Hawkes family due to the troubles he is having around the farm. The next day he goes to the hill to show Gil and his family that he will come live with them. Gil's son Jim (Skip Homeier) teases Danny about his failure to kill the cougar and their dislike of Tom. Danny then refuses to live with them because he remembers Gil is the one who mistreated his mother and refused to let her marry Tom. Tom hears this and attacks Gil, and the two fight. Danny and Jim also get into a fight when the angered Jim accuses Danny of starting the fight. Danny and Tom win both fights and Tom tells Gil that Danny will continue living with him. The next morning Tom takes Danny hunting, but due to his dislike of killing animals Danny refuses to take a shot at a deer. Understanding this, Tom takes the gun and shoots the deer himself. However, the cougar hears the noise and follows them to Tom's cabin. While Tom and Danny are in the shed, preparing to cut up the deer, the cougar enters the farm and nibbles at the carcass. Tom fires at the cougar and pursues it into the woods. Meanwhile, Danny goes back into the woods to retrieve a gun he left there. Tom chases the cougar, firing at it, but the cougar then surprises him by attacking from above. The cougar kills Tom and runs off into the wilderness. Grieved at Tom's death, Doris pleads for Danny not to go after the dangerous cougar, but the vengeful Danny vows to do so. With his dog, Danny leaves in search of the cougar. He and his dog have an eventful chase with the cat before they corner it inside a small cave. Unable to see in the dark, Danny and his dog are at a disadvantage and are attacked by the cougar. In the ensuing battle, Danny's dog is almost killed, but Danny is able to kill the cougar. Later Danny and Doris celebrate the cat's defeat. With the cat gone, Gil and Jim will no longer be a threat to Danny and Doris, now possible lovers.

B. & R. Knight and was one of the largest textile manufacturers in the world when he died in 1912. He co-founded the clothing brand Fruit of the Loom, now owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Early life Knight was born in Old Warwick, Rhode Island, on January 8, 1826, to Stephen Knight and Weltham Brayton. After moving to Cranston, Rhode Island, Knight's father put Robert to work in the Cranston Print Works when he was eight years old. Knight later worked in Coventry, Rhode Island, for Elisha Harris until he was 17 years old working for $1.25 per week. In 1843 Knight began working for his brother Benjamin as a store clerk. Two years later with the help of a friend, Knight studied for a year and a half at Pawcatuck Academy in Westerly, Rhode Island, after which he taught school in Exeter, Rhode Island, for four months. Manufacturing career The Clinton Mill in Woonsocket, Rhode Island was one of many Rhode Island mills owned by the Knight brothers In 1846 Knight was employed by John Hopkins Clarke as a clerk in his factory store at Arnold's Bridge, now Pontiac, Rhode Island. After Clark was elected to the U.S. Senate, Knight and a partner purchased the business and became owners of the Pontiac Mills. In 1852 Knight with his brother, Benjamin Knight formed B. B. and R. Knight a manufacturing and grain firm. Later along with other partners, they formed and purchased numerous manufacturing operations in New England. The brothers also became involved in the banking and insurance industries. The Knights built employee housing, mill villages, and donated funds to build various denominations of churches for the mill workers. In 1851 Knight formed Fruit of the Loom and trademarked the well known fruit trademark in the 1870s soon after the trademark registry was established.

He, along with several other Russian bishops in exile, established an independent Russian church administration that sought to embrace all Russian Orthodox diaspora, known as the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). Biography In Russia Aleksey Pavlovich Khrapovitsky was born in Russia on 17 March (O.S.) 1863 in Vatagino (now Okulovsky District, Novgorod Oblast), the son of a noble landowner and general. After receiving secular secondary education at the 5th Petersburg Gymnasium, in a move that was at the time highly unusual for a young man of his pedigree and education, he studied at the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy, from which he graduated in 1885. In that year he became a monk and was given the name Antony in honor of St. Antony the Roman of Novgorod. Archbishop Anthony. Canvas by Mikhail Nesterov. 1917 From 1887, he taught at the Academy where he had studied, and in 1890, he was appointed as rector of the St Petersburg seminary and raised to the rank of archimandrite. Later he was appointed rector of the Moscow Theological Academy in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius (1890‚Äì1894), then in 1895 he was transferred to the post of rector of the Kazan Theological Academy (until 1900). On 7 September 1897, Archimandrite Anthony was consecrated Bishop of Cheboksary, vicar of the Kazan diocese. On 14 July 1900, he was transferred to Ufa as Bishop of Ufa and Menzelinsk. As a significant part of the residents of the Ufa province were Muslim, Bishop Anthony worked on missionary efforts in his diocese. On 22 April 1902, Bishop Anthony was appointed to the Volyn and Zhytomyr cathedra (based in Zhytomyr). In 1905, he was a co-founder of Zhytomyr‚Ä≤s chapter of the Union of the Russian People. In 1907, Bishop Anthony headed a commission charged with examining the Kiev Theological Academy. The commission's findings were unpopular with the Academy‚Ä≤s staff, leading to Bishop Anthony's publication of \\"The Truth about the Kiev Theological Academy\\" and the resignation of its rector, Bishop Platon (Rozhdestvesky), the future head of the American Metropolia. In 1906‚Äì1907, Bishop Anthony was member of the State Council and in 1912-1916 of the Holy Synod. He worked on the preparation for a Local Council of the Russian Church; he responded to the 1905 questionnaire of Russian bishops by calling for the restoration of the patriarchy and the reform of theological education and other reforms in Church administration. On 19 May 1914, he was appointed to the Kharkov and Akhtyrka cathedra. After the February 1917 Revolution, he was forced to ask for retirement because of poor relations with the new authorities in his area and the discontent of certain members of his clergy. On 1 May 1917, he was retired and assigned to the Valaam Monastery, where he wrote his book \\"The Doctrine of Redemption,\\" which later caused controversy among Orthodox theologians. In August 1917 he was again elected Archbishop of Kharkov by the Diocesan council of Kharkov. In 1917-1918, he took part in the Local Council of the Russian Church, at which he advocated restoring the patriarchate in the Church of Russia. After the decision on restoration of Russian patriarchy passed (three days after the Bolsheviks‚Ä≤ capture of power in Petrograd), his candidacy for this eminent position received the largest number of votes ‚Äî 159 (out of 309) ‚Äî but on 5 November 1918, Metropolitan Tikhon of Moscow was elected by lot out of the three candidates, the weakest candidate of the vote. On 28 November, Archbishop Anthony was raised to the rank of metropolitan and on 7 December elected a member of the Holy Synod headed by Patriarch Tikhon. In January 1918, Metropolitan Anthony was present at the All-Ukrainian Church Council in Kiev. He then fled the city before the Bolshevik invasion. Following the killing of Metropolitan Vladimir (Bogoyavlesky) of Kiev, Metropolitan Anthony was elected to the Kiev cathedra, and returned when the city was occupied by the Germans. However, his election was not approved by the authorities because of his opposition to Ukrainian autocephaly. In mid-December 1918, together with Archbishop Eulogius (Georgiyevsky) of Volyn, he was arrested by the Symon Petliura government. The hierarchs, along with Bishop Nicodemus (Krotkov) of Chigirin, were held at the Basilian monastery in Buchach. In the spring of 1919, when Buchach was taken by Polish forces, they were transferred to the Camaldolese monastery near Krakow. In the summer of 1919 they were freed through the work of the French diplomatic mission. Metropolitan Anthony lived in Lvov. In September 1919, he left for Kuban, then returned to Kiev, which was held by White forces of General Denikin. After Kiev was retaken by Bolsheviks in November 1919, he left for Yekaterinodar, where he was elected as president of the Temporary Higher Church Authority of South-East Russia. After the defeat of the Denikin army, in March 1920 he left for Greece, where he received the support of Archbishop Meletius (Metaxakis) of Athens. In September 1920, he was invited by Gen Pyotr Wrangel to Crimea, then controlled by Wrangel‚Ä≤s anti-Bolshevik forces. After the latter's defeat in November 1920, Antony left Russia for good. In exile Between November 1920 and February 1921, Metropolitan Anthony was in Constantinople, then occupied by British, French and Italian forces. At first he decided that the Temporary Church Authority should be abolished and pastoral care for displaced Russians handed over to other local churches. However, after learning of the decision of Gen Wrangel to keep his army, Metropolitan Anthony decided to keep the Church organization abroad as well. The Temporary Authority met on 19 November 1920, aboard the ship \\"Great Prince Alexader Mikhailovich,\\" presided over by Metropolitan Anthony. He and Bishop Benjamin (Fedchenkov) were appointed to examine the canonicity of the organization. On 2 December 1920, they received permission from Metropolitan Dorotheos of Prussia, Locum Tenens of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, to establish \\"for the purpose of the service of the population [...] and to oversee the ecclesiastic life of Russian colonies in Orthodox countries a temporary committee (epitropia) under the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate\\"; the committee was called the Temporary Higher Church Administration Abroad (THCAA). On 14 February 1921, Metropolitan Anthony settled down in Sremski Karlovci, where he was given the palace of former Patriarchs of Karlovci (the Patriarchate of Karlovci had been abolished in 1920).‚Ä≥–ó–∞–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞ —Ü—Ä–∫–≤–∞ —É –°—Ä–µ–º—Å–∫–∏–º –ö–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤—Ü–∏–º–∞: –ò–∑ —Ç–∞—ò–Ω–∏—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞ –£–î–ë–ï: –†–£–°–ö–ê –ï–ú–ò–ì–†–ê–¶–ò–à–ê –£ –à–£–ì–û–°–õ–ê–í–ò–à–ò 1918‚Äì1941.‚Ä≥ // Politika, 23 December 2017, p. 22. In the course of the subsequent few months, at the invitation of Patriarch Dimitrije of Serbia, the other eight bishops of the THCAA, including Anastasius (Gribanovsky) and Benjamin (Fedchenkov), as well as numerous priests and monks, relocated to Serbia.‚Ä≥–ü—Ä–∏—Ö–≤–∞—õ–µ–Ω –ø–æ–∑–∏–≤ –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–∞—Ä—Ö–∞ –î–∏–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–∞: –ò–∑ —Ç–∞—ò–Ω–∏—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞ –£–î–ë–ï: –†–£–°–ö–ê –ï–ú–ò–ì–†–ê–¶–ò–à–ê –£ –à–£–ì–û–°–õ–ê–í–ò–à–ò 1918‚Äì1941.‚Ä≥ // Politika, 21 December 2017, p. 25. On 31 August 1921, the Council of Bishops of the Serbian Church recognised the THCAA as an administratively independent jurisdiction over the Russian exiled clergy outside the Kingdom of SHS as well as those Russian clergy in the Kingdom of SHS who were not in parish or state educational service; the THCAA jurisdiction would also extend to marital and divorce disputes of the exiled Russians. Gen Pyotr Wrangel, chairman of the Russian All-Military Union (second left), and Met Anthony in Dedinje, Belgrade, on Easter, April 1927 With the agreement of Patriarch Dimitrije of Serbia, the \\"General assembly of representatives of the Russian Church abroad\\" took place between 21 November and 2 December 1921, in Sremski Karlovci. It was later renamed the First All-Diaspora Council and was presided over by Metropolitan Anthony. The Council established the \\"Supreme Ecclesiastic Administration Abroad\\" (SEAA), composed of a patriarchal Locum Tenens, a Synod of Bishops, and a Church Council. The Council decided to appoint Metropolitan Anthony the Locum Tenens, but he declined to accept the position without permission from Moscow and instead called himself the President of the SEAA. However, an Decree of Patriarch St. Tikhon of Moscow of 5 May 1922, abolished the SEAA and declared the political decisions of the Karlovci Council as not reflecting the position of the Russian Church. Meeting in Sremski Karlovci on 2 September 1922, the Council of Bishops agreed to abolish the SEAA, in its place forming the Temporary Holy Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia with Metropolitan Anthony as its head by virtue of seniority. The Synod exercised direct authority over Russian parishes in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Far East. In North America, however, a conflict erupted with those who did not recognize the authority of the Synod, led by Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky); this group formed the American Metropolia, the predecessor to the OCA. Likewise, in Western Europe, Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgievsky) also did not recognize anything more than \\"a moral authority\\" of the Synod. Metropolitan Eulogius later broke off and in February 1931 joined the Ecumenical Patriarchate, forming the Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe. On 9 September 1927, the Council of Bishops of the ROCOR, presided over by Metropolitan Anthony, decreed a formal break of communion with ecclesiastic authorities in Moscow after categorically rejecting a demand by Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) of Nizhny Novgorod, who was acting as Locum Tenens, to declare political loyalty to the Soviet authorities. Then, on 22 June 1934, Metropolitan Sergius and his Synod in Moscow passed judgment on Metropolitan Anthony and his Synod, declaring them to be under suspension. Metropolitan Anthony refused to recognize this decision, claiming that it was made under political pressure from Soviet authorities and that Metropolitan Sergius had illegally usurped the position of Locum Tenens. In this, he received the support of the Patriarch Varnava of Serbia, who continued to maintain communion with the ROCOR Synod. During the course of his time outside Russia, Metropolitan Anthony continued to retain the title of Metropolitan of Kiev and Galicia, although his name stopped being mentioned in prayers in Kiev since June 1922.–ú–ò–¢–†–û–ü–û–õ–ò–¢ –ê–ù–¢–û–ù–ò–ô (–•–†–ê–ü–û–í–ò–¶–ö–ò–ô) ‚Äì –ö–ò–ï–í–°–ö–ò–ô –ê–†–•–ò–ü–ê–°–¢–´–†–¨, –í–û–ó–ì–õ–ê–í–ò–í–®–ò–ô –ó–ê–†–£–ë–ï–ñ–ù–£–Æ –¶–ï–†–ö–û–í–¨ In March 1931, the Synod of Bishops awarded him the title of \\"Beatitude.\\" He became known as a polemicist who argued against papal supremacy.

Some of his theological views, especially his soteriology, were severely criticised by a number of prominent Orthodox theologians.

The prototype was completed in 1954, but it was denied authorization to enter flight testing and the program was cancelled in 1956. Development The Yak-140 was developed around the Mikulin AM-11 turbojet (rated at thrust dry and with afterburner) to meet a specification issued in 1953 requiring a supersonic fighter with a maximum speed of and a range of . It was to be armed with three cannon with 75 rounds per gun and was to be capable of carrying air-to-ground rockets as well as of bombs. Its fully loaded weight was to be and it was to be ready to be submitted for State acceptance trials in March 1955.Gordon, et al., p. 190 The fighter had a circular-section semi-monocoque fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar was fitted in the conical inlet cone of the air intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55¬∞ at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was faired into the spine that ran the length of the top of the fuselage. The tandem landing gear had a single wheel on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.Gunston, p. 488 The aircraft's State acceptance trials were delayed until the first quarter of 1956 for lack of a flight-ready AM-11 engine, but it had to be adapted to use a less powerful Mikulin AM-9D engine with only of dry thrust. The gun armament was reduced to only two Nudelman- Rikhter NR-23 guns with 75 rounds per gun in compensation, but the estimated speed dropped by about regardless. This was deemed to be acceptable as it sufficed to begin flight testing. The prototype was completed in December 1954 and it passed all the necessary ground tests by 10 February 1955 when it was cleared to begin flight trials. However, the (Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP)) denied Yakovlev authorization to begin flight tests as it favored competing designs from Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich. A Council of Ministers directive was issued on 28 March 1956 to terminate the program and the corresponding MAP order followed on 6 April.

It is located between Trinidad to the south and Orick at the mouth of Redwood Creek to the north. The lagoons are shallow bays between rocky headlands where coastal wave action has formed a sandy bar separating each lagoon from the Pacific Ocean. The lagoons are resting areas for migratory waterfowl using the Pacific Flyway between Lake Earl on the Smith River estuarine wetlands to the north and Humboldt Bay on the Mad River estuarine wetlands to the south. left Geology Big Lagoon is similar to other coastal features of northern California including Humboldt Bay to the south and Lake Earl to the north; an alluvial plain is surrounded by steep uplands. Hills adjacent to Big Lagoon have been identified as the Franciscan Assemblage along the eastern shore and Pleistocene dune sandstone to the south. Studies around Humboldt Bay indicate tectonic activity along the Cascadia subduction zone has caused local sea level changes at intervals of several centuries. The plain may support fresh water wetlands or Sitka Spruce forests following uplift events and salt marsh or inundated shellfish beds following subsidence events. At the present lagoon level, the sand bar normally separates the lagoon from the ocean during summer months. Winter precipitation may raise the water level in the lagoon a few meters above sea level. Hydrostatic pressure and storm surf may then breach the sand bar allowing the lagoon to drain into the sea and then receive tidal inflow until wave action reforms the bar.Barrier Breaching Processes and Barrier Spit Breach, Stone Lagoon, California History Roosevelt elk graze the wetlands south of the lagoon and may sometimes be seen where U.S. Route 101 crosses the lagoon.

Detectives blamed the violence on warring Asian gangs.  Incident  Just after 1:30 a.m. on July 5, 1998, three masked gunmen burst into the Trang Dai Cafe and opened fire in the karaoke bar, killing four men and wounding five others. Two other gunmen kept watch out back and killed a waitress as she tried to leave. In all, 41 shots were fired. The five killed were: Nhan Ai Nguyen, 26; Duy Le, 25; his brother, 27-year-old Hai Le; Tuong Hung Do, 33; and waitress Tuyen Vo, 21. Five were injured and eventually recovered from those injuries. Prosecutors claimed the suspects were targeting a patron, who was injured, because of a personal gripe. The crime remains one of Tacoma's worst mass slayings.  Investigation  On July 18, 1998, Tacoma police officers conducted a large police operation in which they searched nine homes while looking for eight suspects in the case. Four were arrested during the operation. A fifth was arrested the next day on July 19. An AK-47 found at one of the suspects‚Äô homes was traced back to Bull's Eye Shooter Supply. The same gun shop that was the source of the weapon used in the Beltway sniper attacks. The suspected ringleader, 22-year-old Ri Le, killed his younger half-brother, 17-year-old Khanh Trinh, (one of the gunman stationed at the back of the cafe) then himself in a murder-suicide pact as police officers closed in. Another suspect, 18-year-old Samath Mom, committed suicide in jail just a few hours after his arrest. The other five ‚Äì Jimmie Chea, Marvin Leo, Veasna Sok, Sarun Truck Ngeth and John Phet ‚Äì were convicted and sentenced.

The health conditions of this country vary according to these regions. In the sierras, in cities such as Quito or Cuenca where most Ecuadorians live, health conditions most commonly associated with the tropics do not exist. For example, the types of mosquitoes which carry malaria and dengue fever cannot live at altitudes above 2300 meters (according to the US Centers for Disease Control) as is the case in virtually all of the sierras. While there does not seem to be general agreement in the medical community about the prevalence of altitude-related conditions, some visitors to the highlands may experience symptoms. The lower atmospheric pressure of the sierras affects some individuals profoundly with difficulty in breathing, nausea and dizziness but these conditions are typically not of long duration and require a period of reduced activity and conservative eating and drinking for acclimatization. Ecuadorians living most of their lives in the sierras commonly require a brief period of re-adjustment after living at sea level for prolonged periods of time. In the low-lying coastal regions and in the Amazonian region, the predictable diseases of those climates exist. Malaria, for example, is according to UN sources no longer epidemic in Ecuador. Nor is Dengue Fever. The potential for these diseases does exist but mostly in isolated, economically-depressed areas of the Amazon and seacoast. Many do not realize that dengue-infected mosquitoes exist in the southeastern US but do not infect inhabitants on a widespread basis. Life expectancy is approximately that of the US. As in many countries, Ecuador has a comprehensive national health system. Free medical care (with an extensive system of hospitals and regional health clinics) is available to all residents regardless of income and without buying any type of medical insurance. An extensive, proactive program of public health includes actions such as teams of nurses going door- to-door offering influenza vaccine to residents. Remote rural areas are also served by this system with physicians, dentists and nurses performing an obligatory one-year \\"rural\\" in which they serve isolated or underserved populations. In Ecuador, this one year of service is mandatory for professional licensing. For residents who are members of the national Social Security Institute, an additional, modern system of hospitals and clinics is provided through employee and employer payroll deductions or voluntary payments as is the case with many expatriates residing in Ecuador. The monthly contribution for voluntary members (family of 2) of this system is just over $80. Employees, on the other hand, contribute .0935 of their salaries for this coverage but this also includes membership in the national pension system. Private health care is also available in the form of mostly smaller, doctor- owned health clinics. Private health insurance can be purchased but, as in many countries, is largely used by those of middle and upper income groups. Ecuador has benefited from the Cuban system of medical education sending over 100 students per year (for over 10 years) to the Escuela de Medicina Latinoamericana at no cost to the government of Ecuador or the students. A requirement of the program is that 50% of these students be women. Before returning to practice in Ecuador, it is common for these doctors to complete specialized residencies in the major cities of Argentina and Chile among other countries. Additionally, Cuban nationals are numerous among the professors in the faculties of medicine in the major cities of Ecuador including Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca and Ambato.  Health services  The current structure of the Ecuadorian public health care system dates back to 1967.Lrrea, Julio. \\"25 A√±os de Vida Institucional\\", Imprenta del Ministerio de Salud Publica, Quito 2008. The Ministry of Public Health (Ministerio de Salud Publica del Ecuador) is responsible for the regulation and creation of public health policies and health care plans. The Minister of Public Health is appointed directly by the President of the republic. David Chiriboga, a specialist and researcher in community medicine, was appointed Minister in April 2010 but resigned in January 2012, and was replaced by Carina Vance. The philosophy of the Ministry of Public Health is to give social support and services to the most vulnerable populationsProgram of the Ministry of Public Health - Ecuador and its main plan of action lies around community health and preventive medicine. The Ecuadorian public health care system permits patients to be treated daily as outpatients in public general hospitals, with no previous appointment, by general practitioners and specialists. This is organized around the four basic specialties of pediatric medicine, gynecology, clinical medicine, and surgery. Specialty hospitals are also part of the public health care system to target chronic diseases or a particular group of the population. For instance, there are oncological hospitals (SOLCA) to treat cancer patients, children's hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, gynecologic and maternity hospitals, geriatric hospitals, ophthalmologic hospitals and gastroenterological hospitals, among others. Although fully equipped general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of the provinces, there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and canton cities for family care consultation and treatment in pediatrics, gynecology, clinical medicine, and surgery. Community health care centers (Centros de Salud), or day hospitals, are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas. These day hospitals give care to patients whose hospitalization is less than 24 hours. Most of the rural communities in Ecuador have a sizable population of indigenous people; the doctors assigned to those communities, called also \\"rural doctors\\", are in charge of small clinics to meet the needs of these patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities. The care given in rural hospitals is required to respect the culture of the community. The MSP provides health services to 30 percent of the Ecuadorian population. The Social Security Institute covers 18 percent of the population. Two percent is covered by the Armed Forces. NGO's (Non Governmental Organizations) cover about five percent. Private services cover 20 percent.fhttp://users.sbuniv.edu/~ptompkins/Student%20Presentations/Health%20Care%20System%20of%20Ecuador.pdf In 2011 there were 1.7 medical practitioners per 1,000 population.

Specific health problems that are common in Ecuador: infant mortality, acute respiratory infection, diarrhetic diseases, dengue fever, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, health problems due to smoking, malnutrition.http://users.sbuniv.edu/~ptompkins/Student%20Presentations/Health%20Care%20System%20of%20Ecuador.pdfAccording to WHO data on confirmed cases of malaria, Ecuador had 8464 cases per 100,000 population in 2007 and 544 cases in 2012 (the latest year in WHO figures). Changes in living conditions and health care appear to have had a significant effect on this condition In Ecuador, there are approximately 14000 cases of TB per year. The HIV prevalence rate among persons aged 15‚Äì49 is 0.3%.http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/ecuador.html Stunting from chronic malnutrition affects 26% of children under 5. There are approximately 686 malaria cases per 100,000 people.  Economic components  Health has a high correlation with economic status in Ecuador. Private health care is often much more efficient, and can only be afforded by the rich.  Social components  Afro-Ecuadorian children and Indigenous children are more likely to grow up in poverty and, as a result, face medical problems. Rates of chronic malnutrition are worse for indigenous children.  Environmental components  thumb Ecuador is divided into 4 regions; The Andes, The Amazon Basin, The Coast and The Galapagos Islands. Harsh climates in each region pose a number of threats to human health.http://www.traveltoecuador.net/regions.htm Due to the lack of oxygen in the Andes because of high altitude, altitude sickness may arise. It is mostly tourists coming from low-altitude regions that are affected by altitude sickness.http://www.princeton.edu/~rcurtis/altitude.html The amazon's many species do pose threats to human health. Diseases like malaria and yellow fever can be transferred to humans by infected mosquitoes. Deforestation in the Amazon causes an increase in the number of cases of malaria, because deforestation creates more breeding grounds for mosquitoes.http://www.vanaqua.org/education/.../amazon.html Access to clean drinking water is also an issue in Ecuador.http://www.paho.org/english/dd/ais/cp_218.htm Water borne diseases like cholera can be transferred to humans through frequently drinking water that is not cleaned and filtered. Not treating wastewater and not having proper sewer systems pose the same threats.http://www.lenntech.com 21.9% of households in Ecuador do not have access to clean drinking water. 5% of wastewater is treated. 48% of households have sewer systems.

Most congressional support for Dodd-Frank came from members of the Democratic Party, but three Senate Republicans voted for the bill, allowing it to overcome the Senate filibuster. Dodd-Frank reorganized the financial regulatory system, eliminating the Office of Thrift Supervision, assigning new responsibilities to existing agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and creating new agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB was charged with protecting consumers against abuses related to credit cards, mortgages, and other financial products. The act also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research to identify threats to the financial stability of the United States, and gave the Federal Reserve new powers to regulate systemically important institutions. To handle the liquidation of large companies, the act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority. One provision, the Volcker Rule, restricts banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments. The act also repealed the exemption from regulation for security-based swaps, requiring credit-default swaps and other transactions to be cleared through either exchanges or clearinghouses. Other provisions affect issues such as corporate governance, 1256 Contracts, and credit rating agencies. Dodd-Frank is generally regarded as one of the most significant laws enacted during the presidency of Barack Obama. Studies have found the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act has improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there has been debate regarding its economic effects. In 2017, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen stated that \\"the balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.\\" Some critics have argued that the law had a negative impact on economic growth and small banks, or failed to provide adequate regulation to the financial industry. Many Republicans have called for the partial or total repeal of the law.

Legislative response and passage President Barack Obama meeting with Rep. Barney Frank, Sen. Dick Durbin, and Sen. Chris Dodd, at the White House prior to a financial regulatory reform announcement on June 17, 2009. The bills that came after Obama's proposal were largely consistent with the proposal, but contained some additional provisions and differences in implementation. The Volcker Rule was not included in Obama's initial June 2009 proposal, but Obama proposed the ruleObama on the Volcker Rule: * * later in January 2010, after the House bill had passed. The rule, which prohibits depository banks from proprietary trading (similar to the prohibition of combined investment and commercial banking in the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act), was passed only in the Senate bill, and the conference committee enacted the rule in a weakened form, Section 619 of the bill, that allowed banks to invest up to 3 percent of their tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds as well as trade for hedging purposes. On December 2, 2009, revised versions of the bill were introduced in the House of Representatives by then‚Äìfinancial services committee chairman Barney Frank, and in the Senate Banking Committee by former chairman Chris Dodd. The initial version of the bill passed the House largely along party lines in December by a vote of 223 to 202, and passed the Senate with amendments in May 2010 with a vote of 59 to 39 again largely along party lines. The bill then moved to conference committee, where the Senate bill was used as the base text although a few House provisions were included in the bill's base text. The final bill passed the Senate in a vote of 60-to-39, the minimum margin necessary to defeat a filibuster. Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, and Scott Brown were the only Republican senators who voted for the bill, while Russ Feingold was the lone Senate Democrat to vote against the bill. One provision on which the White House did not take a position and remained in the final bill allows the SEC to rule on \\"proxy access\\"‚Äîmeaning that qualifying shareholders, including groups, can modify the corporate proxy statement sent to shareholders to include their own director nominees, with the rules set by the SEC. This rule was unsuccessfully challenged in conference committee by Chris Dodd, who‚Äîunder pressure from the White House‚Äîsubmitted an amendment limiting that access and ability to nominate directors only to single shareholders who have over 5 percent of the company and have held the stock for at least two years.Proxy access rule: * * The \\"Durbin amendment\\"Durbin Amendment to S. 3217 , the Senate version. The amendment passed 64‚Äì33 . is a provision in the final bill aimed at reducing debit card interchange fees for merchants and increasing competition in payment processing.

Repeal efforts  Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, many Republicans have called for a partial or total repeal of Dodd-Frank. On June 9, 2017, The Financial Choice Act, legislation that would \\"undo significant parts\\" of Dodd- Frank, passed the House 233‚Äì186. On March 14, 2018, the Senate passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act exempting dozens of U.S. banks from the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act's banking regulations.

The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is categorized into 16 titles and, by one law firm's count, it requires that regulators create 243 rules, conduct 67 studies, and issue 22 periodic reports.Davis Polk. (9 July 2010). Summary of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Passed by the House of Representatives on June 30, 2010. The stated aim of the legislation is The Act changes the existing regulatory structure, by creating a number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a systemic risk, amending the Federal Reserve Act, promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded bailouts of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession. The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Of the existing agencies, changes are proposed, ranging from new powers to the transfer of powers in an effort to enhance the regulatory system. The institutions affected by these changes include most of the regulatory agencies currently involved in monitoring the financial system (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve (the \\"Fed\\"), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), etc.), and the final elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision (further described in Title III‚ÄîTransfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the FED). As a practical matter, prior to the passage of Dodd‚ÄìFrank, investment advisers were not required to register with the SEC if the investment adviser had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold himself out generally to the public as an investment adviser. The act eliminates that exemption, rendering numerous additional investment advisers, hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements. However, the Act also shifted oversight of non-exempt investment advisers with less than $100 million in assets under management and not registered in more than 15 states to state regulators. A study published in the American Economic Review in 2019 (by Ben Charoenwong of the National University of Singapore, Alan Kwan at Hong Kong University, and Tarik Umar at Rice University) found that this switch in enforcement to state regulators increased misconduct among investment advisers by thirty to forty percent, with a bigger increase in areas with less sophisticated clients, less competition, and among advisers with more conflicts of interest, most likely because on average state regulators have less resources and enforcement capacity compared to the SEC. Certain non-bank financial institutions and their subsidiaries will be supervised by the Fed ¬ß 161 in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were a bank holding company. ¬ß¬ß 162(a),163 To the extent that the Act affects all federal financial regulatory agencies, eliminating one (the Office of Thrift Supervision) and creating two (Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research) in addition to several consumer protection agencies, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this legislation in many ways represents a change in the way America's financial markets will operate in the future. Few provisions of the Act became effective when the bill was signed. Provisions Title I‚ÄîFinancial Stability Title I, or the \\"Financial Stability Act of 2010\\",, ¬ß 101 outlines two new agencies tasked to monitor systemic risk and research the state of the economy and clarifies the comprehensive supervision of bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve. Title I creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) in the U.S. Treasury Department. These two agencies are designed to work closely together. The council is formed of 10 voting members, 9 of whom are federal regulators and 5 nonvoting supporting members, to encourage interagency collaboration and knowledge transfer., ¬ß 112(a)(2) The treasury secretary is chairman of the council, and the head of the Financial Research Office is appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate. Title I introduced the ability to impose stricter regulations on certain institutions by classifying them as SIFI's (systemically important financial institutions); according to Paul Krugman, this has resulted in institutions reducing risk to avoid such classification. Under section 165d, certain institutions must prepare resolution plans (so-called living wills), the first round of which was rejected by the Federal Reserve System in 2014. The process can be seen as a way to regulate and reduce shadow banking activities by banking institutions. = Financial Stability Oversight Council = The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked to identify threats to the financial stability of the United States, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging risks in order to stabilize the United States financial system. At a minimum, it must meet quarterly. The Council is required to report to Congress on the state of the financial system and may direct the Office of Financial Research to conduct research. ¬ß 112(a)(2) Notable powers include # With a two-thirds vote, it may place nonbank financial companies or domestic subsidiaries of international banks under the supervision of the Federal Reserve if it appears that these companies could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. ¬ß 113 # Under certain circumstances, the council may provide for more stringent regulation of a financial activity by issuing recommendations to the primary financial regulatory agency, which the primary financial agency is obliged to implement‚Äîthe council reports to Congress on the implementation or failure to implement such recommendations. ¬ß 120 # The council may require any bank or nonbank financial institution with assets over $50 billion to submit certified financial reports., ¬ß 116 # With the approval of the council, the Federal Reserve may promulgate safe harbor regulations to exempt certain types of foreign banks from regulation. ¬ß 170 =Office of Financial Research= The Office of Financial Research is designed to support the Financial Stability Oversight Council through data collection and research. The director has subpoena power and may require from any financial institution (bank or nonbank) any data needed to carry out the functions of the office. ¬ß 152(f) The Office can also issue guidelines to standardizing the way data is reported; constituent agencies have three years to implement data standardization guidelines. ¬ß 153 It is intended to be self- funded through the Financial Research Fund within two years of enactment, with the Federal Reserve providing funding in the initial interim period. ¬ß 155 In many ways, the Office of Financial Research is to be operated without the constraints of the Civil Service system. For example, it does not need to follow federal pay-scale guidelines (see above), and it is mandated that the office have workforce development plans ¬ß 156 that are designed to ensure that it can attract and retain technical talent, which it is required to report about congressional committees for its first five years., ¬ß 156(b) Title II‚ÄîOrderly Liquidation Authority The New York City headquarters of Lehman Brothers at the time of its collapse in 2008. Before Dodd‚ÄìFrank, federal laws to handle the liquidation and receivership of federally regulated banks existed for supervised banks, insured depository institutions, and securities companies by the FDIC or Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Dodd‚ÄìFrank expanded these laws to potentially handle insurance companies and nonbank financial companies and changed these liquidation laws in certain ways., ¬ß 201 Once it is determined that a financial company satisfied the criteria for liquidation, if the financial company's board of directors does not agree, provisions are made for judicial appeal., ¬ß 202 Depending on the type of financial institution, different regulatory organizations may jointly or independently, by two-thirds vote, determine whether a receiver should be appointed for a financial company:, ¬ß 203(a)(1) * In General‚ÄîFDIC and/or the Federal Reserve * Broker Dealers‚ÄîSEC and/or the Federal Reserve * Insurance Companies‚Äî Federal Insurance Office (part of the Treasury Department and established in this Act) and/or the Federal Reserve Provided that the secretary of treasury, in consultation with the president, may also determine to appoint a receiver for a financial company., ¬ß 203(b) Also, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall review and report to Congress about the secretary's decision., ¬ß 203(c)(5) When a financial institution is placed into receivership under these provisions, within 24 hours, the secretary shall report to Congress. Also, within 60 days, there shall be a report to the general public., ¬ß 203(c) The report on recommending to place a financial company into receivership shall contain various details on the state of the company, the impact of its default on the company, and the proposed action., ¬ß 203(a)(2) =FDIC liquidation= The FDIC is the liquidator for most such financial institutions as failed banks. Unless otherwise stated, the FDIC is the liquidator for financial institutions who are not banking members (such as the SIPC) nor insurance companies (such as the FDIC). In taking action under this title, the FDIC shall comply with various requirements:, ¬ß 206 * Determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company * Ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Funds are fully paid * Ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions * Ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the corporation is appointed receiver) * Ensure that the members of the board of directors (or body performing similar functions) responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company are removed, if such members have not already been removed at the time the corporation is appointed as receiver * Not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary =Orderly Liquidation Fund= To the extent that the Act expanded the scope of financial firms that may be liquidated by the federal government, beyond the existing authorities of the FDIC and SIPC, there had to be an additional source of funds, independent of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, used in case of a non-bank or non-security financial company's liquidation. The Orderly Liquidation Fund is to be an FDIC-managed fund, to be used by the FDIC in the event of a covered financial company's liquidation, ¬ß 210(n)(1) that is not covered by FDIC or SIPC., ¬ß 210(n)(8)(A) Initially, the fund is to be capitalized over a period no shorter than five years, but no longer than 10; however, in the event the FDIC must make use of the fund before it is fully capitalized, the secretary of the treasury and the FDIC are permitted to extend the period as determined necessary. The method of capitalization is by collecting risk-based assessment fees on any \\"eligible financial company\\"‚Äîwhich is defined as \\". . . any bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.\\" The severity of the assessment fees can be adjusted on an as- needed basis (depending on economic conditions and other similar factors), and the relative size and value of a firm is to play a role in determining the fees to be assessed. The eligibility of a financial company to be subject to the fees is periodically reevaluated; or, in other words, a company that does not qualify for fees in the present will be subject to the fees in the future if it crosses the 50 billion line, or become subject to Federal Reserve scrutiny. To the extent that a covered financial company has a negative net worth and its liquidation creates an obligation to the FDIC as its liquidator, the FDIC shall charge one or more risk-based assessment such that the obligation will be paid off within 60 months of the issuance of the obligation., ¬ß 210(o)(1)(B) The assessments will be charged to any bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve. Under certain conditions, the assessment may be extended to regulated banks and other financial institutions., Office of the Whistleblower. Assessments will be implemented according to a matrix that the Financial Stability Oversight Council recommends to the FDIC. The matrix shall take into account, ¬ß 210(o)(4) * Economic conditions‚Äîhigher assessments during more favorable economic conditions * Whether the institution is ** An insured depositary institution that is a member of the FDIC ** A member of the SIPC ** An insured credit union ** An insurance company, assessed pursuant to applicable state law to cover costs of rehabilitation or liquidation * Strength of its balance sheet, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, and its leverage * Relevant market share * Potential exposure to sudden calls on liquidity precipitated by economic distress with other financial companies * The amount, maturity, volatility, and stability of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding, taking into consideration existing systems for measuring a company's risk-based capital * The stability and variety of the company's sources of funding * The company's importance as a source of credit for households, businesses, and state and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the financial system * The extent to which assets are simply managed and not owned by the financial company and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse * The amount, different categories, and concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured, contingent and noncontingent, including both on- balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities, of the financial company and its affiliates =Obligation limit and funding= When liquidating a financial company under this title (as opposed to FDIC or SIPD) there is a maximum limit of the government's liquidation obligation, i.e., the government's obligation can not exceed, ¬ß 210(n)(6) * 10 percent of the total consolidated assets, or * 90 percent of the fair value of the total consolidated assets In the event that the Fund and other sources of capital are insufficient, the FDIC is authorized to buy and sell securities on behalf of the company (or companies) in receivership to raise additional capital. Taxpayers shall bear no losses from liquidating any financial company under this title, and any losses shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, recovered through assessments:, ¬ß 214 * Liquidation is required for all financial companies put into receivership under this title * All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be recovered from the disposition of assets or assessments on the financial sector =Orderly Liquidation Authority Panel= Established inside the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the panel is tasked with evaluating the conclusion of the secretary of treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default. The panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the chief judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates. If the panel concurs with the secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into receivership; if it does not concur, the secretary has an opportunity to amend and refile his or her petition. In the event that a panel decision is appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a writ of certiorari may be filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.  Title III‚ÄîTransfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the Fed  Title III, or the \\"Enhancing Financial Institution Safety and Soundness Act of 2010,\\", ¬ß 300 is designed to streamline banking regulation. It also is intended to reduce competition and overlaps between different regulators by abolishing the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferring its power over the appropriate holding companies to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, state savings associations to the FDIC, and other thrifts to the office of the Comptroller of the Currency., ¬ß 312 The thrift charter is to remain, although weakened. Additional changes include: * The amount of deposits insured by the FDIC and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) is permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000., ¬ß 335 * Each of the financial regulatory agencies represented on the Council shall establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion that shall be responsible for all matters of the agency in relation to diversity in management, employment, and business activities., ¬ß 342 Title IV‚ÄîRegulation of Advisers to Hedge Funds and Others Title IV, or the \\"Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010,\\", ¬ß 401 requires certain previously exempt investment advisers to register as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.Lemke and Lins, Regulation of Investment Advisers, ¬ß¬ß1:1, 1:31‚Äì1:32, 1:35‚Äì1:39 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Most notably, it requires many hedge fund managers and private equity fund managers to register as advisers for the first time.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance, ¬ß¬ß3:2‚Äì3:8 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Also, the act increases the reporting requirements of investment advisers as well as limiting these advisers' ability to exclude information in reporting to many of the federal government agencies. Title V‚ÄîInsurance Title V‚ÄîInsurance is split into two subtitles: A - Federal Insurance Office, and B - State-Based Insurance Reform. =Subtitle A‚ÄîFederal Insurance Office= Subtitle A, also called the \\"Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010\\",, ¬ß 501 establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department, which is tasked with:, ¬ß 502: Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of title 31, United States Code, is amended‚Äî(1) by redesignating section 312 as section 315; (2) by redesignating section 313 as section 312; and (3) by inserting: Sec 313 Federal Insurance Office * Monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (except health insurance, some long-term care insurance, and crop insurance), including the identification of gaps in regulation of insurers that could contribute to financial crisis * Monitoring the extent to which traditionally under-served communities and consumers, minorities, and low-and moderate-income persons have access to affordable insurance (except health insurance) * Making recommendations to the Financial Stability Oversight Council about insurers that may pose a risk, and to help any state regulators with national issues * Administering the Terrorism Insurance Program * Coordinating international insurance matters * Determining whether state insurance measure are preempted by covered agreements (states may have more stringent requirements) * Consulting with the states (including state insurance regulators) regarding insurance matters of national importance and prudential insurance matters of international importance; The office is headed by a director appointed for a career-reserved term by the secretary of the treasury., ¬ß 501; Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of title 31, United States Code, added Sec 313(b) Generally, the Insurance Office may require any insurer company to submit such data as may be reasonably required in carrying out the functions of the office., ¬ß 501; Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of title 31, United States Code, added Sec 313(e)(2) A state insurance measure shall be preempted if, and only to the extent that, the director determines that the measure results in a less favorable treatment of a non‚ÄìU.S. insurer whose parent corporation is located in a nation with an agreement or treaty with the United States., ¬ß 501; Subchapter I of chapter 3 of subtitle I of title 31, United States Code, added Sec 313(f) =Subtitle B‚ÄîState-Based Insurance Reform= Subtitle B, also called the \\"Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010\\", ¬ß 511 applies to nonadmitted insurance and reinsurance. Regarding to nonadmitted insurance, the Act provides that the placement of nonadmitted insurance will be subject only to the statutory and regulatory requirements of the insured's home state and that no state, other than the insured's home state, may require a surplus lines broker to be licensed to sell, solicit, or negotiate nonadmitted insurance respecting the insured.15 USC 8202(a)and (b) The Act also provides that no state, other than the insured's home state, may require any premium tax payment for nonadmitted insurance.15 USC 8201(a) However, states may enter into a compact or otherwise establish procedures to allocate among the states the premium taxes paid to an insured's home state.15 USC 8201(b) A state may not collect any fees in relation to the licensing of an individual or entity as a surplus lines broker in the state unless that state has in effect by July 21, 2012, laws or regulations providing for participation by the state in the NAIC's national insurance producer database, or any other equivalent uniform national database, for the licensure of surplus lines brokers and the renewal of these licenses.15 USC 8203 Title VI‚ÄîImprovements to Regulation President Barack Obama, flanked by Paul Volcker, left, and General Electric Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, right, during a meeting of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. =Provisions= Title VI, or the \\"Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010,\\", ¬ß 601 introduces the so-called Volcker Rule after former chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker by amending the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. With aiming to reduce the amount of speculative investments on the balance sheets of large firms, it limits banking entities to owning no more than 3 percent in a hedge fund or private equity fund of the total ownership interest. All of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3 percent of the banking entity's Tier 1 capital. Furthermore, no bank with a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund \\"may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund\\" without disclosing the relationship's full extent to the regulating entity, and ensuring that there is no conflict of interest., ¬ß 619 amends 12 U.S.C ¬ß 1841, ¬ß 13(f) \\"Banking entity\\" includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution, and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries. Also, it must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions. Responding to the Volcker Rule and anticipating of its ultimate impact, several commercial banks and investment banks operating as bank holding companies have already begun downsizing or disposing their proprietary trading desks.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance, ¬ß17:10 (Thomson West, 2103 ed.). The rule distinguishes transactions by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. The rule states that generally \\"an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any related interest of such person . . . unless the transaction is on market terms; and if the transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction.\\", ¬ß 615 Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are \\"countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction,\\" to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization., ¬ß 616 The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions., ¬ß 611 The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approving FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank either directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm., ¬ß 603 In accordance with section 1075 of the law, payment card networks must allow merchants to establish a minimum dollar amount for customers using payment cards, as long as the minimum is no higher than $10., ¬ß 1075 =Background= The Volcker Rule was first publicly endorsed by President Obama on January 21, 2010.The Real News Obama takes on Wall Street? , January 22, 2010 The final version of the Act prepared by the conference committee included a strengthened Volcker rule by containing language by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Carl Levin (D-Michigan), covering a greater range of proprietary trading than originally proposed by the administration, except notably for trading in U.S. government securities and bonds issued by government-backed entities. The rule also bans conflict-of-interest trading., ¬ß 619 The rule seeks to ensure that banking organizations are both well capitalized and well managed., ¬ß 606 The proposed draft form of the Volcker Rule was presented by regulators for public comment on October 11, 2011, with the rule due to go into effect on July 21, 2012. Title VII‚ÄîWall Street Transparency and Accountability The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization Title VII, also called the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010,, ¬ß 701 concerns regulation of over the counter swaps markets.

In regards to the Fed and what he regarded as their failure to protect consumers, Dodd voiced his opinion that \\"[...] I really want the Federal Reserve to get back to its core enterprises [...] We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure. So the idea that we're going to go back and expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform is going in the wrong way.\\" However, Dodd pointed out that the transfer of powers from the Fed to other agencies should not be construed as criticism of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, but rather that \\"[i]t's about putting together an architecture that works\\". Dodd felt it would be a ‚Äúhuge mistake‚Äù to craft the bill under the auspices of bipartisan compromise stating ‚Äú(y)ou‚Äôre given very few moments in history to make this kind of a difference, and we're trying to do that.\\" Put another way, Dodd construed the lack of Republican amendments as a sign \\"[...] that the bill is a strong one\\". Richard Shelby, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and the one who proposed the changes to the Fed governance, voiced his reasons for why he felt the changes needed to be made: \\"It's an obvious conflict of interest [...] It's basically a case where the banks are choosing or having a big voice in choosing their regulator. It's unheard of.\\" Democratic Senator Jack Reed agreed, saying \\"The whole governance and operation of the Federal Reserve has to be reviewed and should be reviewed. I don't think we can just assume, you know, business as usual.\\" Barney Frank, who in 2003 told auditors warning him of the risk caused by government subsidies in the mortgage market, \\"I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing\\" proposed his own legislative package of financial reforms in the House, did not comment on the Stability Act directly, but rather indicated that he was pleased that reform efforts were happening at all: \\"Obviously, the bills aren't going to be identical, but it confirms that we are moving in the same direction and reaffirms my confidence that we are going to be able to get an appropriate, effective reform package passed very soon.\\" During a Senate Republican press conference on April 21, 2010, Richard Shelby reported that he and Dodd were meeting \\"every day\\" and were attempting to forge a bipartisan bill. Shelby also expressed his optimism that a \\"good bill\\" will be reached, and that \\"we're closer than ever.\\" Saxby Chambliss echoed Shelby's sentiments, saying, \\"I feel exactly as Senator Shelby does about the Banking Committee negotiations,\\" but voiced his concern about maintaining an active derivatives market and not driving financial firms overseas. Kay Bailey Hutchison indicated her desire to see state banks have access to the Fed, while Orrin Hatch had concerns over transparency, and the lack of Fannie and Freddy reform. Industry and other groups Ed Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, regarded the reforms as haphazard and dangerous, saying, \\"To some degree, it looks like they're just blowing up everything for the sake of change. . . . If this were to happen, the regulatory system would be in chaos for years. You have to look at the real-world impact of this.\\" The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)‚Äîthe \\"top Wall Street lobby\\"‚Äîhas expressed support for the law, and has urged Congress not to change or repeal it in order to prevent a stronger law from passing. A survey by Rimes Technologies Corp of senior investment banking figures in the U.S. and UK showed that 86 percent expect that Dodd‚ÄìFrank will significantly increase the cost of their data operations. Big banks \\"complained for years about a key feature of the Dodd-Frank overhaul requiring them to keep billions of dollars in cash in reserves.\\" In 2019 some, such as Wells-Fargo, offered higher deposit rates to government lenders, freeing up deposits previously held to maintain the required liquid coverage ratio. Continental European scholars have also discussed the necessity of far-reaching banking reforms in light of the current crisis of confidence, recommending the adoption of binding regulations that would go further than Dodd‚ÄìFrank‚Äînotably in France where SFAF and banking experts have argued that, beyond national legislations, such rules should be adopted and implemented within the broader context of separation of powers in European Union law.. This perspective has gained ground after the unraveling of the Libor scandal in July 2012, with mainstream opinion leaders such as the Financial Times editorialists calling for the adoption of an EU-wide \\"Glass Steagall II\\". quoting FT Editorial Page.  Job creation  An editorial in the Wall Street Journal speculated that the law would make it more expensive for startups to raise capital and create new jobs; other opinion pieces suggest that such an impact would be due to a reduction in fraud or other misconduct.  Corporate governance issues and U.S. public corporations  The tier 1 ratio represents the strength of the financial cushion that a bank maintains; the higher the ratio, the stronger the financial position of the bank, other things equal. Dodd‚ÄìFrank set standards for improving this ratio and has been successful in that regard. The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act has several provisions that call upon the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement several new rules and regulations that will affect corporate governance issues surrounding public corporations in the United States. Many of the provisions put in place by Dodd‚ÄìFrank require the SEC to implement new regulations, but intentionally do not give specifics as to when regulations should be adopted or exactly what the regulations should be. This will allow the SEC to implement new regulations over several years and make adjustments as it analyzes the environment. Public companies will have to work to adopt new policies in order to adapt to the changing regulatory environment they will face over the coming years. Section 951 of Dodd‚ÄìFrank deals with executive compensation. The provisions require the SEC to implement rules that require proxy statements for shareholder meetings to include a vote for shareholders to approve executive compensation by voting on \\"say on pay\\" and \\"golden parachutes.\\" SEC regulations require that at least once every three years shareholders have a non-binding say-on-pay vote on executive compensation. While shareholders are required to have a say-on-pay vote at least every three years, they can also elect to vote annually, every two years, or every third year. The regulations also require that shareholders have a vote at least every six years to decide how often they would like to have say-on-pay votes. In addition, companies are required to disclose any golden parachute compensation that may be paid out to executives in the case of a merger, acquisition, or sale of major assets. Proxy statements must also give shareholders the chance to cast a non-binding vote to approve golden parachute policies. Although these votes are non-binding and do not take precedence over the decisions of the board, failure to give the results of votes due consideration can cause negative shareholder reactions. Regulations covering these requirements were implemented in January 2011 and took effect in April 2011. Section 952 of Dodd‚ÄìFrank deals with independent compensation committees as well as their advisors and legal teams. These provisions require the SEC to make national stock exchanges set standards for the compensation committees of publicly traded companies listed on these exchanges. Under these standards national stock exchanges are prohibited from listing public companies that do not have an independent compensation committee. To insure that compensation committees remain independent, the SEC is required to identify any areas that may create a potential conflict of interest and work to define exactly what requirements must be met for the committee to be considered independent. Some of the areas examined for conflicts of interest include other services provided by advisors, personal relationships between advisors and shareholders, advisor fees as a percentage of their company's revenue, and advisors' stock holdings. These provisions also cover advisors and legal teams serving compensation committees by requiring proxy statements to disclose any compensation consultants and include a review of each to ensure no conflicts of interest exist. Compensation committees are fully responsible for selecting advisors and determining their compensation. Final regulations covering issues surrounding compensation committees were implemented in June 2012 by the SEC and took effect in July 2012. Under these regulations the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ also added their own rules regarding the retention of committee advisors. These regulations were approved by the SEC in 2013 and took full effect in early 2014. Section 953 of Dodd‚ÄìFrank deals with pay for performance policies to determine executive compensation. Provisions from this section require the SEC to make regulations regarding the disclosure of executive compensation as well as regulations on how executive compensation is determined. New regulations require that compensation paid to executives be directly linked to financial performance including consideration of any changes in the value of the company's stock price or value of dividends paid out. The compensation of executives and the financial performance justifying it are both required to be disclosed. In addition, regulations require that CEO compensation be disclosed alongside the median employee compensation excluding CEO compensation, along with ratios comparing levels of compensation between the two. Regulations regarding pay for performance were proposed by the SEC in September 2013 and were adopted in August 2015. Section 954 of Dodd‚ÄìFrank deals with clawback of compensation policies, which work to ensure that executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting. These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have clawback policies. These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, in the case of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with reporting requirements. If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement. The SEC proposed regulations dealing with clawback of compensation in July 2015. Section 955 of Dodd‚ÄìFrank deals with employees' and directors' hedging practices. These provisions stipulate that the SEC must implement rules requiring public companies to disclose in proxy statements whether or not employees and directors of the company are permitted to hold a short position on any equity shares of the company. This applies to both employees and directors who are compensated with company stock as well as those who are simply owners of company stock. The SEC proposed rules regarding hedging in February 2015. Section 957 deals with broker voting and relates to section 951 dealing with executive compensation. While section 951 requires say on pay and golden parachute votes from shareholders, section 957 requires national exchanges to prohibit brokers from voting on executive compensation. In addition, the provisions in this section prevent brokers from voting on any major corporate governance issue as determined by the SEC including the election of board members. This gives shareholders more influence on important issues since brokers tend to vote shares in favor of executives. Brokers may only vote shares if they are directly instructed to do so by shareholders associated with the shares. The SEC approved the listing rules set forth by the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding provisions from section 957 in September 2010. Additional provisions set forth by Dodd‚ÄìFrank in section 972 require public companies to disclose in proxy statements reasons for why the current CEO and chairman of the board hold their positions. The same rule applies to new appointments for CEO or chairman of the board. Public companies must find reasons supporting their decisions to retain an existing chairman of the board or CEO or reasons for selecting new ones to keep shareholders informed. Provisions from Dodd‚ÄìFrank found in section 922 also address whistle blower protection. Under new regulations any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can be rewarded with substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected. Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars. These provisions also enact anti- retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers the right to have a jury trial if they feel they have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing. If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees. This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations. The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011. Section 971 of Dodd‚ÄìFrank deals with proxy access and shareholders' ability to nominate candidates for director positions in public companies. Provisions in the section allow shareholders to use proxy materials to contact and form groups with other shareholders in order to nominate new potential directors. In the past, activist investors had to pay to have materials prepared and mailed to other investors in order to solicit their help on issues. Any shareholder group that has held at least three percent of voting shares for a period of at least three years is entitled to make director nominations. However, shareholder groups may not nominate more than twenty five percent of a company's board and may always nominate at least one member even if that one nomination would represent over twenty five percent of the board. If multiple shareholder groups make nominations then the nominations from groups with the most voting power will be considered first with additional nominations being considered up to the twenty five percent cap.  Constitutional challenge to Dodd‚ÄìFrank  On July 12, 2012, the Competitive Enterprise Institute joined the State National Bank of Big Spring, Texas, and the 60 Plus Association as plaintiffs in a lawsuitState National Bank of Big Spring v. Geithner (later retitled State National Bank of Big Spring, et al. v. Lew), no. 12-01032 (D.D.C, filed July 12, 2012); (complaint) filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionality of provisions of Dodd‚ÄìFrank. The complaint asked the court to invalidate the law, arguing that it gives the federal government unprecedented, unchecked power. The lawsuit was amended on September 20, 2012, to include the states of Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Michigan as plaintiffs. The states asked the court to review the constitutionality of the Orderly Liquidation Authority established under Title II of Dodd‚ÄìFrank. In February 2013 Kansas attorney general Derek Schmidt announced that Kansas along with Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Michigan, Montana, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia would join the lawsuit. The second amended complaint included those new states as plaintiffs. On August 1, 2013, U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing.State National Bank of Big Spring, et al. v. Lew , no. 12-01032 (D.D.C, August 1, 2013); (order) In July 2015, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the bank, but not the states that later joined the lawsuit, had standing to challenge the law, and returned the case to Huvelle for further proceedings.State National Bank of Big Spring, et al. v. Lew , no. 13-5247 (D.C. Cir, July 24, 2015). On January 14, 2019, the Supreme Court refused to review the District of Columbia Circuit's decision to dismiss their challenge to the constitutionality of the CFPB's structure as an \\"independent\\" agency.  Impact  Congressional Budget Office On April 21, 2010, the CBO released a cost-estimate of enacting the legislation. In its introduction, the CBO briefly discussed the legislation and then went on to generally state that it is unable to assess the cost of financial crises under current law, and added that estimating the cost of similar crises under this legislation (or other proposed ideas) is equally (and inherently) difficult: \\"[...] CBO has not determined whether the estimated costs under the Act would be smaller or larger than the costs of alternative approaches to addressing future financial crises and the risks they pose to the economy as a whole.\\" In terms of the impact on the federal budget, the CBO estimates that deficits would reduce between 2011‚Äì2020, in part due to the risk-based assessment fees levied to initially capitalize the Orderly Liquidation Fund; after which, a growing amount of revenue for the Fund would be derived from interest payments (which are not counted as budgetary receipts, and therefore do not affect the federal deficit, having the effect of negatively impacting budget figures related to the Fund). As such, the CBO projects that eventually the money being paid into the Fund (in the form of fees) would be exceeded by the expenses of the Fund itself. The cost estimate also raises questions about the time-frame of capitalizing the Fund ‚Äì their estimate took the projected value of fees collected for the Fund (and interest collected on the Fund) weighed against the expected expense of having to deal with corporate default(s) until 2020. Their conclusion was it would take longer than 10 years to fully capitalize the Fund (at which point they estimated it would be approximately 45 billion), although no specifics beyond that were expressed. The projection was a $5 billion or more deficit increase in at least one of the four consecutive ten-year periods starting in 2021. Effects on small banks Associated Press reported that in response to the costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking.Say goodbye to traditional free checking , Associated Press, October 25, 2010 Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk.Heritage Foundation. Dodd‚ÄìFrank Mortgage Rules Unleash Predatory Regulators December 16, 2013 One study has shown that smaller banks have been hurt by the regulations of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best and very likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions. Complying with the statute seems to have resulted in job shifting or job creation in the business of fulfilling reporting requirements, while making it more difficult to fire employees who report criminal violations. Opponents of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Law believe that it will affect job creation, in a sense that because of stricter regulation unemployment will increase significantly. However, the Office of Management and Budget attempts to \\"monetize\\" benefits versus costs to prove the contrary. The result is a positive relationship where benefits exceed costs: \\"During a 10-year period OMB reviewed 106 major regulations for which cost and benefit data were available [...] $136 billion to $651 billion in annual benefits versus $44 billion to $62 billion in annual costs\\" (Shapiro and Irons, 2011, p. 8).  Scholarly views  According to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen in August 2017, \\"The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.\\" Some experts have argued that Dodd‚ÄìFrank does not protect consumers adequately and does not end too big to fail. Law professor and bankruptcy expert David Skeel concluded that the law has two major themes: \\"government partnership with the largest Wall Street banks and financial institutions\\" and \\"a system of ad hoc interventions by regulators that are divorced from basic rule-of-law constraints\\". While he states that \\"the overall pattern of the legislation is disturbing\\", he also concludes that some are clearly helpful, such as the derivatives exchanges and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Skeel, David 2010. The New Financial Deal: Understanding the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act and Its (Unintended) Consequences . Hoboken NJ: John Wiley & Sons. Regarding the Republican-led rollback of some provisions of Dodd-Frank in 2018, this move from increased regulation after a crisis to deregulation during an economic boom has been a recurrent feature in the United States. Whistleblower-driven settlements The SEC's 2017 annual report on the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program stated: \\"Since the program‚Äôs inception, the SEC has ordered wrongdoers in enforcement matters involving whistleblower information to pay over $975 million in total monetary sanctions, including more than $671 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and interest, the majority of which has been...returned to harmed investors.\\" Whistleblowers receive 10‚Äì30% of this amount under the Act. A decade after it was created, the SEC whistleblower program has enabled the SEC to take enforcement actions resulting in over $2.5 billion in financial remedies and putting about $500 million in the pockets of defrauded investors. In addition, the incentives have generated more than 33,300 tips.

Fingov's works range from private houses though schools and public buildings to royal palaces and hunting lodges for the Bulgarian Royal Family. Fingov was born in Kalofer (at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, now in central Bulgaria) to the family of Dimitar Fingov, a Kyiv and Moscow- educated polyglot teacher who was an acquaintance of Hristo Botev and Ivan Vazov. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Georgi Fingov's father was briefly governor of Targovishte, Botevgrad and Pleven. In 1892, Georgi Fingov graduated from the Plovdiv high school and moved to Vienna, Austria‚ÄìHungary, to study architecture at what is today the Vienna University of Technology. As a student, Fingov was an assistant of Karl Mayreder at the university and worked in the prominent Austrian architect's studio. Leaving behind prospects of a successful career in Vienna, in 1898 Fingov returned to Bulgaria. In Plovdiv, he established a studio together with the local architect Valkovich. Together, the two designed the building of the Plovdiv French College for Girls. Fingov's separate works in Plovdiv include the Neo-Gothic Protestant church in the city and several residential buildings. Fingov moved to Sofia, the capital of the Principality of Bulgaria, in 1902. He quickly became the head of the Sofia Municipality department of architecture, where he succeeded Friedrich Gr√ºnanger. Fingov was also in charge of royal palaces as a Ministry of Public Works official. He designed the Sitnyakovo mountain lodge and the Tsarska Bistritsa royal hunting lodge, both in Rila, and the smaller of the two palaces at Vrana near Sofia. Fingov also reconstructed the Saint Demetrius Monastery at Euxinograd by Varna. In 1905, Fingov left the Ministry of Public Works to start a private career, which lasted until 1936. As a private architect, Fingov collaborated with several other Bulgarian architects, including Kiro Marichkov, Dimo Nichev, Nikola Yurukov and Georgi Apostolov. Georgi Fingov was killed in 1944 during the bombing of Sofia in World War II. Fingov's son, Dimitar Fingov, was also an architect. His granddaughter (daughter of his daughter Milka M√ºller n√©e Fingova), Barbara M√ºller, is an actress and translator from German to Bulgarian.

The manga was published in Japan by Shinshokan, running in Wings magazine between September 26, 2002, and October 26, 2004.

Comi.http://www.gocomi.com/index.php?module=manga‚äÇ=series_detail‚´ï=volumes&s;_id=9&v;_id=43 Summary As a child, Rion saw an uncensored tape that showed demons possessing little boys who would later grow up to be demons and attack young girls. From then on she was convinced that young boys were angels who would turn into villainous devils when they got older. Now that Rion has grown into a pretty young girl, she only has eyes for little boys and avoids ‚Äúdevils‚Äù at all costs. She even goes to an all-girl school in order to avoid men. The manga starts as her father ‚Äì ‚Äúthe big devil‚Äù ‚Äì is coming home from being out of town. Rion goes to buy groceries for dinner and on her way home she is attacked by a scruffy-looking vagrant who is demanding food. Luckily, a handsome man stops the attack, but Rion thinks it‚Äôs a ruse perpetrated by the two of them to get to her. So she runs home and hurries to the elevator, but a man jumps in the elevator with her. So she runs away from him and takes the stairs all the way to the top of the complex, but on the way she runs into a gorgeous young boy named Tenshi who looks exactly like her first love. She falls for him instantly, but he seems uninterested. When Rion makes it to her room, the scruffy vagrant, the handsome do-gooder, and the man from the elevator are all there waiting for her! It turns out that Rion‚Äôs father gathered them all together and they are all now her fiance. And over the next few days she is supposed to choose one of them to marry, whether she likes it or not. Now all she wants to do is be with Tenshi, but these beautiful men keep throwing themselves at her. It certainly doesn‚Äôt help when the big devil gives all of them a key to her room so they can drop by whenever they want. Oh, what is a girl to do? Characters Rion Ryuzaki A beautiful, hot- tempered girl traumatized by a glimpse of an adult video when she was younger, Rion is terrified of men. Much to the disappointment of all the boys her age, she only likes younger guys. After her adopted father arranged her to pick three boys as her fianc√©, Rion slowly begins to open up to them. She falls in love with Tenshi Kogai, a young, so to seem, boy living in the same building she lives in. Soon, Rion learns that she made a contract with her adopted father, who was part of a clan of Devils that cannot bear children, injecting Devil DNA into her bloodstream. The devil part of her, goes to sleep within Rion until her sixteenth birthday draws near. Rion's other persona is more seductive and aggressive than the real Rion, along with her cat-slits eyes. After Tenshi lashed out at her, thinking that he was stuck in his child form because of her, Rion went to confront her father. In an agreement, Rion was to have sex with one of her fianc√©s, he will returned Tenshi back to his true self. Scared, Rion told Tenshi what happened and then went off to ask Somi, one of her fianc√©s, to sleep with her. Before anything could happen, Tenshi broke it up, and ask Rion to come back to him. Soon, the memories from his past restored him back to his original self. Somi still intended to bed with Rion and the two boys got into a fight. After trying to figure out how to cure them of the Devil and Angels DNA, Rion concluded that the only way to achieve this, was to have sex with one of them. Not wanting Rion to waste her first time of one of fianc√©s, he dragged Rion to the room to sleep with her. Rion blacked out and her other persona took over. Tenshi managed to switched Rion back to her old self after telling the Devil Rion that he would still sleep with her because Rion is still Rion and frightening the real Rion, they figured out to stop the shifts in her and her fianc√©s was to have someone they love talk them back to themselves. Hoping her fianc√©s would give up on her after learning this, Somi, Fuuya, and Koki was even more determined to win her over, much to her and Tenshi's dismay. Tenshi Kogai Tenshi is a foul-mouthed, cigarette-smoking boy that takes the appearance of a young boy in the few first chapters. He is Rion's main love interest. Before the beginning of the story, Tenshi was raised in an orphanage called \\"Engaoka\\", along with Rion. Though at a young age, the two fell in love. However, a family came one day to adopt him and he left the orphanage, breaking Rion's heart. After years, he learned where Rion lives, and went to see her, hoping to preclaim his love for her. However, along the way, he met Rion's adopted father. Realizing that Tenshi would get in the way, Rion's father erased all of Tenshi's memories of her and cursed him into his child form. Believing to be a disease, Tenshi's family resented him and he was forced to live by himself. When he first met Rion, having no memories of her from the past, he thought she was an annoying, stupid girl. After Rion could see his true, adult form, Tenshi believes that Rion holds the key for his \\"disease\\" and soon began to date her, not caring that she was forced to pick a fianc√©. Later in the chapters, Tenshi realizies that he and Rion grew up together in the same orphanage after seeing a picture of Rion as a little girl and a boy that resembles himself. After confirming that the boy was him, Tenshi lashed out at Rion, blaming her for everything that happened. After Rion explains that it was her father who trapped him in his child form and that Rion's father would change him back if she would sleep with one of her fianc√©s, Tenshi was shaken with guilt and went to stop her. Later, he figured out that to stop the shifts in Rion and her fianc√© was to have someone they love talk them out of it after he almost had sex with Rion. Hoping that would let Rion and himself be together, her fianc√©s were even more determined to win her heart, much to his dismay. But he truly loves Rion and they both want to be each other's first time. Koki Sendo Koki is one of Rion's three fianc√©s, along with his adopted brothers, Somi and Fuuya. Koki is definitely the most aggressive and gluttonious of the trio. Before the story took place, Koki wanted for money, so he made a blood contract his adopted father, an Angel. When Koki shifts into his other persona he becomes an aggressive womanizer and finds himself always broke. He first encounters Rion when she was on her way from school, filthy and hungry. Thinking he was a pervert, she tried to get away from him until his brother Somi arrived and Rion got away. They met again when he and his brothers were properly introduced to her by Rion's father. That same night, he tried to convince Rion to pick him, knowing how much she hates him and his brothers. It was then when he proved to Rion that he and his brothers weren't \\"devils\\": they revealed their angel's wings to Rion, who ran out of the room crying and scared. After Rion witnesses Somi's sadistic other side, he comforts her and tells her about the Devil blood that runs through her. She did not believe him until he flew into the air and let her fall, letting that way her Devil's wings emerge from her back. After she fainted, he carried her back to her room. Later, he skipped school one day and locked himself in his room, trying to suppress his other side. Rion came home, bringing Tenshi with her, and the two boys got into a fight. Afterwards, he left and told that Tenshi \\"reeks of Devil\\". After Tenshi lashed out at Rion, blaming her for trapping him in his child form, Koki gives Rion some advice to confront her father if she wants to know what happened with Tenshi. After Rion's agreement with her father that he will change Tenshi back to his true form if she sleeps with one of her fianc√©s, Koki was not the one she picked, because she was scared of his aggressiveness. He was seen again with his brothers when Rion and Tenshi tried to come up with a way to free him and his brothers from the Angel DNA. Seeing how to keep them from shifting by having someone they love talk them back to normal, Koki, along with his brothers, was more determined to win Rion's heart. Fuuya Sendo Fuuya is a model and delighted by many women. But when modeling he is usually in his other Persona, and doesn't enjoy his job that much. In fact, it would sometimes depress him. Especially when the pheremones released sex crazed men and woman to attack him. Fuuya tended to look like a cute girl when he cried to Rion, and was usually the one she felt most comfortable around. When Fuuya hangs out with Rion they act as friends. But Fuuya knows the only way to be human is to take Rion's virginity, and the bad part is him and his brothers are slowly growing feelings for her. Somi Sendo Somi is probably the most favorited by Rion when it comes to which one to marry. Somi is the most aggressive about not shifting to his other persona, so bad he cuts himself. He constantly denies any feelings for Rion, and only wants her body so he can become human. Throughout the manga, Somi shifts in front of Rion and becomes pretty aggressive usually, but hates himself after. He seems to usually be the head of the group and most sophisticated. And his enemy? Tenshi, because Rion loves him, and every time Somi might get to do her, Tenshi comes in and saves the day. Or destroys it in Somi's case. Even though he won't admit it out loud, he has growing feelings for Rion that soon he won't be able to hide under that blank smirk.

Biography William Armstrong was the son of the Christie Armstrong referred to in the ballad of Johnnie Armstrong as \\"Kristy my son\\", and inherited Gilnockie Tower. Having been imprisoned in the Tolbooth, Jedburgh, for stealing two colts during a marauding expedition, he received his release through the interposition of the Earl of Traquair, lord high treasurer, and henceforth became devoted heart and soul to the earl's interests. Some time afterwards a lawsuit, in which the Earl of Traquair was a party, was on for trial in the Court of Session, Edinburgh. The decision, it was supposed, would turn on the opinion of the presiding judge, Sir Alexander Gibson, Lord Durie I (who took the name as his judicial title when he bought the Durie land from the family of that name). He was known to be unfavourable to Lord Traquair. Armstrong, therefore, kidnapped the judge at Leith Sands, where he was taking his usual exercise on horseback, and conveyed him blindfold to an old castle, the tower of Graham, on the Dryfe Water, near Moffat. The judge's friends mourned for him as dead, the belief being that his horse had thrown him into the sea; but after the case was settled he was again conveyed blindfold to Leith Sands, whence he made his way home three months later than his horse. As Lord Durie was twice chosen president of the court, namely, for the summer session of 1642, and for the winter session of 1643, his capture must have taken place in one of these years. Armstrong is said also to have been employed by Traquair, during the English Civil War, in conveying a packet to the king, and on his return to have made his escape at Carlisle from the pursuit of Cromwell's soldiers by springing his horse over the parapet of the bridge that crosses the Eden, which was then in flood. It is not impossible that the tombstone discovered in the churchyard of Sark, supposed at one time to be that of \\"Kinmont Willie\\", may really commemorate Christie's Will. The William Armstrong to whom it refers died in 1658 at the age of 56. William Armstrong (Christie's Will) came over to Co Fermanagh (Northern) Ireland in the early 1600s. He settled near Brookeborough in Maguire's Bridge where begot several sons. He died in the Battle of Benburb 6 June 1646 and is buried in Northern Ireland. He has many descendants in Northern Ireland to this day. In literature The ballad of Christie's Will, published by Sir Walter Scott in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border is, according to Scott, not to be regarded as of genuine and unmixed antiquity.

He was a member of the Seattle City Council from 2007 to 2017, and served as Mayor of Seattle for 71 days in late 2017. Prior to his political career, Burgess was a radio journalist and Seattle Police Department officer. Burgess was appointed as mayor by the city council on September 18, 2017, to serve the remaining term of Ed Murray, who resigned amid a sexual abuse scandal. Burgess replaced the acting mayor, Council President Bruce Harrell, and served as mayor until the 2017 mayoral election results were certified on November 28.

He was elected Council President by his colleagues for 2014‚Äì2015 and was also co-chair of the City's Family and Education Levy Oversight Committee. Prior to his election to the City Council, Burgess chaired his neighborhood community council and served 12 years on Seattle's Ethics and Elections Commission. Early life and career Burgess was born to a working class, Christian family in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, the youngest of three brothers. He described his family as \\"very poor\\", and their home was foreclosed when Burgess was 12 years old, moving into a rented home in Eastlake. Burgess graduated from Lincoln High School in Wallingford in 1967 and attended classes at North Seattle Community College before transferring to the University of Washington. He volunteered for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater during his youth, and was part of his middle school's Republican club. Burgess joined radio station KJR in the news department while in college, covering issues related to the Seattle Police Department, including corruption trials in county courts. He worked alongside with future councilmember and mayor Norm Rice and covered future county councilmember Larry Gossett during his time with the local Black Panthers. After the election of mayor Wes Uhlman in 1970, Burgess left radio journalism and joined the Seattle Police Department as a police officer, seeking to be part of Uhlman's plans for reform. He dropped out of the University of Washington, eight credits short of a bachelor's degree in political science, due to a shift change. Burgess partrolled in the High Point neighborhood of West Seattle for two years, in what he described as an \\"eye-opening\\" experience seeing \\"the effects of violence, injustice, [and] poverty\\". He moved to the police department's public relations arm in 1972, eventually serving as the press aid to Police Chief Robert Hanson from 1974 to 1978. While with the police department, Burgess also served as a burglary detective. He left the police department in 1978 for World Concern, a Seattle-based Christian humanitarian organization working on anti-poverty initiatives, to work as a communications and public relations manager. Burgess returned to Seattle in 1985 and started an advertising agency, Seattle, Burgess & Associates (later, The Domain Group), which he ran until selling the agency to Merkle in 2005. The company had an annual revenue of $70 million and more than 200 employees at the time of its sale. Political career Councilman Burgess in 2015 Burgess chaired the Queen Anne Community Council in the 1990s and served on the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission from 1989 to 2001, chairing the commission for five years. Burgess publicly criticized city councilmembers for their ties to organized crime and campaign-finance violations during the Strippergate scandal of 2003, taking a leading role in calling for accountability in his position as former ethics commissioner. Burgess began considering a run for the Seattle City Council in late 2006, while on a bike trip in Italy during his retirement. He announced his candidacy in January 2007, intending to run against one-term incumbent David Della. Burgess was the only challenger to Della, advancing automatically to the November general election. Burgess was criticized by Della for his advertisement agency's work for a conservative Christian group that opposes abortion and gay marriage, despite Burgess's personal beliefs. Burgess received the endorsement of The Seattle Times, along with several state and local politicians, and ultimately won in the election with 64 percent of votes. The race for Position 8 was the most expensive in city council history, with Burgess raising $64,000 of his $293,000 using his own money. Burgess was sworn in as a new councilmember in January 2008 and was elected to chair the Public Safety, Human Services and Education Committee. Burgess was re-elected by 83 percent of voters in the November 2011 election, defeating architect David Schraer. Burgess ran for mayor in the 2013 mayoral election, looking to unseat incumbent Mike McGinn, but dropped out before the primary filing deadline. He endorsed Ed Murray, who later was elected mayor. Burgess was named Council President from 2014 to 2015. He was elected to a third term in 2015, defeating Jon Grant with over 60 percent of votes. Burgess announced that he would not seek re-election in 2017, as he was one of the most senior councilmembers and sought to step aside and \\"move on\\". After the resignation of Mayor Ed Murray on September 13, 2017, Burgess was named as a leading candidate to become interim mayor until November. Council President and acting mayor Bruce Harrell declined to continue the term, and Burgess was elected to the role of mayor in a 5‚Äì1 vote of the city council on September 18, 2017. His 71-day term as mayor, which he described as \\"accidental\\", included the signing of the 2018 budget. After the certification of the 2017 mayoral election results on November 28, 2017, Jenny Durkan became mayor. Personal life Burgess married his wife Joleen, a former editor at the Seattle Post- Intelligencer, in 1979. They have three daughters and live on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle. Burgess is a Christian and attends church at a Presbyterian church on Queen Anne Hill on a weekly basis. He described his faith in 2012 to The Stranger as being \\"absolutely anchored to forgiveness and grace\\". He identified as a Republican early in his life, but later became a Democrat over his personal values.

These side-effects influence the reaction mechanisms, as well as the chemical kinetics of corrosion and metal deposition.. In a reaction we can displace the bonding electrons by attacking reagents. The electronic displacement in turn may be due to certain effects, some of which are permanent (inductive and mesomeric effects), and the others are temporary (electromeric effect). Those effects which are permanently operating in the molecule are known as polarization effects, and those effects which are brought into play by attacking reagent (and as the attacking reagent is removed, the electronic displacement disappears) are known as polarisability effects. The term 'polarization' derives from the early 19th-century discovery that electrolysis causes the elements in an electrolyte to be attracted towards one or the other pole i.e. the gasses were polarized towards the electrodes. Thus, initially 'polarization' was essentially a description of electrolysis itself, and in the context of electrochemical cells used to describe the effects on the electrolyte (which was then called \\"polarization liquid\\"). In time, as more electrochemical processes were invented, the term 'polarization' evolved to denote any (potentially undesirable) mechanical side-effects that occur at the interface between electrolyte and electrodes. These mechanical side-effects are: * activation polarization: the accumulation of gasses (or other non- reagent products) at the interface between electrode and electrolyte. * concentration polarization: uneven depletion of reagents in the electrolyte cause concentration gradients in boundary layers. Both effects isolate the electrode from the electrolyte, impeding reaction and charge transfer between the two. The immediate consequences of these barriers are: * the reduction potential decreases, the reaction rate slows and eventually halts. * electric current is increasingly converted into heat rather than into desired electrochemical work. * as predicted by Ohm's law, either electromotive force decreases and current increases, or vice versa. * the self-discharge rate increases in electrochemical cells. Each of these immediate consequences has multiple secondary effects. For instance, heat affects the crystalline structure of the electrode material. This in turn can influence reaction rate, and/or accelerate dendrite formation, and/or deform the plates, and/or precipitate thermal runaway. The mechanical side-effects can be desirable in some electrochemical processes, for example, certain types of electropolishing and electroplating take advantage of the fact that evolved gasses will first accumulate in the depressions of the plate. This feature can be used to reduce current in the depressions, and exposes ridges and edges to higher currents. Undesirable polarization can be suppressed by vigorous agitation of the electrolyte, or when agitation is impractical (such as in a stationary battery) with a depolarizer.

The sect remained active in the North of England until the 1660s. Its most notable leader was Roger Brearley (or Brereley). Grindletonian beliefs were Antinomian. History Grindleton in May 2007 John Wilson, who led the congregation at Kildwick before Grindletonianism appeared, has been called a religious radical and may have introduced some of the basic concepts of the sect. The community may therefore have held some Grindletonian beliefs before Brearley arrived. Brearley, who was the curate at Grindleton from 1615 to 1622, was the main leader of the Grindletonians. John Everard (c. 1584‚Äì1641) was a friend of Brearley's and may have influenced him. Brearley had a local following, attracting worshippers from the nearby parish of Giggleswick, but became more widely known after the proceedings against him. He was brought before the High Commission of the Archdiocese of York in October 1616 to answer charges that he was a radical nonconformist, that he relied on the motion of the spirit and that he thought that all doubt about salvation could be removed from believers. He was also asked to reject fifty erroneous beliefs that he and his followers allegedly held. Brearley seems to have renounced his views and to have promised to conform in future, presumably in order to escape punishment. Brearley left Grindleton in 1634 to teach at Kildwick, twenty miles away. His successor as curate at Grindleton, John Webster (1610-1683), taught ideas similar to Brearley's, and Grindletonianism continued to grow between 1615 and 1640, gaining a large number of followers in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and spinning off other antinomian sects. In 1635 John Webster, curate at Kildwick, was brought before a church court charged with being a Grindletonian. A preacher named Robert Towne carried the Grindletonian message into western Yorkshire and eastern Lancashire in the 1640s. The last known Grindletonian died in the 1680s. Beliefs In a sermon preached at Paul's Cross on 11 February 1627, and published under the title The White Wolfe in 1627, Stephen Denison, minister of St. Catherine Cree, charged the \\"Gringltonian (sic) familists\\" with adhering nine points of antinomian tendency. These nine points were repeated from Denison by Ephraim Pagitt in his Heresiography (2nd edition, 1645), and glanced at by Alexander Ross in his Pansebeia (2nd edition 1655). Some of Brearley's ideas were probably drawn from the Theologia Germanica. His teachings were Antinomian. He thought that the power of God's Spirit alone is sufficient to bring a person to salvation. Grindletonians thought that a true Christian who has the Spirit within them does not sin. The Grindletonians were close to the Familists in their beliefs. They thought the Spirit is privileged over the Letter (meaning the Bible), that anyone who has the inner light is qualified to preach, whether ordained or not, and that a person could live without sin and attain Heaven on Earth. Influences Grindleton stands at the foot of Pendle Hill, where George Fox (1624‚Äì1691), the founder of Quakerism, received the visions that convinced him to launch his sect. A number of other unorthodox sects arose in the region around the same time. It is possible that Fox was influenced by Grindletonian thinking. The Quakers Francis Howgill (1618-69) and John Camm (1605-1657) were Grindletonians who became Seekers and then Quakers. Antinomianism or Grindletonianism may also have had an influence on Anne Hutchinson (1591-1643).

The multistakeholder group states its mission is to undertake science-based initiatives for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks, reducing bycatch and promoting ecosystem health. Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) are primarily responsible for managing the world's tuna stocks‚Äîskipjack, yellowfin and albacore tuna, the species most commonly processed for canned and shelf-stable tuna products, but their parliamentary procedures too often allow the short- term economic and political interests of nations to prevent sustainable measures from being adopted. ISSF works to ensure that effective international management practices are in place to maintain the health of all the tuna stocks. While ISSF is not generally involved in the bluefin segment of the industry, which primarily supplies the sashimi market, the board has enacted a statement of concern urging the adoption of policies supporting proper management of bluefin in the Atlantic ‚Äì one of the most threatened of all tuna stocks, and they now include bluefin populations in their Status of the Stocks Reports.http://iss-foundation.org/science/status-of-the-stocks/ Purpose The ISSF provides regional fisheries management organizations with scientific recommendations to help promote tuna fishing practices that keep oceans (and tuna stocks such as skipjack tuna, albacore tuna, and yellowfin tuna) productive and healthy. In addition the ISSF helps nations combat and monitor illegal and unregulated fishing, a global problem that can damage marine ecosystems and endanger future fish stocks. Conservation Measures ISSF adopted conservation measures under its principle of governance: Work with RFMOs to achieve their objectives of conservation of tuna stocks and their ecosystems; Employ sound science for maximum sustainable yields of targeted tuna stocks; Strive to eliminate illegal, unregulated, and unreported tuna catching; Provide for the health and care of the marine ecosystem; Facilitate use of the precautionary approach; Minimize by-catch, discards, and abandoned gear; Collect and exchange data to promote better scientific understanding of tuna stocks; Support certification programs that meet the 2005 eco-labeling guidelines of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Participants The founders of ISSF are Bolton Alimentari; Bumble Bee Foods, LLC / Clover Leaf Seafoods; MW Brands; Princes Ltd.; Sea Value Co., Ltd.; StarKist Co.; Thai Union Manufacturing Co. Ltd / Chicken of the Sea Intl.; TriMarine International; and WWF, the world's leading conservation organization. In 2010, Negocios Industriales Real NIRSA S.A., FRINSA, Conservas Garavilla, S.A. and Jealsa Rianxeira S. A. joined the ISSF founders as Participating Companies. In 2011, Chotiwat Manufacturing Co., Ltd, Salica Industria Alimentaria, S.A., R.S. Cannery Co., Ltd, South Seas Tuna Corp, Sealord, Pataya Foods and Asian Alliance joined ISSF. 2012 brought Thai canner, MMP International, and Korean processor Dongwon F&B; to ISSF. Major Retailer Participation Processors, traders and importers that participate in ISSF are members of the International Seafood Sustainability Association (ISSA). Membership in ISSA is voluntary and is contingent upon compliance with ISSF conservation measures and standards of practice. In 2010, major retailers began unveiling sustainability policies that support the work of the ISSF, including Walmart and Loblaw. Practices The Status of the World Fisheries for Tuna The Foundation publishes a yearly report called The Status of the World Fisheries for Tuna which compiles the most recent science to determine the health of the 19 tuna stocks which support commercial fishing. The most recently updated version of the assessment was released in December 2012. In 2010, ISSF released its Strategic Plan with three distinct lines of approach for conservation and sustainability of tuna stocks ‚Äì applied science, advocacy and direct market action. These approaches are applied to six areas of focused effort ‚Äì managing fishing capacity, mitigating bycatch, eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, expanding data support, advancing industry performance through monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) and improving overall tuna stock health. ProActive Vessel Register ISSF's ProActive Vessel Register (PVR) was created in late 2012 and designed to provide third-party validated information on the positive steps fishing vessels take to improve responsible fishing practices. The PVR identifies which of more than 25 ISSF Commitments each vessel has adopted, including implementing strategies to increase supply chain transparency, providing complete catch data to management bodies and continuing education in best practices that reduce fishing's impact on the greater marine environment. Bigeye Tuna Recovery Efforts Prior to the annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (IATTC) in November 2010, the ISSF urged decision-makers to focus on bigeye tuna stocks rather than increasing the focus on bluefin tuna, another Atlantic species in decline. According to ICCAT's Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), bigeye tuna is on its way to recovering from an overfished state, but an increase in catches from the current level could reverse the trend. The current conservation recommendation has the total allowable catch for Atlantic bigeye at 85,000 metric tons. In 2009, the catch was slightly higher than that, and, with a recent increase in the number of vessels operating in the Atlantic, future catches could continue to exceed the scientific advice. Bycatch Mitigation Project Since 2011, ISSF has been sponsoring a series of cruises in which scientific researchers work with fishers on actual fishing excursions to find methods to mitigate bycatch and better understand how fish behave around FADs. These globally coordinated cruises have been in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and have lasted anywhere from 11 days to two and a half months. The purpose of these cruises is to gain scientific inputs to initiate improvements within the tuna purse seine fishery to reduce the environmental impact of fishing for tuna with FADs. Each cruise accomplished a series of tasks to test improved gear designs and study the behavior of tuna and non- targeted species gathering at FADs. Researchers of shark bycatch and behavior have also a primary subject of research during these cruises. In 2011 researchers lead cruises in the Eastern Pacific Ocean testing natural behavior of tuna and non-target species, conducted experiments to attract sharks away from FADs, testing alternative FAD designs and shark release best practices. In 2012 the ISSF lead research cruises in the West Indian Ocean and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean expanding on the work that was done at-sea in 2011. Skipper Workshops ISSF Bycatch Project cruises paved the way for ISSF-lead workshops held in fishing ports in the Americas, Africa, Europe and the Pacific Islands region. The workshops are modeled after a program that was designed and put into practice by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) in the eastern Pacific Ocean. As best practices are learned either through the Bycatch Project or elsewhere, some of the leading scientists and fishing experts in the world act as teachers to both fishers and policymakers in tuna fishing regions around the world. Make the Commitment Project In July 2011, the ISSF launched the Make the Commitment project, the next phase of its strategic effort to transform tuna fisheries. The global improvement plan addresses the sustainability of the three most common methods of tuna fishing: purse seine, longline, and pole & line. ‚Äú‚ÄúAdvocacy alone is insufficient, research alone is insufficient and it is not enough to simply educate...In order to improve the sustainability of tuna stocks, there must be a combination of these efforts working in tandem, with the same goal.‚Äù -Susan Jackson, President of ISSF The Make the Commitment project, which is a Global Improvement Plan for Better Practices in Tuna Fisheries, is available online, and recognizes that rather than abandoning fisheries with flaws, stakeholders should work to facilitate advancements. ISSF is calling on fishers, processors, governments and conservationists to put their strengths to work for the most commonly fished tuna species ‚Äì skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and albacore. Commitments currently in effect: ‚Ä¢ ISSF participating companies are to refrain from transactions in tuna caught by vessels on the IUU list of any tRFMO; ‚Ä¢ Vessels will provide data to tRFMO scientific bodies to support the execution of their responsibility for tuna conservation and management; ‚Ä¢ tuna products must comply with ISSF resolution 09-01, ‚ÄúIUU Fishing‚Äù, and upon discovery of a violation, a participating company will withdraw product from the market place; ‚Ä¢ credibly trace tuna products from capture to plate, including name/flag of catcher and transshipping vessels, fish species, ocean of capture, corresponding tuna RFMO area, fishing trip dates, fishing gear employed, date the company took ownership of the fish and each species by weight; ‚Ä¢ refrain from transactions in tuna caught by large-scale pelagic driftnets and ‚Ä¢ establish and publish company policy prohibiting shark-finning. Fishing Capacity Reduction The ISSF Board adopted a conservation measure to limit the growth in fishing capacity of the global large-scale tropical tuna purse seine fleet. The resolution calls on processors, traders, importers and others to refrain from transactions in skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna caught by large-scale purse seine vessels that did not exist before January 2013, unless new vessels replace existing capacity. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs ISSF commissioned a study to determine if MPAs can be put to work for the conservation of tuna stocks and found that area closure could be an effective tool but more research is needed. To further explore the issue, ISSF held a workshop with more than 30 conservation and science experts to consider if MPAs can be effectively used, and how they can be implemented. 100% Purse Seine Observer Coverage The ISSF Board adopted a conservation measure calling on processors, traders and importers to refrain from transactions with purse seine vessels that do not have an onboard observer as of January 2013. ISSF is also developing a training program to ensure that observer coverage, and subsequent data collection, is effective. ISSF also conducts ‚Äúreal world‚Äù testing of video electronic monitoring systems designed for instances where onboard human observation is not practical or as a support to live observation. FAD Management Data on fish aggregating devices, known as FADs, is currently sparse in many ocean regions. ISSF has developed an electronic FAD logbook for vessels to record usage data and electronically report that information directly to RFMO scientific bodies. The ISSF Board has called for industry participants to support only those vessels that report their FAD usage via logbooks after January 2013. This data is a necessary component of the meaningful implementation of FAD management by RFMOs, which ISSF also supports.

Concrete: Early years Concrete Marketing was founded by Bob Chiappardi and Walter O'Brien in 1984. Chiappardi was working in the mail room of Arista Records in New York whilst managing a few bands from Long Island and O'Brien was the founder of Relativity/Combat Records. The company name was chosen by plucking a name blindly from the Yellow Pages. Concrete‚Äôs first client was RCA‚Äôs Grim Reaper. It was during the group's first tour that Chiappardi and O'Brien decided to start working as a marketing company, realizing that there were few people out there to properly service the metal community. During the 1984 New Music Seminar, they distributed around 200 flyers advertising Concrete and its services and by the end of the first day they had been approached by Rick Dobbis, then VP of marketing at Chrysalis Records, and were hired to work the first full length Armoured Saint record. In 1990,, Chiappardi and O‚ÄôBrien amicably split as business partners with Chiappardi taking the helm of Concrete Marketing and several other companies they had created, whilst Walter O‚ÄôBrien took Concrete Management, the management company that looked after Pantera, White Zombie and Prong. Concrete Corner In 1992, the company began ‚ÄòConcrete Corner‚Äô, the purpose of which was the promotion and distribution of heavy metal records. This was achieved at a retail level by creating a unified sales force from the blending of independent and select chain stores that would adopt the program thus promoting select hard rock/metal/hardcore/alternative releases. The format of the program was a store within a store concept and featured point of purchase displays, instore play, sales pricing, clerk recommendations and 15,000 monthly sampler CDs. A free hard music magazine ‚ÄòConcrete Corner‚Äô was available for the consumer, while ‚ÄòNetwork Newz‚Äô provided information for the store owner. Key reasoning behind these strategies was that small retailers fared better with niche markets such as heavy metal. Occasionally for selected record launches, listening parties and midnight sales would be held the day before the release of the album proper. The first listening party and midnight sale, in which 318 of the 325 stores participated, was for a Metallica boxset. Listening parties would be advertised through instore banners, syndicated radio shows, and in magazines that featured the SoundScan hard music chart, owned by Concrete. Invitations would go out to Concrete‚Äôs 20,000 strong database of fans and stores would invite their targeted customers by mail. The program was successful in offering more to the consumer who received freebies, discounts and won raffle prizes; to the store whose staff won prizes for the best display and to the label which could be certain that their product was being pushed to their target audience. Other promotions that spun off Concrete Corner were \\"bonus disc\\" giveaways, where a bonus disc of artists from different labels was shrink wrapped to a highly anticipated new release from one of Concrete's clients. The first of these type of promotions was for Korn‚Äôs album ‚ÄòFollow the Leader‚Äô in which 100,000 copies of a compilation CD featuring tracks of breakthrough artists approved by Korn, as well as a previously unreleased Korn track were given away to each person who purchased the record. Baby band artists, at the time, featured on the first disc included Kid Rock, Powerman 5000, Orgy and Limp Bizkit. Subsequent programs like this were executed for Megadeth and Rob Zombie, among others. In 1994, a Concrete Corner Tour was also put together. The concept of the tour was to initiate monthly events in each city where the tour was routed, with the focus of the shows being more on creating an affordable, fun evening of music rather than being based specifically on recognition of the bands' names. This club tour allowed for the exposure of the bands to ticketholders who may not have seen them otherwise. Shows featured raffles and giveaways, and the first in the tour series saw Greta, Varga and Shootyz Groove take to the road. In 1998, Concrete Corner and Concrete Marketing won the ‚ÄòRelated Products and Services Supplier of the Year‚Äô award from National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), the trade organization of music retail industry. This was the first time this award was ever presented. In subsequent years, Concrete was nominated two more times. RetailVision RetailVision was a service Concrete provided which was based upon in-store video play. Concrete kept a database of 1200 stores nationwide, organized by genre in order to provide appropriate video reel compilations to each in the four genres of alternative (AlternateVision), rap (RapVision), hard rock (MetalVision) and pop music (HitVision). The appropriate video cassette was distributed to each of the stores which allowed the active consumer to see all the new hits, while at the same time let new bands reach a wider audience because of the ever- expanding record store network. With this program, Concrete could help promote 30 - 40 new bands/songs a month. Bands were selected for RetailVision via a regular weekly meeting of heavy metal fans who could vote for their favorite entries, thus helping the program maintain credibility and quality. Foundations and the Hard Music Soundscan Chart Before producing Foundations, the first exclusively heavy metal trade publication, Concrete were contributing to Friday Morning Quarterback (FMQB). By the time they had worked the first Metallica record and the second Anthrax record and were beginning to amass a lot of metal clients, they decided it was time to begin their own newsletter, and so the first issue of Foundations was distributed in January 1988. It was a bi-weekly publication that provided release information, tour itineraries and a breakdown of all Concrete's current projects, the idea behind it being that it should mimic the underground fanzines that were rife within the scene. It also featured the Concrete/Soundscan Hard Music chart. This chart was also syndicated not only in US regional publications such as Radioactive, Good Times and The Aquarian, but also in worldwide publications like Entertainment Weekly, Metal Hammer and Guitar World, reaching a combined readership of somewhere in the region of three million.

Originally from Kerala, he operated a gang active in Bombay's eastern suburbs of Ghatkopar, Tilak Nagar and Chembur. On 21 September 1983, he was shot dead by the Pathan gang because he had helped Dawood Ibrahim by instructing a gang member David Pardeshi to shoot dead Amirzada from the Pathan gang. Early years in crime Rajan lived in a slum in Ghatkopar in the east Bombay. He hails from Kerala. He worked in a small factory in Thane. With mounting expenses and greed for excess money and to get the attention of his love interest, he got into the habit of stealing branded typewriters and selling them in Chor Bazaar. Once he was accidentally arrested by a police team in search of another criminal and served imprisonment. When he was released, he took to full time crime in Ghatkopar, especially black marketing of cinema tickets, spurious liquor and extortion from shopkeepers. After a few years, a band of daring youngsters from neighbouring Tilak Nagar were released from jail. They were imprisoned on the charges of cinema ticket black marketing and beating up the police who tried to stop them. That group was led by Rajendra Nikalje alias Chhota Rajan. To increase his muscle power and clout in the area, Rajan welcomed Nikalje in his gang and they both were known as Bada Rajan (Elder Rajan) and Chhota Rajan (Younger Rajan). They soon took over most of the crime in Bombay's eastern suburbs of Ghatkopar, Pant Nagar, Chembur and Tilak Nagar. Rise in the underworld The early eighties saw a tectonic shift of power in the Mumbai underworld. Haji Mastan had virtually stopped his smuggling activities and Karim Lala was focusing more on his hotel business. The vicious Pathan gang started by Karim Lala was weakened by a split between his nephew Samad Khan on one side and Dawood Ibrahim on the other. The third don, Varadarajan Mudaliar from Dharavi moved in to extend his hold over north-east Mumbai. Bada Rajan often used his clout with Varadarajan to intimidate his victims and rivals like Abdul Kunju, Yeshwant Jadhav and Philip Pandhre. Just like his mentor, Varadarajan, Bada Rajan started the Sahyadri Krida Mandal to celebrate the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in his area. In 1982, Samad Khan and his Pathan gangsters Amirzada and Alamzeb murdered Saabir Ibrahim, elder brother of Dawood Ibrahim. Dawood plotted revenge. He offered a big supari (contract for killing) to kill Amirzada but nobody came forward. Bada Rajan saw his chance to rise in the underworld and accepted the supari. He had one of his junior gang member- an unemployed youth David Pardeshi shoot down Amirzada in the Mumbai sessions court on 6 September 1983. Murder Malayali don Abdul Kunju had a bitter and long-standing enmity with Bada Rajan. It all started when Bada Rajan sent his men to assault some youth in Shell Colony, Chembur, for harassing a woman typist. This incident developed into a deadly rivalry with Kunju. Both Kunju and Rajan had sworn to kill each other.He began supari killings ‚Äì 16 March 2002, Express India Aware of Rajan's enormous power in the areas between Ghatkopar and Matunga, Kunju realised that he could not fight the Rajan gang on his own. Therefore, he allied himself with Bada Rajan's rival, Philip Pandhare. Pandhare's gang was further strengthened when Vijay Sawant and Francis Xavier, also known as \\"Shorty\\", from Pestom Sagar enlisted with them. After Amirzada Nawab Khan was assassinated outside the sessions court premises on 6 September 1983 by Bada Rajan's hitman, David Pardesi, Kunju switched sides and allied himself with Kalia Anthony and Mahesh Dholakia of the Karim Lala gang to murder Bada Rajan. Kunju's neighbour, an autorickshaw driver named Chandrashekar Safalika, who was looking to make Rs. 5 million for his sister's wedding, was hired for the job. He was introduced to hotelier, Mahesh Dholakia at Caesar Palace. Dholakia offered around Rs. 5 million as \\"supari\\" (murder contract fee) and promised to give the entire money on successful killing of Rajan. Safalika left with only Rs. 1,00,000. The next day, Kunju provided Safalika with a revolver, and converted an isolated spot near Vikhroli Park site into a firing range. He was trained for the next 15 days by Ramesh Pujari, Mangesh More and Francis a.k.a. \\"Kaliya Anthony\\" (Blackie Anthony). In a daring operation, Safalika dressed as a naval cadet with his gun hidden in the cavity of a thick book, stalked Bada Rajan outside the Esplanade court and shot him dead. The hit was carried out on 21 September 1983, exactly 15 days after Amirzada's murder. Safalika was caught on the spot, but managed to escape while he was being escorted to the Thane prison and was killed by the rivals later (though the police claimed to have him dead). Retribution for murder The murder of Bada Rajan dealt a devastating blow to his gang. His right hand man and successor, Chhota Rajan was shattered at the loss of his mentor and swore retribution against the assassins. It was well known that Abdul Kunju was a cricket enthusiast and often managed a good-sized crowd to come and watch him play. This gave Chhota Rajan the opportunity to use Kunju's own passion against him. During one such match in 1985, as Kunju hit a boundary, three young gangsters dressed in T-shirts and sneakers, including Sanjay Raggad, Sadhu and Chhota Rajan himself, entered the arena on the pretext of retrieving the ball. After doing so, they walked right up to Kunju, pulled out their guns and shot him dead at point-blank range.'D' Company on the run? ‚Äì February 2003, Frontline Another report suggests that Chota Rajan sent Sanjay Raggad and Vijay to shoot down Kunju when he was watching a volleyball match. On spotting the two assailants, Kunju fled the match venue with the duo in pursuit. Eventually, Raggad and Vijay sprayed an array of bullets into Kunju's body that left him dead.Chhota aur Bada Rajan ‚Äì 2010 June 13, Mid-day After Kunju's death, Dolakia went back on his word and refused to deliver the remaining Rs. 4.90 million, leaving the now fugitive Safalika helpless and on his own. In desperation, he turned to the Thane-based goon Abdul Majid for help. Majid invited him over for a treat at a bar in Thane, which in actuality was owned by Sadhu. Safalika got very drunk and stayed at the bar overnight. In the meanwhile, Sadhu tipped off Chhotta Rajan to his whereabouts and Safalika was woken up at around 4 a.m. by Rajan's henchmen. He was then driven in a Fiat car to Dawood Ibrahim's younger brother, Noora's hideout at Nagpada. There he was viciously interrogated, tortured and subsequently murdered the next day. In popular culture * The 1991 Malayalam film Abhimanyu was inspired by the life of Bada Rajan; and is loosely based on his biography. In the film, Mohanlal plays a Malayali immigrant who becomes a Mumbai underworld don and is eventually shot dead.

It follows the old route of a Canadian Pacific railway from Ayer's Cliff to Stanstead. In between, it passes through parts of Stanstead-Est, Stanstead Township, and Ogden. The trail is made of a gravel surface, and is open for cyclists, hikers, and cross-country skiers. It closes for maintenance between mid-March and mid-May every two years. The trail is privately-owned and maintained by the Sentiers Massawippi nonprofit organization, which is funded by private donations, corporate partners and funds from surrounding municipalities. The trail was completely converted for touristic purposes after the removal of the railway tracks in 1992, however parts of it were already informally used by hikers for a decade prior to opening. The last Quebec Central revenue freight train to use the line was on December 5, 1988(the last Canadian Pacific train, a detour freight, ran on November 29, 1988). Wildlife and nature The trail is populated by hundreds of species and plants. Travelers often encounter wildlife including tortoises, herons, beavers, grass snakes, falcons and deer. More rarely, depending on the season, one may also encounter occasional black bears, moose, coyotes and red foxes. Trail connections To the southwest, a minor trail follows Chemin de North Derby, and terminates right across the border from North Derby. Another trail starts in North Derby and reaches Newport, but one must clear U.S. customs at either Route 247 or Route 143 in order to access it. To the southeast, another gravel trail takes cyclists to Stanstead and Stanstead Plain, ending at Rue Maple. To the north, access to other trails is difficult, and is done by Routes 208, 143, Chemin du Lac, Chemin de Hatley, Chemin de Hatley Centre, Chemin Massawippi and Rue Main to reach Sentier Massawippi, connecting North Hatley to the Lennoxville borough of Sherbrooke. Route 143 remains dangerous as it has no paved shoulder, and its maximum speed is 90 km/h. The other option is to reach Magog via Route 141, Chemin Benoit, and Route 108.

Early life Carlos Bulgheroni was born in Rufino, Santa Fe Province, to a Spanish mother and an Italian father. He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires, and earned a juris doctor in 1970. Bulgheroni developed lymphoma at age 24, but recovered. Career He joined his father Alejandro in Bridas Corporation, founded by the Bulgheroni family in 1948 and by the 1970s one of the largest private firms in the Argentine energy sector. The senior Bulgheroni died in 1985 and left a controlling stake in the firm to Carlos and his elder brother, Alejandro. Carlos Bulgheroni became the firm's chief political point man, establishing good working relationships with the various administrations in power since 1983. He was named president and chairman in 1993; president of the BP-controlled PanAmerican Energy in 1997; of Allis-Chalmers's energy unit in 2006; and of EDIC, a company specializing in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the North African, Russian, Central Asian, and Middle and Far Eastern markets.BusinessWeek: Carlos Alberto Bulgheroni Bulgheroni obtained, in 1992, some of the first gas exploration concessions granted in Turkmenistan to a foreign energy company. He was further involved during 1997 in negotiations between Bridas and the ruling Taliban faction in Afghanistan to build the Trans-Afghanistan Gas Pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan.Clar√≠n (11/8/2005) These negotiations were in competition with those undertaken by Unocal,Taleban in Texas for talks on gas pipeline (12/4/1997) and although an agreement with Unocal-led corporation CentGas was reached, the deal was forfeited in January 1998 in favor of one with Bridas.BBC: Taleban says it's ready to sign Turkmen pipeline deal (1/4/1998) Instability in Afghanistan delayed construction of the pipeline, however, and following the United States Invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the Bridas contract was rescinded in favor of the former one with Unocal. In 2006, Bulgheroni indicated interest in Bridas' involvement with the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline project, which continued to be hampered by the ongoing chaos in the Central Asian nation.Environment News Service: Afghanistan's New Pipeline Deal May Be Just Another Pipe Dream (4/17/2006) Bulgheroni is a co-founder of the Col√≥n Theatre Foundation (1978) and of the Federal District Police Foundation (1989); the latter helps maintain the Churruca Police Officers Hospital, in Buenos Aires. He is also a member of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research (FIEL), the Peres Center for Peace, the Argentine Russian Business Council, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). At CSIS, in addition to acting as a trustee, he also serves as an international councillor and a senior adviser to the Space Exploration Initiative.CSIS:Carlos Bulgheroni He previously served as co- chairman of the International Committee at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and currently serves as a member there. He is the founder and current partner of the U.S. & Argentine Caucus. He was named Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Previously, Bulgheroni served as president of the Argentine Business Council, as a member of the Business Advisory Board of the World Trade Organization in Geneva, as president and representative for Mercosur from 1990 to 2002 for the Mercosur European Business Forum, and as a member of the Executive Board of the ICC in Paris. The Bulgheroni brothers sold a 50% stake in Bridas to Chinese oil giant CNOOC in 2010 for US$3.1 billion. They retained a 20% stake in PanAmerican Energy (whose operations in Argentina had grown to become the nation's second- largest) through Bridas.

Places of Perswasion and Disswasion. Seene and Allowed (1597) was the first published book by the philosopher, statesman and jurist Francis Bacon. The Essays are written in a wide range of styles, from the plain and unadorned to the epigrammatic. They cover topics drawn from both public and private life, and in each case the essays cover their topics systematically from a number of different angles, weighing one argument against another. While the original edition included 10 essays, a much-enlarged second edition appeared in 1612 with 38. Another, under the title Essayes or Counsels, Civill and Morall, was published in 1625 with 58 essays. Translations into French and Italian appeared during Bacon's lifetime.  Critical reception  Though Bacon considered the Essays \\"but as recreation of my other studies\\", he was given high praise by his contemporaries, even to the point of crediting him with having invented the essay form. Later researches made clear the extent of Bacon's borrowings from the works of Montaigne, Aristotle and other writers, but the Essays have nevertheless remained in the highest repute. The 19th-century literary historian Henry Hallam wrote that \\"They are deeper and more discriminating than any earlier, or almost any later, work in the English language\\". The Essays stimulated Richard Whately to republish them with annotations, somewhat extensive, that Whately extrapolated from the originals.Richard Whately (1858) Bacon‚Äôs Essays with Annotations via Internet Archive  Aphorisms  Bacon's genius as a phrase-maker appears to great advantage in the later essays. In Of Boldness he wrote, \\"If the Hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the hill\\", which is the earliest known appearance of that proverb in print. The phrase \\"hostages to fortune\\" appears in the essay Of Marriage and Single Life ‚Äì again the earliest known usage. Aldous Huxley's book Jesting Pilate took its epigraph, \\"What is Truth? said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an answer\\", from Bacon's essay Of Truth. The 1999 edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations includes no fewer than 91 quotations from the Essays.

Lake Nemrut () is a freshwater crater lake in Bitlis Province, eastern Turkey. It is part of Nemrut Caldera (), a volcanic caldera atop Volcano Nemrut. The caldera is a registered natural monument and the wetland is registered as a Ramsar site of the country. Caldera The crater of Volcano Nemrut. The caldera is located west of Lake Van in the Tatvan, Ahlat and G√ºroymak districts of Bitlis Province. It is named after the biblical figure King Nimrod. The caldera is far from Tatvan, and from Ahlat. With its width of nearly , the crater of Nemrut Volcano is one of the largest calderas of the world. The western half of the crater is covered by the lake. At the summit, there are five lakes, two of them existing permanently and the others seasonal. The biggest of the lakes is Lake Nemrut in the form of crescent. It contains freshwater of colorless, odorless and drink water quality. Lake Nemrut is situated at an elevation of about above main sea level. It has an area of , and its average depth is about with a maximum depth of . Nemrut Caldera is on the youngest volcanic cone in Turkey, which is in a not-eroded state. This unique structural geomorphology make it a subject of scientific research. Biota Flora About 450 plant species were recorded in and around Nemrut Caldera, around 200 (44%) of them belonging to the region. The diversity of the flora points out to the variation of climate conditions in the past. Around 38 (8.4%) of the existing plant species are endemic. The upside down tulip, which grows here, is a world-famous flower. The climax vegetation of Nemrut Caldera forms the haired birch (Betula) and the trembling aspen (Populus tremula). Other notable plants growing around two lakes of the caldera are the trees dwarf juniper (Juniperus communis), Norway maple (Acer platanoides), European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), white willow (Salix alba), and the shrubs coinwort cotoneaster (Cotoneaster nummularius), cherry plum (Prunus divaricata), grey willow (Salix cinerea), Greek juniper (Juniperus excelsa), breaking buckthorn (Frangula alnus), alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus) and mahaleb cherry (Prunus mahaleb). Steppe-like vegetation is spread over wide areas in the caldera. Those are mainly species of milkvetch (Astragalus). Other subshrubs and herbaceous plants are prickly thrift (Acantholimon), sainfoin (Onobrychis), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), Thymus, Alyssum, sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), Salvia, Ranunculus, Silene, rabbitfoot clover (Trifolium arvense), Pimpinella, Artemisia, squarrose (Centaurea triumfettii). Reedy areas are present In the northwestern part of Lake Nemrƒ±t. Fauna The griffon vulture brood their eggs at the caldera, which earned its status of special protected area as habitat for breeding of velvet duck and golden eagle. The number of bird species decreased at Lake Nemrut, which is a stopover site for a lot of migrating birds, due to irregular and uncontrolled hunting. Currently observed animals in the region are the bird species partridge, duck, bee- eater, Armenian gull and mammals hare, fox, bear. The chamois has been extinct. Natural monument and Ramsar site The caldera was registered a natural monument in 2003. The protected area around the crater lake covers . Nemrut Caldera Natural Monument () is protected in the status of a tourist attraction, a protected area of first degree and a wetland. The government of Turkey designated the wetland of the caldera as the 14th Ramsar site of the country on April 17, 2013. It is not permitted to cut reed in the caldera and to fish in the lake, although some livestock grazing takes place around the caldera. A winter sports and ski center was established on the southern slope of the caldera in 2007. The main threat in terms of ecology is overgrazing.

Family and early life Bona was the third of six children born to Prince Thomas, Duke of Genoa and his wife Princess Isabella of Bavaria. Her father was a grandson of King Charles Albert of Sardinia. Among her siblings were Ferdinando, 3rd Duke of Genoa; Filiberto, 4th Duke of Genoa; and Eugenio, 5th Duke of Genoa. Her mother Isabella was a granddaughter of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Through her aunt Margherita of Savoy, she was a cousin of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Bona was born at Castle d'Agli√®, Piedmont. Her father had bought the eleventh-century castle shortly before his marriage with Isabella. They passed their honeymoon there. Marriage On 8 January 1921, Bona married her second cousin, Prince Konrad of Bavaria. He was the youngest son of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and Archduchess Gisela of Austria. Through his father, he was a great- grandson of Ludwig I of Bavaria, and through his mother was a grandson of Franz Joseph I of Austria. The wedding took place at Castle Agli√® in Piedmont, Italy (where she was born). It was attended by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, Crown Prince Umberto, and the Duke of Aosta, among others. The wedding is notable for being the first royal marriage between two enemy houses since World War I began and ended. It was also remarkable as a gathering of royalty representing the Houses of Habsburg, Savoy, and Wittelsbach. The couple had two children: *Princess Amalie Isabella of Bavaria (15 December 1921 in Munich ‚Äì 28 March 1985 in Milan), married on 25 August 1949 in Lugano, Count Umberto Poletti-Galimberta, Count of Assandri (21 June 1921 in Milan ‚Äì 18 February 1995 in Milan), son of Luciano Poletti and Adriana Galimberti.

They have no issue. Later life At the end of the Second World War, Prince Konrad was arrested by the French military at Hinterstein. He was brought to Lindau and temporarily interned in the hotel Bayerischer Hof, together with among others the German Crown Prince Wilhelm and the former Nazi diplomat Hans Georg von Mackensen. Princess Bona, who worked during the war as a nurse, stayed afterwards with her relatives in Savoy. She was prohibited from entering Germany and was not reunited with her family until 1947. In later years Prince Konrad worked on the Board of German automaker NSU. Bona died on 2 February 1971 in Rome. Her tomb can be found in the church of the Andechs Abbey, in Germany. Her husband Prince Konrad died on 6 September 1969.

T. McIntosh, published in the November 1957 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction. Plot summary An unnamed man has had his consciousness sent far into the future by a scientist named Joe. The story is told in the form of messages that are sent by the time traveler using a one- way communication link that exists between the time traveler and the scientist. The time traveler tells Joe that some of his predictions about time travel and the future are correct. He has arrived in the future with an established identity and is able to speak the local language. The people of the time are friendly and simply dressed. Even though he is clearly in a city, there is little sign of impressive technology. He also reports that he is attracting a fair amount of attention because the body that he now inhabits is tall, strong, handsome and athletic whereas in our time he was something of a weakling. Another observation that the time traveler makes to Joe is that the people of the future must be pretty mature, as they only need two laws: *Law #1 ‚Äì You mustn't annoy other people. *Law #2 ‚Äì And if you're other people, you mustn‚Äôt allow yourself to be annoyed too easily. As the time traveler meets people and explores his surroundings his messages to Joe begin to mention strange events where people or creatures from other times (a sabre-tooth tiger, a group of cave men, some people attending a party in 17th century England) appear for a short time and then vanish again. Eventually, the scientists of the future catch up with the time traveler and tell him that since his arrival they have detected ever increasing disturbances in time - which is the reason for the strange and anachronistic events that have been happening around him. They tell him that these disturbances are a result of the communications link that he has to Joe, back in our time ‚Äì the link is literally pulling time apart. The future scientists see a way to remove the threat by severing the link, but their solution turns out to have some rather grim repercussions for Joe...

They form a roughly rhomboidal or lozenge shape on the map with the acute angles being to north and south. It has river valleys along its boundaries to north east (Clydesdale) and south west (Nithsdale) which carry the two largest arterial routes northwards into the west side of the Central Belt of Scotland. A string of small towns have long since developed along these routes.

Etymology The is some obscurity surrounding the name Lowther. Derivation from the early Irish lothur meaning \\"a canal, a trench\\", in this sense \\"a pass between hills\\", has been suggested. North-east and south-west boundaries It is some 30 kilometres across the rhomboid as the crow flies from the town of Sanquhar just to the west of the Lowthers to the towns of Beattock and Moffat on the east and some 28 kilometres from the town of Thornhill near the southern apex to Abington near the northern one. Sanquhar and Thornhill lie on the River Nith, Moffat on the River Annan and Abington on the River Clyde. Annandale and Clydesdale taken together, form a corridor between the Lowther Hills and the Moffat Hills (which lie to the east.). This corridor between the hills carries the main route running northwards into Scotland on its west side. It carries both the west coast railway line and the M74 motorway and has been the main route north over centuries. Nithsdale to the west of the Lowthers carries both the A76 road and the rail line from Dumfries to Kilmarnock.

North-west and south-east boundaries The north west boundary of the hills runs up the Crawick Water in a north easterly direction from where the Crawick Water runs into the River Nith. This boundary follows the B740 road through Crawfordjohn and connects to the old trunk road north which was used before the M74 was built on its present route. North of the B740 the hills gradually drop out into the Central Lowlands of Scotland though Tinto is an outlier 11 kilometres north of Abington. The south east boundary of the hills is formed by the Forest of Ae which is one of the largest forestsForestry Commission Scotland in Britain at 10,000 hectares. A continuous band of trees runs, again in a north easterly direction, from Auldgirth on the River Nith (9 kilometres south of Thornhill), for some 26 kilometres till it meets the M74 motorway 10 kilometres north of Beattock.

It runs from Carronbridge on the A76 just north of Thornhill to Elvanfoot near the M74 and carries the A702 trunk road. The road passes near the village of Durisdeer en route and reaches a height of 350 metres at the top of the pass. It is the only pass enlarged by ice into a U-shaped glacial trough, hence the road has to climb up the steep side to gain the head. Mennock Pass The Mennock Pass carries the B797 which runs from the small village of Mennock on the A76 to Abington near the M74, passing through the villages of Wanlockhead and Leadhills. The B797 reaches to a height of 467 metres as it leaves Wanlockhead - which is the highest village in Scotland.Ordnance Survey MapzoneRoman Fortlet from Durisdeer Rig - Southern Uplands of Scotland. Crawick Pass Crawick Pass is the most northerly of the three passes and carries the B740 from Crawick to Crawfordjohn and on to the M74. The Crawick is the shortest of the three passes without the steep ascents and overarching hills that characterise the other two. It is also the lowest of the three reaching a maximum height of 288 metres. Ancient Passes There was another pass from Durisdeer through to Wanlockhead called the Enterkin Pass which was an old pack horse route through the hills from Dumfries to Glasgow. It has been argued by H.R.G. Inglis (1924)Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Proceedings of the Society Feb 11th 1924 ANCIENT BORDER HIGHWAYS p. 221 by Harry R G Inglis that this route was used mainly for extracting lead to the Solway coast and was never viable as a main route north because of its height. There is no road through there now though there is a track for walkers into the centre of the hills. The Enterkin Pass was the location of a 1684 Covenanter ambush of a party of Dragoons during the Killing TimeRoots WebTravel Scotland Durisdeer Hills from the A702.

The Romans built a road through from their fortlet near DurisdeerRoman Britain on a route which takes a more direct route to the head of the pass than is offered by the Dalveen Pass. Inglis calls this route Well Path and he considers this to have been on the main pilgrimage route from Edinburgh to WhithornSociety of Antiquaries of Scotland Proceedings of the Society Feb 11th 1924 ANCIENT BORDER HIGHWAYS p. 219 by Harry R G Inglis and one of the main ancient routes northwards through the Southern Uplands. Geology and Scenery of the Passes The Lowther Hills are composed of resistant Ordovician shales, heavily compressed and contorted in the Caledonian mountain-building orogeny. The headwaters of the River Nith incise them deeply on the south, as the Nith falls much more steeply (to the nearby Solway Firth) than does the Clyde on the north. The flanks of the heavily glaciated Dalveen Pass and of the deep, steep-sided Enterkin Pass are both lined with rock slope failures (large landslips and landslides), https://www.researchgate.net/project/Rock-Slope- Failure-clustering-and-sparsity-in-the-British-mountains with a deep V-shaped notch linking these passes being a probable overflow channel cut by glacial meltwaters. The original source of the Clyde is inferred to have been here, captured to the Nith by the Dalveen trough-head. Durisdeer and its Church The village of Durisdeer sits at some distance from the A702, nestling tightly into the foot of Durisdeer Hill at the bottom of the pass through the hills that the Romans used. The Duke of Buccleuch,Times on Line Obituary 5 September 2007 the largest private landowner in Britain, Buccleuch Estates owns much of the land for many miles around this area and has a castle at Drumlanrig on the west bank of the River Nith some 5 kilometres north of Thornhill.

Just to the north, there is Glenochar Bastle and FermtounArchaeology.co.UK a 17th-century settlement and fortified house. The archaeological dig which revealed this was the winner of the 1997 Pitt Rivers Award for amateur archaeologists. Also, just to the south is the source of the River ClydeInformation Britain which flows north through Lanarkshire and passes through the City of Glasgow. Where the Daer and Potrail Waters confluence, the River Clyde begins. The Daer Water has its head waters near Queensberry and it flows through Daer Reservoir before it meets the Potrail. The head waters of the Potrail are on the north east side of Durisdeer Hill. God's Treasure House in Scotland The fact that there are two villages nearly 500 metres up in a desolate hillside in the Southern Uplands of Scotland requires some explanation: because of the rich variety of minerals to be found here, this area became known as \\"God's Treasure House in Scotland\\". Notably, it has produced some of the world's purest gold (22.8 carats) which was used in the manufacture of the Scottish Crown JewelsRampant Scotland \\\\- dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. The name \\"Leadhills\\" testifies to the fact that this area was chiefly known for its lead mining; and there is a lead mining museumMuseum of Lead Mining in nearby Wanlockhead. Leadhills has the oldest subscription library in the UK (founded by miners in 1741), and was the birthplace of the 18th century poet Allan Ramsay, whose son, also Allan Ramsay, was the leading portrait painter in Britain in the mid 18th century. The Leadhills & Wanlockhead RailwayThe Leadhills and Wanlockhead Railway is a preserved former industrial narrow- gauge railway line. Hillwalking The Lowther Hills can be split into a northern and southern section. The northern section would generally be taken to mean the string of tops lying between the Dalveen Pass and the Mennock Pass and running south eastward from near Elvanfoot over Lousie Wood Law, White Law, Dun Law, Dungrain Law, Peden Head, Green Lowther, Lowther Hill, East Mount Lowther, Thirstane Hill and Steygail which dominates the steepest part of the Dalveen Pass on its northern side. Green Lowther is the highest point of the Lowther Hills area and, like Lowther Hill, has a Civil Aviation Authority aircraft tracking station on the summit. The huge white 'golf ball' on the top of Lowther Hill can be seen from many miles away in all directions. The Southern Upland Way passes over the top of Lowther Hill - the highest point of the entire routeSouthern Upland Way. The southern portion would generally be taken to mean the lower but more expansive hills which lie between the Dalveen Pass and the Forest of Ae, the highest point of which is Queensberry. Mitchellslacks, on the northern edge of the Forest Ae, and which provides access to Queensberry, along with nearby Locherben, were the homes of the Harknesses involved in the Covenanter ambush. They also offer views into the northern Lowthers, Nithsdale and Annandale. Lowther Hills from Scaw'd Law in the Durisdeer Hills.

Potrail Water (one of the principal sources of the River Clyde) rises from little burns running out of the glen leading down from Scaw'd Law in the immediate foreground. The Southern Uplands of Scotland. Snowsports The Lowther Hills are one of the birthplaces of Scottish winter sports. Curling in the Lowthers can be traced back to 1777, when the Wanlockhead Curling Society ‚Äìone of Scotland's first Curling societies- was created. Scotland's first boys' Curling club was established in Wanlockhead in 1883. The sport remained popular in the area until the 1930s. Since the 1920s skiing in the Lowther Hills has been organised intermittently by a succession of local residents as well as several non-for-profit sports clubs. Lowther Hill is home to the only ski area in the south of Scotland, and Scotland's only community-owned ski centre. Operated by Lowther Hills Ski Club, the ski centre runs three ski lifts above the villages of Leadhills and Wanlockhead for beginners and intermediate skiers.

Bayou Plaquemine promoted settlement beginning in the 18th century and helped the area economically by providing an access route between southwestern Louisiana (and thus Texas) and the Mississippi via the Atchafalaya Basin. The lock itself was designed by Colonel George Washington Goethals of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who later served as chief engineer of the construction of the Panama Canal Lock, and went on to be the Canal Zone's first governor. Plaquemine Lock was opened on April 9, 1909 after 14 years of construction. When it was built, Plaquemine Lock was the highest freshwater lift of any lock in the world. The lock initially utilized a gravity-flow principle until pumps were installed years later. The lock was closed after 52 years of service in 1961 due to increased river traffic and the demand for a larger lock, which opened thereafter in Port Allen. The Plaquemine Lock structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Today, the Gary James Hebert Memorial Lockhouse serves as an on-site museum and visitors center.

The film stars Reid Warner, Darrin Bragg, Ben Rovner, and Jelena Nik. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on May 15, 2015, by Paramount Insurge. Plot Reid, Darrin, and Ben are three close friends who attend a party together one evening. During the party, Reid inexplicably vanishes. Unable to find him, Darrin and Ben leave. While driving home on a dark, secluded road, they suddenly find Reid standing in the middle of the road, leading to them nearly running him over. Once in the car, Reid seems detached and in a daze, though nothing is made of his odd behavior. The incident causes Reid to become obsessed with aliens and, in particular, Area 51. He spends the next three months devising a plan to infiltrate Area 51 and uncover the base's secrets. However, Reid's obsession with extraterrestrial research leaves him detached from his family and even causes him to lose his job. He is joined by Darrin, Ben, and Jelena, another conspiracy theorist whose father worked at Area 51. They plan on infiltrating the military base by using signal jammers, night vision goggles, Freon-laced jumpsuits, and pills to mask their ammonia levels. Per the advice of Jelena's father, the group stalks a man they suspect is an important figure at Area 51. Reid and Darrin sneak into the man's house and steal his security badge. Ben drops the three off in the middle of the desert and waits for them to return. Reid, Darrin and Jelena successfully bypass the base's perimeter defenses and enter the complex using the security badge they had previously acquired. The three venture deeper into the base where they discover a lab containing a lifelike liquid substance and anti-gravity material. They also encounter an alien spacecraft in a hangar, which only Reid can enter and interact with. The three then reach the ‚ÄòS4‚Äô-level of Area 51, which contains the complex's most secret information and experiments. They trigger an alarm and are swarmed by guards. Darrin is separated from the two and attempts to elude the guards and a predatory alien. He narrowly escapes the alien and retreats to the base's higher levels. Reid and Jelena venture deeper into the complex and discover a cave-like structure under Area 51. They find various articles of clothing, toys, and later pods of human blood and organs. The two then stumble upon a colony of sleeping aliens. One alien awakens and chases them out of the cave and into a different section of the complex. Reid and Jelena find themselves in a white chamber. While Reid examines a series of alien symbols, Jelena is suddenly dragged away by an unseen force. He finds her in an entranced and unresponsive state. The chamber suddenly loses gravity and reveals they are inside a silver alien spacecraft. Reid's camera falls from the spacecraft and plummets to the ground. Darrin successfully escapes the complex and discovers all personnel are being evacuated from Area 51. He ventures back into the desert where he encounters Ben, who has been waiting for the three to return. Darrin frantically explains that their group was separated and urges Ben to drive away. However, their car's engine promptly dies and the camcorder captures both men being abducted from the car. In a post-credits scene, an old man, who was previously interviewed by the group, finds Reid's still-recording camcorder.

In April 2011, CBS Films hired director and actor Chris Denham to do some rewrites on Area 51. Peli filmed re-shoots in 2013. In August 2013, Jason Blum stated that the film had finished production and that Peli was \\"tinkering\\" with the film in post production. On March 14, 2015, Blum confirmed that the film was officially done and would perhaps be released on VOD. On April 6, 2015, it was reported that Blum had responded to a Twitter user who asked if he had any news on Area 51 by stating, \\"very very very soon. -JB\\". Finally, on April 23, 2015 it was announced the film would open exclusively in Alamo Drafthouse theaters and through video on demand platforms on May 15, 2015. Release Box office and sales The film was released in Alamo Drafthouse theaters exclusively for a weekend-long-run, and on video on demand platforms beginning on May 15, 2015, courtesy of Paramount Insurge and Blumhouse Tilt. The film made a total of $7,556 for its weekend long-run. Reception Area 51 garnered predominately negative reviews from critics, and holds a 14% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Brian Tallerico writing for RogerEbert.com gave the film one and half stars and mainly criticized the film's generic plot and pacing. A. A. Dowd from The A.V.

Biography  Peterfreund grew up near Tampa, Florida and graduated from Yale University in 2001 with a double major in literature and geology. She drew upon her time as a daughter of Eli to color her Secret Society Girl novels. Before becoming a novelist, she was a costume designer, book cover model and food critic. An avid traveler, Peterfreund lives with her husband and daughters near Washington, D.C.  Work   Secret Society Girl series  Peterfreund's first book, Secret Society Girl: An Ivy League Novel, details the second semester of Amy \\"Bugaboo\\" Haskell's junior year at Eli University, a thinly veiled Yale University clone, after she is tapped for Rose & Grave, a secret society that opens its ranks to women for the first time. Peterfreund used her time at Yale as the basis for Amy's Eli experience. The New York Observer described the book as \\"witty and endearing\\", and Booklist described the book as \\"frivolous but fun to read\\". Three other books were released in the series, chronicling Amy's senior year. In Under the Rose, Amy uncovers scandals that could undermine the very foundation of Rose & Grave: a fellow \\"Diggirl\\" seems to be feeding confidential information to a nonmember to bring the society down from within and several current and former male Diggers have formed an \\"old boys' club\\" offshoot of Rose & Grave. Eager to escape the wrath of a rival society on campus, Amy and the Knights are whisked off to Rose & Grave's private island off the coast of Florida in Rites of Spring (Break). In addition to dealing with a disgraced patriarch in hiding on the island after the fallout from society-related scandals, Amy and her friends fall victim to increasingly serious accidents‚Äîwhile Amy gets close to the patriarch who betrayed her. Back on campus for Tap & Gown, Amy readies for graduation between juggling unfulfilled gen-ed credits and helping to select a new tap class, amidst dwindling post-graduation prospects. Troubling phone calls only add to Amy's stress when her prospective tap has gaps in her resume‚Äîand a mysterious past that includes Amy's new boyfriend. Morning Glory Morning Glory is a novelization of the 2010 motion picture Morning Glory, written by Aline Brosh McKenna and starring Harrison Ford, Rachel McAdams and Diane Keaton. Going into the project, Peterfreund wrote, \\"My goal was always to remain as true to the script as possible, and to preserve the content, tone, and intent of the screenwriter.\\" As McKenna had previously adapted Lauren Weisberger's The Devil Wears Prada, Peterfreund \\"tried to think of how she‚Äôd translated the book into her medium, but backwards.\\"  Killer Unicorns Series  Peterfreund has written two full-length novels and three short stories about or dealing with killer unicorns. These are Rampant, Ascendant, Errant in Kiss Me Deadly: 13 Tales of Paranormal Lore, The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn in Zombies vs. Unicorns, and On a Field, Sable in Eternal Spring. Errant, The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn, and On a Field, Sable are all stand-alone stories in the Killer Unicorn universe, while Rampant and Ascendant are meant to be read in that order.\\"Killer Unicorn Series by Diana Peterfreund\\", Official Website of Diana Peterfreund, 2011, accessed May 16, 2012.

Tripp, his wife, and their son were the first to establish residence there, in 1870. In 1895 it was decided that Willow Springs was too common a name, and a new name would be chosen. The name Callao was chosen because of a resemblance to Callao, Peru, suggested by an old grizzled 1890s prospector in the region who was working out of Gold Hill to the north.

Homeless Not Toothless is committed to encouraging the health, care, and support for as many foster children as possible to have their dental needs met through a well-structured community of doctors and dentists. The organization now has hundreds of dental practices, students and labs involved, volunteering their time and effort throughout the greater Los Angeles area and received many of its patients through referrals by the Venice Family Clinic as well as local outreach programs. Now, referrals mostly come from the VA, local shelters and past clients/patients. Since its start, HNT has provided more than $5,000,000 in dental treatment to over 60,000 of its patients. HNT hosted a fundraiser with actress Sharon Stone and writer/producer Antwone Fisher at the Smile for Every Child fundraiser on September 10, 2009. The event was held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Santa Monica. The goal of the fundraiser was to raise five million dollars to build a facility that will treat the homeless and foster children of Los Angeles County. As of October 15, 2009, the building has been fully funded and remodeled, and a remainder of one million dollars needs to be raised to fund completion of the dental clinic. The medical component of the facility has been completed and is open and running. The fundraiser event attracted the support of many celebrities including Sharon Stone, Antwone Fisher, William H. Macy, Larry King, Todd Black and others. The program raised funds for the free El Monte Dental Clinic, which will allow the program's participating dentists to provide free dental care to 28,000 Los Angeles foster children. Donations may be made for the organization and its upcoming clinic on the organization's website http://www.homelessnottoothless.org Dr. Grossman, the CEO and founder since 1992, has received numerous awards for his philanthropy. Stats for 2015: ‚Ä¢ 16,085 children were seen pro-bono; ‚Ä¢ More than 300 procedures were performed for Veterans and the underserved communities; ‚Ä¢ Hundreds of volunteers - many are dental students; ‚Ä¢ The value of donated dental services for 2015 is more than $885,000. ‚Ä¢ Over 60,000 patients were seen as of the endo of 2019 HNT has utilized dental students at UCLA as well as Western University College of Dental Medicine as interns which has given the students the experience of treating patients outside the school environment while eliminating the cost of labor, allowing the overhead to remain under 10% per year. Raising several hundred thousand dollars a year in donations is a constant goal, with the ultimate goal of a $5-Million endowment that will allow the program to live on in perpetuity. Current Board members include Dr. Jay Grossman, Dr. Briar Flicker-Grossman, Sharon Stone, Larry Bernstein, and A Slice of PR. Donors of HNT include Mattel, The Annenberg Foundation, Wells Fargo, The American Legion, California Community Foundation, Charles and Mildred Schnurmacher Foundation, Inc. and The David Geffen Foundation In September 2020, Mayor Garcetti acknowledged HNT for reaching 10,000 days of providing over 60,000 homeless veterans, foster children, women of domestic violence, and the poor over $5-Million in pro-bono dental care.

He was the eldest child (but third-born son) of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and High Duke of Poland in 1173, by his second wife Eudoxia, daughter of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. Life Almost immediately after his birth, Boles≈Çaw was considered the main successor to his father in the Greater Poland inheritance, especially since Mieszko III had become the High Duke and overlord of Poland in 1173 after the death of his brother Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly. In 1177 the authoritarian government of Mieszko III began The Rebellion of The Krak√≥w Nobility and called upon his brother, Casimir II the Just to take the title of High Duke. At the same time was joined to the conspiracy Mieszko III's eldest son Odon (from his first marriage), who resented his father's favoritism for the children born to his second marriage with Eudoxia. The revolt which broke out in Greater Poland between 1177-1179 was a complete surprise to Mieszko III, who was forced to escape from Poland with Boles≈Çaw and his younger brothers Mieszko and W≈Çadys≈Çaw. The deposed High Duke took refuge in Bohemia, Germany and then in the court of his son-in-law Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania. Mieszko III regained the control over Greater Poland in 1181, thanks to the help of Pomeranian troops. One he recovered his domains, Mieszko III didn't divided his domains between his sons (as was expected) and already trying to pull his own political plans who were centered in the recovery of Krak√≥w and with this, the Seniorate Province. In 1186 Leszek, Duke of Masovia died without issue. In his will, he left all the Masovian-Kuyavian principality to his youngest uncle Casimir II the Just. However, Mieszko III could mastered Kuyavia; soon after, he passed his new acquisition to Boles≈Çaw (some historians believed that Boles≈Çaw only obtain Kuyavia in 1194 after the death of Casimir II the Just). Another important year in Boles≈Çaw could be 1191, when his father, using the absence of Casimir II the Just (who was involved in the Kievan Rus' succession disputes) seized and conquer Krak√≥w. Then, for unknown reasons, Mieszko III didn't took personally the government of the capital, but gave them to Boles≈Çaw (although some sources believed that the prince who was appointed Governor of Krak√≥w was Mieszko the Younger). Boles≈Çaw's rule as governor in Krak√≥w wasn't too long, because soon Casimir II the Just could recover his authority over the capital and imprisoned his nephew. However, the victorious Casimir II acted generously and sent the prince with his father. On 5 May 1194 Casimir II the Just died unexpectedly, leaving to minor sons: Leszek and Konrad. Mieszko III saw his brother's death as a new opportunity to regain the supreme power; however, this time the local nobility stood at the side of Casimir II's sons. Mieszko III's Greater Poland and Kuyavian troops and the Lesser Poland's troops (who fight on behalf of Leszek and Konrad), led by the voivode Miko≈Çaj Gryfita, faced in the bloody Battle of Mozgawa (13 September 1195); Boles≈Çaw was among the casualties. Mieszko III, seriously injured, withdraw to Kalisz without waiting for the Silesia troops who came to his aid, led by Mieszko I Tanglefoot and Jaros≈Çaw of Opole. Marriage and issue Around 1187/89, Boles≈Çaw married with Dobroslawa (b. 1162/72 - d. 23 November 1206/after 1230?), a Pomeranian princess.Although sources clearly established Dobroslawa's origin, her exact parentage is disputed among historians. Some sources, e.g. place her as a daughter of Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania by his first wife Walburgis; Herbert Stoyan places her as a daughter of Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania; and finally Michael Shuster calls her a daughter of either Casimir I, Duke of Pomerania- Demmin or Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania. They all certainly had only female offspring, but the exact number remains disputed. Various sources show some of the following three daughters, but no source shows all three of them: #Eudoxia (Audacia) (b. ca. 1190/95 ‚Äì d. 1270), married in 1208 to Henry I, Count of Schwerin. #Wierzchos≈Çawa (b. bef. 1195 ‚Äì d. 2 January/11 September? ca. 1212), a nun in Strzelno. #Daughter (Dobroslawa?) (b. posthumously? bef. 1196 ‚Äì d. aft. 1249/53), married in 1210/15 to Jaczo I, Lord of G√ºtzkow. After his death without male issue, Kuyavia returned to his father Mieszko III, but in 1198 he ceded the Duchy to Casimir II's sons in exchange of his recognition as High Duke.

His progress was witnessed in correspondence with the king and between Ibbi-Sin and the governor of Kazallu (Puzur-Numushda, latterly renamed Puzur-≈†ulgi.) These are literary letters, copied in antiquity as scribal exercises and whose authenticity is unknown. Charged with acquiring grain in Isin and Kazallu, Ishbi-Erra complained that he could not ship the 72,000 GUR he had bought for 20 talents of silver‚Äîapparently an exorbitant price‚Äîand now kept secure in Isin to other conurbations due to the incursions of the Amorites (‚ÄúMartu‚Äù) and requested Ibbi-Sin supply 600 boats to transport it while also requesting governorship of Isin and Nippur.CBS 2272, letter from I≈°bi-erra to Ibbi-Sin. Although Ibbi-Sin baulked at promoting him, Ishbi-Erra apparently succeeded in wrestling control over Isin by Ibbi-Sin‚Äôs 8th year, when he began assigning his own regnal year-names, and thereafter an uneasy chill descended on their relationship. Ibbi-Sin bitterly lambasted Ishbi-Erra as being \\"not of Sumerian seed\\" in his letter to Puzur-≈†ulgi and opined that: ‚ÄúEnlil has stirred up the Amorites out of their land, and they will strike the Elamites and capture Ishbi-Erra.‚Äù Curiously, Puzur-≈†ulgi seems to have originally been one of Ishbi-Erra‚Äôs own messengers and indicated the extent to which loyalties were in flux during the waning years of the regime of the third dynasty of Ur. While there was no outright conflict, Ishbi-Erra continued to extend his influence as Ibbi-Sin‚Äôs steadily declined over the next 12 years or so, until Ur was finally conquered by Kindattu of Elam. Ishbi-Erra went on to win decisive victories against the Amorites in his 8th year and the Elamites in his 16th year. Some years later, Ishbi-Erra ousted the Elamite garrison from Ur, thereby asserting suzerainty over Sumer and Akkad, celebrated in one of his later 27th year-name, although this specific epithet was not used by this dynasty until the reign of Iddin-Dagan.

The former is usually done using high-fiber vegetables and fruits, such as Chinese cabbage, carrot, apple and pineapple, while the latter marinated group is made using a wide variety of vegetables, ranging from mustards and cucumbers to winter melon and radishes. As of now, there are more than 130 kinds of pickles. History Chinese pickles have a long history that dates back to 1100 B.C.E., during the Zhou dynasty. The word ‚Äúpickle‚Äù, ‚Äútsu ('zi' in Pinyin)‚Äù in Chinese, means ‚Äúsalt and incubate‚Äù. The pickled vegetables and fruit we refer to today date in practice back to the sixth century B.C.E. Ancient people pickled mainly to preserve their vegetables and fruit because pickling preserves food far past the natural date of expiration. Foods would often be pickled during the harvest season for consumption during later parts of the year. Flavor Chinese pickles all need to balance the flavors of sweet, sour, pungent, salt, bitter and savory. There are also spicy pickles with floral notes, such as the Szechuan pepper. However, most Chinese pickles still aim for a balance between the tastes of vinegar, salt, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, hot chili, sugar, and the vegetable or fruit itself. Most pickles need to wait for a few months for the vegetables and fruit to ferment. There are also \\"quickles\\"‚Äîa portmanteau of \\"quick\\" and \\"pickles\\"‚Äîthat people can eat them after a few hours or a few days. Cucumber pickles, for example, may be eaten after they have been pickled in a jar for three hours. Consumption Chinese pickle can be eaten directly from the jar as an appetizer, or used as an ingredient for cooking a larger dish. Before the meal, it is served with wine, beer, sodas, or tea to stimulate people's appetite. People eat the small dishes of Chinese pickles and some snacks to drink and chat. Chinese people can also eat pickles as a dish with steamed rice when they do not have many dishes. Chinese pickles are used as ingredients to cook the food as flavor base. Pickling ginger and pickling pepper are most frequently used ingredients to make Sichuan food. It can also help to flavor and enhance the vegetable, meat, poultry, and seafood. For example, Chinese cook duck soup with pickling radish to make the soup more delicious. Fermented Glass Chinese pickle jar commonly used to pickle vegetables Vegetables and plums are salted and allowed to ferment with the help of Lactic acid bacteria. Depending on the desired product, the vegetable may also be fermented with Chinese wine and spices. Some types of these preserved vegetables are produced through being repeatedly dried after the fermentation. *Gongcai () *Meigan cai () *Suan cai () *la baicai () *Tianjin preserved vegetable () *Prunus mume () *Zhacai () *Ya cai () Marinated Vegetables are usually marinated in a soy sauce mixture with sugar, vinegar, salt, and additional spices.

The report, citing limited data in a statistical meta analysis, indicates a potential two-fold increased risk of oesophageal cancer associated with Asian pickled vegetable consumption. Results from the research are described as having \\"high heterogeneity\\" and the study said that further well-designed prospective studies were warranted. However, their results stated \\"The majority of subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant association between consuming pickled vegetables and Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma\\". The 2009 meta-analysis reported heavy infestation of pickled vegetables with fungi. Some common fungi can facilitate the formation of N-nitroso compounds, which are strong oesophageal carcinogens in several animal models. Roussin red methyl ester, a non-alkylating nitroso compound with tumour-promoting effect in vitro, was identified in pickles from Linxian in much higher concentrations than in samples from low-incidence areas. Fumonisin mycotoxins have been shown to cause liver and kidney tumours in rodents. A 2017 study in Chinese Journal of Cancer has linked salted vegetables (common among Chinese cuisine) to a fourfold increase in nasopharynx cancer, where fermentation was a critical step in creating nitrosamines, which some are confirmed carcinogens, as well as activation of Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus by fermentation products.

It is also one of the three magnet high schools in Hanoi, Vietnam, along with Hanoi-Amsterdam High School and Nguyen Hue High School. Established by the French authorities in 1908 as High School of the Protectorate (French: Lyc√©e du Protectorat), Chu Van An is one of the oldest institutions for secondary education in South East Asia. Despite the initial intention to train native civil servants to serve the French colonial establishments, Vietnamese students at B∆∞·ªüi school had many times struggled against colonial doctrine. A lot of B∆∞·ªüi alumni became renowned political leaders and cultural figures in many areas of Vietnamese society such as Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ª´ - the fourth general secretary of Communist Party of Vietnam, Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng - the first prime minister of North Vietnam and united Vietnam, Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥- former vice president and prime minister of South Vietnam, Kaysone Phomvihane- former leader of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, Prince Souphanouvong- the first president of Laos. In 1945, Lyc√©e du Protectorat was renamed to Chu Van An High School.  History  On 12 December 1908, the Governor-General of Indochina Antony Wladislas Klobukowski made the decision to establish Coll√®ge du Protectorat (College of the Protectorate, similar to the secondary school) based on the merger of the Th√¥ng ng√¥n B·ªù s√¥ng school, the Jules Ferry Nam Dinh secondary school and the pedagogy class (Cours normal) on Pottier street. In 1931, the school was upgraded to a lyc√©e (similar to the high school) - Lyc√©e du Protectorat (The school of Protectorate). Since the school was built on the land of Thuy Khu√™ village, K·∫ª B∆∞·ªüi, people often called itB∆∞·ªüi School. By 1943, the school had to move to the Ph√∫c Nh·∫°c monastery in Ninh B√¨nh.In 1945, they returned to H√† N·ªôi. After Japan overthrow France, on 12 June 1945, the northern king's special envoy Phan K·∫ø To·∫°i decided to change the school's name to Chu Van An - named after the most well-respected teacher in Vietnamese history Chu VƒÉn An , and appointed professor Nguy·ªÖn Gia T∆∞·ªùng to the principal position. T∆∞·ªùng was the first Vietnamese principal of the B∆∞·ªüi - Chu VƒÉn An High School. Admission As one of three high schools for gifted students in Hanoi (together with Hanoi - Amsterdam High School and Nguyen Hue Specialized High School), Chu Van An High School is highly selective in its admission process. Every year, the school receives over 3000 applications out of which only 500 to 600 would be admitted. Applicants are required to take an entrance examination conducted by Hanoi Department of Education and Training. This examination usually takes place around mid-June with three subjects - Mathematics, Literature and English, and one additional subject for students who want to be admitted in specialized classes.

It was formed during the privatisation of British Rail and transferred to the private sector in April 1996. Initially operated by Great North Eastern Railway (GNER), it has since been operated by National Express East Coast, East Coast and Virgin Trains East Coast. It has now been taken over by London North Eastern Railway (LNER). History Great North Eastern Railway GNER InterCity 125 at King's Cross station in May 2007 In April 1996, Sea Containers, operating under the GNER brand, commenced a seven-year contract to operate the franchise. In March 2000, the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) shortlisted Sea Containers and Virgin Rail Group to bid for the next franchise.Six Companies Shortlisted for First Franchise Replacement Round Shadow Strategic Rail Authority 14 March 2000 The franchise was to be for 20 years and included proposals for new trains and replacements of sections of track. In January 2002, the SRA scrapped the refranchising process and awarded a two-year extension to Sea Containers until April 2005.GNER Franchise Extended to 2005 Sea Containers 16 January 2002 In October 2004, the SRA issued an Invitation to Tender for the next franchise to the four shortlisted bidders, Danish State Railways/English Welsh & Scottish, FirstGroup, GNER and Virgin Rail Group. In March 2005, the franchise was awarded to GNER for seven years, with a three-year extension based on targets being met, starting on 1 May 2005. GNER committed to pay a ¬£1.3 billion premium to the Department for Transport (DfT) over ten years. However, due to the financial problems caused by it having overbid as well as financial difficulties encountered by the parent company, in December 2006 the government announced it was stripping the franchise from Sea Containers and would put it up for re-tender, with GNER running the franchise on fixed fee management contract in the interim. National Express East Coast In February 2007, the DfT announced Arriva, FirstGroup, National Express and Virgin Rail Group had been shortlisted to lodge bids for the franchise. In April 2007, it was announced that GNER had a 10% stake in the Virgin Rail Group bid. In August 2007 the franchise was awarded to National Express,National Express awarded contract for growth on InterCity East Coast Department for Transport 14 August 2007 and GNER's services transferred to National Express East Coast (NXEC) on 9 December 2007. By 2009, NXEC was under increasing financial pressure due to rising fuel prices and the economic downturn. Instead of projected increases in revenue from the franchise, in the first half of 2009 NXEC ticket sales income decreased by 1%. In April 2009, National Express confirmed that it was still pursuing talks with the government over possible financial assistance with the franchise, either through a reduction in the premium due, or other assistance. In July 2009, National Express announced it planned to default on the franchise, having failed to renegotiate the contractual terms of operation, and would not provide any further funding. This meant NXEC would run out of cash by the end of 2009. As a result, the DfT announced it would re- nationalise the franchise. East Coast Main Line Company East Coast InterCity 225 at Edinburgh Waverley station in June 2014 The franchise was re- nationalised on 14 November 2009 with Directly Operated Railways' subsidiary East Coast taking over, with the intention being that operations would return to a private franchisee by December 2013.National Express East Coast franchise Department for Transport 1 July 2009 In March 2013, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that this would be put back to February 2015.Railway plan puts new focus on passengers Secretary of State for Transport 26 March 2013 Virgin Trains East Coast An InterCity 125 seen at Leeds station, operated by Virgin Trains East Coast. In January 2014, FirstGroup, Keolis/Eurostar International Limited (EIL) and Stagecoach/Virgin were announced as the shortlisted bidders for the new franchise. In November 2014, the franchise was awarded to Stagecoach/Virgin, who trading as Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) commenced operating the franchise on 1 March 2015.More seats, more services and new trains for East Coast passengers Department for Transport 27 November 2014 In November 2017 Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling announced the early termination of the East Coast franchise in 2020, three years ahead of schedule, following losses on the route by the operator. Virgin Trains East Coast had been due to pay more than ¬£2 billion in franchise premiums to the government over the last four years of its contract. Secretary Grayling claimed the losses were due to VTEC simply overestimating future growth in passenger revenue in its bid calculations, meaning franchise payments due to the government exceeded the profits being returned by running the services, while others believe the delays in state owned Network Rail delivering expected infrastructure upgrades meant the company could not operate the increased number of services needed to generate this increased revenue.

Kahn's playing career extended for 17 seasons (1936‚Äì42 and 1944‚Äì53), all in minor league baseball. He initially signed with his hometown St. Louis Cardinals, and spent his career in a number of Major League farm systems. Although he batted .304 in 1,507 minor league games, he never rose higher than the top level of the minors.Baseball Reference (minors) During the course of his lengthy playing career, Kahn toiled for three seasons under executive Branch Rickey, inventor of the farm system, and Kahn came to be known as a fierce critic of Rickey and the system he created. \\"He knocked down everyone's salaries, and he put the difference between what they got, and what they should have got, in his own pocket,\\" Kahn once said. \\"I was just a number to Branch Rickey.

It was written by Peter Lerangis and was released by Scholastic on February 2, 2010. The 39 Clues series is intended for children aged 8‚Äì12, and takes the form of a multimedia adventure story spanning 10 books. The stories focus on a brother and sister, Amy and Dan Cahill, and their efforts to piece together clues left by the matriarch of the family, Grace Cahill, upon her death.Scholastic Media Joins Post Cereals for The 39 Clues \\"Race to Win\\" Sweepstakes The Viper's Nest follows immediately on from the events of the preceding book: In Too Deep. The events are described, below, using in-universe tone. Shocked by the death of Irina Spasky, Dan and Amy venture into danger once again. For the first, they begin to question how much they trust their au pair, Nellie. Later in the book, she regains their trust.

The two kids are shaken by what had happened, not believing that Irina was on their side, after attempting to kill them earlier in the series. They realize that Isabel has reported them to the police, and they make a quick getaway using Irina‚Äôs boat. Dan finds a notebook in Irina‚Äôs bag and in it they find the phrase : \\"I'm with you and you're with me and so we are all together\\".

They escape with the help of Professor Bardsley, a Cahill that is uninvolved with the Hunt, together with the vial of green liquid that they thought was their first clue in The Maze of Bones, by flying Grace Cahill's old plane, The Flying Lemur. During the ride, Dan and Amy accidentally break the vial, spilling some of the contents onto Dan's arm. It is revealed to be a Lucian poison.

This community theater produces a full year-round season of Broadway and off-Broadway revivals, professional productions of works by Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe, a program devoted to children's theater, and special events throughout the year. Many do not know that it was not always a castle. , To the summer residents of the 1940s and 1950s who vacationed on Budd Lake, it was a Jewish Community Center, and then in the early 70s, a fraternal hall for the local Knights of Columbus.  The Founding of Pax Amicus  But Pax Amicus Theatre actually began seven years earlier. In 1970 Stan Barber and Bob Findlay (both are still residents of Mt. Olive), tenured teachers at West Morris Regional High School in Chester, left their jobs to found PAX AMICUS, a community art center which they originally housed in a historic, (built in the 1850s) former Presbyterian church in Flanders, which they purchased with personal loans and mortgages. Within a year of remodeling and rebuilding, assisted by teens, their parents and many good Samaritans, they were up and running, opening its doors with a musical tribute to Jacques Brel, the French and Belgian troubadour who set the tone for the musical and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s. By 1977, Pax Amicus, by then a successful community theatre, made the decision to purchase the Knights of Columbus Hall and convert it into a castle as a home for its growing theatre for children productions. Stan Barber, Pax's co-founder and director, with the herculean labor of friends and colleagues: Paul Berry (of Mt. Olive), George Stults (of Washington Township), Rusty Cook (of Basking Ridge), Tim O'Brien (of Chester) and John Hammel (of Morristown), conceived and rebuilt the dilapidated, aging building into one of Mt. Olive's most vibrant and visible landmarks. The re-construction took less than two years, and for their efforts Pax Amicus Castle was named Outstanding Building of the Year - FIRST PLACE by the National Remodelers Association. The guests of honor at its ribbon cutting ceremony, which also included a production of A Man for All Seasons, included Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch of the West, of the MGM film classic of The Wizard of Oz, and an up-and-coming unknown young actor named Kevin Bacon. For 6 years, both theatres - the Church Theatre in Flanders and the new Castle Theatre - functioned full time, but in 1983, it was decided to move all productions to the Castle, and the old Church was sold to a private family. Sadly, in 2011, a fire destroyed the top half of the old Presbyterian Church (gratefully, no one was hurt) and its future will depend on its present owners. Pax Amicus is a not-for-profit foundation, is not corporate-supported or government granted and survives solely on ticket sales, private donations, and the loyalty and enjoyment of its theatre goers. Pax Amicus is not funded by, nor does it endorse or support, any religious, political, fraternal or social organization or point of view. Some might find it difficult at first to pronounce (it is most commonly pronounced pox a'-mi-cus) but for most, it is a gentle visit to a small, but inviting wonderland - a magical place - whose very name means \\"Peace Friend.\\" It is based on the proposition that the arts can be a valuable bridge, a vehicle for friendship, community, and peace.  The Building of the Castle  The actual structure of what would become Pax Amicus Castle Theatre originated as a simple cinder-block box building constructed in the late 1940s as a synagogue that stood on the shore of scenic Budd Lake in northwest Morris County, NJ's largest natural spring-fed lake. The Jewish community sold the building to the local chapter of the Knights of Columbus in 1970 who used it primarily as a fraternal hall. Pax Amicus, with its home theatre in a former country Presbyterian church in nearby Flanders, purchased the building late in 1977 to serve primarily as a home for its extremely popular Theatre for Children. What was to be a simple plywood 'castle' facade turned into an act of passionate design and building. Stan Barber, drawing on his knowledge of and fascination with medieval and Renaissance periods, found the perfect prototype in a 15th century French chateau. Armed with drawings by local artist, Mahlon Jacobsen of Chester and architectural plans by Jacques Duvoisin, Paul Berry, then age 25 and George Stults, almost 30, with help from Rusty Cook, John Hammel, Tim O'Brien, Ron Barber and a few others, re-structured the cinder-block box into what now stands as Pax Amicus Castle Theatre. The National Remodelers Association named Pax Amicus Castle Theatre: The Outstanding Building of the Year of 1979 - 1st Place Award, citing the designer and builder's unique use of an existing building, sensitivity to the environment (not one tree was disturbed) its structural soundness, and its form-function marriage: a Castle as a Theatre for Children. Paul, at the time a high school graduate, then went on to study at Pratt and become a designer working for a major NJ architectural firm. George has turned the apartment complex he manages into an award winning gem. Because of the Castle's uniqueness, visibility and highway accessibility, major productions were also being presented there. For 5 years, both locations were used. It was decided to move all operations over to the Castle and put the Church Theatre up for sale. In 1983, The former Presbyterian Church of Flanders became the former Pax Amicus Church Theatre, and is now a private home. In 1990, Pax Amicus acquired the beach property directly across the Castle, merged adjacent properties to guarantee that the Castle and its surrounding land would remain accessible to the general public.

Founded in 1978, it is the winner of the 1999 Regional Theatre Tony Award. History Crossroads Theatre Company is an African-American theater. In 1978, a group of African- American actors and leaders met with the Regional Director of the Comprehensive Employment & Training Administration, Ed Hardy, and Director of Management Development & Training, Susan Morris, to request funds for the establishment of a Black theater in New Brunswick, New Jersey. A grant was awarded to them under the CETA program, which enabled the artists to start up the theater in the old King Block building in the heart of New Brunswick, where it became an integral part of the Rutgers University-New Brunswick Tomorrow redevelopment and premier theater experience. By 1985, it was thriving and had 1,300 subscribers. Crossroads was so successful that it moved to a new building where it is located today, enduring for 35 years from its modest beginnings based on the foresight and vision of a small group of individuals. Crossroads' primary effort has been its four-play main stage season, where the many timbres of the African-American experience have been given voice in full productions. Since its founding, Crossroads has produced over 100 works, many of which were premiere productions by African and African-American artists. Crossroads' world premieres include The Colored Museum, which originated at Crossroads in 1986 and was then seen by millions on national public television when it was produced for WNETs \\"Great Performances,\\" and Spunk, both by Tony Award winner George C.

Information Sarah Lee was born on 10 September 1791, the only daughter of John Eglinton Wallis of Colchester. In 1813, she married the naturalist Thomas Edward Bowdich, whose interests in nature, travel, and adventure she shared. In 1819, they went to Paris to visit Baron Cuvier; Thomas had previously visited him in 1818 with a letter of introduction obtained from Dr. William Elford Leach of the British Museum. They spent most of the next four years in Paris studying his collections. In 1823, on their final trip to Africa, they visited Madeira on their way, but her husband died on the Gambia River on 10 January 1824. Left with three children, she struggled to support her family as an author. Early in her widowhood, Mrs Bowdich often visited Baron Cuvier in Paris, where he treated her almost like a daughter; upon his death in 1832, she wrote a memoir of his life. In 1826, she married Robert Lee and in subsequent years published under the name Mrs. Robert Lee. In 1854, she was granted a civil list pension of ¬£50 per year. In 1856, she died at Erith while visiting her daughter Eugenia.

He won medals in the team dressage events in the 1952, 1956, 1964, and 1968 games; there was no team dressage event held in 1960, but he won an individual dressage medal in that year. In 1968, he and fellow equestrian Henri Chammartin jointly became the second Swiss sportspersons to compete at five Olympic Games. (The first was middle-distance runner Paul Martin.) Early life Fischer was born on 8 November 1915 in Meisterschwanden, Switzerland. Olympic career Fischer first competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland at the age of 36, in both the individual and team dressage events. He came in a disappointing 8th place in the individual event, behind both of his Swiss teammates; Gottfried Trachsel, who finished 4th, and Henri Chammartin, who finished 6th. However, he earned the first of five Olympic medals, a silver, in the team event with Trachsel and Chammartin. Four years later, at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, Fischer again medaled in the team event, and again fell short in the individual. This time, Trachsel, Chammartin, and Fischer took bronze, and finished 6th, 8th, and 10th respectively in the individual event. Of the three athletes, only Fischer and Chammartin would compete in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, although in any case no team dressage event was held that year. However, Fischer found new success, winning second place and a silver medal in the individual dressage competition, the only individual medal of his career. The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, saw Fischer as the oldest member of the Swiss team, at 48 years of age. That year, he just missed winning a second individual medal in dressage, taking fourth place while his teammate Henri Chammartin took gold. However, with Chammartin and 21-year-old Marianne Gossweiler, the youngest Swiss equestrian athlete at the games, Fischer earned yet another silver medal in team dressage. He won his final Olympic medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico at the age of 52, a bronze in team dressage, again with Chammartin and Gossweiler.

The paradox was to figure out how dolphins can obtain such high speeds and accelerations with what appears to be a small muscle mass. Gray made an estimate of the power a dolphin could exert based on its physiology, and concluded the power was insufficient to overcome the drag forces in water. He hypothesized that Dolphin's skin must have special anti-drag properties.Gray, J (1936) Studies in animal locomotion VI. The propulsive powers of the dolphin\\" J. Exp. Biol. 13: 192‚Äì199. In 2008, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, West Chester University and the University of California, Santa Cruz used digital particle image velocimetry to prove Gray wrong. Timothy Wei, professor and acting dean of Rensselaer‚Äôs School of Engineering, videotaped two bottlenose dolphins, Primo and Puka, as they swam through a section of water populated with hundreds of thousands of tiny air bubbles. Computer software and force measurement tools developed for aerospace were then used to study the particle-image velocimetry which was captured at 1,000 frames per second (fps). This allowed the team to measure the force exerted by a dolphin. Results showed the dolphin to exert approximately 200 lb of force every time it thrust its tail ‚Äì 10 times more than Gray hypothesized ‚Äì and at peak force can exert between 300 and 400 lb. Wei also used this technique to film dolphins as they were doing tail-stands, a trick where the dolphins ‚Äúwalk‚Äù on water by holding most of their bodies vertical above the water while supporting themselves with short, powerful thrusts of their tails. In 2009, researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan introduced new concepts of ‚Äúkidnapped airfoils‚Äù and ‚Äúcirculating horsepower‚Äù to explain the swimming capabilities of the swordfish. Swordfish swim at even higher speeds and accelerations than dolphins. The researchers claim their analysis also \\"solves the perplexity of dolphin‚Äôs Gray paradox\\".Lee, Hsing-Juin; Jong, Yow-Jeng; Change, Li-Min; and Wu, Wen-Lin (2009) \\"Propulsion Strategy Analysis of High-Speed Swordfish\\" Transactions of the Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences, 52 (175): 11. Gray's flawed assumption The prior research efforts to refute Gray's paradox only looked at the drag reducing aspect of dolphin's skin, but never questioned the basic assumption of Gray \\"that drag cannot be greater than muscle work\\" which led to paradox in the first place. In 2014, a team of theoretical mechanical engineers from Northwestern University proved the underlying hypothesis of Gray's paradox wrong.Bale et al. (2014) Gray's paradox: A fluid mechanical perspective\\" Nature: Scientific Reports 4: Article number: 5904. They showed mathematically that drag on undulatory swimmers (such as dolphins) can indeed be greater than the muscle power it generates to propel itself forward, without being paradoxical. They introduced the concept of \\"energy cascade\\" to show that during steady swimming all of the generated muscle power is dissipated in the wake of the swimmer (through viscous dissipation). A swimmer uses muscle power to undulate its body, which causes it to experience both drag and thrust simultaneously. Muscle power generated should be equated to power needed to deform the body, rather than equating it to the drag power. On the contrary drag power should be equated to thrust power. This is because during steady swimming, drag and thrust are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Their findings can be summarized in a simple power balance equation: : \\\\mathbf{P}_{muscle} + \\\\mathbf{P}_{thrust} = \\\\mathbf{P}_{drag} + \\\\mathbf{P}_{deformation} in which, : \\\\mathbf{P}_{muscle} = \\\\mathbf{P}_{deformation} \\\\text { and } \\\\mathbf{P}_{thrust} = \\\\mathbf{P}_{drag} . It is important to acknowledge the fact that a swimmer does not have to spend energy to overcome drag all through its muscle work; it is also assisted by the thrust force in this task. Their research also shows that defining drag on the body is definitional and many definitions of drag on the swimming body are prevalent in literature. Some of these definitions can give higher value than the muscle power. However, this doesn't lead to any paradox because higher drag also means higher thrust in the power balance equation, and this does not violate any energy balance principles.

Her career spanned six decades and produced more than 1,000 works of art in oil, watercolor, pen and ink and other media in styles that included impressionism, social realism and abstraction.  Early life and education  Eve Drewelowe was born in New Hampton, Iowa on April 15, 1899 to George Drewelow and Mary Marguerita Martin. The eighth child of twelve, she grew up on a farm with a tomboyish spirit. Her father died when Eve was just 11 years old. She did not take art classes in her youth due to her farm duties, but she later came to appreciate this. She believed a formal artistic education would have hindered her development of a unique artistic style.Carnes, Jan. Biographical Diary. N.d. MS 4, Eve Drewelowe. Iowa Women's Archives, n.p. She graduated from New Hampton High School in 1919. She attended the University of Iowa School of Art and Art History, receiving a bachelor's degree in graphic and plastic arts in 1923. Working closely with her father figure and mentor Carl Seashore, she encouraged the university to establish a graduate program in the arts. In 1924 she became the first student to earn a master's degree in studio arts from the university, and one of the first in the nation. Throughout her undergraduate and graduate school educations, Drewelowe experimented with impressionism. Art professor Charles A. Cumming discouraged any influences on her work outside of classwork. She was educated with little emphasis on contemporary art. Regardless, she showed interest in Cubism and other forms of abstract art.Shannon, Lindsay E. \\"Drewelowe: Feminist Identity in American Art.\\" Women's History Review 22.2 (2013): 295-309. Taylor and Francis Group. Atypon Literatum, 21 Jan. 2013. Web. 16 Oct. 2015.  Career  Despite warnings from Cumming that marriage could be fatal to her career, Eve married a fellow University of Iowa graduate and political scientist Jacob Van Ek in 1923. Shortly after, the couple moved to Boulder, Colorado where he taught and became dean at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Drewelowe became a founding member and president of the Boulder Arts Guild in the city. She taught part-time at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1927-1928 and in the Department of Fine Arts in 1936-1937 for two summer sessions.  Early landscape work  Drewelowe's father George Drewelow, a farmer and environmentalist, was a large influence on her work. This and her love of Western landscapes had a strong impact on the subject matter of work. In the early years of her artistic career, Eve painted landscapes almost exclusively. She especially favored the views in Colorado, featured in works such as Pine and Peak, Aspen, Colorado.\\"Artist Biography for Eve Drewelowe.\\" AskART. AskART, n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2015. Although some paintings feature figures and most others simply a landscape, all of the paintings from this period in her life are painted within the spectrum of social realism.Benetti, Melvyn. \\"Eve Drewelowe: The Transition of a Social Realist to an Abstract Painter.\\" Thesis. Iowa Women's Archives, 1989. Print. Eve traveled with her husband Jacob to 23 countries in a span of 13 months. She filled seven sketchbooks with the inspirational sights she encountered. She produced many vivid landscape paintings based on her travels.Taylor, Carol. \\"Boulder History: Eve Drewelowe, Modernist and Feminist.\\" Boulder Daily Camera. Digital First Media, 30 June 2012. Web. 16 Oct. 2015.\\"Eve Van Ek Drewelowe.\\" David Cook Galleries. David Cook Galleries, n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2015. She produced Telling Trails, a series of ink drawings documenting her trip. This is the first documented incidence of what would become characteristic for Eve in this time‚Äî‚Äúflowing, undulating lines and unusual perspectives.‚Äù266x266px George Drewelow contributed not only to Eve's artistic style but also to her personal ideals. She often voiced her concerns about increasing human interloping in the natural world as more and more land is converted to developments for the use of humans. She believed in conservation of food, water, resources, and other materials. She felt that humans polluted the allure of the earth, both literally and figuratively by dulling its vivid beauty. Her paintings depict colorful and fantastic landscapes, as if she is imagining how the world would look untouched by humans. However, she stayed well within the realm of realism at this point in her life.  Move to abstraction  In 1940, Drewelowe became gravely ill. She underwent surgery at Mayo Clinic in New York for the removal of a gastric polyp. This procedure was very dangerous at the time. She depicted her painful hospital stays in Self-Portrait (Reincarnation) (1939). In this painting, her body is twisted and clearly in pain, but the colors used are reassuring. The surgery was successful, and this near-death experience gave Drewelowe's artwork a new direction. She began to integrate abstract elements into her paintings and transition her works more into abstraction. Her first entirely abstract painting was Crescendo in 1949. By 1959 her paintings became unrecognizable as landscapes. During her period of ‚Äúreincarnation,‚Äù the colors she used in her painting became bright and vivid. She especially enjoyed working with circles, a theme that appeared often in this period of her art. She began to integrate new materials into her art, such as wood splinters or metal. The canvases she used also grew larger. Everything about her art became more assertive and bold.Maverick (1984) uses a blend of realism and abstraction.  Return to landscape  Despite dabbling with other artistic styles, Drewelowe always showed an inclination toward landscapes. She returned to painting landscapes in the 1980s as she did in the 1920s-30s. In these landscapes from the 1980s she depicted more of a human presence on the land. She was becoming elderly but always wanted to keep painting.\\"Boulder Artist, 87, Focuses on Present.\\" Rocky Mountain News [Denver, CO] Mar. 1987, Entertainment sec.: n. pag. Print. She once said, ‚Äúmy waking thought from an embryo on was my need to be an artist.‚Äù Maverick (1984) is thought to be one of Drewelowe's last paintings. It is a self-portrait utilizing a blend of realism and abstraction. It is as though Drewelowe is culminating her artistic life with a reflection of all of the stages of her life.  Feminism  Though never known to have used the word to describe herself, Eve Drewelowe is often considered a feminist artist. Her personal life exhibited feminist themes: the artist retained her maiden name and publicly stated a disinterest in housework and parenting. Drewelowe chose not to take her husband's last name because in her opinion it should not matter to others whether she is married or not. When Drewelowe and Van Ek returned from their travels and started building a house together, Eve herself constructed much of the furniture and sewed decorations for the home. She did not want to be involved in the pleasantries of being the dean's wife, especially hosting dinner parties, so she specified to have the house built lacking a dining room. She always maintained that she did not want to have children of her own, much to her mother's dismay.Drewelowe, Eve. Autobiographical Draft. N.d. MS 1, Eve Drewelowe. Iowa Women's Archives, n.p. Drewelowe struggled with which surname to use for herself. She exhibited under the name Eve Drewelowe Van Ek until the early 1950s, when she resumed using her maiden name. Even after this point, it can be seen on some of her paintings that she painted Van Ek and then rubbed it out. However, she never wanted to be called Mrs. Van Ek or even Mrs. Drewelowe. In fact, her Daily Camera file in Boulder, Colorado contains a note from Drewelowe stating that ‚Äúshe intends to come back and haunt anyone who refers to her as Mrs. Van Ek in her obituary.‚Äù  Legacy  Although Drewelowe is mainly renowned in Colorado and Iowa, she had solo exhibitions all over the country. Her work was shown at National Association of Women Artists exhibitions, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Denver Art Museum, the National Museum of Women in the Arts and numerous other esteemed institutions. Although women had been in the profession of art for 20‚Äì30 years at the beginning of Drewelowe's career, she still faced opposition and sexism. Critics believe that she could have been much more acclaimed had she not been a woman and had she not fallen ill at the peak of her career. Others believe that her ‚Äúreincarnation‚Äù and transition to abstract paintings increased Drewelowe's popularity as an artist by keeping her relevant in an evolving artistic world. Eve Drewelowe died in Boulder, Colorado, on October 22, 1988. She opted to donate her collection of personal papers and artworks to the University of Iowa School of Art and Art History. She made it known that she donated her body to aid scientific research. Undergraduate scholarships in art are named in her honor at both the University of Colorado and the University of Iowa. In 1979 she was named as a University of Iowa Distinguished Alumni. The Eve Drewelowe Gallery in the University of Iowa's Studio Arts Building is named for her. Her Daily Camera file can be found in the Carnegie Branch library of Boulder, Colorado.

It is essentially a dry spell or drought, though it is often misused to define a player's decline that is natural during their career. There are various theories behind the cause of a slump. Some attribute it simply to the reasons behind a gambler's bad luck. While a player's or team's average collective statistics over a career or season may be quite respectable, there may be peak times when performance is really spectacular, while there are also expected low points with an inevitable drought. Others believe there are psychological issues behind a slump. At times, a player, or all the key players on a team, may feel less motivated or may not be adept to handling clutch situations. Baseball In baseball, a batter can be defined as \\"slumping\\" when he has gotten few or no hits over a period, and his batting average during that time is far below that of his expectations.

It was founded in August 1983 by Richard Nixon, 37th President of the United States, and served as the governing body of the Nixon Library for nearly twenty years. Today it operates the Nixon Library in conjunction with the National Archives and Records Administration,Richard Nixon library offers candid new take on Watergate, Syracuse.com, Associated Press, 31 March 2011, accessed November 2011 which is an entity of the federal government of the United States, in addition to undertaking charitable and education-based activities. The Nixon Foundation founded, controlled and operated the Nixon Library from the library's dedication on July 19, 1990 until July 11, 2007, at which the Foundation invited the National Archives to take control. The two entities signed a joint operating agreement which allowed the library to become officially known as the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, welcoming it into the national system of presidential libraries. This move allowed President Nixon's White House documents to be moved to his library in Yorba Linda. The Nixon Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, led by former Nixon White House domestic adviser James H. Cavanaugh. The board includes President Nixon's daughters Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, his brother Edward Nixon, former Ambassador George ArgyrosArgyros, Forbes.com, accessed November 2011 former California Governor Pete Wilson, and longest- serving Vietnam War POW Everett Alvarez, Jr. The Foundation's President and CEO is nationally-known radio host Hugh Hewitt, who splits his time between Orange County and Washington, D.C. and plans to open a Nixon Foundation office in Washington. Nixon Library and Gardens The Foundation has hosted United States presidents, first ladies and several vice presidents. Also hosted have been public affairs commentators such as Bill O'Reilly, academics such as Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The library includes \\"Meet the Presidents,\\" in which presidential impersonators speak to several hundred school-aged children. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Nixon Foundation brought 16 tons of warped steel from the World Trade Center and a damaged, first-responder FDNY firetruck to the Nixon Library for viewing. Before the National Archives took over its management, the Nixon Library had been accused by several media outlets of glossing over Nixon's 1974 resignation with \\"whitewashed\\" exhibits. In 2007, the National Archives removed the 17 year old Watergate exhibit and, after three years, the new exhibit was scheduled to open in July 2010. The Nixon Foundation objected to the proposed exhibit, because the Nixon Foundation was not consulted in the way that other presidential foundations had been consulted with similar situations. The Foundation filed a 158-page memorandum to the Assistant Archivist for Presidential Libraries expressing their dissatisfaction\\"Watergate Becomes Sore Point at Nixon Library\\", by Adam Nagourney, The New York Times, August 6, 2010 (August 7, 2010 p.

Hunter was re-released in 2018.James Byron Huggins and HUNTER are Back!  Plot  Nathaniel Hunter, the world's expert tracker, is called forward, along with his wolf companion Ghost, to find a child lost in a snow storm. Hunter manages to find the child, despite the kid's random wandering. Deep in the Arctic Circle, a facility is attacked by a hulking creature. Colonel Maddox, Major Westcott, and the mysterious Dixon, consult with Dr. Tipler to identify the footprints and carnage left behind by the beast. Dr. Tipler deduces the creature kills similar to a grizzly but the footprints do not match that of a bear and recommends seeking the help of Hunter. The trio seek Hunter's help and he too is unable to identify the species. Colonel Maddox asks Hunter to lead a kill team to track and kill the beast. Hunter is initially hesitant but accepts the job. Hunter meets the kill team led by Commander Takakura. Against Hunter's wishes, Dr. Tipler also joins the team as an observer. Bobbi Jo, the team's sniper, is assigned to lead the hunt alongside Hunter, whom which she bonds with over the course of the journey. In Washington, the United States Marshals Service assigns Chaney the task to investigate the ravaged facilities in the Arctic Circle. Chaney consults with his former mentor Brick about the assignment, both feeling uneasy how things don't add up. Back at Dr. Tipler's institute, his assistants Gina and Rebecca examine a cast made from the creature's footprints. They recover a tendril from the plaster and Rebecca attempts to have the CIA's physicist Dr. Hamilton examine it. Rebecca stresses that whatever the animal is, it is immune to disease but Dr. Hamilton shrugs off her theories and after she leaves, orders a hit on her. Rebecca is then killed in a car accident. Hunter and the team find the creature but the mission backfires when the beast begins hunting them and kills several soldiers. Dr. Tipler becomes sick, and the team is unable to radio for an extraction due to sabotage. Hunter decides to lead the creature away from the team so they can escape, and manages to hurt the beast with his Bowie knife. He eventually regroups with the team and leads them into a mine to take shelter. The creature reaches the mine and Hunter hurts it once more with the Bowie knife. Chaney interviews both Dr. Hamilton and Dixon about the ravaged facilities, but is only given vague answers. He eventually talks to Gina, who strongly believes Rebecca was murdered. Chaney breaks into Dr. Hamilton's house to find clues and finds an article about a strange hulking creature retrieved from ice during the 1970s. Chaney is then attacked by a hit squad but manages to neutralize them and heads to Brick's bar for help. They later go to the Tipler Institute to save Gina from another hit squad. Afterwards, they head to the last facility in the Arctic where Dr. Hamilton left to. Hunter and the team reach a cavern where they know the creature is waiting for them. The beast speaks to Hunter, who reveals its name to be ‚ÄúLuther‚Äù. After shaking off the beast, Hunter and the team manage to escape and reach the last facility, where Colonel Maddox waits for them. Dr. Hamilton and his team have another creature, long dead, stored deep within the facility. They manage to synthesize a serum that maintains the creature's longevity without turning one into a beast themselves, similar to what happened to Luther. Dr. Hamilton attempts to test this on Dr. Tipler but is stopped by Ghost. Hunter keeps the serum, knowing that it's something Dr. Hamilton doesn't want anyone to know about. Chaney and Brick arrive at the base and interviews Hunter and the team about their encounter with the creature. Dr. Tipler theorizes that the creature is an ancient smilodon. Dr. Hamilton gives Chaney a tour of the facility, while Hunter sneaks into the deep part of the base storing the other creature. Hunter finds a video of Luther injecting himself with a serum and turning into the smilodon-like creature that he and the team encountered. Dr. Hamilton and his security team catch Hunter, and reveals that the operation is an attempt to make certain members of society immortal in order to control and shape the world from the shadows. Brick arrives and opens fire on the security team. Hunter knocks out Dr. Hamilton and destroys the dead creature. Up above, the Luther-creature arrives and attacks the facility. Dr. Tipler dies from a heart attack and Ghost dies battling the creature. Bobbi Jo manages to wound the beast with her Beretta Sniper enough for it to retreat. Dixon arrives with a kill team of his own, planning to tie loose ends by bombing the area, along with Hunter and the survivors. Hunter threatens to destroy the synthesized serum if Dixon doesn't pull out his kill team. Dixon reluctantly complies but upon learning of Dr. Tipler's death, Hunter slashes the serum and forces Dixon into a helicopter, leaving Dr. Hamilton behind to be killed in the bombing. Hunter and the survivors intend on following the creature and kill it once and for all. They follow the creature to a cave and discover that it is the grave site of the species, who murdered each other in blind, cannibalistic rage. Brick, Takakura, and Dixon die in the final battle with the creature. Hunter sets the beast on fire and decapitates him with his Bowie knife. Hunter, Chaney, and Bobbi Jo leave the cave and are evacuated by the US Marshals, who arrest Dr. Hamilton who survived the aerial bombing.  Film adaptation  In 2009, Sylvester Stallone acquired the film rights to Hunter to use as the basis for Rambo: Last Blood, at the time titled Rambo V: The Savage Hunt. Nu Image/Millennium Films released a poster and synopsis for Rambo V: The Savage Hunt. In November 2009, it was reported that the plot had reverted to Rambo crossing the Mexican border to rescue a girl who had been kidnapped. In October 2018, Stallone revealed plans to adapt Hunter into its own feature film with Balboa Productions producing.

The property operated until January 11, 2009 as Silver Club. The property reopened as Bourbon Square on August 1, 2013 and operated until February 5, 2015. It was demolished in 2018. History As of 1961, the property operated as Danny & Don's Bar. In 1964, it was renamed as Sparks Silver Club. As of 1965, the casino was operated by Phair Corporation, and was owned by Ben H. Coleman and Arthur Oetjen with 30 percent ownership each, and Lyndon E. Short with 40 percent. That year, a man filed a complaint against Sparks Silver Club, alleging the casino denied paying him $10,000 after he won a keno game the previous October. The casino believed that cheating was involved in the man's win. The Nevada Gaming Control Board requested the Nevada Gaming Commission to suspend or revoke the casino's gaming license over its refusal to pay the $10,000. In June 1965, the gaming commission voted 4-1 to deny the request, allowing the casino to continue operations. Karl Berge, who would become the paternal grandfather of future actress Jena Malone, purchased the casino in 1967. In January 1980, Berge had tentative plans for a five-story, 200-room hotel to be built on a 0.89-acre site behind the casino, known then as Karl's Silver Club. Sparks city planners as well as some nearby residents were concerned about parking and traffic in the area following the opening of the hotel, so the project was redesigned to include nearly twice as many parking spaces. The Sparks City Council approved plans for an eight-floor, 209-room hotel in May 1980, with construction expected to begin two months later. The hotel would cost between $3.8 million and $4.8 million. The hotel was to be built in a terraced stair-step shape rising away from residential houses to avoid casting shadows on them. In September 1980, the city approved redesigned plans to build the hotel in a vertical and conventional shape, allowing for lower construction costs. The redesigned hotel would include 235 rooms. It was designed by Fred Dolven, who said the original design would have caused the project to run 40 percent over initial estimates. Silver Club logo Groundbreaking for the hotel took place on July 1, 1981, with completion expected by March 1982. Walker Boudwin Construction Co. was the general contractor for the $3.5 million, contemporary style hotel, which would be four stories tall and include 130 rooms. It was designed with the potential to add two additional floors in the future. The hotel would allow Karl's Silver Club to expand its clientele, which primarily consisted of tour bus customers. In August 1981, the city council unanimously approved Berge's request to increase the hotel to six stories and 206 rooms. The $5.2 million hotel opened in March 1982. The hotel, named Karl's Hotel, held an grand opening ceremony on April 16, 1982. In May 1983, construction began on an $8 million renovation of the casino that would include convention space and new restaurants. The expanded casino project ultimately cost $14 million, and was opened in September 1984, with the property now known as Karl's Hotel and Casino. Silver Club in December 2009 The property would later be known as Silver Club. It closed on January 11, 2009. In August 2009, Max Baer Jr., who played Jethro Bodine in The Beverly Hillbillies, began looking into purchasing the property and turning it into Jethro's Beverly Hillbillies Hotel & Casino. Baer has tried to develop a Northern Nevada casino in at least 4 other locations. However, the plan, like his others, never came into fruition. It reopened as Bourbon Square Casino on August 1, 2013, and continued operating until February 5, 2015. Demolition of Bourbon Square began in November 2018. On May 15, 2019, the Nugget Event Center, an 8,000-seat amphitheater, opened in its former location.

Son of Lope Diaz I de Haro, count of N√°jera (b. 1126‚Äì1170) and of countess Aldonza. He was a first rank magnate in the kingdom of Castile under King Alfonso VIII (1158‚Äì1214). He played a decisive role in the rise of the Haro dynasty, as well as in the construction of the nobiliary identity of his group, who was to dominate the Castilian political society during the whole 13th century. A publicity strife around this key figure between his successors and the monarchy, in a moment of deep political troubles, led to the elaboration of his dark image and his golden legend at the end of the 13th century, and the invention of his opposite nicknames.Ghislain Baury, \\"Diego L√≥pez 'le bon' et Diego L√≥pez 'le mauvais' : comment s'est construite la m√©moire d'un magnat du r√®gne d'Alphonse VIII de Castille\\", Berceo, n. 144, 2003, p. 37-92. http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=698041 Role at Alfonso VIII's court and exile strategy He did not attend the royal court with any regularity before 1178, maybe because of the influence exerted by the magnates of the Lara family. Between 1179 and 1183, he went into exile in Navarra. He went back to the Castilian court in a strong position, obtaining the office of alf√©rez, standard bearer, one of the two most prestigious with that of great major-domo. The rise of his parents in the neighboring kingdom of Le√≥n let him catch sight of better opportunities in 1187, when his sister Urraca L√≥pez married King Fernando II. Thus he left Castile, but the good fortune of his family in Le√≥n did not survive the king's death, the following year. He retained sufficient credit in Castile to negotiate his return with favorable conditions: he was given back the office of alf√©rez and all his governments. In charge of the rearguard, he took part in 1195 in the battle of Alarcos against the Almohads, and the defense of the territory after the Castilian rout. The king put him apart from 1199 on, depriving him of the office of alf√©rez for the benefit of count √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara. He went into exile a third time between 1201 and 1206, offering his services to Navarra and Le√≥n. He had nevertheless made himself indispensable for the Castilian sovereign. In his first will, in 1206, Alfonso VIII recognized having wronged the magnate, and tried to repair the damages. When Diego L√≥pez decided to come back in Castile in 1206, Alfonso VIII gave him back his full confidence as his alf√©rez, before handing over the office to √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara again in 1208. That very year, Alfonso VIII named Diego L√≥pez one of his five executors. In 1212, the king entrusted to him one of his three armies in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, that allowed the Christian kingdoms to get rid of the power of the Almohads in al-Andalus. The chronicler Juan de Osma asserted that the king had made him the future regent of the child-king Henry I. But Diego L√≥pez II died a few weeks before Alfonso VIII. Governments His first exile of 1179-1183 allowed his to recover the territories his father had ruled, La Rioja, Old Castile and Trasmiera. He also obtained Asturias (of Santillana) and the Bureba. After his second exile, he extended even more his area of influence in Northeastern Castile, to the point of ruling \\"from Almaz√°n to the sea\\" (1196). In 1204, in order to urge him to come back in Castile, Alfonso VIII acknowledged his ownership of the whole of Bizcaya, a Basque territory his ancestors had ruled back in the 11th century. This instrument may have meant the definitive conversion of this government into an inalienable fief, that would be the territorial basis of the Haro during the whole 13th century. He added Durando in 1212, a gift of the king no long after the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. He took a decisive step towards the patrimonialization of many of those governments, sharing them with his elder son, Lope D√≠az II de Haro. Lope thus received the governments of Old Castile in 1210, Asturias de Santillana in 1211, and √Ålava en 1213. Construction of dynastic identity Diego L√≥pez II strengthened the part of the head of family among his clan, permitting the shift from the \\"horizontal\\" conception of kinship to the \\"vertical\\" system of dynasty. He was the first of his family to use an apellido or family name, that notaries start to attribute to him in documents from 1184 on. Mythified character Diego L√≥pez II's memory quickly underwent attacks. As soon as 1216, during the regency of the Lara brothers, when Lope D√≠az II was trying to play a political role, the royal chancellery issued a charter judging him a bad lord. Diego L√≥pez's image constructed around 1240‚Äì1241 by the chronicler Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada, Toledo's archbishop, who had known him personally, was already very ambiguous. He criticized his exile strategy that led him to face his king on the battlefield. The tombs of Diego L√≥pez and of his wife Toda P√©rez, in the cloister of knights of the abbey of Santa Mar√≠a de N√°jera, were both realized during the second half of the 13th century. They bear testimony of the specific interest of the Haros for this founder ancestor. During 1270‚Äì1280, when Lope D√≠az III was brought against King Alfonso X of Castile-Le√≥n, in nobiliary rebellions ever more open, intellectuals from the court denigrated the reputation of Diego L√≥pez \\"said the Good\\", to whom the responsibility of the defeat of Alarcos was for the first time attributed. Writers supporting the Haros invented in this period an equivalent myth to justify Diego L√≥pez II's attitude and to charge the monarchy. The story of the Jewish girl from Toledo, which explains the rout at Alarcos with the sins of Alfonso VIII, appeared towards the end of the 13th century. During 1340, the books of the Portuguese count Pedro de Barcelos, the Cr√≥nica Geral de 1344 and the Livros de linhagens definitely turned the biography of Diego L√≥pez II into a myth. This author relates episodes allegedly historical, but similar to well known literary themes from Brittany (Arthurian romances) and French epic. He converted him into an ambiguous character, in a pseudo-historical attempt to synthesize his dark image and his golden legend. In the middle of the 15th century, Lope Garc√≠a de Sal√°zar, in his Cr√≥nica de Vizcaya, finally imagined the nickname \\"the Bad\\" to explain the contradictions in his biography. His memory suffered later other deformations, according to the interests of the 16th-century genealogists working for the nobility, and, from the 17th century on, of Basque historians. This time, it was the myth of the \\"independent seigneury\\" of Biscaya that was at stake between Basque fuerists and later nationalists, and their contradictors, until the first half of the 20th century.  Marriage and children  He married first with Maria Manrique de Lara, fourth daughter of Manrique Perez de Lara, I se√±or de Molina. Their son was: * Lope D√≠az II de Haro ‚Äì succeeded his father as se√±or√≠o de Vizcaya. He married secondly with Toda P√©rez de Azagra, daughter of Pedro Rodriguez de Azagra and Toda (or Tota) Perez, and had several children: * Pedro D√≠az ‚Äì lord of C√°rcar thanks to his mother and his maternal grandparents. * Urraca D√≠az ‚Äì married count √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara (died 1218). * Aldonza D√≠az ‚Äì married Ruy D√≠az de los Cameros. * Mar√≠a D√≠az ‚Äì married count Gonzalo N√∫√±ez de Lara (died 1225). * Teresa D√≠az de Haro ‚Äì married her cousin, Infant Sancho of Le√≥n, son of King Fernando II and Urraca L√≥pez de Haro * Menc√≠a D√≠az ‚Äì married Alvaro D√≠az de los Cameros.

Biography Couwenbergh was born in Delft. His father Gillis was a silversmith, engraver, and art dealer from Mechelen. Gillis had moved to Delft before 1604 where he married Adriaantje Vosmaer, the sister of the flower painter Jacob Vosmaer. Christiaen learned to paint from Johan van Nes,Kristiaen van Kouwenberch biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature and then entered the Guild of St. Luke in Delft in 1627. He then travelled back and forth to Italy. After his return, he settled in The Hague where he joined the Confrerie Pictura in 1647 and became deacon in 1649. He specialized in large historical allegories as wall decorations, often with life-sized nudes. He not only painted, but also produced drawings and designs for tapestries. His patrons were Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, among other royal admirers, for wall decorations at Huis ter Nieuwburg, Huis ten Bosch and Huis Honselaarsdijk. Queen Christina of Sweden purchased a series of tapestries designed by him. He later moved to Cologne between 1654-1656, where he later died. He is known for portraits and historical allegories and is judged to be one of those influenced by Caravaggio.

The group relocated to Still River, a village in the town of Harvard, Massachusetts.

History Cambridge In 1940, Catherine Clarke and several associates founded the St. Benedict Center in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a student center for students attending college in the Boston area. Leonard Feeney, S.J., became chaplain at the center in 1945. Feeney held rigid views regarding the doctrine Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus (\\"outside the Church there is no salvation\\"). Feeney criticized Boston Archbishop Richard Cardinal Cushing for, among other things, accepting the church's definition of \\"baptism of desire\\". In January 1949, a number of individuals who attended the center formed, under Feeney's guidance, an unofficial religious community.

In light of his controversial behavior, Feeney's Jesuit superiors ordered him to leave the center for a post at the College of the Holy Cross, but he repeatedly refused, which led to his expulsion from the order.

As an IFC, REC can also issue Infrastructure Bonds and raise funds up to US$500M through External Commercial Borrowing in a year. IPO & FPO History Early years REC was set up in July 1969, in the backdrop of a critical drought situation facing India in the late sixties. The company‚Äôs initial mandate was mainly to help State Electricity Boards energise pump-sets across the country to boost agriculture and overcome the crippling impact of three successive years of deficient monsoons. The company also provided finance to accelerate the pace of rural electrification in the overall context of planned programmes for increased agricultural production. Besides finance, REC also offered appraising, consultancy, technical support and monitoring of projects, to assist State Electricity Boards/Power Utilities, Rural Electric Cooperatives and other such institutions. Post-Liberalised India (1990s) Liberalisation by the Government of India (GoI) in 1991 saw introduction of amendments to existing laws and reform measures enabling the private sector to participate in large-scale in manufacturing industry, services industry and infrastructure. Sectors like power, airports, seaports, roadways, projects were identified for private participation, and nodal agencies were set up to do the initial spade work and later hand over such projects to private players through competitive bidding routes. In April 2006, GoI identified 14 transmission projects worth 200 billion for development by 2012. REC was identified as one of the two GoI-appointed nodal agencies for transferring identified projects to private developers. REC also started extending loans to manufacturers of T&D; equipment. 2000‚ÄìCurrent Till 2000, REC focused on the Transmission and Distribution aspect of power, with projects for household electrification in rural and semi-urban areas, area electrification in tribal/ dalit areas, intensive electrification, and system improvement projects based on strengthening and improving transmission, sub transmission and distribution systems. REC‚Äôs portfolio of Generation projects constituted mainly Mini/Micro Generation Projects up to 25MW capacity till 2000. In June 2002, the mandate of REC was expanded to include financing of all generation projects without limit on size or location. Today, financing of Generation projects has become a major thrust-area of operations for REC, also attracting majority of its private sector borrowers. Since 2005, REC has been appointed nodal agency by Ministry of Power for Government of India scheme Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana aimed at building rural electricity infrastructure and household electrification towards the National Common Minimum Programme goal of access to electricity for all. Under the scheme, 90% capital subsidy is provided by Government of India for overall cost of projects. Cumulatively till FY10, works in 190,858 villages have been completed and free connections to over 10 million below poverty line (BPL) households have been released. The REC is the nodal agency under the newly launched SAUBHAGYA Yojana by the present Modi government.  Philanthropic Activities  During Corona Pandemic, REC tied up with TajSATS to provide nutritious food to 300 frontline workers daily. It has distributed 4.58 lakh kg of foodgrains, 1.26 lakh meal packets, 9,600 litres of sanitisers, 3,400 PPE kits and 83,000 masks to fight coronavirus pandemic. REC Institute of Power Management & Training (RECIPMT) In 1979, REC established a national training institute in Hyderabad for the development of techno-managerial skill and efficiency in State Electricity Boards (SEBs), Distribution Companies, Rural Electric Cooperatives and other Power Utilities, and also to conduct in-house training programmes for REC‚Äôs employees. CIRE also served as a platform for association with other institutions towards a common goal of Rural Electrification (RE) and rural energy development. Today, RECIPMT conducts regular programmes on various aspects of Transmission and Distribution for national and international executives in the power sector, including seminars participated by both private and public utilities. Programmes focus on adoption of innovative and cost effective modern technologies, training in both conventional and non-conventional energy areas and practical demonstrations via an in-house Energy Park. Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) EESL is a joint venture (JV) with 4 power PSUs ‚Äì REC, Powergrid, NTPC, and PFC for implementing energy efficiency projects, promoting usage of energy efficient appliances, promoting the concept of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) etc. Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) REC is an equity partner in Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), India‚Äôs first nationwide, automated, and online electricity trading platform (power exchange/ electricity market), among other reputed investors like IDFC, Adani, Reliance Energy, Lanco and Tata Power.

The lake sits at an elevation of about , and has an area of and a mean depth of . The northern and western shores are steep and rocky, whereas the southern and eastern shores slope gently with mudflats and coastal plains. Geology and geography Early research described Lake Er√ßek as having been formed through volcanic activity; however, recent research indicates that it is a tectonic lake. The lake's basin was formed by north‚Äìsouth trending faults during the Upper Pleistocene. It appears that the lake did not rise much above its current level during the Upper Pleistocene and Holocene, based on examination and radiocarbon dating of core samples of lake sediments. Research suggests the lake did not overflow its basin during this period. The lake's main inflow is from the Memedik √áayƒ± (also known as the B√ºy√ºk√ßaylak Deresi), which enters via a broad fan at the west of the lake. The Karasu river, which rises along the Iranian border, passes within of the northwest shore of the lake and is separated only by a low ridge, but it does not enter the lake and continues west to enter Lake Van northwest of the city of Van. Natural history Birds Lake Ercek is an important site for breeding and migrating waterbirds. Between 18 and 39 endangered white-headed ducks were recorded at the lake in 2000, including two or three breeding pairs. Other birds recorded as breeding at the lake include the Kentish plover (75‚Äì85 pairs) and the greater sandplover (10‚Äì15 pairs). The lake is also used in passing by the ruddy shelduck, common shelduck, black-necked grebe, pied avocet and gull-billed tern. In 2020 it was reported that 177 different types of birds have been seen at the lake, 71 of them live there the whole year.

It was recorded in the fall of 2009 and was released on January 26, 2010 through Fearless Records. The album is considered that of a rock opera because of its in-depth story. Milke and Lee have both stated that the idea of writing an album based upon their own authored story has been present with them since the band's first release, Try This with Your Eyes Closed. Before the release of A Place Where the Sun Is Silent, The Emptiness was Alesana's best-selling album at the time, claiming the 68th position on the Billboard chart upon its release. Background and concept The Emptiness is unique in being the first work by Alesana to have official singles: \\"To Be Scared by an Owl\\" and \\"The Thespian\\". On November 23, after showing teaser versions of the song, the band digitally sold \\"To Be Scared by an Owl\\" on their website. The second single \\"The Thespian\\" was released two weeks later in the same fashion, shortly after the filming of its music video. The Emptiness became available for pre-order on iTunes on January 14 and the full album was leaked on January 21, five days before it released.http://www.fearlessrecords.com/viewband.php?band_id=32 It debuted at #68 on the Billboard 200 chart.[ The Emptiness Album Info]. Billboard.com. The album differs from the previous albums musically. After the line-up confusion of 2009, Adam Ferguson left the band and Jake Campbell, who had temporarily replaced Shane Crump on bass guitar, became the new guitarist. Though Campbell increased the amount of dual guitars played throughout the album, he did not provide any of the vocals Ferguson had in the past. However, the album features more guitar solos than their previous releases. Although the former albums have references to mythology of different cultures, this is the band's first concept album where the story is not based on anything else. While touring in Europe, Shawn Milke and Dennis Lee decided to create a horror theme for their third album as well as using Edgar Allan Poe as an influence for their work‚Äîmore specifically, the poem \\"Annabel Lee\\". Faint references are also made in the liner notes to \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" and \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" in that it describes a body hidden under the bricks in the main character's basement, in comparison to the heart under the floorboards and the man behind the brick wall. In an interview, Milke included Stephen King, David Lynch, and the film Friday the 13th as further influences for the story. The story that The Emptiness revolves around was written by Lee and Milke. It is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's last poem \\"Annabel Lee\\". The story is said by the band to be set in the onset of the 20th century and is expounded greatly in the liner notes album. The central character of the story, a sketch artist known simply as \\"The Artist\\" wakes up one day to find his lover, Annabel, dead, lying beside him. Heartbroken and terrified, he buries her in his basement and flees. He wanders aimlessly until he comes to a tavern, where he hears the sounds of merriment and laughter. He decides that if he can't be happy no one can and slaughters everyone in the tavern. After wandering through many places and finding Annabel's killer, \\"The Thespian\\", at the end of the story The Artist finally comes face to face with him to fight to the death. He is stabbed in his side with a dagger and finds himself in a room with Annabel holding a dagger in hand. From here on the story's point of view switches from The Artist to Annabel where she explains that The Artist had slowly been sinking into madness all this while, as he became more and more withdrawn and his sketches more and more violent. Though she loved him, in the end she had to take his life in the attempt to defend herself from him. The track listing and album artwork was released on a bulletin from Fearless Records on punknews.org, and a news post on their official site. Their tour name \\"You'd be Way Cuter in a Coffin\\" was originally the title for their first track.http://underthegunreview.net/2010/01/22/interview-alesana/ Two string quartet compositions by Shawn Milke (\\"Interlude 3\\" and \\"Interlude 4\\") appear after tracks 6 and 10 and are available for individual purchase on iTunes. Two singles were released for the album. \\"To Be Scared by an Owl\\" was released on November 23.Fearless Records posts on PunkNews.org \\"The Thespian\\" was released shortly afterward, on December 8.Announcement on AlesanaOfficial.com A music video for \\"The Thespian\\" was filmed during the winter of 2009 and was released on March 17, 2010. Story behind The Emptiness Shawn Milke stated; \\"The Emptiness is an idea that my co-vocalist and co-creator Dennis Lee and I have had since the days of recording our first EP, Try This With Your Eyes Closed. We've spent our career thus far basing our songs and lyrics on the works of some of our favorite authors and literature of the past (i.e. stories in Greek mythology, fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm) and some chosen contemporary screenwriting (i.e. Heroes, The Princess Bride). However, even back when we first started writing together, he and I always talked about writing our own story that we could bring to life through one of our records. The Emptiness is that dream come true. Writing a story has to begin somewhere, it has to have its roots planted in some sort of inspiration. For Dennis and myself, that inspiration rested within the stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe. In hindsight, this was a match made in heaven. Poe was a master of weaving words that could be so horrific and yet eerily beautiful all at once, and his final resting place is in Baltimore--the birthplace of Alesana and where we relocated to write this story. The Poe piece that stood out to us the most was actually the final composition ever published in his career--a poem called 'Annabel Lee.' Some believe that his wife, Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe, inspired it but that has never been verified. The key point that we found interesting in 'Annabel Lee' was its theme.

It is a two- cylinder, simple, non-condensing, coal-fired, superheated, ‚ÄòTen-wheel‚Äô 4-6-0 express passenger steam locomotive. It is one of the four P class (later C32 class) locomotives that have been preserved. Construction 3265 was built by Beyer, Peacock & Co in Manchester, England in 1902 entering service as P584. It was renumbered as 3265 in the 1924 renumbering scheme.Powerhouse Museum collection - Steam Locomotive No. 3265 3265 is the only surviving member of its class with an original low frame. In service The locomotive was first introduced into service painted black in 1902 as a saturated locomotive with slide valves. It was used for express passenger trains. In mid-1933, along with other P classes, it was converted to a superheated locomotive with new cylinder and steam chest castings that incorporated piston valves. It was released from workshops in September 1933 and painted maroon and it received the nameplate Hunter, named for the main river in the Hunter Valley. It only carried this nameplate until locomotive 3608 received it in 1934 and took over the Northern Commercial Limited express to Newcastle. The nameplate was preserved by Rail Transport Museum (NSWRTM). New reproduction nameplates have been cast and placed back on the locomotive. 3265 was used extensively with carriage sets CUB 80 and CUB 81 for Northern Commercial Express work at this 1933-34 period. After being replaced in 1934 from this work, it continued to work all manner of trains from express to country mixed and shunting work. It remained maroon and based at Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot from 1933 until 1936 after which it reverted to black livery. 3265 was overhauled and modified many times during its long and continuous service life. The loco was withdrawn from service in 1968 and was moved to the Enfield Locomotive Depot with the rest of the preserved locomotives owned by NSWRTM, Lachlan Valley Railway and other museums. In 1975 it was towed to Thirlmere for storage till 1988. Whilst in storage at Thirlmere, RTM volunteers wirebrushed 3265 and repainted it black. Restoration 3265 was towed to the former Eveleigh Railway Workshops in 1988. In 1998 a thorough restoration commenced. Most of the overhaul was carried out by a dedicated team of tradesmen working as volunteers and several conservators from the Powerhouse Museum. This team also worked on restoring 3830. 3265 returned to steam, having its first trial run from Eveleigh to Penrith and return on the evening of 2/3 July 2009. It then worked three other trial runs, with one to Springwood and two to Gosford. Preservation On 20 September 2009, 3265 was publicly relaunched back into service and made three Mainline steam runs to Bankstown celebrating its return to steam after an absence of over 40 years off the rails. Since then 3265 has worked 3 tours, 1 to the Robertson's Railway Station Fair, a special charter to Hurstville station and a NSWRTM trip to the Zig Zag Railway along with 3526 and 3642. After this trip, 3265 was transferred to the NSWRTM. In subsequent years the locomotive has taken part in the Hunter Valley Steamfest's 'Great Train Race' from Newcastle to Maitland. The Taree and Gloucester Railway Centenary 2013 and Sydney Great Train Expo 2013 at Central station.

Originally a two-store company owned by Food Resources Inc., it was purchased by PepsiCo in 1982 and franchised to various operators, including Food Resources in California and Arizona, and Calny, Inc. in the Seattle area. At its peak, La Petite Boulangerie had at least 140 locations, including Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, Sacramento, and a small number of bakeries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In August 1986, Food Resources sued PepsiCo, alleging that it was misled about La Petite Boulangerie's sales and profit potential. Calny filed a similar lawsuit in March 1987. The Calny suit was resolved with PepsiCo's purchase of Calny in November 1987, which also gave it control of Calny's 142 west coast Taco Bell locations. The chain was purchased by Mrs. Fields Original Cookies, Inc. on March 31, 1987 for $15 million. The chain was then acquired by InterWest Partners in July 1993 with a goal of converting it to a chain of gourmet coffee-bakery cafes. The chain had 68 stores at this point, none of which were franchised. Java City purchased the chain from InterWest in May 1994.

After the war, he continued his studies, earning a master's degree in political science from the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1947 and a doctorate in 1951 from the University of Texas at Austin.Obituary, John W. Schwada, Clarence Courier, April 25, 1990 In the early 1950s, Schwada became an associate political science professor at Missouri. During this time, he received a grant from the Ford Foundation to study the development of teaching material in the field of international relations. In June 1957, he became a consultant to the state of Missouri's Division of Budget and Comptroller and helped it revise its budget policies; the next year, he was appointed by Governor James T. Blair, Jr. as state comptroller and director of Missouri's budget. He resigned from the position in 1961 to return to the faculty of the university.Jefferson City Daily Capital, June 8, 1961: 4 In 1964, Schwada returned to Columbia to serve as the chancellor of the University of Missouri. He was the 15th chief executive of the Columbia campus and the first to bear the title chancellor after the creation of the four-school University of Missouri System. In Schwada's final year at Missouri, on May 8, 1970, a student revolt prompted by the murder of four students at Kent State University stormed his office and briefly took over campus. In December 1970, Schwada announced his resignation from the University of Missouri, in order to become the thirteenth president of Arizona State University beginning in July 1971. His inauguration, in March 1972, was marked by yet more student protests when MEChA led 80 students in a demonstration against what they believed to be discriminatory university policies. During his decade-long administration, university enrollment jumped from 26,000 to 40,000. Schwada supervised the construction of new athletic venues including the University Activity Center and Packard Stadium, and during his tenure ASU joined the Pacific-10 Conference. Academically, new buildings for life sciences, physical sciences and communication arts were also erected, and the College of Public Programs was established. During Schwada's decade as president, ASU awarded more degrees than it had in its entire previous history. In 1981, Schwada retired and was succeeded by J. Russell Nelson. Schwada died on April 19, 1990, in Phoenix, after a brief illness. He had two children with his wife Wilma, a daughter and a son. In 1995, a building on campus, the Classroom Office Building which houses lecture halls and some offices, was renamed in his honor.

Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. v. Like many early European Documentalists, Briet embraced modernity and science. However, her work made a difference to modernism and science through the influence of French post-structuralist theorists and her strong orientation toward humanistic scholarship. She subsequently ushered in a second generation of European Documentation and introduced humanistic methods and concerns, especially semiotics and cultural studies, to information science.Day, Ronald.

Although Briet had been highly regarded throughout much of her career‚Äîthe Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur was conferred on her in 1950 ‚Äî she was largely forgotten in her later life, until her death in 1989, when scholars found a renewed interest in her ideas. Today scholars often credit Briet as a visionary, having laid the foundation for contemporary frameworks and methodologies in information science roughly 50 years earlier. \\"Her modernist perspective,\\" writes Michael Buckland, \\"combined with semiotics, deserves attention now because it is different from, and offers an alternative to, the scientific, positivist view that has so dominated information science and which is increasingly questioned.\\"Buckland, Michael. (2006). \\"A Brief Biography of Suzanne Ren√©e Briet.\\" In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet & H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2. Early life Suzanne Briet was born in Paris, France on 1 February 1894, coming of age at a time of great social change and economic loss in France after World War I. Although Briet grew up in Paris, she remained attached to her birthplace and ancestral home. Briet was only 20 at the outbreak of the war. Ardennes was the pathway of German armies invading France, and during the hostilities her uncle was deported, his village was invaded, and her grandfather's house was destroyed. Historians have suggested that perhaps because of her experiences during the war, as well as her travels to England as a child, Briet took an early interest in the League of Nations, sitting in on some of the sessions held in Paris, and the founding of other international organizations. Briet's mother expected her to become a teacher. Briet's family sent her to Ecole de S√®vres, an elite women's school for training secondary school teachers, where she earned a degree in history and qualified to teach English and history. After teaching in Algeria from 1917 to 1920, Briet pursued a career in librarianship.Buckland, Michael. (2006). \\"A Brief Biography of Suzanne Ren√©e Briet.\\" In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet & H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1. She studied with Louis Barrau-Dihigo at the Sorbonne, who was apparently so taken with Briet's talents that \\"when Briet explained that she could only participate on Saturday, he changed the time of the course to accommodate her.\\" At age 30 in 1924, Briet was one of the first of three women appointed as professional librarians at the Biblioth√®que Nationale. Career Briet's career at the Biblioth√®que Nationale witnessed major changes in the library profession. Briet played a central role in the \\"modern library\\" movement, which eschewed elitist traditions that had dominated many libraries in favor of \\"modern\\" ideas of librarianship. In addition to technological innovations, Briet saw the emergence of documentation as a distinct profession with its own techniques, standards and training. Women also entered the professional classes in France in increasing numbers during World War II, growing from only 10% of the library profession in 1927 to 50% by the end of the war. Her main achievements during these years were symbolic of her interest in service and modernization. Between 1934 and 1954, Briet created and supervised the Salle des Catalogues et Bibliographies, making available materials throughout France that had been previously restricted to most patrons. By 1931 she co-founded (with chemist Jean G√©rard) the Union Fran√ßaise des Organismes de Documentation, the French analogue of the American Documentation Institution, today known as the American Society for Information Science and Technology. During World War II, Briet witnessed many of her colleagues deported during the German occupation of Paris and others arrested as communists. Despite a climate of fear, censorship, oppression and physical hardship, Briet made sure to carry out the catalog and bibliographic services of the Biblioth√®que Nationale. During the war, Briet continued her interest in Documentation, even attending a conference in Salzburg, Germany, which was organized by German Documentalists. At the end of the war, Briet took on a larger role in a growing international documentation movement. In 1950, she prepared an international survey of education for librarians and documentalists commissioned by UNESCO and was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur. In 1951 Briet helped establish the Institut National de Techniques de la Documentation at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers. She was the founding Director of Studies and eventually the Vice-President of the International Federation for Documentation. That same year, Briet published her treatise Qu'est-ce que la documentation?, in which she outlines, in 48 pages, her philosophy of documentation, \\"pushing boundaries of the field beyond texts to include any material form of evidence. ('Is a living animal a document?' she asked.)\\"Buckland, Michael. (2006). \\"A Brief Biography of Suzanne Ren√©e Briet.\\" In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.

Her memoirs were published in 1979. She died in Boulogne in 1989. Impact on information science Briet published roughly 100 essays, books, and reports on documentation, library science, and history She took up many of the pressing issues of documentation in her day: internationalization, institutionalization, information or documentary overload, scholarly communication, science and technology studies, world peace, and international development. Briet had been deeply engaged in the documentation movement from the 1920s onward, bringing to it a deep understanding of culture and the humanities. Expanding on the techniques and technological ideas of earlier European Documentalists, such as Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine, \\"Briet understood that technology and culture were deeply connected. She saw society and, therefore, culture, as being re-shaped by technology. The techniques of documentation in aiding and shaping intellectual work were, in her view, both a symptom of, and contributing force within the 'industrialization' of knowledge workers. We can now see, in the impact of computers and telecommunications, how right she was.\\"Buckland, Michael. (2006). \\"A Brief Biography of Suzanne Ren√©e Briet.\\" In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet & H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 3. As one scholar notes, \\"Not again -- until Actor-network theory at the end of the twentieth century -- would a social network account of technical production, and specifically, documentary production, be articulated.\\"Day, Ronald. (2006). \\"'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?.\\" In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet & H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. vii. Briet's body of work points to the necessity to understand cultural categories, historical lineages, and the social forces that create and sustain information, urging scholars and information professionals to explore beyond the boundaries of their cultural specialization. Paul Otlet problematized the definition of document when he opened the possibility of any object, independent of the human intention behind its creation, to be a considered a document. Briet solves this problem with her argument that a document must be defined by its intentional use as such. She gives the example of an antelope‚Äîrunning wild in the plains, it is not a document, but captured and placed in a zoo, it becomes an object of study and thus a document. It operates, as Briet says it must, as ‚Äúevidence in support of a fact‚Äù.\\"What is a 'document'?\\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 48, no. 9 (Sept 1997): 804-809. An object's treatment as evidence is contingent not only on its own properties but on its very framing as a source of information. It must be organized into a meaningful relationship with other evidence in order to have the indexical power of evidence. According to one scholar, \\"One of Briet's most important insights was that individual documents may be interpreted in different ways by different people wishing to put them to different uses for different purposes. This variability of interpretation is characteristic of documents even at the level of individual words, and the different decisions made by different translators at the word level can have significant consequences.\\"Furner, Jonathan. (2008). \\"Review: What Is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. By Suzanne Briet. Translated and edited by Ronald E. Day and Laurent Martinet with Hermina G. B. Anghelescu.\\" Libraries & the Cultural Record 43.1, p. 102 Briet developed the notion of indice (literally \\"index\\") as not only pointing to an object but also reflective of the networks in which that object appears as a named thing, leading to a semiotics-inspired definition of \\"document.\\" Furthermore, Briet argued that techniques and technologies are expressions of a networked culture. One scholar explains the idea this way: \\"Information and communication technologies may introduce a 'new rhythm' to society and culture, but they themselves are a \\"symptom\\" of Western social development.\\"Day, Ronald. (2006). \\"'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?.\\" In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet & H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 55. Thus, technique and technology are historically specific and symptomatic of culture. Briet argues that documentation must respond by incorporating these symptoms and specificities of Western culture but also must incorporate \\"Western modernity's opposite trend toward global expansion.\\" Briet also saw knowledge as embedded and emergent in cultural and social production and saw modernity as the growth of networks of knowledge. Indeed, in an increasingly globalized world, Briet argued for documentation to take up the call of material necessity rather than be put into the service of culture or any one culture; that is, \\"documentation marks the importance of particular, more 'localized' or specialized cultures in terms of their material needs, their specialized vocabularies, and the techniques and technologies needed to provide documentary services to these groups.\\"Day, Ronald.

The group was first activated during the buildup for World War II as the 51st Pursuit Group. It was one of the first groups deployed from the United States after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, traveling west to India via Australia and Ceylon. It returned to the United States in December 1945 and inactivated. It was quickly reactivated on Okinawa and became part of the occupation forces. Later, during the Korean War, the group's aircraft were some of the first United States Air Force fighters to engage in combat operations over South Korea, frequently engaging enemy fighters in air-to-air combat. Overview The 51st Operations Group is the most forward deployed USAF operations group in the world, providing combat ready aircraft for the close air support, air strike control, counter air, interdiction, theater airlift, and communications in the defense of the Republic of Korea. Assigned Units The 51 Operation Group (Tail Code: OS) consists of the following squadrons: * 25th Fighter Squadron \\"Assam Draggins\\" (A-10AC) * 36th Fighter Squadron \\"Fiends\\" (Block 40 F-16C/D) * 51st Operations Support Squadron (OSS) History : For additional history and lineage, see 51st Fighter Wing World War II During 1941, trained in the United States for fighter operations. After the Pearl Harbor attack on 7 December, the 51st served as part of the defense force for the west coast. Operational squadrons of the group were the 16th, 25th, 26th and 449th. The group was deployed to India via Australia and Ceylon beginning in January 1942 and arriving in March, serving in the China Burma India Theater of World War II. It was assigned to Tenth Air Force and equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. The group defended the Indian terminus of the \\"Hump\\" airlift route over the Himalaya Mountains between India and China and airfields in that area. The group flew strafing, bombing, reconnaissance, and patrol missions in support of Allied ground troops during a Japanese offensive in northern Burma in 1943. After moving to China in October 1943 the 51st FG was assigned to the 69th Composite Wing of Fourteenth Air Force. The group defended the Chinese end of the Hump route and air bases in the Kunming area. Attached Japanese shipping in the Red River delta of Indochina and supported Chinese ground forces in their late 1944 drive along the Salween River. The group was reequipped with North American P-51D Mustangs in 1945 to defend the eastern end of the route over the Hump, and to guard air bases in the Kunming area. The 51st Fighter Group returned to India in the fall of 1945 and sailed for the United States in November. The group was inactivated on 13 December 1945. The group was reactivated at Yontan Air Base Okinawa in 1946 and moved to Naha AB when Yontan closed in 1947. The group was assigned to the Twentieth Air Force, 301st Fighter Wing. The group served as part of the occupation force and provided air defense for Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands until 1950. Korean War F-80C of the 51st Fighter-Bomber Wing taking off from Suwon AB with a JATO bottle North American F-86E-10-NA Sabres of the 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (51st) FBG over Korea. Identifiable is serial is 51‚Äì2742. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, elements of the 51st were dispatched first to Japan, then to South Korea. It entered combat service flying the Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star on 22 September of that year, when it moved to Itazuke Air Base, Japan to support the breakout of the U.S. Eighth Army from the Pusan Perimeter. For nearly 4 years thereafter, the 51st FIW played a key role in the defense of South Korea despite moving to four different locations within a year and operating under austere conditions. The wing moved to South Korea in October only to return to Japan in December, leaving combat elements behind. In May 1951, the 51st FIW moved to Suwon Air Base, southwest of Seoul, but retained maintenance and supply elements at Tsuiki Air Base, Japan, to provide rear echelon support. In November 1951 the 51st FIW transitioned to the North American F-86 Sabre with two squadrons (16th, 25th), adding a third squadron (26th) the following May. The group operated a detachment at Suwon AB, Korea, beginning in May 1951, and relocated there in October 1951, with maintenance and supply elements remaining in Japan until August 1954. The wing ceased combat on 27 July 1953. The 51 FIW's war record was impressive. Wing pilots flew more than 45,000 sorties and shot down 312 MiG-15s; this produced 14 air aces including the top ace of the war, Captain Joseph C. McConnell. The ratio of aerial victories to losses was 10 to 1. Unfortunately, the wing lost 32 pilots to enemy action; however, nine that became prisoners of war were repatriated later. Cold War On 1 August 1954, the 51 FIW returned to Naha Air Base to resume air defense coverage of the Ryukyu Islands. Operational squadrons were the 16th, 25th 26th FISs. At the same time, the wing demonstrated its mobility readiness in response to three regional crises. During the period when the 51st was stationed at Naha, Okinawa, it was called upon to fly cover for the National Chinese who were evacuating the mainland. The 25th went to Formosa and flew out of China in the central part of the island and provided assistance to the Seventh Fleet as well as flying recon flights over the mainland of China. The group was inactivated on 25 October 1957 when the group's parent wing adapted the Tri-Deputate organization and the operational fighter squadrons were assigned directly to the wing. Return to Korea Since 1990, trained and took part in a series of exercises to maintain combat readiness for the air defense of South Korea.

The range was announced in 2009, for launch in early 2010, and was discontinued by the end of 2011. Sets included models of buildable underwater vehicles, as well as \\"heroic diver\\" and \\"shark warrior\\" minifigures. A ride based on the range was operated at Legoland Windsor Resort. Development Designer William Thorogood commented on the design focus groups that \\"it emerged that there were certain key icons the product simply had to include: propellers, dome cockpits, big lights, helmets, harpoons, torpedo-like weapons, tridents, giant squid, and evil sharks.\\" Story The Lego Atlantis theme backstory has been described on the Lego website and in the Lego catalogue. The Atlantis Crew were described as a deep sea salvage crew who searched the ocean for shipwrecks and treasure. The crew finds a clue to the location of the long lost Atlantis city, and then made it their mission to search it out, and uncover its mysteries. In the 2011 sets, the divers, having succeeded in finding Atlantis, were searching for golden treasures and gems. Before the Atlantis website was fully launched, a preview page, and online game, was published. The game involved the user in navigating through a small part of an \\"ocean\\" trench where they would come across an abandoned submarine, \\"the map to Atlantis\\" which allowed the user to download a preview map of Atlantis, and then finally an old journal that explained about an explorer, called Artimus Rhodes, who journeyed to Atlantis in 1919. Characters The sets introduce two groups of good and evil characters. The first was the Atlantis salvage crew of \\"heroic divers\\", led by Captain Ace Speedman. Also in the crew was marine biologist Dr. Jeff Fisher, First Mate Lance Spears, \\"Tech Expert\\" Axel Storm, and apprentice Bobby Buoy. Professor Sam Rhodes was also part of the team, but was described as having \\"not initially been part of the crew, so she tricks them into helping look for Atlantis\\". The evil characters were described as \\"Atlantis Warriors\\", and have human-like bodies with the heads of a sea creature. The three warriors were the \\"Squid Warrior\\" (with tentacles as well as a squid-like head), \\"Manta Warrior\\" (with the head of a manta ray), and \\"Shark Warrior'\\" who performed a shark attack. Finally, there was the \\"Portal Emperor\\", who resided over the portal to Atlantis. Sets There were a total of 19 sets, at a range of sizes and price points. The largest, Portal of Atlantis (8078) contains 1007 pieces, and instructions to build a portal to Atlantis, as well as six minifigures: three divers, a shark warrior, a squid warrior, and the portal emperor. Others included Seabed Scavenger (8059), Typhoon Turbo Sub (8060), Gateway of the Squid (8061), Atlantis Exploration HQ (8077), Shadow Snapper (8079), and Temple of Atlantis (7985). Other products As well as the Lego models, a number of other products, and merchandise, were created, to tie-in with the theme. These included wearable items such as a water gun, a \\"harpoon blaster\\", a trident, a shield, a collections of minifigure magnets, and keyring accessories. Lego Atlantis: The Movie is a brickfilm for the \\"Lego Atlantis\\" theme. The film was first shown on the Internet on Cartoon Network.co.uk on February 15, 2010. It was directed by Mark Baldo.

Based in Southern California, Pac Div started rapping together in high school. Originally an eleven-member crew, they shrank to three in 2005 when it became apparent a group with that many members wasn't feasible. Career Pac Div's first mixtape, Sealed for Freshness: The Blend Tape, along with their first video, F.A.T Boys, was released in 2006 to critic acclaim. Focusing on their lives as regular, young men growing up in Southern California, their music resonated with kids from all walks of life. From hipster to hood, there was something everyone could relate to in their sound. This universal appeal was the catalyst for their success and garnered them the real estate in numerous famed magazines, including Billboard, Rolling Stone, The Source, VIBE and XXL. It also gained the approval of hip-hop hotshots Ludacris, ?uestlove, Pharrell Williams, Talib Kweli, 9th Wonder and more. Their continued success drew international attention as they opened for big names like Nas, Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, Ice-T, Ludacris and N.E.R.D. A few years following the release of Sealed for Freshness: The Blend Tape, the group dropped two more mixtapes, Church League Champions and Don't Mention It. Church League Champions featured the now classic, \\"Mayor\\", while Don't Mention It contained the fan favorite, \\"Don't Forget the Swishers,\\" featuring rapper Chip tha Ripper. In the Spring of 2011, the trio teamed up with Grand Hustle Management and released their fourth mixtape, Mania!, hosted by DJ Don Cannon, featuring the hit single, ‚ÄúAnti-freeze‚Äù. With over a million downloads, Mania! is their most successful mixtape to date. In 2011, Pac Div left Motown Universal and released their debut album, The Div independently through their own label, The Div and RBC Records. With features from longtime friends, Blu Collar, Asher Roth, Casey Veggies and Skeme, the album was hailed as a huge success. Additionally, Pac Div appeared in their first nationally televised commercial for Phiten Athletics, featuring the group‚Äôs performance of their original song, Flexin, as well as appearances by NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Eric Gordon and Derrick Williams.

Italian ballet is the training methods and aesthetic qualities seen in classical ballet in Italy. Ballet has a long history in Italy, and it is widely believed that the earliest predecessor of modern-day ballet originated in the Italian courts of the Renaissance. Two predominant training systems are used to teach Italian ballet today: the Cecchetti method, devised by Enrico Cecchetti, and that of the La Scala Theatre Ballet School.  History (origins of il ballo, or ballet)  Ballet began during the Italian Renaissance court as an outgrowth of court pageantry,Kirstein (1952), p. 4. where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Court musicians and dancers collaborated to provide elaborate entertainment for them. Ballet was further shaped by the French ballet de cour, which consisted of social dances performed by the nobility in tandem with music, speech, verse, song, pageant, decor and costume.Bland (1976), p. 43. When Catherine de' Medici, an Italian aristocrat with an interest in the arts, married the French crown heir Henry II, she brought her enthusiasm for dance to France and provided financial support. These glittering entertainments supported the aims of court politics and usually were organized around mythological themes.Frances A. Yates, _The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century_, 2nd ed. (London: Routledge, 1988) A ballet of the Renaissance was a far cry from the form of theatrical entertainment known to audiences today. Tutus, ballet slippers and pointe work were not yet used. The choreography was adapted from court dance steps.Thoinot Arbeau, _Orchesography_, trans. by Mary Steware Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton (New York: Dover, 1967) Performers dressed in fashions of the times. For women that meant formal gowns that covered their legs to the ankle. Early ballet was participatory, with the audience joining the dance towards the end. Domenico da Piacenza was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students, Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo, he was trained in dance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work: De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi (On the art of dancing and conducting dances), which was put together by his students.Lee (2002), p. 29. Ballet, if not the first, produced and shown was Baldassare de Belgiojoso's balletto comico, also known as Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx's Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581) and was a ballet comique (ballet drama).Anderson (1992), p. 32. In the same year, the publication of Fabritio Caroso's Il Ballarino, a technical manual on court dancing, both performance and social, helped to establish Italy as a centre of technical ballet development. At first, ballets were woven in to the midst of an opera to allow the audience a moment of relief from the dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, Italian ballets in their entirety were performed in between the acts of an opera.Homans (2010), p. 207. Over time, Italian ballets became a more beloved and important part of theatrical life: ballet companies in Italy's major opera houses employed an average of four to twelve dancers; in 1815 many companies employed anywhere from eighty to one hundred dancers.Hansell (1980), Opera and Ballet, p. 200.

Criticisms The concept has been called a management fad, and derivative of management by objectives, itself derived from the business planning literature. One critic called it \\"the executive equivalent of paper-training your dog.\\", in Controversies While the book was becoming a best-seller, the Wall Street Journal ran an article exposing it as a heavily plagiarized document. The article asserted that almost half of the book was lifted directly from an article previously published by University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor Arthur Elliott Carlisle.The Liars' Club by Jon Entine, San Francisco Chronicle Blanchard and Johnson offered conflicting stories on their reasons for not citing the original author, including an insistence, later abandoned, that one of them helped Carlisle write the original article.

Historical accounts The most famous sufferer of this disorder was Nebuchadnezzar II, who in the Book of Daniel \\"was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen\\". Carl Jung would subsequently instance 'Nebuchadnezzar...[as] a complete regressive degeneration of a man who has overreached himself'.C. G. Jung, Analytical Psychology (1976) p. 123 According to Persian traditions, the Buyid prince Majd al-Dawla was suffering from an illusion that he is a cow, making the sound of a cow and asking that to be killed so that his flesh could be consumed. He was cured by Avicenna. Contemporary Boanthropy 'still occurs today when a person, in a delusional state, believes themselves to be an ox or cow...and attempts to live and behave accordingly'.M. S. Stanford, Grace for the Afflicted (2008) p. 122-3 It has been suggested that hypnotism, suggestion and auto-suggestion may contribute to such beliefs.Frank Harrel, Human Animals (2003) p. 293 Dreams may also play an important part. Jung for example records how a stubborn woman 'dreamed she was attending an important social occasion. She was greeted by the hostess with the words: \\"How nice that you could come. All your friends are here, and they are waiting for you.\\" The hostess then led her to the door and opened it, and the dreamer stepped through ‚Äì into a cowshed!'.C. G. Jung, Man and his Symbols (1978) p. 33 Freud had long since noted 'cases in which a mental disease has started with a dream and in which a delusion originating in the dream has persisted'.Sigmund Freud, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL 1) p. 113 R. D. Laing offers an autobiographical account of a brief reactive psychosis in which the protagonist had a 'real feeling of regression in time...I actually seemed to be wandering in a kind of landscape with ‚Äì um ‚Äì desert landscape ‚Äì as if I were an animal, rather ‚Äì rather a large animal..a kind of rhinoceros or something like that and emitting sounds like a rhinoceros'.R. D. Laing, The Politics of Experience (1984)p. 123 Totemism Eric Berne considered the first years of life as a time when the child 'is dealing with magical people who can perhaps on occasion turn themselves into animals,' and thought that even in later life 'a great many people have an animal...which recurs again and again in their dreams.

Derogatory cultural identifications of people 'like cattle, with their eyes always looking down, and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the dining table...they kick and butt at each other with horns and hoofs that are made of iron'B. Jowett transl., The Essential Plato (1999) p. 268-9 go back at least as far as Plato; while the 'direct identification of woman and cow'G. Legman, Rationale of the Dirty Joke I (1973) p. 217 in folk humor offers another potential source for delusional identification. Anthropological evidence such as 'a Burmese buffalo dance in which masked dancers are possessed by the buffalo spirit'C. G.

The presence of the fleur-de-lis, a stylized depiction of a flower and a traditional French symbol, demonstrates the city's French heritage and strong ties to France. History The City of New Orleans adopted its official flag in January 1918, having selected its design from nearly 400 ideas submitted to its Citizen's Flag Committee in preparation for the city's bicentennial celebration. The red, white, and blue flag emblazoned with gold fleurs-de-lis combined one proposal's suggested color scheme with decorative elements from another. The patriotic color scheme was suggested by Bernard Barry, then employed as an engraver at A. B. Griswold and Co., jewelers, and the fleurs-de-lis idea is attributed to Gustave Couret, a draftsman with the Diboll, Owen, and Goldstein architectural firm. The official flag of the City of New Orleans was named by the city council in January 1918. Symbolism The white field is the symbol of justice and the government, the blue stripe represents liberty, and the red stripe represents fraternity. In addition these are also the colors of the flag of France. The white field is five times the width of the stripes. The three fleurs-de-lis grouped in triangular form represent New Orleans under the principles of government, liberty, and fraternity.

He served as Bishop of Grand Island (1972-1977) and Bishop of Kansas City-St. Joseph (1977-1993). Biography John Sullivan was born in Horton, Kansas, to Walter and Mary (n√©e Berney) Sullivan. His father worked for the Electro-Motive Company. At age 10, he moved with his family to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He received his early education at the parochial schools of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, where he also served as an altar boy to Bishop Francis Kelley. He attended St. Benedict's College in Atchison, Kansas, for two years before entering Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1939. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Albert Lewis Fletcher on September 23, 1944, for the Diocese of Oklahoma City-Tulsa. Following his ordination, Sullivan became a curate at Holy Family Cathedral in Tulsa. He also served as director of Catholic Activities and as chaplain at the University of Tulsa. Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness originally intended for him to study canon law at the Catholic University of America, but instead assigned him as pastor of St. Mary's Church in Guthrie in 1947. While in Guthrie, he recruited college students to work as volunteers among the poor. Sullivan became pastor of St. James Church in Oklahoma City in 1959. From 1961 to 1968, he was national director of lay volunteers for the Catholic Church Extension Society. Returning to Tulsa, he was made pastor of the Church of the Madalene and episcopal vicar for Eastern Oklahoma. On July 25, 1972, Sullivan was appointed the fifth Bishop of Grand Island, Nebraska, by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on September 19 from Archbishop John R. Quinn, with Bishops John L. May and Charles Albert Buswell serving as co-consecrators. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary on September 21, 1972. After five years in Grand Island, Sullivan was named the sixth Bishop of Kansas City-St. Joseph on June 27, 1977. He was installed on the following August 17. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he retired on June 22, 1993. Sullivan later died at the Jeanne Jugan Center in Kansas City, aged 80.

The film visits former battlefields where over 100,000 Canadian soldiers lost their lives in World War I and World War II and examines Canadian military cemeteries and memorials from Hong Kong to Sicily. Production Fields of Sacrifice was produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) for the Canadian Department of Veteran Affairs. The film was originally intended to be a straightforward look at Canadian military cemeteries. Brittain, a staff filmmaker who had just completed the 13-part Canada at War series, decided on different approach. He combined stock footage with glimpses of the former battlegrounds a generation later and added his own commentary. Brittain shows that while these former battlefields are now peaceful and people are getting on with their lives, the sacrifices of Canadians are not forgotten. The film was narrated by Douglas Rain and shot in 35 mm. Theatrical release Fields of Sacrifice premiered in Ottawa in October 1963, attended by Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier. It would enjoy a two-year theatrical run, often shown as part of a double bill with the NFB's 70-minute drama Drylanders. It was broadcast on CBC-TV in 1965 on Remembrance Day. Significance Fields of Sacrifice is considered Brittain's first major film as director. It received an Order of Merit at the Canadian Film Awards.

It is thus likely that the death occurred some time after the exile order, although there is no clear date of Yang's death.) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, ruling Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) as its military governor (Jiedushi) in de facto independence from the imperial government from 831 to 834.  Early career  Virtually nothing is known about Yang Zhicheng's background, including when he was born or where his family was from. It is known that as of 831, Yang Zhicheng served as the deputy commander of the headquarters guards at Lulong Circuit, serving under the military governor Li Zaiyi.Old Book of Tang, vol. 180.  Seizure of Lulong Circuit  On a day in spring 831, when Li Zaiyi was feasting with an imperial messenger, Yang Zhicheng and a group of soldiers he gathered started a disturbance. Li Zaiyi and his son fled to Yi Prefecture (ÊòìÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei), in neighboring Yiwu Circuit (). As part of his takeover, Yang also killed the prefect of Mo Prefecture (Ëé´Â∑û, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), Zhang Qingchu (). Then-reigning Emperor Wenzong was initially concerned and considered his options, but at the urging of the chancellor Niu Sengru, who pointed out that for decades, Lulong had, in effect, not been under the control of the imperial government, and that Li Zaiyi himself had taken control of the circuit without imperial input. Emperor Wenzong thus allowed Yang to remain in control of the circuit and made him acting military governor (ÁïôÂæå, Liuhou). Later in the year, Emperor Wenzong made Yang military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244.  As military governor  As of 833, in addition to being military governor, Yang Zhicheng also carried the honorary title of acting minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). In 833, apparently, he demanded greater honor from the imperial government; in response, the imperial government bestowed the honorary title of acting minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu) on him. His representative at the capital Chang'an, the officer Xu Di (), arrogantly informed the chancellors, \\"The soldiers do not understand the system of offices at the imperial government. They only know that it is a promotion to go from being a minister to being Pushe [(ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, the head of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)], and they do not know that it is also a promotion to go from the ministry of public works to the ministry of civil service affairs. I fear that when the imperial messenger goes, he will not be able to leave.\\" However, the chancellors took no heed of Xu's threat. Subsequently, when the imperial messengers Wei Baoyi (), Jiao Fengluan (), and Yin Shigong () arrived at Lulong, to announce Yang's new commission, to deliver the spring uniforms to the soldiers, and to conduct an embassy to the Xi and Khitan tribes, Yang detained them. Yang then sent the officer Wang Wenying () to Chang'an, formally to thank for the honors and declining them; when the imperial government responded by giving Wang the commission certificate for the minister of civil service affairs, as well as a reply refusing to allow Yang to decline, Wang refused to accept them and left Chang'an without taking them. Eventually, the imperial government placated him later that year by naming him Pushe.  Defeat and death  In winter 834, there was another disturbance in the Lulong army, and Yang Zhicheng was expelled, along with the eunuch monitor Li Huaiwu (). The soldiers supported the officer Shi Yuanzhong to take over. As he went through Taiyuan, the capital of Hedong Circuit (), Li Zaiyi, who was at that time the military governor of Hedong, had him battered and wanted to kill him, and it was only at the intercession of Li Zaiyi's staff that Yang escaped death, but Li Zaiyi killed Yang's wife and followers. Further, because during Yang's time as military governor, Yang had dug up the graves of Li Zaiyi's mother and brother to take the treasures buried with them, Li Zaiyi made a request to the imperial government to kill Yang and take out his heart to be sacrificed to Li Zaiyi's mother; the imperial government declined the request. Subsequently, Shi submitted two sets of clothing that Yang had made, that were in designs only appropriate for an emperor, as well as other equipment that only an emperor should use. As a result, Yang was ordered exiled to the Lingnan region. On the way, when he got to Shang Prefecture (ÂïÜÂ∑û, in modern Shangluo, Shaanxi), another order was issued for his execution, and he was executed there.

Description The complex includes three buildings: the brownstone Gothic Revival church, the parish house, formerly a school, and a convent. The church was built in 1848‚Äì52, to a design by renowned Brooklyn architect Patrick C. Keely. The engineer for its construction was U.S. Army Lieutenant William S. Rosecrans who would rise to the rank of Major General in the American Civil War. In 1865 the school was built directly east of the church, also designed by Keely. During the 1880s, the church built two new buildings, neither of which are included in this nomination. A convent was built in 1880‚Äì81, designed by local architect Dudley Newton. In 1991 that building was moved from its site at Spring and Gidley Streets to its current location at 398 Thames Street, where it serves as the Admiral Fitzroy Inn.Statewide Historic Preservation Report N-N-3: The Southern Thames Street Neighborhood in Newport. 1980. Dudley also designed a rectory in 1886, which burned in 1921. A new rectory, designed by Ambrose J. Murphy, was built on the same site in 1924‚Äì25. In 1937, both church and school were altered by architect John F. Hogan. In 1967, in order to comply with Vatican II, East Providence architect Milton R. Kenyon further altered the church. The parish congregation was founded in 1828, and was the first Roman Catholic parish established in the state. In 1953 Senator John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier were married at St. Mary's. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

They talk about dreams that David has been having as Str√∏mberg and Harlan watch a video they had recorded while he was sleeping. On Co:pern:ica, they have commingled with Fain to make themselves higher beings, although there is a power called The Higher which governs those on Co:pern:ica. The dream is very strange and David has been visited by Firebirds (one of only the two creatures that live on Co:pern:ica) and they are seen blowing their special fire over him. It is later shown that a temporal rift had opened up and the firebirds came to close it up. Although Bernard Brotherton believes that David imagineered the firebirds, they come to the conclusion that someone, somewhere on another universe had been calling out to David. Eliza and Harlan travel back to their pod where they decide to commingle their fain and produce another child, a daughter for when David comes back. To be able to have a child on Co:pern:ica they must be assessed by an agent of the higher, one of the Aunts. They request the Aunt they had for David but she is otherwise engaged and is given Aunt Gwyneth. Whilst they are being assessed Harlan insults Gwyneth and she denies them to have a child but says that Eliza could become an Aunt. Eliza reluctantly agrees and the next day she is taken to the Dead Lands and begins to learn more about the world they live on. Gwyneth also states that Eliza spent her childhood with her and that she was brought back into the system at the age of five. Whilst Harlan is at work at the Ragnar Institution of Physics, he brings in data from the research on David and asks his partner Bernard to put the information into SETH, which we are led to believe is some sort of supercomputer. The equipment that they have set, is meant to open up a controlled rift and let someone pass through it almost like a teleport. Str√∏mberg suggests sending David to a librarium, which is a huge building going up past the clouds to be tutored by Charles Henry and have an 'adventure'. Eliza and Harlan drop David off there and they meet a young girl called Rosa who says that the Librarium is hers. She tells Harlan and Eliza that they may leave and Rosa and Mr Henry will look after David. After a meeting with Mr Henry, they both tell David that to get around the Librarium they have to think of where to go and picture it in their heads. David practices by finding the toilet and a wardrobe where he dresses a little like Rosa. David enjoys his time with a Rosa, they become friends whilst cataloguing the library for Mr Henry. Whilst they are cataloguing they ask Mr Henry how to get to and above floor 43, because although they have searched for it they have never been able to reach it. Mr Henry says they must work hard to be able to access the secrets of the upper floors and it is revealed that there is a huge Firebird eyrie up there. One day David and Rosa are teasing each other about a book each wanting to put it into their own collection when Rosa challenges David that when she throws the book out of the window whoever reaches it first will be able to catalogue it. When Rosa throws the book it hits her Firebird Runcey and David rushed down to help him telling Rosa to fetch Mr Henry. When Rosa and Mr Henry reach David they find Runcey gone and David has entered a state of Melancholia, because a seemingly evil large, Red Firebird named Azkiar finds Runcey and David, and the Azkiar flies away with Runcey. Rosa finds a book about Dragons which she accidentally mispronounces as 'drargones', and fearing that Str√∏mberg and Mr Henry will take the book from her, she runs for a place to hide. Rosa manages to find the door to floor 43 but the door is locked and there is no visible lock to the door. Gwyneth then appears and asks why she is trying to go up there and Rosa lies several times, Gwyneth asks about the dragon book and Rosa tells her. Gwyneth tells Rosa the correct pronunciation, but forbids her to read it. Then Gwyneth, who is visiting to check on David, demands to be taken to David and Mr Henry. At first Gwyneth wants David to be de:stroyed but Str√∏mberg steps in and says they should assess David as he is a very special ec:centric. Back in the Dead Lands, it begins to rain as Eliza finds clay and begins to model with it, eventually making an egg. The rain then becomes very strange as it is driving Eliza away, although when the drops fall on the ground they recreate images of dragons (long since died out on Co:pern:ica). Eliza finds them beautiful and then they start to scare her until she shouts 'I AM ELIZA!' and they turn away. Then the lead dragon, described as bony and almost human like to Eliza breathes over her. Eliza collapses into a heap. Sometime later, a group of Firebirds find Eliza and they are trying to take care of her, when they discover the egg and wonder how one could have gotten out of the eyrie. Two days later, Harlan, Bernard and Str√∏mberg are about to open up the rift when it cuts to Aunt Gwynteth in the Dead Lands. She finds a trail of stones leading towards some caves. Reaching the cave she sees that Eliza has created lots of clay dragons acting almost as guardians to the slope that they are on. Gwyneth furiously confronts Eliza about the heresy she has committed and Eliza shows that she has a baby daughter and cracked the family anomaly. Back at the Librarium, a fire bird named Aurielle, picks up the fire tear enclosed in one of David's own tears, a daisy chain that Rosa made for David earlier in the book and the egg that Eliza created. Aurielle thinks about these things as she flies back to her perch and looks at a woven tapestry that she likes, depicting the last scene of Dark Fire, where there are dragons, humans, the ix and darklings. Aurielle and the other fire birds know about the darklings which they call \\"the shadows of ix\\". The tapestry is apparently named Isenfire. As Aurielle is thinking about all of this another firebird comes along and warns them that a portal is opening somewhere and they need to be there. Rosa and Henry and the whole of Co:pern:ica feel the rift opening. Rosa has read and re-read the book about Dragons to David, after Str√∏mberg over- ruled Aunt Gwyneth. Rosa manages to figure out how to read Dragontongue and believes she knows how to get up to the upper floors, just as Harlan switches on the machine. Suddenly Rosa passes out and then when she wakes up, she finds David waking up as well, and they have discovered that they have aged about eight years. Part Two David and Rosa try to find out what has happened to the two of them and whether it is just the people inside the librarium, or everyone. Rosa says that just before David woke up there was something like a time quake. They talk for a while before travelling to the door and Rosa tries and fails to open the door. David has a go and effectively speaks in Dragontongue saying \\"sometimes\\" and the door opens. When they get through the door they find that all books are already ordered. David and Rosa look around and David finds a book entitled Alicia in the Land of Wonder (alternative to Alice in Wonderland). They both then see Azkiar, and they run, but not before they find that he was sitting on a plaque entitled 'FICTION'. David tells Rosa to go and find Mr Henry, which she does, and David runs off down the corridors of shelves until he gets cornered by Azkiar. Fearing that he will have to throw books at it he prepares to do so, picking up a Steven Kinge novel. But Azkiar does not attack David and instead looks at him puzzled. David takes the opportunity and walks away, and commingles with the book's auma. David leaves the floor and goes to Mr Henry's office, where Rosa is kneeling on the floor, and discovers that Mr Henry is now dead. Harlan steps through the door and they both see that they have all aged. harlan says that when he started his experiment, everyone connected to it aged and Mr Henry obviously died because of ageing. The experiment failed and Harlan was devastated by what he had done. Knowing that he will be arrested and taken away by Re:movers he gives David a micro:pen, that he says has all the relevant information that he needs. The re:movers come in. They assess Mr Henry and conclude that he died of natural causes. Aunt Gwyneth comes in and they see that she too has aged slightly. Gwyneth sees that Harlan passed David something and when she demands to see it, David quickly imagineers it into a gold wedding ring and explains his father wanted him to give it back to his mother. She explains that she is taking Harlan away and that Eliza has called for David to be released and brought back, where she and his sister are waiting for him. Gwyneth explains that Rosa cannot go, because she can only leave the librarium if she is called. Because her parents have died from the time quake and she has been officially declared an orphan, no-one can call her. Gwyneth states that the Librarium is under the Aunts control for now whilst they complete an evaluation and get a new curator. She summons two Aunts; Primrose and Petunia. Whilst David is walking away Rosa calls that if he does not stay with her, she will never let him come back. David promises that he will return and changes the ring back to the micro:pen. Meanwhile, up on floor 108 Azkiar has flown to Aurielle to tell her that he has seen humans on the upper floors. Aurielle asks whether it was Mr Henry and the answer is 'no', and Azkiar tells her it was David. This confirms that something has happened to everyone involved and connected to the experiment because even the fire birds feel and look different. After Azkiar has told Aurielle about the ageing incident, Aurielle tells him she must meditate on the matter and Azkiar, angry with her, flies up to the tapestry. Looking at it he sees two humans and makes the connection that two of the humans are David and Rosa, and that they were the ones who had been found on floor 43. Back at pod 42, David is settling in with his mother and sister although they display some sibling rivalry. Eliza quells this by saying that she loves them both the same. Eliza warns David not to mention Harlan in front of her and tells David that Penny was born from an egg and that Eliza has brought clay back with her. Eliza says that she saw lots of things outside of the Great Design and that they were flawed like Boon. One of the dragons, the ugly one, guided her toward the cave. Eliza had taken the clay with her and that was how she had created an egg which she left outside the cave, and then a dragon came down and kindled it for her. When Gwyneth came back she destroyed all of the guardian dragons. Eliza only just managed to bring back a small bit of clay without Gwyneth noticing. David goes to Harlan's study and finds the com:puter wiped. Using the memory stick he manages to find out what his father discovered, and also that fire birds tried to close up the rift, but something else was coming through. David is interrupted by Penny, who tells him that she has found a black fire bird feather and both Eliza and David tell her that there are no black firebirds. Penny gets upset, and goes and gets ready for bed. When Penny is ready, David goes up and starts reading Alicia in the Land of Wonder to her, imagineering the story with her so that the characters come to life. But something goes wrong and they see a mirror of another world (Liz's mirror in her bedroom) in it are clay dragons and a unicorn. St√∏rmberg carries him to bed. David wakes up two days later to find that Str√∏mberg has gone and that he cannot stay in one place for too long, because he has gone into hiding. David tells his mother that to find the answers that he needs he either needs to go to the Dead Lands, which he knows she will not let him do, or go back to the Librarium. David prepares to go back to the Librarium when Penny walks in and tells him about the night he read to her. David begins to remember, and Penny shows David a picture that she drew of what the White Rabbit changed into. David knows that are no creatures like this on Co:pern:ica, and wonders how she could have gotten the detail so right for it. Eliza tells David, before he goes that he needs to meet up with Str√∏mberg on Bushley Common in the evening. When David asks which evening, she replies any, and that he will know how to find David. David goes to the common and plays with a katt whilst he waits for Str√∏mberg to arrive. Str√∏mberg tells David that the society they are in is failing, and Aunts are plotting to overthrow the Higher and that the Higher resides in the Librarium. Str√∏mberg and Mr Henry believed that the Higher operates through the firebirds. They talk some more and Str√∏mberg is impressed that David and Rosa managed to get to the upper floors, whilst Stromberg and Mr Henry had tried for 20 years and failed. Before Str√∏mberg leaves, he urgently tells David that he must go back to the Librarium and retrieve the Book of Agawin which he believes will tell the whole history of Co:pern:ica and of Dragons, and then contact him. David tells Str√∏mberg of the story telling, and that his adopted imagineered character turned into a black fire bird. Str√∏mberg is confused, and then David tells him that when he slowed the video down of the experiment, he believes something came through and infected a normal fire bird and turned it black. Stromberg tells David that if this is true, then he must get to the Librarium that night, if possible and find the book. As Str√∏mberg walks off, David puts the katt down and walks off himself. The katt suddenly turns into Gwyneth, meaning that she has heard the whole conversation which was meant to be private. Meanwhile, back in the Librarium, Rosa is not getting on well with the Aunts. They at first make her clean out a room for them and will not let her order any more books. This frustrates her greatly. One of the demands is the Rosa must block out the window and to do this she has to use books, which breaks her heart and the Librarium itself does not like it. After she has finished the task the Aunts come in and rip pages out of the books and stuff them in the gaps between them. This is too much for Rosa who leaves running. Rosa wants to return to floor 43 but does not dare because Gwyneth found her easily the previous time. Rosa finds herself missing Mr Henry. Whilst Rosa is asleep, deserted even by Runcey, the firebirds who are worried because they have not seen a fire bird since the time quake, including Runcey come down to examine her changes, and they conclude that the girl in the picture (Zanna) and Rosa do match, although Rosa does not have the Mark of Agawin (Oomera). Aurielle decides it is now time to consult the Higher about this situation and flies up over 100 floors to be able to speak to him. Aurielle reaches the roof and thinks that it does not matter how many physical floors one must climb or fly, it is how determined they are and how much they need to get there. She flies onto a balcony and hears the Higher's voice speaking to her. Aurielle flies into the sensory matrix of the Higher known as the IS and speaks to him. The Higher calms Aurielle down and tells that what will be, will be, and that they allowed the science experiment to take place. The Higher also tells her that where there is order in the Eyrie, there is order in the rest of the world. Aurielle asks about the Isenfire, and the reply is that she always knew it was David, and she knows this is true. Aurielle now knows what to do. She must drive out the Aunts and bring David back so that he may be the new curator, and protect the Higher itself. The Higher tells her that Isenfire is upon them all. Finally, Aurielle tells the Higher about the egg that Eliza made, and the Higher replies, 'Beware of the thread.' When she asks what the thread is, the reply is, 'The thread is time and She will come from an egg.' Aurielle has one final question it is 'What is the Higher?', and the Higher tells her that it is pure Fain. The Higher tells her that she must become like a piece of bone that she found on the roof, and although she feels upset that her part is over, the Higher explains she will be an agent of the universe. Aurielle asks to see it, and she sees what fire birds will become. Not larger birds, not dragons, but they would have paws. Rosa also does not like the situation she is in. The Librarium is despondent and desolate and the Aunts have locked themselves in their room with a big sign saying, 'KEEP OUT.' Rosa knows that she needs to find out what is going on and so comes up with a plan, after finding a book about mushrooms (because all Aunts like mushrooms), she makes a mushroom dish that is secretly drugged, and Rosa knocks on the door. 10 minutes later, Rosa gains entry to the room. There is a strange digi:pad on the floor, and she picks up a book reads the information. Then the pad scans the book and it tells her the books auma level. Flicking through the book, Rosa is furious and distraught to find that it has been wiped completely. Rosa tells the fire birds to tie up the Aunts and wait for them to wake up. When they have woken, Rosa gets one of the fire birds to torture Primrose's feet, knowing that they will both feel it as they are twins. Rosa questions the Aunts and finds out that the pad is an auma scanner, and that they have taken the auma from almost every book in the room. Rosa asks if it can be put back, but the energy can only be transferred and Gwyneth is the one who knows what she is going to do with it. They confirm that once the auma has been harnessed, the Aunts will attempt to take over Co:pern:ica. The Aunts distract Rosa by imagineering David and thus enabling them to break free One Aunt manages to accidentally brand Rosa with the mark of Agawin. They then create a fire, which the three firebirds present cannot put out on their own and Aurielle tells Aleron to go and get the other fire birds who are already aware that the building is on fire. The Aunts manage to get the digi:pad by using their fain to catch it when Rosa throws it at the bed which is burning. When they switch it on it releases the auma into the room and there is nothing they can do and the Aunts run, the released auma travels into Rosa, through the mark of Agawin (or Oomara). On the window sill, Aubrey appears (the one who is the black fire bird) and the other fire birds are pleased to see her but puzzled as to her colour and the blood around her neck. More firebirds arrive and manage to put out the fire. Then suddenly, David climbs through the window to take control of the Librarium. Part Three Harlan and Bernard are being taken to the Dead Lands where they know their fain will not work. The two of them wonder how they are going to survive once they have been dropped off. They watch the taxi disappear and then check their surroundings. They believe they can see lights in the distance and sure enough six people reach them holding lights. One of the men introduces themselves as Matthew LeFarr and explains that he was brought to the Dead Lands because he asked too many questions in the wrong places. The men give them clothes and they decide to travel to the Isle of Alavon where there is a settlement of twenty two people including Harlan and Bernard. Whilst they walk, Harlan and Matthew talk, and Harlan believes that if Matthew is not the leader of the group, then he should be, because he has leadership qualities. After some time, they manage to reach a hill, and looking over it they see the Isle of Alavon. Matthew explains that this was where they believed Agawin used to reside. The group see a fire bird flying over head and many people race to catch it and Harlan goes with them to see what will happen. An old man, Roderic, is told to take Bernard back to the settlement. Bernard believes that the men are going to kill the fire bird. However, he manages to catch it when it flies to him, and Matthew tells him to put it onto the ground and turn its head away. The fire bird then cries its fire tear and a field of corn grows in its spot. Matthew congratulates Bernard, and says that the field will be called 'Bernard's field'. The whole party then goes back to the settlement where they settle in. Harlan and Bernard know that life will be hard outside the controlled Central but believe they can get along. They learn that fire birds have brought them a great many gifts including cooking utensils and crops. Matthew tells them that there will be a big meeting for everyone to get to know each other. After the meeting, Harlan asks about the tower up on the crest of Alavon and wants to journey up to it. Matthew agrees to take him and Bernard up to it, although warns that many of the tribes have gone mad since returning from the tower. The journey is uneventful up until the point, near the crest, when Harlan is taken over and is told to be wary of the \\"shadow of the ix\\". Harlan is then thrown down and the rest of the party wonder what happened to him, as they help him into the building. Harlan tells them about what happened, and says that the dragons name was \\"Gawain\\" but they say they can not see \\"Gawain\\" so reviled - he is a wandering spirit. They move to the central dais where there is a carving of a winged man and they manage to get the creator to show itself, appearing as a talon (like the one in Fire Star, The Fire Eternal and Dark Fire). The group then decide to come back down the hill to go back to the settlement, where Harlan tells everyone what happened up on the hill. He shows everyone the Creator, and then a darkling shows up and demands the Creator from Harlan, who at first denies it, but when he begins to fight it, Harlan drops it accidentally, and the darkling takes it off of him, and flies back to Co:pern:ica Central. Harlan reveals that he wrote Isenfire on the sheet of paper that LeFarr gave him and believes that it is what brought the darkling upon them. The man who went up the hill with him is called \\"Colm Fellowes\\" and Harlan asks him how to destroy the Re:movers, and he tells him that it is water. Harlan then comes up with a plan to get everyone back to Co:pern:ica so that he can protect David, by turning the tower of Agawin into a massive beacon. Many of the group are sceptical and believe that the Re:movers will not come, but agree to go along with the plan anyway. Meanwhile, the darkling travels back to Co:pern:ica and sees the fire in the Librarium. Landing on the window sill, the darkling prepares to take over Aurielle's body, but then gets seen and the fire birds question whether it is really Aubrey. The darkling flies up a few more floors to an abandoned level and prepares to wait another day before getting a new body. On this floor Gwyneth appears, she's still furious at Petunia and Primrose for their incompetence, sees the darkling then manages to capture it. She takes the Creator, and knows it is from a dragon. Gwyneth talks to the darkling and agrees to commingle with it. The Ix try to take over her body but Gwyneth just manages to break it up, warning the Ix that if it tries to do anything like that again, she will \\"destroy it piece by piece\\", and then the two of them share information. The Ix tells her that they are all part of something, and that three worlds are connected: Ki:mera, Co:pern:ica and a low plane world where Isenfier is taking place. Gwyneth asks what planet Isenfier world is called, and the answer is Earth. Part Four Gwyneth continues to interrogate the Ix while attempting to resist their attempts at a full control over her body (which she suppresses). The Ix share information about her concerning David Merriman. The Ix explain that David can alternate his auma through the three planes (Co:pern:ica, Ki:mera, and Earth). In basic words he lives an alternate reality on Earth different from on Co:pern:ica. In the conversation the Ix also explain to her about the power of the claw she took from the Ix, saying it acts as a creator that (as known from the previous novels) manipulates dark matter. It has the great power to bring upon whatever is written by the user. This proves true when Harlan managed to call upon the Black firebird possessed by the Ix by simply writing \\"Isenfier\\". The Ix also reveal that there are connections across the planes, one being a squirrel (presumably Conker from the previous Novels). The Ix then tell of Gwyneth being a connection as well to Gwilanna who died in the previous Novel before the Battle of Isenfier. Shortly afterward Eliza and Penny come to visit David and Rosa in the Librarium. Gwyneth is then caged up by an imaginereed cage when she starts to act unruly to their presence. After they are introduced to each other Eliza pulls out a clay Dragon that has a pencil and a pad to show to them. They commingle to bring it to life. The dragon comes to life and starts to write something on his pad. Before he is finished though a time rift suddenly appears and the Ix within Gwyneth (still posing as a cat) come to attack and attempt to kill David. David defends himself by somehow transforming into a bear where he attacks and defeats the Ix colony and seals the rift. After everyone settles themselves afterwards Aurielle (the cream- coloured firebird) upon seeing the Dragon on the table sees between it and the dragon that is on the Tapestry on floor 108 of the Librarium. Aurielle urgently tells David and Rosa to follow her with the clay Dragon to floor 108. Rosa is reluctant to bring David's sister Penny along with them but she ends up tagging along. This leaves Eliza with a very bitter Aunt Gwyneth to guard. Having nothing else better to do Gwyneth starts up a conversation with Eliza. Gwyneth tries to convince her to look at the book that David was looking at on the way out of the room and at the same time try to convince her to release her from her cage. Eventually Eliza does look at the book David went to and reveals that David was trying to look up what the clay dragon was trying to spell before the Ix attacked him. It is revealed to be the dragon's name Gadzooks. Gwyneth also reveals that she is Eliza's mother. She explains to her that her Father was the almighty Agawin himself. However Gwyneth has no idea what has happened to him even up to when she was brought into Aunthood. During Aunthood Eliza was later discovered to be eccentric but her Aunt Su:perior took pity on her and decided to put Eliza into stasis util it was time for Gwyneth to claim her. But that unfortunately never came and Gwyneth realised she would not need a mother so she decided to have her introduced into Co:pern:ica as an orphaned child. She would be simply watched over by Gwyneth. This explains why Eliza could not recall her memories of childhood clearly when asked to by Aunt Gwyneth. Gwyneth tries and tries to convince Eliza to free her. She also explains to her briefly about the Dragon claw found she found off of the Ix saying that she must go and claim it. She apparently hid it somehow without the Ix being aware. After a while she finally gets Eliza to open the cage and release her despite David's warnings not to listen to her. Meanwhile, David and Rosa continue to climb up the floors of the Librarium making their way towards floor 108. Rosa sees the remains of the egg being guarded on the floor having already hatched. David is quick to try to get downstairs fearing for Penny and Eliza's safety from whatever hatched from the egg. However Rosa manages to convince David to stay on the floor long enough for them to find the tapestry on the large table in the room. David looks closely at the Dragon's notepad in the tapestry using a tele:scope. He finds on the notepad the three line mark of Oomara and a faint word written on it saying \\"sometimes\\". This is apparently referring to Gadzooks writing the word during the finale of Dark Fire when everyone disappears in the end. They then turn their attention towards the book of Agawin which has somehow found its way to floor 108. David was sent by Str√∏mberg to read the book cover to cover to find out more secrets, possibly pointing towards the Librarium. The book is apparently split into several sections: The Flight of Gideon, The Battle of Isenfier, The Isle of Alavon, and The Ark of Co:pern:ica Eventually David and Rosa decide to proceed to the lower floors. They are then separated when the Librarium starts to undergo a strange transformation. All the books and everything on all the floors of the Librarium start to transform into and become consumed by woodlands, trees and vines that start to warp their way around the entire Librarium. In the process Rosa encounters a white horse. Its name is Terafonne. The reason for the transformation is revealed in the next chapter. While Rosa and David were up in floor 108 Penny is struggling to find the right book for herself down in floor 43 she catches a raindrop outside through the window while it is raining. The raindrop transforms into some sort of light and a girl younger than Penny appears and has wings. She calls herself Angel and it is obvious she is the parallel version of Alexa in Dark Fire. She offers to help her find a book and leads her to a point in the room and then disappears. The raindrop leads her to a shelf marked with the author that is David Rain from the previous books. There she pulls out his book Snigger and the Nutbeast, and when she opens it a squirrel jumps out of the book. At that moment Gwyneth appears behind Alexa holding Eliza captive within the cage that David imagineered. At that point the transformation of the Librarium begins. Gwyneth explains to Penny that she triggered the transformation by opening the book. She says that the Librarium is actually the infamous Ark of Co:pern:ica that is referred to in the Book of Agawin. The Ark was created during the Great Re:duction that formed the dead lands to protect all of the animals and wildlife of Co:pern:ica. As Gwyneth rambles on about the Ark and animals in it, Penny takes the chance to attack Aunt Gwyneth and take the cage holding Eliza with her. However Gwyneth uses her powers to summon forth a wooden spike through the floorboards to drop Penny dead in her tracks. Eliza urges her daughter not to resist her to prevent further harm to her. At that moment Penny tells Gwyneth of the winged girl she saw moments ago named Angel. Gwyneth is then introduced to Aurielle, Aleron and Azkair who have all transformed into small dragons. They attempt to burn Gwyneth with their fire but fail. The three of them cannot cause harm to the claw artefact that she holds and instead of harming Gwyneth they end up making her more powerful. She then uses the claw to knock back Azkair as he tries to attack her. Aurielle demands that Aleron keep Azkair put as she goes after Gwyneth, who has transformed herself into a Raven and has blended in with the flock circling the Ark that came with the influx of other animals that came into the Ark as a result of the transformation from the Librarium to the Ark. As the pursuit between them escalates into the higher floors of the Ark, Gwyneth finds herself in the sensory matrix Is; the domain of the Higher. When she arrives she arrives in a very icy world that looks somewhat like the works of the Arctic. Gwyneth lands next to a polar bear and transforms back to herself. Next to the polar bear are Angel and Rosa who is now riding Terafonne. The polar bear (apparently representing the Higher) says that all around her are flakes that are actually small fire stars. He encourages Gwyneth to take a fire star and join them. Angel apparently says she really wants Gwyneth to defect for them and to help them. However the Aunt has plans of her own. Her ambition to overthrow the Higher has completely suppressed any wishes for an Alliance with them. She threatens to destroy the bear with the claw that she holds. Little does she now that any malevolent intent with the claw will immediately cause it to turn against her. The Higher warn her of this but again her ambition to overthrow the Higher over-rules his negotiations. As Gwyneth is about to strike the claw indeed turns against her and throws her off of IS into the ocean below. The ocean has formed as a result of the excessive raining that has caused a flood and then an ocean. Harlan, Bernard and Lefar are victorious in their struggle with the Re:movers and have imagineered a boat to adapt to the changes going on around them. Harlan has also suffered injuries from the battle including the loss of an eye which is now covered by an eye patch. They pull Gwyneth from the water onto the deck of their boat (who is at the moment still alive). She wakes up coughing up water. Harlan who immediately recognises her demands they give her no help. However Lefar manages to convince him that even as bitter as she is she is still an Aunt and is to be respected. So with that they blanket her to keep her warm. In her dying breaths she says \\"My bo-dy is bro-ken but...nnn...my will...\\", revealing the fact she is indeed dying but has no intention of doing down in defeat just yet. With that she does something the shocks the three of them. She attempts to write something using the claw to try to save herself. As she writes Harlan becomes increasingly frustrated and takes a fishing hook and is about to impale Gwyneth with it when she is finally finished writing. In the end she wrote: \\"I, Gwyneth also known as Gwilanna live...\\" Part Five Gwyneth is boarded onto the Ark and placed into a casket. Despite having written something with the claw that should have brought her back to life her body remains lifeless. The Merriman family is reunited and they all gather around the casket along with Lefar and Bernard. It is then when Eliza reveals what she learned from Gwyneth, that Gwyneth is her mother. At that point Rosa walks in and is not pleased of seeing Gwyneth in the casket and demands that she be removed from the Ark. When she is told that Gwyneth may be still alive due to what she wrote on the boat with the claw before she died, Rosa proceeds to ensure her death by attempting to drive a wooden stake through her. David manages to stop her and Eliza explains that despite all the bad she has done she is still her mother and wishes for her body to stay on the Ark. Before leaving the area with Gwyneth's casket Harlan hands over the claw that he took from Gwyneth to David and tells David to meet him at the casket alone at some point to discuss a few things. Later on Rosa pulls David aside and has a private conversation with him. She claims that the Tapestry up on floor 108 is gone. It has somehow vanished when the Librarium was slowly transforming into the Ark of Co:pern:ica. Besides the loss of the Tapestry everything seems to be doing just fine in the Ark. Lefar starts helping Bernard satisfy his curiosity about the bees that colonised after the Ark came to be and everything seems to be doing just fine. Later on David goes to his meeting with Harlan. On his way he bumps into Angel who asks her to read her a part of the story Snigger and the nutbeast. He does so but before he can read more she gives him some sort of talisman ( possibly similar to the one that transforms into Groyne in the previous novels ) and then says she has to go. He thanks her for giving him the talisman and proceeds to meet with Harlan for their scheduled private meeting at Gwilanna's casket. It is also revealed ( if not know earlier in the novel ) that David and Rosa are the parents of Angel. She hatched from the egg in floor 108 guarded by the firebirds when they found it in the dead lands. It apparently fused with the chain of daisies that Rosa made for David before the time rift from Harlan's experiment and the tear that David shed when he saw the wounded Runcey. David arrives at the floor of the ark where his father Harlan is waiting for him. They take a moment to examine Gwyneth's body and to discuss the strangeness of her state. Harlan and David both agree it is strange that when Gwyneth wrote what she wrote on the ship that she is still in this condition. If the claw's purpose served true it would have brought Gwyneth back to life. They debate that this could possibly be because she might not have had her intent in check when she wrote so that's why it may not have worked. Then David proposes that due to the time nexus it has somehow delayed the effects. Later on after the scheduled meeting at Gwyneth's body at some point Harlan and David meet on the outside deck. At this point the large ship that is the Ark is setting coarse towards land. It is here when in great detail Harlan explains to David of the Battle in the Dead Lands between him, Bernard, Lefar and the rest of his tribe against the Re:movers. They were victorious as Harlan explains his story, however Abbot Hugo had to sacrifice himself when a Re:mover sunken in the marshes of the battlefield stuck its hand out in front of Harlan holding a bomb. Hugo protected Harlan by throwing himself onto the bomb to save Harlan's life. He also explained that he was burned in the eye by a scanner from one of the Re:movers which explains his eye wound. Angel then appears at Harlan's side. She tells Harlan that Hugo is very happy and cries, making his wounded eye heal. Rosa returns after riding Terafonne to some distant land. The Ark then stops at the Dead lands where all the animals inside are released. David and Rosa have a conversation with her afterwards primarily concerning the future of the Ark. David proposed that they should have the help of the firebird to distribute books to all the people of Co:pern:ica ( especially those uses boats to get close to the work of wonder ). Rosa refuses to simply give away all the books. However David explains it would not be so. Instead of keeping the books they would return them for a new one. Rosa then accepts and within days the firebirds are distributing books to numerous citizens of Co:pern:ica having many return with notes form those who borrowed them that requests new books. Many in their boats land them where the Ark itself also landed. They all then proceed to be shown to the Isle of Alavon. Lefar then declares that he shall be leaving soon and one by one he bids goodbye to the Merrimans and kisses Rosa's hand to bid her goodbye as well. However, when it came to David he asks him to stay. He then calls his father Harlan aside and reveals his secret that he has yet to tell him. He tells him that Lefar is in the tapestry in floor 108. Harlan, a little flustered from not being told of this earlier manages to get Lefar to stay. The distribution and return of books from the Ark continues. One day Rosa is busy cataloguing them when Lefar came in laughing. He claims that a note has been received for her that turns out to be a proposition of marriage to Rosa. Rosa turns him down because of David. Later on Str√∏mberg makes an entrance into the Ark. Once invited inside, Str√∏mberg states that everything seems to all well. At first he says that people thought that the Higher was angry and that the Ark was a symbol of their anger. However, later on the find out otherwise. That it is actually a gift from the Higher for people to understand and co-exist more with the wildlife brought by the Ark. Eventually everyone in the Ark gather around a table on the deck where David intends to discuss and explain more about things that circle around the Tapestry on floor 108. Since the Tapestry has still yet to be recovered, David uses his memory to imagineer a duplicate of the Tapestry to show to everyone. This scene is very important because if the reader was slightly confused before this is where all the pieces fall into place. While the grown-ups talk Eliza takes Penny for a walk so she wouldn't disturb the meeting. Once shown the replicate of the tapestry Lefar asks why they are in the Tapestry. Harlan being a scientist working for the Ragnar Institute explains the theory of time. He explains that present past and future are all united into one \\"now\\". That being said he explains that there are actually parallel dimensions out there with people who are the same as them but live different lifestyles in a completely different plane of existence. David then explains that the tapestry depicts a battle that he thinks was actually frozen in time. The dragon Gadzooks, who is also in tapestry with his pencil and pad, writes \\"sometimes\\" with his pencil and notepad. David says that Gadzooks basically froze the battle in a critical point when it apparently seemed to be swinging in the favour of the Ix. This explains why in the previous book everyone disappeared in battle near the end. After that he Gadzooks sending a distress beacon to other worlds for a request for help. The beacon apparently resonated with David in Co:pern:ica and the abnormal sleeping patterns David was having in the beginning of the book was really a response to the Ix tracking the beacon to Co:pern:ica and trying to get in via David. David also explains that there is a possibility that the Ix had a bigger ambition than to control the time nexus that they would use to unfreeze the battle. He explains that he believes that he is actually destined to go to the aid of those in the battle depicted in the tapestry and that is most likely why the Ix want him dead. Harlan then brings up an interesting point: Gwyneth actually wrote the name Gwilanna when writing herself back to life using the claw. The question is then raised of how Gwyneth would have known her name on the other world. They then figure out that the Ix actually gave her that information earlier while both were sharing information. As the conversation continues Rosa then shows up with two firebirds who have finally recovered the Tapestry. To the shock of everyone on the Ark the Tapestry is different then the one that David imagineered to replicate it. It is different in a sense that Gwyneth has apparently appeared on the Tapestry. Then there is a shocking revelation. When Gwyneth wrote \\"I, Gwyneth, also known as Gwilanna, live...\\" on the boat the reason she didn't come back to life is because she never intended to come back to life in Co:pern:ica. Instead when she wrote herself to life she ended up surrendering herself to the time nexus and realigns it in the process. She referred to herself by her other name Gwilanna when she was writing herself back to life using the claw. Since she referred to the name given to her parallel self on Earth, she was resurrected on Earth. If Gwyneth remained dead in the events of the Tapestry (which was the final battle in Dark Fire) the events of the Tapestry would be true. However this is not the case. Since she has brought herself back to life on Earth she has done so during the events of the Tapestry. David and Harlan reveal that this could completely change the events of the Tapestry if she were to be present while they occurred. Suddenly, Aurielle gets snagged in the Tapestry and as she starts to struggle to move she starts to pull at the thread on the Tapestry slowly unravelling it. This then causes the picture of Gwyneth (and a strange boy) to appear on the Tapestry and David to slowly move towards the Shadow of the Ix. At the very end of the book the water around the ark turns to fire. Human/Hybrid characters The Merrimans David Merriman The parallel world version of David Rain. At the beginning of the book he is a patient at the auma clinic because he is an ec:centric, which means he does not follow the great creation and can use his imagineering to imagineer things different from the great design. David later becomes the Curator of the Librarium after Mr Henry dies. David captures Gwyneth and speaks to her eventually and Gwyneth dies. Whilst coming back down, David finds the Isenfier tapestry has changed and Gwyneth/Gwilanna has survived and is on Scuffenbury hill, smiling. Eliza Merriman The parallel world version of Elizabeth Pennykettle. Early on in the book Eliza is chosen to become an Aunt by Gwyneth. She cracks her family anomaly and has the daughter without the help of an Aunt. After David leaves to return to the library she promises to keep reading Alicia in the Land of Wonder to Penny, stating that it will be less trouble and scary. She gets told by Gwyneth that Gwyneth is her mother and that she had all memories of her removed before reinstating her into the world. Eliza joins up with the family in the ark on the way to the Dead Lands. Penny Merriman The parallel world version of Lucy Pennykettle. Penny was born from an egg, much the same way the Pennykettle women are born in the other world. Penny is the same age as Lucy in the first few dragon chronicle books, but her Fain has not developed properly because of the time quake. Penny is inquisitive like Lucy and it is her who changes the Librarium into the ark. Harlan Merriman The parallel world version of Arthur Merriman. Harlan is a phy:sicist, working at the Ragnar Institute for Phy:sics. He is concerned for his son and to make sure his son has a normal life, experiments on temporal rifts unauthorised and is taken away to the Dead Lands. There he joins up with the Follows of Agawin and becomes friends with Matthew LeFarr. When they travel to the tower of Avalon Harlan gets given the Cr:eator, but loses it to the ix later in the book, where he learns they are targeting his son David. Harlan asks a member of the group who used to service the robotic Re:movers how to destroy and attack a Re:mover, and the reply is water. He manages to escape from the Dead Lands with LeFarr and rejoins his family upon the ark. Allies Rosanna ('Rosa') The parallel world version of Suzanna 'Zanna' Martindale. She is an orphan on this world, because her parents had supposedly \\"hidden her away\\" because her fain was limited and would stunt others from being able to flow. Rosa's parents volunteered to head for the Dead Lands. It is revealed that she has no fain. Rosa hates it when the Aunts move in and hatches a plan to remove the Librarium by torturing them. Angel The parallel world version of Alexa Martindale, found out when she calls David 'Daddy' Thorren Str√∏mberg The parallel world version of Anders Bergstrom. He again is a lot like his other world self although he does not appear to have the ability to be able to change himself into a bear. After the failed experiment, Stromberg knows that he will be wanted and will eventually be re:moved, goes into hiding. He shows up from time to time to help David, especially during the failed story telling and wants David to find the book of Agawin. Stromberg shows up on the ark and looks at the tapestry of Isenfier. Mr \\"Charles\\" Henry The parallel world version of Henry Bacon. Mr Henry is the curator of the Librarium. In this universe he is quite good tempered and does not mind young children. He helps out Rosa and David in the Librarium although even he did not know its full secrets. After the time quake, Rosa and David find him dead in his office and it is later shown that he died of natural causes instead of ageing. Bernard Brotherton The parallel world version of Brother Bernard. Before he is Re:moved from Co:pern:ica central Bernard was a tech:nichan working for Harlan. He helps out with the science experiment that goes wrong. Bernard is one of the few to escape the Dead Lands and hears Gwyneth's last words. Mathew Lefarr The parallel world version of Tam Farrell. He is described as being a natural leader. When he lived in Co:pern:ica central he worked with designing maps, and by asking too many questions in the wrong places, stumbled across things he should not have. LeFarr eventually breaks into a building controlled by the Aunts and this gets him removed to near the Isle of Avalon. When Harlan plans to destroy a Re:mover, Lefarr offers to be the bait as he knows the marshes the best and is the youngest and fittest of the group. After rejoining on the ark, Lefarr finds himself for Rosa and is going to leave the ark for the Dead Lands when David tells him to stay and LeFarr sees his parallel self in the tapestry. Aunts Aunt Gwyneth The parallel world version of Gwilanna. She is a lot like Gwilanna in the other parallel world, evil and always working toward the same goal, although she has a superior motive when she persuades Eliza to become an Aunt and is actually known as an Aunt Su:perior. She has many secrets and seems to know many things about Co:pern:ica that others do not. Gwyneth manages to catch the darkling that Harlan encounters and takes the Cr:eator off of it and agrees to commingle with it. Gwyneth dies after flying up to the top of the Librarium and falling after speaking to David. She tells Bernard some words, saying that she will live on. Nobody knows what this means, but David tells everyone not to worry. After finding the tapestry of Isenfier they find that the timeline has changed and that Gwyneth/Gwilanna is now on Scuffenbury hill waving goodbye to everyone. Aunt Agnes This is the Aunt that granted them to have David, and the Merrimans originally request her, but she is busy with another client. Aunt Primrose and Aunt Petunia They enter the book when Aunt Gwyneth commands them to stay at the Librarium to keep watch over Rosa when David leaves. They are strict, and they command Rosa to block up a window with books. When the books refuse, the two Aunts rips out their pages and stuff them in the gaps. They never let Rosa in their office, and when Rosa puts a drug in a mushroom dish to make them sleep, Rosa finds that they are draining the auma of books. Mystical Beings Gadzooks Gadzooks ('Zookie') is David's powerful writing dragon. His power is that he can write the future on his notepad. However, Gadzooks is only mentioned as a minor character, and does not use his powers. Eliza makes it for David out of clay, like when Liz makes it for David on Earth. In Fire World, Gadzooks (or Zookie) is made reading a book instead of a notepad and pencil, this could be a reference to the first book in the series when Liz Pennykettle tells David that she \\"tried him with a book, but he definitely wanted a pencil to chew on.\\" Boon The parallel world version of Bonnington. David created Boon purposefully flawed with part of one ear missing like Bonnington in the Pennykettle world. David teases him a lot when he returns home from the Librarium and Eliza often reprimands him. Terafonne Terrafonne is the parallel version of the mystical unicorn 'Teramelle' from Scuffenbury Hill in Dark Fire. Rosa is seen riding her around the Ark. Agawin A mystical winged creature who once lived on the Isle of Alavon. He is said to know everything about dragons and the tapestry of Insefier. He is briefly seen when Harlan Merriman and Mathew Lefarr find the Crea:tor in the abandoned tower. Fire Birds Fire Birds are very mysterious creatures, many Co:pern:icans have wanted to have one as a pet and they are generally regarded as a very high being/creature. They have a large eyrie up in the Librarium near the Isenfire tapestry. There are a few main Fire Birds e.g. Runcey which is Rosa's almost pet meaning he follows her and helps her out. However, the name 'Runcey' is just a nickname, the green firebirds real name is Aleron, the other two main firebirds are the red firebird Askiar and the cream firebird Aurielle who is the leader of the eyrie. Katts Katts are the other type of creature that inhabit Co:pern:ica and they are a lot like domestic Earth cats. There is one exception to their design and this is when David creates a flawed Katt named Boon. Gawain Harlan encounters Gawain when heading to The Isle of Avalon, but nobody in the tribe was able to see Gawain. Places Bushley Bushley is a town on Co:pern:ica, which is meant to be the parallel world version of Scrubbley, in the previous books. The book mentions it has a park, which Str√∏mberg and David go to. The Merrimans' house is: Pod 24, Crescent Way ‚Äì which is similar to the Pennykettles' house: 42, Wayward Crescent. The Dead Lands The Dead Lands are barren wastelands, outside of modern civilisation. Aunt Gwyneth sends Eliza there to 'train' to become an Aunt. Also, it is where Eliza discovers clay and shape an egg and many small dragons out of it. She is surprised when they come to life and when Penny hatches from the egg! The Dead Lands could be the parallel world of Farlowe Island. The Librarium The Librarium (also referred to as Bushley Librarium) is a huge building, with an uncountable number of floors, which we are led to believe is meant to be like the Great Alexandrian Library of Ancient Greece. It has millions of books housed inside, although not all of the ordered. The Librarium is a very strange place. To be able to move around people must use their fain to get to the right place. There are many places unexplored, past floor 42. It is later revealed that the Higher lives up on roof, inside the dome and can be entered through the dome into its sensory nexus. The Higher spawns all the auma for the entire Co:pern:ica, and the Aunts want to overthrow it, so that they can rule Co:pern:ica without having to abide to its rules. In the last part of the book, Penny takes a book from a shelf (Snigger and the Nutbeast), and this causes the librarium to change, as rain begins to fall outside. The Librarium is revealed to be an ark, and houses all of the animals of Co:pern:ica and are being taken to the Dead Lands.

The Bishop's Man is a novel by Canadian writer Linden MacIntyre, published in August 2009. The story follows a Catholic priest named Duncan MacAskill who became so successful at resolving potential church scandals quickly and quietly that he had to accept a position at a remote parish on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia to give himself a low profile. MacIntyre, a native of Cape Breton, released the novel amidst the ongoing sexual abuse scandal in Antigonish diocese in Nova Scotia. The book was awarded the 2009 Scotiabank Giller Prize and the Canadian Booksellers Association's Fiction Book of the Year. Critics gave positive reviews, especially noting MacIntyre's successful development of characters. Background The Bishop's Man was Linden MacIntyre second novel. His previous novel, The Long Stretch, which was published ten years earlier, in 1999. At the time of the new novel's publication author Linden MacIntyre was 66 years old and living in Toronto with his wife, and fellow journalist and author, Carol Off. MacIntyre was working at CBC Television where he had been the co-host of the fifth estate since 1990. Both The Long Stretch and The Bishop's Man were set on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia where MacIntyre lived as a child. As a child, MacIntyre was raised by an Irish-Catholic mother and attended church regularly where the local priest inspired him to consider entering the priesthood. Linden MacIntyre, 2008 The Bishop's Man was published at the same time as a $15 million settlement was reached in the sexual abuse scandal in Antigonish diocese in Nova Scotia. Evidence emerged that the principal offender, Bishop Raymond Lahey may have assumed the role of a bishop's man in sexual abuse scandal in St. John's archdiocese in Newfoundland in 1989 when he served under then-archbishop Alphonsus Liguori Penney. The Bishop's Man is one of the first cultural depictions of the Catholic sexual abuse emerging after the scandal. The term bishop's man has two possible meanings in an ecclesiastical context: it may refer to the title of vicar general who serves as the diocesan bishop's principal deputy for the exercise of administrative authority, or alternatively it may refer to the title of auxiliary bishop, a priest who is consecrated as an episcopal assistant to the local ordinary. In translating real-life situations to fiction MacIntyre stated, \\"I do believe that the very best of fiction is based on fact...and an awful lot of the factual situations I've been involved with just scream out for creative elaboration.\\" Plot The story follows the protagonist Duncan MacAskill, a priest and the dean of a Catholic university in Nova Scotia. In 1994, his bishop transfer MacAskill to the parish of Creignish and warns him that there are ongoing investigations and he wants MacAskill out of the way before people find him. MacAskill grew up near Creignish and begins to slowly adjust to life there where many people seem familiar to him. He befriends Danny MacKay, the son of an acquaintance of his, Danny Ban as well as Danny's maternal aunt Stella. Young Danny is a troubled young man who seems to have a complicated relationship with the church. The feelings between MacAskill and Stella and Danny's erratic behaviour towards the church cause MacAskill to reflect back on his career. In the 70s he witnessed Father Roddie MacVicar, a close friend of the bishop's, molesting a young boy and when he mentioned it to the bishop he was sent to Honduras where he fell in love with a local nurse, Jacinta. Upon his return MacAskill began to be used to cover for priests who had behaved improperly, whether they had impregnated their housekeepers or fallen in love with women to priests who had molested young boys. Part of MacAskill's job in these situations was to assuage angry parents, to tell them it was no use contacting the police, and that the church would punish the rapist, all the while knowing that they would simply be moved to a different parish instead. In the present, MacAskill continues attempting to reach out to Danny, suspecting that his predecessor, Brendan Bell, now married to a woman, had molested him. Danny continues to behave erratically, and after a fight in which he attempts to attack a local boy who ends up hitting MacAskill, Danny commits suicide. As a result, MacAskill drinks more heavily. In 1995 MacAskill is contacted by a reporter, MacLeod, about Danny's suicide. MacLeod believes there is a link between Danny and Bell but after MacAskill informs him that Bell is now married to a woman he drops the story. Shortly after though he re-contacts MacAskill to inform him that there was another suicide in British Columbia with affidavits saying that the man who killed himself had been molested by Father Roddie. MacAskill denies knowledge of this though he knows that Roddie was also implicated in the rape of a young girl with an intellectual disability as well. Though MacAskill gives MacLeod no information he begins to drink more heavily causing him to behave in improper ways which include kissing a former acquaintance and stealing liquor. His behaviour is eventually noted by the bishop who sends him to rehab near Toronto, a place where MacAskill knew he often sent other deviants. After rehab MacAskill tries to contact Bell again. He is eventually able to contact him through a name given to him by his niece who is a journalist. Back in Creignish Bell finally comes to talk to MacAskill. He tells MacAskill that he did know Danny quite well and the boy confided him and even implies that Danny was molested but is unable to provide him with more information than that, telling him to \\"look closer to home\\". Shortly afterwards, while MacAskill is out by the harbour, he comes across Willie Beaton, a local man, who drunkenly admits that he was the one who molested Danny. In anger MacAskill attacks Willie, pushing him so that he falls and injures himself on the rocks. He leaves the scene of the crime, returning to find that Willie has died. Though there is an investigation and a witness who saw MacAskill, MacAskill is let off as Willie's alcohol level was high and the witness was unsure whether MacAskill was moving to help Willie or not. As an act of contrition, MacAskill gives his journals, detailing the numerous cover-ups he participated in, to the police. He sends a letter of resignation to the bishop, who refuses to accepts it. Nevertheless, he decides to leave for a vacation, deciding to stay in Stella's place in the Dominican Republic. Before he goes, Stella admits that she and her sister knew about Danny being molested but decided not to tell his father, as his father would have murdered Willie. As he is leaving, MacAskill unexpectedly finds Danny Ban in the town's shopping mall. The two men embrace each other as they say their goodbyes.

It debuted on Maclean's bestsellers list in the August 28 issue at #8. In early October it was included on the shortlist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and it reached #5 on the bestseller list on October 15. It fell back to the #9 spot on November 5, but returned to #1 for several months after winning the 2009 Scotiabank Giller Prize. Note: The book remained at #1 until late-March 2010, except for the week of February 8 during which it was #2 on the besteller list. At its Libris Awards, the Canadian Booksellers Association awarded The Bishop's Man its Fiction Book of the Year and Linden MacIntyre its Author of the Year award. The book also won the Atlantic Independent Booksellers' Choice Award and the Dartmouth Book Award (Fiction) from the Atlantic Book Awards Society. In the Quill & Quire, Quebec writer Paul Gessell said that he found the characters to be \\"very credible\\" and \\"complex\\" but concluded that \\"at times, the plot is convoluted and the back-and-forth chronology gets rather tiresome. Generally, however, it is a well-crafted, brave, and painful examination of one of the most monstrous issues of our time.\\" The review in Publishers Weekly found the book to be an \\"engrossing, lyrical page-turner\\". Author Nicholas Pashley reviewed the book for the National Post, writing that \\"Some readers might find MacIntyre's frequent timeshifting a distraction, but by and large the author handles the various decades of his tale deftly. And as a native Cape Bretoner himself, he brings the region and its residents vividly to life.\\" In the Telegraph-Journal, Sylvie Fitzgerald writes that regarding the characterization \\"MacIntyre succeeds in demystifying the man beneath the medieval vestments, reminding us that a priest is a man first\\" and that \\"MacIntyre's work is resuscitated with colourful local colloquialism\\".

Haplogroup G1 is a primary subclade of haplogroup G. G1 is possibly believed to have originated in Iran. It has an extremely low frequency in modern populations, except (i) Iran and its western neighbors, and (ii) a region straddling south Central Siberia (Russia) and northern Kazakhstan. The most basal examples of G1 identified in living individuals, which belong to the G-L830 subclade, have been found across an area from the Arabian Peninsula (Northern Borders Region of Saudi Arabia, Ad-Dawhah of Qatar) to Belarus (Minsk Region) and China (Anhui).YFull YTree v8.07.00 accessed on August 30, 2020 Genetic features Almost all G1 persons have the value of 12 at short tandem repeat (STR) marker DYS392 and all will have the M285 SNP mutation which characterizes this group. This value of 12 is also uncommon in other haplogroups. The M designation for M285 indicates it was first identified at Stanford University. M285 has the following characteristics: The reference ID number is rs13447378.....Y position is 21151128....The forward primer sequence is and the reverse sequence ....The mutation is G to C. M285 was first reported in 2004 by Cinnioglu et al. So far all persons tested who have the M285 mutation also are positive the M342 SNP mutation. If someone should test differently, his results would become the basis of a new G1 category. M342 is located at sequence position 21653330 and is in the forward primer and in the reverse. It is a mutation from C to T. M342 was also identified at Stanford University, In addition, within haplogroup G, those G1 persons tested so far are uniquely positive (derived) for SNP L89 while all other G persons are negative (ancestral). The L89 SNP mutation has also been found in other haplogroups. L89 is located at sequence position 8038725, and the reference ID number is rs35160044. It is a mutation from T to C. The L89 designation was provided by Family Tree DNA. Dating of G1 origin While research studies have not yet dated the origin of G1's M285 SNP mutation, it seemingly represents one of the older G groups, arising perhaps halfway between the origin of G and the present day based on the number of STR marker mutations. Geographical distribution Geographical distribution While most research studies have failed to test for G1, likely or proven examples have been found in four groups (by geography and/or and/or secondary subclade): * Iran/Central Asia (including Russian Central Siberia, Kazakhstan and Pakistan); * the Middle East/South-East Europe (e.g. Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Dubai, Palestine, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen); * in very small numbers in South Asia (e.g. Nepal, India and Sri Lanka), and; * at very low frequencies in the rest of Europe.url=https://sites.google.com/site/haplogroupgproject/project-roster Haplogroup G Project samples The highest reported concentration of G1 and its subgroups in a single country is in Iran, with next most frequent concentrations in neighboring countries to the west. Specifically G1 was found in 5% of 177 samples from southern Iran in one study. The same study found G1 in 3% of 33 samples in northern Iran. The percentage in the south was almost equal to the percentage of G2, the only region in the world where G2 types were not found to be heavily dominant. Earlier studies which found about the same percentages of G in various parts of Iran failed to test specifically for G1. In Turkey, Cinnioglu found 1% of 523 samples of all types belonging to haplogroup G1 and like all available G1 outside Iran G1 was overshadowed by a much larger number of G2 men in the sample. All but one of the G1 samples in this study belonged to the further subgroup G1a, and all the samples were from northeastern Turkey. A study of Lebanon by Zalloua et al. failed to test for G1, but 26% of 38 G samples had the value of 12 for STR marker DYS392, almost always characteristic of G1. These G1 samples represent only 2% of the 587 total Lebanese samples and were well distributed among all religious groups there. A broader study of the Levant by El-Sibai et al. also failed to test for G1, but 12% of 17 Syrian G samples had the 12 value at DYS392. These G1 samples represent less than 1% of 354 Syrian samples. In the same study, 21% of 14 Jordanian G samples had the 12 value. These G1 samples represent 1% of 274 Jordanian samples. None of 8 Egyptian G samples had the 12 value. The likely G samples in the YHRD database url=http://www.yhrd.org/Search from the southern Caucasus area (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, Abazinia, Abkhazia) and from the northern Caucasus (North Ossetians, Kabardinians, Ingushians, Darginians, Lezginians, Rutulians and Chechnians) have only several 12-value DYS392 samples that might be G1. Sites with G1 concentrations The highest concentration of G1 within a distinct group within a country was reported among the Madjars of Kazakhstan where G1 persons comprised 87% of 45 samples, Argyn - 67%. G1 subgroups SNP-defined subgroups Subgroup G1a (P20) is rather common among G1 persons, but the reliability of SNP P20 in identifying G1a persons makes some tests for P20 a problem.http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GENEALOGY- DNA/2007-07/1185576938 Report of Thomas Krahn P20 results may be reported as P20.1, P20.2 and P20.3, and persons may have varying results for each. The technical features of P20 are: Y position is 25029911; 23396163.....forward primer is .....reverse primer is ...the mutation is a deletion of C. The mutation was identified at the University of Arizona and first reported by the Y Chromosome Consortium in 2002. Category G1a has a separate subgroup based on the presence of the value of 8 at short tandem repeat marker DYS494. With the exception of this G1a subgroup, all other G persons have 9 at this slowly mutating marker. So far about half of G1a persons who are otherwise ungrouped have this 8 value.Haplogroup G Project results url=https://sites.google.com/site/haplogroupgproject/nonstandard-markers G1a1 (L201, L202 and L203) were identified in a G1a person tested at Family Tree DNA in fall 2009, Subsequent testing showed that only some G1a persons have these mutations, and so far they are all from a closely related Ashkenazi Jewish cluster of men. The following Y positions were noted: 2718285 for L201, 13001714 for L202 and 13001715 for L203. In L201 the mutation is C to T; in L202 from T to C; and in L203 from A to G. If any man should have one of these SNP mutations without the others, this information would become the basis of a new G1a1 classification. Old G1b (P76) was removed from the official listing in August, 2012, because its discovery in a single person makes it so far only a private SNP. G1b (L830, L831, L832, L834, L835) were identified in late 2011 at Family Tree DNA. The G1c mutations are: L830 (T to C at position 6923908), L831 (T to C at position 6991562), L832 (T to G at position 12796626), L834 (T to A at position 16019950), L835 (G to A at position 16291409). STR marker value clusters There exist two distinctive European-ancestry Ashkenazi Jewish clusterings within G1a1 and G1c and a distinctive G1a Kazakh cluster‚Äîall three based on short tandem repeat (STR) marker values.url=https://sites.google.com/site/haplogroupgproject/project-roster Men in the Jewish G1c cluster have a value of 12 at STR marker DYS446 which is several values lower than almost all G persons, but the other two groups lack one specific marker value as an identifier. When approximately 30 or more STR markers are available when comparing samples, members in each of the three groups are easily ascertained. One of the distinctive European-ancestry G1c Ashkenazi Jewish STR marker value combinations is found also in an Iraqi Jew in one research study. See also page covering Jews with Haplogroup G (Y-DNA). Among available 67-marker G1 STR samples, the Ashkenazi G1a1 Jewish cluster represents the closest relatives to the Kazakh G1a cluster based on similarity of STR marker values. The Ashkenazi G1c cluster is only distantly related to the Ashkenazi G1a1 cluster, and the G1c Ashkenazi cluster has nearest relatives instead among diverse Europeans. Migrations of G1 persons The concentration of G1 found today in Iran and adjoining territory to its west suggests, but does not prove, this same area was the site of G1 origin. Due to the lengthy age of G1, distant migrations of small numbers of G1 persons could have occurred at any time during the historical period through a variety of types of population movements. It would be speculative to assume how the Ashkenazi G1 clusters or the Kazakh G1 clusters of men arrived in northeastern Europe and Kazakhstan respectively.

Although Bellevue Avenue is best known for the large number of Gilded Age mansions which line it, this block is a coherent collection of commercial buildings at the northern end of the mansion row. It is anchored around the Newport Casino, now the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and includes three other buildings on the east side of Bellevue Avenue between Memorial Boulevard and East Bowery Street.  History  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is completely contained within the National Historic Landmark District Bellevue Avenue Historic District. The first building on the block was the Travers Building, 170-184 Bellevue, which was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and built in 1870-71 for William Travers. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with applied half-timbering and topped by a mansard roof. It houses ten storefronts. The Newport Casino was built second, and its facilities occupy most of the block east of Bellevue Avenue. A National Historic Landmark, it was designed by McKim, Mead and White, and built in 1879-81. The King Block (204-214 Bellevue) was designed by Perkins and Betton of Boston, Massachusetts and built for Leroy King. It is faced on brown brick and houses six storefronts, and is situated just south of the Casino. The Audrain Building (220-230 Bellevue) completes the block; it was designed by Bruce Price of New York City and built in 1902-3 for Adolf Audrain. It is also divided into six storefronts, set off from each visually by arches.

The Imperial Daigaku-no-kami predates the Heian period; and the court position continued up through the early Meiji period. The title and position were conferred in the name of the Emperor of Japan. In the Edo period, the head of the educational and bureaucrat training system for the Tokugawa shogunate was also known by the honorific title Daigaku-no-kami, which effectively translates as \\"Head of the State University\\". The title and position were conferred in the name of the sh≈çgun. Imperial court hierarchy The Imperial court position of Daigaku-no-kami identified the chief education expert in the Imperial retinue. The Daigaku-no- kami was head of the Imperial University, the Daigaku-ry≈ç. The title arose during evolution of governmental reorganizations beginning in 701. These pre- Heian period innovations are collectively known as the . The position and the title ultimately came about under the direction of Prince Osakabe, Fujiwara no Fuhito and Awata no Mahito at the request of Emperor Monmu. Like many other developments at the time, the title was an adaptation derived from the governmental system of China's Tang dynasty. The somewhat inflexible hierarchical nature of the court requires that the function of the Daigaku-no- kami be understood both in terms of specific functions and in terms of those ranking above and below in the Ministry of Civil Services. In the Asuka period, the Nara period and the Heian period, the Imperial court hierarchy encompassed a ; also known as the \\"Ministry of Legislative Direction and Public Instruction\\".Ministry of Civil Administration, Sheffield.

The first reference to Engeldeo dates to 3 December 878, when he was already a comes (count), for on that date King Carloman granted land in the pagus of \\"Tonageuue\\" in Engeldeo's county to a priest named Iob. In 889 King Arnulf granted land at \\"Phuncina\\" (from Latin Pons Aeni, modern Innsbruck) in the pagus of the Nordgau in Engeldeo's county to a certain Gotahelm, Engeldeo's vassal. Under the year 895 the Annales Fuldenses record that \\"Engildieo marchensis Baioariorum\\" (Engeldeo, margrave of the Bavarians) was deprived of his benefices and removed from office, replaced by Liutpold. At the same time the annalist records that Hildegard, daughter of Louis the Younger, was accused of acting unfaithfully towards King Arnulf and deprived of her benefices (publicis honoribus). On 5 May that year Arnulf had had to intervene to return some land wrongfully taken from Megingoz, a vassal of Erkenbold, Bishop of Eichst√§tt, by Engeldeo and Hildegard. That these latter two were acting in concert at the same time as they were both deprived of public office in Bavaria suggests that they were allies against the interests of the king.

The term is commonly used in Australia, where it has been applied in various contexts, most recognizably in relation to special consideration policies for students and drought relief payments for farmers known as Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments or ECRP. It is similarly used in the law of the United States, particularly in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Australia Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments The Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payments or ECRP program was established in 1992 and has continued in various forms since. It provides financial assistance to farmers considered to be experiencing exceptional circumstances. Eligibility is generally determined by geographic location; specific areas are considered to be experiencing worse-than-normal drought conditions and, as such, farmers in those areas qualify for assistance. Farm- dependent small businesses may also be eligible for assistance. In February 2009, the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced that the payments would continue for an additional 12 months in 52 areas throughout Australia.ABC Rural News Exceptional Circumstances Interest Subsidy The Australian Government has also established a program to provide low-interest loans via private financial institutions which receive a subsidy from the Government.

The novel was completed while Rux was briefly in residence at the famed Chelsea Hotel in New York City. Plot Racine, an expatriate DJ returns from an ill-fated stay in Paris to a war-torn New York City and finds himself lodged in a deteriorating civil war era brownstone mansion in a Brooklyn neighborhood devastated by poverty and despair. Here he meets Manny, a crossdressing free spirit with a penchant for women and architectural history; Mawepi the stout bouncer and translator for the clairvoyant yet reclusive Holy Mother Lucinda; and Couchette, an emotionally scarred erotic dancer mired in denial regarding her famous jazz musician father's suicide. Immediately Racine finds himself creating the sonic backdrop for intense parties, orgies, and conversations while Manny and the other residents chase their dreams in a transitional New York. Couchette is the troubled spirit with whom Racine shares physically intimate and emotionally frustrating moments. The story weaves depictions of Racine's childhood, including his mother's death by fire when he was an infant; his experiences living with his brother, Frederick, in the custody of an uncle who is a disturbed religious zealot; Frederick's mysterious accidental death; Racine's eventual abandonment and years in foster care under the guardianship of a caring alcoholic; and the truth of his recent trip to France to visit a former schoolmate, Benoit, and his girlfriend. Rux infuses his tale with Greek mythology, mirroring Racine's tragic life experiences with that of Euripides' Hippolytus who is physically dismembered by a monstrous force on his journey to redemption. The characters in Asphalt all employ different strategies for abandoning experiences that have consumed and distorted their views of reality and their conflict with memory and poses a rhetorical embedded question in abandoned buildings and the psychological aftereffects of war-torn cities as to how cultures and individuals handle suffering, loss, and unresolved tragedy. Principal characters * Racine‚Äîthe protagonist DJ returned from life abroad in France to a war-torn New York City. * Couchette ‚Äîerotic dancer whose mother has absconded to Bali and whose jazz musician father killed himself in the very brownstone in which she now lives. * Manny‚Äîheterosexual transvestite drug dealer, a former student of architectural history; anti-imperialist radical and pyromaniac. * Benoit‚ÄîRacine's childhood friend; an aspiring filmmaker. * Nathalie‚ÄîBenoit's girlfriend. * Lucinda‚ÄîElderly Spanish speaking spiritualist, known by her sobriquet \\"Holy Mother Santa\\"; the landlord of a squatter's den. * Mawepi‚ÄîLucinda's guardian and translator.

Reviews L.A.WEEKLY \\"Asphalt, written largely before 9/11, is thick with images of and meditations on terror and terrorism, personal and cultural devastation, a post-apocalyptic New York, U.S. citizens living under a near police state, while citizenry of all races tote guns, real and metaphorical, whose bullets are anger and sadness. The music itself ‚Äî rap, trance, jazz, rock & roll, R&B;, techno, industrial ‚Äî is a major character in the novel, underscoring emotion and politics, allowing Rux to excavate the damaged inner lives of his characters while ruminating on how the world around them feeds their despair and dares them to rise above self and surroundings.\\" BLACK ISSUES BOOK REVIEW ‚ÄúThe first lines‚Ä¶ promise a m√©lange of literary forms and edgy melancholy characters. Part postmodern parable, part contemporary urban portrait‚Ä¶it is fully formed, like an existential poem.‚Äù EXAMINER \\"What makes Asphalt so interesting is that it showcases once artists amidst a post-apocalyptic culture that is firmly within the grips of a police state. The artists that (Racine) stays with are squatters living in a once-magnificent urban brownstone that has since decayed; people living in the French existentialist tradition. They can only get by, by having techno-inspired raves at night where they sell drugs and alcohol to all those who attend. All must contend with uncertain futures and a deep sense of loss, as though the world they once knew has crumbled all around them, and the only relief they can find is in each other and their commitment to whatever talents they have left. Rux's novel is written beautifully in a neo-1970s hipster style, and his writing is so effective because the attitudes, values, and mores that these artists abide by is subtly woven into his narrative and washes over us in undulating waves, constantly reminding the reader that art is indeed a state of being in many respects and not simply something that one does or is defined by the places or the conditions where one lives. Asphalt stands as a tribute to the resurgence that hit New York City's cultural hub just before the World Trade towers fell, and the result is a literary reminder of what many artists were once striving for when they first started out on their journeys, as the book takes the reader back to what had initially inspired them. But the tragedies of both poverty and exile forever remain capstones of that which once held so much promise. Even though Rux's portrait is one of decline and not of a resurgence, there's no question that there's a heroic struggle that these artists endure here that forever remains the same. The novel transcends both time and space.‚Äú PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY \\"The return of a club disc jockey to his Brooklyn roots (and a near- future, post-apocalyptic New York) sets the scene for this elegiac, moody set piece by playwright and musician Rux. Back from a stint in Paris, reticent Racine finds himself drawn to a dilapidated brownstone filled with eccentric squatters. Dying \\"Holy Mother\\" Lucinda and her doting caregiver, Mawepi, let him crash while Manny, a sequin-wearing druggie, and Couchette, a sexy exotic dancer, make him feel welcome. Racine gets busy \\"spinnin' \\" at Alibi, the illegal nightclub in the basement, and ends up romancing Couchette, whose mother has absconded to Bali and whose father killed himself in that very brownstone. Everyone is emotionally scarred, but the music they dance to and play (from U.K. trance to rock, blues to jazz) binds them together in a dizzying kaleidoscope of visions and images. The novel intersperses surrealistic segments about Racine's turbulent childhood (including a battle with orchitis as well as mental health problems) that may or may not contain the key to his current manic state. An enormous rave party is planned in an anchorage space, and as Racine, Manny, and Couchette arrive, a much-prophesied tragedy spells doom for the attendees. As a shocked Racine recounts his time producing music in Paris with childhood friend Phillipe, more confusion and disappointment settle over the narrative. Lyrically drawn though sometimes muddled escapist fare for the artsy set, this is an elegantly gloomy addition to Rux's artistic achievements. BOOKLIST \\"Racine, a young man of sparse words and hidden emotions, returns from Paris to an unnamed community in New York that has long been neglected but is now on the radar of developers. Racine is invited to join a group of squatters living in a decaying brownstone; they have created a family of sorts and cobbled together an enterprise--a bootleg party venue--that provides them with meager financial support. Racine is the gifted DJ with a deep sense of how music moves people. Bartender Couchette is a beautiful dancer whose jazz-musician father committed suicide. Manny, who dresses in sarongs but attracts women, is the overseer. Haunted by their pasts, these vulnerable characters live in an atmosphere of ominous despair, with the imminent threat of eviction and demolition and occasional patrols of police and M-16s, in a neighborhood disconnected from the more affluent parts of the city by a bridge raised as part of an urban warfare strategy. Rux's lyrical writing blurs the lines between Dreamscape and reality. A dazzling portrait of urban life.\\" References Category:Novels by Carl Hancock Rux Category:American speculative fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:2004 science fiction novels ","title":"Asphalt (novel)"},{"id":"25041714","text":"Jay M.

It is a dynamic version of the absolute purchasing power parity theory.Suranovic, International Finance Theory and Policy  Problems and Extensions of PPP Explanation Suppose that the currency of Country A is called the A$ (A-dollar) and the currency of country B is called the B$. The theory states that if the price P in country A of a basket of commodities and services is P A-dollars, then the price Q of the same basket in country B will be C√óP A-dollars, where C is a constant which does not vary over time, or, equivalently, C√óP√óS B-dollars, where S is the (variable) number of B-dollars required to buy one A-dollar, i.e. the exchange rate. If (1) and (2) denote two different dates, then it follows that :\\\\tfrac{1}{C} = \\\\tfrac{P(1)\\\\times S(1)}{Q(1)} = \\\\tfrac{P(2)\\\\times S(2)}{Q(2)} and hence :\\\\tfrac{S(2)}{S(1)} = \\\\frac{\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{Q(2)}{Q(1)}\\\\big)}{\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{P(2)}{P(1)}\\\\big)} or, in words, the factor representing the movement in market exchange rates is equal to the ratio of the inflation factors (changes in price levels) of the two countries (as one would intuitively expect). The function and the deduction of the function follow that :\\\\tfrac{\\\\Delta (P/Q)}{P/Q}= \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P(1)}{P(1)}-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta Q(1)}{Q(1)}=(\\\\frac{P(2)-P(1)}{P(1)})-(\\\\frac{Q(2)-Q(1)}{Q(1)})=\\\\pi(A)- \\\\pi(B) (Using logarithmic derivation) :\\\\text{S=P/Q} and hence :\\\\tfrac{\\\\Delta S(1)}{S(1)}=\\\\pi(A,1)- \\\\pi(B,1) The function above implies that the rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate equals the difference between the inflation rates of two countries. Absolute purchasing power parity occurs when C=1, and is a special case of the above. According to this theory, the change in the exchange rate is determined by price level changes in both countries. For example, if prices in the United States rise by 3% and prices in the European Union rise by 1% the purchasing power of the EUR should appreciate by approximately 2% compared to the purchasing power of the USD (equivalently the USD will depreciate by about 2%). Note that it is incorrect to do the calculation by subtracting these percentages ‚Äì one must use the above formula, giving \\\\tfrac{1.01}{1.03} = 0.98058, i.e. a 1.942% depreciation of the USD. With larger price rises, the difference between the incorrect and the correct formula becomes larger. Unlike absolute PPP, relative PPP predicts a relationship between changes in prices and changes in exchange rates, rather than a relationship between their levels. Remember that relative PPP is derived from absolute PPP. Hence, the latter always implies the former: if absolute PPP holds, this implies that relative PPP must hold also. But the converse need not be true: relative PPP does not necessarily imply absolute PPP (if relative PPP holds, absolute PPP can hold or fail). Absolute purchasing power parity Commonly called absolute purchasing power parity, this theory assumes that equilibrium in the exchange rate between two currencies will force their purchasing powers to be equal. This theory is likely to hold well for commodities which are easily transportable between the two countries (such as gold, assuming this is freely transferable) but is likely to be false for other goods and services which cannot easily be transported, because the transportation costs will distort the parity.

After two seasons as a prep school coach, he took his first collegiate coaching position as an assistant at Union College in 1978, where he was paid only $500 per year.http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2009/09/16/0916um_football.html In 1983, Lovett spent a season in the Ivy League at Brown University before moving back to New York to work under Joe Walton as the defensive quality control coach for the New York Jets of the National Football League in 1984. Maine and Cincinnati (Tim Murphy) The following season, Lovett was hired by Buddy Teevens as the defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach for the University of Maine Black Bears. In 1987, Tim Murphy took over as head coach and the team went on to win the conference championship and qualified for the Division I-AA playoffs. When Murphy was hired as the new head coach of Cincinnati in 1989, Lovett joined him as the defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bearcats. He stayed at the school until 1993, when he was hired as the secondary coach for the UNLV Rebels. In 1994, head coach Jack Cosgrove brought Lovett back to Maine to again serve as the school's defensive coordinator. Cosgrove had work alongside Lovett when he was offensive coordinator of the Black Bears before being named the head coach. Ole Miss and Auburn (Tuberville) In 1995, he joined new head coach Tommy Tuberville's staff at Ole Miss to coach the secondary. Four seasons later when Tuberville took the head coaching position at Auburn, Lovett followed him to the school, where he was named the defensive coordinator. Tuberville fired Lovett following the 2001 season. Clemson Lovett was hired by Tommy Bowden to serve as the defensive coordinator at Clemson from 2002‚Äì04, where he helped develop one of the ACC's top defenses. In 2004, Clemson was 11th in the nation in pass defense efficiency (103.4) and 26th in total defense (327.3 yds/g). In 2003, his defense allowed just 19.2 points per game as Clemson finished the year with nine wins and a top 25 national ranking. Bowling Green Lovett served as the defensive coordinator at Bowling Green from 2005‚Äì06. In addition to coordinating the defense at Bowling Green, Lovett coached linebackers in 2005 and defensive backs in 2006. In his first year with the Falcons, Lovett's defense ranked 20th in the country in turnover margin. North Carolina Lovett spent the 2007 and 2008 seasons as the special teams coordinator and a defensive assistant at North Carolina, where the kickoff coverage unit ranked among the nation's top 15 and the Tar Heels blocked six kicks in 2008. He coached the NCAA all-time leader in combined kick return yards in Brandon Tate, who also established the ACC career mark for kickoff return yards. Miami On February 12, 2009, Lovett was hired by coach Randy Shannon as the new defensive coordinator for the Miami Hurricanes. He served at the position for two seasons until being let go with the rest of the coaching staff following the firing of Randy Shannon at the end of the 2010 season. Texas Tech Lovett was hired by his former employer at Auburn, Tommy Tuberville, to serve as the Defensive backs coach for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Cincinnati Following head coach Tommy Tuberville's departure to Cincinnati, Lovett remained a member of the Texas Tech staff through the 2012 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas. Following the game, it was announced on January 4, 2013 that Lovett would be following Tuberville to Cincinnati to accept the defensive backs coach position. Philadelphia Eagles On February 8, 2013, Lovett was named the defensive backs coach for the Philadelphia Eagles. On January 19, 2015, it was announced that Lovett would move to a job in the Eagles pro personnel department. California Lovett was named the cornerbacks coach for the California Golden Bears football team on July 27, 2015. He was released in January 2017 following Sonny Dykes' dismissal as head coach.

Reyes earned a degree in law from the University of Chile in 1845. Throughout his political career, Reyes remained allied with Manuel Montt and Antonio Varas, whose supporters formally established the National Party in 1857. In 1849, Reyes was named an alternate member of the Chamber of Deputies from Caupolic√°n, but never took office. He began working for the Santiago municipal government in 1851. Reyes won his first parliamentary election the next year, taking a seat in the Chamber of Deputies as a representative of Los √Ångeles and Yungay. He was reelected in 1855 from San Fernando and again in 1858, from Melipilla and La Victoria, a district of Santiago. As a legislator, Reyes served on the industry, treasury, and war committees. Upon his return from exile in Europe in 1862, Reyes became a diplomat and helped reach treaties with Ecuador and Costa Rica. Later, Reyes aided in the drafting of the legal codes regulating commerce, civil actions, and criminal activity. He was Minister of Finance between 1864 and 1869. From 1868 to 1870, Reyes served as concurrently as interior and foreign minister. Reyes also returned to the Chamber of Deputies, representing Itata between 1863 and 1867. After his term ended, Reyes became a judge on the Santiago Appeals Court. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Chile in 1870, and concurrently took office as a senator from Curic√≥. Reyes stepped down from the Senate in 1882, and relinquished his judgeship in 1883, before dying in Santiago on 8 January 1884.

It is an immediate descendant of G2a (G-P15), which is a primary branch of haplogroup G2 (P287). G2a1 has an extremely low frequency in almost all populations except parts of the Caucasus Mountains. In 2017, the SNP L293 was replaced by FGC7535, SK1106 and Z6552 as the defining SNPs of G2a1, due to the technical difficulty in testing for L293. Genetic features of haplogroup G2a1 Almost all G2a1 persons have a value of 10 at short tandem repeat (STR) marker DYS392. The major G2a1 subgroup typically has higher values for DYS385b, such as 16, 17 or 18, than seen in most G persons. Almost all G2a1a persons have a value of 15 or more at DYS385a, a finding which can be helpful in distinguishing G2a1a persons from non-G persons with similar marker values. In addition, the G2a1a persons tested were found to have a value of 9 at marker DYS505. This is several values below what is found in G subgroups, and is potentially the basis of additional subgrouping. L293 which defines G2a1 is a SNP first identified at Family Tree DNA in 2011, and in 2012 was determined to encompass P16 positive persons. L293 is found at chromosome position 10595022 and represents a mutation from G to C. The forward primer is , and the reverse primer is . Under usual circumstances subgroup G2a1a persons would also have the distinctive mutation at SNP P16 that characterizes G2a1a. The reliability of P16 in identifying everyone who should be P16+ has been questioned. Because there are two strands involved, P16 results can be reported as P16.1 and P16.2, and persons may have varying results for components of the SNP. The P designation in P16 indicates it was identified at the University of Arizona, and P16's existence was first reported in 2000. These are the specifications listed for P16: located on the Y chromosome at 19434578; 19128376.....forward primer is .....reverse primer is ...the mutation is a change from A to T. Dating of G2a1 origin The only published study to date P16 (G2a1a) argues it is about 9,600 years old. This dating methodology is not universally accepted. G2a1 subgroups G2a1a (P16) and G2a1a1 (P18) The presence of the SNP P16 mutation characterizes G2a1's only SNP subgroup, G2a1a. But it is difficult to distinguish P16 from its own P18 subgroup. The reliability of P16 in identifying everyone in its G2a1a category has been questioned. As to P18, because individual strands are examined, P18 can be classified as P18.1, P18.2 and P18.3, and persons may have varying results for three components. The P designation indicates it was identified at the University of Arizona, and its existence was first reported in 2002. The technical specifications for P18 are that it is: located on the Y chromosome at 25751219; 25029753; 23396005....forward primer is ....reverse primer is .....the mutation is a change from C to T. Other G2a1a genetic clusters Due to the unreliability of the SNP testing for this haplogroup, it can be difficult to validate whether identificable clusters of men belong to G2a1a or instead to G2a1a1. The most common cluster based on STR marker values of G2a1a men who report ancestry in the Caucasus Mountains region has the value of 9 at STR marker DYS391 and 19,21 at marker YCA. Significant other smaller G2a1a Caucasus clusters with 10 or 11 at DYS391 also exist. The Ashkenazi Jewish G2a1a men with northeastern European origins almost all have YCA values of 21,21 and a DYS19 value of 16. More variation in values is seen in the Caucasus samples than the Ashkenazi samples, suggesting an older common ancestor in the Caucasus than among the Jews. Other G2a1a men reporting eastern European ancestry form a cluster with YCA values of 19,21 without the other distinctive values seen in the other two clusters. About half of the available G2a1a/G2a1a1 samples do not reliably belong to any of these three clusters. In addition, the STR markers mentioned are prone to further mutations and are not as reliable as SNPs in identifying all the persons who share a common male ancestor. Finally, there are lesser numbers of G2a1 men who are negative for P16. It is unclear whether their ancestors may have ever had the P16 mutation. Many of these men have a very unusual 13,21 value for marker YCA and are predominantly Hispanic. Geographic distribution G2a1a and its one subgroup represent the majority of haplogroup G samples in some parts of the Caucasus Mountains area. G2a1a is found only in tiny numbers elsewhere. A recent article by Balanovsky et al. provided the first detailed testing of P16 and P18 in this region. Almost all P16 samples also had the P18 mutation. The highest percentage of P18 was found among Ossetians of Russia's Republic of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, representing 32% of all samples there. Among Abkhazians of Abkhazia, P18 was 16% of total samples, and it was 8% of Circassians (Adyghe) in Russia's Republic of Karachay‚ÄìCherkess. Elsewhere in the Caucasus, P16 and P18 were negligible or represented a small percentage. The southeastern Caucasus area was not sampled. There are isolated samples of G2a1a men with reported ancestry in Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, western Russia, Libya, and England with similarities to those of a North Ossetian cluster based on STR marker values. The Svans and South Ossetians within Georgia have significant G2a1a presence though no one has yet quantified the percentage. Likewise closely related to a Jewish cluster based on STR marker values is an anonymous sample in the SMGF database from Kashgar, China,http://www.smgf.org/pages/ydatabase.jspx as well as isolated samples from Lebanon, Cyprus, Armenia and the Austrian Tyrol. The mostly eastern European YCA=19,21 subgroup includes an anonymous sample in the SMGF database from Kyrgyzstan, and another sample from among the Svans of Georgia exists. There are also isolated samples that do not belong to any cluster from the major countries of central, eastern and southern Europe, from Morocco, the northern Middle East, the Caucasus region and Iran. The sample from Iran (Tehran) represents only 1 of the 444 Iranian samples of all types in the YHRD database. Possibly of significance‚Äîunlike some other G subgroups‚ÄîG2a1 samples from southern Asia do not seem to exist.https://sites.google.com/site/haplogroupgproject/project-roster Haplogroup G Project Samples - G2a1/G2a1a In contrast, among the Romani of Hungary many of the available haplogroup G samples have STR marker features typical of G2a1a. Geographical origins of haplogroup G2a1 The exceptionally high level of G2a1a in the North Ossetians has attracted attention and speculation. Since the Ossetians make claim to descent from the Alans, a group of Sarmatians, it was thought that the Alans or their predessor residents of the area north of the Caucasus. The type of haplogroup G in these European areas, however, is not G2a1a which is rare in Europe. If the Ossetian G2a1a originated in the major groups north of the Caucasus sometime during an approximate 2,000-year period, it would have been sequentially either from the Scythians, the Alans (and other Saramatians) or the Huns. All three groups were described north of the Caucasus in different time periods as they migrated from the east. Examination of ancient DNA from Scythian skeletons from the steppes to the east of the Caucasus has found only haplogroup R1a. The Sarmatians subsumed the Scythians. Then many of the Sarmatians migrated westward into Europe. Then the Huns occupied the area north of the Caucasus prior to their own migration farther westward involving large numbers of men. Finally, the Mongols in their migration into the area north of the Caucasus forced what are thought to be the ancestors of modern Ossetians southward down to the edge of the mountains. These three groups that occupied the area to the north of the Caucasus had language and cultural similarities. But they were also considered just confederations of various tribes. Sarmatians in particular were known readily to accept other groups into their numbers.Bachrach, Bernard S., A History of the Alans in the West. Univ of Minn. Press, 1973, p.18 Because all three groups were also nomadic and often relocating in mass migrations, it is conceivable they vacated the last residence leaving little genetic trace of their occupation within the next occupants. Only the Scythians were mentioned in historical records as having a connection south of the Caucasus where significant concentrations of haplogroup G exist. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus related that the Scythians had carried Medes to the River Don north of the Caucasus presumably from today's northwestern Iran, this event giving rise to their name Sauromatians.l Scythians had occupied Media 653-625 BCE. Pliny also suggested Sarmatians descended from Medes.Pliny, Natural History, VI, ch 7, W. H. Jones, transl., Wm. Heinemann, London, 1949-54 But historians have difficulty explaining how the Sarmatians instead seemed to come from central Asia off to the east in their occupation of Scythian lands around the 5th century BCE. The Median lands were primarily in northwestern Iran, and the G samples found there do not resemble the types or patterns seen in the Caucasus. In the Nasidze study of Y-DNA in various Caucasus groups, he concluded that the groups north of the Caucasus are closer genetically to each other than to persons south of the Caucasus. But he used only brief STR marker samples, and more samples and more detailed ones are now available. These latter samples indicate the G2a1a found in the North Ossetians is most frequently found also south of the Caucasus and rarely elsewhere. If a concentration of G2a1a points to the location of its origin, the north and south Caucasus region would be the likely location of origin. However, the first ancestors who were G2a1a could have been small in number, and a relocation from elsewhere is possible. The most important factor in determining G2a1a origins is knowing from where the North Ossetians came. Because of the confederation nature of the Alans, it is possible the Ossetian ancestors were part of those Alans who did not participate in the Great Migration. But it also seems plausible that the pre- Alan ancestors of the North Ossetians arrived there from south of the Caucasus where G is found in significant numbers and with the diversity seen in a longtime presence. The G in the area to the north of the Caucasus lacks both features. Two studies published in 2011 and one in 2012 argued that persons of the Caucasus had their origin in lands to the south. Famous members Joseph Stalin, from genetic testing of his grandson (his son Vasily's son; Alexander Burdonsky) belongs to haplogroup G2a1a1. The STR marker value combinations for him are typical of those seen primarily in the Caucasus region. Richard III of England was confirmed just prior to his re-interment to be a member of haplogroup G2, despite the low frequency of this haplogroup in modern Great Britain.

De Vitr√© was the surgeon of his ship. In December 1600, a French trading company was formed through the association of Saint-Malo, Laval and Vitr√©, to trade with the Moluccas and Japan.

Martin and another Frenchman, Fran√ßois Pyrard, were among the first Frenchmen to visit India. They went to Surat and also visited the town of Gujarat. In his Memoires, Martin wrote that the world was learning from China at that time. On his return, King Henry IV directed Martin to write an account of his travels. They were published in 1604. His account created a strong enthusiasm for commerce with Asia, and from 1604 to 1609, Henry IV attempted to set up a French East India Company on the model of England and the Netherlands. In 1609, a Malay language dictionary was added to Martin's work, possibly the work of Pierre- Olivier Malherbe, also from Vitr√©, who was just returning from a 27-year world tour and has a claim to being the first French circumnavigator.

Tony Tanner (27 July 1932 ‚Äì 8 September 2020) was a British stage, film and television actor and a Tony-nominated theatre director and choreographer. Career Training and early career Tanner graduated from the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art with the Douglas Cup, awarded him by Margaret Rutherford. He spent five years in northern repertory companies, playing everything from Saint Peter to the front end of a cow in a British pantomime. Acting career Intimate revues in West End of London brought Tanner some notoriety, including an appearance in a sketch by then-unknown Harold Pinter. Later Tanner played the patsy in The Birthday Party, opposite Pinter himself, by this time known to everybody. Tanner made numerous appearances in plays and on variety shows on British television, including a stint as Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream, opposite Benny Hill‚Äôs Bottom. All of this culminated in the role of Littlechap in Stop the World - I Want to Get Off in London‚Äôs West End, taking over for author Anthony Newley. He played the same role in Warner Brothers' film version of the show. Tanner went to America to assume the lead role in Half a Sixpence on Broadway, and remained in the U.S. Two more starring roles on Broadway followed: in No Sex Please, We're British opposite Maureen O'Sullivan, and Sherlock Holmes guest starring with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Tanner played Iago to Robert Guillaume‚Äôs Othello at the National Sylvan Theater. He had many appearances with top opera companies in the comic roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Tanner's original one-man show Charlatan, portraying the Ballets Russes founder Sergei Diaghilev, was the hit of the New York International Fringe Festival, and went on to the York Theatre Royal and London's King's Head Theatre in 2010. Directing career As a director, Tanner has staged and choreographed five shows on Broadway ‚Äî including Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, for which he received Best Director and Best Choreographer Tony Award nominations. His 1981 production of A Taste of Honey starring Amanda Plummer was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Revival in the same season. Tanner directed a number of Off-Broadway plays as well.

A man who has had similar abnormal discharge from his genitals is known as a zav. In the realm of tumah and taharah, the zavah has the ability to create a midras, (, , ) and to make unclean for a seven-day period - a man who conducts sexual intercourse with her. Additionally, the zavah and her partner are liable to kareth for willfully engaging in forbidden sexual intercourse.  Hebrew Bible  Torah sources for the zavah are sourced in the book of Leviticus (, ). According to textual scholars, the regulations concerning childbirth,() which have a similar seven-day waiting period before washing, and the sin and whole offerings, were originally suffixed to those concerning menstruation, but were later moved.Jewish Encyclopedia, Leviticus Although the zavah regulations clearly have a sanitary benefit in the light of modern medical knowledge, Biblical scholars see these regulations as having originally derived from taboos against contact with blood and semen, because they were considered to house life and were consequently considered sacred;Peake's commentary on the Bible the seven-day period is thought to exist to ensure that the abnormality has genuinely ceased, the sin offering is considered to have originally been made as an apology for violating the taboo.Jewish Encyclopedia, Sin Offering  In rabbinic literature  According to the Jerusalem Talmud, the eleven-day period between each [monthly] menstrual cycle is Halakha LeMoshe MiSinai.Jerusalem Talmud (Berakhoth 37a [5:1]) This has been explained by MaimonidesMaimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil. Issurei Bi'ah 6:1‚Äì5) to mean that seven days are given to all women during their regular monthly menstrual cycle, known as the days of the menstruate (Hebrew: niddah), even if her actual period lasted only 3 to 5 days. From the eighth day after the beginning of her period (the terminus post quem, or the earliest date in which they begin to reckon the case of a zavah), when she should have normally concluded her period, these are days that are known in Hebrew as the days of a running issue (Hebrew: zivah), and which simply defines a time (from the 8th to the 18th day, for a total of eleven days) that, if the woman had an irregular flow of blood for three consecutive days during this time, she becomes a zavah and is capable of defiling whatever she touches, and especially whatever object she happens to be standing upon, lying upon or sitting upon.  Zavah ketanah  The woman, within an eleven-day window of the completion of her base seven-day niddah period (and her typical immersion in the mikveh) notices an abnormal blood discharge. This one time discharge deems her a zavah ketanah (minor zavah) and brings the requirement for her to verify that the next day will show no discharge. Provided the next day is clean, her immersion in the mikveh prior to sunset makes her tahor (pure) after sunset.  Zavah gedolah  In the zavah gedolah (major zavah) scenario, the woman, within an eleven- day window of the completion of her base seven-day niddah period (and immersion in the mikveh) notices an abnormal blood discharge.This one time discharge deems her a zavah ztanah (minor zavah) and brings the requirement for her to verify that the next day will show no discharge If the next day another discharge is noticed, followed by yet another discharge on the third consecutive day, she is deemed a zavah gedolah. She is then required to count seven clean days, immerse in a mikveh on the seventh day and bring a korban on the eighth.

The zavah is commonly known as one of four types of tumah that are required to bring a sacrifice post the purification process.Rashi on Makkoth 8b The korban consists of both a sin offering and a whole offering, each involving a dove.  Viewed as Divine punishment  Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno reasons that the zavah gedolah state is a divine consequence to alert the woman from acting in a manner comparative to Chava (Eve). This unpleasant consequence is implied by God's message to Chava in the verse \\"I will increase and multiply your discomfort\\" (Genesis 3:16), with the seven-day waiting period intended to allow a spirit of repentance and purity to enter her will. Her bringing of a dual sacrifice, the Chatat and Olah, are to rectify her negative action and thought, respectively.Sforno to Vayikra 15:19 Targum Yonathan describes the zavah state as a divine consequence to a woman who neglects the requirement to take adequate precautions involving the laws and nuances of menstrual impurity.Targum Jonathan on Ecclesiastes 10:18  In modern Judaism  Due to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Judaism regards the sacrificial regulations as being in abeyance; rabbinical tradition subsequently differentiated less between the regulations of zavah and those for niddah. In Orthodox Judaism nowadays, zavah (an abnormal discharge) and niddah (healthy menstruation) are no longer distinguished. A menstruating woman (niddah) is required to wait the seven additional clean days that she would if she were a zavah. Conversely, Reform Judaism regards such regulations as anachronistic; adherents of Conservative Judaism take a view somewhere between these views, with opinions in favor of returning to the Biblical distinction between niddah (ending seven days from the beginning of a normal menstrual period) and zavah (ending seven days after the end of an abnormal discharge).

It involves the allocation of one customer's payment to another customer's account to make the books balance, often to hide a shortfall or theft. Teeming & lading is a method by which a person who takes or handles payments uses the money personally for some days and posts the transaction later. The handler receives cash, and uses it for personal purposes instead of depositing it. A common practice trait in this fraudulent activity is that the amounts received from the subsequent debtor is credited to the earlier debtor's account so that one debtor's account does not show an outstanding balance for a long time. To make up the shortfall, when another payment comes in, the handler will deposit that money against first money used, and does not show the new amount received until later. Such a process is continued until the time the original amount misappropriated is finally replaced or until the cashier is caught. Another similar strategy is applied when remittances are received by means of cheques, where cheques are split up to record payments. This is known as splitting cheques. By encashing the cheques, less amount is credited to the debtor and rest of the amount is misappropriated. Auditors look during the vouching process as part of the verification of transaction to identify teeming and lading.

While playing for the University of Michigan, he was selected as a first-team All-Western tackle three consecutive years from 1904 to 1906 and as an All-American in 1904 and 1905. In his four seasons as the starting left tackle for the Michigan Wolverines, the team compiled a record of 37‚Äì2‚Äì1, won two national championships and outscored opponents by a combined total of 1,699 to 60. Curtis later served as the head football coach at Tulane University from 1907 to 1908 and at the Colorado School of Mines in 1909. Football player A native of Pueblo, Colorado, Curtis played three years of high school football in Colorado. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1903 to play football for Fielding H. Yost's famous \\"Point-a-Minute\\" football teams. He played tackle for the Michigan Wolverines from 1903 to 1906. 1903 season As a freshman in 1903, Curtis was selected by Yost to play on the varsity football team. He started all twelve games at left tackle for the Michigan team that finished the season with a record of 11‚Äì0‚Äì1, outscored opponents 565‚Äì6, and has been retrospectively declared National Champions. 1904 season In 1904, Curtis started all ten games at left tackle for the Michigan football team that compiled a 10‚Äì0 record, outscored opponents 567‚Äì22, and has been retrospectively declared national champions. At the end of the 1904 season, Curtis was selected as a first-team All-Western tackle by the Chicago Daily News, Chicago Journal, Chicago Post and Chicago News. The Chicago Tribune also selected Curtis for its 1904 All-Western team and noted: \\"Curtis of Michigan has been the star tackle of the year. Weighing 230 pounds, strong, active, he has outplayed every opponent. Seldom has he been 'boxed in' by end of tackle plays, and in getting down the field under punts he has often preceded his ends. On the offense he has developed into one of the best ground gainers on Yost's eleven, and has been most effective in disposing of his opponents when his team has had possession of the ball.\\" Although Eastern football writer Walter Camp picked Curtis as a second-team All-American in 1904, at least one All-American selector also chose Curtis as a first-team All-American. In announcing the selection, that writer said: \\"Hogan of Yale is the best tackle of the year. Next to him is Curtis of Michigan, a wonder on defense and almost as strong in tearing up interference as the blue captain. There can be little doubt of the ability of this pair to make the real 'All-America.'\\" 1905 season Curtis was considered one of the best defensive players in the West, but he was also a leading ball-carrier and kicker for Michigan on offense. In 1905, he started all 13 games at left tackle and was one of the leading scorers for a team that compiled a record of 12‚Äì1 and outscored its opponents 495‚Äì0 in the first 12 games before losing to the Chicago 2‚Äì0 on Thanksgiving Day. Curtis's individual scoring totals in 1905 included the following: *In a 44‚Äì0 win over Kalamazoo College, Curtis scored three touchdowns. *In a 36‚Äì0 win over Case, Curtis scored two touchdowns and kicked a \\"goal from touchdown.\\" *In a 23‚Äì0 win over Ohio Northern, Curtis scored two touchdowns and three goals from touchdown. *In an 18‚Äì0 win over Vanderbilt, Curtis scored a touchdown and \\"did yeoman service in advancing the ball, by both hurdling and straight smashing.\\" *In a 31‚Äì0 win over Nebraska, Curtis scored a touchdown. *In a 70‚Äì0 win over Albion College, Curtis scored a touchdown and ten goals from touchdown. *In a 48‚Äì0 win over Drake, Curtis scored seven goals from touchdown. *In a 40‚Äì0 win over Ohio State, Curtis scored a touchdown and a goal from touchdown. *In a 75‚Äì0 win over Oberlin College, Curtis scored four touchdowns and two goals from touchdown.The Michigan Alumnus, Dec. 1905 In the season's final game at Chicago, Curtis was disqualified early in the game on grounds of unnecessary roughness. Early in the game, Chicago quarterback Walter Eckersall, considered the best player in the West, dropped back for a punt from Chicago's 40-yard line, and Curtis broke through and threw Eckersall to the frozen ground as he tried to block the kick. Eckersall lay on the ground knocked out for two minutes following the blow. The referee ruled that Curtis had swung an upper cut at Eckersall's jaw and ruled Curtis out of the game. A newspaper account of the incident reported that, after Eckersall had gotten the punt safely away, Curtis, who had broken through, \\"came down on the little maroon like a whirlwind, knocking him down.\\" Without Curtis in the lineup, Michigan lost its first game since 1900, losing to Chicago by a score of 2 to 0. After the game, Yost observed, \\"Michigan's chances were materially lessened when Curtis went out.\\" The ruling ejecting Curtis from the Chicago game became a source of controversy. Eckersall himself spoke in defense of Curtis: > \\"I will never believe that Curtis intended to rough it with me in that > unfortunate incident in the Michigan game. He was doing his best to block > the punt, but could not stop in time to keep from running me down. I have > known Curtis for several years, and he is a gentleman and one of the best > sportsmen I have ever met. I feel that he has been unjustly censured for the > play in which I was injured and for which he was ruled out of the game.\\" Two weeks after the Chicago game, the Michigan football players unanimously elected Curtis as captain of the 1906 football team. The players noted that Curtis was given the honor both due to his ability as a player and \\"the desire of the team to evidence their belief that the ruling out of Curtis from the Chicago game on Thanksgiving day for alleged unnecessary roughness in play was entirely unjustified.\\" The selection of Curtis was reported to be \\"peculiarly pleasing to Ann Arbor's students ... because they think that his disqualification in the Chicago match was a great injustice and mistake.\\" After the 1905 season, Walter Camp named Curtis as a second-team All-American for the second consecutive year. In selecting Curtis, Camp noted: > \\"Curtis, of Michigan, mentioned in these columns last year, is a type of man > the east has not seen, but he would be something of a revelation. He is > heavier than any of the standard eastern tackles, but so quick on his feet > ... Curtis is also good on defense. ... He is a good plunger and works well > with a heavy back field.\\" 1906 season In 1906, Yost undertook what was referred to in the press as a \\"startling shift\\" in moving Curtis to the left end position. One sports writer referred to Curtis as a \\"mastodon,\\" and noted that, although he \\"carries something like an eighth of a ton of beef and brawn whenever he moves,\\" he also had \\"the speed of a quarter horse.\\" Under the rules of the day, the five middle linemen were not permitted to drop back of the line scrimmage unless they were at least five yards behind the line when the ball was put in play. By placing Curtis at end, Yost explained that he would give Curtis the ability to play on the line or back off without having to be a full five feet behind the line. In this way, Curtis could be used both to receive the ball and open holes. In the first four games of the 1906 football season, Curtis started two games at left end and two games at left tackle. Michigan won those four games by a combined score of 72 to 13. The fifth and final game of the short 1906 season pitted Michigan against Pennsylvania. One week before the Penn game, Curtis suffered a badly broken leg during a practice game. He had been running with the ball when he was tackled by a member of the scrub team, and \\"his leg was heard to snap.\\" Due to the seriousness of the injury, Curtis was hospitalized for several weeks and did not play in the Penn game. In Curtis's four years at Michigan, the football team lost only two games ‚Äî the 1905 Chicago game from which Curtis was ejected for unnecessary roughness and the 1906 Penn game in which Curtis could not play due to his broken leg. Based on the games played before the injury, Curtis was selected as a first- team All-Western player in 1906 by the Chicago Tribune, Inter-Ocean, and Chicago Chronicle. After four years starting at the tackle position for Michigan, Curtis had \\"earned a reputation as the greatest tackle that ever played football in the west.\\" Curtis graduated from the University of Michigan as part of the engineering school's Class of 1907. Football coach Tulane After graduating from Michigan, Curtis served as the head football coach at Tulane in 1907 and 1908. Shortly after being hired at Tulane, Curtis proposed an international football game with Tulane playing against the University of Havana in Havana, Cuba. Some called it a stunt. After consecutive winless seasons in 1905 and 1906, Curtis coached Tulane to a 3‚Äì2 record in 1907. In 1908, he led the Tulane team to a 7‚Äì1 season ‚Äî the best record in the school's history to that time ‚Äî including wins over the Texas Longhorns, the Ole Miss Rebels, Centre College Praying Colonels, Washington Bears and the Baylor Bears. In 1909, Curtis retired as Tulane's coach and announced plans to enter business in his home state of Colorado. School of Mines In September 1909, Curtis was hired to serve as the head football coach for the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. In November 1909, a Colorado Springs newspaper reported that Curtis had injected \\"more ginger\\" into the school's playbook and had \\"planned a number of new and spectacular formations.\\" At the end of the 1909 season, Curtis resigned as football coach at the School of Mines, declining an offer to make him a member of the faculty and director of athletics will full charge of the gymnasium and all athletic programs. Curtis announced that his sole reason for declining the offer was his desire to go into business. After retiring from coaching, Curtis lived in Denver and was called upon to referee important inter-collegiate football games.

The Dakhlet Nouadhibou Region, one of the primary administrative divisions of Mauritania, is named after it.  Geography  It is one of the largest natural ports on the Atlantic coast of Africa and the only one in Mauritania. It is limited by the Cap Blanc (also known as Ras Nouadhibou ) headland on its western side. The bay opens towards the south and contains numerous shoals and extends from north to south for about 50 km, creating a bay about 43 km long and 32 km wide at the widest point. In French maps the inner bay is known as Baie de l'Archim√®de and the wider bay as Baie du L√©vrier. In addition to its geographical conditions, the bay of Nouadhibou has very favourable maritime conditions, given the absence of significant currents. The weather conditions also favour its use as a port as it is sheltered from winds and storms. The only unfavourable factor is the shallow sea depth in most of the bay, which has required frequent drainage of the navigation channels.alt=  Economical importance  The bay of Nouadhibou is the most important economic and commercial area of Mauritania. It is the base of the Mauritanian fishing industry, as well as the route by which the iron ore from the mines of Zou√©rat is exported from the country. The iron ore arrives at the ore terminal of Point Central (located 10 kilometers south of Nouadhibou) by a railway which runs 650 km from the mines to the port.

O Maria, Deu maire (\\"O Mary, mother of God\\") is an Old Occitan song, a hymn to the Virgin Mary, unique in being both the only song from the Saint Martial school (the chantry of the Abbey of Saint Martial at Limoges) that is entirely in the vernacular (having no Latin stanza or refrain) and the only medieval Occitan song with extant musical notation for all its (twelve) stanzas.For the importance of the work, and a new English translation, see William D. Paden and Frances F. Paden, edd., Troubadour Poems from the South of France (D. S. Brewer, 2007), 3 and 18‚Äì19. It dates to the 1090s and is preserved in MS f. lat. 1139 of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.A photograph of folio 49r can be seen in John Haines, Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouv√®res: The Changing Identity of Medieval Music (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 17.

A liturgical song, O Maria was designed to communicate sacred truth to the people in a language they could understand, although usually this was done through a mixture of Latin and vernacular verses. The melody of the piece basically repeats for each stanza with only minor variations. The later songs of the troubadours, composed in the same style, were never transcribed with more than one stanza of music. It has been suggested that, like O Maria, subsequent stanzas were melodically similar with only minor variations. Similarities have been drawn between the music of O Maria and that of a ninth-century hymn to the Virgin, Ave maris stella (\\"Hail, star of the sea\\"),An edition of this poem with translation can be found in Frederick Brittain, ed., The Penguin Book of Latin Verse (Penguin, 1962), 129. and also between O Maria and Reis glorios, verais lums e clardatz (\\"Glorious King, true light and brilliance\\"), an alba by the troubadour Guiraut de Bornelh (fl.c.1200).

In the early nineteenth century, the resemblance of his Londe of Java to Australia was noted. Charles Ernest Coquebert de Montbret, having been able to examine the Rotz atlas at the British Museum during a visit to London following the Peace of Amiens in 1802, claimed in a lecture to the Soci√©t√© Philomathique de Paris in 1803 that its Londe of Java was evidence of a discovery of the east coast of Australia by Portuguese based in the Moluccas, who perhaps were accompanied by French seafarers who thereby found the opportunity to obtain the intelligence upon which the map, and others of the Dieppe school, was prepared. His claim was refuted by Fr√©d√©ric Metz in a letter to the Revue Philosophique, Litt√©raire et Politique of 11 Novembre 1805. Metz noted the absence of New Guinea and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and pointed out that a chart that recorded the voyage of navigators who had gone as far as the southern extremity of the east coast of Australia could not have failed to indicate the breadth of sea that separated Australia from Java, whereas the Rotz map showed only a narrow channel between the two. The Italian traveler Ludovico di Varthema visited Java in 1506 and said it ‚Äúprope in inmensum patet (extends almost beyond measure)‚Äù. Rotz apparently identified this ‚ÄúJava patalis‚Äù with the Regio Patalis, a huge promontory of the Terra Australis, depicted on the 1531 world map of the royal cosmographer, Oronce Fine. Robert J.

It is a branch of haplogroup G (Y-DNA) (M201). In descending order, G-P303 is additionally a branch of G2 (P287), G2a (P15), G2a2, G2a2b, G2a2b2, and finally G2a2b2a. This haplogroup represents the majority of haplogroup G men in most areas of Europe west of Russia and the Black Sea. To the east, G-P303 is found among G persons across the Middle East, Iran, the southern Caucasus area, China, and India. G-P303 exhibits its highest diversity in the Levant. Genetic features All G-P303 men carry the P303 or S135 SNP Y-DNA mutation. There are also some short tandem repeat (STR) findings among G-P303 men which help in subgrouping them. Many of the men have an unusual value of 13 for marker DYS388, and some have 9 at DYS568. STR marker oddities are often different in each G-P303 subgroup, and characteristic marker values can vary by subgroup. Often the values of STR markers DYS391, DYS392 and DYS393, however, are respectively 10, 11 and 14 or some slight variation on these for all G-P303 men. P303 first became available for public testing in fall 2008, and the P designation indicates it was identified at the University of Arizona. The mutation is found on the Y chromosome at position 20104736. The forward primer is TTCTTATTTGCTTTGAAACTCAG. The reverse primer is ATTGGCTTATCAGATTGACG. The mutation involves replacement of T by C.http://ymap.ftdna.com/cgi- bin/gbrowse_details/hs_chrY?name=P303;Sequence;ref=ChrY;start=20104736;end=20104736;feature_id=41027 This mutation was actually first identified as S135 at Ethnoancestry in London, England, but it took some time to realize that P303, which was independently identified, and S135 were the same. Dating of G-P303 origin Yfull dates TMRCA of all P303 in their database to 11,000 BP, and TMRCA with sibling PF3359 to 14,000.https://yfull.com/tree/G-P303/ Yfull datings tend to be regarded as a quarter too young. Old World geographical distribution In Europe, G-P303 definable subgroups make up a majority of Haplogroup G persons west of Russia and the Black Sea, and small numbers are also found in North Africa. The Baltic countries have the lowest population percentage of G-P303. Scandinavia is similar, showing less than half the percentages of G persons seen in the countries to the south. G-P303 seems to represent the same percentage of the population in both central and southern Europe, and usually represents half or more of the G seen in the population in these areas. To the east, G-P303 samples are found in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt), in the Middle East (Israel (found among Jews, Arabs, and Druze), Lebanon, Iran (reaching its highest at about 15% of Khuzestan Arabs), Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Dubai), the Caucasus Mountains area (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kabardinians, Abazinia, Uzbekistan, and scattered among ethnic groups of northwestern China and Russian Siberia. A distinctive Indian type of G-P303 exists, but its prevalence is unclear. An isolated G-P303 sample from Malaysia exists. Concentrations of G-P303 at certain sites The highest percentage of G-P303 persons in a discrete population so far described, 86%, is in the Tuapsinsky District, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, among Shapsugs. In Western Europe, one of the highest percentages is on the island of Ibiza off the eastern Spanish coast. All of the available G samples from Ibiza are typical G-P303 samples based on STR marker values. In total, about 16% of its population is likely G-P303 on the same basis. These samples include many identifiable persons from the DYS388=13 subgroup, and are also commonly seen in Sephardic Jewish samples. Haplogroup G (P303) in Ibiza is likely representative of the significant population of Crypto-Jews who came there fleeing the Spanish Expulsion and Inquisition.http://www.jcpa.org/jl/hit12.htm Survivors of the Spanish Exile-- The Underground Jews of Ibiza--Gloria Mound The percentage of haplogroup G among available samples from Wales is overwhelmingly G-P303. Such a high percentage is not found in nearby England, Scotland or Ireland. G-P303+* The asterisk indicates negativity for G-P303's only subgroup. This category was established in April, 2010 because of the determination then, that persons with the L140 SNP mutation comprise a separate subgroup of G-P303. G-M278, G-Z6885, G-Z30503 and G-L140 are the known subgroups G-L140 Persons in this category have the L140 SNP mutation. L140 was identified at Family Tree DNA in 2009, but the determination that not all G-P303 person have this mutation was not made until April, 2010. This mutation is located at chromosome position 7630859, and is a deletion.http://ymap.ftdna.com/cgi- bin/gbrowse_details/hs_chrY?name=L140;Sequence;ref=ChrY;start=7630859;end=7630859;feature_id=40508 The bulk of L140+ men belong to L140 subgroups. =G-U1 and its subgroups= U1 was first identified at the University of Central Florida in 2006 but it was not described in a publication until 2009. The listed technical specifications are:....location rs9785956.....forward primer is TTTCTGCTCCAAATCTGCTG....reverse primer is CACCTGTAATCGGGAGGCTA....the mutation involves a change from A to G. A high percentage of all tested European U1+ persons so far are positive for the subgroup in which the L13 or S13 SNP mutation is present. In contrast the bulk of the non-Europeans (mostly in the western Caucasus Mountains) belong to the L1266 subgroup of U1.  G-L13/S13  Almost all L13+ persons of European ancestry have the value of 12 or 13 at STR marker DYS385a and values of 19,20 at STR marker YCA. There are a few L13+ samples available which lack these mutations, and a shared common ancestor farther back in time from the others can be presumed for these samples. The L13/S13 SNP was first identified at the University of Central Florida in 2006 as the U13 SNP, but prior to the publication of the details of this research in 2009, the SNP was also independently identified in 2008 at Family Tree DNA in Houston, Texas, as L13 and at Ethnoancestry in England as S13 and made available for public testing. The technical specifications are given as.....Y chromosome location rs9786706.....forward primer is GTGGTAACAGCTCCTGGTGAG.....reverse primer is TGCTGCTTTGGTTAACTGTCC...the mutation involves a change from C to T. The L13 subgroup is most common in north central Europe and is found in almost all places in Europe where other types of G are seen, but this subgroup seems uncommon in almost all countries outside Europe. Outside Europe L13 is seen most commonly in the Near East. The Haplogroup G Project has indicated among its large G collection that likely or proven G-L13 STR samples comprise the following percentages of available G samples in the following European countries [in descending order]: Germany, 16%.....Italy, 11%.....Netherlands, 10%.....France, 10%.....Poland, 9%.....Spain, 9%.....Ireland, 6%.....England, 5%.....Switzerland, 4% A small, overwhelmingly English, subgroup of L13/S13 exists and is designated as L1263. This was first identified at Family Tree DNA in summer, 2012, and represents a mutation from G to A at chromosome position 8111187.  G-L1266  The L1266 mutation was first identified at Family Tree DNA in July, 2012. Early indications are that it encompasses a high percentage of U1 men who do not belong to U1's L13 subgroup. The L1266 mutation is found at position 15412419 on the chromosome and represents a mutation from A to G. Some L1266 men also belong to a L1266 subgroup consisting of men with the L1264, L1265 and L1268 mutations. These were identified at the same time as L1266 at Family Tree DNA. L1264 is at position 7704368, mutation A to G; L1265 at position 12741229, mutation A to G; and L1268 at position 20081319, T to C. =G-L497 subgroups= The largest subgroup in Europe based on available samples is with men having the L497 mutation. This SNP was first identified in January, 2011, in testing at 23andMe and made available for separate testing at L497 by Family Tree DNA. The chromosome locations are given as 15932714 and rs35141399, and the mutation is from C to T. The forward primer is ATGAGTGGCCTCACCAAGGGAATC and reverse primer is ATGGGCAACAGGTGTCCTGAAG. A high percentage of men with L497 have the value of 13 at STR marker DYS388. This is a rare mutation from the ancestral value of 12. A very small number of men within this DYS388=13 subgroup seem to have mutated yet again to 12 or 14. The geographical distribution of this 13 mutation and other features were first described in a research journal in 2007. Percentages of DYS388=13 men within G samples are particularly high in northwestern Europe. Some DYS388=13 subgroups below are based on SNP mutations and others on STR marker value oddities. Most L497 men belong to its subgroup Z725. The Haplogroup G Project has indicated among its large G collection that likely or proven STR samples from the DYS388=13 type, comprise the following percentages of available G samples in the following countries [in descending order]: Switzerland, 74%.....Spain, 60%.....France, 58%....Germany, 57%.....England, 54%....Ireland, 48%.....Netherlands, 45%.....Italy, 43%....Poland, 29%....India, 0% The Polish percentage of DYS388=13 men is diminished solely because of the origins of a significant group of G2c men in that country. Without the G2c group, the DYS388=13 percentage is 50%. The German G samples are much more numerous in the southwestern part of the country. Based on marker values, the only non- European DYS388=13 sample that has surfaced from the Old World that has similar STR marker values to the Europeans is a single sample from Egypt. And the only SNP-proven L497+ men outside Europe in the Haplogroup G Project have Turkish ancestry. The paucity of proven samples from outside Europe so far leaves open the possibility this DYS388 mutation originated in a European. = G-Z725 = Z725 was first identified by a citizen researcher among data for a single sample in the 1000 Genomes Project in summer 2011, but it was not until summer 2012 that it was confirmed in testing at Family Tree DNA as a separate subgroup. This L497 subgroup is the most common G subgroup in Europe because a high percentage of L497 men are also Z725+. Z725 is found at chromosome position 7957070 and is a deletion. = G-L43+/S147+, L42-/S146- = This subgroup is rare because virtually all tested L43+/S147+ persons so far are also L42+/S146+. The SNP was first identified in a listing of SNP results from testing at 23andMe. It was independently developed as a separate test by both Family Tree DNA as L43 and by Ethnoancestry as S147. In fall 2009 a test again at 23andMe provided information for the first time that a person who had the L43 mutation simultaneously lacked the L42 mutation that typically occurs with L43. This anomaly was verified by testing the same person at Family Tree DNA. So L43+/S147+ is now a separate category. The technical specifications for L43 are as follows: Y chromosome location 16446759....forward primer is GAGGTTTTCGGAGCTTACCTATAC....reverse primer is CACTGCTTGTAGATAGTAAAGTTTG.....the mutation involves change from A to G.http://ymap.ftdna.com/cgi- bin/gbrowse_details/hs_chrY?name=L43;Sequence;ref=ChrY;start=16446759;end=16446759;feature_id=40931 = G-L43+/S147+, L42+/S146+ = About a fourth of DYS388=13 men have this L42/S146 mutation. Swiss men are more likely than average to belong to this subgroup. L42/S146 could be nearly as old as the DYS388=13 mutation based on the number of value differences seen in 67-marker STR samples. The SNP was first identified in a listing of SNP results from testing at 23andMe. It was independently developed as a separate test by both Family Tree DNA as L42 and by Ethnoancestry as S146. The technical specifications for this SNP are as follows:....position on Y chromosome is 15170153.....forward primer is CTCACAATAGGCAGCATCCCCTCAG.....reverse primer is CAGAAAAAGGGAGCATATGACCAAGG.....the mutation involves a change from C to A.http://ymap.ftdna.com/cgi- bin/gbrowse_details/hs_chrY?name=L42;Sequence;ref=ChrY;start=15170153;end=15170153;feature_id=40874 = DYS391=7 = This multi-value (multistep) mutation at STR marker DYS391 to the value of 7 from the original 10 is found in a group of Hispanic men. = DYS464a=9 = This multi-value (multistep) mutation at STR marker DYS464a to the value of 9 is found so far only in Swiss and German men. = DYS388=15 = This small subgroup is composed of men whose ancestor mutated two values at STR marker DYS388 to 15. Members of this subgroup must have other marker values similar to persons in the overall DYS388=13 subgroup. So far only persons of English ancestry belong to this DYS388=15 subgroup. Marker DYS388 rarely mutates, and a two-step (two-value) mutation is almost as valuable as a SNP mutation in identifying persons within this distinctive subgroup. = DYS393=12 with genetic nearness = This small subgroup is composed of men whose ancestor mutated at STR marker DYS393 to 12. This marker value is unusually low for G persons. The persons with this finding seem to report ancestral origins primarily in Cyprus based on current knowledge. = DYS594=12 with genetic nearness = While a mutation to a value of 12 from 10 or 11 is seen primarily in this group, there exist a few DYS594=12 men who do not belong to the group. The men in this group form a distinctive cluster of persons with closely related STR marker values in addition to the DYS594 oddity. This DYS594=12 subgroup has an unusually high percentage of Welsh surnames with the rest mostly of English ancestry based on available samples. G-Z1903 subgroup Z1903 men so far all have the value of 9 at STR marker DYS568 and less reliably 20,21 at marker YCA together with a close relationship based on STR marker values. The reason DYS568=9 can be used as a generally reliable categorization value is due to the fact this represents a multi-step mutation in a very slowly mutating marker. Although not the subject of a research study, the age of the mutation to 9 at DYS568 may have been about 3,000 yrs. ago based on the number of marker value differences of 67-marker STR samples. And the mutation to 20,21 at YCA would have arisen in this same general time period. Persons within the DYS568=9 group who were tested for the marker GATA-A10 had values one or more higher than found in other haplogroup G subgroups. Those from the Ashkenazi cluster had the highest values of 14. Additional results would be needed to determine if these findings are consistent within the DYS568=9 group. Almost all Z1903+ men have the additional Z724 mutation. Men who are Z1903+ and Z724- comprise only a small group within Z1903 and so far are only Hispanic men. Z1903 and Z724 were identified in 2011 in two samples in the 1000 Genomes Project, one from Utah in the United States and other from Beijing, China. Z1903 is found at chromosome position 15106340 and represents a mutation from A to G. Z724 is found at position 6895545 and represents a mutation from C to T The Z-series SNPs were identified by volunteer researchers. No Z1903 persons have so far been located in the Middle East or Anatolia region where haplogroup G can be unusually common. Several samples, however, have been found among Ossetians in the central Caucasus Mountains and in a sample from Beijing China. Though found all over Europe, Z1903 men are so far missing from Scandinavian samples north of Denmark. This Z1903/Z724 subgroup contains a further large subgroup consisting of Ashkenazi Jews who are relatively closely related based on STR marker values and typically have a value of 16 for marker DYS385b. The Jewish cluster does not seem to share a common ancestor with the non-Jewish men within the Current Era. And the common ancestor of the Ashkenazi Z1903 men likely lived in the Middle Ages based on the small number of STR marker value difference seen among them. See also page covering Jews with Haplogroup G (Y-DNA). There is another, smaller subgroup of Z1903 persons who have the value of 9 at STR marker DYS439. The ancestral value for this marker is 12 within the DYS568=9 group, and this 9 represents a rare multi-step mutation. This DYS439=9 subgroup is predominantly German, and the mutation is probably over 2,000 years old based on number of marker value differences in 67-marker STR samples. The Haplogroup G Project has indicated among its large G collection that likely or proven DYS568=9 samples comprise the following percentages of available G samples in the following countries [in descending order]: Ireland, 12%.....England, 9%.....Netherlands, 5%.....Poland, 5%.....Italy, 4%.....Germany, 3%.....Spain, 3%.....France, 2% Within the Z724 subgroup is a subgroup of G-L640+. This is a small group of men presently all from the British Isles. This SNP was identified in summer 2011 at Family Tree DNA. It represents a mutation from A to G and is found at position 16903082 on the Y chromosome. Most, if not all, these L640+ men also have the value of 8 at marker DY533 which is otherwise rare among Z724 men. G-L660+, L662+ This subgroup is a small one, and so far found only in Europeans. Both SNPs involved were first identified at Family Tree DNA in summer 2011. L660 is found at position 12511525 on the Y chromosome and is a change from C to A. L662 is found at position 16446702 and is a change from C to T. G-L694+ Persons in this subgroup have the L694 mutation which was discovered at Family Tree DNA in summer 2011. So far, this mutation has been found primarily in Polish men. It is located at position 5734987 on the Y chromosome and is an insertion mutation.

It tells the story of seven young girls, including a 21-year-old Navajo woman, Crystal Frazier, who decide to compete in a beauty pageant for the title of Miss Navajo for 2005‚Äì2006.  Summary  In the beginning of the film, Frazier believes it will be impossible to her to win the competition. However, she becomes more serious about her participation in the contest when she realizes that the pageant isn't about stereotypical beauty standards, catering to superficial American values or making money, but about being a hardworking Navajo woman who wants to respectfully represent the culture and serve as a role model and spokesperson while preserving the language and tradition of the Navajo people. Spanning five days, the Miss Navajo pageant consists of several competition categories that test contestants on their Navajo knowledge and skills. The requirements to enter the Miss Navajo pageant are the contestants must be over eighteen years old, be a high school graduate, answer various questions about Navajo government, history, and current issues, perform a modern-day and traditional skill or talent, speak the Navajo language, and participate in the sheep butchering and bread making. Although Frazier does not win the competition, being Miss Navajo was about meeting other people and experiencing a role that encompasses responsibility, courage, and leadership.

Described as an amateur geologist, he is nevertheless recognized for his work in the then-nascent field of ichnology. His work grew from study of Cambro-Ordovician rocks near his birthplace, leading to the description of new genera and species of ichnofossils. His early interest in geology may have been inspired by local access to the Abraham Gesner geological collection. Matthew was the first curator of the Natural History Society of New Brunswick. After Canada's Confederation in 1867, his geological work came to prominence as the Geological Survey of Canada began, and he worked part-time for the survey.

Since its founding in 1956, Outward Bound Australia has made outdoor education courses available to the community with the aim of developing teamwork skills and raising environmental awareness Australia wide. Outward Bound's focus on personal and leadership development through outdoor adventure activities has made it popular amongst a diverse array of groups and individuals within the community, over 250,000 Australians aged between 13 and 75 have completed a course. Notably, OBA maintains a number of longstanding relationships with partner schools such as the Cranbrook School in Sydney which has made OBA courses a mandatory part of their school curriculum. History Outward Bound Camp Bivouac in D'Entrecasteaux National Park OBA's outdoor education courses are based on the principles adopted by German educator Kurt Hahn to train young British seamen to survive in the North Atlantic Ocean during the Second World War. The first course in Australia was held in 1956, three years later another course was conducted at Fisherman's Point, on the Hawkesbury River. Warwick Deacock, the first Director of the Outward Bound School, adopted the location as Outward Bound's homebase in Australia until 1973. Presently, OBA operates from Namadgi National Park in the south western region of the Australian Capital Territory but also conducts courses in the Snowy River National Park (Victoria), Walpole-Nornalup National Park and D'Entrecasteaux National Park (Western Australia), Kosciuszko National Park and Toonumbar National Park (NSW) ranging from 7‚Äì26 days in length on offer 12 months a year. As part of the OBA Manifesto (which details the idea of reaching the community as a whole), scholarship opportunities are available for applicants who demonstrate financial, demographic or socio-economic disadvantage. Evaluation of long- term program impacts Outward Bound engaged heavily in research throughout the 1980s and 1990s to design an evaluation procedure that would accurately measure the impact their courses have on participants. Work conducted by James Neill and Garry Richards, especially the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire (LEQ), is a leading tool for the Australian outdoor industry but as of late has to gain widespread popularity worldwide. LEQ aims to measure the impact of a program on student self-perception from the beginning to the end of the experienced based learning program with particular regards to: human capital, self-efficacy, motivation, community participation, and community support. In 2002 Outward Bound began to deliver its annual Aspiring Leaders program in to measure responses from the communities it had engaged with. Based on LEQ, participants reported a major change in achievement motivation and task leadership. Corporate programs Australian companies, such as Boral, use Outward Bound courses as a team building activity for staff and in order to develop leadership skills for those moving into management positions. The Country Fire Authority has incorporated Outward Bound courses into their annual training calendar for adult and youth volunteer firefighters for 14 years, using the outdoor wilderness based program to enhance team performance in preparation for natural disasters such as the Black Saturday bushfires that engulfed Victoria in early 2009. In a show of support, the Outward Bound alumni program orchestrated the cleanup of a property owned by a Community Relief Centre volunteer worker who lost her home in the fires. Canberra's Super 14 Rugby team, the Brumbies, participated in an Outward Bound camp and a three-day mountain bike ride to Mount Kosciuszko in 2009 after Stephen Hoiles took over as team captain from Stirling Mortlock earlier in the year, and Andy Friend succeeded Laurie Fisher as head coach in late 2008. Public programs With the support of community organisations such as the Lions Clubs and The Smith Family, OBA offer several programs to the general public including one aimed at young adults (Navigator Program), a more physically adventurous course (Pinnacle Program) and a lengthy 26-day adventure course (Summit to Sea) which takes participants from Tharwa in Australia's Capital Territory, to Mount Kosciuszko finally ending up on Victoria's southern coast along the Snowy River. Schools programs Outward Bound School Group in Walpole- Nornalup National ParkOutward Bound High Ropes Course Public, Catholic and Independent schools across Australia use Outward Bound programs to support curricula. School programs range from a twelve-member group program (such as the one devised for Total Education in Warwick) to sequential full year groups of four hundred plus students that schools such as The Cranbrook School in Sydney conduct annually.

It was named Le Chat Noir and was centered on political events and satire. It later inspired creation of Kabarett venues in Germany from 1901, with the creation of Berlin's √úberbrettl venue and in Austria with the creation of the Jung-Wiener Theater zum lieben Augustin housed in the Theater an der Wien. By the Weimar era in the mid-1920s it was characterized by political satire and gallows humor. It shared the characteristic atmosphere of intimacy with the French cabaret from which it was imported, but the gallows humor was a distinct German aspect. Difference from other forms Kabarett is the German word for the French word cabaret but has two different meanings. The first meaning is the same as in English, describing a form of entertainment featuring comedy, song, dance, and theatre (often the word \\"cabaret\\" is used in German for this as well to distinguish this form). The latter describes a kind of political satire. Unlike comedians who make fun of all kind of things, Kabarett artists () pride themselves as dedicated almost completely to political and social topics of more serious nature which they criticize using techniques like cynicism, sarcasm and irony.(1997) The new encyclopaedia Britannica, Volume 2, p.702 quote: History √úberbrettl The first Kabarett venue was the Le Chat Noir in France, founded in 1880 by Rodolphe Salis. It later inspired similar venues in Germany and Austria such as the \\"√úberbrettl\\", the first Kabarett venue (Berlin, 1901) in Germany and the \\"Jung-Wiener Theater zum lieben Augustin\\" in Vienna. Ernst von Wolzogen founded in Berlin the first German cabaret called √úberbrettl (literally Superstage, a play of words on Friedrich Nietzsche's √úbermensch, Superman), later known as Buntes Theater (colourful theatre), in January 1901. In the foundation of the √úberbrettl , von Wolzogen was inspired by Otto Julius Bierbaum's 1897 novel Stilpe. In Munich, the Die Elf Scharfrichter was co- founded by Otto Falckenberg and others, in April 1901. It is sometimes considered the first political kabarett. Kabarett ROhrSTOCK All forms of public criticism were banned by a censor on theatres in the German Empire, however. This was lifted at the end of the First World War, allowing the kabarett artists to deal with social themes and political developments of the time. This meant that German kabarett really began to blossom in the 1920s and 1930s, bringing forth all kinds of new cabaret artists, such as Werner Finck at the Katakombe, Karl Valentin (died 1948) at the Wien-M√ºnchen, Fritz Gr√ºnbaum and Karl Farkas at the Kabarett Simpl in Vienna, and Claire Waldoff. Some of their texts were written by great literary figures such as Kurt Tucholsky, Erich K√§stner, and Klaus Mann. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933, they started to repress this intellectual criticism of the times. Kabarett in Germany was hit badly. (Kander and Ebb's Broadway musical, Cabaret, based on the Christopher Isherwood novel, Goodbye to Berlin, deals with this period.) In 1935 Werner Finck was briefly imprisoned and sent to a concentration camp; at the end of that year Kurt Tucholsky committed suicide; and nearly all German-speaking kabarett artists fled into exile in Switzerland, France, Scandinavia, or the United States. When the war ended, the occupying powers ensured that the kabarett portrayed the horrors of the Nazi regime. Soon, various kabarett shows were also dealing with the government, the Cold War and the Wirtschaftswunder: Cabaret Ulenspiegel in Berlin, the university cabaret Tol(l)leranten in Mainz,Hans Dieter H√ºsch biography h√ºsch.org Retrieved January 24, 2012 the Kom(m)√∂dchen in D√ºsseldorf and the M√ºnchner Lach- und Schie√ügesellschaft in Munich. These were followed in the 1950s by television cabaret. In the GDR, the first state kabarett stage was opened in 1953, Berlin's Die Distel. It was censored and had to be very careful in criticizing the state (1954: Die Pfefferm√ºhle in Leipzig). In the 1960s, West German kabarett was centred on D√ºsseldorf, Munich, and Berlin. At the end of the decade, the students' movement of May 1968 split opinion on the genre as some old kabarett artists were booed off the stage for being part of the old establishment. In the 1970s, new forms of kabarett developed, such as the television show Notizen aus der Provinz. At the end of the 1980s, kabarett was an important part of social criticism, with a minor boom at the time of German reunification. In eastern Germany, kabarett artists had been growing more and more daring in their criticism of politicians in the time leading up to 1989. After reunification, new social problems, such as mass unemployment, the privatization of companies, and rapid changes in society, meant that cabarets rose in number. Dresden, for example, gained two new cabarets alongside the popular Herkuleskeule. In the 1990s and at the start of the new millennium, the television and film comedy boom and a lessening of public interest in politics meant that television kabarett audiences in Germany dropped. In order to increase interest again the Walk of Fame of Cabaret in Mainz is honoring selected cabaret celebrities; many past cabaret celebrities are honored by stars and each year a star for a living one is added.

Stephanie Lenz posted on YouTube a home video of her child dancing to Prince's song \\"Let's Go Crazy\\".Let's Go Crazy YouTube video Universal Music Corporation (Universal) sent YouTube a takedown notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claiming that Lenz's video violated their copyright in the \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" song. Lenz claimed fair use of the copyrighted material and sued Universal for misrepresentation of a DMCA claim. In a decision rejecting a motion to dismiss the misrepresentation claim, the district court held that Universal must consider fair use when filing a takedown notice, but noted that to prevail a plaintiff would need to show bad faith by a rights holder.Lenz v. Universal Music Corp, 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150 (N.D. Cal. 2008). Facts In February 2007, Stephanie Lenz posted on YouTube a 29-second clip of her 13-month-old son dancing to Prince's song \\"Let's Go Crazy\\". The audio was of poor quality, and the song was audible for about 20 seconds of the 29 seconds. In June 2007, Universal, the copyright holder for \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", sent YouTube a takedown notice in compliance with DMCA requirements, claiming the video was a copyright violation. YouTube removed the video, and notified Lenz of the removal and the alleged infringement. At the end of June 2007, Lenz sent YouTube a counter-notification, claiming fair use and requesting the video be reposted. Six weeks later, YouTube reposted the video. In July 2007, Lenz sued Universal for misrepresentation under the DMCA, and sought a declaration from the court that her use of the copyrighted song was non- infringing. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512, see (f). According to the DMCA 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c)(3)(A)(v), the copyright holder must consider whether use of the material was allowed by the copyright owner or the law. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512, see (c)(3)(A)(v). In September 2007, Prince released statements that he intended to \\"reclaim his art on the internet\\".Reuters, \\"Prince to sue YouTube, eBay over music use\\" (September 13, 2007). In October 2007, Universal released a statement that Prince and Universal intended to remove all user-generated content involving Prince from the Internet, as a matter of principle. Decision District court Based on Prince's and Universal's statements, Lenz argued that Universal was issuing takedown notices in bad faith, as they attempted to remove all Prince-related content rather than considering whether each posting violated copyright, and in particular was a non-infringing fair use. Universal expressed concerns over the fact-intensive investigation and subjective results of determining whether a potentially infringing use falls under the general fair use doctrine. The district court held that copyright owners must consider fair use before issuing DMCA takedown notices. Thus, the district court denied Universal's motion to dismiss Lenz's claims, and declined to dismiss Lenz's misrepresentation claim as a matter of law. The district court believed that Universal's concerns over the burden of considering fair use were overstated, as mere good faith consideration of fair use, not necessarily an in-depth investigation, is sufficient defense against misrepresentation. The court also explained that liability for misrepresentation is crucial in an important part of the balance in the DMCA. On February 25, 2010, Judge Fogel issued a ruling rejecting several of Universal's affirmative defenses, including the defense that Lenz suffered no damages, though the court did suggest that at that stage in the proceedings, Lenz's damages seemed nominal.\\"http://thepriorart.typepad.com/the_prior_art/files/Lenz.2.25.order.pdf\\" In January 2013, Judge Fogel denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.Lenz v. Universal, Order Denying Motions for Summary Judgment, Jan. 14. 2013. Ninth Circuit Recording of oral arguments in the appeal to the Ninth Circuit Both parties cross appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument was held July 7, 2015. On September 14, 2015, the 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court, holding that while fair use arises procedurally as an affirmative defense, copyright holders have a \\"duty to consider‚Äîin good faith and prior to sending a takedown notification‚Äîwhether allegedly infringing material constitutes fair use\\".Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 801 F.3d 1126 (2015), (9th Cir. 2015) Importantly, the court viewed fair use not as a valid excuse to otherwise infringing conduct but rather as not infringement in the first place. \\"Because 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 10717 U.S.C. ¬ß 107. created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is 'authorized by the law' and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under ¬ß 512(c).\\"  Supreme Court  Lenz appealed to the US Supreme Court asking the question: The US Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari in this case on June 19, 2017.Certiorari Denied - Lenz v.

Universal Music Corp."},{"id":"25043252","text":"When analysing the regularities and structure of music as well as the processing of music in the brain, certain findings lead to the question of whether music is based on a syntax that could be compared with linguistic syntax. To get closer to this question it is necessary to have a look at the basic aspects of syntax in language, as language unquestionably presents a complex syntactical system. If music has a matchable syntax, noteworthy equivalents to basic aspects of linguistic syntax have to be found in musical structure. By implication the processing of music in comparison to language could also give information about the structure of music. Comparison to linguistic syntax Syntax in general can be referred to as a study of the principles and rules needed for the construction of a language or as a term in particular describing these principles and rules for a special language. Linguistic syntax ‚Äì three principlesPatel, A.D. (2008). Music, Language, and the Brain. Oxford University Press, USA Linguistic syntax is especially marked by its structural richness, which becomes apparent in its multi layered organization as well as in the strong relationship between syntax and meaning. That is that there are special linguistic syntactic principles that define how the language is formed out of different subunits, such as words out of morphemes, phrases out of words and sentences out of phrases. Furthermore, linguistic syntax is featured by the fact that a word can take on abstract grammatical functions that are less defined through properties of the word itself and more through the context and structural relations. This is for example that every noun can be used as a subject, object or indirect object, but without a sentence as the normal context of a word, no statement about its grammatical function can be made. At last, linguistic syntax is marked by abstractness. This means that only conventional structural relations and not psychoacoustic relationships are the basis for the linguistic syntax. Musical syntax Concerning musical syntax these three aspects of richness in linguistic syntax as well as the abstractness should be found in music too, if one wants to claim that music has a comparable syntax. An annotation that has to be made concerns the fact that most of the studies dealing with musical syntax are confined to the consideration of Western European tonal music. Thus this article can also only focus on Western tonal music. =Multilayered organization= Considering the multilayered organization of music, three levels of pitch organization can be found in music. Scale degrees The lowest level are musical scales, which consist of seven tones or \\"scale degrees\\" per octave and have an asymmetric pattern of intervals between them (for example the C-major scale). They are built up out of the 12 possible pitch classes per octave (A, A,B, C, C, D, D, E, F, F, G, G) and the different scale tones are not equal in their structural stability. Empirical evidence indicates that there is a hierarchy concerning the stability of the single tones. The most stable one is called the \\"tonic\\" and embodies the tonal centre of the scale. The most unstable tones were the ones closest to the tonic (scale degrees 2 and 7), which are called the \\"supertonic\\" and the \\"leading tone\\". In studies scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 have been judged as closely related. It was also shown that an implicit knowledge of scale structure has to be learned and developed in childhood and is not inborn. Chord structure The next superordinate level of pitch organization is the chord structure, which means that three scale tones with a distance of two scale steps each are played simultaneously and are therefore combined into chords. When building up chords on the basis of a musical scale there are three different kinds of chords resulting, namely \\"major\\"(e.g. C-E-G), \\"minor\\" (e.g. D-F-A) and \\"diminished\\" (e.g. B-D-F) triads. This is due to the asymmetric intervals between the scale tones. These asymmetric intervals effect, that a distance of two scale steps can comprise either three or four semitones and therefore be an interval of a minor (with three semitones) or a major (with four semitones) third. A major triad consists of a major third followed by a minor third and is built on scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 (or 4, 6 and 1, for the subdominant, and 5, 7 and 2, for the dominant, the other two major triads that can be formed from the major scale). A minor triad consists of a minor third followed by a major third and is built on scale degrees 2, 4 and 6 (or 3, 5 and 7, for the mediant, and 6, 1 and 4, for the submediant). Only on scale degree 7 the triad consists of two minor thirds and is therefore defined as a diminished triad. Chordal syntax touches mainly four basic aspects. The first is, that the lowest note in each triad functions as a fundament of the chord and therefore as the structural most important pitch. The chord is named after this note as well as the chord's harmonic label is grounded on it. The second aspect is, that chord syntax provides norms for altering chords by additional tones. One example is the addition of a fourth tone to a triad, which is the seventh tone of the scale (e.g. in a C-major scale the addition of F to the triad G-B-D would lead to a so-called \\"dominant seventh chord\\"). Concerning norms for the progression of chords in time the third aspect focuses on the relationship between chords. The patterning of chords in a cadence for example indicates a movement from a V chord to a I chord. The fact that the I chord is perceived as a resting point in a musical phrase implicates, that the single chords built up on notes of a scale are not equal in there stability but show the same differences in stability as the notes of the scale do. This describes the fourth basic aspect of chordal syntax. The tonic chord (the one built on the tonic, C-E-G in C-major, for example) is the most stable and central chord, followed by the dominant chord (built on the 5th scale degree) and the subdominant chord (built on the 4th scale degree). \\" Key structure The highest level of pitch organization can be seen in key structure. In Western European tonal music the key is based on a scale with its associated chords and chord relations. Scales can be built up as minor or major scales (differing in the succession of intervals between the scale tones) on each of the 12 pitch classes and therefore there are 24 possible keys in tonal music. Analysing key structure in context of musical syntax means to examine the relationship between keys in a piece of music. Usually, not only one key is used to build up a composition, but also so-called key \\"modulations\\" (in other words the alteration of keys) are utilized. In these modulations a certain recurring pattern can be perceived. Switches from one key to another are often found between related keys. Three general principles for relationship between keys can be postulated on the basis of perceptual experiments and also neural evidence for implicit knowledge of key structure. Looking at the C-major key as an example, there are three close related keys: G-major, A-minor and C-minor. C-major and G-major are keys whose 1st scale degrees are separated by a musical fifth (the pattern of relations is represented in the circle of fifths\\" for major keys). A-minor and C-major share the same notes of the scale but with a different tonic (so-called relative minor key, i.e. C-major and A-minor). And C-major and C-minor have the same tonic in their scales. All in all it can be said that music like the human language has a considerable multi layered organization. =Hierarchical structure= Considering the last two basic aspects of linguistic syntax, namely the considerable significance of the order of subunits for the meaning of a sentence as well as the fact that words undertake abstract grammatical functions defined through context and structural relations, it seems to be useful to analyse the hierarchical structure of music to find correlations in music. Ornamentation One aspect of hierarchical structure of music is the ornamentation. The meaning of the word \\"ornamentation\\" points to the fact that there are events in a musical context that are less important to form an idea of the general gist of a sequence than others. The decision on the importance of events not only comprises harmonic considerations, but also rhythmic and motivic information. But a classification of events simply into ornamental and structural events would be too superficial. In fact the most common hypothesis implies, that music is organized into structural levels, which can be pictured as branches of a tree. A pitch that is structural at a higher level may be ornamental at a deeper level. This can be compared with the hierarchical syntactic structure of a sentence in which there are structural elements that are necessary to build up a sentence like the noun phrase and the verb phrase but looking at a deeper level the structural elements also contain additional or ornamental constituents. Tension and resolution Searching for other aspects of hierarchical structure of music there is a controversial discussion, if the organization of tension and resolution in music can be described as hierarchical structure or only as a purely sequential structure. According to Patel research in this area has produced apparently contradictory evidence, and more research is needed to answer this question. The question concerning the kind of structure that features tension and resolution in music is linked very close to the relationship between order and meaning in music. Considering tension and resolution as one possible kind of meaning in music a hierarchical structure would imply that a change of order of musical elements would have an influence on the meaning of the music. =Abstractness= The last aspect to examine is the abstractness of linguistic syntax and its correlate in music. There are two contradicting points of views. The first one claims that the foundation for musical scales and for the existence of a tonal centre in music can be seen in the physical basis of overtone series or in the psychoacoustic properties of chord in tonal music respectively. But in recent time there is strong evidence for the second point of view that syntax reflects abstract cognitive relationships. All in all the consideration of syntax in music and language shows, that music has a syntax comparable to the linguistic syntax especially concerning a great complexity and a hierarchical organization. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized, that musical syntax is not a simple variant of linguistic syntax, but a similar complex system with its own substance. That means that it would be the wrong way just to search for musical analogies of linguistic syntactic entities such as nouns or verbs. Neuronal processing of musical and linguistic syntax Investigating the neuronal processing of musical syntax can serve two proposed aspects.Patel, A.D. (2003). Language, music, syntax and the brain]. Nature Neuroscience. 6(7):674-681 The first is to learn more about the processing of music in general. That is, which areas of the brain are involved and if there are specific markers of brain activity due to the processing of music and musical syntax. The second aspect is to compare the processing of musical and linguistic syntax to find out, if they have an effect upon each other or if there even is a significant overlap. The verification of an overlap would support the thesis, that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular. \\"Modular\\" means, that the complex system of processing is decomposed into subsystems with modular functions. Concerning the processing of syntax this would mean, that the domain of music and language each have specific syntactic representations, but that they share neural resources for activating and integrating these representations during syntactic processing. Processing of music and musical syntax =Requirements= Processing of music and musical syntax comprises several aspects concerning melodic, rhythmic, metric, timbral and harmonic structure. For the processing of chord functions four steps in processing can be described. (1)Primarily, a tonal centre has to be detected out of the first chords of a sequence. Often the first chord is interpreted as the tonal centre of a sequence and a reevaluation is necessary, if the first chord has another harmonic function. (2)Successive chords are related to this tonal centre concerning their harmonic distance from the tonal centre. (3)As described above (Does music have a syntax?), music has a hierarchical structure in terms of pitch organization and organization of tensioning and releasing in music. Pitch organization concerning chords means, that in a musical phrase the tonic is the most stable chord and experienced as the resting point. The dominant and subdominant anon are more stable than the submediant and the supertonic. The progression of chords in time forms a tonal structure based on pitch organization, in which moving away from the tonic is perceived as tensioning and moving towards the tonic is experienced as releasing. Therefore, hierarchical relations may convey organized patterns of meaning. (4)Concerning harmonic aspects of major-minor tonal music, Musical syntax can be characterized by statistical regularities in the succession of chord functions in time, that is probabilities of chord transitions. As these regularities are stored in a long-term memory, predictions about following chords are made automatically, when listening to a musical phrase. =MMN and ERANKoelsch, S. (2009). \\"Music-syntactic Processing and Auditory Memory ‚Äì Similarities and Differences between ERAN and MMN\\". Psychophysiology, 46(1): 179-190.= The violation of these automatically made predictions lead to the observation of so-called ERPs (event related potential, a stereotyped electrophysiological response to an internal or external stimulus). Two forms of ERPs can be detected in the context of processing music. One is the MMN (mismatch negativity), which has first been investigated only with physical deviants like frequency, sound intensity, timbre deviants (referred to as phMMN) and could now also be shown for changes of abstract auditory features like tone pitches (referred to as afMMN). The other one is the so-called ERAN (early right anterior negativity), which can be elicited by syntactic irregularities in music. Both the ERAN and the MMN are ERPs indicating a mismatch between predictions based on regularities and actually experienced acoustic information. As for a long time it seemed to be, that the ERAN is a special variant of the MMN, the question arises, why they are told apart today. There are several differences between the MMN and the ERAN found in the last years: Differences ‚Äì occurrence Even though music syntactic regularities are often simultaneously acoustical similar and music syntactic irregularities are often simultaneously acoustical different, an ERAN but not an MMN can be elicit, when a chord does not represent a physical but a syntactic deviance. To demonstrate this, so-called \\"Neapolitan sixth chords\\" are used. These are consonant chords when played solitary, but which are added into a musical phrase of in which they are only distantly related to the harmonic context. Added into a chord sequence of five chords, the addition of a Neapolitan sixth chord at the third or at the fifth position evokes different amplitudes of ERANs in the EEG with a higher amplitude at the fifth position. Nevertheless, when creating a chord sequence in which the Neapolitan chord at the fifth position is music-syntactically less irregular than a Neapolitan chord at the third position, the amplitude is higher at the third position (see figure 4...). In opposition to the MMN, a clear ERAN is also elicited by using syntactically irregular chords, which are acoustically more similar to a proceeding harmonic context than syntactically regular chords. Therefore, the MMN seems to be based on an on-line establishment of regularities. That means, that the regularities are extracted on-line from the acoustic environment. In opposition, the ERAN rests upon representations of music-syntactic regularities which exist in a long-term memory format and which are learned during early childhood. Differences ‚Äì development This is represented in the development of the ERAN and MMN. The ERAN cannot be verified in newborn babies, whereas the MMN can actually be demonstrated in fetus. In two-year-old children, the ERAN is very small, in five-year-old children a clear ERAN is found, but with a longer latency than in adults. With the age of 11 years children show an ERAN similar to ERANs in adults. Out of these observation the thesis can be built that the MMN is essential for the establishment and maintenance of representations of the acoustic environment and for processes of the auditory scene analysis. But only the ERAN is completely based on learning to build up a structural model, which is established with reference to representations of syntactic regularities already existing in a long-term memory format. Considering effects of training both the ERAN and the MMN can be modulated by training. Differences ‚Äì neural sources Differences between the ERAN and the MMN also exist in the neural sources for the main contributions to the ERPs. The sources for the ERAN are located in the pars opercularis of the inferior fronto-lateral cortex (inferior Brodmann's area with contributions from the ventrolateral premotor cortex and the anterior superior temporal gyrus, whereas the MMN receives its main contributions from and within the vicinity of the primary auditory cortex with additional sources in the frontal cortical areas. Therefore, the sources for the ERAN basically lie in the frontal cortex whereas the sources for the MMN are located in the temporal lobe. Other hints for this thesis emerge from the fact that under a propofol sedation which mainly affects the frontal cortex, the ERAN is abolished while the MMN is only reduced. At last, the amplitude of the ERAN is reduced under ignore conditions whereas the MMN is largely unaffected by attentional modulations. Processes to elicit the MMN or ERAN (1)First, a separation of sound sources, an extraction of sound features and the establishment of representations of auditory objects of the incoming acoustic input have to be made. The same processes are required for the MMN and ERAN. (2)For the MMN regularities are filtered on-line out of the input to create a model of the acoustic environment. At this point, there is a difference to the ERAN as for the ERAN representations of regularities already exist in a long-term memory format and the incoming sound is integrated into a pre existent model of musical structure. (3)According to the model of musical structure, predictions concerning forthcoming auditory events are formed. This process is similar for the ERAN and for the MMN. (4)At least a comparison between the actually incoming sound and the predictions based on the model is made. This process is partly the same for the MMN and the ERAN as well.  Comparison of the processing of musical and linguistic syntax As the ERAN is similar to an ERP called ELAN which can be elicited by violation of linguistic syntax it seems to be obvious that the ERAN really represents syntactic processing. Deduced from this thought an interaction between music- syntactic and language-syntactic processing would be very likely.There are different possibilities in neuroscience to approach to an answer to the question of an overlap between the neuronal processing of linguistic and musical syntax. =Neuropsychological approach= This method deals with the question, how structure and function of the brain relate to outcomes in behaviour and other psychological processes. From this area of research there has been evidence for the dissociation between musical and linguistic syntactic abilities. In case reports it was possible to show that amusia ( a deficiency in fine-grainded perception of pitch which leads to musical tone- deafness and can be congenital or acquired later in life as from brain damage) is not necessarily linked to aphasia (severe language impairments following brain damage) and vice versa. This means that individuals with normal speech and language abilities showed musical tone-deafness as well as individuals with language impairments had sufficient means of musical syntactic abilities. The problem of neuropsychologic research is that there has not been a former case report which showed that aphasia does not necessarily entail amusia in non-musicians, to the contrary newer findings suggest that amusia is almost always linked to aphasia. =Neuroimaging= Furthermore, results from neuroimaging led to the \\"shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis\\" (SSIRH), which supports the presumption, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and that syntactic operations are modular. Furthermore, research using the method of electroencephalography has shown that a difficulty or irritation in musical as well as in linguistic syntax elicit ERPs which are similar to each other. How can the discrepancy between neuropsychology and neuroimaging be explained? =Modularity= In fact, the concept of modularity itself can help to understand the different and apparently contradicting findings in neuropsychologic research and neuroimaging. Introducing the concept of a dual system, in which there is a distinction between syntactic representation and syntactic processing, this could mean, that there is a distinction between long-term structural knowledge in a domain (representation) and operations conducted on that knowledge (syntactic processing). A damage in an area representing long-term musical knowledge would lead to amusia without aphasia, but a damage in an area representing syntactic processing would cause an impairment of both musical and linguistic syntactic processing. =Comparison of syntactic processing- three theories= The comparison of the syntactic processing of language and music is based on three theories which should be mentioned but which are not explained in detail. The first two, the \\"dependency locality theory\\" and the \\"expectancy theory\\" refer to syntactic processing in language, whereas the third one, the \\"tonal pitch space theory\\", relates to the syntactic processing in music. The language theories contribute to the concept that in order to conceive the structure of a sentence, resources are consumed. If the conception of a this structure is difficult due to the fact that distant words belong to each other or an expected structure of the sentence is violated, more resources, namely the ones for activating low-activation items, are consumed. Violating an anticipated structure in music could mean a harmonically unexpected note or chord in a musical sequence. As in language this is associated with a \\"processing cost due to the tonal distance\\" (Patel, 2008) and therefore means that more resources are needed for activating low- activation items. =SSIRH ‚Äì the leading concept= Overall these theories lead to the \\"shared syntactic integration resources hypothesis\\" as the areas from which low-activation items are activated could be the correlate to the overlap between linguistic and musical syntax. Strong evidence for the existence of this overlap comes from studies, in which music-syntactic and a linguistic-syntactic irregularities were presented simultaneously. They showed an interaction between the ERAN and the LAN (left anterior negativity;ERP which is elicited by linguistic-syntactic irregularities). The LAN elicited was reduced when an irregular word was presented simultaneously with an irregular chord compared to the condition when an irregular word was presented with a regular chord. Contrary to this finding the phMMN elicited by frequency deviants did not interact with the LAN. From this facts it can be reasoned that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (Koelsch 2008). Furthermore, they give strong evidence for the thesis, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and therefore that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular.

It ran for three seasons from 2009 to 2012 and was canceled in 2013. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\-  Format  Former Navy Underwater Demolition Team (UDT), professional wrestler, actor and Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura examines various conspiracy theories on subjects such as global warming, the September 11 attacks, secret societies, government surveillance and secret weapons projects. In the first season, Ventura teams up with a group of investigators consisting of skeptic Alex Piper, reporter June Sarpong and investigator Michael Braverman. In season two, Piper is replaced by investigator Daniel Kucan in a few episodes. In season three, Ventura's son, Tyrel Ventura, and Oliver Stone's son, Sean Stone, are part of the investigative team.  Ratings and reviews  The premiere episode was watched by 1.635 million viewers, TruTV's biggest audience for a new series launch. The next two episodes were watched by 1.586 million and 1.301 million viewers. Over the first three episodes the series averaged 1.5 million viewers, up 60% from the same time slot a year before. During January the show averaged 1.6 million viewers, helping truTV deliver its biggest month ever in prime time. Critics who have reviewed the show include Linda Stasi of New York Post, who called it \\"mindless, good fun and a hoot to watch aging action stars still taking action\\", and Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote, \\"Whatever truth is out there, it's filtered here through what is arranged more as an adventure series than a documentary.\\"  Controversy  'Police State' criticism An episode from season two titled \\"Police State\\" caused some controversy when it investigated allegations that various prison-like facilities built around the country that are operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be used during martial law for the internment of citizens who are deemed a threat to national security. Officials have said the facilities are emergency FEMA camps for the housing of civilians displaced by natural disasters. U.S. Representative Steve Cohen from Tennessee, a co-sponsor of a bill which aimed to create temporary FEMA camps for the housing of people affected by hurricanes or earthquakes in his district, was interviewed for the show. Shortly after the episode aired, Cohen called for the removal of this program from truTV's lineup. He called the episode an \\"outrageous distortion and an outright lie,\\" as well as \\"dangerous and irresponsible.\\" He said \\"when the media purposely distort the facts to create confusion and mislead people, they must be held accountable. Unless we actively debunk false and misleading reports, we risk leaving the public with a dangerously skewed vision of this country.\\" Cohen said he was \\"shocked and appalled\\" that Time Warner would air a program \\"so full of inaccuracies and irresponsible distortions.\\"Lawmaker: Jesse Ventura's show on U.S. concentration camps 'outrageous' Another allegation brought up in the episode focused on a private facility outside Covington, Georgia, that was stockpiling thousands of plastic bins alleged to be used as coffins for mass burials. In a response to the criticism, Misty Skedgell, a Turner spokesperson, described Conspiracy Theory as an \\"entertainment program that appears on an entertainment network.\\" Although most of the episodes of Conspiracy Theory have been rerun, the \\"Police State\\" episode has been shown only once, owing largely to the controversy surrounding the content of the episode. Production issues After two seasons of the show, the creation of future episodes was in doubt when, on January 25, 2011, the Drudge Report announced that Ventura had filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), for what he calls \\"warrant-less and suspicion-less scans and body searches.\\" Ventura, who has a titanium hip replacement, claimed that he sets off metal detectors and is always pulled out of line for lengthy pat-downs. The day of the announcement, Alex Jones, a consultant and frequent guest, said on his show that he had witnessed a pat-down of Ventura at the Atlanta International Airport while filming for Conspiracy Theory, during which Ventura loudly protested that \\"America is turning into East Germany.\\" Jones said Ventura, who flew two to three times a week for Conspiracy Theory, refuses to fly commercially again, a vow he reiterated after his lawsuit against the TSA was dismissed in November 2011. Although there were concerns that Ventura would not be able to continue hosting Conspiracy Theory as a result of his lawsuit and refusal to fly commercially, it was revealed in September 2011 that he would host a third season that would be completed and launched on TruTV sometime in 2012. On June 26, 2012, Jones interviewed Ventura. When the two discussed the third season, Ventura confirmed that filming on the third season was completed in November 2011 and said the season was supposed to air in January or February 2012 but for unknown reasons had not yet aired as of that point. The delay led Ventura to suspect that the show was cancelled. On July 31, 2012, Jesse's son, Tyrel Ventura, appeared on the Alex Jones radio show to discuss the upcoming third season. Tyrel dismissed allegations that the show was officially canceled, or that any of the new episodes were being censored. Tyrel said a change in management at the production company had caused delays. He also confirmed that the new episodes were still being finalized and edited for TruTV. In May 2013, Ventura confirmed that the show has been discontinued and there will be no fourth season. Unshown \\"TSA\\" episode On October 30, 2012 Jesse Ventura made an appearance on the Alex Jones radio show and made it known that the final episode of the third season, an episode involving the Transportation Security Administration, would not be shown. He declined to mention what the reason was, only that \\"the decision was made at TruTV, if you want to know, ask them.\\" Had the episode aired, it was to cover allegations that former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff made huge profits off measures he enacted for airline safety, especially with full body scanners that were manufactured by firms he invested in. Additionally, Ventura was to investigate alleged \\"cancer clusters\\" centered around TSA workers who were exposed to the machines on a daily basis.

He first achieved success as an Abstract Expressionist painter, but changed course in the early 1960s and became a painter of realistic figurative paintings. Biography Alfred Leslie was born in New York. After service in the US Coast Guard at the end of World War II, Leslie studied art at New York University, the Art Students League, and Pratt Institute.Benezra 1998, p.168. A bodybuilder and hand-balancer, Leslie posed for artist Reginald Marsh and others and modeled for classes at the Art Students League and Pratt Institute.Judith Stein, Art in America, January 2009, pp. 88-95. Anticipating the Situationist International's detournement, his 1949 film Magic Thinking combined black-and-white cartoons, home movies, GI training films, industrial commercials, strip footage and old feature films. To raise the $250 required of by Tibor de Nagy Gallery to exhibit there in 1952, he appeared on Strike It Rich, an early reality television program, and won. His 1952 exhibition included The Bed-Sheet Painting, a 12 by 16 foot, black painting with a scumbled surface and white bar mounted on unstretched canvas. In the '50s, he made sculptures using seemingly insignificant materials such as plumber's tape, stapes, grommets, nails, housepaint. Anticipating John Chamberlain's sculptures made from recycled cars, Leslie tied together car mufflers and tail pipes with rope after hammering and reassembling them. In 1955, a collector gave him a Polaroid camera, driving him to take hundreds of police-style mugshots, of which only photos of Sam Francis and Al Held survived. Invited to partake in the Moderna Museet's \\"Art in Motion\\" (1961) exhibition, curated by Pontus Hulten, Leslie proposed Jolly, a kit with the ingredients to make an inflatable sculpture. Anticipating Andy Warhol's Clouds (1966), he proposed that a massive weather balloon suspend a brick over an inflated wading pool. In 1962, having gained recognition as a second generation Abstract Expressionist painter, Leslie abruptly changed course. His new works were realistic figurative paintings in grisaille, of which he later said, \\"there was a point at which I realized that if my work was to develop and evolve, and if I was to mature as an artist, these figurative ideas could not be ignored, even though following them could seem to imply that I would be turning my back on the twentieth century, turning my back on my abstract achievement\\". On October 17, 1966, nearly all of Leslie's monochrome paintings were destroyed in a fire. Shortly afterwards, Leslie introduced color into his paintings, which have been widely exhibited. Leslie's solo exhibitions include those at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1976); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC (1976-77); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1977); Wichita Art Museum, Kansas (1984); Boca Raton Museum of Art, Florida (1989); and St. Louis Art Museum, Missouri (1991).Leslie 1991, p. 13. Even though figuration and narration became contentious issues for painters in the 1980s, \\"these concerns didn't exist per se in film, theater, literary or still photography world, all of which I was part of.\\" Leslie is also known for his large scale charcoal drawings, and for his work as a photographer and filmmaker. Together with Robert Frank, Leslie directed the short film Pull My Daisy in 1959. The film, narrated by Jack Kerouac, was selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1996. He also created the films Directions: A Walk after the War Games (1946-9), The Last Clean Shirt with the poet Frank O'Hara (1964), The Cedar Bar (2001), Einstein's Secret (2008) and the animated film The New York Story (1963).

It serves the academic community of the University of Potsdam as well as interested readers from other universities and non-university research institutes in the Potsdam and Berlin area. The library is also open to private users from the region Berlin-Brandenburg with a research or study interest. Structure and organization The University Library of Potsdam is a library system with a single budget and central library staff management. It comprises three divisional libraries (‚ÄûBereichsbibliotheken‚Äú), one at each of the three university campuses. The holdings in the fields of the humanities are housed in the Communs of the New Palace at Park Sanssouci, a UNESCO World Heritage Site; the holdings in the fields of Law, Economics and Social Sciences are located on the campus of Potsdam-Babelsberg a section of Potsdam well known for its film studios; and resources in the fields of Human and Natural Sciences can be found in the library building of the City of Science at Potsdam-Golm.Wissenschaftspark Potsdam-Golm The University Archives and the University Press are part of the University Library. In the context of the structural reform of the German library system the University Library of Potsdam is cooperating with various regional and supraregional acting institutions as partner libraries, archives, museums et al. The objective is to build an efficiency network which concentrates and shares resources and optimizes staff utilization. With rapid technological change transforming the information-seeking behavior, libraries have to adapt and provide scientists and citizens as well as students and trainees with modern collections and innovative work spaces. History The University Library was founded in 1991 as part of the University of Potsdam, which was founded one year after the reunification of Germany. It contains the holdings of previous institutions such as the Karl Liebknecht College of Education and the Academy of Justice and the State of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). After years of having to repeatedly move the library to different buildings, the library was able to move into functionally appropriate quarters: in 2000 to a former depot of the German Red Cross in Babelsberg, which was converted into an attractive structure and in 2006 to an extensively refurbished back building (remise) at South Commun, extended by a new glass building at the New Palace.Bibliotheksneubau am Neuen Palais The first real library building of the university,IKMZ an information and communication center located in the City of Science in Potsdam-Golm, will be completed in 2011. It will provide readers with 6,800 square meters of usable space, a capacity of 1 million volumes, large reading and multimedia areas, carrels, group study rooms and a special reading room for rare material. Holdings The library‚Äôs holdings number about 1,3 million volumes, 27,000 e-journals, 260 databases and 1,5 million e-books. The University Library of Potsdam is a library of medium scale in German comparison. It is a member of the Kooperativer Bibliotheksverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (KOBV), a library network, with which it collaborates in the field of innovative electronic publishing. It is also co- operation partner of the library network GBV (Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund) in the fields of shared cataloguing and interlibrary-loan. In the first years of the university (1991‚Äì2002) a core collection could be built based on the Hochschulbauf√∂rderungsgesetz, a German law that defined the development of academic institutions as a common mission of the Federal Government and the States. The collections are now being systematically developed . Various disciplines are covered, representing the interdisciplinary focus of the university and the idea of the universitas litterarum, the institutional representation of all of the traditionally relevant disciplines of knowledge . The development plan for universities in Brandenburg until 2025 names as its fields of research excellence and expertise: teacher education, media studies, science, Jewish studies et al. About half of the collections of the University Library of Potsdam are open access holdings shelved according to the Regensburg classification system (RVK), which is widely used in Germany. An interlibrary loan system allows registered users to request material held at other sites. There are about 430,000 lending transactions annually and 28,000 registered borrowers. An increase in efficiency is a result of the introduction of RFID (radio frequency identification). The open access holdings of each library site are equipped with transponders and the users borrow and return items quickly using self-service machines. At present, 740 seats are available for readers in the whole library system, 160 of the seats have workstations, enable online catalogue and or Internet access.

Furthermore, the University Library of Potsdam is a United Nations Depository Library. University Archives The Archives of the Brandenburg State College (Brandenburgische Landeshochschule), whose direct predecessor institution were the Archives of the Karl Liebknecht College of Education created in 1966, became the University Archives in 1991. It contains the holdings of current administrative records as well as documents of permanent value. The archives of the University of Potsdam currently take up about 1,800 running meters. They preserve collections of the following former institutions: *Brandenburg State College, Potsdam *Karl Liebknecht College of Education, Potsdam *Rosa Luxemburg College of Education, Potsdam *Academy of Justice and the State, Potsdam-Babelsberg. The University Archives are a public service institution. It is the repository of historically valuable records of the University of Potsdam. The University Archives acquire, organize and promote the use and, as the case may be, the publication of these materials. Potsdam University Press The publication service section of the University Library of Potsdam, founded in 1998, enhances both print- and e-publishing and consolidates the responsibilities for the University Press, the UP open archive, the bibliography of publications of the University and the exchange department. Potsdam University Press stands for the principles of open and permanent access to the scholarly information and ideas and facilitates their wider dissemination according to the resolution of the Senate of the University of May 17, 2006.Open Access Resolution It has established an editorial platform by publishing peer-reviewed contents.

After briefly working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he served in the United States Navy during World War II teaching aircraft mechanics. Career Snider held a variety of jobs throughout his life, working in journalism, politics, sports, and the oil industry. He got his start in journalism in the 1950s as a sports editor for the Topeka Capital-Journal. After being promoted to managing editor, he went on to work for president John F. Kennedy as administrator of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.\\"History of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports\\", 2006 From there, he founded NCAA films, where he produced the television show \\"College Football,\\" the first Sunday morning show to nationally broadcast college football highlights.\\"NCAA Record\\", 2004 With his background in communications, he was then hired to be Vice President of Communications for Vickers Oil in Wichita, Kansas. He retired in 1985, returning to the newspaper business to write a thrice-weekly column for the Topeka Capital-Journal for the next seventeen years. His column became well known for its cynical humor. Though usually aimed at people in power, his comical attacks were often directed at friends, family, and himself. In 2002, the column was picked up by the Metro News, where he wrote until his death in 2004. Death Snider died of cancer on November 20, 2004 at his home in Topeka, Kansas. Because of his popular mockery of Topeka-based Westboro Baptist Church, the church picketed his funeral. He was survived by his wife, five children, and nine grandchildren.

Setting √éle Amsterdam and √éle Saint-Paul are two volcanoes 83 km from each other lying in the centre of a triangle between Australia, Antarctica and southern Africa. The islands are remote, situated about 3000 km (1860 mi) from each neighboring continent. They have cool oceanic climates with temperatures ranging from 13 ¬∞C (55 ¬∞F) in August to 17 ¬∞C (63 ¬∞F) in February, rainfall of 1,100 mm (43 in), persistent westerly winds, and high humidity levels. Flora Plant life changes with elevation; at lower levels the volcanoes are covered with grass and tussock grasslands and sedge meadows and, on Amsterdam, the tree Phylica arborea mixed with ferns. Higher up, on the Plateau des Tourbi√®res, there are shrubs, bogs, and mosses. Fauna These isolated islands are not rich in wildlife diversity but are home to a large population of subantarctic fur seal. They are an important breeding ground for the Indian yellow-nosed albatross, flesh-footed shearwater, gentoo penguin, northern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes moseleyi) great skua, Antarctic tern and the endemic Amsterdam albatross. They were formerly home to two endemic ducks: the Amsterdam wigeon and an undescribed species on √éle Saint-Paul. Threats and conservation Although the islands are remote and therefore safe from most human activity and pollution, several introduced species of both flora and fauna have damaged the environment. Feral cattle, in particular, grazed on young and regenerating plants and trampled on bird eggs. Five cattle had been brought to Amsterdam in January 1871. They were abandoned later that year and subsequently increased to a wild population of 2,000. As part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands the islands are home to a research base which is working to preserve the original plant and animal life. Initially, they restricted the cattle to the northern half of Amsterdam. When the discovery was made in 2007 that the native flora and fauna had returned to the areas no longer grazed by the cattle, a plan to cull the remaining cattle on the island was launched in 2008. By 2010, the eradication program was complete, and no cattle remain on the island. The cattle population itself had become of scientific interest as it was a rare example of a feral, unmanned herd of cattle. Humans have caused other damage to the islands' ecosystems, as much of Amsterdam's woodland was cleared in the 18th and 19th centuries by whalers, sealer, and visitors from passing ships and is struggling to recover. Seal populations have recovered from the commercial seal hunting, and are no longer threatened. The only way to visit the islands is on the French research vessel Marion Dufresne II which services the Martin- de-Vivi√®s research station on Amsterdam Island.

She was known as Mrs. Pitman after her marriage. In the Hawaiian language, kino 'ole means \\"thin\\" and liliha can mean \\"heartsick\\".  Life  Her father was High Chief Ho ªolulu. Her paternal grandfather was High Chief Kame ªeiamoku, one of the royal twins (with Kamanawa) who advised Kamehameha I, and her paternal grandmother was High Chiefess Kahikoloa. Her mother was High Chiefess Charlotte Halaki Cox, whose father lent his name to Keeaumoku II, the Governor of Maui. Her father and uncle Hoapili were chosen to conceal the bones of Kamehameha I in a secret hiding place after his death. They placed the bones of the king in a cave along the coastline; it was a great honor to be the last to touch the bones of the king. Her brothers were the High Chief Kaihe ªekai and the High Chief Mo ªoheau-nui-i-Kaaiawaawa-o- ªUlu and her only known sister was the High Chiefess Kahinu-o-kekuaukalani, who married William Beckley (1814‚Äì1871), the hapa-haole son of Captain George Charles Beckley (1787‚Äì1826), an English sea captain and close friend of Kamehameha I, and his Hawaiian wife, the Chiefess Ahia (1792‚Äì1854). Some of her famous cousins are: High Chief Kamanawa II and High Chief  ªAikanaka, sons of her uncle High Chief Kepo ªokalani and grandfathers of Queen Lili ªuokalani and King David KalƒÅkaua; the High Chiefess Kapi ªolani, daughter of her aunt High Chiefess Kekikipa ªa; the High Chiefess Keouawahine, daughter of her aunt High Chiefess Loewahine and grandmother of Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani; and Kuini Liliha, the daughter of her uncle the High Chief Hoapili. From her father she inherited vast lands in Hilo and Ola ªa. King Kamehameha III granted her control of the ahupua ªa of Hilo, thereby making her high chiefess. It was customary that when the lehuas started to bloom, the first blossoms had to be strung into the leis for Kino ªole. These flowers were called the \\"Lehuas of Panaewa\\". This is one of the remnant traces of the kapu system which gave the noble class special privileges and sacredness. She married Benjamin Pitman, born in Salem, Massachusetts who had arrived in Hawaii from New England in 1833. Pitman was a prominent businessman in Hilo and Honolulu. He owned a store or ship chandlery in Hilo and in Honolulu took up banking. This marriage was an example of a businessman marrying a landholding high chiefess. Such marriages paved the way for the ranches, plantations, banks and other businesses, through the investment of foreign capital. Gravestone at Waiola Church, Lahaina In the 1850s, the Pitman family moved to the new capital of Honolulu. They built a beautiful two-story house named Waialeale (\\"rippling water\\") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets, which later became the site of the Honolulu Gas Company office. Surrounded by an iron fence, the walks were paved with tiles. She died in Honolulu, on August 16, 1855, soon after the construction of her new home. She was buried at the Waiola Church, on Maui, where her headstone now stands. However, later reports claimed she was buried on the Island of Hawaii, her ancestral home, and her remains were taken to Hilo with a large entourage of relatives and friends. The people of Hilo, reportedly, swam out in great numbers to the boat and bore the casket on their shoulders.  Children  Portrait of Mary and Henry, painting by John Mix Stanley, 1849 Kino ªole and Benjamin Pitman had three children: #Mary Ann Kino ªole Ka ªaumokulani Pitman (1838/41‚Äì1905), later Mary Ailau, an intimate friend and bridesmaid of Queen Emma, who married Kamehameha IV. In her youth, she was known as the \\"Belle of Hilo Bay\\". She married in late life to Jack Ailau (1860‚Äì1894), a printer and musician of Honolulu. She died childless at Hilo in 1905, ten years after her husband. #Henry Ho ªolulu Pitman (1845‚Äì1863), served in the American Civil War as a private in the Union Army, was taken prisoner and imprisoned at Libby Prison, and died after being released on parole in a prisoner exchange on February 27, 1863. #Benjamin Franklin Keolaokalani Pitman (1852‚Äì1918), married Almira Hollander (1854‚Äì1939), from Brookline, Massachusetts, His wife Almira was credited with helping the women of Hawaii achieve suffrage in 1918. Among their descendants is Theodore Pitman, great- great-grandson of Kino ªole who donated some of his great-great-grandfather's manuscript that accounted the events of the early period of the Kingdom of Hawaii.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1918-07-03/ed-1/seq-7/ The Pitman Tablet was sculpted by her grandson Theodore Baldwin Pitman in honor of the sesquicentennial of Captain James Cook's arrival in Hawaii and the Pitman family of Hawaii  Legacy  Pitman Street in Hilo was named for her husband, but later changed to Kino ªole Street in her honor. The Kinoole Baptist Church, is located at coordinates . In 1851, Benjamin Pitman bought the \\"Post Boy\\", a 44-ton topsail schooner built in Auckland, New Zealand that had arrived from San Francisco on November 22, 1850. It had been previously sold to a native by the name of Philip Nation who registered and ran her for a time under her foreign name. Pitman changed her name to the \\"Kinoole\\" after his wife. The \\"Kinoole\\" plied as a windward packet on various routes, with occasional trips to Kaua ªi. She was sold to R. Robinson and J. A. Simmons in 1852, Jas. Dawson and Paniani in 1853, D. Fredison and T.E. Cook and P.H. Treadway in 1856, A. K. Clark and O. H. Culick in 1858, and later to E. W. Clark and S. L. Austin. On February 1, 1859, the \\"Kinoole\\" sailed from Honolulu and landed on Kealakekua Bay two days later. Onboard was the President of Punahou School who wanted to see the recent eruption of Mauna Loa. On August 24, 1860, she finally wrecked on the shores of Ni ªihau. After her death on August 16, 1855, Pitman remarried, but after his second wife also died, he took his three children to attend schools in Boston. Besides short trips back to Hawaii, her daughter Mary did not return to Hawaii until 1881. Their son Benjamin remained in Massachusetts where he married Almira Hollander Pitman; they visited Hawaii in 1917. Kino ªole's descendants from her son Benjamin still live in Massachusetts. Many of her descendants were named after her.

The paperback version is somewhat different, and was published the same year by Ace Books, as illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon. Plot In the 22nd century, no one has to die of old age any more. The pharmaceuticals division of a large corporation has devised a potion that bestows immortality on a single application, without any need for follow up treatments. The immortality treatment does not and cannot wear off. All it takes is a single dose, and the human will become immortal. However, it has an unusual effect on males that drink it. It effectively neuters them, causing complete cessation of sexual desire and the ability to perform sexually. In this kind of world, many men put off taking the immortality treatment for as long as possible. However, the main character, Will Carewe, is not yet immortal, and wishes to involve his wife in questions as serious as this one. They have not yet had any children. He is a high ranking employee for a transnational corporation that one day approaches him with a confidential question relating to the discovery of an immortality potion that does the same thing that the current one does, but without the undesirable side-effect of turning off the sex drive in males. The desirability of patenting the process requires the corporation to handle related matters under a cloak of secrecy, but somewhere someone has spilled the beans; competitors will do anything for the magic recipe, especially if this can be done before the patent is filed in the US Patent Office. They will do anything, including bribery, extortion, and murder, to get the information out of the pharmaceuticals lab before the process is made public. The hero of the story, Will Carewe, says he is willing to test the new chemical, even if it backfires and results in permanent sterility and complete loss of physical desire and physical ability. But it appears there is someone out there who is willing to do anything to kill him before he does.
