Patients with CSD frequently initially suffer a sudden injury of some sort to their vestibular system, the neurologic network that preserves sense of balance. Even after this initial injury has healed, people with CSD usually describe a vague sense of unsteadiness worsened by triggers in their environment such as high places, standing on moving objects, or standing in motion-rich environments like busy streets or crowds. There is a clear indication that anxiety and other mental illnesses play a role in the dizziness symptoms that occur with CSD. However, the condition is categorized as chronic functional vestibular disorder, not as a structural or psychiatric condition. Proposals include renaming it persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) which better captures the multiple aspects of the condition under its title. It is under that title the World Health Organization has included PPPD in its draft list of diagnoses to be included to the next edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in 2017. Signs and symptoms Symptoms can include: * A constant sense of unsteadiness, rocking or swaying, dizziness or lightheadedness * Disequilibrium on most days for at least 3 months * Spatial orientation problems * Off-kilter sensation * Extreme sensitivity to movement and/or complex visual stimuli such as grocery stores or driving in certain weather conditions * Worsening dizziness with experience of complex visual environments such as walking through a grocery store * Heavy-headedness; a feeling of floating, wooziness Symptoms of CSD can be worsened by any self precipitated motion, usually from the head, or the witnessing of motion from another subject. These are usually less noticeable when the person is laying still. Triggers Visual stimuli, body movements, sleep deprivation, and crowding are found to be the most common triggers of PPPD. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be difficult as there is not a specific test for PPPD but rather a series of elimination tests for other vestibular causes. If elimination test are all normal and the symptoms match a PPPD diagnosis is possible. Treatment Effective treatments include vestibular rehabilitation therapy, medications such as SSRIs and psychotherapy, including the most effectively represented cognitive behavioral therapy. Promising results were also found with Transcranial direct-current stimulation combined with vestibular rehabilitation with significant improvement in symptoms of patients over a sham group in an exploratory study. More recently, a study showed non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation to offer significant effect in PPPD patients regarding the quality of life, postural balance control, attack severity and depression level, with no reported serious side effects. The findings are argued to imply nVNS to be a safe and promising treatment option in patients with treatment- refractory PPPD and suggesting the need for further research. History Perhaps the first account of CSD was the German neurologist Karl Westphal's portrayal in the late 1800s of people who suffered dizziness, anxiety and spatial disorientation when shopping in town squares. This phenomenon was called \\"agoraphobia\\", meaning a fear of the marketplace. The term is now used to describe a psychological fear, but Westphal's original description included many symptoms of dizziness and imbalance not included in the modern psychiatric definition. Unlike people who feel anxious in crowds because they feel something bad will happen, people with CSD may dislike crowds because all the movement leads to a sensation of dizziness.

It infects cattle, bison, yak, reindeer, buffalo, moose, and sheep all over the world. It is most prevalent in Europe and Asia. Different species of Aedes mosquito can transmit the filarial worm. Stable fly Haematobia stimulans is the major vector. The mature roundworms are primarily present in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity, but are capable of migrating to central nervous system causing serious neurological disease. Description Setaria cervi shows sexual dimorphism as a typical roundworm. Males are relatively smaller measuring 50 mm long and 40 Œºm wide, while females are much larger measuring 100 mm long and 750 Œºm wide. Males can be distinguished from those of other species from showing horn-like lateral appendages and characteristic striated bands on the ventral side of the tail. The larvae (microfilariae) are very small and only about 200 Œºm long. The infective larvae are about 2 mm. Life cycle Setaria cervi is transmitted between mammals as definitive hosts and insects as intermediate hosts. Microfilariae are ingested by insect vector when they bite infected host. Once inside the gut of the insect, the larvae shed off their protective covering, a process called exsheathing. This generally take place within 90 minutes of initial ingestion. They penetrate the stomach wall and migrate to the body cavity, haemocoel. After 48 hours they move to fat bodies, where they undergo development by moulting. Second moulting follows after 11 days of infection. Soon after, the juveniles move back to haemocoel to become fully infective larvae. Then they move towards the proboscis from where they are readily released. Infective larvae are characterised by numerous projections called tubercles on the tail end. The infective larvae are injected into the mammalian host, where they undergo third moulting. By this the size of the body is greatly enlarged. Full maturation into reproductive adults require about a year. The average lifespan of an adult is 1.5 years. Pathogenicity Setaria cervi in the body cavity is generally harmless. But the young larvae upon infection can move to the nervous system, where they induce severe neurological disease, as well as in the eye, where they can cause eye damage resulting in blindness. Treatment Albendazole is very effective on the microfilariae. Hetrazan, tetramisole and levamisole are most commonly used.

Description  Noxon House has a brick exterior, hipped roof, square, symmetrical rectangular shape, paneled front door at center decorative windows and elements on either side over front door, five double hung sash windows across the second floor front and four on the first floor, four and four paired chimneys. It preserves a typical Georgian floor plan inside, with four over four and a center staircase ascending, another staircase descending behind it to the lower level and what was the original kitchen for the house. That kitchen still retains a beehive bread oven, large fireplace and original fittings, panels and beamed ceiling. Throughout, the Noxon House preserves its original wide plank floors, original windows and glass panes, many original moldings and doors, eight fireplaces with original surrounds and mantels and original timbers and beams.

Joseph Chretien bought the property in 1781 and his grandson, Hipolyte Chretien II, inherited the land from his father. The plantation was a 3000-acre cotton farm with over 500 slaves. Hippolyte Chretien started construction on the mansion in 1831, and the two story big house was completed in 1835, when Chretien moved in with his wife Felicit√©. During the Civil War, Hypolite, in bed with fever, was alerted that the Union soldiers were coming to burn down the plantation. Several of his neighbors were already decimated. He had the servants help him to the balcony and waved a white flag to parlay with the Union Commander. It turns out that both Hypolite and the Union Commander were Masons. Because of this, the plantation home was spared and only the slave quarters and outbuildings were burned.

Drenov√´ was noted as having a mixed population of Orthodox Albanians and Aromanians with the last elderly speaker of the local Slavic dialect passing away in the 2000s. Local Drenov√´ villagers stated that until the early 1960s, the village only spoke Bulgarian (Bullgar√ße) until the arrival of Aromanian settlers to the settlement which resulted in ethnic and linguistic change. Remaining Slavic speaking inhabitants assimilated while others moved away from the village. Some families from the Orthodox village of Cerje in Pustec municipality, speaking their local Slavic dialect have settled in Drenov√´. \\"V√´rnik eine v√∂llig homogene s√ºdslavische Bev√∂lkerung fast ohne albanische Mitbewohner gibt.

Damals sprach man don noch ausschlie√ülich Bulgarisch (bullgar√ße), und sie versuchte es deshalb ebenfalls zu lernen, hat es aber inzwischen wieder verlernt. Am Anfang der 60er Jahre kam eine gr√∂√üere Gruppe von aromunischen Siedlern nach Drenova und Boboshtica, und mit ihnen √§nderte sich die ethnische und sprachliche Struktur beider Orte grundlegend. Der Informant Thanas Thanasi, ein Aromune, best√§tigte ebenfalls, da√ü, als er in Drenova ankam, damals dort nur Bulgarisch (bullgar√ße) gesprochen wurde. Die fr√ºheren slavischen Einwohner sind aber inzwischen entweder assimiliert oder weggezogen.

As a Professor of Plant Pathology, he led the first department of Plant Pathology at an American university, and founded the Cornell Plant Pathology Herbarium (CUP). Personal Background and Education  H.H. Whetzel was born near Avilla, Indiana, where he spent his boyhood on the family farm. A nature lover and collector from an early age, he taught school for 2 years after graduating high school, then earned a bachelor's degree at Wabash College. After graduating from Wabash College in 1902, he attended graduate school at Cornell University, where he studied under the prominent mycologist George F. Atkinson. In 1904 he married Lucy E. Baker. They had two children, Joseph and Gertrude; Lucy died in 1912. In 1914 he married Lucy's sister Bertha A. Baker, and they raised the children together in Ithaca, New York.  Career  While still working on his doctoral research, Whetzel was hired by Liberty Hyde Bailey to do extension work for Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. In 1906, Whetzel was appointed assistant professor of botany, and in 1907, he became the head professor of the newly created Department of Plant Pathology. A quirk of Cornell's rules prevented him from officially receiving his PhD, but he was later awarded honorary D.Sc. degrees from Wabash College and the University of Puerto Rico. His students included M.F. Barrus and Charles Chupp, who both went on to teach at Cornell and who shared Whetzel's conviction of the importance of extension work as well as Carlos E. Chard√≥n, who became a government minister and Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. Whetzel studied sclerotium-producing cup fungi, and published a monograph of genera in the family Sclerotiniaceae. He was a charter member of the American Phytopathological Society, authored more than 300 publications, and was instrumental in founding and developing the Cornell Plant Pathology Herbarium (CUP)., where his fungus collections are stored. He was a pioneer in documenting the fungi of Puerto Rico (1916) and Bermuda (1920-1921). Whetzel died in Ithaca, New York at the age of 67.

The aircraft was carrying troops and equipment from an undisclosed location. All 49 people on board were killed. Attack 25th Airborne Brigade died in the shootdown, Kryvyi Rih The aircraft was carrying military equipment and 40 troops, as well as a crew of nine. It was coming in to land at Luhansk International Airport when it came under anti-aircraft fire. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, a heavy machine gun had been used to fire upon the aircraft. According to the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office, the aircraft was brought down by man-portable air-defense system equipment. It subsequently crashed at 00:51 local time (21:51 on 13 June, UTC); all 49 people on board died. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence blamed the pro-Russian separatists for the loss of the aircraft and troops. The aircraft was reported to have been carrying 40 paratroopers of the 25th Separate Dnipropetrovsk Airborne Brigade in addition to its crew. A military analyst based in Kyiv reported that two empty launch tubes for Igla missiles had been found near the Luhansk airport. Vladimir Inogorodsky, spokesman of the Donetsk People's Republic, confirmed that Igla missiles had been used. Separatists had said a week prior to the downing of the plane that they would not allow any more flights into the airport. The incident was the worst loss suffered by the Ukrainian military in a single event since the pro-Russian conflict began in February 2014. It was also the fourth deadliest involving the Il-76 and the tenth deadliest aircrash in Ukraine. According to a Russian source, on 17 June the head of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Valeriy Bolotov announced that investigators from the LPR were able to find neither armaments nor the body parts of soldiers at the crash site. Bolotov hypothesized that the plane was empty and was intended to transport the bodies of soldiers killed in action, while reaffirming that rebels had shot down the plane. On 7 October 2017 the Security Service of Ukraine claimed it had established the involvement of the Russian private military company Wagner Group in the downing of the Il-76.Hrytsak: SBU uncovers involvement of Russian ‚ÄòWagner PMC‚Äô in destroying Il-76 in Donbas, Debaltseve events, Kyiv Post (7 October 2017) On June 14, 2019, on the fifth anniversary of the shootdown of the aircraft, the Security Service of Ukraine reported that its investigators established direct involvement of Russian Federation Armed Forces lieutenant general Yevgeny Nikiforov, who ordered Dmitry Utkin from \\"Wagner Group\\" to destroy the aircraft. Aircraft The aircraft was an Ilyushin Il-76MD of the Ukrainian Air Force, registration 76777, manufacturer's serial number 0083482490. The aircraft had first flown in 1988. Originally operated by Aeroflot as CCCP-76777, the aircraft had subsequently served with the Ukrainian Air Force, Azov-Azia Aircompany and Avilond TAC as UR-76777 before serving with Payam Air as EP-TPY. A planned acquisition by the ATI Aircompany did not go ahead, and the aircraft was reacquired by the Ukrainian Air Force. Reactions Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko threatened separatists with an \\"adequate response\\" and declared 15 June a day of national mourning. In a televised emergency meeting, Poroshenko scolded the head of the country's SBU security service for \\"omissions\\" in protecting the aircraft. He called for \\"a detailed analysis of the reasons\\" for the failure and indicated that personnel changes may be instituted. The acting defense minister of Ukraine Mykhaylo Koval announced that the decision has been made to relieve the chief of staff of the Ukrainian military of his duties for the period of the investigation into the incident.

At its height, Imevisi√≥n programmed two national networks and additional local stations in Mexico City, Chihuahua, Ciudad Ju√°rez, Guadalajara, Mexicali, Tijuana and Monterrey. As the Mexican government moved toward privatization, and in light of financial sustainability issues, most of Imevisi√≥n was sold in 1992 to a group headed by Ricardo Salinas Pliego, which came to be known as Televisi√≥n Azteca. The government retained one of Imevisi√≥n's local stations, in Mexico City, and converted it into a cultural channel under the auspices of Conaculta. History =1972‚Äì83: The government gets into television= On March 15, 1972, the federal government expropriated the assets of Mexico City television station XHDF-TV, channel 13, as payment for debts the station held to state financier SOMEX. This marked the first direct entry of the Mexican state into the business of public television. In 1976, the government built new facilities for XHDF in Ajusco, south of Mexico City. In April 1972, the Mexican government embarked on another television project, the creation of Televisi√≥n Rural Mexicana (Mexican Rural Television). TRM was a new television system with low-power repeaters placed across Mexico, initially 80 and ultimately numbering 110 by 1976.Ver√≥nica Cuchillo Paulo, \\"Televisi√≥n y Valores: Un Estudio sobre los Valores Propuestos en la Serie Televisiva \\"El Chavo del Ocho\\" , thesis, 2006 TRM had received station allocations as early as 1969, for a batch of about 35 stations.DOF 8-6-69 In 1981, Televisi√≥n Rural Mexicana became Televisi√≥n de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana (Television of the Mexican Republic), and on April 15, 1982, TRM placed a television station on the air in Mexico City: XHTRM-TV, channel 22. XHTRM was the first UHF television station in the Mexico City area. On March 23, 1983, the Mexican government created three new federal corporations for mass media: IMER (Instituto Mexicano de la Radio) for radio, IMCINE (Film Institute of Mexico) for film, and the Instituto Mexicano de la Televisi√≥n (Mexican Television Institute, or IMT), for television. IMT combined the existing television assets of the state, including channels 13 and 22 and their associated repeater networks nationwide. XHTRM-TV changed call signs to XEIMT-TV to correspond with the new ownership. =1983‚Äì89: Building a competitor= IMT promptly set out to further expand its broadcasting holdings. In 1985, two important events in the history of the institute took place. IMT picked up the name Imevisi√≥n as its commercial identity, including a refined logo and branding.\\"Marco Hist√≥rico\\", Identidad gr√°fica para el canal televisivo de la Asociaci√≥n Tlaxcalteca de Televisi√≥n, Ram√≥n Ramos Meneses, 2004 That same year, on May 15, it signed on a new television station in Mexico City, XHIMT-TV channel 7. In order to give Mexico City an additional VHF channel, a frequency shuffle ensued between the Televisa channel 8 in Mexico City and two Televisa stations transmitting from Altzomoni, whose signals were targeted toward Puebla. As a result, the existing channel 8 in Mexico City, XHTM-TV, moved to channel 9 and became XEQ- TV. At the same time, XEX-TV channel 7 in Puebla relocated to channel 8, and XEQ-TV channel 9 in Puebla moved to channel 10 and took on the XHTM-TV callsign.Analysis of old concessions contained in the Registro P√∫blico de Concesiones of the IFT The old TRM repeater network, still linked to channel 22, was shifted to rebroadcast channel 7, whose programming was geared toward a working-class audience in contrast to that of channel 13.\\"Aimed at Working Class: Mexico To Get New TV Network\\", UPI (Los Angeles Times) 15 May 1987 Imevisi√≥n thus reached its zenith; it now controlled two national television networks, known as Red Nacional 13 (13 National Network, initially with 44 repeaters) and Red Nacional 7 ( 7 National Network, with 99 repeaters), as well as three local stations. *XHFN-TV, channel 8 in Monterrey; *XHSFJ-TV, canal 11 in Guadalajara; *XHJK-TV, canal 27 in Tijuana *XHAQ-TV, canal 5 in Mexicali *XHCH-TV, channel 2 in Chihuahua, and its satellite station, XHCJE- TV, channel 11 in Ciudad Ju√°rez (which signed on in 1980);\\"Frontera Norte: estructura de poder y medios de comunicaci√≥n\\", Estudios sobre las Culturas Contemporaneas IV.11 (March 1991): 131‚Äì68 *and XEIMT-TV, channel 22 in Mexico City. Each of these stations drew from Imevisi√≥n's programming but had many of their own local programs. XHFN, which in 1974 had taken to the air broadcasting secondary education telecourses, had a local newscast known as Telenoticias.Telenoticias opening, 1989 XHCH carried two local newscasts, one for the municipality and one with a regional aim. XEIMT was dedicated to movies and was known as Cine Canal 22. There were also local opt-outs on Imevisi√≥n stations in certain areas, often from producers owned by the state governments. Many of these, inherited from the TRM days, sowed the seeds for the eventual establishment of state-owned television networks in states such as Chiapas, Guanajuato and San Luis Potos√≠. While many were displaced after the privatization of Imevisi√≥n, a few remain active public TV channels. The Imevision network was the only national channel that remained on the air moments after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake interrupted broadcasts of Televisa, which has studios and offices in the capital. It was also the first to air live videos of the damages in the capital city and around the country. On a national level, Imevisi√≥n began building itself into a competitor to Televisa, who dominated Mexican television. Imevisi√≥n's newscasts were recognized as being more impartial than those of Televisa, and while total ratings share was very low, its programs attracted decent ratings (but had an uphill climb securing the same national advertisers as Televisa). When the Mexican Football Federation broke Televisa's decades-old monopoly on national soccer in 1990, Imevisi√≥n was the big winner, broadcasting several times more games than Televisa in the 1991‚Äì92 season.Andrew Paxman, \\"Mexico's Media Behemoth\\". Business Mexico 2.9 (Sep. 1992): 17. Additionally, Imevisi√≥n and Televisa competed in coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics, as well as covering the World Cup and Formula One racing.\\"Nace nuevo Sistema de Radiodifusi√≥n del Estado Mexicano. ¬øEs un nuevo Imevisi√≥n?\\", canal100.mx 5 July 2014 Imevisi√≥n had 5,000 employees. However, at the same time, embezzlement and inconsistent management dogged Imevisi√≥n. In September 1990, Imevisi√≥n consolidated its national networks into one, with Mexico City channels 7 and 22 relaying channel 13, in an attempt to mount a stronger challenge to Televisa. The National Network 13's affiliates and retransmitter channels grew when the National Network 7 channels were merged with its local stations at the same time. =1989‚Äì93: Dismantling and privatization= In December 1990, the government announced its plan to split off channels 7 and 22 from the Imevisi√≥n system and keep only channel 13; as such, channels 7 and 22 began to simulcast XHDF directly. This sparked concern among actors in Mexico's cultural sphere, who wanted to see one of the stations reserved to become a station centered around cultural programming. On January 26, 1991, they wrote a letter to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, asking that one of the stations be reserved for a new cultural television entity. Salinas responded the next month, agreeing with their proposal. Channel 22 was chosen for this project, and it went off the air late in 1991. On June 23, 1993, XEIMT returned to the air from a more powerful transmitter located on Cerro del Chiquihuite, under the auspices of Conaculta and with its new cultural format. In 1991, the first auction was held in an attempt to privatize the remainder of Imevisi√≥n; meeting with few bidders, the auction was declared void. In order to sell most of the Imevisi√≥n stations, a legal hurdle had to be resolved. Many of the stations, especially those that relayed XHIMT, operated under non-commercial licenses, known as permits (permisos) in Mexican parlance. These had to be converted into commercial licenses, or concessions, to allow their sale, with the concessionaires being a series of state-owned businesses, the largest of which was called Televisi√≥n Azteca. Eventually, two national networks were put on the auction block: a network headed by XHDF, with 90 repeaters, and a network led by XHIMT, with 78. The latter network was sold in regional blocks. In addition, separate transmissions were intermittently mounted for XHIMT, breaking from XHDF. Four proposals were received for the auction. On July 18, 1993, the winner was announced: Radio Televisi√≥n del Centro, a group headed by Ricardo Salinas Pliego, owner of the Elektra electronics chain. The final bid came in at US$650 million ($ in dollars), and the networks adopted the Televisi√≥n Azteca name. Channels 7 and 13 had adopted the Televisi√≥n Azteca name in April, before the sale.

The Division 1 premiership was won by the Port Melbourne Football Club, after it defeated Preston in the Grand Final on 20 September by 113 points; it was Port Melbourne's 14th Division 1 premiership, the second of three premierships won in a row between 1980 and 1982, and the fifth of six premierships won in nine seasons from 1974 until 1982. The Division 2 premiership was won by Camberwell; it was the club's second Division 2 premiership, and it was the last premiership ever won by the club. Rule changes After trialling it during the 1980 finals series, two field umpires were used during all Division 1 matches in 1981. Division 2 continued to be officiated by a single field umpire during the home-and-away season, and by two field umpires during finals. One consequence of this was that the Liston Trophy voting procedure changed. Previously, in both the Liston Trophy and Field Medal, the field umpire and each of the two goal umpires had independently awarded votes to the best two players on the ground on a 2‚Äì1 basis. This year in Division 1, each field umpire but neither of the goal umpires awarded Liston Trophy votes on the same 2‚Äì1 basis as before; in Division 2, Field Medal voting procedures were unchanged. Division 1 The Division 1 home-and-away season was played over 18 rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. The finals were played at the Junction Oval. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the season was Rex Hunt (Sandringham), who kicked 95 goals during the home-and-away season and 110 goals overall. *The J. J. Liston Trophy was won by Vic Aanensen (Port Melbourne), who polled 24 votes; it was Aanensen's second Liston Trophy in three seasons. Aanensen finished ahead of Tony West (Brunswick), who polled 23 votes, and Brian Jones (Frankston), who polled 17 votes. *Dandenong won the seconds premiership. Dandenong 16.16 (112) defeated Port Melbourne 15.14 (104) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain- raiser to the seniors Grand Final on 20 September. Division 2 The Division 2 home-and-away season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system; all finals were played on Sundays at Toorak Park. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the Division 2 was Peter Stevenson (Camberwell), who kicked 106 goals in the home-and-away season and 119 goals overall. *The J. Field Medal was won by Brian Matthey (Oakleigh), who polled 36 votes. Matthey finished ahead of Neil Peart (Northcote), who polled 33 votes, and Adrian McClure (Waverley), who polled 29 votes. *Camberwell won the Seconds premiership. Camberwell 18.12 (120) defeated Oakleigh 17.14 (116) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior Grand Final on 6 September. Notable events =Interleague matches= For the first time, the Association named separate representative teams for Division 1 and Division 2. The Division 1 team played a match against the Greater Northern Football League, which was a short-lived amalgamation between the Launceston-based Northern Tasmanian Football Association and the north-west coastal North Western Football Union. Division 2 played against the South Australian Football Association, a second- tier senior competition which had been formed in Adelaide in 1978. =Other notable events= *Former Frankston president Alan Wickes became president of the Association at the annual general meeting in March 1981, challenging and defeating Cr Alex Gillon by a majority of 26‚Äì15. Gillon had served as president of the Association for 27 years since his election in 1954, and it was the first time since his election that anybody had opposed him for the office. Wickes, like Gillon, was determined to prevent the Victorian Football League from playing football on Sundays in Victoria, but said he believed the Association had not done enough in recent years under Gillon to justify the state government's continuing support on the matter. *On 5 April, the first round of Division 2 matches for the season, Waverley 52.31 (343) defeated Sunshine 8.5 (53). Waverley's score set a new record for the highest score in Association history, breaking the previous record of 43.29 (287) set by Port Melbourne in 1941. Waverley full-forward Paul Angelis kicked 23 goals in the match, the highest by any player since George Gough (Northcote) kicked 25 goals in a match in 1924. *Geelong West's financial position deteriorated dramatically in the lead-up to the 1981 season, and early in the year a number of high-profile senior players ‚Äì including full-forward Joe Radojevic and former Association representative players Tony Gilmore, Ivan Russell and Seve Woolfe ‚Äì went on strike seeking payments owed from 1980. The club was able to get itself out of immediate financial hardship and end the strike during the year. *On 12 May, Caulfield rover Mark Crocker was suspended until the start of the 1983 season for spitting in field umpire Ray Groom's face. Crocker maintained that he had not spit at Groom, and merely made a noise with his lips; he was still appealing the suspension as late as the beginning of the 1982 season, but the full suspension was upheld. *On 21 June, Fred Cook (Port Melbourne) kicked his 934th career senior Association goal, passing Bob Bonnett (Port Melbourne, 933 goals) to become the leading goalkicker in Association history. Cook still holds this title as of 2018. The record- breaking goal was witnessed by 12,000 fans, the Association's highest home- and-away crowd since the mid 1970s. *In a high-scoring and remarkable Division 1 preliminary final, Preston 28.7 (175) defeated Sandringham 26.12 (168). Preston had led the game by 65 points after twelve minutes of the third quarter, but Sandringham fought back from this huge deficit ‚Äì helped in large part by Rex Hunt, who kicked seven goals in the final quarter ‚Äì and took the lead late in the final quarter, before Preston steadied to win by seven points. Preston was helped by its goal-kicking accuracy, kicking 13.0 after half time. Sandringham's score is one of the highest losing scores, in a final or otherwise, in top level senior football. *Despite leading by only five points at half-time, Port Melbourne recorded the highest ever score and winning margin in a Division 1 Grand Final, 32.19 (211) and 113 points respectively.

Early life and career Mamikins was born in Leningrad then in the Russian SFSR, and moved to Riga, Latvian SSR with his parents shortly after birth. Prior to his election, Mamikins was a journalist working for several Latvian Russian-language newspapers, radio stations and television channels. He presented programs on Viasat's TV5 Latvia and on REN TV's Baltic Channel. He studied Russian language and literature and is a graduate of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Latvia. In 2010 he completed a master's degree in philology from the same institution. Member of the European Parliament Mamikins was elected to the European Parliament at the 2014 European Parliament election for the Harmony party. Although he was placed 4th on the Harmony list (Boris Tsilevitch was placed 1st), he was preferenced first on the list by Latvian voters and took the party's single seat in the Parliament. He sits with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group. Mamikins worked on the delegation for relations with Belarus, as well as a substitute member on the delegation for relations with EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia. He has since been a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In this capacity, he served as the parliament‚Äôs rapporteur on the Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia. In December 2017, according to the ranking website MEPRanking.eu, Mamikins was ranked as the 4th most effective Latvian MEP (out of 8) and 365th most effective member of the European Parliament (out of 751). In 2018 Mamikins left the Harmony party after disagreements with Nils U≈°akovs and joined the Latvian Russian Union. He was nominated as that party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2018 national election. In 2020 Mamikins, alongside his party members Tatjana ≈Ωdanoka and Miroslav Mitrofanov, was included in the European Platform for Democratic Elections database of \\"biased observers\\" for backing disputed and rigged elections in Russia and occupied Ukraine Controversy In mid-2014 Mamikins filed his declaration of financial interests in the European Parliament in Russian, which was promptly refused on the grounds that Russian is not an official language of the European Union. Mamikins publicized the incident on social media, making waves in Latvian Russian community. In November 2016 the Baltic Centre for Investigative Journalism Re:Baltica reported that Mamikins and another Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule were circumventing the 2014 ban of hiring close relatives as assistants, with Mamikins employing Grigule's daughter Anete and Grigule employing Mamikins' wife Natalija. All four of them declined to comment, whether it was as a result of a mutual agreement. In December 2016 Mamikins met with President of Syria Bashar al-Assad and parliamentary speaker Hadiey Abbas and visited a Russian airbase at Hyeymim alongside with five other MEPs and representatives of Russian Federation's Federal Council of the Federal Assembly. The visit was condemned by Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs and Security Police head Normunds Me≈æviets.

Seutula is also a village in the medieval town of Helsinki, stretching to Rajakoski in the north, Lavanko in the east covering the whole district of Kiila, and including Sotilaskorpi in the south. On the other hand, the western part of the river's curve, including the K√∂nigstedt Manor, belongs to the village of Riipil√§. Seutula is often considered a region stretching even outside the official district, and it has an active local community. In terms of government, Seutula, Riipil√§, and Kiila belong to the Kivist√∂ major district. The Seutula school. The Katriina Hospital in Seutula. In the early 1950s, a new airfield for Helsinki was built along the Seutulantie road, stretching from Tuusulantie in Ruskeasanta to Seutula. This airfield was opened in 1952, and became the Helsinki Airport in 1977. Already during its construction, the airfield was commonly called the Seutula airfield, because Tuusulantie had a sign pointing to Seutula. In reality, the airfield was built about 8 kilometres southeast from Seutula, in the northern parts of Veromiehenkyl√§ and Kirkonkyl√§. Nowadays, Lentokentt√§ (Finnish for \\"airfield\\") is its own district in Vantaa. The name Seutula is often connected to prisons, although there never has been a prison in Seutula. The reason for the connection is that the airfield was mainly built using prisoner labour. Some of the prisoners used to build the airfield were public figures of the 1960s, convicted of driving under influence, bringing the activity to light. An open prison was located in Seutula until 2009.http://www.rikosseuraamus.fi/16870.htm This prison was originally called a labour colony, and one of its inmates in the 1960s was Irwin Goodman,Vantaan Sanomat who had made records about the subject called Terveisi√§ Seutulasta (\\"greetings from Seutula\\") and Autolla Kanarian saarille (\\"to the Canary Islands by car\\"), with lyrics by Vexi Salmi.

Personal life  Henry was the third of five children. His parents are Ghanaian by birth. As a child, he often had to get clothes from the charity Barnardo's. During his childhood, his siblings were often involved with the police, with one going to prison for grievous bodily harm. When he was 17, Henry was accepted into the Central School of Ballet and worked for a builder while also learning opera. Henry moved to London when he attended the Central School of Ballet, but later moved to Inverness, Scotland.  Career  Outside of ballet, Henry started doing stunt work which included work on The Bill. Henry later realized that he \\"wasn't a very good stunt man\\" and later changed perform for five years in Starlight Express in the West End of London. During a performance of Carmen Jones with The Old Vic, professional opera singers encouraged Henry to focus on opera because \\"he had a voice to die for\\". He later appeared in Madama Butterfly at the Royal Albert Hall and at the Covent Garden restaurant Sarastro. While at Sarastro, producers from Warner Music UK signed him for their label. They also encouraged Henry to perform opera combined with hip hop. He was compared as a combination of Luciano Pavarotti and Puff Daddy. =Football= Henry has also performed before association football matches. In 2003 he performed \\"Abide with Me\\" before the 2003 FA Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium. Arsenal fans were impressed with his performance and nicknamed him the \\"Voice of Arsenal\\". In 2007, Henry sang the Croatian national anthem, \\"Lijepa na≈°a domovino\\" before Croatia's match against the England national football team at Wembley Stadium. During the performance, Henry made a mistake with the lyrics. Henry was supposed to sing \\"Mila kuda si planina\\" (\\"My dear, how we love your mountains\\"), instead he sang \\"Mila kura si planina\\" (\\"My dear, my penis is a mountain\\"). Henry apologized for the mistake, however Croatian fans considered him a lucky omen as they felt that his mistake helped the players relax as they were seen laughing after it. They also petitioned the Croatian Football Federation to hire Henry as an official mascot and for him to sing at their games at UEFA Euro 2008.  Album  In 2003, Henry released the album Modern Arias. Sales of the album were slow at first, but by 2006, it reached #37 in the Belgian Albums Chart.

Born in Sheffield, Thompson was already an England schoolboy international when he joined Sheffield United on amateur terms in March 1939. Employed as a member of the ground staff, Thompson was sent to play for two of United's feeder clubs, Woodbourne Alliance and Fulwood. With league football suspended during World War II, Thompson became a regular player for the club's reserve team before making his first-team debut in 1941 (playing in the unofficial wartime league), becoming the club's youngest ever player to that point, being only 16 years and 103 days old. Thompson enlisted not long after making his debut and served with the Durham Light Infantry, but continued to make occasional appearances for United when not on active duty, as well as making guest appearances for Rotherham United, Lincoln City and Crystal Palace. Wounded while on active duty in Germany in 1945, Thompson remained in the army after the end of the conflict, but was allowed to resume his career with Sheffield United on a part-time basis, and made his Football League debut during the 1946‚Äì47 season. Having been demobbed in 1947, Thompson finally became a full-time professional and played regularly for United for the next few seasons. Considered to have a good amount of pace and skill, Thompson was not popular with sections of the united support who believed he lacked commitment and aggression and he was regularly barracked during games which led to Thompson asking for a transfer in 1949.

Biography  Born into a Jewish family he studied art history at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and then, in 1906, at the Humboldt University of Berlin where he was taught by Heinrich W√∂lfflin and Wilhelm Worringer. Westheim published monographs on Oskar Kokoschka, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, and Mexican sculpture. His German citizenship was stripped from him in 1935. He moved to Paris the same year. Despite his exile status, Westheim was considered an enemy alien in France at the beginning of the war and was interned. Shunted from camp to camp (five in all) he later referred to this as his \\"Tour de France.\\" As France fell to the Germans, he escaped his internment camp in 1941, fleeing France through the ERC (Emergency Rescue Committee). From Marseille he moved to Spain, Portugal and ultimately Mexico, where he married Mariana Frenk, who assisted him.  Paul Westheim's Art Collection  Before the rise of Hitler, Paul Westheim had gathered an important art collection of German Expressionists. In 2013 the heirs of Paul Westheim filed suit against the heirs of Charlotte Weidler for the return of paintings from the collection, which had been entrusted to Weidler for safekeeping during Westheim's flight. Weidler told Westheim the artworks had been destroyed; however she began selling them as her own after his death The matter was resolved in 2019 after the death of Weidler, with Yris Solomon, the executor of Charlotte Weidler‚Äôs estate, successfully defending the case. The court supported the claim that Marianna Frenk had relinquished all claims to the artworks in Westheim‚Äôs collection.

Combinations of red and blue lights and monochromatic light of wavelength smaller than blue produce a similar effect for the human eye due to a second resonancy of the red-sensitive cone cells. Composed-light violet shows two colors when decomposed. Violet light from the rainbow, which can be referred as spectral violet, is composed only by a short wavelength instead. This monochromatic violet light occupies its own place at the end of the visible spectrum, and is one of the seven spectral colors described by Isaac Newton in 1672. Violet light is at the higher end of the visible spectrum, with a wavelength ~380-450 nanometers (in experiments, people have so far seen to 310 nm). Light with a shorter wavelength than violet but longer than X-rays and gamma rays is called ultraviolet. Violet objects are normally composed-light violet. Objects reflecting spectral violet appear very dark, because human vision is relatively insensitive to those wavelengths. Monochromatic lamps emitting spectral-violet wavelengths can be roughly approximated by the color named electric violet, which is a composed-light violet producing a similar effect to the human eye.

Early settlements on Arrowsic Island The first major settlement on Arrowsic Island, located east of the Kennebec River and west of the Sasanoa River in what is now southern Maine, was established by Major Thomas Clarke and Captain Thomas Lake in the 1650s. Located in the north of the island on the banks of the Sasanoa, Clarke and Lake operated an extensive business and a small community, engaging in fishing, lumbering, the raising of cattle, and trade with the local Native Americans. On August 14, 1676, during King Philip's War, the Clarke and Lake settlement was attacked and destroyed by a band of Native Americans. The evening before, an Indian woman appeared at the door of the Clarke and Lake fort seeking shelter. She was admitted, and in the dead of night quietly opened the gate. In rushed warriors, and in the massacre which followed, 30 colonists were either killed and scalped or taken into captivity. Captain Thomas Lake, Sylvanus Davis and two others seized a canoe and paddled to Parker's Island (now Georgetown), where all but Lake escaped alive from their pursuers. As the warehouse was looted and village burned to ashes, a brave sported the captain's hat.Rev. Henry O.

But King William's War broke out in May 1689, and by July, Newtown was destroyed and abandoned.Brief Description and History of Arrowsic, Maine  Construction of Fort Menaskoux  Signed in 1713, the Treaty of Portsmouth brought a truce between the Eastern (Abenaki) Indians and English settlements. Newtown was reestablished in 1714, then incorporated in 1716 as Georgetown-on-Arrowsic, named after King George I. Eventually, the town's boundaries were extended to include Parker's Island, Stage Island and the Plantation of Nequasset (present-day Georgetown, Phippsburg, Bath, West Bath and Woolwich). During this time Fort Menaskoux was built and Samuel Penhallow was the commander. Beginning on August 9, 1717, Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute and Panhallow conducted a two-day conference on Arrowsic with delegates of various tribes, who arrived in a flotilla of canoes and encamped on Lee Island opposite the town. They objected to so many English forts in their territory, and Shute responded that he would build them wherever he thought necessary. Incidentally, the governor's boat Squirrel ran aground on what has been known since as Squirrel Point. All the Indians helped him get free.A History of Georgetown Island, Maine There was also a conference held with the Eastern Indians at the fort on August 11, 1718.https://archive.org/stream/collectionshist00moorgoog#page/n64/mode/2up = Raids in Dummer's War = In the summer of 1723 during Dummer's War, Arrowsic was attacked by the Norridgewocks and their 250 Indian allies from Canada during the Northeast Coast Campaign. Incited by French missionary Sebastien Rale, they burned 37 dwellings and killed 300 cattle. The 40 inhabitants fled to the garrison, with only a child lost. When the fort could not be taken, the Indians disappeared upriver. The village was attacked again in 1724. = 1758 raid = During the French and Indian War, on June 9, 1758,a band of Natives shot Ebenezer Preble and a workman as they tended his farm on the northern end of the island. They then attacked his garrison, killing his wife and carrying away their 5 children to be sold as servants in Canada. It would be the last Indian attack on the Kennebec River; next year brought the Fall of Quebec.

He was one of those present in the first seizure of the Liberty Arsenal in 1855 and was the leader of the second seizure of the arsenal in 1861 during the American Civil War. For this and other acts he was captured, tried by a military court, sentenced to hang, but spared by Abraham Lincoln. Biography =Early life= Henry Routt was born in Woodford County, Kentucky. His grave monument and an obituary imply that he was born in 1817 or 1818, although other sources give his date of birth as April 22, 1824.The United States Biographical Dictionary and Portrait Gallery of Eminent and Self-Made Men, abstract =Pre-war business= Henry was an attorney in Liberty Missouri. He is described as standing 6 ft 2.5 inches and having wavy, dark red hair.Dr. Robinson, Kearney Courier, April 13, 2011 =Mexican War= Routt served as adjutant to Lt. Col. William Gilpin the Santa Fe Trace Battalion of Missouri volunteers during the Mexican War. This unit was formed to keep the Santa Fe trail open. Becoming ill during the campaign, Routt was left with the garrison at Fort Mann (Kansas Territory). When friendly Pawnees approached and entered the Fort, Routt ordered them arrested until the commander returned. When they attempted to flee, nine were killed.Sante Fe Trail Research page about Fort Mann =Arsenal seizures= Routt was a participant in the first Liberty Arsenal raid in 1855, when Missouri border ruffians seized weapons from the arsenal to use against Lawrence, Kansas during the \\"Wakarusa War\\". The matter was resolved shortly thereafter and most of the weapons were returned to Federal authorities. He agitated heavily against opponents to slavery. This included an attack with a revolver and Bowie knife on a Union man because the man would not sell his military outfit goods on credit.Dr. Robinson, Kearney Courier, April 20, 2011 On April 20, 1861 he led approximately 200 men in yet another seizure of the Liberty arsenal. This time the arms were not returned and were instead used to arm secessionist militia and later Missouri State Guard. =Battle of Lexington= Prior to the Siege of Lexington, before Col. James A. Mulligan arrived and when only a few companies of Home Guard were present, Routt acting as a colonel with around 800 recruits arrived in the vicinity and arrested several prominent Unionists including former Missouri Governor Austin A. King. Routt's force swelled to around 1200 and he demanded the Home Guard's surrender, but they refused. When it was learned that Union cavalry had been dispatched to relieve the post, Routt withdrew and eventually linked with Sterling Price. Routt's recruits were absorbed into other units and he returned home in autumn of 1861.Sterling Price's Lieutenants, p. 230 =Capture, trial, and pardon= Routt was arrested March 17, 1862 and tried by a military tribunal for treason and inciting rebellion. He was found guilty of the charges and sentenced to death by hanging.

It is one of several new religious movements in Korea referred to as Guwompa (Salvation sect).  History  The first Good News church was first established in 1972 by Ock Soo Park and became a mission when the missionary school was established in 1976. In the early years, Park conducted vocation Bible schools for the youth in the nearby villages, served as a spiritual counselor at Suwon Prison, and went on witness trips to leper colonies. In the early 1990s, the mission sent its first missionaries to Germany and the United States. Missionaries sent to Kenya in the mid 1990s faced problems with religious registration as foreign groups were denied such registration unless sponsored by a native Kenyan church. Eventually, religious registration was granted to them. In the early 2000s, missionaries were dispatched to South Africa, Brazil, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. According to the church webpage, it currently has 170 churches in South Korea and 838 international churches.  Activities  The organization's activities include religious seminars and missionary activities in different countries. It also organizes youth events, and broadcasts sermons over the radio and the internet.  Controversy  In 2011, 400 volunteer English teachers, including a number of young college students, were led to believe that they were recruited to teach English in Mexico. The preparatory meeting, called \\"English Camp\\", included religious lectures on the topic of sin, which took place in ballrooms guarded by security personnel that discouraged members from leaving. Participants who were considered \\"tardy\\" were subjected to physical punishment such as being made to do squat-thrust exercises. One of the college students attending the event said, \\"I was the victim of a scam.\\" The organisation's activities in Nagaland, India, as well as in Uganda where religious material from the Good News Mission has been used in public schools, have also been questioned.

He did not attain this goal but collected more than 40 definitions, and within these various concepts identified four elementary strands of creativity.Tudor Rickards: Creativity and the management of change. Blackwell publishers 1999. p. 31-2 This idea was later elaborated in a seminal article \\"An analysis of creativity\\" which ever since has been credited as the basis for bringing conceptual clarity and structure into creativity, and was regarded as a viable way to look at creativity and to identify momentous approaches for further research in the field. =Research and theory= Rhodes theory asserts that creativity is not merely an elusive and fuzzy capacity with no predictable structure, but exhibits a clear-cut composition of four essential components and dominant factors which have an impact to any kind of result, solution or idea. In his epoch-making article Rhodes wrote 1961: > About five years ago I set out to find a definition of the word creativity. > I was interested in imagination, originality, and ingenuity. In time I had > collected forty definitions of creativity and sixteen of imagination. But as > I inspected my collection I observed that the definitions are not mutually > exclusive.

Blackwell publishers 1999. p. 31-2 since it not only endowed a seemingly unstructured field with a structure, but delivered a classification system and within it four precise starting-points for classified research about creativity. =4 Ps of creativity= Rhodes defined four separate strands which have influence on the occurrence of creativity and which represent the essential cornerstones for any kind of creativity research: Person, Process, Press and Product:Mel Rhodes: An Analysis of Creativity. in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42, No. 7, p. 307‚Äì309 * \\"The term person, as used here, covers information about personality, intellect, temperament, physique, traits, habits, attitudes, self-concept, value systems, defense mechanisms, and behaviour.\\" (p. 307). * \\"The term process applies to motivation, perception, learning, thinking, and communication.\\" (p. 308). * \\"The term press refers to the relationship between human beings and their environment.\\" (p. 308). This notion and the word \\"press\\" are rather common in the field of education. * \\"The term product refers to a thought which has been communicated to other people in the form of words, paint, clay, metal, stone, fabric, or other material. When an idea becomes embodied into tangible form it is called a product.\\" (p. 309). =Criticism= The concept itself was copied numerous times, sometimes one-to-one, sometimes simply by replacing one term (e.g.: \\"place\\" instead of \\"press\\"), many a time without crediting the original author. Some followers also tried to add a fifth or sixth term which starts with a \\"P\\" (e.g.: \\"place\\", \\"problem\\", \\"preference\\", \\"phantasy\\", \\"persuasion\\", \\"passion\\", \\"power\\" or else). On closer inspection it appears that all terms added so far are already included within the original framework, thus are not to be embodied separately in the concept on an equal footing; in details: \\"Place\\" is a part of \\"press\\", \\"problem\\" is as a starting point a vital part of the \\"process\\", \\"preference\\" and \\"power\\" are linked to \\"persons\\", and \\"phantasy\\", \\"persuasion\\", \\"passion\\" are traits and capacities of \\"persons\\" too. Hence the original lean concept shall be still deemed to be valid as the essential structure giving map and as \\"a system that enables researchers to study smaller manageable components of the complex concept of creativity\\".Gerard Puccio: Two dimensions of creativity This does deliver a sound basis both for researcher and practitioner in the field, to align creativity research endeavours in a comprehensive and comprehensible way by pooling the problems and objects of research.Exceptional children research review.

He created extensive and high value compositional paintings, portraits, landscapes, graphics, thematic compositions, book designs.

During the Great Patriotic War he depicted the heroic image of Soviet people (\\"Battle for a city\\", 1942, \\"Tanya\\", 1946), national liberation struggle of the Armenian people (\\"David Beck\\", 1945). Eduard Isabekyan was the founder of thematic compositional genre in Armenia. The basis of his art is the history of Armenian nation and its future, its proud posture and the ecstatic potential. Isabekyan‚Äôs works of thematic compositional genre are the achievement of Armenian fine art of the Soviet period. \\"Young David\\" (1956, The National Gallery of Armenia), \\"The Revolt of Haghpat Peasants in 1903\\" (1957), \\"Reply to Hazkert\\" (1960, The National Gallery of Armenia) and other paintings distinguish by their monumental expressiveness, dynamic composition and civic resonance.

One of the best examples of Armenian portraiture of Soviet period is the \\"Mother‚Äôs portrait\\" painting (1944). The thematic center of his landscapes is the epic description of Armenian nature, ancient fortresses and temples: \\"In the Canyon of Tatev\\" (1959), \\"The Oxen Crossing the River by the Bridge\\" (1959), \\"Khndzoresk\\" (1962). Many paintings are distinguished by artistic saturation: \\"Horovel\\" (1956, The National Gallery of Armenia), \\"Near the well\\" (\\"They didn‚Äôt come back\\", 1965), vIn the shade of the treesv (1966), \\"Artavazd‚Äôs death\\" (1966). The illustrations of Derenik Demirchian‚Äôs \\"Vardananq\\" and Sero Khanzadyan‚Äôs \\"Mkhitar Sparapet\\" novels are also commonly known. Isabekyan is the author of a number of drawings and the series of graphics devoted to painter Arpenik Nalbandyan.

History  FaithLife Financial is a Fraternal Benefit Society and was founded in 1972, as Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada. The Society was sponsored by two competing American fraternal societies: Aid Association for Lutherans and Lutheran Brotherhood both of which had been operating in Canada since the late 1920s. The Canadian government granted Letters Patent (petition signing shown above) on June 28, 1972, to formally create Lutheran Life Insurance Society (the \\"Society\\"). On July 21, 1972, the Board of Directors enacted Bylaw Number One which regulates the operation of Lutheran Life. The Society began operations on January 2, 1973 from its Head Office on the 12th floor of the Marsland Centre in Waterloo, Ontario. On December 31, 1972, Aid Association for Lutherans and Lutheran Brotherhood withdrew from Canada. They provided $26.4 million in Canadian assets and more than $167 million of in force life insurance. In August 1989 Society staff moved into the newly constructed head office located at 470 Weber Street N. Waterloo, Ontario. The Society opened Membership to the broader Christian community in July 2004. To reflect its growing Christian membership, it adopted the trade name FaithLife Financial in March, 2005. In December 2008, FaithLife Financial was officially adopted as the legal name.  Operations  FaithLife Financial is licensed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.

The connector is circular in shape, with a flattened top edge and originally specified for charging battery electric vehicles at 3‚Äì50 kilowatts, with a plug modified by Tesla capable of outputting 150 kilowatts. Electric power is provided as single-phase or three- phase alternating current (AC), or direct current (DC). In January 2013, the IEC 62196 Type 2 connector was selected by the European Commission as official charging plug within the European Union. It has since been adopted as the recommended connector in some countries outside of Europe, including New Zealand. Released under the name SAE J3068 is three-phase AC connector for North America‚Äîwith Local Interconnect Network (LIN) for control signaling based on IEC 61851-1 Edition 3 Annex D. The Guobiao standard GB/T 20234.2-2015 for AC-charging within the People's Republic of China specifies cables with Type 2-style male connectors on both ends, and a female inlet on vehicles‚Äîthe opposite gender to the rest of the world, and with different control signalling. Description Cars are fitted with a standardised male vehicle inlet, whilst charging station are fitted with a female outlet, either directly on the outside of the charging station, or via a flexible cable with permanently attached connector on the end. A charging station with a permanently fixed cable can be attached directly into the vehicle inlet, similar to using a petrol pump and when no fixed cable is available, a separate male-to-female cable is used to hook up the vehicle either using the charging station, or from a traditional IEC 60309-2 industrial connector. The Type 2 connector system was originally proposed by Mennekes in 2009 leading to the colloquial name of Mennekes. The system was later tested and standardised by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) as VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2, and subsequently recommended by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in 2011. , Type 2 is intended to replace the previous vehicle connectors used for AC charging within the European electric vehicle network, displacing both SAE J1772 and EV Plug Alliance Types 3A and 3C. For DC charging, the Combo 2 socket (Type 2 supplemented with 2 DC pins) shall become standard in cars, replacing Type 4 CHAdeMO. The transition period is scheduled to last until 2020. The IEC 62196 Type 2 connector is used in a slightly modified form at all European Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, and the European Tesla Supercharger network. As of 2017 Tesla is the only automaker which offers based on the IEC 62196-2 specification the charging with alternating current and direct current. For charging with direct current the specification IEC 62196-3 Combined Charging System (CCS) is favored in Europe. Pins The connectors contain seven contact places: two small and five larger. The top row consists of two small contacts for signalling, the middle row contains three pins, the centre pin is used for Earthing, while the outer two pins used for the power supply, optionally in conjunction with the two pins on the bottom row which are also for power supply. Three pins are always used for the same purposes: * Proximity pilot (PP): pre-insertion signalling * Control pilot (CP): post-insertion signalling * Protective earth (PE): full-current protective earthing system‚Äî diameter The allocation of the four normal power supply pins vary depending on the mode of operation. They are allocated as one of: * Neutral (N) and (L1): single-phase AC * Neutral (N) and phases (L1, L2, and L3): three-phase AC * Neutral (N) and (L1); negative (‚àí), and positive (+): combined single-phase AC and low-current DC * Negative (‚àí) and positive (+): low-current DC * Negative (‚àí, ‚àí) and positive (+, +): mid-current DC Communication takes place over the signalling pins between the charger, cable, and vehicle to ensure that the highest common denominator of voltage and current is selected. DC charging Some vehicle inlets may contain the extra connections to allow the Combo Coupler DC-only charger to be inserted.

Her competence projected an image of black midwives as the face of an internationally esteemed medical profession, while working within the context of deep social and economic inequality in health care provided to African Americans. Her life story and work exist in the context of Southern granny midwives who served birthing women outside of hospitals. Biography Coley was born Mary Francis Hill in Baker County, Georgia. She was the youngest of four children, a sole-surviving twin at birth. She was raised by relatives after her parents died. She received almost nothing in the way of formal education, leaving after third grade but relied instead on practical training and apprenticeship. In 1930, she married Ashley Coley, a carpenter, and moved with him to Albany, Georgia. He abandoned the family with ten children, and she turned to practical nursing and midwifery under the tutelage of Onnie Lee Logan. Coley was a particular type of lay midwife, often referred to as a \\"granny-midwife,\\" one who was called to the profession spiritually and who apprenticed under an older midwife.Bonaparte, A. D. (2007). The persecution and prosecution of granny midwives in South Carolina, 1900-1940 (Doctoral dissertation, Vanderbilt University). Coley developed a busy practice, serving over half the families in the area and charging double the fees of other midwives ($30). Her business afforded her a home, a car, a telephone, an assistant, and a surplus of ready supplies for emergencies. She knew that many families had to save up to pay her, and she knew which families could afford more or less than others. She would also accept payment in kind in some circumstances. Home visits by nurses such as this one were a critical service funded by the Children's Bureau's Maternity and Infancy program, 1921‚Äì1929. (National Library of Medicine) Coley pursued a career in midwifery at a time of increased scrutiny and regulation (Sheppard-Towner Act or the Promotion of the Welfare and Hygiene of Maternity and Infancy Act of 1921) and during an era when public resources were invested in the expansion of hospitals and obstetric care (Hill-Burton Act of 1946) rather than the midwifery model of care. Although increased surveillance of midwifery practice cut in half the number of midwives between 1930-50 (dropping from 3000 to 1,322), Coley went on to provide a range of birth and family services across Georgia for more than three decades. As an African American, she advocated for the health of Georgia's black population and was known for her willingness to work with women regardless of race in a time of segregation. It is estimated that she delivered over 3,000 babies in her career, and she offered additional services to families such as assistance in cooking, cleaning, child-minding, laundering, and helping new parents file official forms and birth certificates. She was known affectionately by her patients as \\"Miss Mary\\". Coley served as President of the Women's Auxiliary in the Church of the Kingdom of God, and taught Sunday school classes. She died in Albany in March 1966 after a career of over 30 years as a midwife. All My Babies midwives directed by George C. Stoney. In 1952 documentary filmmaker George C. Stoney was recruited by the Georgia Health Department to produce an instructional film for midwives in training. Following a criteria-based selection process, Stoney and Dr. Mason (a local black physician) interviewed more than 20 Georgia midwives before selecting Coley. Aware of the social dimensions of media, Stoney initially hesitated to cast Coley because he worried that her screen image could be conflated with contemporary representations of black women on screen, like Hattie McDaniel's Academy Award-winning performance as Mammy in Gone with the Wind. Ultimately, Coley's fit as a model of hygienic clinical practice that could be exported internationally as evidence of the competence of American medicine secured her the role.In her documentary film performance, Coley exhibited multiple layers of credibility--as a mother, as a spiritual leader, and as a science-based health professional. Over a four- month period, Stoney accompanied Coley as she went about her work of visiting women and delivering babies in the Albany area. Coley not only performed but also collaborated in developing the script. Her sons and three grandchildren performed roles in the film as well. The filming focused on two women (Ida and Marybelle), in circumstances both ideal as well as challenging, and included a live birth scene. He filmed her, her patients and their surroundings, and her interactions with patients and medical professionals. Stoney became impressed with the skill, ingenuity, and high standards for cleanliness that Coley brought to her work, as well as the strong influence she had with her patients and their families. The resulting film, All My Babies: A Midwife's Own Story followed Coley through the births of two babies. Its use for the training of midwives expanded from Georgia to other parts of the American South and eventually the rest of the world, via UNESCO and the World Health Organization. The film was critically acclaimed as a documentary. In 1953 it was honored with a special Robert J. Flaherty Award for documentary film. In 2002, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, calling it a \\"landmark\\". A 1999 retrospective of the work of George Stoney described All My Babies as having made Mary Coley \\"one of the towering figures of the documentary tradition\\". In 2007, Stoney produced a second film about Coley, a reunion of 150 people whom Coley had delivered as a midwife. Legacy Coley was featured in the 2005 exhibition \\"Reclaiming Midwives: Pillars of Community Support\\" at the Smithsonian's Anacostia Community Museum, and in a traveling photograph and film exhibit entitled, \\"Reclaiming Midwives: Stills from All My Babies\\", which ran from November 13, 2006 to April 2, 2007. In 2005 she was also featured in exhibitions at the Columbia University School of Nursing and the Mailman School of Public Health. In 2011 she was inducted onto the list of Georgia Women of Achievement. References  Bibliography  Bowdoin, J. P. (1928). The Midwife Problem.

Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. ___ (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case that held that a statutory private right of action under the Lanham Act is not precluded by regulatory provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act., 134 S. Ct. 2228 (2014). Background =Regulation of food and drug labeling= In 1938, the United States Congress passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in order to regulate the safety of food, drugs, and cosmetics. Under the Act, the Food and Drug Administration has issued regulations governing food and beverage labeling, including the labeling of mixes of different types of juice into one juice blend. In particular, if a juice blend does not name all the juices it contains and mentions only juices that are not predominant in the blend, then it must either declare the percentage content of the named juice or \\"[i]ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or flavoring.\\" Private parties are not allowed to bring enforcement actions under the Act. In addition, Congress amended it in order to provide for preemption of certain State laws dealing with product misbranding. =Lanham Act claims= In 1946, Congress enacted the Lanham Act in order to govern the use of trademarks. Among its stated aims was the regulation of \\"commerce within the control of Congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce,\\" and provision was made for civil enforcement actions to be available for private parties in the federal courts. =The case at hand= POM Wonderful was a grower of pomegranates and a distributor of pomegranate juices, including a pomegranate- blueberry juice blend. The Coca-Cola Company, through its Minute Maid division, created a pomegranate-blueberry juice product that in reality was 99.4% apple and grape juices. The front label of its package carried the words \\"pomegranate blueberry\\" in capital letters, below which the phrase \\"flavored blend of 5 juices\\" appeared in much smaller type, followed in still smaller type by \\"from concentrate with added ingredients and other natural flavors\\" (presented over two lines). POM brought suit under the Lanham Act in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of Coca-Cola's juice blend misled consumers as to its actual content, thereby causing POM to lose sales. Lower courts The District Court granted partial summary judgment to Coca- Cola, ruling that the FDCA and its regulations preclude challenges to the name and the label of Coca-Cola's juice blend. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in the relevant part. Supreme Court decision The Ninth Circuit ruling was reversed and remanded. In a unanimous decision written by Justice Kennedy, the Court held: :* The case was one not of preemption but of preclusion and so any \\"presumption against pre- emption\\" has no force. \\"Although the Court's pre-emption precedent does not govern preclusion analysis in this case, its principles are instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws that bear on the same subject.\\" :* As this is a statutory interpretation case, the Court relies on traditional rules of statutory interpretation. That does not change because the case involves multiple federal statutes, nor does it change because an agency is involved. :* \\"When two statutes complement each other, it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Congress nonetheless intended one federal statute to preclude the operation of the other.\\" :* \\"A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels would not only ignore the distinct functional aspects of the FDCA and the Lanham Act but also would lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend.\\" :* \\"Even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so, it is a bridge too far to accept an agency's after-the-fact statement to justify that result here. An agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.\\" Subsequent jury trial The case went back to the California federal district court and eventually proceeded to jury trial, where it was established that Coca-Cola Co.'s Minute Maid \\"Enhanced Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored 100% Juice Blend\\" was 99.4% apple and grape juices and only 0.3% pomegranate juice, 0.2% blueberry juice, and 0.1% raspberry juice. On March 18, 2016, POM made its closing arguments, and the case went to the jury with POM claiming losses of $10 million per year from 2007 to 2014 (totaling more than $77 million) caused by Coca-Cola's Minute Maid pomegranate and blueberry juice drink misleading labeling and advertising. On March 21, 2016, the California jury unanimously rejected POM's claim that the labeling of Minute Maid's pomegranate-blueberry juice blend (which did comply with FDA labeling requirements) was either misleading or unfair competition and found that the labeling did not mislead a substantial portion of consumers, in favor of Coca- Cola, ending eight years of litigation.

He graduated from the University of Edinburgh, where he studied agriculture. Not yet 20, he immigrated to the United States, arriving on May 4, 1832. Career From 1832 to 1840, he worked as a clerk and merchant in New York City, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio. He served as the editor of the Western Farmer and Gardener in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1840 to 1842. He acquired Ingleside Farm in Washington, Mississippi, where he established Central Nurseries in 1848. It became one of the earliest commercial plant nurseries in the Southern United States. He was one of the first nurserymen in the South, selling plants and writing about plants from the South. Most agricultural and gardening advice had previously been written by authorities from Europe or the Northern United States. In 1848, Affleck edited Norman's Southern Agricultural Almanac, an almanac published by Benjamin Moore Norman (1809-1860). He also published the Southern Rural Almanac and Plantation and Garden Calendar from 1851 to 1861.Google Books His \\"Report on Agricultural Grasses,\\" appeared as a Senate executive document in 1879. He is credited with advancing agriculture in Texas thanks to his writing. Moreover, he published two books about his plantation, where he cultivated the commodity crops of cotton and sugar cane with slave labor: Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book and Sugar Plantation Record and Account Book. They became widely popular among the planter class, who used them as models for their own plantations. In 1859, he purchased the Glenblythe Plantation in Gay Hill, Washington County, Texas.

Born into a theatrical family, Blanche made her stage debut at the age of fourteen and had a forty- five year career, almost exclusively on the British stage, in the West End and on tour. In the 1890s she was a leading principal boy in London's most lavishly staged pantomimes. In the 20th century her career changed to playing comic, formidable older women. Her most celebrated role of this kind was in the hit musical The Arcadians (1909), staged by her brother-in-law Robert Courtneidge. Beyond musical comedy, Blanche appeared in farces and other comedies in non-singing roles between 1906 and her retirement in 1921. Among her co-stars during her long career were George Grossmith Jr., Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd, Walter Passmore, Kate Santley and Little Tich. Life and career =Early years= Blanche was born in Brixton, London, the daughter of the singer and actress Cicely Nott and her husband, Sam Adams, a theatre manager.Parker, p. 87 The couple had five children, all of whom were later professionally associated with the theatre, including Rosaline, known professionally as Rosie Nott, who married the impresario Robert Courtneidge and was the mother of Cicely Courtneidge.Pepys-Whiteley, D. \\"Courtneidge, Dame (Esmerelda) Cicely (1893‚Äì1980)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, retrieved 13 June 2014 At the age of fourteen Blanche made her stage debut in London's Adelphi Theatre Christmas show, Little Goody Two Shoes.

Returning to Britain she joined Dion Boucicault's touring company, together with her mother and another sister, Edith Blanche. Between tours Blanche was establishing herself in the West End. In 1886 she appeared at the Gaiety Theatre, under the management of George Edwardes, in a supporting role in the burlesque Monte Cristo Jr.. She understudied the theatre's star, Nellie Farren, and when Edwardes assembled touring companies Blanche was cast in Farren's principal boy parts in this and later shows. On tour or in London she played in the burlesques Little Jack Sheppard (1886) and Miss Esmeralda (1887), and, as Farren aged, Blanche took the title roles in Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© (1890) and Joan of Arc (1891). Blanche was only briefly among the top names in West End burlesque, but in the 1890s she achieved and maintained the highest degree of stardom in pantomime under the management of Sir Augustus Harris at Drury Lane. In the six seasons from December 1892 she starred there in the theatre's lavish pantomime versions of Little Bo-Peep, Robinson Crusoe, Dick Whittington and His Cat, Cinderella, Aladdin and Babes in the Wood. In the title role of Robinson Crusoe, she was singled out by The Times for mention before her famous co-stars, Little Tich, Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd and Herbert Campbell. The paper commented, \\"Miss Ada Blanche as Robinson Crusoe would probably have astonished Daniel Defoe; but her liveliness and amusing impertinence atoned for lack of fidelity to the original character.\\"\\"Drury Lane Theatre\\", The Times, 12 March 1896, p. 6 In Dick Whittington, a reporter for The Era thought she \\"sang well, danced well and acted well\\", going onto say: \\"she was the life and soul of the evening. When the entertainment was flagging, on she came with her relentless spirit and energy.\\"\\"Miss Ada Blanche: Dick Whittington, Theatre Royal, Drury Lane\\", The Era, 26 January 1895, p. 14 =Later career= with Tom Terriss in The Medal and the Maid, 1903 As the 1890s went on, Blanche was given a few starring roles in musical comedy. Harris presented an English version of La demoiselle du t√©l√©phone, an operette by Maurice Desvalli√®res and Gaston Serpette. With an English text by Harris and F. C. Burnand, The Telephone Girl debuted in 1896 and toured the provinces off and on until 1900, with Blanche in the title role. The Manchester Guardian observed: Outside the pantomime season, Blanche's West End seasons during the late 1890s and early 1900s were few. In 1898 she co-starred with Courtice Pounds and Lottie Venne in The Royal Star, which ran only briefly; the following year she joined George Grossmith Jr. and Willie Edouin in Great Caesar, as Cleopatra to Grossmith's Mark Antony.\\"Comedy Theatre\\", The Times, 1 May 1899, p. 14 In 1903 she was in another musical comedy, The Medal and the Maid, which ran for six months. She played in Robert Courteidge's pantomimes in 1903 to 1905 and toured in a farce, What the Butler Saw, from 1906 to 1908. The great West End success of Blanche's career came in her mid-40s in the hit musical comedy The Arcadians, in which she had the non-singing comic role of Mrs Smith, the wife of the protagonist. The piece ran from April 1909 until August 1911. Courtneidge later cast her in three more of his productions: she played Mitsu in The Mousme (1911), Mrs Baxter-Browne in The Pearl Girl (1913), and Lady Elizabeth Weston in The Rebel Maid (1921).

The half-timbered building from 1686 was rebuilt from 1813 to 1822 in the Neoclassical style by the statesman Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow. Since 1940, it has housed the Reventlow Museum. History Pederstrup was first mentioned in the 1340s when the estate belonged to Rigsdrost Laurits Jonsen. A vaulted cellar from the mid-16th century is the oldest remaining part of the building which then served as the residence of the king's vassal. In 1576, King Frederick II sold the property to the Venstermand family. In 1684, the half-timbered building was purchased by the statesman Peder von Brandt who added two symmetrical wings in the Baroque style. Niels L√ºtzen: Pederstrup, 1863 Pederstrup after Meldahls's alterations (1872) In 1725, the estate was acquired by Count Christian Detlev Reventlow, the half-brother of Anna Sophie Reventlow, Frederick IV's second wife. A countship was created for the Reventlow family in 1729, known as Christianss√¶de. From 1775, his son Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow brought Pederstrup into a period of great prosperity. Between 1813 and 1822, with the assistance of the architect C.F. Hansen, he undertook major extensions in the Neoclassical style. In 1858, his grandson Ferdinand Reventlow commissioned Ferdinand Meldahl to convert the manor into a little French ch√¢teau complete with towers and spires. In 1938, after the Reventlows ran into economic difficulties and had to sell the property, Viggo Sten M√∏ller restored the building to its former Neoclassical appearance in order to serve as a museum. Reventlow Museum Pederstrup viewed from the park The museum contains items belonging to C.D.F. Reventlow, his family and friends, especially those concerned with the reforms in Danish society around 1800. There is an important collection of portraits painted by the most influential artists of the day including Jens Juel, C.A. Jensen and C:W: Eckersberg. The house, with period furnishings, also displays many of Reventlow's personal effects including his orders and medals. There is also a park which is open throughout the year. The museum itself is open from 11 am to 4 pm on Saturdays and Sundays year round and from Tuesday to Sunday from June to August.

Ahokas has won thirty Finnish championship titles, collected four medals (one gold, two silver, and one bronze) at the European Championships, and also represented his nation Finland in four editions of the Olympic Games (1988, 1992, 1996, and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Ahokas trained for Nurmon Jymy Wrestling Club in Sein√§joki under his father and personal coach Risto Ahokas. Ahokas made his official debut, as an 18-year-old teen, at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, where he lost the second round of the elimination pool to U.S. wrestler Dennis Koslowski in the men's heavyweight division. Four years later, at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Ahokas competed in the super heavyweight category (130 kg) and slammed Greece's Panagiotis Poikilidis off the mat with a 1‚Äì0 sudden death lead to finish strongly in seventh. Determined to return to the Olympic scene and medal, Ahokas entered the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta as a top medal favorite in the men's 130 kg class. He beat Sweden's Tomas Johansson in his opening match, but suffered a tremendous fall from the unbeatable Russian and reigning Olympic champion Aleksandr Karelin in the third round. Facing off against Ukraine's Petro Kotok in the fourth repechage, Ahokas could not score a single point to subdue his opponent and lost the match with a fourteenth-place finish. Despite a stunning upset from his third Games, Ahokas took home his first medal at the 1997 European Championships in Kouvola, and continued to flourish his sporting success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, until he wrestled Hungary's Mih√°ly De√°k-B√°rdos for the gold in the 120-kg division at the 2003 European Championships in Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro. Eight years after his last Olympics and having missed the previous Games due to back injury, Ahokas qualified for the Finnish squad, as a 34-year-old veteran, in the men's 120 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Earlier in the process, he received a ticket and rounded out the seventh spot from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Cr√©teil, France. Aged and frail, Ahokas lost two straight matches to his former rival De√°k-B√°rdos (0‚Äì3) and Iran's Sajjad Barzi through a 1‚Äì2 tight brawl in the prelim pool, finishing only in seventeenth place out of twenty super heavyweight wrestlers. Ahokas ended his illustrious sporting career with another silver medal at the 2006 European Championships in Moscow, before he officially retired by the following year due to spinal and shoulder injuries sustained in the past.

Its name in Franco-Proven√ßal might mean \\"Grand River\\" or \\"River from the Mountaintops\\" (eva d'en som). In archival documents it is often referred to as l'eau blanche (French for \\"Whitewater\\"). The Unit√© des communes vald√¥taines de l'√âvan√ßon takes its name from the stream.  Course  The stream has its origin in the Great Glacier of Verra at the top of the val d'Ayas. After coursing right through the valley, the √âvan√ßon flows into the Dora Baltea in the comune of Verr√®s, near the bridge of Fleuran. From source to valley floor it crosses four municipalities: Ayas, Brusson, Challand-Saint-Anselme, and Challand-Saint- Victor. Near Targnod in the commune of Challand-Saint-Victor, the stream dashes into the Gorge de Brisecou (French for \\"Breakneck Gorge\\"), forming the impressive rapids of that name. Its base can be reached by a short walk from the road to Isollaz and a good observation spot can be reached by car on the road which leads to Verr√®s Castle. The √âvan√ßon is a typical glacial river, which means that maximum flow is reached in the summer on account of the melting of the glacier and minimum flow occurs in winter - the opposite of other rivers. The colour of the water in the stream varies from azure in the morning and when it is cold through to a grey-white towards the evening and after a very hot day. Only in the winter is the river transparent, while in the summer it is more or less clouded by sediment and sand from the glacier.  Fauna  The stream is inhabited exclusively by trout (both brown and rainbow, repopulated annually by the regional fish consortium. Among the wildlife must be mentioned the white-throated dipper which is present in great numbers.  Human activity  To protect the inhabited area of the plain which has suffered from flooding in the past, protective walls have been built. Unfortunately, in addition to harming the naturalness and aesthetic appearance of the stream, these have made it less hospitable to the trout. Along its course the stream is used to produce hydroelectric power. In the comune of Brusson, is found the Isollaz dam which extracts power from the river.

His parents were captain Carl Leonard Hammarskj√∂ld and Beata Hammarskj√∂ld, born Tham. In 1870, he married Lucie von Krusenstjerna, daughter of Captain G.

When his father died, the family willed the Tuna mansion to Hugo Hammarskj√∂ld and brother Carl Hammarskj√∂ld, whereupon Hugo would reside at the estate. Hammarskj√∂ld entered politics at a young age, but mostly dealt in church politics. He was elected to the second chamber of the Swedish riksdag in 1893 and was re-elected in 1903 serving two separate terms, 1894-1896 and 1903-1908. From 1909-1918 he was part of the F√∂rsta kammaren. In 1905, he was offered a position as the Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs but declined. Nonetheless, another offer was made in 1906 from Arvid Lindman, which Hammarskj√∂ld accepted. Even as a minister, Hammarskj√∂ld's interest for religion and church related topics would to be critical. Through a proposal that the elementary school should be run by the city council in Sweden's biggest cities, something that already was being done in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂, he received a great deal of resistance from the likes of Gottfrid Billing. When he later made a proposal concerning the so-called priestly privileges, which Hammarskj√∂ld found old fashioned, and the wage control for priests, it was voted down in the first chamber. After this, Hammarskj√∂ld chose to leave the government.

Since the first protests during the Arab Spring, the increasingly violent Syrian Civil War has been both a proxy war for the major Middle Eastern powers, Turkey and Iran, and a potential launching point for a wider regional war. Fears of the latter were realized when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Salafi Jihadist militant group and alleged former al-Qaeda affiliate, established itself in Syria in 2013, and later combined with the Iraqi Civil War into a single conflict the following year. The spillover of the Syrian Civil War is often dubbed the Arab Winter. Iraq For much of 2012, the Iraqi government had turned a blind eye to the Sunni and Salafist militias crossing the border into Syria. This toleration ended when Salafist militias connected to al-Qaeda ambushed a convoy filled with unarmed Syrian soldiers at Akashat on the Syrian side of the border. This led to greater fighting throughout the country, Operation al-Shabah in May 2013 in which the Iraqi Army failed to wipe these militias out and the consolidation of several of them with ISIL. Al Anbar Governorate became a battle zone and an airstrike in April 2014 was of little use, because in June 2014 ISIL launched an offensive in northern Iraq, taking large swaths of the country and threatening Baghdad itself. In response, Iran reportedly deployed its Quds force in Iraq, thus turning the conflict into a full-scale war. =Iraqi‚ÄìSyrian border incidents= The Akashat ambush was a well planned assault against a Syrian Army convoy defended by Iraqi soldiers that took place on 4 March 2013, as the group was travelling in the province of Anbar, next to the border with Syria. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the ambush on 11 March. 51 Syrian soldiers were killed in the clashes. Another 9 Iraqi soldiers were killed as well from insurgent fire. The attackers carried unknown casualties. In March 2013, a source from Sinjar hospital said that Free Syrian Army attacked Iraqi soldiers after entering Iraqi territories. Since January 2014, The Islamic State has mutated and grown into a massive pseudo country which has taken over much of Iraq and Syria and erased the border between the two countries in a new, multinational war. In June 2016, the New Syrian Army, backed by the United States, overtook ISIL forces in the border town of al-Bukamal. The city is essential to a key route linking eastern Syria to Iraq. However, in the hours following ISIL launched a counteroffensive and retook al-Bukamal, with the New Syrian Army suffering significant casualties. As of May 10, 2017, ISIL has maintained control over al-Bukamal and the key route linking Syria and Iraq. ISIL has additionally conducted attacks near the Waled-Tanif Border Crossing to the south, and west of Mosul in the north. The significant territorial control ISIL maintains surrounding al-Bukamal allows for relatively easy passage between the two nations.http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Sanctuary%20Map%2010%20MAY.pdf Lebanon The Syrian Civil War has led to incidents of sectarian violence in northern Lebanon between supporters and opponents of the Syrian government, and armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli. Fighting between rebels and government forces has spilled into Lebanon on several occasions. The Syrian Air Force has conducted air strikes on targets in Lebanon, while rebels have launched rockets on Hezbollah targets. Fighting between supporters of the Sunni sheikh Ahmed Al-Assir, who is against Hezbollah's involvement in Syria, and the Lebanese army has killed at least 15 of its soldiers.Deadly fighting rages in Lebanon Al Jazeera, 24 June 2013 =Lebanese‚ÄìSyrian border= At the beginning of summer 2012, two Hezbollah fighters were killed in a clash with Syrian rebels who were on Lebanese territory. On 17 September, Syrian Ground-attack aircraft fired three missiles over the border into Lebanese territory near Arsal. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted Lebanese president Michel Sleiman to launch an investigation, whilst not publicly blaming Syria for the incident. On 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from dignified locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being \\"neutral from the conflicts of others\\". He called on border residents to \\"stand beside their army and assist its members.\\" Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns. On 11 October 2012, four shells fired by the Syrian military hit Masharih al-Qaa, where previous shelling incidents have caused fatalities. Lebanon's position of ignoring the attacks and dissociating itself from the conflict remained unchanged. In October 2012 Hassan Nasrallah denied Hezbollah members were fighting alongside the Syrian army, but that Lebanese in Syria were only protecting Lebanese inhabited villages from the Free Syrian Army. In August 2014, the Syrian air force bombed the Lebanese side of the border. In December of that year, they used barrel bombs on suspected rebel installations northwest of Arsal. =Lebanon vs. ISIL and al-Nusra Front= Starting in June 2014, Hezbollah began battling with Islamists along the Lebanese border, who had crossed into Lebanon several times and threatened to throw the country into full-scale war. From 2‚Äì5 August 2014, the Lebanese Army clashed with Syrian gunmen in the town of Arsal, which left over a hundred soldiers on both sides dead. On 21 August 2014, the al-Nusra Front invaded Lebanon near Arsal and the Bekaa Valley town of Al-Fakiha. Following a battle between them and Hezbollah, seven Hezbollah fighters and 32 Syrian terrorists died in clashes around the Syrian village of Nahleh, just over the border from Arsal.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon- News/2014/Jul-17/264184-hezbollah-nusra-front-clash-near-lebanon-border Dozens of hostages were taken back to Syria during the above-mentioned battle of Arsal. After fruitless negotiations, the Lebanese cabinet voted to authorize the army to invade Syria to free them on 4 September 2014, something that they have yet to do. There was another attempted invasion of Lebanon by a joint ISIL-Nusra force in early October, which was beaten back by Hezbullah, and in January 2015. In December 2015, after over a year and a half in captivity, Lebanese troops held prisoner by Al Nusra were exchanged for prisoners held in Lebanon. =Hezbollah vs. ISIL= In June 2015, the Hezbollah claimed that it was in the midst of a major battle with ISIL, which it claimed had invaded Lebanon and seized territory. On 21 July 2017 Hezbollah along with the Syrian Army declared an offensive on the seized territories by insurgents. On 22 July 2017 Hezbollah officials claimed capturing several points of the re-seized territories. Turkey With a thousand-mile border with Syria and Iraq, there have been a number of incidents involving this nation with various factions in the conflicts south of the border. =Syrian‚ÄìTurkish border clashes= Openly supporting the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad Turkey permitted the establishment of a \\"jihadist highway\\" where rebels of all stripes, including ISIL, were permitted to cross both supplies and personnel South of the border. There were various incidents including the shooting down of a Turkish Air Force jet by Syria which killed the 2 pilots and also the shooting down of a Syrian Air Force jet by Turkey, and a February 2015 raid by the Turkish army to evacuate a tiny exclave in Syria. =Turkey and ISIL= Turkey had been allegedly supporting ISIL throughout its many incarnations as a \\"lesser evil\\" against the Assad government. This to some extent began to change with the 2013 Reyhanlƒ± bombings and a retaliatory airstrike in January 2014. ISIL shook this off and began its conquest of northern Iraq, followed by consolidation of territories in Northern Syria. In the summer of 2014 it began taking over the border area with Turkey, leading to hundreds of thousands of refugees coming north along the border, riots, the use of teargas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, as well the end of the truce with the PKK. A vote to authorize military action was passed by the Turkish parliament on 2 October 2014. However, it had no follow-through and further rioting ensued through much of Turkey's cities as the government demanded more and more conditions to join in the war. The riots intensified and several dozen protesters have been killed. The relationship between ISIL and Turkey deteriorated during the spring and summer of 2015, leading to sniping at the border and airstrikes by the Turks. =Siege of the S√ºleyman Shah Tomb= On 22 February 2015, the Turkish army invaded Syria via Kobani and drove to the S√ºleyman Shah Tomb, which was dismantled and brought back to Turkey. The 40 guards, who were due to return home months before, were also rescued. About 100 military vehicles, including 39 tanks, were involved along with 572 military personnel, one of which was killed in an accident. Thirty to thirty-six Turkish soldiers were stationed there to guard the tomb. An attack on the tomb, considered Turkish territory under a 1921 Franco-Turkish agreement, was under threat earlier in the year, prompting the government to declare that it would retaliate against any such attack, and would serve as a casus belli. The Syrian government said the raid was an act of \\"flagrant aggression\\" and that it would hold Ankara responsible for its repercussions. =Russian warplane downing= On 24 November 2015, a Russian warplane was shot down in the Syrian-Turkey border area. Turkey claims the plane violated Turkish airspace, a claim Russia denies. Early reports from multiple Russian news agencies indicated that the plane had been downed by a ground-based strike from Syrian rebels, but Russian officials later confirmed the Turkish reports that the plane had been downed by Turkish fighter jets. According to Turkish officials, the Russian jet, an SU-24, was shot down by two Turkish F-16 jets after multiple requests (10 requests in a five-minute span) for the Russian jet to change its course. Turkey maintains that the Russian jet violated its airspace, flying over Turkish territory despite warnings to change course, while Russia states that its jet never entered Turkish airspace and was over Syria the whole time. Turkey produced a graphic showing the Russian plane's flight pattern, which appears to show it crossing the southern tip of Hatay Province before being shot down and crashing near Turkmen Mountain near the Syria-Turkey border. Turkey had previously warned Russia about violations to Turkish airspace, and had also warned them off strikes against civilian Syrian Turkmen living along the Turkish border. Russia has steadfastly maintained \\"throughout its flight, the aircraft remained exclusively above Syrian territory.\\" In response, Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that the attack was \\"a stab in the back by the accomplices of terrorists.\\" =Kurdish conflict= The 2015 conflict between Turkey and the PKK broke out following two year-long peace negotiations, which began in late 2012, but failed to progress in light of the growing tensions on border with Syria in late 2014, when the Siege of Kobani created an unprecedented wave of Kurdish refugees into Turkey. Some of the Kurds accused Turkey of assisting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) during the crisis, resulting in widespread Kurdish riots in Turkey involving dozens of fatalities. The tensions further escalated in summer 2015 with the 20 July bombing in Suru√ß, allegedly executed by an ISIL-affiliated Turkish group against Kurdish supporters. On 21 July, the PKK killed a Turkish soldier and wounded 2 more in Adƒ±yaman. Some PKK supporters then claimed responsibility for the 23 July killing of two Turkish police officers in Ceylanpinar, describing it as a retaliation. Jordan There have been several incidents on the 375 km long border between Syria and Jordan. Jordan hosts nearly 600,000 registered Syrian refugees‚Äîalthough Jordanian officials say the total number is 1.4 million. Heavy shelling aimed at Daraa in Syria has accidentally hit the Jordanian side of the border from time to time, usually causing only light or no damage. However, there have been occurrences where armed men have been killed or injured in engagements with Jordanian border patrols soldiers. In April 2014, the Jordanian Air Force launched an airstrike on soldiers trying to illegally cross the border from Syria. Since then, attempted militant infiltration into Jordan has become commonplace. Some of this was due to the return of Jordanian citizens who, as jihadists, went to fight in Syria for a while and decided to go home for various reasons. According to reports, there are over 2000 Jordanian Jihadis fighting in Syria. Over a hundred have been arrested and charged for crossing the border to fight, which is illegal in Jordan. Since October 2014, Jordan has been an active part of the anti-ISIS coalition, contributing to the American-led campaign of airstrikes. Two incidents occurred in January 2016. On 23 January Jordanian armed forces spokesman stated that a total of 36 armed men tried to infiltrate the border and an engagement with Jordanian border patrol left 12 dead while the rest retreated back into Syria. They were found to have 2,000,000 drug pills. The spokesperson also stated that \\"Jordan will not tolerate any infiltration attempt and will strike with an iron fist to whoever tries to disrupt Jordanian national security\\". On 25 January, two armed men tried to infiltrate the borders and were killed. They were found to have 2600 palm-sized bags of cannabis and 2.4 million Captagon pills. Syrian‚ÄìIsraeli ceasefire line On 25 September 2012, several mortar shells landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, landing in an open area adjacent to the border fence. Overall, throughout October and early November, several Syrian mortar and light artillery shells hit the Golan Heights. One mortar round may have been responsible for a brushfire that erupted in the area. On 3 November, three Syrian tanks entered the demilitarized zone in the central Golan Heights as a number of mortar shells were fired into the area. On 5 November, an Israeli army jeep was damaged by Syrian army gunfire as it patrolled the border. On 11 November, after a Syrian 120mm mortar round hit the eastern Golan Heights, the Israeli army responded by firing an electro-optic anti-tank missile in the direction of a Syrian mortar crew, but they deliberately missed them, intending it as a warning shot. On 12 November, another Syrian mortar shell struck the Golan Heights, and Israeli tanks deployed along the border responded by targeting two Syrian mortar launchers. A direct hit was confirmed. A shell fired from Syria, where insurgents and government troops are locked in fierce fighting, exploded in the Israeli-occupied part of the Golan Heights plateau on Sunday, 14 July 2013. On 22 and 23 June 2015 two ambulances transporting wounded Syrian rebels were attacked by Druze protesters in the Golan Heights. One of the injured persons was killed in the incident. The attacks followed an interview with a rebel who had been treated in Israel and promised to come back to Syria to fight against the Druze minority. On 10 February 2018, an Iranian drone was reported to have entered Israeli airspace, which was shot down by the Israeli Air Force. In retaliation, the IAF struck Iranian targets inside Syria. During the attack on the Iranian targets, Syrian anti-air defense systems shot down an Israeli F-16 fighter jet. 2 hours after the downing of the jet, Israel began attacking additional targets inside Syria. Distant spillover locations =Egypt= =Libya= The takeover of the city of Derna in Cyrenaica, Libya by the self- declared Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took place in late 2014. In November 2014, Wilayat Darnah (the province of Darnah) or Wilayat Barqah (Province of Eastern Libya) was declared an integral part the so-called \\"Islamic State\\". ISIL controlled the city from October 2014 until it fell to the Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna in June 2015 who were subsequently defeated by the Libyan National Army during the Battle of Derna. ISIL in Libya posted a video online on 15 February 2015 depicting the killing of 21 Egyptian Copts. The video bore similarities to previous videos showing the \\"execution\\" of Western and Japanese hostages, including the orange jumpsuits worn by the victims and the method of killing by decapitation. Egypt responded to the video by launching airstrikes against targets in Derna. =Yemen= Yemeni ISIL members are quite silent in their operations, with isolated attacks on all sides like Houthis, Hadi government, AQAP and Southern Movement attacks. =Kuwait= On 26 June 2015, ISIL militants blew up a Shiite mosque in Kuwait City killing dozens and injuring hundreds. =France= A campaign of Islamist attacks occurred in France, beginning with the √éle-de-France attacks on 7 January 2015, between the French Government and ongoing terrorist acts committed by jihadist terror groups like AQAP and ISIL, or isolated individuals who sympathise with the jihadist movement. Since 2015 and until July 2016, eight Islamic terrorist incidents have occurred in France, including fatal attacks in √éle-de-France, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier and Paris. The November 2015 attacks in Paris were motivated by ISIL as a \\"retaliation\\" for the French role in Syrian Civil War and Iraqi War.\\"Seven Militants Led Deadly Paris Attacks\\" The Wall Street Journal. \\"Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks on a social media account, but didn‚Äôt provide specific information that would allow the claim to be verified. It said the attacks were retaliation for French airstrikes against the group in Syria and Iraq.\\" =Bangladesh= A majority of attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh since October 2015 have been claimed by ISIL. In November 2015, the ISIL magazine Dabiq published an article calling for the \\"revival of jihad in Bengal\\". Since then, radical Islamic militants have assassinated Bangladeshi secularists, atheists, writers, bloggers, LGBT activists, Sufi and liberal Muslims, Hindu and Buddhist priests and Christian missionaries, as well as foreign expatriates from Europe and East Asia. On 1 July 2016, six gunmen stormed an upmarket restaurant in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, killed customers of various nationalities and held hostages for nearly 12 hours, before the Bangladesh army ended the siege. ISIL claimed credit for the attack and reportedly released photographs of both the gunmen and victims from inside the restaurant during the hostage crisis. The government of Bangladesh, however, has refuted ISIL claims and denies the group has any presence in the country. It has instead blamed local terrorist outfits, particularly the Jamaat-ul- Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and the Ansarullah Bangla Team, both of which have been linked to the country's far-right Islamist opposition parties. =Philippines= ISIL got support from many Islamist groups in Mindanao, namely Abu Sayyaf Group, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, Ansar Khalifa Philippines, Khalifa Islamiya Mindanao, and Maute Group, the latter stormed Marawi along with elements of other groups, culminating in months-long Battle of Marawi. Known ISIL allies were Isnilon Hapilon, Abdullah Maute, Omar Maute, and Jafar Maguid =Afghanistan= ISIL-KP was in direct competition of Taliban. The group was composed of disgruntled Taliban members, and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan members. They occupy some parts of Afghanistan, clashing with Taliban and Afghan government. =Caucasus= =South and Central Africa= Boko Haram joins ISIL, they started attacking nearby settlements, initially victorious, until Nigeria, Chad and Niger attack in simulation. =Algeria= =Pakistan= Unlike Taliban, ISIL was quite not active in Pakistan, save for cross-border attacks.

It is the only Anglican Parish in Indonesia but there are 35 other Anglican churches throughout the country. The church is located in Jalan Arief Rahman Hakim, close to the Farmer's Statue. It is among the oldest church in Indonesia and was built in 1832. The churchyard of All Saints Church contains gravestones of British soldiers who fell during World War I and World War II, and earlier memorials e.g. Lieutenant Colonel William Campbell (died in 1811). History Land in Batavia was purchased by Rev. John Slater of the London Missionary Society in 1819 to establish a station for chaplains to disembark to Asian countries such as China or Japan. This is the first English-speaking institution in Indonesia. On January 7, 1822, Reverend Walter Henry Medhurst was sent by London Missionary Society to work among the Chinese. In the same year he built a bamboo church over the land. The bamboo church lasted until 1828 when the church was renovated. The building was finished in 1829 in Georgian Style, without the extensions (the chancel, the sanctuary and the porch). At that time it was called Anglican Church, Dutch Engelse Kerk or Indonesian Gereja Inggris. The church became affiliated with the Church of England and the original Missionary layout was changed. A sanctuary was added in 1851. A small organ was installed in 1857. This is replaced with a larger organ which is placed in a newly built special room in 1863. In 1924, these two were combined to form the chancel and sanctuary, the layout that is known today. In 1883, the British Protestant Community was formed which took over the church property. As a result, the name of the church was changed into Church of the British Protestant Community (BPC). Electricity was installed in 1909. The British Protestant community continued to own the property until April 1965 when Australian ambassador Mick Shann transferred the property to the Indonesian Council of Churches as a gift. Then church became known as All Saints Church in 1970 and serves an international community of 30 nationalities.

In 1981, Metal ware Corporation Purchased the NESCO trade name for roaster ovens along with all dies, tooling, equipment, and finished goods inventory from the previous owners.Madison Wisconsin State Journal, January 18, 1981, sec 2, p 14 The roasters were being manufactured in New York, but at one time had been previously manufactured in Wisconsin. In 1985, Metal Ware purchased MIRRO Outdoor Products and began manufacturing and marketing the Open Country¬Æ line of camp cookware and in 1987 bought MAFCO (Monarch Appliance and Fabricating Company), a porcelain finishing and metal stamping facility in Algoma, Wis. A major boost to the company began in 1991 when the QVC television shopping channel began selling their NESCO roasters on national basis. In addition to large phone sales through QVC, the national exposure expanded their access to other retail stores as customers were asking for the roasters in the stores. The exposure was also a big help with the launch of a new product, a convection roaster called the Roast-Aire.Madison Capital Times, April 4, 1996, sec C, p 2 By 1997 one million units had shipped. In 1996, it acquired a tabletop cooking grill product line from Algonquin Mercantile Corporation, a small appliance maker in Ontario, Canada, and brought that production into Wisconsin. In 1997, it acquired a Wisconsin plastics molding company and obtained the assets of Minnesota-based American Harvest, Inc., well known for its food dehydrator. With this addition, the company created a new brand‚ÄîNESCO¬Æ/American Harvest‚Ñ¢. Metal Ware continues to expand its product lines and find new paths to develop markets and build value. The Open Country¬Æ collection now includes a Fish Scaler, Jerky Seasonings and cooking accessories for outdoor enthusiasts, and the electrics line contains an array of pressure cookers, Jet-Steam Ovens, bread maker, food grinders and slicers, hand blenders, juicers and coffee products. In developing its coffee bean roaster, Metal Ware developed a unique method to convert the harsh odors typical of this process into the fragrance that draws coffee lovers. The classic Roaster Oven comes in many sizes and colors. The basic design of the Spa Pro¬Æ Massage Stone Heater is based on the roaster over. The current product line includes a coffee blade grinder, coffee roasters, coffee urn, food slicers, food grinders, pressure cookers, juice blenders, water kettles, food steamers, bread machine, waffle maker, toasters, and a portable induction cooktop. = 2014-Present = In 2016, The Metal Ware Corporation merged with Chard International, an outdoor cooking and meat preparation product company, owned by Richard Carey and business partner Ross Niemi. The merger brought 14 new employees to Metal Ware. Richard Carey took over as President of Metal Ware and Ross Niemi as the COO. The Metal Ware Corp is currently expanding, adding new brands and product lines such as Grizzly Docks and DeWALT Coolers. Along with new products, The Metal Ware Corp is also currently working to increase domestic production. To do so, Metal Ware has added three plastic injection molding machines, as well as a new plastic Roto Molding machine increasing production jobs by 50% in the last three years within their six facilities.  Patents and Trademarks  As is common with many corporations, the Metal Ware Corporation applied for and was granted numerous patents for its products over the course of its existence. It has also become the assignee for patents for companies that it has acquired. = Utility Patents = # Canteen construction # Method for Rapidly Cooking Food # Cooking system and accessories # Assemblies for Increasing Airflow and Heating Efficiency in a Multi-shelf Food Heading Device # Food dehydrator # Food dehydrator and tray for a dehydrator # Cooking system and accessories # Rapid cooking device # Convection oven # Method for rapidly cooking food # Rapid cooking device # Cooking system and accessories # Automatic bread making machine # Food dehydrator # Food Dehydrator # Electronically controlled roaster oven with digital control assembly # Coffee bean roasting apparatus = Design Patents = # Bread slicer # Convection oven # Handle for a countertop oven # Muffin holder # Convection oven # Breadmaker # Extension ring for a convection oven # Hair braiding device # Food dehydrator # Bread pan # Roaster oven with end caps # Combined roaster oven with hinged cover = Registered Trademarks = # NESCO # MONARCH # SIERRA # CLEAN-A-SCREEN # CONVERGA-FLOW # ADD-A-TRAY # OPEN COUNTRY # SNACKMASTER # GARDENMASTER # CYCLONIC COOKING # WEEKENDER # JET- STREAM OVEN # AMERICAN HARVEST # ROAST AIR OVEN # ROAST-AIR # AH AMERICAN HARVEST # NESCOTE # CIRCLE OF HEAT # NESCO # SNACKMASTER VISION # NESCO # OPEN COUNTRY # OPEN COUNTRY # GRIP 'N GO # SPA PRO # TUMBLE DRUMM # TUMBLE DRUMM FISH SCALER # NESCO AH AMERICAN HARVEST  References   External links  * NESCO * Open Country Campware Category:Manitowoc County, Wisconsin Category:Manufacturing companies based in Wisconsin ","title":"Metal Ware Corporation"},{"id":"43050631","text":"Svea Kristina Frisch (15 June 1898 in Ramsberg, √ñrebro county, Svea Kristina Frisch, 3 januari 2014, Svensk Filmdatabas - 1991), known as Kristina Lindstrand, was a Swedish actor, journalist, author, and poet.

Biography Anuryzm is a project created by Canadian guitarist John Bakhos in 2003 as a means to branch out from his background in extreme metal in favor of progressive heavy metal music. In 2010, after returning to the United Arab Emirates, Bakhos reconnected with, British vocalist Nadeem Michel Bibby, and forged the recording incarnation of Anuryzm. The band independently released their debut album Worm's Eye View in 2011.

The film was commissioned as part of the Cultural Festival accompanying the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. It was screened with live musical accompaniment on Glasgow Green on 31 July 2014.From Scotland With Love - feature documentary , Sheffield Hallam University, retrieved 4 August 2014David Pollock, Film/Album preview: From Scotland with Love, The Scotsman, 13 July 2014, retrieved 4 August 2014 It was produced by Faction North, Crossover, National Library of Scotland and Scottish Screen Archive in association with BBC Scotland and Creative Scotland.From Scotland with Love, Glasgow2014.com, retrieved 4 August 2014 The album was produced by David McAulay and released on 21 July 2014 on Domino Recording Company. Regarding the album, and its film counterpart, Anderson stated: \\"It's basically just looking at ourselves in the past ‚Äì it's like looking at your grandparents' or your great grandparents' generation goofing about, just doing what they're doing. But you have to remember that it wasn't the past for them - they were right at the cutting edge of time like we are now.\\" Released to widespread critical acclaim, the album reached number twenty-one in the UK Albums Chart; Creosote's highest charting album to date. The album also peaked at number one on the UK Record Store Chart, and at number three on the Scottish Albums Chart. Background Director Virginia Heath was commissioned to create a documentary film, featuring Scottish archive footage, to coincide with the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. Kenny Anderson was subsequently approached to craft its soundtrack, whilst recovering from a broken leg, looking forward to the birth of his child, and experiencing the potential collapse of his long-running record label, Fence. Initially hesitant, Anderson noted \\"I'm traditionally pretty bad when there's a deadline. It's not that I wouldn't deliver something, it's just that I didn't think it would be any good. They kept the Commonwealth Games out of the conversation for a while. I think they thought that once I heard the C-word I would back out all together.\\" With Anderson on board, he stated: \\"I haven't really worked with a director before, but I've had directors get in touch and ask if they can use certain songs. That's one thing when a director has their film made and they connect with something that you've written, but it's completely different when a songwriter watches a film and says, 'Oh right, I've got the song for that. [...] I just went for it and I wrote songs and passed them back to Virginia. She would go back and try to find footage that would fit it or she would reject things outright because they were too literal. So I had to hope that what I'd seen in these short films was worthy of writing a song about ‚Äì and if I'd gone off piste a bit she'd be able to go back and find things that didn't make certain lyrics stand out like a sore thumb.\\" Film The film is a 75-minute documentary created entirely from archive film material from the National Library of Scotland and Scottish Screen Archive. It is purely visual with no voiceover - only a musical soundtrack. Heath pitched for the project alongside her partner Grant Keir in response to an open call for submissions. The pair took inspiration from the similar combination of archive footage and live scoring by contemporary musicians (in that case, British Sea Power) on From the Sea to the Land Beyond. On choosing to work with King Creosote, Heath said: \\"We came to Kenny because we felt he had a great storytelling ability in his lyrics. We knew that to get across some of the complexity of the sequences we wanted, we needed someone who could translate feelings and stories into song.\\" Heath researched this material over several months, watching hundreds of films in the archive. \\"The themes are broadly love and loss, work and leisure, resistance and immigration, fighting for justice,\\" she says. \\"The big themes of the 20th century, mixed with a bit of fun and lightheartedness. It‚Äôs a universal story but with a strongly Scottish flavour, although we did try and avoid the usual clich√©s about the country.\\" Heath sent Anderson a storyboard broken down into three-minute sections showing the different storylines she wanted to pursue. She created fragments of visual material, which he responded to with music. The visuals were returned to the editing room for further development and then sent back again. It explores themes of love, loss, resistance, migration, work and play,Mark Braxton, ‚Äò‚ÄôA Century in Film: From Scotland with Love‚Äô‚Äô, Radio Times, retrieved 4 August 2014 referencing heavy industry, Scotland's shipbuilding past, the fishing industry, war, urbanisation and emigration. It also celebrates community, a good night out and a holiday by the seaside. \\"I wanted to make a film about ordinary people,\\" Heath said. \\"What really interested me was ordinary people's lives and the way people made things, were proud of making things, the sense of community.\\" Vignettes include miners smoking, couples skating on frozen rivers, a sandwich-board boy advertising Auchtermuchty Flower Show, shipworkers, children being drilled in gasmask wearing, a bombed-out classroom, the old industrial banks of the Clyde, trams going to Scotstoun and Partick, milkmen, cranes, the dead landmark of Ravenscraig steel works, tanks in George Square, and dancing at the Barrowlands. The accompanying music is judged to go with the images on screen, for example a playground motif for girls rope-skipping down the street, jaunty music for trips to the seaside, and racier sounds for a sequence on dating and nightlife. The film premiered on BBC Scotland on Sunday 22 June 2014. There were a series of live open-air screenings during the Commonwealth Games. Recording After a composing session in a studio near Loch Fyne, From Scotland with Love was recorded at Chem19 Studios, in Blantyre, Scotland, with producer David McAulay. The album also features additional production from The Delgados' Paul Savage, who had previously worked with Anderson on his studio albums, Flick the Vs (2009) and That Might Well Be It, Darling (2013). The album also features musical contributions from Admiral Fallow's Louis Abbott and Kevin Brolly, Meursault's Pete Harvey and Kate Miguda, and The Delgados' Emma Pollock. Writing and composition Upon the album's release, Kenny Anderson noted that there are references to his mother and father throughout From Scotland with Love, stating: \\"My dad's in this album a lot. There are a lot of songs on it that have little jokes in them for me, or for my dad. [...] [The song], \\"Leaf Piece\\", that comes from my mum, that's what she always called it ‚Äì 'Don't forget your leaf piece!' It's a bag of crisps, or an apple, or a cheese piece. It was a big thing, it was the first break in the day when you were [harvesting potatoes]. You couldn't wait to get your leaf piece. I think it's maybe meant to be 'leave piece' originally ‚Äì I wonder if it got Anderson- ised.\\" Regarding the track \\"For One Night Only\\", Anderson stated: \\"It was originally called \\"Fighting and Shagging\\". I found that one really hard to write. I knew we needed this upbeat, going-out song, but I can't do that. [...] I'm sure people go out a lot more now than they used to. Even my gran's generation, they'd have a sherry at New Year and that would be it. So I was thinking, big nights out must have been few and far between, and when you did go out, there would be no holding back. If your drunk character ‚Äì because everyone's got one ‚Äì could only come out once a year, it would be hugely exaggerated.\\" =Reworkings= The track \\"Miserable Strangers\\" features a reprise of the chorus from \\"678\\"; a song which previously appeared on the studio album KC Rules OK (2005). A full re-recording of \\"678\\" appears during the course of the film, and is included on the deluxe edition of From Scotland from Love. The song \\"Pauper's Dough\\" is a reworking of the song \\"Harper's Dough\\", which previously appeared on 12 O'Clock on the Dot (2000). Anderson noted: \\"The original sentiment I had for \\"Harper's Dough\\" was really personal ‚Äì it was just, you know, can you not pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. It was never a protest song, but now it is. It's one of the most powerful bits in the film. And of course, you can make these big sweeping sentiments ‚Äì Bono does it all the time ‚Äì but I don't. [...] Before it was about how I felt like the worst person ever and had to do something about myself; now it's about changing the world. Wow. And I can't take credit for that, that's down to [director] Virginia [Heath] ‚Äì the footage she used and gave me to write from.\\" Reception =Critical response= From Scotland with Love received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 81, based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

He co-founded and edited El Iris, a periodical that published the first political cartoons in Mexico, and was forced to leave the country for his political activism. Linati was also involved in revolutionary causes in Italy and Spain. He is known for his hand- colored book illustrating costumes of different types of people in Mexico. Early years Marcos Claudio Marcelo Antonio Pompeyo Blas Juan Linati y Prevost was born into a noble family in Carbonera de Parma, in the Duchy of Parma, on 1 February 1790, just after the start of the French Revolution. His father, count Filippo Linati, was active in the politics of his time. Claudio Linati was educated by the jurist Giuseppe Caderini. At the age of seventeen Claudio Linati joined the Society of Engravers of Parma. He studied lithography, a recently invented technique for printing images. In 1809 he went to Paris, where he studied painting in the studio of Jacques-Louis David. Linati also studied in the Paris studio of fellow-Italian Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli. Count Linati became an officer in the Napoleonic army. In 1810 he was imprisoned in Hungary. After his release he moved to Spain. In 1818 he returned to Parma, where he founded the Secret Society of the Sublime Perfect Master, with the goal of resisting tyranny. In 1821 Linati was in Barcelona, leading the Migueletes militia. He came to own considerable property in Catalonia. In 1823 he was taken prisoner in La Seu d'Urgell and sent as a prisoner to Mont-Louis in France. In October 1823 he was in Avignon, and soon after was in Brussels. On 9 April 1824 Linati was tried in absentia and sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Parma for conspiracy against the government. Mexico Maniere de voyager des Dames au Mexique (How Women Travel in Mexico; 1828) Linati was commissioned to survey the coast of Mexico and find an anchorage for the ships and machines of mining companies. He arrived at Alvarado, Veracruz, Mexico on 6 March 1825. This was the year in which the last Spanish stronghold in San Juan de Ul√∫a surrendered. On 22 September 1825 Linati moved to Veracruz to study lithography. In 1826 he moved to Mexico City, where the government assisted him in opening a lithography workshop. He and Gaspar Franchini installed the first lithography machine to arrive in Mexico in February 1826. Franchini died while the machine was being installed. Linati also set up a school, with pupils who included Jos√© Gracida and Ignacio Serrano. The small workshop included two presses and a collection of prints by French artists for use as examples by the students. Not long after arriving Linati made a lithograph of a map of Texas by Fiorenzo Galli. A copy of this map, the only one known to have survived, is held by the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin. Linati had come to Mexico to observe a newly independent country and to \\"civilize\\" and politicize its people. He was one of the editors of the weekly El Iris (February‚ÄìAugust 1826). His partners in this enterprise were Fiorenzo Galli and the Cuban poet Jos√© Mar√≠a Heredia. The literary periodical included lithographs depicting antiquities and modern fashions. It also provided diverse cultural content, and portraits of Guadalupe Victoria, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos and Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, heroes of the independence struggle. El Iris also included editorial content that sparked controversy. Linati was sure there would be another attempt by Spain to conquer Mexico. He and Galli became involved in the disputes between Yorkinos and Escoceses, rival groups of Freemasons. Linati took the Yorkino position that the people were sovereign, and only federalism could protect individuals and the nation against the depredations of the army and the priests. He was opposed to strong central authority and in favor of greater education in citizenship and the discipline of military service. The paper published the first Mexican political cartoon, La Tiran√≠a (Tyranny), which was attributed to Linati. El Iris demanded freedom of the press throughout Mexico. Only forty issues were printed. The political comments caused the closure of the paper and forced Linati to leave the country in 1826. Although short-lived, El Iris established a lasting model for journals that printed satirical lithographs on political and social subjects. Later years Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (1828) Linati was given a passport to return to Europe on 27 September 1826. In December 1826 he embarked on the Conveyance in Veracruz, sailing to New York City, where he stayed until 15 January 1827. He then embarked on the American ship Dawn for Antwerp, which he reached on 15 March 1827. He went on to Brussels and began work on an illustrated book about Mexico. His book of Mexican civil, military and religious costumes, with text and illustrations, was published in Belgium in 1828 and in London in 1830. On 20 August 1829 a passport was sent to Linati to return Mexico via Le Havre and the United States, but was not used immediately. It was issued by senor Gorostiza, the confidential agent of the Republic of Mexico in Brussels. In 1830 Linati was one of the members of the Paris-based Giunta Liberatrice Italian. He was involved in the unsuccessful attempts at Italian unification in 1830‚Äì31. Linati decided to return to Mexico. He arrived in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, and three days later died from yellow fever on 11 December 1832. Claudio Linati is remembered for his liberal revolutionary ideals and his artistic and historical legacy. Sir Anthony Panizzi, who knew him well, called him a man of turbulent spirit with a hardy constitution, full of energy but with no set purpose, well-read, a painter, poet and playwright. He was always interested in the manners and customs of the countries he visited. He hated England and the English, called the French servile cattle for their submission to tyranny, and said Spain was in a condition of priestly anarchy. There is a plaque on 45 Borgo Felino St, Parma, Italy, that reads: Civil, Military and Religious Costumes of Mexico Moctezuma II from the 1828 book on Costumes of Mexico Linati is renowned for his 1828 Civil, Military and Religious Costumes of Mexico (, ). This is the first inventory of types of Mexican people made by a foreigner. It is also one of the first color plate books about Mexico to be printed, with forty-eight hand-colored lithographs. The book depicts the great variety of Mexican society of the time, setting a model that would be followed by later illustrators such as Carl Nebel. The book was translated into Spanish and published in Mexico in 1956, with a foreword by Manuel Toussaint. The first plate in the book depicts Moctezuma II, a symbol of the Mexico that existed before the Europeans arrived. Linati represents Moctezuma as a strong and dignified ruler holding his scepter as a symbol of power. Linati disputes the view that the Aztecs were barbarous, asserting that human progress and civilization is universal. He compares the cruelty of the Aztec priests to the cruelty of the Roman Catholic Inquisition, both examples of the evils of superstition. Linati praises the ethnic diversity of Mexico, but writes that the indigenous people must abandon their languages and some of their customs. They must learn in schools from the Creole elite and serve in the army to become full citizens. The book shows the wealth and dignity of landowners. Linati praises the role the Creoles played in the revolution, but also makes much of Italian volunteers such as Count Giuseppe Stavoli and General Vicente Filisola who had helped in the fight for freedom, and who are depicted in several illustrations. He shows various types of soldier and praises the fighters in the insurgent movement that had recently won Mexico her independence. He also depicts the liberal heroes Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos and Guadalupe Victoria. The book includes a portrait of General Vicente Filisola. In 1836 this general would be second in command to General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna on his expedition to Texas. The book represents Mexican men and women of all stations of life. The brief essays that accompany each picture describe the costume and comment on aspects of the character depicted, often critically. Linati mocks a young female worker in a pink dress with a shawl from Puebla over her head and shoulders, explains why ancient Mexico did not develop wheat and notes the surprise a European would feel in seeing a man carrying fifty pounds of water. One picture shows an Apache chief sitting in a relaxed position on a prancing horse, showing his great skill as a rider. There are illustrations of stylishly dressed and picturesquely posed Afro-Mexican soldiers and laborers. It has been said that Linati's depictions of Afro-Mexicans were less stereotypical than others at the time, but the scenes are still romanticized. The pictures provide a valuable record of life in Mexico in the 1820s. However, they are not always reliable. The colors, added later, may vary from one copy of the book to another. Thus the picture of the Apache chief in one version shows a pale green headdress and pale blue necklace, while another version has an intense green headdress and intense blue necklace. The shield is not decorated with feathers, which would have normally been the case, in either version. In one version the coloring of the shield makes it appear to be woven like a basket rather than made from the hide of an animal.

The DT119B bogies were also almost identical to those used on the full-production Class ED72 locomotives. History A total of 22 locomotives were built by Toshiba between 1962 and 1963. The first locomotives were delivered to Moji Depot in northern Kyushu. In the late 1960s, the entire class was modified with improved braking performance for use on express freight services, and the locomotives were renumbered in the ED73 10xx series. The locomotive numbers were painted yellow at this time. In later years, the class was also used on overnight sleeping car services, as these trains did not require steam heating.

It is located along Main Street (New Hampshire Route 12), roughly between Lower Landing Road and Bridge Street, and encapsulates more than two hundred years of the town's history. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Charlestown, located on the banks of the Connecticut River in southwestern New Hampshire, was chartered as Number Four by the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1734, and rechartered by the Province of New Hampshire in 1753. Massachusetts built a fort (recreated as a museum in the Fort at Number 4, north of the district) in 1740, which was for some time the northernmost European settlement on the river. Development of Charlestown's center did not begin until 1763, when Main Street was laid out. There are ten buildings in the district which were built before 1800, including a 1772 brick schoolhouse, now a private home, and the c. 1752 Johnson House. Most of the development in central Charlestown took place in the 19th century. A number of buildings which survived a major fire in 1842 where Federal-style buildings designed by local builder Stephen Hassam, including his own house (c. 1800), the Rick's Electric building at 72 Main, and the former Connecticut River Bank building. The latter two are particularly fine examples of Federal style executed in brick. Also attributed to Hassam is the brick South Parish Unitarian Church (1842). Notable buildings of the second half of the 19th century include the Italianate Town Hall (separately listed on the National Register), and St. Luke's Episcopal Church, a wood-frame Gothic Revival structure inspired by the works of Richard Upjohn. The Silsby Free Library was built 1893-94, funded by a bequest from Ithiel Silsby, and built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style to a design by Boston, Massachusetts, architect C. C. McAlpine.

He is the only known attorney who visited Lee Harvey Oswald while Oswald was in custody by the Dallas Police Department after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.H. Louis Nichols: Dallas lawyer visited Oswald in jail, The Dallas Morning News, April 27, 2010. Biography Nichols was a graduate of the Southern Methodist University Law School, class of 1940. He was a lawyer in Dallas for over 60 years, practicing Civil Law. Nichols was a member of the American Bar Association; Texas Bar Association and other legal associations. During World War II, he served in the Army Corps of Engineers (1941‚Äì1946), and later retired from the United States Army Reserve in 1968, holding the rank of colonel.H. Louis Nichols Obituary, restland.tributes.com. Lee Harvey Oswald Nichols stated that by 2:00 pm on Saturday, November 23, 1963, he began receiving telephone calls from Dallas attorneys who were concerned that Oswald was stating he had no legal representation while being questioned by the Dallas Police Department. Oswald was being questioned at the time with regards to the assassination of President Kennedy as well as the shooting of Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippit. Law school deans were contacting the Dallas Bar Association expressing concern that \\"only a legal backwater would deny an attorney to a murder suspect\\". Nichols, who practiced civil law in the Dallas area was the president of the Dallas Bar Association at the time. In 1963, criminal suspects in Texas had no right to a lawyer while being questioned. However, Nichols was concerned and believed that Oswald needed legal representation, despite the fact that it was clear Oswald was unable to pay for an attorney to represent him. He decided to go to the Dallas Police Department and offer his services, despite the fact he was unfamiliar with criminal law. Upon arrival at the Police Department, he announced to police officials he was an attorney and was there to speak to Oswald. He was accompanied to Oswald's cell, where he found him sitting by himself between two empty adjacent cells, with a police officer just outside the door of the cell. Oswald was calm and rested in the cell with a bruise over one eye. He stated that the police were holding him \\"incommunicado\\" and denied killing either Kennedy or Officer Tippit. Oswald stated to Nichols that he wanted John Abt, an attorney from New York to represent him. Abt was associated with the American Civil Liberties Union. Nichols asked Oswald if he wanted him or a Dallas lawyer to represent him. Oswald stated \\"No, not right now.\\" Nichols then left Oswald to be alone in his cell and departed from the Dallas Police station. Nichols' visit with Oswald lasted approximately two minutes. Oswald was killed the next day by Jack Ruby.

This charter is narrated by Abu Hamza al-Thumali, a reliable and admired companion of Ali ibn al-Husayn for the first time. Risalah al-Huquq is prefaced in of the two versions by: \\"This is the treatise of Ali ibn al-Husayn to one of his companions\\", which shows to be written at the request of a pupil of him. Based on On 'Treatise of rights' that the word 'rights' is much better translated as duties, obligations or responsibilities. Sources of validity Risalah al-Huquq attributed to Imam Sajjad is mentioned in the following sources: * Tuhaf al-Oqul by Hussayn ibn Shu'bah Harrani * Al-Khisal by Shaykh Al-Suduq * Al-Amali by Shaykh Al-Suduq * Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih by Shaykh Al-Suduq The author of Tuhaf al-Oqul mentioned it without a reference, while al-Suduq writes in his al-Khisal as such: This hadith is Mursal in Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih: The Risalatul Huquq begins with \\"The greatest right of God...\\" in Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih and it does not include the introduction section in which the rights are explained in brief. The mentioned introduction exists in Tuhaf al-Oqul. Number of the rights which are discussed in both introduction section, and the detailed section (rest of the hadith which describes the rights in detail) of the hadith are 50 in Tuhaf al-Oqul while the author al-Khisal and Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih mentions 51 rights in the detailed section and an additional right called \\"right of Hajj\\" is noticeable. But there's no mention of \\"right of Hajj\\" in the introduction of the hadith in al-Khisal. Meaning of rights in Risalah al-Huquq Huquq () is plural of Haq () and is best translated as \\"rights\\". However, other words such as justice, truth, obligations, duties, responsibilities have meanings closely related to Haq. Based on On 'Treatise of rights' the word 'rights' is much better translated as duties, obligations or responsibilities.

Sand 9 developed a piezoelectric MEMS resonator to serve as an alternative for quartz timing devices in applications such as smart phones, low-power wireless devices, and communications infrastructure equipment. Sand 9 was co-founded by Pritiraj Mohanty and Matt Crowley in 2007. Vincent Graziani is the CEO. History Pritiraj Mohanty, a Boston University physicist, and Matt Crowley, former director of Boston University's technology development fund, co-founded Sand 9 in 2007. The company aimed to produce timing products with a better price-to-performance ratio than quartz in core markets. Sand 9 introduced their first two products, TM061 and TM361, on September 3, 2013. TM061 and TM361 are precision MEMS timing products for the Internet of Things and mobile devices. On November 18, 2013, the TM651 was introduced for communications infrastructure, industrial and military applications. According to EE Times, a trade publication, the TM651 is the first high-precision temperature compensated MEMS oscillator (TCMO) to meet the noise and stability demands of communication, industrial and military applications. TM061 started sampling to lead customers in November and the TM361 in December 2013. GLOBALFOUNDRIES, a semiconductor foundry, is Sand 9's foundry partner. GLOBALFOUNDRIES produces approximately one thousand 200 mm wafers per month. =Funding= Flybridge Capital led Sand 9's series A funding round in 2008. Their Series B funding raised $12 million and was reported in May 2010. In June 2012, Sand 9 raised $23 million in its series C funding round, led by Intel with participation from Vulcan capital and Analog Devices. Ericsson contributed $3 million in September 2012. Piezoelectric Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) Sand 9 developed its piezoelectric MEMS resonator technology as an alternative to quartz timing devices. Sand 9 uses aluminum nitride, a thin film that is deposited using standard semiconductor/MEMS fabrication technology, for the piezoelectric layer. The silicon MEMS products are smaller than comparable quartz devices and currently operate at fundamental frequencies up to 125 MHz. Silicon-based MEMS products can simplify system design, reduce part counts, simplify the supply chain, and improve manufacturing yields when compared to quartz. Sand 9 MEMS products can be co-packaged and overmolded with standard semiconductor ICs to eliminate the need for external timing.

She followed a soldier in the Imperial army of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, where she prostituted herself as a camp follower and was present at the Conquest of Tunis in 1535. Around 1536 she eventually settled in Rome, where she acquired a house in 1544 and became known as the most famous high class courtesan, or cortigiana onesta, of her generation. As with all courtesans of her class, she had a main client, in her case Roberto Strozzi. Other clients included Cardinal Carafa, the Marquis de Montebello, Cardinal Farnese and author Matteo Bandello. According to Pierre Brantome, she was herself a client of one of her colleagues, Pandora, reputed to be one of the most beautiful in Rome, whom she paid for sexual services. A famous incident took place on a party, were Rocco Biancalana lost a bet to her after he had promised to make her blush, but in which she instead won the bet. Isabella de Luna was portrayed in two contemporary novels by Matteo Bandello. One of which was Lives of Gallant Ladies. =Transgresions= In 1555 de Luna was accused of holding a child captive in her house. Before being arrested she fled. She was captured in Rimini whilst on her way to Venice and returned to Rome's Castel Sant'Angelo to await trial. Two years later, in 1557 she was a witness at the trial of Roman nobleman Pompeo Giustini. During an official crackdown on morality, de Luna and Pandora were arrested and the Pope threatened to burn them at the stake. On another occasion she faced imprisoned for debt but managed to pay the merchant she owed the money before she was incarcerated.

The main house of Rosemont burned in 1930. The Cunninghams sold it after that. The site is largely wooded, but there are architectural remains of seven structures and some formal gardens. At one time there were at least 17 buildings and activity areas, including vegetable and flower gardens, a race track, separate living quarters for the adult Cunningham daughter in the 19th century, and other facilities. An archeological survey was done in 1992 by Historic Landscape and Garden Design, and Chicora Foundation, Inc., both of Columbia, South Carolina, for the Laurens County Historical Society.

Description and history The Claremont Warehouse No. 34 is located about west of Claremont's central Tremont Square, between Main Street and Heritage Place. It is a tall building, four stories in height, with an irregular four-sided footprint about long and ranging in width from . When built, the structure had an open interior with a single floor and three mezzanine levels, with a tall three-story opening at one end, and was covered by a sawtooth roof. The building was designed by Arthur S. Coffin and built in 1912 by the Sullivan Machinery Company, a local manufacturer of quarrying and mining equipment. It was used primarily as a warehouse until 1967, also including a welding shop for a time. A rail line ran directly into the building, facilitating the loading and unloading of materials. It was purchased in 1974 by a mattress manufacturer. A large portion of the adjacent Sullivan Company plant (located between this building and the Sugar River) was destroyed by fire in 1979. It has since been converted to residential use.

Early life Inamujandi was born in the mid-nineteenth century in a remote region near Ndora Mountain in northeast Burundi, in the modern province of Cibitoke. Her early life is otherwise obscure, but she belonged to a long tradition of female prophets associated with the shrines of deceased Burundian kings. Involvement in 1934 revolt Inamujandi played an important role in fomenting the 1934 rebellion against Belgian colonial rule in Burundi. The colonial authorities had replaced the young king Mutaga Mbikije with Baranyanka, to which action Inamujandi was strongly opposed, particularly as Baranyanka was a Tutsi in a predominantly Hutu area. Under her instigation, and inspired by her invocation of the demi-God Kiranga, the population of Ndora revolted in an attempt to restore the pre-colonial order. Such was Inamujandi's ability to motivate her people that she was rumoured to have magical powers. A Belgian government report described her as \\"a sorceress by the name of Mujande. She announced the coming of a new king,\\" while eyewitnesses said that she claimed that anyone \\"who called himself Tutsi or mzungu (European) would be spat upon by the new king and would perish.\\" She reportedly told her followers that the bullets of colonial forces would turn into grain or water, and that the trees themselves would eat their enemies. The rebels under her guidance set fire to more than three hundred huts and ten mission schools within a matter of days. However, the revolt was soon crushed by Force Publique troops. She was captured in on 6 November 1934, and was sent into exile Ruyigi in the east of the country, where she likely died shortly afterwards. Legacy Inamujandi's name was frequently invoked by Hutu partisans in the 1950s and 60s, and successive Burundian governments have presented her as an anti-colonial role model.

The United States Custom House (also known as the Old Customs House)\\"San Ysidro Land Port of Entry Improvements Project Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement Volume I\\", U.S. General Services Administration in San Ysidro, San Diego, California, is a 1933 Spanish Revival building located north of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places with the full historic name U.S. Inspection Station/U.S. Custom House and common name U.S. Custom House. History The Custom House was part of a large federal building program begun in 1926 during the Herbert Hoover administration in which 1,300 new federal buildings were constructed. The building was designed by the Supervising Architect's office of the Treasury Department; construction was performed by Robert E. McKee of El Paso, Texas, who was paid $93,800.Nomination form for the National Register of Historic Places for the U.S. Inspection Station/U.S. Custom House, National Park Service Groundbreaking was in early summer 1932. In May 1933 the building was complete; it was quietly put into use without a formal dedication ceremony. As traffic increased at the crossing over the decades, an additional building was added north of the 1933 facility. That new building was then replaced by much larger inspection and customs facilities to its west, completed in 1974 and still in use. After a period during which the ground floor of the Custom House was left empty, the ground floor once again houses offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Significance The building is considered important for two reasons, one political and one architectural. Politically, the building has played an important symbolic role in relations between Mexico and the United States at one of the busiest land border crossings in the world. Architecturally, it is considered a locally prominent example of the Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style as applied to a public building.

It covers a wide range of applications, such as pumps, water turbines, pump inducers, and fuel cavitation in orifices as commonly encountered in fuel injection systems.  Modelling categories  Modelling efforts can be divided into two broad categories: vapor transport models and discrete bubble models. = Vapor transport model = Vapor transport models are best suited to large-scale cavitation, like sheet cavitation that often occurs on rudders and propellers. These models include two-way interactions between the phases. = Discrete bubble model = The discrete bubble model includes the effects of the surrounding fluid on the bubbles. Discrete bubble models, e.g. the Rayleigh- Plesset, Gilmore and Keller-Miksis, describe the relation between the external pressure, bubble radius and the velocity and acceleration of the bubble wall.  Two-phase modeling  Two-phase modeling is the modelling of the two phases, as in a free surface code. Two common types of two phase models are homogeneous mixture models and sharp interface models. The difference between both the models is in the treatment of the contents of cells containing both phases. = Homogeneous mixture models = Most recent cavitation modelling efforts have used homogeneous mixture models, in which the contents of individual cells are assumed to be uniform. This approach is best suited to modeling large numbers of bubbles that are much smaller than one cell. The disadvantage of this approach is that when the cavities are larger than one cell, the vapor fraction is diffused across neighboring cells by the vapor transport model. This is different from the sharp interface models in that the vapor and liquid are modeled as distinct phases separated by an interface. = Sharp interface models = In sharp interface models, the interface is not diffused by advection. The model maintains a sharp interface. Naturally, this is only appropriate when the bubble size is at least on the order of a few cells.  Phase change models  Phase change models represent the mass transfer between the phases. In cavitation, pressure is responsible for the mass transfer between liquid and vapor phases. This is in contrast to boiling, in which the temperature causes the phase change. There are two general categories of phase change models used for cavitation: the barotropic models and equilibrium models. This section will briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type. = Barotropic model = If the pressure is greater than vapor pressure, then the fluid is liquid, otherwise vapor. This means density of liquid water is considered as the density of fluid if the pressure is greater than vapor pressure and the density of water vapor is considered when pressure is less than vapor pressure of water at the ambient temperature. = Equilibrium model = The equilibrium model requires the solution of the energy equation. The equation for state of water is used, with the energy absorbed or released by phase change creating local temperature gradients which control the rate of phase change.  Bubble dynamics models  Several models for the bubble dynamics have been proposed: =Rayleigh= The Rayleigh model is the oldest, dating from 1917. This model was derived by Lord Rayleigh It describes an empty space in the water, influenced by a constant external pressure. His assumption of an empty space led to the name cavity still used. The Rayleigh equation, derived from the Navier-Stokes equation for a spherically symmetric bubble convected with the flow with constant external pressure, reads :R\\\\ddot{R} +\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\dot{R}^2 =\\\\frac{p(R)-p_\\\\infty}{\\\\rho_L} =Rayleigh-Plesset= Building on the work of Lord Rayleigh, Plesset included the effects of viscosity, surface tension and a non-constant external pressure to the equation. This equation reads :R\\\\ddot{R} +\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\dot{R}^2 =\\\\frac{p_i-p_\\\\infty-\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma}{R}- \\\\frac{4\\\\mu}{R}\\\\dot{R}}{\\\\rho_L} =Gilmore= The equation by Gilmore accounted for the compressibility of the liquid. In its derivation, the viscous term is only present as a product with the compressibility. This term is neglected. The resulting term is: : (1-\\\\frac{\\\\dot{R}(t)}{c(R)})R(t)\\\\ddot{R}(t) +\\\\frac{3}{2}(1-\\\\frac{\\\\dot{R}(t)}{3c(R)})\\\\dot{R}^2(t) =(1+\\\\frac{\\\\dot{R}(t)}{c(R)})H(R)+(1-\\\\frac{\\\\dot{R}}{c(R)})\\\\frac{R}{c(R)}\\\\dot{H}(R) In which: :H = \\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\frac{p_\\\\infty(t)+B}{\\\\rho_L}\\\\left[ (\\\\frac{P+B}{p_\\\\infty(t) +B})^{\\\\frac{n-1}{n}}-1\\\\right] :c = c_0\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_{g}(t) -2\\\\sigma /R+B}{p_\\\\infty (t)+B}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{n-1}{2n}} :\\\\dot{H} = \\\\frac{D}{p_{\\\\infty}(t)+B} H-\\\\frac{D}{\\\\rho} (\\\\frac{P+B}{p_{\\\\infty}(t)+B}) ^ {\\\\frac{n-1}{n}}+\\\\frac{\\\\dot{R}}{\\\\rho_L R} \\\\left[\\\\frac{p_{\\\\infty}(t)+B}{P+B}\\\\right] ^{\\\\frac{1}{n}} \\\\left[\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma}{R} -3k p_{g}(t)\\\\right] =Others= Over the years, several other models have been developed by making different assumptions in the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations.

Life  Janeway was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on 19 March 19th 1873, and died at his home in Riverdale-on-Hudson, New York on 1 February 1921. Janeway was the son of LTC Jacob Jones Janeway (1840 - 1926), a successful New Jersey wallpaper manufacturer and philanthropist, and Eliza A Harrington Janeway (1843 - 1925). He married Elizabeth Ayers Buckley and they had five children. Elizabeth was the daughter of Dr. Lucius Duncan Buckley and Katherine La Rue Mellick. He was educated in the Rutgers Preparatory School and graduated from Rutgers College in 1889 followed by post-graduate courses at Sheffield Scientific School, Yale University under Professor Russell Henry Chittenden. Then followed four years in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, after which (1898) he entered Roosevelt Hospital in the surgical division under Charles McBurney. He studied in the clinics of Roosevelt, Skin and Cancer and Lying-in Hospitals. His first five years were given to general practice in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 1907 he became associated with his father-in-law, Dr. Bulkley, in his dermatological practice. He remained with him for two years, and during that time made investigations in skin and cancer pathology and wrote articles upon this subject. In 1909 he was appointed chief of the Laboratory for Experimental Research of Physicians and Surgeons. He did work in blood-pressure, shock and in surgery of the oesophagus and stomach. In 1914 he was appointed Attending Surgeon and Chief of the Radium Department at Memorial Hospital, New York City, where he developed and advanced the use of radium as a therapeutic agent. Janeway's work with radium in uterine cancer was most notable. He was the first man in this country to advocate radium as the agent of choice in cervical carcinoma; the technique of burying radium emanation in the cervix was original with him and, in fact, all his work with radium emanation needles was primarily original. His work on conservative surgery plus radium was early recognized. Various procedures, such as the use of dental-modeling compound for improving technique in applying radium, originated in his clinic.This section is sourced from Radium (March 1921). \\"Dr. Henry H. Janeway\\", Vol. 16, No. 6, pp. 81‚Äì82 Publications Janeway's clinical and experimental observations were published in medical journals of his time. His report on Radium Therapy in Cancer, at the Memorial Hospital (1915-1916), which appeared in book form in 1917 was the most comprehensive work of its type published in the United States. Its first chapter, \\"Physical Considerations Relative to the Application of Radium\\", was written by Gioacchino Failla. Janeway's 1919 paper on \\"The Treatment of Uterine Carcinoma\\" was considered a classic and was written while he was Attending Surgeon and Head of the Radium Department at Memorial Hospital in New York.

The Janeway Medal and Lectures Janeway Medal (front) In 1933, the American Radium Society founded the annual Janeway Lecture in his honor. The lecturers are chosen for their \\"outstanding scientific contributions\\" with the lecture taking place at the society's annual general meeting. The first Janeway Lecture, \\"Early Experience in Radium Therapy\\" was given by the pathologist James Ewing. Since 1937 each Janeway Lecturer is also presented with the Janeway Medal, originally struck in bronze but in 1971 changed to gold.American Radium Society. Janeway Lectures The medal was designed by Edward H. Skinner, the American Radium Society's president-elect at the time, and Stephanie Prince, a young artist from Kansas City, Missouri. The design is based on Norse mythology and depicts Odin standing before the giant Mimir seeking to drink from the well of knowledge. The obverse depicts the ravens Hugin (Reflection) and Munin (Remembrance) which became the symbol of the American Radium Society. =Janeway Lectures= * 2014 Murray F.

The law covers employees who receive wages for work performed in compliance with an employer, not including freelancers and employees working for the state. A new law was passed on 25 January 2018 by the Danish Parliament. It consists of a new concept of concurrent holidays and includes a transition period from 1 September 2019 ‚Äì 31 August 2020 before being implemented on 1 September 2020. The concept of concurrent holidays allows employees to earn 2.08 holiday days each month, which they have access to use immediately, as opposed to the old scheme where workers earned holiday days for the following year.  Danish Law  The Danish Holiday Act is administered by the Agency for Retention and Recruitment (Styrelsen for Fastholdelse og Rekruttering), which is part of the Ministry of Labour () and by a range of other authorities, including the holiday pay scheme, FerieKonto. A number of the provisions of the act may be waived under collective bargaining. The agency supports the Minister for Employment and the Danish Parliament with employment-related decisions that impact both citizens and businesses. The agency was founded in January 2014 to replace and combine two former agencies, The Labour Market Agency (Arbejdsmarkedsstyrelsen) and The Agency for Retention and Recruitment (Styrelsen for Fastholdelse og Rekruttering). The agency deals with employment decisions locally, regionally and nationally. The agency is split into 15 different offices, all focusing on different aspects of their overall responsibilities. = Relation to EU = Denmark has been a member of the European Union since 1973. Countries part of the EU are legally required to implement EU law in national law. This includes holiday time and other aspects, like maternity leave, parental leave, sick leave, other leave etc. The European commission deals with adapting and adopting new laws, in which anyone affected by the law can contribute to. After new laws are implemented, a commission ensures that all members are abiding by these policies. If countries fail to comply within a deadline set by the commission, infringement procedures may commence. The law in Denmark implements part of European Union directive 93/104/EC of 1993, for example Article 7, which states: > Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker > is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks in accordance with > the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by > national legislation and/or practice.Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 > November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organization of working time > at Eur-Lex.  History  227x227px The Holiday Act was established on 13 April 1938, giving workers‚Äô the right to two weeks of paid holiday. The law progressed into the creation of the organisation, ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Holiday‚Äô (), which was created to support and provide holiday opportunities for workers. Employees were granted holidays, so this organization was established to ensure they had somewhere to take them. They developed holiday towns (Esbjerg, Gilleleje, Middlefart, Karreb√¶ksminde, Marielyst) and constructed hotels throughout several cities in Denmark. The establishment of the law and the People‚Äôs Holiday organization meant that workers received time off and pay, which could both be spent at various holiday destinations throughout Denmark. By 1979, paid holiday days had increased to five weeks. The most recent amendment to the act was to comply with the European Union legislation. The Danish Parliament formulated the amendments in 2018, to be set into action in 2020, which included the implementation of a transitional arrangement commencing in 2019. The previous law did not conform to international standards because not all workers in Denmark received five weeks of paid holiday. Under the previous regulation, workers earned holiday days for the succeeding holiday year. Inconsistent with EU legislation, employees new to the Danish working market, did not have any earned days of holiday to take their first year of employment.  Concurrent Holidays  470x470px As of 1 September 2020, the holiday scheme in Denmark will conform to the concept of concurrent holidays. Employees in Denmark will accumulate 2.08 days of paid holiday each month (a total of five weeks each year) which, authorized by the new amendment, can be used immediately. Employees will accumulate holiday days over 12 months (1 September ‚Äì 31 August) and have 16 months (1 September ‚Äì 31 December) to use at least four weeks of them. Employees should use fifteen days consecutively, equivalent to a three-week holiday during the main holiday period () from 1 May till 30 September. 468x468px Under the legislation, employees can decide to trade their holiday days for pay. This is allowed if in agreed upon with their employer and relates only to the fifth and additional sixth week () of holiday (which is not covered by the Holiday Act). If the employee meets the required guidelines, in terms of the amount and where the money stems from, they can trade their holiday days for pay at the end of the holiday year by filling out a form on the governmental website, Borger.dk. Specific rules and procedures are typically found in the employment contracts or company handbooks.  Holiday Pay  The Danish Holiday Act enables employees to receive a wage during their five-week holiday. Employees either receive no deductions in pay when they are on holiday (paid holiday) or 12.5% of their annual pay (holiday allowance or ). Employees on paid holiday, receiving their normal income, also receive an additional bonus () of 1% of their income. These employees can choose to receive holiday allowance instead, at a rate of 12% of their annual pay without any bonus. Holiday allowance is transferred to employees via different funds (e.g. FerieKonto or Feriepengeinfo) or directly from the employer. Employers make regular payments into the employees‚Äô holiday account through the fund. The fund then distributes the money once the employee has applied for their allowance. This is done at least one month prior to their holiday via the government website, Borger.dk. The earliest they receive their allowance from the fund is 1 May and one month before their holiday. If the employee resigns or is dismissed, they are still entitled to their accumulated holiday days and holiday pay. Paid holiday employees will receive their payment from the fund by applying via the government website, Borger.dk.  Transition Period  To implement the new holiday scheme, a transition period (1 September 2019 ‚Äì 31 August 2020) was imposed. This was to ensure that employees do not accumulate double the amount of holiday days during the switch. The holidays earned throughout the transition period by employees will be kept in a new fund (L√∏nmodtagernes Dyrtidsfond) and disbursed once the employee leaves the labour market. This includes retirement, death, early retirement and leaving Denmark. The holiday period will commence 1 May 2020 until 31 August 2020 during the transition period, and the 16.64 days obtained from 1 January 2019 to 31 August 2019 can be claimed then. Any holiday days not used will be carried over to the new scheme. = Employees new to the working market during the transition period = Employers entering the labour market during the transition period are eligible for ‚Äòfund holidays‚Äô () if they meet below prerequisites: * They have accumulated less than 8.3 paid days of holiday from 1 January 2019 until 31 August 2019; * Have received wage from 1 September 2019 to 31 December 2019 The ‚Äòfund holidays‚Äô allow those employers access to 8.3 paid holiday days in addition to their accumulated holiday, which can be used during the holiday period in the transition phase (1 May 2020 ‚Äì 31 August 2020). The additional fund holiday allowances are disbursed from the new fund (L√∏nmodtagernes Dyrtidsfond) in the holiday period rather than with retirement.  Employment Termination  Employees terminating their employment contract need to inform their employer prior. The time of notice depends on how long they worked for the company. The employer is required to pay the holiday money for the vacation days not used before the employee stops permanently. Employees terminating their contract are only allowed to spend 25 days of holiday during the holiday year. Any transferred days of holiday will need to be disbursed as payment before the employee leaves the job. If the employee terminates their employment contract due to retirement, they can receive all of their accumulated holiday as payment if they additionally receive pension from the state (not including early pension ()). If the employee receives holiday pay, the employer can disburse the accumulated holiday money directly. If the employee works during their retirement, they need to use their holiday days in order to get their holiday money.  Prevented From Taking Vacation  = Sick before the holiday = If the employee becomes ill before they start their holiday, they are required to inform their employer of their situation immediately. The days spent sick on their holiday can be used at a later stage. If the employee recovers throughout the holiday, they can decide to come back to work (and use the whole holiday later) or use the remainder of their holiday days. They should update their employer with their decision. If their employer requests a medical certificate and the employee became sick before their holiday, the employer is liable for the costs. = Sick during the holiday = Employees that fall ill during their holiday can receive five replacement holiday days per year if they meet the following criteria: * informed their employer of their illness; * they have a medical certificate, obtained at their expense; * they have been ill for more than five holiday days throughout the year. Any replacement holiday days not used within the holiday period will be transferred to the following year. = Maternity, paternity or adoption leave = Employees on maternity, paternity or adoption leave accumulate holiday days if they receive wages from their employer on the leave and they are not getting maternity unemployment benefits from the state. They are not allowed to take a holiday during their leave. Employees prevented from taking their holiday due to their leave, can receive their accumulated holiday as payment or transfer their holiday days to the following holiday period if in agreement with their employer. = Moving abroad = If the employee moves abroad, terminating the employment contract in Denmark, they can receive their accumulated holiday days as payment. If the employee continues to work for their Danish corporation under the Danish Holiday Act, they will not receive their holiday days as a payment. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are not covered by the Danish Holiday Act, and therefore, Danish employees moving there to work will get their holiday disbursed as payment. = Other reasons = * Self-employed * Position of trust (i.e. mayor or minister) * In prison or another closed institution * Involved in legal employment conflict * Completing military services * In dispute about holiday allowance and filed a claim * Leave of absence to care for a sick or dying relative * 'Stay-at-home' position If the employee is prevented from taking their holiday due to any of the above reasons, they can get their holiday days paid out. If the employee was prevented from taking their main holiday (three weeks between 1 May and 30 September), they can receive up to three weeks of holiday as payment. If the employee was prevented from taking their full holiday, they can receive their full holiday as payment. Employees need to apply to have their holiday disbursed as payment via the government website, Borger.dk.  Additional Sixth Week (Feriefridage)  Depending on occupation and whether an employee is working for the public or private sector, some workers receive an additional sixth week of paid holiday (). This is not included in the Danish Holiday Act but rather is part of the workers‚Äô employment contract. People employed full time by the state or municipality (public sector) receive the sixth week of paid holiday. They have the option to use the days of holiday, have them transferred to the next holiday year or have their holiday pay paid out. Employment contracts state the terms and formalities, including when notice is required before going on holiday, and whether the employer can decline the requested holiday, etc.  Public Holidays  Employees do not have to work on public holidays in Denmark unless otherwise stated in their contract. This refers to holidays that occur throughout the working week, Monday to Friday. If the public holiday falls on a non-working day (weekend), it is not moved to the next working day, and employees do not receive any time off for the holiday. The following occasions are classified as public holidays in Denmark: * New Year‚Äôs Day * Maundy Thursday () * Good Friday () * Easter Monday () * Great Prayer Day () * Ascension Day () * Whit Monday () * Christmas Day () * Boxing Day () Holiday or half days may also be given by different industries for the following days, not classified as national holidays but celebrated nationally: * 1 May * Constitution Day () * Christmas Eve Employees typically do not receive holiday allowance on public holidays unless otherwise stated in their employment contract.

The USCC was the reference center for all 50 US states and US territories, protectorates, and districts: the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. The USCC was also the reference Center for the following countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guam, Guyana, Jamaica, Japan, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. The USCC discontinued on February 7, 2018. Historical overview In the United States, there have been four Cochrane Centers since the start of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 1993. The Baltimore Cochrane Center was launched soon after the launch of the Collaboration, officially in 1994, with Kay Dickersin as Director. The San Francisco Cochrane Center was launched soon thereafter, in 1996, with Lisa Bero and Drummond Rennie as Co-Directors. The San Antonio Cochrane Center launched in 1994, with Cynthia Mulrow as Director, and the New England Cochrane Center launched in 1996 with Joseph Lau and Alexia Anczack-Bouckoms as co-Directors. In 1998, Kay Dickersin moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and with the move the Baltimore Cochrane Center was renamed the New England Cochrane Center, Providence Office. The US centers had variable luck with obtaining sufficient infrastructure funding, and The San Antonio Cochrane Center closed in 2000. In December 2002, the remaining three centers (the New England Cochrane Center at Boston, the New England Cochrane Center at Providence, and the San Francisco Cochrane Center) merged to form a single registered entity with three offices, the US Cochrane Center (the USCC). The Providence office became the first point of contact for the work of The Cochrane Collaboration in the United States and assumed responsibility for fulfilling the core Center functions. In 2005, Kay Dickersin returned to Baltimore, to take up a post at Johns Hopkins University, and the USCC moved with her. The New England Cochrane Center Boston Office closed in February, 2008. In approximately 2006, Drummond Rennie moved out of the area, leaving his post as SF Branch Director, and Lisa Bero became the Center Director. In June 2014, the San Francisco Branch of the United States (US) Cochrane Center changed its name to the West Coast Branch of the US Cochrane Center, and because of Lisa Bero‚Äôs emigration to Australia, a new Branch Director was announced, Mark Helfand located at Oregon Health and Science University. On February 7, 2018, the USCC closed its doors. Main Tasks # Supporting Cochrane entities with a coordinating base in the US or one of the countries serviced by the Center. These include: Review Groups, Fields, and Methods Groups. # Supporting new Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs), Fields, and Methods Groups who want to register with the Collaboration. # Supporting individuals who seek information about and participation in the work of the Collaboration. Offices =The USCC Main Office in Baltimore= The USCC main office in Baltimore was responsible for providing training and support for review authors, trials search coordinators (TSCs), review group coordinators (RGCs), editors, handsearchers, consumers, healthcare providers, policy makers, and others. In addition the main office of the USCC worked with international colleagues to provide training and support for others in the Collaboration who were responsible for training. =CENTRAL= Each Cochrane Center is responsible for a unique function within the Cochrane Collaboration. For twelve years (1994 to 2005) the Baltimore Cochrane Center, and subsequently NECC@P, was responsible for coordinating CENTRAL, The Cochrane Collaboration‚Äôs central register of controlled clinical trials. CENTRAL was designed for use by members of the Collaboration‚Äôs review groups and others performing systematic reviews. CENTRAL serves both as a repository for trial reports identified by members of the Collaboration and as a source of trial reports from which Review Groups build their specialized registers. In late 1992, work began on development of a register of reports of controlled trials for use in conducting systematic reviews. The first meeting was held and the eligibility criteria were decided at the Cochrane Workshop on ‚ÄúBuilding a Register of RCTs‚Äù at Green College, Oxford, United Kingdom, November 8, 1992 and was attended by Iain Chalmers, Carol Lefebrvre and Kay Dickersin, among others. Definitions and eligibility criteria were decided then that continue to be used to this day. Although the individuals interested in and key to the developments leading to international registers of randomized controlled trials were also leaders in the Cochrane Collaboration, a larger and more centralized group was felt to be a better location for a common resource. Accordingly, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and specifically the U.S. National Library of Medicine were approached about a partnership. The National Institutes of Health convened a meeting in December 1993 to consider the importance of registers of controlled trials for the promotion of evidence- based health care. One of the outcomes of that meeting was an agreement by National Library of Medicine to retag existing MEDLINE records of reports of RCTs and CCTs, identified by Cochrane collaborators and not already tagged as such, with the publication types (PTs) RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL (RCT[PT]) and CONTROLLED-CLINICAL-TRIAL (CCT[PT]). The USCC conducted the ‚ÄúMEDLINE Retagging Project‚Äù from 1994-2005 by submitting to MEDLINE all CCTs and RCTs it had identified that were not yet tagged RCT/PT or CCT/PT in MEDLINE. It identified these publications in two ways: (1) collecting on a quarterly basis all CCT and RCT reports newly identified via handsearching by the approximately 50 Cochrane review groups, and (2) identifying all CCTs and RCTs not already identified as such on MEDLINE using electronic search methods. CENTRAL was then created using two sources of information about published trial reports, periodic download of all records in MEDLINE tagged as RCTPT and CCTPT and submission of non-MEDLINE eligible citations (e.g., conference abstracts identified through handsearching) by the centers and review groups. After 1994, when the new publication type tags were initiated, reports of trials missed by NLM‚Äôs MEDLINE indexing grew smaller with each year and the NLM decided not to fund the retagging Program after 2005. For the 1994-2005 time period, CENTRAL was funded mainly by the National Library of Medicine, and also by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The Packard Foundation, and the European Union Biomedical and Health Research Programmes I and II. Some trials are still missed by the MEDLINE indexers however, and searches of other electronic bibliographic databases are required, so the effort to make CENTRAL a comprehensive database of studies possibly eligible for Cochrane reviews continues. Since 2005, development of CENTRAL has been conducted by Cochrane and John Wiley and Sons, publishers of The Cochrane Library. =US Cochrane West= The West Coast Affiliate Center operates out of Oregon Health & Science University and University of California, San Francisco. It develops guidance for systematic reviews of complex interventions and realist reviews of health policies. =The Caribbean Branch of the USCC (CBUSCC)= The CBUSCC is the reference center for English- speaking Caribbean territories.

Life  A member of the Aspietes family, of noble Armenian origin, Alexios Aspietes was probably a relative of the generals Michael Aspietes and Constantine Aspietes, who were active in the late 12th century. Alexios Aspietes first appears in 1195, when he was governor of the town of Serres, and was ordered by Emperor Alexios III Angelos to march against the Bulgarian‚ÄìVlach rebellion of the brothers Peter and Ivan Asen. In the event, in the summer or autumn of the same year, Aspietes and his army were defeated by the rebels, who took many prisoners, including Aspietes himself. Aspietes disappears from record for the next decade but was apparently released from captivity since in 1205 he is mentioned as being in Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv in Bulgaria). In the aftermath of the crushing victory by the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan over the forces of the Latin Empire at the Battle of Adrianople on 14 April, the mostly Byzantine Greek citizenry of Philippopolis rose up in opposition to the imminent conquest of their city by Kaloyan, and proclaimed Aspietes as emperor. Kaloyan immediately turned his army on the city, and after a brief resistance, the inhabitants were forced to surrender on terms in June. Kaloyan, however, enraged by the Greeks' collusion with the Latins, did not keep his word and executed the city's leaders, including Aspietes who, according to Niketas Choniates, was first left hanging upside down before being dismembered and thrown into a ravine to be eaten by the vultures.

Alia Shawkat, Aubrey Plaza, Frank Langella, and Ciar√°n Hinds also appear in supporting roles. The film is based on the 2006 novel of the same title by Tom Drury, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sluser. Plot An offbeat metaphysical story told in a non-linear fashion that is in equal parts about fate, love, dreams, unfulfilled potential, coming-of-age and life in a small town. A young man named Pierre Hunter (Anton Yelchin) falls in love with a mysterious woman named Stella (Zooey Deschanel) and finds himself in a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with a somewhat idiotic but, nonetheless, capable and violent criminal named Shane (John Hawkes). A college graduate turned bartender, Pierre, comes home after his parents death. Shane picks up Pierre, hitching whilst carrying a rose-bush, after his MG car breaks down, then charges Pierre $20 for the privilege and kicks him out of his vehicle further down the road, stealing his rose-bush. A chucked rock, taken out of his pocket and hurled by an outraged Pierre, sets Shane to crash out cold on the next curve as he drives off. As Pierre inspects the scene, he finds a $77,000 bag of money in Shane's truck. Shane wakes up from the crash and steals the car from the lady who stopped to help him. Pierre is going to give his new found money to a woman (who once gave him her lucky rock!) who needs plastic surgery for a badly scarred face. He feels the money is destined for her, since she told him as she gifted him said rock that she could only ever get the needed surgery \\"if she ever found a pile of money.\\" Meanwhile, walking through a field, Pierre falls into a well and is rescued by Stella. Pierre feels indebted to her for saving his life, then goes on to fall in love with her. Stella is a ghost, inadvertently killed whilst housesitting, in an arson fire set sometime before by Shane on his brother's orders, believing the house empty. Tim Geer is helping Stella deal with her situation and get retribution for a life stolen. (They also seem aware of Pierre's imminent fate, one which Stella hopes to spare him.) Shane, his brother Ned, and Lyle come to Driftless to get back their money. Eventually they catch up to Pierre, who leads the trio into a trap. Over a disagreement at their predicament, short-tempered Shane shoots Lyle through the heart. In a shootout Shane and Pierre kill each other. As Shane lies dying Stella appears to him and questions her killing, then comforts Pierre through his last breath. Pierre seemingly knew he was going to die as he wrote a will giving his car to his friend, Carrie, his grey felt hat to Keith and his binoculars to Stella. Pierre wakes up on a beach and is greeted by Stella. She explains they are going to have a lot of time together... (just as he had wished for before.)

Early life Wynne was born in 1780, the son of the MP Charles Finch. and Jane Wynne who had married one another in 1778. The Wynne family had been producing members of parliament for Caernarvonshire since at least as far back as the mid-seventeenth century. He received his education at Westminster School and at Brasenose College, Oxford, which he left at the end of 1797 after only about six months, possibly in connection with his parents‚Äô separation. He was later a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford between 1800 and 1812. He took the names Griffith and Wynne by royal licence on 26 June 1804, almost certainly in order to inherit from his mother's family the Wynne family estates surrounding Voelas House (subsequently demolished) in Denbighshire. Career He was politically active in the Caernarvonshire constituency from about 1825, and was elected unopposed as the constituency MP in 1830 when the king's death triggered a general election. He was considered a partisan of the Tory government, but was absent from the House of Commons when the government fell a few months later, in November 1830, over the issue of parliamentary reform. There is no record of his having made a speech in the House of Commons. His voting record in the struggle that marked the run up to the Reform Act 1832 was opposed to the reform agenda of the Whig government of Lord Grey. However, for much of the time he was absent due to illness, and he did not stand for election in the 1832 election, nor subsequently. Personal Wynne married Sarah Hildyard in 1812. Their children included Charles Griffiths Wynne-Finch (1815‚Äì1874) and Charlotte Griffith-Wynne, better remembered in New Zealand as Charlotte Godley (1821‚Äì1907), the wife of John Robert Godley. His youngest daughter Frances Elizabeth Wynne travelled widely and was a keen amateur artist. Another child included their son, John Wynne, who played first-class cricket. Griffith-Wynne became estranged from John in 1864, disinheriting him from his will. Charles Wynn Griffith-Wynne died on 22 March 1865.

History  After the Second World War, with the installation of a new government in Iraq, the situation of the Jews in Iraq deteriorated. After prominent members of the Jewish community such as Laura Khozoee were arrested, and Shafiq Adas, a successful Jewish businessman, was hanged, many Iraqi Jews decided to emigrate. Some left for Israel while others decided to settle in Iran. They reached Iran with the help of Kurdish Jews and many arrived at Khorramshahr. With the help of Harun Abdolnabi, a prominent Jew in Khorramshahr, some were able to go to Tehran and obtain legal documents. From 1946 to 1951 many Iraqi Jews moved to Tehran, while others moved to Europe and the United States. At this time, with the help of Iranian Jews, the Iraqi Jews decided to create a cultural center. In 1946 Meir Abdullah Batson bought a large piece of land with an area of over near the University of Tehran, in Ghods Street. He separated a piece of land of over and turned it into a synagogue, with the help of Saleh and Davood Mashi, Heskel Haim, and others. The community wanted to name the synagogue after Meir Abdullah, but the government did not accept it because he was a foreign citizen. Hence the name \\"Ettefagh\\" was chosen, and it became the main place of gathering for the Iraqi Jews of Tehran. The synagogue architecture was designed in the style of Babylonian architecture, and it was fitted with the most advanced cooling system of the time. Most of the Torah scrolls in the synagogue were brought by the Jews who came from Iraq, and a Babylonian Talmud in Aramaic script was dedicated to the synagogue. Many Iraqi Jews emigrated from Iran during the Iranian revolution, and today only a few families (mainly Iranian Jews) still use the synagogue.http://etefagh.ir/moarefi.asphttp://www.7dorim.com/Tasavir/kenisa_etefag.asp  References  Category:Synagogues in Tehran ","title":"Ettefagh Synagogue"},{"id":"43051971","text":"Sir Rowland Alston, 4th Baronet (1679 ‚Äì 2 January 1759) of Odell, Bedfordshire, was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1722 to 1741.

Hill walking There are a number of routes to the summit; one of the most popular ascents starts from the forest car park at Ballycuggaran, Ogonnelloe. The route passes through one of the conifer plantations that have been created on the shoulder of the mountain and other nearby hills by Coillte, the state owned forestry company. The route then follows part of the long-distance path known as the East Clare Way which runs in a circular route from Killaloe and passes along the eastern flanks of Moylussa, but does not ascend to its highest point. Beyond this the path climbs up into the open area of moorland. Originally this followed a bog road, but this has been improved by Coillte with a new shale track that extends all of the way to the summit, where a new marker stone has also been added. There are good views from the summit of Lough Derg, Killaloe and the surrounding countryside. It is sometimes listed as having a twin summit, but recent surveys have shown that the second peak at R6511 7557 is slightly lower. The area around the summit is known to be very boggy.

The command was based at Malta. History The British post of Commander in Chief Mediterranean Fleet was given a dual-hatted role as NATO Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Mediterranean (CINCAFMED) in charge of all forces assigned to NATO in the Mediterranean Area. The British made strong representations within NATO in discussions regarding the development of the Mediterranean NATO command structure, wishing to retain their direction of NATO naval command in the Mediterranean to protect their sea lines of communication running through the Mediterranean to the Middle East and Far East.Sean Maloney, 'To Secure Command of the Sea,' University of New Brunswick thesis, 1991, p. 258‚Äì261 Subordinate commands were under discussion in 1954 and 1956. Finally decided were: * Gibraltar Mediterranean Command (GIBMED) with headquarters at Gibraltar (Rear- Admiral R.A. Foster-Brown, Flag Officer Gibraltar) * Western Mediterranean Area (M√©diterran√©e Occidentale) (MEDOC) with headquarters at Algiers (French) under French Admiral Philip M.J. Auboyneau (COMEDOC) (who took over from Vice- Admiral A.P. Sala 1 August 1955) * Central Mediterranean Area (MEDCENT) with headquarters at Naples (Italian) first under Italian Vice-Admiral M.Girosi, and now under Vice-Admiral C. Lubranodi Negozio (COMEDCENT)(1 March 55) * Eastern Mediterranean Area (MEDEAST) (Aegan and Eastern Ionian Seas) with headquarters at Athens. (Greek Vice-Admiral P.Lappas) * Northeast Mediterranean Area (MEDNOREAST) with HQ at Ankara (Admiral S. Altincan) * Southeast Med Area with HQ at Malta (MEDSOUEAST), with personnel drawn from HQ AFMED. (Second-in-Command, Mediterranean Fleet, Vice Admiral Maxwell Richmond (18 August 1955)) It was estimated however that the expense involved in discharging the international functions of any one of these \\"headquarters mil be small and that the cost of introducing and administering international financing would be relatively high and uneconomical. Furthermore, at these command levels, national and NATO planning are closely associated and intermixed.' Therefore [t]he Standing Group, with the concurrence of the Military Representatives Committee, has therefore agreed that these Allied Area Headquarters subordinate to CINCAFMED should be supported by the nation which supports the larger national headquarters within which the international headquarters will be located. This financial arrangement should be without prejudice to decisions as to future financing if these Allied Area Headquarters are significantly expanded.\\" In 1967, the UK relinquished the NATO post of Commander in Chief Allied Forces Mediterranean, which was disbanded. Commanders Commanders included: *Admiral Sir John Edelsten (1952) *Admiral Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1952‚Äì1954) *Admiral Sir Guy Grantham (1954‚Äì1957) *Vice Admiral Sir Ralph Edwards (1957‚Äì1958) *Admiral Sir Charles Lambe (1958‚Äì1959) *Admiral Sir Alexander Bingley (1959‚Äì1961) *Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1961‚Äì1964) *Admiral Sir John Hamilton (1964‚Äì1967) References Sources *David Miller, The Cold War: A Military History (note that Miller says the three functional commands (SUBMED, SUBNOREASTMED, and USPATMED) were actually activated, while period documents make clear that at least initially they were approved in principal for wartime use, but not actually established) Category:Formations of the NATO Military Command Structure 1952‚Äì1994 Category:Military units and formations established in 1952 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1967 Category:Military of Malta ","title":"Allied Forces Mediterranean"},{"id":"43052203","text":"KDS is a SaaS technology provider for online business travel booking and expense management. Yves Weisselberger founded the company in 1994 and served as its CEO until 2011. Dean Forbes took the position of CEO after Weisselberger. The company is based in Issy-les-Moulineaux, France with additional locations in Germany, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. KDS develops Neo, a cloud-based tool which enables business users to search and book complete door-to-door itineraries, instead of the traditional way of booking individual components. Using Neo, employees also manage business expenses through a calendar-based view instead of the common spreadsheet or line-item report approach. History Yves Weisselberger founded KDSKDS for Klee Data System in 1994. In 2011, Weisselberger stepped down as CEO and chose Dean Forbes as his replacement. Weisselberger chose Forbes to take his position because of Forbes's outside perspective. KDS launched Neo, a self-booking tool in January 2013. The tool was developed on the concept of booking an entire trip from door to door with a departure location, destination, and required time of arrival. The company also partnered with various payment partners to expand payment methods for transactions completed in the booking tool and a variety of travel inventory suppliers beyond air, rail and hotel to connect such as Groundscope, Snapcar, Addison Lee and Booking.com. In September 2013, KDS signed a five-year contract with Orange, a mobile network operator and internet provider in France, allowing Orange to use Neo for its business. On January 29, 2014, the company's booking tool gained access to Renfe Operadora's content. KDS gained access after it partnered with SilverRail Technologies. The partnership also gave KDS access to North American rail content via Amtrak and Italy with Trenitalia. On July 16, 2016, KDS released its latest version of Neo which for the first time combined the functionality of its legacy corporate booking tool, the door-to-door search and calendar-view introduced in Neo under a completely redesigned consumer-grade user interface. Surveys and studies KDS released the results of a survey the company took in 2013 asking business travelers about their company's travel safety. The survey found that 15% of travelers believed that their employers were unaware of their whereabouts and that an additional 23% regularly booked outside of the company defined booking processes. Later that year, KDS and EPSA online surveyed 200 employees of companies of all sizes on expense fraud. Results found that 60% of employees thought cheating mileage expenses was justifiable because the system is poorly organized. 85% of participants stated that they had never cheated in their request for the reimbursement of business expenses. The survey also found that employee reimbursement time on average is 17 days and could take up to month. In 2016, KDS launched a survey devised to investigate the attitudes, actions and behaviors of UK and U.S. business professionals when booking and managing their work-related travel and reporting travel expenses. The survey questioned over 1,000 participants and revealed that almost one quarter (22%) embellish their business travel expenses by regularly rounding up business mileage claims by 1 and 10 miles per journey. Applications KDS developed door-to- door reservations tool Neo to manage travel booking and business travellers. Describing the concept of open booking as \\"failure dressed up as innovation,\\" Dean Forbes (previous KDS CEO) said KDS will emphasize Neo because he is confident it can sufficiently deter travelers from using alternative, unofficial booking channels. Open booking aims to collect data from bookings that take place on public websites. Neo KDS launched Neo, a door-to-door corporate booking tool, in January 2013. The tool provides consumers live street view and map overlays while displaying door-to-door itinerary time lines with steps including walking, driving, biking, rail, hotel, flights and dining. In November 2013, Neo had 11 active clients with over 300,000 profiles. In 2014, KDS developed the Neo expense solution including an optical character recognition tool, that captures data and turns it into text. The tool aims to get rid of the collection of receipts by uploading them to a user's expense system as a line item. The expense system is calendar based to provide users with context on when and how they incurred an expense. In 2015, the company rolled out the Neo Move mobile app for the iPhone and Apple Watch, branded as an ‚Äòon-trip companion and guide‚Äô by providing the traveler with real-time, location-based information and the ability to scan expense receipts on the go.

Barba was also recognized as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in Agriculture in 1974, and was given the Horticultural Technology Award in June 1999.  Early life and education  The son of lawyer Juan Madamba Barba and Lourdes Cabanos of Ilocos Norte, Barba was born the youngest of four siblings on August 31, 1939. He finished his elementary schooling at Sta. Rosa Academy in 1951, receiving the third honor among his batchmates. He went to high school at the University of the Philippines, where renowned orchid researcher Dr. Helen Layosa Valmayor became his Biology Laboratory instructor. Barba then took up a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os, majoring in Agronomy and Fruit Production, eventually graduating in 1958. Here he was inspired by his grandfather Juan Cabanas, who was then an official of the Bureau of Plants and Industry (BPI), and by his instructor Dr. L.G. Gonzales, considered the \\"father of Horticulture in the Philippines.\\"  Graduate studies  Barba received a scholarship from the University of Georgia where he began conducting experiments on inducing the flowering of plants using gibberellic acid and potassium nitrate as a fertilizer. He graduated with distinction with a Master of Science in Horticulture from the university in 1962. Barba then took up a PhD in Plant Physiology, specializing in Tropical Fruits and Tissue Culture from the East-West Center of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, graduating in 1967.  Induction of flowering of the mango by chemical spray  Objections to Barba's proposals for inducing flowering in mango were numerous at first. But with help from his friends Mr. and Mrs. Jose Quimson of Quimara Farms in San Antonio, Barba conducted his experiments. His techniques proved effective, with 400 trees aged 10‚Äì12 years old flowering within one week to one month of first being sprayed with potassium nitrate. His study, titled Induction of Flowering of the Mango by Chemical Spray was named best paper by the Crop Science Society of the Philippines (CSSP) in 1974. Barba was recognized as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in Agriculture that same year. His findings, which enabled farmers to induce flowering in mango trees regardless of season, changed the face of the mango industry in the Philippines. \\"Ramon Barba has advanced the research for many tropical crops including bananas, cassava, sugarcane on plant physiology and plant breeding.\\" In an interview released by the World Intellectual Property Organization in 2011, Barba recounts that he did not initially file a patent for his method, wanting farmers to be able to use the technique freely. Eventually, though, somebody else tried to patent the process, so Barba preemptively filed a patent application, choosing simply not to charge royalties for the use of his method. Recently The Philippine Star published \\"Too much flower inducer spraying bad for mangoes\\" http://www.philstar.com/agriculture/144612/too-much-flower-inducer-spraying- bad-mangoes  Other studies  Dr. Barba's other research breakthroughs include banana micropropagation and tissue culture of sugarcane and tissue culture of calamansi, all of which have left lasting impacts on the respective agribusiness potentials these commodities.

The single was released on 19 February 2001 on Superior Quality Recordings and reached number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's first Top 40 single. The song would be included as the closing track on the band's debut album, Vibrate You and frequently closed their live shows.  Background  = Writing and recording = Suffocate was written on a bunk bed in Sawmills Studios in Cornwall by Matt Browne and Martyn Nelson during recording sessions for their debut album Vibrate You in late 2000. Nelson revealed it was \\"a special moment\\" when Browne played the chords and Nelson came up with the song's opening riff. They quickly agreed that Suffocate would be \\"a good song\\". Suffocate was produced and mixed by John Cornfield. Like other songs recorded for Vibrate You, Suffocate contains programmed drum loops which made up a backing track for the recording and live performances. = Themes = Browne called Suffocate \\"an anti-love song, destruction of something beautiful\\". He was inspired to write the song's lyrics after returning from a tour to find his then-girlfriend had died. Browne never had the chance to say he was sorry before her passing and the song became a way of conveying his emotions. On the band's 2012 Who Do You Love?  The King Adora Story documentary he revealed that \\"things weren't well at all, most of it my fault, because I was too much caught up in the lifestyle of being on the road and ignoring what's real\\".  B-sides  Three b-sides were released on the single, Aceface, Into Space and Drink Don't Think. All three songs were recorded at Woodbine Street Recording Studios in Royal Leamington Spa and were produced by the band and Dan Sprigg, with Sprigg and Jamie Travers mixing. Into Space featured the only use of trumpets on a King Adora song. Aceface would occasionally appear in the band's live sets during 2001 and was included as a bonus track on the Enhanced CD version of Vibrate You.  Video  The Suffocate release was accompanied by King Adora's third music video, directed by Dan Crouch. Crouch commented that in the video \\"the band is taken over by an apparition that travels into the room through the chandelier\\".  Reception  In a poor review, NME said \\"it's only marginally sexier, in fact, than Darius off Popstars doing Britney\\".

Prior to World War II, Seattle's Japanese community had grown to become the second largest Nihonmachi on the West Coast of North America. History Japanese Day parade in 1909 during the Alaska-Yukon- Pacific Exposition =Early years= The period from the 1880s to the early 1900s brought a wave of Japanese immigration to the Seattle area. The initial catalyst for this immigration was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which, along with a spate of anti-Chinese violence (culminating in the Seattle riot of 1886), led to the departure of nearly all Chinese from the Seattle area. The departure of the Chinese laborers opened the door for Japanese immigrants to fill the labor void. The early Japanese immigrants consisted mostly of single males hoping to amass a fortune before returning to Japan. Many of these men were younger sons from families who, due in large part to the Japanese practice of primogeniture, were motivated to establish themselves independently abroad. These first generation Issei immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas in the southern Japanese prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka, a pattern that continued up to the Asian immigration ban in 1924. A majority of the men that came during this period found work in the surrounding canneries, railroads, and the massive logging industry around the Seattle area. These labor-intensive jobs did not provide the kind of rapid economic advancement they had planned on for their short three to five year stays. Because most of the initial Japanese immigrants during this period had only planned to stay temporarily, the early community was unstable with a ratio of 5 men to every woman and very little social, economic, or religious support. =Anti-Asian sentiment and legislation= Long before the events of World War II, Japanese immigrants to the Seattle area faced considerable racism, much tied to labor disputes that created a divide with the predominantly white population. These tensions were often inflamed by news outlets and politicians leading to petitions for Japanese exclusion and public demonstrations opposed to the import of Japanese labor. Community struggles were further exacerbated by the forced segregation and expulsions of Asian immigrants, who were unable to rent or purchase homes in West Seattle, Magnolia and other neighborhoods. The region's first anti- Japanese organization was formed in 1894, and succeeded in expelling many of the 400-500 Japanese laborers from the White River Valley area south of Seattle. The Anti-Japanese League of Washington was formed in 1916 and campaigned in support of alien land laws in Washington. By the early the 1920s, the Washington state legislature passed an alien land law that prohibited the Issei from owning land. The constitutionality of this act was challenged, but ultimately upheld by the United States Supreme Court in the 1922 decision Yamashita v. Hinkle. In 1907, the Gentlemen's Agreement between the governments of Japan and the U.S. ended the immigration of Japanese laborers, though it did allow the immigration of spouses and children of Japanese immigrants already in the United States. Prior to 1908, around seven out of eight ethnic Japanese in the continental United States were men. By 1924, due to the spousal immigration allowance, the ratio had changed to approximately four women to every six men. The Immigration Act of 1924 subsequently banned the immigration of all but a few token Japanese. =Community growth= A street in Seattle's Nihonmachi in 1909 Despite these difficulties, Japanese immigrants managed to establish a Nihonmachi, or Japantown, in the International District of SeattleBoswell, Sharon and Lorraine McConaghy. \\"Abundant dreams diverted\\" (Archive). The Seattle Times. June 23, 1996. Retrieved on December 21, 2014. and in downtown Tacoma by the 1900s. The Nihonmachi became the heart of the Japanese community with bathhouses, barbers, and entertainment including gambling and prostitution. Over time, Seattle's Japantown became informally known as the area bounded by Yesler Way on the north, 4th Avenue on the west, Dearborn Street on the south, and 14th Avenue on the east. In July 1902, the Seattle Japanese Language School was opened under the name of Nipponjinkai Juzoku Shogakko (Elementary School Attached to the Japanese Association). The establishment of this school was followed by language schools opening in Fife in 1909 and another in Tacoma by 1911. The establishment of these schools illustrated the desire of Japanese immigrants to pass on their language and culture to later generations. As the second generation, known as Nisei, began to grow, the Japanese immigrants who had once planned to return to Japan after only a few years, had begun seeing themselves as settlers. By the 1930s the ethnic Japanese population living in Seattle had reached 8,448, out of a total city population of 368,583 meaning that, \\"Japanese were Seattle‚Äôs largest non-white group, and the fourth-largest group behind several European nationalities.\\" Prior to World War II, Seattle's Nihonmachi had become the second largest on the West Coast of North America. East of Lake Washington, Japanese immigrant labor helped clear recently logged land to make it suitable to support small scale farming on leased plots. During the 20th century, the Japanese farming community became increasingly well established. Prior to World War II, some 90 percent of the agricultural workforce on the \\"Eastside\\" was of Japanese ancestry. =World War II= Within days of the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the FBI began arresting Seattle area Japanese teachers, priests, and other community leaders. Not long after, on February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued and signed Executive Order 9066, clearing the way for the mass incarceration of all persons of Japanese ancestry on the American West Coast in inland concentration camps. Seattle's Japanese community received almost no active support during this time. Among the few exceptions included University of Washington President Lee Paul Sieg, who took a leadership role in advocating for and facilitating the transfer of Nisei students to universities and colleges outside the West Coast to help them avoid being interned. In spite of his efforts, about 450 students were caught up in the oncoming internment and were forced to interrupt (often permanently) their education.Rolph, Amy. \\"Former Japanese-American students graduate UW after a 66-year wait\\" (Archive). Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Sunday May 18, 2008. Retrieved on April 9, 2015. Walt and Milly Woodward of the Bainbridge Island Review were the only West Coast editors to openly criticize Executive Order 9066. They would continue to advocate for members of the Bainbridge Island Japanese community during the war and help welcome them upon their eventual return. Tacoma mayor Harry P. Cain was one of only two elected officials on the West Coast to publicly oppose the government's internment of 110,000 Japanese Americans, in stark contrast to Washington congressional members Henry M. Jackson and Warren Magnuson. Jackson in particular, strongly advocated for the removal and exclusion of ethnic Japanese from the Pacific Coast both during and even after the war. Camp Harmony in Puyallup, 1942 By the end of March, 1942, all ethnic Japanese residents on Bainbridge Island had been removed and sent to the Manzanar camp in California. Most of the remaining 9,600 Japanese Americans in the Seattle area were forced to live behind barbed wire in converted livestock stalls and parking lots on the Puyallup Valley Fair grounds for several months while the War Relocation Authority oversaw the construction of longer term concentration camps further inland. The temporary assembly center in Puyallup was given the name Camp Harmony. Because of the internment, many members of the Japanese community permanently lost their businesses and residences.George, Kathy. \\"Seattle's Japantown remembered\\" (Archive). Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Sunday November 21, 2004.

As the war wound down, camp internees were allowed to return to the Pacific Coast, with those who chose to come back to Seattle staying in churches, other persons' residences, and the Seattle Japanese Language School building as they attempted to rebuild their lives. Seattle area residents who had been interned at Minidoka (sometimes referred to as \\"Hunt Camp\\") named their temporary home at the language school the \\"Hunt Hotel.\\" Japanese exclusion groups flared up in the Seattle area in response to the return of the internees, but after encountering some community resistance, eventually disappeared. Nevertheless, returning Japanese often encountered overt racism. On the Eastside, only eleven families chose to return. On Bainbridge Island, about half of the relocated Japanese community made the decision to come back, where they received a notably more positive reception than elsewhere on the West Coast. =Internment education and ceremonies= In 1978, the initial Day of Remembrance (observing the day that Executive Order 9066 was signed), was held at the former site of the Puyallup Assembly Center. This was the site where more than 7,000 people of Japanese descent from Western Washington and Alaska were held before being transported to more permanent concentration camps further inland. In 1981, Seattle was one of ten cities in which public hearings were held by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, in which public testimonies were heard and recorded regarding the Japanese American internment. The Nikkei Heritage Association of Washington started the \\"Omoide\\" education program to memorialize the incarceration of the Japanese people.Cohen, Aubrey. \\"Japanese center holds memories of Hunt Hotel\\" (Archive).

In 2008 UW held an honorary graduation ceremony, The Long Journey Home, for the Japanese who had seen their studies cut short, with 200 former students, most of whom were in their 80s at the time, and family members of former students present. Tetsuden Kashima, an ethnic studies professor of the university, presented the degrees. The Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial, built in memory of Japanese Americans interned from Bainbridge Island, was completed and opened to the public in 2011. Economy The Uwajimaya flagship store in Seattle Early Japanese settlers worked in coal mines, canneries of salmon products, railroad construction areas, and sawmills. By the 1920s farms owned or tended by ethnic Japanese families had produced about 75% of the produce and half of the milk generated in the Seattle area. This included farms in Bellevue and the White River valley. Seattle's Pike Place Market was the point of sale of much of the produce. By the start of World War I, Japanese truck farmers occupied about 70% of the market stalls. Founded in 1928 in Tacoma, the Asian supermarket chain Uwajimaya closed during the Japanese American internment. It reopened in Seattle's International District following the end of World War II. Uwajimaya opened its first branch in Bellevue, Washington in 1978 and opened another branch in Renton, Washington in 2009. Nintendo of America has been headquartered in Redmond, Washington since 1982. Print media Seattle's first Japanese newspaper, the Report, was issued in 1899 and remained in circulation until about 1904. Founded in 1902 by first generation immigrants Kiyoshi Kumamoto and investors, the North American Post became one of the region's main Japanese newspapers. Originally called Hokubei Jiji (The North American Times), it was the country's third Japanese- American newspaper. Other daily Japanese papers in Seattle before World War II included Asahi Shinbun and The Great Northern Daily News. In 1928, James Sakamoto and his wife Misao founded the Japanese American Courier, the first Japanese American newspaper published entirely in English. Aimed specifically at the American-born Nisei, the Courier reported on Japanese affairs while encouraging its readers to assimilate into \\"Americanized\\" society.Ichioka, Yuji. \\"A Study in Dualism: James Yoshinori Sakamoto and the Japanese American Courier, 1928-1942.\\" In Before Internment: Essays in Prewar Japanese American History, eds.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, all Japanese newspapers ceased publication. Once the war ended, as people were released from the camps, some Japanese-language media started to reappear. In June 1946, the North American Post was revived, and its editor in chief was the same person (Sumio Arima) who published Hokubei Jiji before the war.

A specialist sprinter, he showed promise as a two-year-old in 1977, and improved to become a high-class performer in 1978. He won only one race as a three-year-old but was placed in several major sprints. In 1979 he improved again to become the highest-rated sprinter in the United Kingdom, winning the Temple Stakes, King's Stand Stakes and Haydock Sprint Cup in England and the Prix de l'Abbaye in France. He was the first horse to win both the King's Stand Stakes and the Prix de l'Abbaye. He was retired to stud where he was an immediate success but died in 1983. Background Double Form was a \\"big, strong, good-looking\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by his owner Baroness Thyssen. He was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Marwell, Rose Bowl, Flying Water, Homing and Sigy and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Double Form's dam, Fanghorn was placed in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and was also the dam of Gradiva, the ancestor of the Irish Derby winner Soldier of Fortune. Baroness Thyssen sent the colt into training with Fulke Johnson Houghton at Blewbury in Wiltshire. Double Form usually raced in blinkers Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= Double Form began his racing career in the Granville Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse in July. Ridden by Lester Piggott he was given an easy introduction and finished sixth of the fourteen runners behind Nutibara. The colt then suffered from a skin problem and did not appear again until October, when he ran in the Burr Stakes over seven and a half furlongs at Lingfield Park Racecourse in October. Starting favourite, he won comfortably from Whitstead, from whom he was receiving eight pounds. =1978: three-year- old season= In the spring of 1978, Double Form was considered a classic contender, but after finishing third in the Greenham Stakes he was unplaced when tried over one mile in the 2000 Guineas. After the Guineas, Double Form was brought back to shorter distances. He won only one of his remaining eight races but established himself as a high-class sprinter. Double Form's sole victory came in May when he won the Great Eastern Handicap at Newmarket Racecourse, carrying a big weight to victory over six furlongs. He finished second to Persian Bold, when ridden by Lester Piggott in the Heron Stakes over seven furlongs on 3 June and then ran second in the Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot, beaten half a length by the Irish filly Sweet Mint. In July he was moved up to Group One class and finished third behind Solinus and Sanedtki in the July Cup having looked a likely winner approaching the final furlong. In the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood Racecourse, Double Form was allotted a weight of 131 pounds an unusually high weight for a three-year-old and finished second to the 50/1 outsider Ahonoora, to whom he was conceding 19 pounds. In October he was sent to France for the Group One Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by John Reid he started the 29/1 outsider of the seven runner field but produced his best performance of the year to finish third, beaten three lengths and half a length by Sigy and Solinus. On his final appearance of the season he ran poorly when finishing unplaced behind Absalom in the Vernons Sprint Cup. =1979: four-year-old season= Double Form began his third season with an easy win over six furlongs at Thirsk Racecourse and then finished second to Vaigly Great in the five furlong Palace House Stakes at Newmarket, beaten one and a half lengths. At Sandown in May, the colt recorded his first Group race success in the Temple Stakes, beating Ahonoora by a length, with the filly Greenland Park a length and a half away in third place. In June at Royal Ascot, Double Form was moved back up to Group One level for the King's Stand Stakes, in which he started at odds of 12/1 and ridden by John Reid. The field included Vaigly Great, Ahonoora, Golden Thatch (Ballyogan Stakes, Greenlands Stakes), Devon Ditty (Cheveley Park Stakes, Flying Childers Stakes) and King of Macedon (Prix Maurice de Gheest). The race was dominated from the start by Golden Thatch, Double Form and Ahonoora. When Golden Thatch weakened a furlong from the finish, Double Form went to the front and held off the persistent challenge of Ahonoora to win by three-quarters of a length. Double Form was aimed at the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket, but was withdrawn after contracting a viral infection, and did not appear again until the William Hill Sprint Championship at York Racecourse in August. He appeared to be less than fully fit and finished fourth behind Thatching, Ahonoora and Abdu, but was promoted to third after the winner was disqualified for causing interference in the closing stages. In September, Double Form started at odds of 11/4 for the Vernons Sprint Cup and won by three lengths from Ahonoora. He was ridden in this race by the veteran Geoff Lewis, who had been persuaded by Fulke Johnson Houghton to postpone his retirement to take the ride. After the race Lewis said; \\"It was well worth it, it's wonderful to go out on a winner in a big race like this\\". Double Form's final race was the Prix de l'Abbaye on 7 October. Although the King's Stand Stakes and the Abbaye were the only two Group One races in Europe open to three-year-olds and older horses, no sprinter had previously completed the double. Double Form started 3.9/1 second favourite behind Thatching, with the other contenders including King of Macedon, Sigy, Ahonoora, Adraan (Prix d'Arenberg, Prix du Bois), Greenland Park and Kilijaro. Making the most of a favourable inside draw, Reid sent Double Form into an early lead and looked likely to win easily 400 metres from the finish. In the closing stage however, he began to tire but ran on \\"most bravely\\", and in a very close finish he prevailed by a head and a nose from Kilijaro and Greenland Park, with the Irish filly Baby Brew half a length away in fourth. Assessment In 1977, the independent Timeform organisation awarded Double Form a rating of 110 p, the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make significantly more than normal improvement: in their annual Racehorses of 1977, they described him as \\"a colt of tremendous potential\\". In the following year he was rated 123 by Timeform, seven pounds below their best sprinter Solinus. In the official International Classification, he was rated six pounds below Solinus and thirteen pounds behind the top-rated three-year- old Ile de Bourbon. In 1979 Timeform praised Double Form for his \\"grit and determination\\" and awarded him a rating of 130, making him their highest-rated British-trained sprinter, one pound behind the Irish-trained Thatching. The International Classification rated him five pounds inferior to Thatching and eight pounds behind Ile de Bourbon, making him the ninth-best older horse in Europe. In the Gilbey Champion Racehorses awards, based on points awarded for performances in major races, Double Form was named Champion Sprinter of 1979. Stud record Double Form was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Airlie Stud, near Dublin at a fee of ¬£4,000 in 1980. He had little opportunity to establish, himself, dying in 1983 at the age of eight, after severing a main artery when covering a mare. He showed considerable promise in his brief stud career, siring Huntingdale, Timeform's top-rated two-year-old of 1985 and Double Schwartz a sprinter who emulated his sire by winning the Prix de l'Abbaye in 1986.

World War II In December 1944, Ren√©e Lemaire returned to Bastogne to visit her parents, and was trapped when the Germans launched its Ardennes offensive on December 16, 1944. Along with nurse Augusta Chiwy, she volunteered at an aid station for the American 20th Armored Infantry Battalion on December 21, 1944. In a commendation request from Battalion Surgeon Dr. Jack T. Prior, Lemaire was described as \\"cheerfully accepted the Herculean task and worked without adequate rest or food...\\", that she \\"changed dressings, fed patients unable to feed themselves, gave out medications, bathed and made the patients more comfortable...\\", and \\"her very presence among those wounded men seem to be an inspiration to those whose morale had declined from prolonged suffering.\\" On December 24, 1944, around 8:30PM, Germans bombed the building where the aid station was located. According to a column in a Belgian newspaper, the aid station in the basement of the Sarma Store on rue de Neufchateau was demolished.

Originally completed in 1912 and raised several times afterward, the dam is one of the oldest components of the city of San Diego's municipal water system, providing between of water per year. It is one of the few facilities in the San Diego water supply system that relies entirely on local runoff. Dimensions Morena Dam is located in the Cleveland National Forest at the headwaters of Cottonwood Creek, about east of downtown San Diego. The dam is high from the riverbed and long, with a height of from the foundations. Altogether the dam contains of earth and rock fill. At its full height, the reservoir can hold of water, covering . The drainage area above the dam is and includes the tributary Morena Creek, for which the dam and reservoir are named. Water is released via a long tunnel, fed by an intake tower that can draw up to water from different elevations of the reservoir. The spillway is located on the north side of the dam and has a crest long, topping out at above sea level. Flood flows through the spillway are controlled by steel flash gates high. The spillway has a capacity of approximately . Usage The Morena reservoir serves primarily for long-term storage of winter flood flows in Cottonwood Creek, and is the uppermost of a chain of three reservoirs ‚Äì Lower Otay, Barrett and Morena ‚Äì that provide water to the city of San Diego. Water released from Morena Dam travels several miles down Cottonwood Creek to Barrett Lake, where it is diverted to Lower Otay via the long Dulzura Conduit. From Lower Otay Reservoir the water enters the Otay Water Treatment Plant, before flowing into the municipal water network. The entire project is known as the Cottonwood-Otay Water System. Originally providing the city's main water supply, it was relegated to a secondary role after the city began importing water from the Colorado River in 1939. The reservoir now provides a backup water supply that is drawn down during dry years, when stored local water provides a much cheaper alternative than imported water ‚Äì costing $240 per acre-foot whereas Colorado River water typically costs about $800 per acre-foot. On average, Morena provides only about 3 percent of the city's total supply. As Morena Reservoir has a larger surface area and thus greater evaporative losses than Barrett Lake, the city generally prioritizes storage in Barrett. Water is moved downstream from Morena as often as possible, if storage space is available in the lower reservoir. In addition, the watershed above Morena generally does not produce enough runoff to fill the reservoir, except in very wet years. Inflows average per year, or barely a fifth of the storage capacity. As a result, Morena only reaches spillway level about once per decade. History The dam was first proposed in the 1880s by the Southern California Mountain Water Company, which envisioned a system of reservoirs and connecting pipelines to transport water from the Tijuana and Otay river basins to San Diego. A bond issue was approved in 1896 for construction of the Morena Dam, which would form the highest and most remote of the reservoirs. Construction began in fall 1896, directed by San Diego city engineer Edwin Capps. The initial construction was fraught with problems caused by leakage and poor engineering, and work stopped in April 1898. It was not until May 1909 when construction resumed, under engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy. The job was finally finished in 1912, at a cost of about $1.5 million. The city of San Diego purchased the dam from Mountain Water Company in 1914. Since then it has been raised several times to increase its capacity ‚Äì in 1917, in 1923, in 1930 and in 1946. The spillway was rebuilt and widened in 1946 to increase its safety margin in floods. Because the dam was built in a high mountain area with some of the highest annual rainfall in San Diego County, it was anticipated that its reservoir would fill every year. However, the early 1900s saw continuous drought conditions in Southern California, and the reservoir did not fill to more than a third of its capacity in the first few years of operations. It was not until 1916 (see below) when Morena reached capacity for the first time. =The \\"Rainmaker\\"= In 1916 the city of San Diego hired Charles Hatfield, a man known as the \\"Rainmaker\\", who had offered to fill Morena Reservoir at a cost of $10,000. Although the city council doubted his ability, Hatfield was hired and set to work \\"rainmaking\\" on January 1. By January 10, flooding rains began to fall throughout San Diego County. Rising at a peak rate of two feet (0.6 m) per hour, Morena Reservoir filled and spilled on January 26, a mere from the top of the dam. In the rest of the county, flooding washed out bridges, inundated neighborhoods and killed over 50 people. The city subsequently deemed the rains an \\"act of God\\" and determined that if Hatfield were to collect the fee for filling Morena reservoir he would also have to pay for the damages caused by the rains. Hatfield never took the money.

Boutique Blends Cigars, formerly the Habana Cuba Cigar Company, is an American manufacturer of premium hand-rolled cigars based in Miami, Florida. The company was established in 1996 during the American cigar boom as the non-Cuban manufacturer of the historic Cuban \\"Oliveros\\" brand. The company was sold in 2002 to a new ownership group consisting of the Cuban-born Rafael Nodal (born 1964); his wife Alina Cordoves Nodal, and Hank Bischoff. In addition to products made under the Oliveros label, Boutique Blends is the maker of the brand names King Havano, Swag, and Aging Room. The name Boutique Blends was adopted as a new name for the company in February 2012 as part of a general repositioning of the firm away from flavored cigars and towards a premium, small batch, unflavored product. In 2013 Boutique Brands' Aging Room Quattro F55 Concerto cigar was named the No. 2 cigar of the year by the influential glossy magazine Cigar Aficionado. Company history =Establishment= The Habana Cuba Cigar Company was established in 1996 in Miami Lakes, Florida, as the non- Cuban licensee of the historic Cuban brand Oliveros.Bob Ashley, \\"Habana Cuba Cigar Company: Anchored with the U.S. rights to a native Cuban cigar brand, Habana Cuba Cigar Co. is forging a niche in premium flavored cigars and expanding its portfolio of traditional cigars,\\" Smokeshop Magazine, April 2003. The American cigar market was entering the 5th year of a massive cigar boom, marked by demand outstripping supply at the wholesale and retail levels and the launch of many new brands to capitalize on a very favorable manufacturing climate. Habana Cuba Cigar Company launched the Oliveros brand for the American market as a flavored cigar, contracting production from Milton Germosen in the Dominican Republic. The timing of the company's launch was not propitious, however, as in 1997 the supply of premium cigars began to surpass demand as the cigar fad faded. Millions of unsold cigars began to accumulate in inventory and the cigar boom gave way to a protracted retrenchment of the market, or \\"bust.\\"Simon Chase, \\"Havana's Obesity Challenge,\\" Cigar Magazine, vol. 7, no. 3 (Fall 2010), pp. 125-129. Hubana Cuba Cigar and Oliveros soldiered on in the difficult market, turning to sellers on the internet for its primary distribution.Gregory Mottola, \\"Sitting Down with Rafael Nodal, Owner, Boutique Blends Cigars,\\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 22, no. 5 (July/August 2013), pp. 153-158. The main distributor of the company's product was a website operated by Rafael Nodal and Hank Bischoff which specialized in the sale of the creations of small brands based in the Miami area. As its most important sellers Nodal and Bischoff were not long in becoming formal advisors to Habana Cuba Cigar Company. In 2002 the owners of the company decided to sell the Habana Cuba Cigar Company. Rafael Nodal and Hank Bischoff, together with Nodal's wife, Alina Cordoves Nodal, herself the Cuban-born daughter of a second-generation tobacco distributor, entered into partnership and purchased the firm. =New ownership and a new emphasis= At the time of the 2002 acquisition, the portfolio of Habana Cuba Cigar Co. consisted of flavored cigars, with a handful of unflavored products such as the Oliveros Classic and the Oliveros Gran Reserva. The company's new owners soon discontinued their retail website in order to better concentrate their efforts on building wholesale distribution of the Oliveros brand. Over time it became clear that the brand's foray into manufacture of flavored cigars ‚Äî a market dominated by inexpensive machine-made products produced by large tobacco corporations ‚Äî was an unprofitable way forward and that a more likely path to profitability and growth lay in the production of premium handrolled cigars. The Habana Premier Selection, a new premium product called constructed from high-quality Nicaraguan tobaccoand manufactured under contract by Perdomo, was introduced. This marked the first time that a brand not called \\"Oliveros\\" was produced by the company. In 2005 another new brand typified by a thick ring gauge was launched, called XL for Men. Instead of marketing the fat cigars to a specialized subset of experienced smokers, the brand was launched as an item for a mass market. An inability to maintain consistent quality and taste was an ongoing issue for the company and the size of the product relative to the rest of the market in that year further marginalized the brand's appeal. Rafael Nodal recalled the failed XL for Men effort in a 2014 interview: > \\"XL for Men was not a successful line.... [W]e did everything wrong.... We > should have marketed it as a niche product. At the time, cigars rarely went > to 60 ring [0.9375 inches in diameter]. Now, it's normal. We may have been > ahead of our time with the ring gauges, but we didn't have the necessary > knowledge to execute it properly.\\"Quoted in Mottola, \\"Sitting Down with > Rafael Nodal, Owner, Boutique Blends Cigars,\\" pg. 155. A more successful new product followed, a line called Oliveros King Havano. The cigar, developed with the aid of esteemed Nicaraguan tobacco grower Nestor Plasencia, was a Nicaraguan puro and gained a following which enabled the production of 300,000 units ‚Äî the most successful release for Oliveros to date. The line was released both through physical \\"brick-and-mortar\\" tobacco shops and through the mass marketing of the catalog trade, a decision later regarded by company founder Rafael Nodal as a mistake, since it ultimately undermined the perceived value of the line. Habana Cuba Cigar Co. next moved further into the production of specialized, small batch production with the launch of its next product line, a brand called Swag. In contrast to the Nicaraguan-made King Havano, the company returned to the Dominican Republic for production of the new line, contracting manufacture to Jos√© \\"Jochi\\" Blanco and his Tabacalera La Palma. The spicy line made use of Cuban seed and was a puro ‚Äî containing 100% Dominican leaf. The new line was well received by consumers and reinforced the company's decision to move from mass market to boutique premium production. The company moved even deeper into small batch production in 2011 with the launch of its Aging Room brand, a line which made use of premium aged Dominican tobacco and which was produced in even more limited quantities than its Swag products. =Launch of Boutique Brands= In 2012 the company's repositioning as a maker of small batch, premium cigars was further solidified with adoption of a new name, Boutique Blends Cigars. The announcement of the new company name was made on February 21 at the Pro Cigar trade show and festival in Santiago, Dominican Republic.\\"Oliveros Cigars Launches Boutique Blends Cigars,\\" company press release. Boutique Blends received a major boost in the cigar world that same year, when the company's Aging Room Small Batch M356, a spicy ligero-laced cigar, made the list of the Top 25 Cigars of 2011 in Cigar Aficionado magazine. This was followed two years later with an even greater triumph, when the Aging Room Small Batch F55 was named the No. 2 Cigar of the Year for 2013 by that same magazine. Strategic Alliance with Altadis On May 15th, 2017 Boutique Blends announced it was entering into a strategic alliance with Altadis USA by which Altadis would now handle sales and distribution for Boutique Blends portfolio. As a part of that alliance, Rafael Nodal would also join the Altadis USA executive team handling quality and production innovation across the whole Altadis portfolio.

Etymology  The refuge took its names from le col des Sarradets () located just a few meters north-west and from le col de la Br√®che de Roland located above it.  History  The cirque de Gavarnie is one of the biggest sites in the Pyrenees and one of the most frequented.

The need of a larger and more comfortable refuge was felt for a long while, when Robert Ollivier launched the project in 1942. The construction started in 1951, on the draughts of architect from Tarbes J. Martin. It was of a new kind at the time, in what can be considered as the third period of pyrenean refuges (housing style with shallow roofs and widely opened windows), in local ashlar and a copper-leaf-covered roof. It offered 60 places arranged in two dormitories of bunk-beds couchettes and a guide bedroom. Built by Castells enterprise of Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre, it was inaugurated in 1956 by Maurice Herzog, president of the Club alpin fran√ßais. It was the first modern post-war refuge in the Pyrenees.

The DPR first flag variant is seen displayed amongst other flags such as the Russian and Donetsk Oblast ones. The flag of the Donetsk People's Republic claims to be based on the flag of Donetsk‚ÄìKrivoy Rog Soviet Republic. The black is commonly thought to represent the Black Sea or the coal industry in the Donbass region. The blue is thought to represent water and red is freedom. However, there is no proof that such flag was used by the DKSR, which used the red flag as symbol. The original DPR flag also featured a coat of arms of the republic that said \\"Donetsk Rus'\\" (–î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫–∞—è –†—É—Å—å) in the centre. It was identical to the eastern Ukrainian Donetsk Republic political party, while also retaining the words \\"Donetsk Republic\\" (–î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫–∞—è –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞) in Russian. A more simplified white double-headed eagle variant was used more commonly by initial pro-Russian protesters since 7 April 2014 and then by separatists of the Donbass People's Militia.

Chinese workers arriving in the 1860s were welcomed, because the Seattle area was sparsely settled and workers were needed; within a few decades, however, newly arrived white settlers resented the Chinese workers, and there were several anti-Chinese riots as the whites attempted to expel the Chinese from the area. Chinese settlement persisted, with the immigrants settling in a well-defined Chinatown where they maintained their culture through family groups, associations, and churches. In the mid-20th century Chinese Americans joined with other immigrant groups to oppose racial discrimination. In 1962 a Chinese American became the first person of Asian ancestry to hold elective office in the state of Washington. History Chinese people were the first Asians to settle in Seattle, arriving directly from China or via San Francisco in the 1860s. The majority of these immigrants came from the area around Guangzhou (Canton). They worked as fishermen, cannery and mill workers, miners, loggers, or domestic help. Later they worked on railroad construction and building projects. Initially welcomed because of the region's labor shortage, the Chinese later became resented as more white settlers arrived. This resentment was felt in other states as well, notably California, and in 1882 it led to the passage of the federal Chinese Exclusion Act. Racial tension in the Washington Territory came to a head in the 1880s during an economic recession. White workers, particularly mine workers, believed the Chinese workers were taking their jobs, and resorted to rioting and force to make the Chinese leave. The Seattle riot of 1886 led to the forced expulsion of some 350 Chinese men; many others left voluntarily. Other anti-Chinese riots in the area included the Tacoma riot of 1885 and the Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885 in what is now Issaquah. President Grover Cleveland ordered federal military forces into Seattle and other parts of the Washington Territory to restore order. In 1886, Washington Territory added a constitutional provision barring aliens ineligible for citizenship from owning property, which effectively prohibited Chinese immigrants from land ownership.Grant, Nicole. \\"White Supremacy and the Alien Land Laws of Washington State.\\" University of Washington (2008). Retrieved 15 July 2014. Historic Chinatown Gate\\" in Chinatown, completed in 2008thumbleft At first the Chinese workers settled along the eastern edge of Pioneer Square, in the area now occupied by the 2nd Avenue Extension. A new Chinatown grew up in the early 1900s on fill land south of Pioneer Square. Its Wa Chong Co. was the first Asian-owned manufacturing business in America. Japanese and Filipino residents also settled there. By the 1930s Chinatown and \\"Japan Town\\" were distinct neighborhoods. The Internment of Japanese Americans during World War II led to the abandonment of Japan Town and its takeover by other ethnic groups from Asia and the Pacific Islands. In 1951 the area was renamed the Seattle Chinatown-International District to reflect its growing diversity. In the 1930s, the Chinese American community united with the Japanese American and Filipino American communities to fight a proposed ban on interracial marriage. Later the same communities rallied against other discriminatory practices such as restrictive housing and racial preference in hiring. In the late 1960s, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement and student opposition to the Vietnam War, these traditional coalitions were formalized as the Asian Coalition for Equality, the Oriental Student Movement, and the Asian American Student Coalition. In 1962 Wing Luke became the first Asian American to hold elected office (Seattle City Council) in Washington state. The Wah Mee massacre occurred in 1983. In 1997 Gary Locke was elected governor of the state of Washington, becoming the first, and the only, Chinese American to serve as governor of a state; in 2009 he became the first Chinese American ambassador to China. Demographics As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 45,018 Chinese Americans living in King County, including 3,088 who identified themselves as Taiwanese. Members of the Chinese American community run the gamut from those whose families have lived in the United States for generations to recent immigrants. Culture Chinese settlers in the Seattle area maintained their identity through tongs and family associations such as Gee How Oak Tin. The Chong Wa Benevolent Association, a coalition of Chinese American groups and businesses, was chartered in 1910. Churches such as the Chinese Baptist Church also served to unite the community. The Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience (nicknamed \\"The Wing\\") is located in the Chinatown-International District and is housed in the East Kong Yick Building, a restored 1910 building.

Binion was born in Macon, Mississippi. He holds a BFA from Wayne State University (1971) in Detroit, Michigan and an MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He was a Professor of Art at Columbia College in Chicago from 1993-2015. Early life McArthur Binion was born in 1946 on a cotton farm in Macon, Mississippi to Russell Earl Binion and Martha Binion in a family of 11 children. In 1951, his family moved to Detroit. Career Binion received his BFA from Wayne State University, Detroit, in 1971, and his MFA from the Cranbook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, MI, in 1973. In 1973, he moved to New York, where Binion worked amidst and befriended many other artists of the era working in the city, such as Jean Michel- Basquiat and Sol Lewitt. The same year he moved to New York, Binion was selected for a group show at Artists Space, the non-profit organization's second exhibition co-curated by Mr. Lewitt and Carl Andre. Binion's paintings have since appeared in the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the Studio Museum in New York, and the Detroit Institute of Art. In 1991, Binion moved to Chicago, where he took a position as Professor of Art at Columbia College in 1993. Though he worked continuously during that period, he exhibited his work infrequently until Chicago dealer Kavi Gupta began representing him in 2013. Binion was represented by Kavi Gupta and Galerie Lelong & Co. until he joined Lehmann Maupin and Massimo De Carlo galleries in 2018. In 2017, Binion was included the Christine Macel's curated VIVA ARTE VIVA for the 57th Venice Biennale, where his paintings from his DNA series received notable mention. A 2019 front page article in The New York Times recognized him, and others, as among a \\"generation of African-American artists in their 70s and 80s who are enjoying a market renaissance after decades of indifference.\\" Work McArthur Binion's work primarily consists of minimalist abstract paintings, created using crayons, oil stick, and ink, often on rigid surfaces such as wood or aluminum. For many years, Binion has been incorporating laser-prints as a collaged ground on top of which he applies other mediums. Binion says that what he takes away from minimalism in his creative process is ‚Äúthat you want to do your own stuff in your own image.‚Äù His work has been compared to Dorothea Rockburne, Robert Mangold, Robert Ryman and Jasper Johns‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dutch Wives‚Äù paintings at times. Binion identifies as a \\"Rural Modernist,\\" and says that his work \\"begins at the crossroads‚Äîat the intersection of Bebop improvisation and Abstract Expressionism.‚Äù His work is influenced by modernist artists such as Kasimir Severinovich Malevich, Piet Mondrian, and Wifredo Lam. He is considered \\"expressionistic, grided abstract paintings have garnered significant (albeit long-overdue) attention.\\" In his most recent exhibition (the DNA Study series), Binion's paintings aren‚Äôt fully abstract, but attempt to talk about the black experience and his personal history at the same time. Acting as a kind of template for gridded marks in black, white and occasionally brightly colored oil-paint-stick layered on top, are pages from Binion's 1970's handwritten phone books, passport ID and negatives of his birth certificate.Recovering Abstraction: McArthur Binion‚Äôs Intimate Grids Retrieved 2017-03-04 To fully experience this artist's work, the viewer/participant must get close to the piece of art. Underneath the horizontal and vertical lines of various hues a story is being told. Binion painstakingly combines his personal story with abstract shapes and patterns which are interesting to view as they draw you into the story of the artist. Ghost: Rhythms, a 2013 of early work at Kavi Gupta Gallery, shows the influence of action painting, Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Binion pulls stylistic tropes common to folk artists as well, borrowing quilting patterns, layering photographic imagery and motifs and grids. He does all this while using one implement: his characteristic \\"crayon,\\" or paint stick, which allowed him to move past oil paint. \\"In 1972 when I started to use them, they were basically industrial marking sticks,\\" he recalls. Binion effectively converts an elementary tool into a refined hand-held instrument. He thrives in the effort of that conversion, having developed an ornate and labored approach that demands strenuous hours, and‚Äîas Binion has noted‚Äîresonates with the cotton-picking of his childhood. He had to train himself to be ambidextrous to negotiate hand fatigue, and works an entire surface of a painting in one sitting, before returning to rework that surface the next day or week or month. Some works take years to complete. Depending on how long he lets the paint dry, it becomes more or less malleable, responding to his hand like pigmented, sculptural putty. What results is a mash-up of pointillism. ‚ÄúThe part I took from Minimalism is that you want to do your own stuff in your own image,‚Äù Binion says in the release for this show, and this is what he always did, as one can see in the exhaustive yet delicate marks of Icecicle: Juice from 1976, which emanate an uncanny shimmer. Small works like MAB: 1971: VIII, 2015, almost naively ram a puzzle of Binion's portrait ID photos (the kind we all know and don't necessarily love) directly up against the artist's overlaid lines of oil bar, but the outcome is phenomenal. Binion's work isn't specifically race-related, but the pictures of the artist in his youth (with rounded afro) take stock of unaccounted for signifiers that collapse into his own particular story. Larger works like DNA: Black Painting: Ph Bk / B Cert: II, 2015 also sideswipe racial connotation with color as racial terminology, while also ratcheting up the artist's litany of Op art effects, ranging from Ryman's sly use of chromatic underpainting to Jasper Johns‚Äô shifting avalanche of cross-hatch marks. Like many successful artists that fit the modernist profile, Binion makes work that is a study in oppositions: line and shape, figure and ground, image and abstraction, copy and original, color and black & white. His modus operandi is to somehow magically blend an assault of binaries into a single, unified emblem of the unique and complicated self.

Construction and commissioning  An aerial view of NOAAS Oscar Dyson (R 224) underway. Oscar Dyson was built by VT Halter Marine at Moss Point, Mississippi, and was launched on 17 October 2003, sponsored by Peggy Dyson-Malson, a ship-to-shore weather broadcaster for the National Weather Service in Kodiak, Alaska, from 1974 and 1999 and the widow of the ship's namesake, Alaskan fisherman and fishing industry leader Oscar E. Dyson. Delivered to NOAA on 1 August 2004, the ship eventually proceeded to Kodiak, Dysons home town, where she was commissioned into service as NOAAS Oscar Dyson (R 224) on 28 May 2005.noaa.gov NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson  Characteristics and capabilities  ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle is launched from NOAAS Oscar Dyson (R 224) in Puget Sound. Capable of conducting multidisciplinary oceanographic operations in support of biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Oscar Dyson was commissioned as the first of a class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull- generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to collect data on ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20 km/hr). NOAAS OSCAR DYSON docked in her home port of Kodiak, Alaska Oscar Dyson has a traction-type oceanographic winch which can deploy up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) of 17-mm (0.67-inch) wire rope or other cable, including fiberoptic cable. She also has two hydrographic winches, each of which can deploy 3,600 meters (11,811 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) EM cable, two trawl winches, each of which can deploy 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of cable, and a Gilson winch. She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) at her bow. She has an A-frame on her starboard side with a safe working load of 8,050 pounds (3,651 kg) and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. Oscar Dyson has various laboratory capabilities. A wet laboratory, a dry laboratory, a biology laboratory, and a hydrographic laboratory all are situated on the starboard side of her main deck, while an electronics and computer laboratory are on the port side of her main deck. Her wet laboratory includes a climate-controlled space with a built-in chiler system. Oscar Dyson carries two boats. Her 27-foot (8.2-meter) survey launch has a 260-horsepower (194-kW) motor and can accommodate up to eight people. Her 22-foot (6.7-meter) rescue boat has a 256-horsepower (191-kW) motor and can carry up to six people. Designed for operations in Alaskan waters, Oscar Dyson has an ice- strengthened welded-steel hull. In addition to her crew of 24, she can accommodate up to 15 scientists.  Service history  Operated by NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and with Kodiak as her home port, Oscar Dysons primary purpose is to support NOAA's mission of protecting, restoring, and managing the use of living marine, coastal, and ocean resources. She conducts projects for NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center and the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, studying and monitoring Alaskan pollock and other fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. She makes weather and sea state observations, conducts oceanographic research and habitat assessments, and surveys marine mammal and seabird populations. In 2007 and 2008, Oscar Dyson took scientists to the Bering Sea so that they could capture seals on the ice there and attach satellite tags to them with which to collect movement and behavior data. To expand NOAA's ability to monitor ribbon, bearded, spotted, and ringed seals, whose broad range and remoteness from shore make surveying them using manned helicopters challenging, NOAA conducted tests of the ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aboard Oscar Dyson in October 2008. On 15 and 16 October 2008, scientists and technicians aboard Oscar Dyson conducted three successful test flights of the ScanEagle over Puget Sound, Washington, launching it from a pneumatic catapult attached to the top of her bridge, flying it by remote control from Oscar Dyson, and recovering it with a \\"skyhook\\" system - a vertical line deployed over Oscar Dysons starboard side between a winch and a boom - that the Scaneagle could grab with hooks on its wingtips as it returned to the ship. As a United States Coast Guard officer aboard Oscar Dyson to study the feasibility of using the ScanEagle for search and rescue missions looked on, Oscar Dysons bridge personnel and the embarked UAV pilots cooperated closely to ensure that the ships speed and heading facilitated the launch and recovery of the aircraft. The test demonstrated the feasibility of using UAVs to assess the abundance and distribution of seals, which began in the spring of 2009.McLean, Sheila, \\"Unmanned Aircraft Launched from NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson,\\" NOAA Fisheries News Release, October 29, 2008. noaa.gov National Marine Mammal Laboratory Dyson UAS Test Flights See also * NOAA ships and aircraft  References  External links * noaa.gov NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson: Oscar Dyson * noaa.gov NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson: Peggy Dyson-Malson Category:Ships of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Category:Ships built in Moss Point, Mississippi Category:2003 ships ","title":"NOAAS Oscar Dyson (R 224)"},{"id":"43052942","text":"La Paix du m√©nage (Domestic Bliss) is a French short story by Honor√© de Balzac, which was first published by Mame et Delaunay-Vall√©e in 1830 as one of the author's Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e (Scenes from Private Life). It was republished in 1842 as part of Furne's edition of Balzac's La Com√©die humaine. Dedicated to the author's dear niece, Valentine Surville, this vivid and incisive novella is constructed like a classical French play, observing the three unities of time (an hour), place (a ball) and subject (the seduction of a young woman). Contrary to what the title might lead one to expect, the work is not concerned with the married life of the French bourgeoisie; it is, rather, a scintillating depiction of high society under the First Empire.  Plot The Comte de Gondreville hosts an ostentatious ball in his stately mansion. Among the guests is an unknown woman in a blue dress. She is discreet and bashful, and clearly at odds with the arrogance and excitability of the other guests; it is as though she does not belong in these opulent surroundings. Intrigued by this pretty young woman, the Comte de Montcornet and Baron de la Roche-Hugon make a wager to see which of them can seduce this heavenly figure, who is, in fact, the wife of the Comte de Soulanges. A tangled web of amorous intrigues ensues.  Theme  The dense structure of this novella resembles the stagecraft of a play. The masked ball also conjures up the theatre, where no one is quite what he or she seems.

Often beginning with manipulation during the interview process, to engaging in counterproductive work behavior (especially when their self-esteem is threatened). Narcissism is both a personality trait and a personality disorder, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. Owing to these differences from typical workplace behaviors, Psychologists have studied the interview strategies of narcissists, their impact on coworkers, correlated behaviors, motivations, and preferences. Following these investigations, many have offered insight into the best practices when working with a narcissist, and perhaps some amount of benefit stemming from some of their behaviors. Oliver James identifies narcissism as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, with the others being psychopathy and Machiavellianism.James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013) These three traits have been found to correlate moderately to strongly with one another.Furnham et al. (2017)The Dark Triad of Personality: A 10 Year Review Dark triad traits also share strong negative correlations with Honesty-Humility traits. Narcissism is distinguished from the other dark triad traits by its positive correlations with openness and extroversion. Job interviews Narcissists typically perform well at job interviews; they receive more favorable hiring ratings from interviewers than individuals who are not narcissists.Grijalva, E., & Harms, P. D. (2014). Narcissism: An integrative synthesis and dominance complementarity model. The Academy of Management Perspectives, 28(2), 108-127. Even more experienced and trained raters evaluate narcissists more favorably.Brunell et al., 2008 A.B. Brunell, W.A. Gentry, W.K. Campbell, B.J. Hoffman, K.W. Kuhnert, K.G. Demarree. Leader emergence: The case of the narcissistic leader. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34 (2008), pp. 1663‚Äì1676. Schnure, K. (2010). Narcissism 101. Industrial Engineer, 42(8), 34-39. This is perhaps because interviews are one of the few social situations where narcissistic behaviors, such as boasting, actually create a positive impression; however, favorable impressions of narcissists are often short- lived.Paulhus, D. L. (1998). Interpersonal and intrapsychic adaptiveness of trait self-enhancement: A mixed blessing. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 1197-1208. An additional consideration; narcissists tend to favor short term benefit over long term, thus raters of performance that are close to them (such as peers) rate them lower than raters that have known them for a shorter period of time. Other related behaviors of narcissism, namely of status seeking, include blatant fabrication and exaggeration during the interview process. Interviewers‚Äô initial impressions of narcissistic applicants are formed primarily on the basis of highly visible cues, which makes them susceptible to biases.Back, M.D., Schmukle, S.C., & Egloff, B. (2010). Why are narcissists so charming at first sight? Decoding the narcissism-popularity link at zero acquaintance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, 132-145. Narcissists are more skilled at displaying likable cues, which lead to more positive first impressions, regardless of their long-term likability or job performance. Upon first meeting narcissists, people often rate them as more agreeable, competent, open, entertaining, and well-adjusted. Narcissists also tend to be neater and flashier dressers, display friendlier facial expressions, and exhibit more self-assured body movements.Berscheid, E., & Reis, H. T. (1998). Attraction and close relationships. Importantly, while narcissistic individuals may rate their own job performance more favorably, studies show that narcissism is not related to job performance.Campbell, W. K., Hoffman, B. J., Campbell, S. M., & Marchisio, G. (2011). Narcissism in organizational contexts. Human Resource Management Review, 21(4), 268-284. Openness and conscientiousness are also related to higher self-ratings (than other-rated), along with narcissism. The link between conscientiousness and higher self-views can be explained because it is prosocial and one is more likely to experience self-deception (at around the same amount as narcissists). The connection to openness has yet to be explained. Thus, while narcissists may seem to perform better and even be rated as performing better in interviews, these more favorable interview ratings are not predictive of favorable job performance, as narcissists do not actually perform better in their jobs than non-narcissists. Impact on stress, absenteeism and staff turnover There tends to be a higher level of stress with people who work with or interact with a narcissist. While there are a variety of reasons for this to be the case, an important one is the relationship between narcissism and aggression. Aggression is believed to moderate the relationship between narcissism and counterproductive work behaviors. Penney and Spector found narcissism to be positively related to counterproductive workplace behaviors, such as interpersonal aggression, sabotaging the work of others, finding excuses to waste other peoples' time and resources, and spreading rumors.Penney, L. M., & Spector, P. E. (2002, June). Narcissism and Counterproductive WorkBehavior: Do Bigger Egos Mean Bigger Problems? Retrieved February 24, 2018, from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2389.00199/epdf These aggressive acts can raise the stress of other employees,Colligan, T. W., & Higgins, E. M. (2006). Workplace Stress. Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health, 21(2), 89-97. doi:10.1300/j490v21n02_07 which in turn increases absenteeism and staff turnover.Thomas, David. Narcissism: Behind the Mask (2010) Organizational Design Preferences  Narcissists like hierarchical organizations because they think they will rise to high ranks and reap status and power. They take special interest in acquiring leadership positions and may be better at procuring them. Narcissists are less interested in hierarchies where there is little opportunity for upward mobility.Zitek E, Jordan A Research: Narcissists Don‚Äôt Like Flat Organizations Harvard Business Review 27 Jul 2016 The prototypical narcissist is more concerned with getting praised and how they are perceived than doing what benefits all of the \\"stakeholders\\". Some narcissistic attributes may confer benefits, but the negative and positive outcomes of narcissistic leadership are not yet fully understood. In terms of the internal functioning of organizations, narcissists can be especially damaging, or ill-fit, to jobs that require judicious self assessment, heavily rely on teams, and/or use 360 degree feedback. Corporate narcissism According to Alan Downs, corporate narcissism occurs when a narcissist becomes the chief executive officer (CEO) (or another leadership role) within the senior management team and gathers an adequate mix of codependents around him or her to support the narcissistic behavior. Narcissists profess company loyalty but are only really committed to their own agendas; thus, organizational decisions are founded on the narcissist's own interests rather than the interests of the organization as a whole, the various stakeholders, or the society in which the organization operates.Downs, Alan: Beyond The Looking Glass: Overcoming the Seductive Culture of Corporate Narcissism, 1997 As a result, a certain kind of charismatic leader can run a financially successful company on thoroughly unhealthy principles (at least for a time).Robin Skynner/John Cleese, Life and how to survive it (London 1994) p. 101 Neville Symington has suggested that one of the ways of differentiating a good-enough organisation from one that is pathological is through its ability to exclude narcissistic characters from key posts.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2004) p. 10 Narcissistic supply The narcissistic manager will have two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate (status symbols like cars, gadgets or office views); and animate (flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates).A. J. DuBrin, Narcissism in the Workplace (2012) p. 143 Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries.A. J. DuBrin, Narcissism in the Workplace (2012) p. 143 and p. 181 The narcissistic manager's need to protect such supply networks will prevent objective decision-making.S. Allcorn, Organizational Dynamics and Intervention (2005) p. 105 Such a manager will evaluate long-term strategies according to their potential for gaining personal attention instead of to benefit the organization.A. J. DuBrin, Narcissism in the Workplace (2012) p. 122 Coping strategies for dealing with workplace narcissists DuBrin suggests the following coping strategies:A. J. DuBrin, Narcissism in the Workplace: Research, Opinion and Practice (2012)) p. 197 * Assess the relationship realistically * Maintain your professionalism and composure * Confront conflict gently and tactfully * Document your accomplishments * Be willing to accept criticism * Maintain a strong network Workplace bullying overlap In 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, found that narcissism revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). Studies of adolescents using self- reports and teacher evaluation also indicated that narcissists are more likely to integrate aggressive and confrontational behaviors due to low self- esteem.Washburn et al. 2004 Narcissistic Features in Young Adolescents: Relations to Aggression and Internalizing Symptoms Kerig & Stellwagen, 2010 Roles of callous-unemotional traits, narcissism, and machiavellianism in childhood aggression The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.Catherine Mattice, MA & Brian Spitzberg, PhD Bullies in Business: Self-Reports of Tactics and Motives San Diego State University, 2007 Despite the fact that many narcissist will avoid work, they can be eager to steal the work of others. In line with other dark triad traits, many narcissists will manipulate others and their environment so that they can claim responsibility for company accomplishments that they had little or nothing to do with. A study was done in 2017, that looked at dark traits within those who hold leadership positions and that effect on employee depression. The research done supported the idea that employees mental health and stability was negatively effected by bullying (some narcissistic behavior) in the workplace. Sexual harassment There are strong links between narcissism and sexual harassment, associated with ego centrism and willingness to exploit others. According to RAINN, (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) sexual harassment can cause mental, physical, and emotional health problems that can include: a diverse range of emotions, anxiety, depression, PTSD, sleep problems, substance abuse and an increase in stress levels. Additional research has also been done that directly correlates narcissism with a proclivity to engage in sexual harassment. Relevant correlations include sociosexuality, unrestricted sexuality, and extroversion. A study was done in 2010, that looked at Sexual Narcissism and the Perpetration of Sexual Aggression. The results showed a relationship between sexual narcissism and a tendency for sexual aggression in the future, suggesting that there is a strong relationship between sexual narcissism and sexual assault. The study also found that men who exhibited certain elements of narcissism were more likely to carry out sexual aggression. This could potentially be used to pinpoint and even treat sexual aggression. Productive narcissists Crompton has distinguished what he calls productive narcissists from unproductive narcissists.Simon Crompton, All about me (London 2007) pp. 157‚Äì58 Maccoby acknowledged that productive narcissists still tend to be over-sensitive to criticism, over-competitive, isolated, and grandiose, but considered that what draws them out is that they have a sense of freedom to do whatever they want rather than feeling constantly constrained by circumstances, and that through their charisma they are able to draw people into their vision, and produce a cohort of disciples who will pursue the dream for all it's worth.Maccoby M The Productive Narcissist (2003)Crompton, p. 158 Others have questioned the concept, considering that the dramatic collapse of Wall Street and the financial system in 2009 must give us pause. Is the collapse due to business leaders who have developed narcissistic styles‚Äîeven if ostensibly productive?Jay R. Slosar, The Culture of Excess (2009) p. 7 Certainly one may conclude that at best there can be quite a fine line between narcissists who perform badly in the workplace because of their traits, and those who achieve outrageous success because of them.Crompton, p. 159 In fiction * Sheldon Cooper * Larry David * Gordon Gekko * Gregory House See also References Further reading * Gerald Falkowski, Jean Ritala Narcissism in the Workplace (2007) * Samuel Grier Narcissism in the Workplace: What It Is - How To Spot It - What To Do About It (2011) * Belinda McDaniel The Narcissists in Your Life: Coping with and Surviving Narcissists in the Workplace, at Home and Wherever You Are Forced to Associate with People Suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (2014) * Sam Vaknin, Lidija Rangelovska The Narcissist and the Psychopath in the Workplace (2006) External links * Anna Verasai Dealing With Different Types of Narcissists at Work The HR Digest 28 Jul 2016 * Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic Why We Keep Hiring Narcissistic CEOs Harvard Business Review 29 Nov 2016 Category:Human resource management Category:Narcissism Category:Positions of authority Category:Workplace Category:Workplace bullying ","title":"Narcissism in the workplace"},{"id":"43053077","text":"Gink Scootere is the fifth studio album by King Creosote.

The dialogue often breaks the fourth wall and its style is self-referential in nature. Enter the Dominatrix draws on its history as originally produced as downloadable content for the game's predecessor, Saints Row: The Third. It was first announced on April Fool's Day in 2012, later confirmed, and then cancelled to be incorporated into Saints Row IV, which drew on some aspects of the original idea and left the rest for this downloadable content. It was released on October 22, 2013 to mixed or average reviews. Critics appreciated the pack's treatment of its own history, what Eurogamer Chris Schilling called a \\"very postmodern conceit\\".  Gameplay  Enter the Dominatrix tells an alternative story on the Zin invasion of Saints Row IV where the simulation of Steelport is hijacked by a rogue artificial intelligence called the Dominatrix. The pack draws on its origins as Saints Row: The Third downloadable content that was later delayed and repackaged. It also frequently breaks the fourth wall‚Äîits story's incongruence with the larger Saints Row story is a recurring theme, where the characters self-referentially acknowledge the plot holes. The story advances through cutscene clips presented as \\"unseen footage\\" found by television journalist Jane Valderama, as \\"what could have been\\". Some scenes end in concept art or videos of Volition employees acting out the drama so as to give the game an unfinished feel. The pack also casts characters from Saints Row: The Third who did not return in the sequel. The player fights the Dominatrix‚Äîwho appears as a cross between Maleficent and a sex worker‚Äîseveral times. Other missions include using telekinesis to cage furries at a sex club and a BDSM chariot race. There are five missions in total. The pack introduces new weapons such as a heavy minigun, a flamethrower, a grenade launcher, new vehicles, and new computer- controlled support characters (\\"homies\\"). Up to two players can play cooperatively.  Plot  The 3rd Street Saints and the Zin warlord Zinyak are being interviewed about the deleted scenes of Enter the Dominatrix. One year after the alternate \\"Kill Killbane\\" ending of Saints Row: The Third (although Saints lieutenant Shaundi is shown to have somehow survived), the Saints are still ruling over Steelport, with lieutenant Pierce Washington having been elected mayor. One day, however, Zin forces commanded by Zinyak invade the city, but the Saints fight them off. After Josh Birk sacrifices himself to kill a giant cyclops summoned by Zinyak, the Boss tracks him down and kills him, repelling the invasion. However, following Zinyak's death, an AI created by the Zin, known as the \\"Dominatrix\\", takes over his empire and transports the Saints into a simulation of Steelport, under her control. The Saints work to defeat the Dominatrix, recruiting several allies and fighting her army of men in gimp suits, eventually weakening her to the point she summons a giant can named \\"Paul\\" to wreak havoc in Steelport. The Saints are able to build a spaceship to go inside Paul and destroy its brain, killing it, after which the Boss confronts and defeats the Dominatrix. With the Dominatrix dead, d'Artagnan, a servant of the Raptor King Cirano, approaches the Saints and brings them before Cirano, who agrees to help them return to the real world. Once there, Shaundi becomes Cirano's queen and the Boss goes bowling with Cirano, securing peace between humans and Raptors.  Development  THQ announced an Enter the Dominatrix standalone expansion for Saints Row: The Third as an April Fool's joke in 2012. It was confirmed as in development the next month, with the basic plot where the alien commander Zinyak imprisons the Saints' leader in The Dominatrix simulation of Steelport so as to prevent interference when he takes over the planet. The expansion also was to add superpowers for the player character. In June, THQ said the expansion would be wrapped into a full sequel, tentatively titled \\"The Next Great Sequel in the Saints Row Franchise\\" and scheduled for release in 2013. The parts of that expansion that weren't incorporated into the sequel (Saints Row IV) were later released as this downloadable content for the new title. It was developed by Volition, published by Deep Silver, and released October 22, 2013. Enter the Dominatrix was followed by the \\"How the Saints Saved Christmas\\" downloadable content pack. High Voltage Software ported the full game and all of its downloadable content to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as Saints Row 4: Re- Elected, which was released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later. A Linux port is planned for release in 2015.  Reception  Enter the Dominatrix received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Chris Schilling of Eurogamer, citing the game's development history, called Enter the Dominatrix \\"a fascinating case study in how games evolve\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly Eric Patterson also commented on how downloadable content in the industry is seen as content pulled from the retail release to be sold as an addition, which Enter the Dominatrix development history flips on its head. He added that in all of his industry experience, he had never otherwise seen a developer purposefully let its fans play \\"shelved\\" content, and thus found the experience \\"fascinating\\". Official Xbox Magazine Mikel Reparaz said it was fun to see what \\"could have been\\". Eurogamer Schilling called the self-referential nature of the release a \\"very postmodern conceit\\", which he thought worked well despite the dual faux pas of parodying The Matrix and overtly \\"satirizing game mechanics\\". He felt that the satire was not good, though the writing was \\"genuinely funny\\", and that the repeated Dominatrix fight scenes should not have felt as low budget. He recommended the pack for those who love \\"wry gags about creaky gaming tropes with the occasional belly laugh\\", and said he had a better time finding his own fun than playing through the missions. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that those who are looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.

Iterated forcing was introduced by in their construction of a model of set theory with no Suslin tree. They also showed that iterated forcing can construct models where Martin's axiom holds and the continuum is any given regular cardinal. In iterated forcing, one has a transfinite sequence PŒ± of forcing notions indexed by some ordinals Œ±, which give a family of Boolean- valued models VPŒ±. If Œ±+1 is a successor ordinal then PŒ±+1 is often constructed from PŒ± using a forcing notion in VPŒ±, while if Œ± is a limit ordinal then PŒ± is often constructed as some sort of limit (such as the direct limit) of the PŒ≤ for Œ≤<Œ±. A key consideration is that, typically, it is necessary that \\\\omega_1 is not collapsed. This is often accomplished by the use of a preservation theorem such as: * Finite support iteration of c.c.c. forcings (see countable chain condition) are c.c.c. and thus preserve \\\\omega_1. * Countable support iterations of proper forcings are proper (see Fundamental Theorem of Proper Forcing) and thus preserve \\\\omega_1. * Revised countable support iterations of semi-proper forcings are semi-proper and thus preserve \\\\omega_1.

The east wing and the octagonal tower overlooking the waters of Vomme S√∏ date from 1596. The north wing was erected as a half-timbered structure in 1672 and completed in brick in 1757. Description It has been established that in 1326 Niels Jensen was the owner of S√∏g√•rd and of a series of farms in the area. He was buried in the local church. Some south of today's manor, there is a defensive site consisting of a hill and a moat which was apparently the first S√∏gard. The Crown had extensive interests in the area as Tvevad Castle, documented by Valdemar the Great, lay just 2 km to the south. The medieval castle can still be seen in Tvevadskov (Tvevad Woods). The S√∏g√•rd estate came into the Crown's ownership before the end of the 14th century. In 1537, just after the Danish Reformation, S√∏g√•rd together with 16 farms is recorded as belonging to the Crown as well as two of the parish's three water mills. In 1577, Frederick II rewarded his steward Casper Markdanner with a deed for S√∏g√•rd and part of the R√∏nninge estate. After marrying Sofie Oldeland in 1592, Markdanner set about building a presentable two-storey manor house with a vaulted cellar, commanding a fine view over the lake. The estate was also expanded although it remained a fairly modest property. Ulrica Catharina Mylius, n√©e Rasch The estate remained in the hands of the Markdanner family until Frederik Markdanner, Casper's great-grandchild, died in 1677. Thereafter there were various owners. In 1757, a new wing was added in the same style as the original manor. Together with the main building, it formed an almost rectangular complex. In 1823, R√∏nninge S√∏g√•rd was acquired by Ulrika Cathrine de Mylius (n√©e Rasch). After her death in 1731, it was passed to her son Johan Caspar Mylius. He was ennobled under the name de Mylius on 14 October 1840. The estate remained in the Mylius family until 1906. In 1860, at the end of Vomme S√∏, an octagonal burial chapel was built for the de Mylius's family in 1900-2018 Later it has been bought by various big farmers. Today The estate is now owned by chamberlain, count Stig Daniel Bille-Brahe-Selby. The estate was purchased for his grandfather, Daniel, a younger son from the County of Brahesminde with the main seat at Hvedholm Castle.

Early life and career  Tolman was born August 15, 1956, and raised in Northern California. His father was a sheep rancher, and his mother was a former burlesque dancer who worked during World War II as a \\"Rosie the Riveter\\". He is the grandson of noted psychologist Edward C. Tolman, and great-nephew of Manhattan Project physicist Richard C. Tolman. While attending school at University of California, Davis, Tolman was a DJ at the student radio station KDVS, where he met a pre-Dream Syndicate Steve Wynn and Kendra Smith, who were also disc jockeys at the station. Together in 1978 they formed Suspects, which was touted as Davis's first New Wave band. Answering a classified ad in The California Aggie was drummer Gavin Blair (who would later be lead singer in True West) and bassist Steve Suchil. Active until 1980, when Wynn and Smith returned to Southern California to attend UCLA, Suspects played many of the Northern California punk and new wave venues of the day including San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens and The Deaf Club and UC Davis's Coffeehouse. They released a 45 RPM single, \\"Talking Loud\\" b/w \\"It's Up To You,\\" in 1979. Following the breakup of Suspects, Tolman began playing with Sean O'Brien in The Meantime, which also featured bassist Rick Gates, son of David Gates of Bread. The elder Gates produced Tolman's song \\"Two For One\\" for the band's self-released 7\\" EP in 1981. From 1979 until 1983, Tolman worked as a disc jockey at progressive country station KYLO in Davis, where he developed a love for classic honky tonk, western swing, and folk under the tutelage of music director Gordy Broshear, formerly of genre pioneers KFAT. By 1982, The Meantime had changed their name to True West and Gavin Blair had replaced Sean O'Brien as lead singer. The band went on to coalesce around Blair, Tolman, and guitarist Richard McGrath and record two well received albums, which allowed the band to tour constantly in the US and Europe from 1983 through early summer 1985, including accompanying R.E.M. as opening act on their Fables of the Reconstruction tour. In summer 1985, True West and Tolman parted ways.  Solo recording career  Tolman started work on his first solo album Totem Poles And Glory Holes, which was released in 1986 on UK label Zippo/Demon Records. The album was released in the U.S. the next year on Down There/Restless Records and received many positive reviews including being named New York Times music critic Robert Palmer's \\"Rock Album of the Week\\" in the May 29, 1987 Times, as well as making that writer's and many other's year- end \\"Best Of\\" list. Tolman left Davis for Los Angeles at the end of summer 1986, where he helped manage Steve Wynn's Down There Records label, releasing albums by Tolman, The Romans, Divine Weeks, Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs, Doctor's Children, and others via a distribution deal with successful independent label Restless Records. Tolman did his first U.S. tour with a band that featured bassist David Provost (Dream Syndicate, The Droogs, Phil Seymour, Holly and the Italians), former True West drummer Frank French (later of Cake), and San Francisco guitarist Jeff Kane. In 1988, Tolman recorded Down In Earthquake Town, which was the first of a series of albums he made at Westbeach Recorders with engineer (and sometimes co-producer and co-writer) Brett Gurewitz, founder of Bad Religion and Epitaph Records. This album was released in Europe on Zippo/Demon Records and in the U.S. on Skyclad Records. Tolman supported this album with a U.S. tour with a band that included keyboardist Robert Lloyd, bassist Brian Mazur, guitarist Jeff Kane, and drummer Dave Drewry. Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, credited as the Strawberry Neapolitan Singers, lends background vocals to the album. Tolman makes vocal noises on the title song of Concrete Blonde's 1989 album Free. Goodbye Joe was released in 1990 on Skyclad Records and on France's New Rose Records. The record was recorded at Westbeach Recorders with the nucleus of bass player Provost and drummer Drewry, then fleshed out with the contributions of lead guitarist Jon Klages (The Individuals, The Richard Lloyd Band) and multi-instrumentalist Robert Lloyd. It was after the release of this album that Tolman began frequent tours in Europe joining Steve Wynn and his band as solo opener for their 1990 tour of France, Spain, and Italy. Tolman particularly was drawn to Scandinavia, looking to relocate to Oslo, Norway. With this plan in mind, Tolman based his recording band for 1992's Road Movie around drummer Ned Leukhardt (Wall of Voodoo) who had relocated to Scandinavia with the demise of Wall of Voodoo in 1988. With Brett Gurewitz in the co- producer's chair, the album features a core band of Leukhardt on drums, bassist David Provost, Jon Klages on guitar with guest appearances by Green on Red's Chris Cacavas on organ, Robert Lloyd on mandolin and accordion, Chris Bauer steel guitar, and The Long Ryders's Sid Griffin on backing vocals. The album was released in Europe on New Rose Records. Around this time, Tolman toured Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark with John Wesley Harding. Earlier, he had done a winter tour of Spain with Harding, Steve Wynn, Chris Cacavas, and Giant Sand. In 1992, Russ contributed background vocals on Steve Wynn's album Dazzling Display. Sweet Spot was Tolman's fourth album released 1994 on his own Brilliant label via several European record companies including PIAS. Once again recorded in Los Angeles at Westbeach Recorders, Sweet Spot featured a band that included guitarist Kirk Swan (Dumptruck), drummer Dave Drewry, bass player Nino Del Pesco, multi-instrumentalist Robert Lloyd (Steve Wynn, John Wesley Harding, Carlene Carter, Amy Rigby), and Canadian vocalist Wendy Bird (Barney Bentall). Tolman, along with Kirk Swan, Wendy Bird, and bassist Spike Priggen, embarked on an acoustic European tour to support Sweet Spot that included Scandinavia, France, Spain, and Italy. Late in 1996, Tolman left Los Angeles for San Francisco. Living in the Mission District, he wrote his next album City Lights. During this time he made frequent trips to Portland, Oregon to work with songwriter/drummer Jim Huie on Huie's Girls Say Yes project that featured Huie's songwriting and drumming with vocals by Huie and several other Portland artists. Notably, True West guitarist Richard McGrath lends his considerable guitar talents to the project. Canadian songstress Wendy Bird also appears. The album was recorded with engineer Mike Demmers at Desitrek Studios. Tolman would later go on to record and mix part of his City Lights at this studio. City Lights was also recorded in San Francisco with engineer Chris Von Sneidern with Steve Wynn co- producing several songs that include Linda Pitmon on drums, pianist Robert Lloyd, and Doug Freeman on bass. Guitarist Jeff Kane (who died from cancer in 2012) also participated in the album, both playing guitar and engineering overdubs. The album was mastered by the late Doug Sax and released on Germany's Blue Rose Records in 1998. Tolman followed up the City Lights release with two tours of Europe. First in May and June 1998, he was solo opening act for The Cole Porters featuring his friend Sid Griffin playing in Germany and the UK. Tolman returned for a Fall 1998 tour with a band that featured guitarist Jeff Kane, drummer Jim Huie, and Portland bass player Roland Couture. It was on this tour in Cologne, Germany that Tolman met his future wife Kim Assing (now noted Hollywood production designer Kim A. Tolman). In addition to songwriting and performing, Tolman has a keen interest in music production, having produced records for Barbara Manning's first band 28th Day, The Windbreakers, The Downsiders, The Popealopes, Lost Durangos, and others. In 1998, he started Innerstate Records, along with Pat Thomas. The label was active in the San Francisco Bay Area till 2006 with nearly 100 releases and spawned offshoot labels InnerSpace and WEED (which released albums by Thomas's band Mushroom). During the early 2000s, Tolman also worked as a reissue producer, overseeing re-releases from Willie Nelson, Bob Marley, Waylon Jennings, Lead Belly, Patsy Cline, and others. In 2000, Tolman released New Quadraphonic Highway, which he recorded almost entirely in his Haight Ashbury district bedroom. It featured guest appearances by John Wesley Harding, Chuck Prophet, Tom Heyman, and Dale Duncan of Map of Wyoming and Flying Color. In 2006, Tolman joined Gavin Blair, Richard McGrath, and True West newcomers Jim Huie, and bassist Ian Barrett for a series of True West reunion shows, which included several dates as opening act for old friends Violent Femmes, playing at venues such as San Francisco's legendary Fillmore Ballroom and the House of Blues at Downtown Disney, Anaheim. In 2011, Tolman and wife Kim left the SF Bay Area to relocate in Los Angeles. Tolman reformed the Russ Tolman Band shortly after, featuring Kirk Swan on guitar, drummer Dave Drewry, Robert Lloyd on organ, bassist Dave Provost, and new addition Carl Byron on piano. They recorded and released the digital single \\"Los Angeles\\" in 2013. In 2016, Tolman released the singles \\"Time Flies,\\" \\"Everybody's Gonna Love Me,\\" and \\"Vancouver Sun\\" on the 304 Stainless label. Tolman released in 2017 a 20-song, 27-year retrospective album (CD and digital) entitled Compass & Map that covers the years 1986 to 2013 and includes songs from his previous seven albums, plus the best of his digital singles. In 2019, Tolman's eighth solo album Goodbye El Dorado was released. Personal life In 2000, Tolman married Kim Assing (now Kim A. Tolman) in Cologne, Germany.

The trail was known as the Great Wagon Road by colonial travelers; it went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later was renamed Monocacy Road. Early surviving historical records indicate that Monocacy was the oldest settlement in Western Maryland. The town is believed to have been located near present- day Creagerstown, but never has been precisely located after its complete abandonment in the early 19th century. There are signs of the town's existence going back as far as 1730. History From the earliest historical records, Monocacy, Maryland is considered the oldest settlement in Western Maryland founded in the 1720s. The town was settled near the Monocacy Trail, an old Indian trail that ran along the Monocacy River. According to some sources the name of Monocacy was not linked to a definitive town but to the settlement area of the Monocacy Valley where Moravian Germans coming from the colony of Pennsylvania had arrived. If Monocacy was referring to the valley of the same name, it encompassed the region of 18th century Frederick County, Maryland settlements, which included Frederick Town founded in 1745. The earliest Monocacy settlement that was recorded most likely existed between 1721 and 1732 and was composed of European-American traders from the colony of Maryland who ran a trading post and who co-existed with the local Native American tribes in Frederick County, Maryland. In 1729, German settlers arrived in what later became Frederick County in 1748 then a part of the British colonial Province of Maryland. The first settlement created by the settlers of the county was Monocacy, which was founded between 1725 and 1730, making it the oldest settlement in Western Maryland. The town was settled nearby the Monocacy Trail, an old Indian trail that ran along the Monocacy River. In 1730, the Monocacy Trail was made into a wagon road. In its early days, Monocacy was the main settlement within the region of early Frederick County. The early dominance of the town of Monocacy or the other Monocacy settlements in the Monocacy Valley eventually was overtaken by the later founding and rapid growth of Frederick Town, now present-day Frederick, Maryland. Other sources state that between 1732 and 1734, a church known as \\"the Log church\\" was built in what may have been the single town site of the early German settlement of Monocacy. Moravian Church missionaries visited the area regularly, and many of the people of \\"Manakasy,\\" referring to the Native American tribe as the Moravians spelled it in their records, often visited the Maryland Moravian Settlements from nearby Pennsylvania. By the time the log church was built, the village of Monocacy was somewhat important to the area. The town had a number of taverns and other places to sleep. \\"As late as 1747, it possessed accommodations better than those of Frederick.\\" Sometime between 1760 and 1770, the nearby town of Creagerstown supplanted Monocacy because it was a better location for town being at the crossroads of a number of early Maryland roads, which gave easier access for stagecoach travelers and enabled town growth. By 1808, Monocacy Road was macadamized creating a more reliable heavily traveled highway. Between 1732 and 1734, \\"the Log church\\" in Monocacy was built then a part of the British colonial Province of Maryland and was a regular destination for Moravian missionaries from the Province of Pennsylvania. It has been alleged by an 1896 account that Creagerstown, Maryland was built on the former site of the old log church. The Monocacy log church may have looked similar to this early structure in Pennsylvania. Creagerstown, Maryland was alleged according to an 1896 source to have been built on the former site of the old log church in Monocacy. Photo from 2016 Search for town site As early as 1896, knowledge of the location of the town had been lost. In 1896, Rev. George A. Whitmore, a resident of Thurmont, wrote upon interviewing two residents of Creagerstown who were in \\"bordering on 80 years\\" about the location of the Log Church, he had been told that Creagerstown was built on the old location of the church. Whitmore mentions that one of the people he interviewed, Mr. W.L. Grimes Sr., actually helped tear down the Log church so that the new church could be built in its place. Whitmore goes on to say that traditional lore states though that the town of Monocacy is located to the southeast of Creagerstown at the intersection of Monocacy Road and Poe's Ford nearby Hunting Creek. Both Whitmore and his contemporary Mr. Schultz investigated the site and found flat land with a few dwellings. In a history of Frederick County, Mr. Schultz is quoted as saying that the location to the southeast of Creagerstown \\"agrees in every particular with the data that we have heretofore been able to obtain and I therefore believe that the few old houses and the graveyard are all perhaps that remain of the ancient village of Monocacy.\\" In the late 1960s, Charlotte Hearthly, then a senior in high school, mounted a search for the site. Many locals believe that their land parcels were the site of Monocacy. Much of the evidence for where Monocacy is located has been destroyed. Spencer Geasey speaks of a location where there was a school, a cemetery, and some other log buildings. He states that the area was developed and that a dig in this location would not prove useful. There is no doubt that the town existed. In August 1756, George Washington mentions Monocacy in a letter. Two different riding ministers both wrote about the log church at different times. They were riding trails about 10 miles north of Frederick. During the French and Indian War, the site was mentioned in the Maryland Gazette. In 1729, a complaint was filed by a Mr. Carroll with the Pennsylvania government that referenced Monocacy. The complaint was filed because the area was under dispute by Maryland and Pennsylvania. The town was located near Creagerstown and Jimtown. According to Paul Gordon, one expert has stated that the Sebastian Derr house may have been a church and might be the old site of Monocacy. The site of Monocacy never has been conclusively located. There is a lot of evidence that the settlement existed, but not a enough tangible evidence as to where the town was actually located. In the media In 1999, a documentary film about the region, titled Monocacy, chronicles the history and pre-history of the area and the town. The documentary was produced by Chris Haugh for GS Communications.

Starscape) Cover art by Jon Foster Dragon and Liberator is the final book of Timothy Zahn's Dragonback series. It is divided into two sub-plots: one depicting Jack (a former burglar, 14 years old) and sidekick Draycos (a dragon-like entity periodically assuming two-dimensional form upon Jack's skin) opposing the criminal alliance intent on rendering Draycos's species extinct, and the other depicting Alison (an industrial spy of Jack's age) and her partner Taneem (a female of Draycos's species) in captivity. Both sub-plots occur largely on faster-than-light spaceships en route to an unidentified destination. Publication history The novel was first published in 2008 by Tom Doherty and Associates, New York. Plot Attempting to learn the location in space at which their enemies plan to destroy Draycos's compatriots and their humanoid symbionts, the Shontine people, Alison and Taneem are attacked and conceal themselves in the safe containing the location's record. Jack, trying to rescue them, is imprisoned for vehicle theft. He is rescued by the soldier Harper (sometime bodyguard to industrialist Cornelius Braxton, apparent in the first book of the series). In the safe, Alison speculates that Taneem and Draycos's ancestors were genetically engineered on Earth, by ancient astronauts or a lost civilization, to accompany humans; this becomes important later in the book. Having escaped the safe aboard an interstellar spacecraft, Alison and Taneem spy on their enemies and attempt minor sabotage of relations among the same. On the (fictional) planet Bentren, Jack and Draycos capture a spacecraft purchased by their enemies and therein infiltrate the hostile fleet, to sabotage the mission itself‚Äì‚Äìchiefly by destroying the enemy's supreme weapon, located aboard the principal spacecraft. The weapon, called simply the Death, is described as a 'vibration of space' capable of penetrating all physical barriers and of instantaneously annulling its target's entire metabolism. Meanwhile, Harper, having ingratiated himself with the enemies' commanders, assists Taneem in espionage on them. Jack and Draycos, in turn, are assisted by Jonathan Langston, another soldier introduced in the previous book, Dragon and Judge. To delay and distract the enemy, Alison sabotages one of their spacecraft and presents herself to their leaders Col. Frost and Arthur Neverlin as the daughter of General Aram Davi, founder of the mercenary organization to which Frost belongs, while Harper shelters Taneem. When the mercenaries begin their attack on Draycos's people, Harper carries out a kamikaze strike in hope of exposing the Death to its intended victims; although this fails, Jack and Draycos re-create his attempt. Having unexpectedly survived, as the symbiosis of human and K'da (the name given, throughout the series, to Draycos's species) renders both immune to the Death, they transmit warnings to the friendly fleets including both the Shontine/K'da and Cornelius Braxton's own army (invited by Harper), which overcome Frost and Neverlin's forces. Alison is thereafter identified as Braxton's granddaughter, and Jack appointed Braxton's liaison to the K'da and Shontine.

It was preceded by the 1907 election and followed by the 1913 election. Overview of the Result As in most parts of Wales, the Liberal Party was once again triumphant and won a majority of the seats. The Conservatives made a further advance in the western part of the county where they also held on in a number of industrial wards where the influence of paternalism remained strong. A more striking factor was the advance of Labour candidates in several areas and there were also a number of Liberal members who were returned under a 'progressive' banner with support from the labour movement. Boundary Changes There were numerous boundary changes resulting from the secession of Merthyr Tydfil from Glamorgan to create a new County Borough. There were boundary changes at Maesteg, leading to the creation of a second seat. Retiring Aldermen All eleven retiring aldermen were Liberals, or Lib-Lab members as the Conservatives and their allies had been denied any seats on the aldermanic bench since 1901.

A lifelong Episcopalian, he was ordained a priest of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America at age 69, and ministered to his people until shortly before his death. The Oneida, one of the five founding tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, had aligned with the Americans during the American Revolutionary War, but when faced with pressure from white settlers who often mistook them for members of hostile tribes, had begun negotiating with the Ho-Chunk and Menominee tribes and moving to Wisconsin around 1821. Many members had become Christians under missionaries sent by the Episcopal and Methodist Churches to both New York and Wisconsin. In 1825, tribal members built a log church near the Fox River and an important portage on their new lands about 10 miles southwest of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which they called the Hobart Chapel after its consecrating bishop, John Henry Hobart of New York. Early life Cornelius Hill was born on tribal lands in Wisconsin and baptised in due course by missionary bishop Jackson Kemper. In 1843, Episcopal missionary the Rev. James Lloyd Breck escorted the ten-year- old and two other boys to the newly established Nashotah House to learn English and be educated for five years. Chief Hill Career As a teenager, at a council of Oneida from New York, Canada and Wisconsin, Hill became a chief of his Bear Clan. At age 18 he was given responsibility for distributing the annuity money (from service in the Revolutionary War)Julia K. Bloomfield, The Oneidas (New York: Alden, 1907), 380 among his people. He was later responsible for taking the census of tribal members (the number of which doubled in Wisconsin in the five decades of his leadership). Several times Hill went to Albany, New York and Washington, D.C. to advocate for his people. White settlers were also moving into Wisconsin, and coveted tribal lands, which were held in common under an 1838 treaty negotiated by Chief Daniel Bread, who by his death in 1873 thought such private allocation inevitable. The next year, Hill drafted a petition to New York's legislature in Albany concerning interference with Oneida fishing rights under previous treaties, which was causing considerable hardship to tribal members remaining in New York. At least one Indian Agent supposedly assigned to help the tribe also forbade them to sell shingles and other lumber products to support themselves during a crop failure, which Hill and missionary and teacher the Rev. Edward A. Goodnough (who worked among the Oneidas from 1863 to 1890) thought was designed to get the tribe to sell lands to whites (if not his cronies), and eventually managed to secure that agent's dismissal.Bloomfield, pp. 246-249, 280-281, 286-88 Hill also helped tribal members learn new farming techniques and secure machinery. Women also made baskets and beadwork for sale, and after 1900 learned to make lace to support themselves in the modernized world. Nonetheless, pursuant to the Dawes Act of 1887, the federal government allocated the tribe's Wisconsin land to individuals beginning in 1892, who were to be allowed to transfer that property after a 25-year waiting period. As had happened in New York State, unscrupulous persons often tried to swindle tribal members out of their allocations. Throughout his life, Hill fought such dismemberment of tribal property, as well as government attempts to move his people further west.Bloomfield pp. 327-28 In 1893 after negotiations with the federal government, Hill, together with the Rev. Solomon S. Burleson (also a lawyer and doctor), secured a hospital and boarding school for the reservation, and the following year the Sisters of the Holy Nativity sent nuns to work as nurses and teachers there.Bloomfield p. 335 Hobart Church Having for years served as an organist and interpreter for Episcopal services by the Rev. Goodnough and his successors, as well as his tribe's sachem and delegate to church councils, Hill thought ordination would bring additional authority among whites as well as help him become a bridge between the cultures. Since 1870 (perhaps in Thanksgiving for having been relatively spared from horrendous forest fires that devastated Wisconsin), church members had volunteered at a limestone quarry one day a week, in order to dress stone for a new church building. In 1886 they laid the cornerstone for a new gothic stone chapel, which they named the Church of the Holy Apostles, to replace an overly small and somewhat decrepit wood chapel. On June 27, 1895, Bishop Charles C. Grafton ordained Hill a deacon. However, the event was bittersweet as Hill's infant son had died in an epidemic and was scheduled for burial that very afternoon.Bloomfield, pp. 329 Furthermore, his ally the Rev. Burleson died in February 1897, months before the new church's formal consecration, and Burleson's popular youngest son (all five of whom had become priests) was transferred to Texas the following year. On June 24, 1903, Bishop Grafton ordained Hill as a priest, the first of his people; during the ceremony Hill repeated his vows in his native language.Bloomfield pp. 330-334 The Wisconsin reservation also had a Methodist mission with a dedicated missionary and a Catholic chapel served by a priest from De Pere, about ten miles away.Bloomfield, p. 359 Family At the time of his ordination, aged 69, Hill's wife, who had borne 8 children, had not learned English. Several of their children went to the Hampton Indian School after their education at the reservation's school. Death and legacy Hill died on January 25, 1907, having fallen ill shortly before Christmas. After three requiems and funeral at the Church of the Holy Apostles attended by 800 persons, he was buried in the graveyard with other tribal members and the missionaries he assisted.Bloomfield pp. 387-95 When fire from a lightning strike on July 17, 1920 destroyed the Gothic stone church, it was rebuilt in a similar design. The Oneida continued to revere Hill's wisdom and sanctity, relating tales of their leader to Works Progress Administration historians during the Great Depression, even though by 1920 only a few hundred acres of the reservation were owned by tribal members (the remaining approximately 65,000 acres being owned by whites before the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 caused the Bureau of Indian Affairs to begin reversing the policy).Laurence A.

Fleeing west with 300 followers, he exploited the power vacuum in Syria to capture several cities, including Damascus. For the next three years, Alptakin withstood attempts by the Fatimid Caliphate to capture Damascus, until he was defeated and captured by Caliph al-Aziz Billah. Taken to Egypt and incorporated into the Fatimid army, he was poisoned by the vizier Ibn Killis shortly after.  Early life and rebellion against the Buyids  He was a freedman of the Buyid ruler of Iraq, Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar. Nothing further is known about him until 973, when he joined the rebellion of the Turkish officer Seb√ºk-Tegin, who managed to occupy Baghdad and many other parts of Iraq. The Turkish rebels under Seb√ºk-Tegin then besieged Wasit, where Izz al-Dawla had fortified himself. Seb√ºk-Tegin died during the siege, and Alptakin was shortly chosen as the new leader of the Turks. Meanwhile, a Buyid army under Izz al-Dawla's cousin Adud al-Dawla was marching towards Iraq, and by 975 managed to completely defeat the rebels at the Diyala River.  Invasion of Syria and war with the Fatimids  Map of Early Islamic Syria and its provinces After his defeat at the hands of the Buyids, along with of his followers, Alptakin fled to Syria, where they managed to capture Hims. Alptakin then allied himself with the Qarmatians, and in the winter of 975 invaded the Mediterranean coast and laid siege to Fatimid city of Sidon. He shortly managed to capture the city, resulting in the massacre of 4,000 Fatimid troops. He then captured Tiberias, and marched towards to Damascus, which he took without much resistance. The Fatimid caliph al-Aziz Billah then sent an army under his general Jawhar, who managed to reconquer the Mediterranean coast and reach as far as Damascus, which laid siege to in July 976. The Qarmatians reacted by sending an army to aid Alptakin‚Äîaccording to some sources, Alptakin himself appealed to the Qarmatians for aid‚Äîforcing Jawhar to lift the siege in January 977. The allies pursued Jawhar to Ramla, where they were joined by the Banu Tayy Bedouin; Jawhar was defeated in a pitched battle at the Yarqon River, and was forced to abandon Ramla and retreat to Ascalon. The Qarmatians entered Ramla on 12 March 977. The combined army of Alptakin and the Qarmatians then besieged Ascalon, where the Fatimid army had fled to. After a long siege which lasted until April 978, the starving Fatimid army agreed to make a peace treaty: in addition to Damascus, Alptakin would receive Palestine, while the northern border of the Fatimid domain was set at Gaza. To make the treaty more palatable to the Fatimids, Alptakin agreed to recognize the Fatimid caliph as his suzerain, although this was a purely nominal gesture: ALptakin would retain all revenue collected from the territories under his control. In 978, Izz al-Dawla, whose territories had been conquered by Adud al-Dawla, fled along with his two brothers and other Dailamite followers to Damascus, where they were warmly received by Alptakin, who incorporated the Dailamites into his army. Meanwhile, a new Fatimid army under al-Aziz himself was marching towards Damascus, and a battle ensued between the Turks and the Fatimids near Ramla; Alptakin charged the left wing of the Fatimids, killing many. However, the Fatimids turned the tide of the battle by making a counter-attack on the centre and right wing of Alptakin's army, killing of his men. Alptakin managed to flee from the battlefield to the desert, where he almost died of thirst, but was found by the leader of the Tayy tribe and an old friend of his, Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah. Alptakin was brought to the latter's home, where he was treated with honour. During his stay the latter's home, however, Mufarrij betrayed him and gave him to al-Aziz in exchange for 100,000 gold dinars. Alptakin was then taken to the Fatimid capital of Cairo, where he was honourably treated by al-Aziz, who incorporated Alptakin along with his Turkish followers into the Fatimid army. However, Alptakin was later poisoned by al-Aziz's vizier, Yaqub ibn Killis.

Biography Karapet Yeghiazaryuan was born in 1932 in Yerevan. The artistic depth of his nature was revealed in his childhood in his love towards nature, his perception of the beauty of its views and colors. He attended the painting group of the Ghoukassian Haouse of Pioneers (teacher Gagik Ghazaryan). *1953 graduated from Panos Terlemezyan Art College *1959 graduated from Leningrad Artistic Industrial High School after Mukhina *1972‚Äì1987 headed the section of decorative and applied arts of the RA Painter's Association *1973‚Äì1987 was a member of the Presidium and the Presidency of the RA Painter's Association *1962‚Äì1979 delivered lectures on design, painting and composition in the Terlemezyan Artistic College, for which in 1972 he was awarded an Honor Diploma of the Ministry of High and Secondary Special Education of the Armenian SSR, National Committee of Science and High School Education Workers *1964‚Äì1974 delivered lectures in the Yerevan Artistic and Theatrical Institute Karapet Yeghiazaryan's works are exhibited in art galleries, museum, well- known cultural centers and private collections of Yerevan, Gyumri, Echmiadzin, Moscow, London, New York City, Kerch, Volgodonsk and in many cities of Russian Federation, the city of Timirtau in Kazakhstan, as well as other countries. His daughter Anush Yeghiazaryan is the outstanding participant of the present stage of development of the Armenian tapestry.  Career  The personal style of Yeghiazaryan was formed progressively; his mastership grew year after year; skills shaping his own language in his works grew more perfect. The first attempts made by Yeghiazaryan were to introduce partial modifications in traditional oriental carpets. In these series of his work the most interesting is the tapestry Praying for Peace (1967), in which the author managed to put into natural connection human static figures with ornaments filling the entire surface of the work. The master organically transferred stylistic principles of the weaving art devices into the language of mosaics and obtained most interesting decorative effects, this time in the material of ‚Äòstone carpet‚Äô. Yeghiazaryan created works with logical structure which allows to read with precision the author's thought and to create a unique ornamental structural system. Along with strict compositional order, one feels in Yeghiazaryan's works the material, the wool, its softness, tenderness, density, its amazing capacity of absorbing light to entirely render the deepness and strength of color. Yeghiazaryan's frame of themes are : native Armenia, national traditions, events of social life and images of nature. Each new work was a further step leading to the solutions of image, contents and artistic problems.  Works  Karapet Yeghiazaryan is the author of numerous mosaic panels *Synthetics, 1967 *Paradise, 1968, for which he was awarded by a Diploma of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Armenian SSR, and which is now decorating the Memorial complex of the Sardarapat battle. *Grapes, 1969, now in the city of Artashat *The Sprout and the Sun, 1970, with co-authors M.

Azizyan, this huge composition is on the fa√ßade of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences. *Khachatur Abovyan, 1972, in the city of Abovyan, done from small multicolor pieces of natural stones. In this mosaic the painter managed to realize his innovation, beautifully joining the color to the texture of stone and metal, attempting to reach necessary artistic integrity. *Science, 1972 *Peace, 1975 *Victory Review, 1975 *Blossom, Our Lord, 1977, 140 m2, Usk-Kamenogorsk metallurgists‚Äô Palace of Culture. This is a three-part composition, the three main panels of which are done in the relief texture technique, while parts between them and the tapestry borders are done in flat technique. The relief technique of Yeghiazaryan has also a functional role. The themes of the three main panels are: in the left side- Center of Metallurgy, in the center-Science and Labor, in the right side-People are Cheerful, devoted to the development of arts and people talents. *History of Communication, 1977, performed on the fa√ßade and the end wall of the Yerevan Branch of the Soviet Project Institute of Communication (now Armentel). Above the main entrance of the building the mosaic triptych has a total surface of 400 m2. It is narrating the history of communication, science and astronautics. The mosaic is done from Armenian multicolor stones. *Soldier's Weeding, 1978 *Glory Firework (180 m2), 1978, curtain-tapestry for the city of Kerch *Stage of Great Way (180 m2), 1980, curtain-tapestry for the city of Komsomolsk *Electricity in the Mountains, 1982 *I am the Eye and You Are the Light, 1982 *To the Health, 1982 *Yard Tournament, 1982 *Abundance, 1983 *Song About Armenia, 1984 *Victorious Return, 1985 *Ode of Life, 1987 *Curtain Art (180 m2), 1989, for the city of Volgodonsk *Sacrificem 1992 *Three Graces, 1996 *Armenian Pilgrims, 1997 *Towards Light, 2003 *Requiem monumental panel, 2005, 9 m2, dedicated to the 1700th anniversary of the Adoption of Christianity in Armenia, done in a different style developing rather ideas of constructive design, than those of artistic textile; it was awarded by a special prize of the Armenian Church and an Honor Diploma of the Painter's Association of the RAKarapet Yeghiazaryan: tapestry, painting, mozaic  Exhibitions  Karapet Yeghioazaryan participated in numerous exhibitions, international symposiums and biennales, had his personal exhibitions in Armenia and abroad.  Quotes about Karapet Yeghiazaryan  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ in the mosaic made by Karapet Yeghiazaryan one can distinctly see carpet ornaments.

From 1970 to 1978, Hathaway, a Democrat, was his city's last public works commissioner,In Shreveport and in other cities with the commission form of government, the commissioner exercised legislative functions on the city council and an executive role as a municipal department head. This position should not be confused with a county commissioner, most of whom were and still are elected by single-member districts. County commissioners are the \\"legislators\\" of a county (called parish in Louisiana), with the county judge normally in the role of the \\"executive\\" head of the county. In Louisiana, the executive of the parish may be known as the police jury president, the president of the parish, or a parish \\"administrator\\", depending on the structure of the parish government. City commissioners could not be chosen on a district basis, as their administrative duties affected the entire city. African Americans were not then elected to city government in most parts of the South. Soon an outcry in the Civil rights movement raised legal challenges to the city commission governments. an office abolished effective November 1978 with the implementation of a new city charter. From 1980 to 2000, he was the sheriff of Caddo Parish in the northwestern corner of his state.Past sheriffs, Caddo Parish history (no longer on-line), accessed June 14, 2014 Background Hathaway is the younger and only surviving son of Jessie Oberdorfer and Oscar Clayton Hathaway, Sr. Don Hathaway attended the Alexander Grammar School in Shreveport through the seventh grade and then enrolled at St. John's College (later called St. John's Military High School), where he served as a lieutenant during his sophomore year. He graduated in 1946 from the public C. E. Byrd High School in Shreveport, at which he lettered in basketball and baseball. In 2000, he was inducted into the Byrd High School Hall of Fame, along with the songwriter Tillman Franks and B. L. \\"Buddy\\" Shaw, a former Byrd principal who served in both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature. Hathaway served in the United States Navy and later retired as a lieutenant. Hathaway subsequently was the student body president of Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, from which in 1951, he received a degree in Business Administration. Hathaway is a former member, officer, and president of the Louisiana Tech Alumni Association\\"Louisiana Tech Alumni Association officer\\", The Shreveport Times, October 16, 1957 and was the original secretary-treasurer in 1962 of the Louisiana Tech Foundation and the second president, whose membership included later state circuit court Judge Charles A. Marvin. In 2012, Hathaway was part of the fundraising campaign for the renovation of the floor and the renaming of the Robert \\"Scotty\\" Robertson Memorial Gymnasium, an alternate practice facility for the Bulldogs and Lady Techsters basketball teams, named for the eight-time Hall of Famer, Coach Scotty Robertson. Hathaway was an active member and president of the Shreveport Junior Chamber International, often called the Jaycees. He is a former Chamber of Commerce director. He has been affiliated with the American Legion and the Forty and Eight veterans organizations as well as Kiwanis International. He is a long-term member of the Noel Memorial United Methodist Church in Shreveport. After his term as sheriff, Hathaway began working in commercial real estate business, affiliated with Walker-Alley & Associates in Shreveport. He was also in the insurance business in Shreveport. Hathaway is married to the former Betty Lou Moore, formerly of Minden in Webster Parish. They have three children. Political life After working during the 1950s and early 1960s in insurance and investment banking, Hathaway joined the staff of the Caddo Parish Police Jury in 1962. He was named secretary-treasurer of the jury on May 10, 1967.Veta Samuels, History of Caddo Parish Police Jury - Caddo Parish Commission since 1840 The police jury, the traditional governing body of the parish, was renamed in 1984 as the Caddo Parish Commission. =Shreveport public works commissioner, 1970-1978= Hathaway stepped down as police jury secretary-treasurer in 1970 to contest the office of Shreveport public works commissioner under the then commission form of city government. He replaced an interim commissioner on the city council who had taken office on January 1, 1969, following the resignation of the 34-year incumbent, H. Lane Mitchell, who was caught up in a 1971 scandal involving four counts of theft in the office which he had already vacated. Hathaway was one of five citywide elected commissioners who acted in both executive and legislative roles in the governance of Shreveport municipal affairs for an eight-year period. He presided over the public works department as an executive and cast a single vote on the Shreveport City Council, when it in met in public session. His administration of the office coincided with that of Mayor Calhoun Allen, who was technically the \\"commissioner of administration\\". Hathaway's council colleagues included fellow Democrat Public Utilities Commissioner William \\"Bill\\" Collins, and after Collins resigned in 1977, Billy Guin, a Republican who served for the remaining year-and-a-half in that position, as well as Finance Commissioner George A. Burton, the first Republican to hold Shreveport municipal office since Reconstruction, and Public Safety Commissioner George W. D'Artois, who was forced from office in the summer of 1976 in another corruption scandal. D'Artois corruption case Under pressure from the business community, the city council unanimously announced in the spring of 1976 that it would investigate Commissioner D'Artois regarding a series of corruption cases in the public safety department. When public opinion swung against the council members for \\"investigating themselves\\", Mayor Allen called for the probe to be turned over to the office of Attorney General William J. Guste. Allen and D'Artois were previously allies on the council,\\"L. Calhoun Allen's Victory handshake with George W. D'Artois\\", The Shreveport Times, August 17, 1974 but Hathaway had often opposed them both. When Allen called for D'Artois to step down from office voluntarily while the state probe proceeded, Hathaway said that he thought that it made little difference whether D'Artois remained in office while the investigation was underway because he believed that Guste's staff would conduct a thorough, fair investigation. Guste's investigators soon indicated the probe would go beyond the public safety department, with at Mayor Allen and Utilities Commissioner Collins as well. D'Artois did not step down voluntarily but was forced to resign on August 6, 1976, when he was arrested for conspiracy to murder his former advertising specialist, Jim Leslie of Shreveport. He died of complications of heart surgery ten months later in June 1977 in San Antonio, Texas. Challenge to commission form of government The interest group, Blacks United for Lasting Leadership, Inc., an African- American civil rights organization in Shreveport, filed a class action lawsuit against the City of Shreveport to force an end to the commission form of government. In 1974, blacks constituted 32 percent of the Shreveport population, but no African American had served on the city council, which since 1910 had consisted of five commissioners, including the mayor. By the time of the 2010 U.S. Census forty years later, Shreveport was nearly 55 percent black in population.2010 General profile of housing and population characteristics for Shreveport from the U.S. Census BULL alleged that the inherent at-large feature of the commission government operated unconstitutionally to dilute the votes of blacks. The United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana agreed and declared the commission government unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision was affirmed in March 1978 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. Shreveport hence switched to the mayor-council form of government with the fast-approaching 1978 elections, when Commissioner Don Hathaway ran a strong but losing race for mayor to then automobile dealer, William T. \\"Bill\\" Hanna, who made issue that he was an \\"outsider\\" to the troubles that had befallen City Hall, now called Government Plaza, during the preceding term of office. Utilities Commissioner Billy Guin was another unsuccessful candidate for mayor in the September 16 nonpartisan blanket primary, also known as the jungle primary.The Shreveport Times, September 17, 1978Shreveport Journal, September 18, 1978 Days after his defeat for mayor, on November 21, 1978, Hathaway joined Mayor- elect Hanna, outgoing Mayor Allen, and outgoing Commissioner Guin for the dedication of a new Exhibition Hall on the riverfront, a structure later named in Allen's honor, now known as StageWorks of Louisiana. =Caddo Parish sheriff, 1980-2000= Duties as sheriff Hathaway soon rebounded politically upon his election on December 9, 1979 as the Caddo Parish sheriff and ex officio tax collector. The one-term incumbent, Harold Monroe Terry (1925-2016), did not seek reelection, and Hathaway defeated his fellow Democrat Jim Adger, an agri-businessman, in a runoff contest, 55.6 to 44.4 percent. The election corresponded with the narrow victory of Republican David C. Treen as governor.The Shreveport Times, December 10, 1974, p. 1 Hathaway was reelected thereafter with little opposition thereafter through his retirement in July 2000. In his last election in October 1995, Hathway polled nearly two thirds of the ballots cast against two opponents, a fellow Democrat, Jerry Henderson, and Donnie Ray O'Briant, a Republican. The sheriff in Caddo Parish frequently serves multiple terms; Hathaway's predecessor, Harold Monroe Terry (born September 1925), is the exception. Terry served only one term from 1976 to 1980, the shortest tenure of any Caddo Parish sheriff in the 20th century. Under Hathaway, the sheriff's department increased over two decades from 150 to 600 deputies; the budget, from $8 million to $32 million annually. He introduced programs to assist deputies enrolled in higher education programs. He altered recruiting and hiring to incorporate background checks and polygraphs. Homer C. Bryant, Jr. (1924-1999), a Shreveport native and Purple Heart recipient during World War II, was Hathaway's major in charge of criminal investigations; a polygraph examiner, he was particularly known for his expertise and dedication to law enforcement. Hathaway standardized compensation and introduced incentive pay. Hathaway brought all divisions of the office into three functional components: (1) Administration, (2) Detention, and (3) Operations. He computerized the tax division, record keeping, and collections departments. He doubled the number of deputies on patrol. He created or expanded already existing special teams for hazardous materials, special response, search and rescue, and helicopter monitoring. He established substations at strategic locations. In 1982, Caddo sheriff's deputies responded to a call of an abandoned 36-hour-old infant boy weighing seven pounds, wrapped only in a towel, and in excellent condition. He was found in a carport at a house on Red Oak Lane along with an attached note asking that good parents be found. The child was taken to LSU Medical Center pediatric services for transition to proper authorities. Hathaway said, \\"We probably have to assume the baby was not hospital-delivered, if only because hospitals [then] usually keep newborns longer than thirty-six hours. On the other hand, if the baby were home-delivered and without the help of a doctor, there would be no record of birth.\\" Chief deputy David Milton Almond (1937-2003) said that the abandonment was only the second such case that he had witnessed in his then seventeen years in law enforcement. In 1987, Hathaway announced that his deputies engaging in undercover drug purchases had obtained thirty warrants and made at least seventeen arrests. All suspects were booked with distributing such substances as amphetamines, marijuana, cocaine, and valium. One suspect was charged with the distribution of a false representation of a controlled dangerous substance. In 1983, Hathaway had introduced the canine corps for use in narcotics detection. In 1998, Caddo deputies with the help of drug-sniffing dogs uncovered two bags at the Greyhound bus station in Shreveport containing $310,000 and $20,000 in narcotics. A Pensacola man caught by random search with $4,000 in his possession confessed to owning the two unclaimed bags. Hathaway said the $314,000 was \\"by far the largest amount of money we've picked up in this type of investigation.\\" Sixty percent of the funds went to sheriff' department coffers. =Public relations= In 1983, Sheriff Hathaway was part of a contingent of six hundred supporters of Edwin Edwards who joined Edwards in a celebratory tour of France and Belgium. The tab of $10,000 per person was used to retire Edwards's 1983 campaign debt of $4.2 million.\\"Marion Edwards, brother of ex-Louisiana governor, dies at 84\\", Alexandria Town Talk, January 13, 2013 Edwards had just scored his third term as governor by unseating the Republican David C. Treen. On a train in Paris, Hathaway was presented a drawing on a menu of an oak tree by the Louisiana artist George Rodrigue before Rodrigue became famous with his blue dog symbol. In 2004, Rodrigue came to Shreveport with incoming Governor Kathleen Blanco and made an appearance at the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, where he autographed Hathaway's menu from more than twenty years earlier. In 1984, in a celebration of Freddie Spencer's victory the previous year in the 500cc Grand Prix World Championship in motorcycle racing, Hathaway made Spencer an \\"honorary deputy\\" as the Shreveort native returned home for \\"Freddie Spencer Day\\", declared by Mayor John Brennan Hussey. Housing inmates As sheriff, Hathaway found himself frequently at odds with his two former employers as police jury treasurer and as public works commissioner, the Caddo Parish Commission and the City of Shreveport, in regard to the financial cost of housing inmates at the Caddo Correctional Institute, a penal farm at Spring Ridge near Keithville in southern Caddo Parish known for a high rate of unrest and inmate escape. On May 17, 1992, deputy Darren Wayne Hill claimed serious brain injuries sustained during a riot at CCI. Hill hence filed suit against Hathaway on the grounds that the sheriff was negligent in maintaining order at the facility. However, Hill never won a judgment through the Louisiana Circuit Court of Appeal for the Second District in Shreveport because of procedural errors in his claim. Hill had sought financial relief through the Sheriff's Pension and Relief Fund as well as damages. Originally, Sheriff Hathaway was responsible only for the jail within the courthouse in Shreveport. On April 6, 1982, however, the sheriff's department assumed full control of the penal farm from the former police jury, the predecessor of the Caddo Parish Commission. Hathaway renamed the facility the Caddo Detention Center. In time, Hathaway was overrun with the increasing number of inmates and the associated rising costs to shelter them. Hathaway said that CDC could not adequately accommodate some 375 inmates, more than two thirds of whom were blacks, with some \\"murderers and rapists\\". Hathaway also said the community needed adequate psychiatric services because numerous inmates were mental cases in need of medical treatment. Early in 1982, a 17-year-old bank robbery suspect, Jerry Anderson, leaped eight stories to his death while in custody at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport. Questions arose as to whether the youth was depressed or having a seizure. The sheriff's department investigation determined that young Anderson was suicidal. The suspect was in leg chains and under guard by a private security firm, rather than a sheriff's deputy. Hathaway said the department had too few deputies to guard individual prisoners and had to hire outside assistance in such cases. On November 23, 1988, two inmates attacked the 26-year-old deputy, known only as \\"Mick\\", who was on guard at CDC in the section called \\"West Max\\" after he led a group of prisoners outside for their exercise routine. The men were taken to an area called the \\"bullpen\\", which was reinforced with razor wire to lessen the success of escape attempts. Under a dead-lock head-lock, the deputy barely escaped with his life, but security personnel came to his defense in time. The attack was touched off when the deputy told an inmate that he could not wear a blue bandana on his head, a symbol of gangs. The incident was one of numerous reported cases of violence in the CDC. Mick reported that his family safety was in jeopardy for a time because one of the inmates seized his paycheck which happened to be in his pocket. The check revealed the deputy's family address. In a court case, the State of Louisiana ruled that the Caddo Parish Commission was primarily responsible for the maintenance cost of the CDC prisoners, rather than the City of Shreveport or the sheriff's department. In 1995, the detention center ceased housing parish prisoners after the opening on Forum Drive in north Shreveport of a new 1,070-bed facility called Caddo Correctional Center, a structure that Hathaway had urged since he became sheriff. Still operational, this jail is designed to manage a large number of inmates with relatively few personnel. CCC is the largest facility of its kind in the tri-state area of Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. In 1999, Hathaway was sued by a CCC inmate, Charles Barr, who alleged that he slipped and fell on the wet floor of his cell, which caused a personal injury that required major medical treatment. Barr's \\"inmate grievance\\" was dismissed on the grounds that his injury was a result of diabetes. Hathaway prevailed in the ruling from the Second District Appeals Court by showing that the in-house grievance procedure is not subject to judicial review and that Barr did not seek redress through tort action as required in such circumstances. Leadership roles In 1990, Hathaway brought to Shreveport the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, first established by Daryl Gates, the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from 1978 to 1992. Hathaway started a \\"Senior Citizen Academy\\" in which older residents, many foster grandparents, completed a 14-hour curriculum that gave them an overview of the operations of the sheriff's office as well as practical safety tips. From 1994 to 1996, Hathaway was president of the Northwest Law Enforcement Planning Agency. In 2000, shortly after he left the sheriff's office, the Northwest agency honored Hathaway for his twenty years of leadership in the department. The award was presented by neighboring Bossier Parish Sheriff Larry Deen. From 1996 to 1997, Hathaway was the president of the National Sheriffs' Association, one of only six sheriffs in Louisiana since the creation of the organization in 1938 to have held that position, as of 2014. Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act In 1995, questions arose when the Caddo Sheriff's department under Hathaway denied a gun permit to a Shreveport liquor store clerk, Philip Russell Coleman. When Coleman was informed of the sheriff's department decision, he told the pawn shop owner where he intended to buy a weapon that he would go to see the deputies in an attempt to resolve the matter, which Coleman assumed was a \\"mistake\\". Before Coleman could get his weapon permit, however, he was shot to death in a holdup. Hathaway said that there was apparently justification for initially denying Coleman's application but that when Coleman came to the office, his application was approved. National radio commentator Paul Harvey aired the Coleman story on one of his broadcasts. Many used the Coleman case to show the unintended consequences of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, which requires a waiting period for background checks for citizens seeking to purchase handguns.

Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez was a writer who worked in many literary genres, producing literary journalism or cr√≥nicas [es], novels, essays, and screenplays for documentaries. His writing was recognized with several awards in Mexico and Spain. Life Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez was born in Mexico City in 1950. His mother died while he was in the third grade and his father abandoned his family, forming another family.Field of Battle, p. 14. Biographical information given in introduction by Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez' friend David Lida. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez studied modern literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico from 1978 to 1982. Apart from his writing career he was a rock musician, playing bass with some of his brothers in a band named Enigma. Following the publication of Huesos en el desierto, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez was kidnapped via taxi and beaten by assailants who warned him that his work was being \\"closely monitored\\"; he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and survived the attack, continuing his journalistic work.Field of Battle, p. 11. Introduction by Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez' friend David Lida. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez died in hospital on 3 April 2017 from a heart attack. Career Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez made his career as a critic, narrator, essayist, literary historian and scriptwriter. After graduating, he worked at the Historical Studies Department of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia from 1985 to 1988. From 1990 to 1992, he was an assistant of the Exhibition Coordination of CONACULTA, working on a multimedia production called \\"Asamblea de ciudades, la Ciudad de M√©xico 1920‚Äì1950\\". His work in journalism includes editing at the Estudio de Salvador Novo A.C. and at the Biblioteca de M√©xico magazine from 1993 to 2000, as well as serving as editor and photographer at the Luna C√≥rnea magazine from 1992 to 2002. When the Reforma newspaper was founded in 1993, he joined as editor and columnist for both the regular paper and its cultural supplement, called El √Ångel. He has also worked for La Jornada. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez was best known for his investigative work about the femicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez in the 1990s and 2000s. He began as an investigative reporter, making his first trip to the area in 1995 for Reforma. His series of articles served as the basis for the book Huesos en el desierto (Bones in the Desert), published in 2002, which mixes reporting, essay and reflective writing. This work was a finalist at the Lettre Ulysses International Prize of Literary Reporting in Germany and was translated into Italian and French. It influenced other writing on the topic, including a direct collaboration with writer Roberto Bola√±o, who was writing the novel 2666 in the early 2000s as well. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez blamed the murders of the women on machismo and misogyny in Mexico. This examination of violence led to two other books that form a trilogy on modern violence, El hombre sin cabeza (The Headless Man) and Campo de guerra (Field of Battle) which examine drug- related violence and the role of international politics, respectively. As a screenwriter, he wrote for the television series M√©xico, Siglo XX, and a documentary called Nacional Dominical which he also directed with Roberto Diego Ortega. In 1993 his script for the documentary Los bajos fondos, produced by UNAM, won first prize at the third Festival y Muestra Nacional de Televisi√≥n y Video at the Instituciones de Ense√±anza Superior en M√©xico. He worked as a professor at the Doctor Jos√© Mar√≠a Luis Mora Research Center. Works Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez wrote or co-wrote over twenty books, also contributing to the Anales de Literature Hispanoamericana of Universidad Complutense, Biblioteca de M√©xico, El Nacional Dominical, √çnsula (Spain), a supplement of the Siempre! magazine called La Cultura en M√©xico, La Jornada Semanal, Letras Libres, Nexos, and the Revista Universidad de M√©xico. His novels included El tri√°ngulo imperfecto (2003), El plan Schreber (2004), La pandilla c√≥smica (2005) and El vuelo (2008). In 2014, he published a novel called El artista adolescente que confund√≠a el mundo con un c√≥mic, which integrated elements of graphic novels and comics into both the literary style and the storyline. Other titles included the essays Los bajos fondos, el antro, la bohemia y el caf√© (1988), El Centauro en el paisaje (1992), De sangre y de sol (2006) and El hombre sin cabeza. He also edited Viajes y ensayos by Salvador Novo (1997). Cr√≥nicas Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez wrote three closely related works of non-fiction which examine crime, corruption and the Drug War in Mexico: The Femicide Machine, The Iguala 43 (Los 43 de Iguala) and Field of Battle (Campo de guerra). The latter two books were originally published in Spanish by Anagrama, and all three books were translated into English and published as entries in the Semiotext(e) Intervention Series. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez wrote The Femicide Machine specifically for the Intervention Series; although it is a distinct text from the longer Huesos en el desierto, both books examine the female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez. The three works are examples of cr√≥nicas [es], the Spanish word for a genre of literary journalism which blends straight reporting and editorializing. =The Femicide Machine= In The Femicide Machine, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez examines a series of circumstances which he argues have conspired to produce Ciudad Ju√°rez' female homicide victims. Although violence associated with Mexico's illegal drug trade is one factor, he also considers the city's proximity to the U.S. border, its cultural and geographic separation from the rest of Mexico, historical prevalence of technology in the city (particularly cars and cell phones)The Femicide Machine, pp. 19-20. and the impact of NAFTA which incentivized the growth of maquiladoras along the border. These factories provided employment opportunities for women; according to Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez, this provoked a misogynistic resentment in Mexico's culture of machismo. In Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez' account, the confluence of these factors gave rise to a process which resulted in Ciudad Ju√°rez' high rate of female murder victims; the process itself can be likened to a machine. The text concludes with an account of the 2001 kidnapping and murder of Lilia Alejandra Garc√≠a Andrade, a factory worker and resident of Ciudad Ju√°rez; following the murder, her mother Norma Andrade began activism against female homicide in Ciudad Ju√°rez, and was herself attacked.The Femicide Machine, p. 127. =The Iguala 43= The Iguala 43 examines the kidnapping of 43 male students in Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico, which ended with their presumptive murders. As in The Femicide Machine, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez considers a series of historical circumstances which informed the tragedy‚Äîthis time affecting male victims in Mexico's south, as opposed to female victims in its north. On 26 September 2014, a group of male students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College commandeered two local buses which they drove to nearby Iguala, where they took another three. Their plan was to travel to Mexico City to participate in protests commemorating the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre, after which they would return the buses.The Iguala 43, p. 17. In one account of following events, local police attacked the students, killing some, and then apprehended the survivors, turning them over to the Guerreros Unidos, a local criminal drug trafficking organization. The Guerreros Unidos then killed the surviving students and burned their bodies, disposing of the remains.The Iguala 43, p. 18. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez explains the historical circumstances which led to the atrocity. Located in Mexico's south, the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' college has a far-left political tradition, producing alumni such as Lucio Caba√±as and Genaro V√°zquez RojasThe Iguala 43 pp. 31-33. who subsequently became guerrillas opposed to the Mexican state; a historical antagonism between Mexican authorities and Ayotzinapa personnel was formed. Further, there was an existing tradition of the forced disappearance and killing of activists; Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez cites the case of Rosendo Radilla, an activist who was stopped at a military checkpoint in 1974 and never seen again.The Iguala 43, p. 54. Taken together with the overall societal corruption and increased violence during the Mexican Drug War, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez assigns blame for the massacre jointly to the governments of Mexico and the United States, on account of internal corruption and ongoing CIA operations within Mexico, respectively.The Iguala 43, pp. 106-112. =Field of Battle= Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez uses the metaphor of anamorphosis to describe the altered reality experienced by victims of violent crime, citing the distorted skull in Hans Holbein the Younger's The Ambassadors.Field of Battle, pp. 99-100. In Field of Battle, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez examines the contemporary militarization of Mexican society in response to drug-related violence. The central argument of the book is that the de facto absence of the rule of law is the root cause for ongoing violent crime and suffering within Mexico. This absence of the rule of law is generated by corruption which begins by eroding the legitimacy of the rule of law itself, and which ends by creating an \\"a-legal\\" worldField of Battle, pp. 31-33. in which the distinction between legality and illegality becomes meaningless because crimes are rarely punished and law enforcement themselves often do not enforce or respect the law. Given these circumstances, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez uses the visual phenomenon of anamorphosis as a metaphor to describe the subjectively distorted reality experienced by victims of violent crime in Mexico who are often caught between police corruption, an inefficient legal system, and the violence of gangs or drug cartels. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez concludes the text by advocating nonviolence and respect for the rule of law as antidotes both to drug violence and also to the militarization of Mexican society because unlike the latter, the former represent peaceful means which are consistent with their peaceful end. Most of the passages from The Femicide Machine's third chapter War City/Mexico-USA are recycled throughout Field of Battle. In particular, the fourth chapter of Field of Battle, Global War on Drug Trafficking, rephrases and slightly permutes the latter two-thirds of War City/Mexico-USA. In both cases the material covers the geopolitical interests of the United States via CIA operations within Mexico and Latin America, and the expansion of Mexican drug trafficking to Europe via West Africa. Recognition In 1993, Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez was a finalist at the Anagrama Essay Prize in Barcelona, Spain, with the work El centauro en el paisaje. This was followed in 1995 by the Fernando Ben√≠tez National Journalism Prize in Mexico for Mujer de table-dance. The work Huesos en el desierto was a finalist at the Lettre Ulysses International Prize of Literary Reporting in Germany and received the Herralde Novel Prize in 2004. El tri√°ngulo imperfecto (2003) was a finalist of the Antonin Artaud Prize for novels in Mexico. In 2013, he won the Premio Casa Am√©rica Catalunya a la Libertad de Expresi√≥n en Iberoam√©rica, followed by the Anagrama Essay Prize for Campo de guerra in 2014. Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez' work was supported by grants from FONCA (1990‚Äì1991), two from the Rockefeller Foundation and from the history department of the Universidad Iberoamericana (1990‚Äì1999) . He was a member of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte of Mexico since 1996.

Although some hardcore punk bands had already made references to Krishna Consciousness in the 1980s, the subgenre was established in the early 1990s by the bands Shelter and 108. The name is a portmanteau of \\"Krishna\\" and \\"hardcore\\". Academic Colin Helb described krishnacore as \\"a subculture of a subculture of a subculture.\\" The subgenre has been met with surprise by some observers due to the reputed contradictions between punk rock and Krishna Consciousness.  Precedents (1980s)  John Joseph of the Cro- Mags in 2015 Punk rock and Hinduism have converged occasionally since the early days of the genre. Singer Poly Styrene of the English band X-Ray Spex joined ISKON following the breakup of her band in 1980. On the New York hardcore punk scene, the main influence on some musicians to embrace ISKON was the Washington D.C.'s hardcore band Bad Brains which, despite being Rastas, \\"grafted fervent spirituality onto an otherwise nihilistic and antitranscendental genre.\\" One of the first members of its scene to adopt Krishna Consciousness was John Joseph of the Cro-Mags. New York bands Antidote and Cause for Alarm were among the first that began to explore Krishna Consciousness in both their creative and personal lives, but the most prominent example was the Cro-Mags' debut album The Age of Quarrel (1986), whose title is a translation for the Hindu concept of Kali Yuga that is taught in Hare Krishna philosophy. Music journalist Eric Caruncho has noted that the Filipino band The Wuds performed Krishna-influenced punk as early as 1986.  Establishment  The band Shelter was formed in 1991, which is credited as the inventor of krishnacore. Shelter consisted of two ex-members of Youth of Today, vocalist Ray Cappo and guitarist John Porcelly, who had become Krishna devotees. The genre is also strongly associated with Equal Vision Records, which was formed by Shelter members to promote the Krishna movement. Other early acts within the genre include 108, Refuse to Fall and Prema.  Characteristics  Although the Hare Krishna movement and many straight edgers shared the principles of refraining from drug use, vegetarianism and condemnation of illicit sex, the former also provided a transcendental and philosophical framework wherein lay these commitments. Academic Mike Dines states that krishnacore bands were \\"conscious of its own history and aesthetic.\\" He highlights \\"the importance of the devotional doctrine of bhakti-yoga within this relationship; a doctrine that was to inform further the move from straightedge punk to Hare Krishna monk.‚Äô Dines therefore brings together rasa and the idea of Nada-Brahma to highlight the ‚Äòunique fusion of Western popular music and the Eastern-based Indian spirituality (and lifestyle) of the Vaishnavas.‚Äô In turning the punk aesthetic towards the devotional and, in particular, the transcendental vibration of the holy name, Krishnacore became a site of expression for bhakti-yoga. Moreover, Dines states that ‚Äòwhat provides validity to the connecting of Krishnacore and Indian aesthetics lies in the placement of those band members and associates who were involved in the scene.‚Äô He concludes, ‚ÄòRay Cappo, Robert Fish and Vic Dicara were not mere spectators of the Hare Krishna movement, but were indeed devotees themselves, reading and studying scripture, attending lectures and practicing the lifestyle of the devotee.‚Äô The difference between krishnacore and bands such as Cro-Mags or Cause for Alarm, which previously made some connections between the Hare Krishna movement and the hardcore scene, was that the service to Krishna had become the sole objective of krishnacore.

Life and work  He was the only child of a wealthy businessman who dealt in furnishings and related items. As a child, he led a sheltered life due to a severe case of stuttering that would often leave him speechless. He was sent to a private preparatory school and later attended the Gymnasium but, because of his impediment, did poorly. In 1908, he decided not to continue his formal education, taking courses in stenography, typing and bookkeeping with the intention of following his father into business. He also underwent speech therapy, but to no avail. Finally, he and his father agreed that a business career was unsuitable and he began to pursue his interest in painting. , a landscape painter and the son of one of his father's business acquaintances, gave him his first lessons, after which he attended the Bremen School of Applied Arts. Then, following Bertelsmann's recommendation, he went to the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School where he became a Master Student of Fritz Mackensen. Every summer while he was a student (from 1910 to 1914), he would join Bertelsmann at the Fischerhude art colony in Worpswede, prolifically painting everything of interest in the local surroundings. It was there that he came under the influence of the Barbizon school and Van Gogh. In 1914, he developed the symptoms of lead poisoning. Apparently, he had been in the habit of sharpening his brushes between his lips and absorbed lead from the white pigments. He died shortly after undergoing stomach surgery at St. Joseph's Hospital in Bremen.Volkert H. U. Koch: August Haake 1889‚Äì1915. With an introduction by Thomas Deecke, contributions by Birgit Nachtwey and Wolf- Dietmar Stock. Kunstverein Fischerhude in Buthmanns Hof e.V.. Verlag Atelier im Bauernhaus, Fischerhude 2006. After his death, a young music student named Hipo D√∂hrman presented herself to his parents as his fianc√©e and was informally adopted into the family. His paintings were kept by friends and family and were largely inaccessible to the public until 1967. Most are still in private ownership. As he usually didn't sign his paintings, attribution of his works is sometimes based solely on their original ownership or his habit of drilling two holes in his canvases, to dry them by hanging them on his back with a string while riding home on his motorcycle.

The RSF grew out of, and is primarily composed of, the Janjaweed militias which fought on behalf of the Sudanese government during the War in Darfur, killing and raping civilians and burning their houses.Emad Hassan, Militiamen in Sudan raped men and women, says eyewitness, Deutsche Welle (September 6, 2019).Jason Burke & Zeinab Mohammed Salih, Millions join general strike in Sudan aimed at dislodging army, The Guardian (June 9, 2019). The RSF's actions in Darfur qualify as crimes against humanity according to Human Rights Watch. The RSF are administered by the National Intelligence and Security Service, although during military operations they are commanded by the Sudanese Armed Forces.\\"RSF to Uproot Rebels\\". Sudan Vision Daily, 19 May 2014. , the commander of the RSF is General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\"). During the Sudanese political crisis of 2019, the military junta who took control of the country employed the RSF to violently crack down on pro- democracy demonstrators. Along with other security forces, the RSF carried out the Khartoum massacre on 3 June 2019. Origin The RSF has its roots in the Janjaweed militias used by the Sudanese Government in its attempts to fight the anti-government insurgency during the War in Darfur. The RSF was officially formed in August 2013 under the command of the NISS, following a restructuring and reactivation of Janjaweed militias in order to combat rebel groups in Darfur region, South Kordofan, and the Blue Nile states, following joint attacks by Sudanese Revolutionary Front rebels in North and South Kordofan in April 2013.\\"Sudan‚Äôs RSF pledges to liberate rebel stronghold in South Kordofan\\". Sudan Tribune, 11 June 2014. Leadership and numbers The RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\"), who has been its leader since it was created in 2013 or 2014. , Hemetti's brother Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo is deputy head of the RSF. The RSF was estimated by Human Rights Watch as having about ‚Äì soldiers in February 2014 in Darfur. In 2016‚Äì2017, the RSF had members participating in the Yemeni Civil War. In late October 2019, had returned to Sudan. In July 2019, about 1000 RSF soldiers were present in Libya, supporting the Libyan National Army commanded by Khalifa Haftar. Role =Migration control= In addition to its role in Darfur, the RSF is also deployed to patrol the border with Libya and round up Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees in response to the Khartoum process, which is an initiative between European and African states, including Sudan, to stem the flow of migrants to Europe. =Business interests= In November 2017, Hemetti used the RSF to take over control of gold mines in the Darfur region, which led to him becoming one of the richest people in Sudan by 2019. Hemetti's brother Abdul Rahim, deputy head of the RSF, heads the Al Junaid (or Al Gunade) corporation involved in gold mining and trading in Sudan. In December 2019, a Global Witness investigation into the RSF and Al Junaid argued that the RSF and Al Junaid are closely linked in terms of financial transactions. Global Witness stated that \\"the RSF and [Al Junaid had] captured a swathe of the [Sudanese] gold industry and [were] likely using it to fund their operations.\\" The General Manager of Al Junaid stated to Thomson Reuters that there were no close links between the two. The RSF has two front companies called GSK, a small Sudanese technology company, and Tradive General Trading LLC, a United Arab Emirates-based company, both controlled by Hemetti's brother Algoney Hamdan Dagalo. War in Darfur During the War in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015, RSF \\"repeatedly attacked villages, burned and looted homes, beating, raping and executing villagers,\\" aided by air and ground support from the Sudanese Armed Forces. The RSF executions and rapes typically took place in villages after rebels had left. The attacks were systematic enough to qualify as crimes against humanity according to Human Rights Watch. International civil wars =Libyan Civil War= During the 2019 Western Libya offensive phase of the Second Libyan Civil War, in July 2019, about 1000 RSF soldiers were present in Libya, supporting the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Khalifa Haftar and based in Tobruk, which was fighting against the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli. =Yemeni Civil War= The RSF has participated in the Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent), supporting the pro-Hadi forces. Both the RSF and other Sudanese security forces, participating in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, have killed civilians and destroyed infrastructure, for which they are suspected of war crimes by Human Rights Watch. In 2016‚Äì2017, the RSF had members participating in the Yemeni Civil War. In late October 2019, had returned to Sudan. 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese protests and human rights abuses The RSF killed 100 protestors, injured 500, raped women and pillaged homes in the Khartoum massacre on 3 June 2019 during the 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese protests. During the first day of Eid al-Fitr in Sudan, in early June 2019, there were several reports that the RSF tied bricks of cement to the bodies of dead protestors to make them sink to the bottom of the Nile and never be found. The Central Committee of Medical Doctors stated that more than 100 people had been killed. On 6 June 2019, Kumi Naidoo, the head of Amnesty International, called for the \\"[immediate withdrawal of] all members of the Rapid Support Forces from policing and law enforcement anywhere in Sudan and especially in Khartoum\\". In addition to the killings in Khartoum, other human rights violations during the 2018-19 crisis have been attributed to the RSF, including the rape of 70 male and female protesters during the Khartoum massacre and the following days; the targeting of peaceful sit-ins;Sudanese Rapid Support Forces Are Targeting Hospitals, Peaceful Sit-In; Dozens of Civilians Reported Killed, Physicians for Human Rights (June 3, 2019). and attacks on several hospitals. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors reported Janjaweed/RSF shooting dead nine people in the market of the village al-Dalij (or al-Delig) in Central Darfur on 10 or 11/12 June 2019. The massacre and the burning down of the market were interpreted by locals as a response to civil disobedience.

He primarily plays at fly-half, but has also played as a centre. O'Leary currently plays for Pro D2 side Rouen, having previously played for Nottingham, Ealing Trailfinders, Irish provincial side Connacht and Grenoble in France. O'Leary qualifies as Canadian through his mother and first represented Canada when he played for their under-20 team at the 2013 Junior World Trophy. He began playing for the senior team in 2017 after being called up for trials ahead of the mid-year internationals. Early life Born in Cork, O'Leary grew up in Tipperary. He received his secondary education at the community college in Killaloe. In his youth he played for the Scariff rugby team and made the Munster under-18 clubs side while a member there and later moved to Young Munster. While at Young Munster, O'Leary was part of the Munster Rugby under-age set up. Shane's father Declan is coaching services manager with Coaching Ireland, working with a wide variety of sports.http://www.irishsportscouncil.ie/About_Us/Who_We_Are/Staff_Members/ Club career =Grenoble= Ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season O'Leary moved to French side Grenoble in the Top 14, joining the team's academy. O'Leary had previously worked with Grenoble skills coach Mike Prendergast, who gave him his debut at Young Munster. Like O'Leary, Predergast was in his first season at the French club. O'Leary had also been assisted by Rugby Canada in his move to France, as the union had helped him to distribute information on himself and his availability to clubs around Europe in an attempt to break into professional rugby. Prendergast and O'Leary made up part a significant Irish contingent for the team, along with scrum-half James Hart, forwards coach Bernard Jackman and the captain Andrew Farley, an Australian-born former Ireland A player. O'Leary impressed in the academy and was handed a debut for the senior side in the 2013‚Äì14 European Challenge Cup, coming on as a replacement against Bayonne on 10 October 2013. O'Leary made four further appearances, playing in the home and away games with London Wasps and Viadana. He was a replacement in all but one of these appearances, starting away to Wasps. =Connacht= It was announced in May 2014 that O'Leary would be returning to Ireland for the 2014‚Äì15 season. He signed for the provincial side Connacht, joining on a one-year deal. In his first season with the team O'Leary made four appearances in the Pro12, scoring two tries. He didn't feature in the 2014‚Äì15 Challenge Cup but featured in the team's play-off to qualify for the following season's Champions Cup. All of O'Leary's appearances for the senior team in his first year came from the bench. In August 2015, he agreed another one-year deal with Connacht. In his second season, O'Leary played in three of Connacht's Challenge Cup games. He was used as a replacement against Newcastle Falcons in Galway, before starting the away fixture. O'Leary also started in the side's quarter-final meeting with his former club Grenoble. O'Leary continued to be used sparingly throughout the 2015‚Äì16 Pro12 campaign, but injuries to Jack Carty, AJ MacGinty and Craig Ronaldson led to him making more appearances later in the season. He made two starts and three substitute appearances in total during the course of the regular season as Connacht qualified for the league's play-offs. O'Leary was an unused substitute in the semi-final against Glasgow Warriors, but came on in the Grand Final against Leinster to help close out the game as Connacht claimed their first ever league title. He signed another contract extension in June 2016 to take him up to summer of 2017 with the province. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, O'Leary appeared as a substitute in Connacht's opening five Pro12 games, and in the opening two rounds of the Champions Cup. He didn't in the Pro12 clash with Leinster, but returned for the following round against Newport Gwent Dragons. That month however, O'Leary suffered a concussion injury in training. This injury ruled O'Leary out for some time and he failed to make an appearance for the first team for the remainder of the season. In April 2017, it was announced that O'Leary would depart Connacht at the end of the season. =Atlantic Rock= In May 2017, O'Leary traveled to Canada to take part in trials for the national team. While there, he joined Canadian Rugby Championship side Atlantic Rock. O'Leary played in a single game for the St. John's-based side. =Ealing Trailfinders= In September 2017, it was announced that O'Leary had signed for Ealing Trailfinders in the English Championship. Signing for Ealing also meant linking up with Canadian international teammate Djustice Sears-Duru. =Nottingham= On 29 March 2018, O'Leary will leave Ealing Trailfinders to sign for English Championship rivals Nottingham ahead of the 2018-19 season. =Rouen= On 18 April 2020, O'Leary signs for French side Rouen in the Pro D2 ahead of the 2020‚Äì21 season. International career Qualified to play for Canada through his mother who was born in New Brunswick, O'Leary contacted Mike Shelley of Rugby Canada to inform the union of his eligibility after he was overlooked for the Ireland under-20 team. O'Leary was chosen in the Canadian under-20 squad for the 2013 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy. The faith in him was rewarded when he scored 45 points, finishing as the tournament's top scorer as Canada made it to the final, where they were beaten by the Italian under-20s. In 2017 after departing Connacht, O'Leary was called up to trials for the Canadian senior team ahead of the team's June internationals.

As the consumer protection agency for the State of Colorado, DORA's nine Divisions and more than 40 boards, commissions, and advisory committees license and regulate more than 700,000 people and 24,000 businesses in the state. DORA serves as a resource for objective information about licensed Colorado industries, professions and occupations, takes consumer complaints and works to educate consumers about their rights.  Structure  DORA is composed of these divisions: * Executive Director's Office * Office of Policy, Research & Regulatory Reform * Division of Banking * Division of Civil Rights * Division of Financial Services * Division of Insurance * Division of Professions and Occupations * Division of Real Estate * Division of Securities * Office of Consumer Counsel * Public Utilities Commission  History  The Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies was created in 1968, although several of the Department's divisions have been protecting Colorado citizens previously: * In 1877, state regulation of Colorado banks began one year after statehood was achieved, when the Colorado Legislature first codified the process by which banking associations could be chartered and operated. * In 1883, Colorado began to regulate insurance through the State Auditor's Office. In 1913, the Colorado Department of Insurance, now known as the Division of Insurance, was formed in response to widespread growth in the industry. * In 1913, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission was created when the State Legislature created it as part of the passage of the Public Utilities Act of 1913. * In 1923, regulation of the offer and sale of securities to investors began through the Division of Securities. * The real estate industry has been regulated since 1925 through what is now the Division of Real Estate. * In 1931, Colorado began chartering credit unions, when the General Assembly passed the Credit Union Act. Regulation of credit unions, savings and loan institutions and trust companies is conducted by what is now known as the Division of Financial Services. * In 1951, Colorado became the third state to establish a civil rights agency, now known as the Colorado Civil Rights Division. * In 1968, the Department of Regulatory Agencies was created pursuant to the \\"Administrative Organization Act of 1968\\". The act moved the aforementioned agencies into one umbrella department. The act also created the Division of Registrations (now known as the Division of Professions and Occupations) and moved many existing boards under its purview, some of which had been in existence for over a century. * In 1976, Colorado passed the first Sunset Law in the United States. This law requires the periodic review of various agencies throughout state government. In 1985, the Colorado General Assembly passed the Sunrise law as a complement to the Sunset law. This law requires that a review be conducted on all proposals to regulate previously unregulated occupations or professions. The Office of Policy, Research and Regulatory Reform, an office within the Executive Director's Office of the Department of Regulatory Agencies, conducts these reviews. * The Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) was created by the General Assembly as a division of the Attorney General's Office on July 1, 1984. OCC is now located within DORA. Its mission is the representation of residential, small business and agricultural utility consumers on certain utility issues before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.  Program Areas  ;Investigations Criminal and compliance investigations, both in response to formal complaints and as part of regular audits. Divisions: Civil Rights, Insurance, Professions and Occupations, Public Utilities Commission, Real Estate, Securities. ;Enforcement Resolution of complaints/charges received and proactive enforcement/compliance oriented investigations ensuring adequate consumer protection. Divisions: Civil Rights, Insurance, Professions and Occupations, Public Utilities Commission, Real Estate, Securities. ;Consumer Representation During Utility Rate Approvals Present evidence in support of consumers when utilities request rate increases.

The private Bruce is more introspective guy who really only deals with Alfred, and Alfred at the beginning of the series is really the only person who sees that side of Bruce Wayne. He's quiet; he's a little bit obsessive about particular things.\\" Developers expressed that the series would be a departure from previous Batman animated series in their choice to focus on the character's nature as a detective and focusing on his intellect. Crime fighting in the series would put emphasis on procedural aspects of mystery solving. Batman would also be more subject to external threats of injury. \\"He gets hurt. There are several episodes where he really gets damaged\\", emphasized Mitch Watson. * Alfred Pennyworth (voiced by JB Blanc) ‚Äì Alfred Pennyworth is a former MI6 agent and Bruce Wayne's butler. Following initial promotion of the series, critics were concerned with what they interpreted to be the re-characterization of Alfred Pennyworth as a fellow crime fighter. Producer Glen Murakami explained that initial promotion posters that had been issued to the press were not originally intended for release, and that they did not give an accurate display of Alfred's role in the show. However, Murakami referred to Alfred's canonical backstory, which cast Alfred as a former MI6 agent, and said that this would be Alfred's portrayal in the show. \\"I think people are really going to like him\\", series writer Mitch Watson said. \\"He's Sean Connery from The Untouchables. The characterization of Alfred would be that of a man who was once in a physical condition on par with Batman, who was now in his 60s and past his prime, but still able to provide advice to Batman and be an ally when necessary. This characterization was pitched to DC comics, who responded that the company was coincidentally also taking Alfred in that direction. Series developers originally intended to give Alfred a greater role in the series, but Murakami advised that they scale back his activities, over concern that he could outshine Batman. * Tatsu Yamashiro / Katana (voiced by Sumalee Montano) ‚Äì A martial arts swordmaster in hiding from the League of Assassins who was hired to act as Bruce Wayne's bodyguard by her godfather Alfred Pennyworth. She revealed to Alfred that she was undercover in the League of Assassins to steal the Soultaker Sword from them before it can be used for their own evils. * Commissioner Jim Gordon (voiced by Kurtwood Smith) ‚Äì A police lieutenant who works at the Gotham City Police Department. Although he disapproved of Batman's crime-fighting, he slowly became an ally of Batman. He is later promoted to police commissioner during the second half of the first season after Commissioner Correa was killed by two League of Assassins ninjas. Villains When the series was first unveiled, it was announced that lesser known villains would be introduced. Sam Register explained \\"We went in deeper into the villain library and pulled out some other villains\\" and the studio did not want the series to do another \\"Joker story\\".http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bewarebatman/backstage/vecchio/ The following villains are listed in order of appearance: * Lazlo Valentin / Professor Pyg (voiced by Brian George) ‚Äì Originally depicted as a psychologically deranged and violent member of a criminal organization called the Circus of Strange from Grant Morrison's Batman and Robin comics, Professor Pyg's character is drastically changed and is depicted as an eco-terrorist, thematically inspired by The Wind in the Willows. Acknowledging the violent nature of Professor Pyg and his partner Mister Toad, the creators toned down their depiction to make them less violent than their comic book counterparts. Some of Professor Pyg's eco-terrorism ranges from targeting businesspeople who did shady deals involving land developing on a swamp, capturing models and fashion designers that use parts of different animals (like bird feathers and animal pelts), and creating mutated animals. :*Mister Toad (voiced by Udo Kier) ‚Äì Professor Pyg's henchman whose depiction was also toned down.

In the closing credits of \\"Tests\\", the creation credits for Anarky and Katana were swapped, thus erroneously crediting Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo for creating him. * Tucker Long / Junkyard Dog (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) ‚Äì Junkyard, along with his friend and fellow artist Doodlebug, were detained by Batman but were freed by Anarky and recruited by him to sow chaos and destruction.

As the museum describes in its mission statement, it recognizes other people, events, and actions which furthered America's Right to Vote since \\"the Founding Fathers first planted the seeds of democracy in 1776.\\" The museum was founded by Faya Ora Rose Tour√© and Marie Foster. It is located near the Edmund Pettus Bridge. On this bridge on March 7, 1965, voting rights marchers who left the city for a planned walk to Montgomery were beaten and clubbed by Dallas County posse and Alabama State Troopers, in what became known as \\"Bloody Sunday.\\" They had passed into the county on a planned walk of 54 miles to Montgomery, Alabama's state capital. This treatment was nationally televised and covered by major media, arousing national outrage. After gaining federal protection from President Lyndon B. Johnson and a federal court order protecting their right to march, thousands of people left Selma on March 21, reaching Montgomery several days later. By then, they had been joined by thousands more, black and white, and 25,000 marchers entered the state capital to press for protection of constitutional voting rights. Later that summer the Voting Rights Act of 1965, introduced by the Johnson administration, was passed by Congress and signed by the president. Exhibits The museum's several rooms and exhibit areas include the \\"Footprints to Freedom\\" room, which features molded cast- footprints of some of the activists who participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches; a \\"Women's Suffrage Room,\\" honoring the contributions of African-American and other women who secured women's voting rights in the U.S.; the \\"Selma Room,\\" also known as the \\"Marie Foster\\" room, where voting records, clothes worn by people beaten during the march, and other artifacts of these social movements are displayed; and a room where people who participated in the 1960s marches can leave personal messages and chronicle their memories. The museum also features a large blow-up of a portion of an iconic photograph taken on the Selma to Montgomery march by Look magazine photographer James Karales.

In 1853, one year after graduation from Cazenovia Seminary, he was ordained and commenced a 15-year ministry in the Oneida Conference of Upstate New York. He was also cultivating his interest in religious poetry and music, as in 1858 he wrote the lyrics for \\"I Love to Sing of Heaven\\" (customarily matched to tunes by Charles W. Dunbar or William B. Bradbury). While serving the South Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Utica, New York, Hartsough met publisher Joseph Hillman, a concurrence which was to have long-lasting effects even though Hartsough, for health reasons, had to request relocation to a drier climate. Hartsough transferred to the Utah Mission as its first superintendent and became presiding elder of the Wyoming District. In 1868, Hartsough, while in Wyoming but still in communication with Hillman, became musical editor of the Revivalist, a compendium of hymns and gospel songs which ultimately had 11 editions as items were removed or added. The Revivalist was published by Hillman in Troy, New York, with Hartsough and Hillman conducting most of their business through the mail. In 1871, Hartsough moved to a congregation in Epworth, Iowa. There, during a revival meeting, Hartsough finalized, and soon published in the Revivalist, the one gospel song (both words and tune being his) for which he is remembered because of its international popularity‚Äî‚ÄúI Am Coming, Lord‚Äù (also known by its first line ‚ÄúI hear thy welcome voice‚Äù). In 1873 the song came to the attention of Ira D. Sankey as he sang for Dwight L. Moody during evangelistic campaigns in the United Kingdom, where it became known as \\"Gwahoddiad\\" from its translation into Welsh. According to hymnologist William Jensen Reynolds, Hartsough during his ministerial career served 15 congregations and five Methodist districts. He traveled some 400,000 miles while making 9,000 ministerial visits to members in need and participated in 7,000 prayer meetings and other church gatherings. Hartsough preached approximately 1,500 sermons. He spent the last years of his life in Mount Vernon, Iowa.

Washington State Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission States have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions. In June 2006, the Pharmacy Board of the Washington State Department of Health rejected a draft rule proposed by Governor Christine Gregoire to require all pharmacies to begin carrying Plan B levonorgestrel.Jason R. Mau, Stormans and the Pharmacists: Where Have All the Conscientious Rx Gone?, 114 Penn St. L. Rev. 293 (2009). Governor Gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the Board members to reconsider or they could be removed. In July 2006, the Washington State Human Rights Commission warned the Board members that they would be personally liable for illegally discriminating against women if they did not pass the Governor's Plan B rule. In April 2007, the Board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from not stocking Plan B for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for \\"good faith\\" business reasons. When Ralph's Thriftway, a grocery store in Olympia, refused for religious reasons to carry Plan B, it was widely boycotted, leading Gregoire to cancel the grocer's longstanding account with the Washington Governor's Mansion. The only complaints for violating the Plan B rule were filed against the grocer. The grocer sued but, instead of alleging violations of the broader Constitution of Washington, its attorneys at the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty only filed under the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution.Noel E. Horton, Article I, Section 11: A Poor \\"Plan B\\" for Washington's Religious Pharmacists\\", 85 Wash. L Rev. 739 (2010). On November 8, 2007, U.S. District Judge Ronald B. Leighton granted the grocer a preliminary injunction blocking the rule.Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 524 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (W.D. Wash. 2007). On May 1, 2008, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judges Thomas G. Nelson and Jay Bybee denied the state a stay of the injunction pending appeal, over a dissent by Judge A. Wallace Tashima.Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 526 F.3d 406 (2008). However, on July 8, 2009, Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw, joined by Richard Clifton and N. Randy Smith reversed the preliminary injunction.Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 571 F.3d 960 (2009), 586 F.3d 1109 (vacating concurrent with filing of new opinion). On February 22, 2012, after four years of discovery and a twelve-day bench trial, Judge Leighton issued a permanent injunction blocking the Plan B rule as unconstitutional.Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 844 F.Supp.2d 1172 (2012), 854 F.Supp.2d 925 (findings of fact and conclusions of law). On July 23, 2015, Circuit Judge Susan P. Graber, joined by Judges Mary H.

The grocer's petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States was denied on June 28, 2016. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, writing that \\"the rules challenged here reflect antipathy towards religious beliefs that do not accord with the views of those holding the levers of government power.\\"Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, No. 15-862 (U.S. June 28, 2016). Public Records Act In Harris v. Quinn (2014) the Supreme Court of the United States gave home healthcare workers the right to not join their union. The Freedom Foundation reacted by filing a Public Record Act request for a list of home healthcare workers from the Department so it could encourage the workers to leave the union. The Department refused, then encouraged the Service Employees International Union to sue the Department to prevent the disclosure. The SEIU lost its lawsuit in the superior, appeals, and Washington Supreme Court. The SEIU responded by putting Washington Initiative 1501 on the Washington elections, 2016 ballot, which would change the Public Record Act to forbid departments from disclosing union members' names. The ballot initiative was approved with 70% of the vote.

Washington State Department of Health officials requested, from the federal government's Strategic National Stockpile (the U.S. government's repository of drugs, vaccines and equipment to be used in major public health emergencies), 233,000 respirators and 200,000 surgical masks. The initial federal response was disappointing. The SNS could provide only 93,600 N95 respirators and 100,200 surgical masks. After public criticism, the federal government announced it would deliver all of the requested items to Washington state.

It operated from 1927 to 1971. The train took its name from the maple leaf, the national symbol of Canada. The Maple Leaf was one of many trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971, and is unrelated to the Maple Leaf which Amtrak now operates between Toronto and New York City. The train operated on Canadian National railroad territory through Ontario, but west of Lake Huron it operated via Grand Trunk Railroad.  History  The Maple Leaf at Port Huron in 1970 The Grand Trunk introduced the Maple Leaf on May 15, 1927. The train operated on an overnight schedule between Chicago and Montreal, Quebec. In 1932 it began carrying a through sleeper for New York. In May 1937 the Grand Trunk renamed the westbound Maple Leaf the La Salle. The eastbound Maple Leaf was known as the New York Maple Leaf between 1938 and 1939. The name Toronto Maple Leaf was briefly applied to a Chicago‚ÄìPort Huron, Michigan train in 1938. In 1938 the New York Maple Leaf was one of several Grand Trunk trains to receive Class U-4-b 4-8-4 steam locomotives built by the Lima Locomotive Works. The Maple Leaf operated on a daytime schedule between Chicago and Toronto in the 1950s. It carried a Chicago‚ÄìMontreal through sleeper, a Chicago‚ÄìDetroit through coach, a Port Huron‚ÄìToronto cafe/parlor car, parlor cars, and coaches. A dining car operated between Chicago and Lansing, Michigan. The Montreal sleeper ended in 1958. By 1956 the main part of the route circumvented Detroit and went through Port Huron, and served Detroit via a spur branch from London, Ontario. 1956 Canadian National railway timetable http://streamlinermemories.info/CAN/CN56-9TT.pdf In 1966 the Grand Trunk renamed the westbound Inter-City Limited the Maple Leaf, thus making the Maple Leaf a daytime round-trip between Chicago and Toronto. After the truncation of the International Limited to Port Huron on June 23, 1970, the Maple Leaf was the Grand Trunk train on the Chicago‚ÄìToronto route. Amtrak discontinued all remaining Grand Trunk trains when it began operations in 1971. Service over the Grand Trunk resumed on September 15, 1974, with the introduction of the Blue Water Limited.

He studied for his medical degree at the University of Pisa. He was trained in pathology under the German pathologist Rudolf Virchow. He worked in medical services at Florence, Palermo, and Rome. He was Chair of Pathology at the Sapienza University of Rome. He was known to the public for his service during cholera outbreak and in establishing hospitals, particularly the Institute for Experimental Hygiene (Istituto di Igiene Sperimentale) in Rome. He was elected to Italian Senate during 1892‚Äì1893. He, with Edwin Klebs, discovered that typhoid and diphtheria were caused by bacteria. However, they made mistake in declaring that a bacterium (which they called Bacillus malariae) was also responsible for malaria.  Biography  Tommasi-Crudeli was the eldest son of Peter Tommasi (the surname Tommasi-Crudeli was adopted later) and Elisa Gatteschi. His father was a Medical Officer at Pieve Santo Stefano, and his mother a landowner. He had three brothers, Stefano, Eugenio, and Adele. He completed medical course and obtained MD degree from the University of Pisa. He went to France and Germany to have further training in pathology and worked with Rudolf Virchow at the University of Berlin. In 1859 the Second Italian War of Independence broke out which prompted Tommasi-Crudeli to go home and fight for his country. He volunteered as army physician, and was posted as lieutenant doctor among the troop called Hunters of the Apennines under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi. He was wounded at the war front in Milazzo, and then again at Messina. By the end of the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866 his bravery had earned him Honorary Major of the 77th infantry. In 1866 he was designated by the Italian government to control an outbreak of cholera in Palermo, where the disease was rampant among the soldiers. He was successful. In between the wars, in 1864 Tommasi-Crudeli was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the Institute of Florence. The following year, he became Chair and Professor of Pathological Anatomy at the University of Palermo. He taught there till 1870. In 1870 he was offered a post at the newly established Physiological and Pathological Institute of the University of Rome. He became Director and Professor of Pathological Anatomy until his retirement in 1886. He continued as Professor Emeritus to his last day. He was elected member of Senate of the Kingdom of Italy in 1892 and served as member of the Standing Committee on Finance. Tommasi-Crudeli married Bianca Fortini (who died at the time of Palermo cholera outbreak), but they had no children. He remarried Sophia Ingham-Whitaker, who predeceased him just before his own death.  Honours and recognitions  Tommasi-Crudeli was decorated with Silver Medal of Military Valour for his service in the Italian Army. He was appointed Director of The Courier Sicilian during 1868 to 1869. He was elected Member of the Society of Medical Physics of Florence in 1862, Extraordinary member of the Higher Council of Education (during 1871 to 1873, and 1874 to 1881), National member of the Accademia dei Lincei on 2 January 1874. He became Member of the Higher Council of Education between 1893 and 1897, and between 1898 and 1900. He was founder of several hospitals in Palermo, the Hospital of Alcamo, Villa Sofia, dell'Istituto fisiopatologico di Spirito (Institute of Pathophysiology of the Holy Spirit in 1871), and the Institute of Experimental Hygiene at University of Rome (in 1883). He was Director of the Institute of Experimental Hygiene, University of Rome from 1883 to 1886. But the institute was officially inaugurated only in 1885 when a separate building was opened at Viminale Square. He was conferred Knight of the Order of Savoy Civil on 20 February 1898.  Bacillus theory of malaria  Tommasi- Crudeli, along with German pathologist Edwin Klebs, made several discoveries that bacteria caused diseases such as typhoid and diphtheria. They discovered a new bacterium from mud and waters in 1879. This was the period of intense research for discovery of the causative agent and transmission of malaria. They found the short rod-shaped bacillus while investigating Roman Campagna. They believed that the bacteria was the pathogen for malaria as they discovered from damp soil in the region of malaria epidemics. They further claimed that through experimental injection in rabbits, the bacterium produced symptoms of malaria such as enlargement of spleen and fever. They theorised that malaria was spread by drinking bacteria-contaminated water or inhalation from air. They even gave the scientific name Bacillus malariae. Klebs reported that antimalarial drug quinine killed the germ. The discovery was supported by leading malariologists of the time. When the news spread, it was declared that the malaria problem was solved. But an American physician George Miller Sternberg proved that the bacillus did not cause specific symptoms of malaria in 1881. The bacillus theory was eventually proved wrong by the experimental demonstration of the mosquito-malaria theory in 1898.

On 15 June, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the teens had been kidnapped by Hamas, which Hamas denied. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas maintained that as of 22 June there was no evidence that Hamas was behind the kidnapping. On 25 July, BBC correspondent Jon Donnison tweeted that Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld stated that the kidnappings did not occur on the orders of, or with the knowledge of the Hamas leadership, and that the crime was the action of a \\"lone cell\\".\\"Hamas not complicit in teens‚Äô kidnap: Israeli police\\", The Daily Star, 26 July 2014; \\"Israeli police spokes Mickey Rosenfeld also said if kidnapping had been ordered by Hamas leadership, they'd have known about it in advance.\\"Katie Zavadski, \\"It Turns Out Hamas May Not Have Kidnapped and Killed the 3 Israeli Teens After All\\", New York Magazine, 25 July 2014.Peter Walker, Tom McCarthy \\"Gaza crisis: Kerry says ceasefire deal remains out of reach\\", The Guardian, 25 July 2014; [5:45 pm]: \\"'Israeli police MickeyRosenfeld tells me men who killed 3 Israeli teens def lone cell, hamas affiliated but not operating under leadership\\", Donnison tweets' Sheera Frenkel had reported similar views from Israel and Palestinian sources some ten days earlier.Sheera Frenkel, \\"Who Was Behind The Kidnapping Of Three Israeli Teens, And Why Are They So Hard To Find?\\", Buzzfeed, 15 June 2014; \\"The kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers was likely carried out by a small group of militants with no direct orders from Hamas, ISIS, or any other regional terror group, said senior Israeli and Palestinian officials Sunday ...

Those attacks, they added, were harder to defend against as there was often no intelligence warning leading up to the attack. \\"What we do know, is that this was likely an opportunistic move.

According to court documents, Qawasmeh stated that Hamas members in Gaza financed the recruitment and arming of the killers. Hussam Qawasmeh's lawyers stated that he confessed under \\"heavy torture\\" from Israeli security services, Shin Bet.

On 26 June, the Israel Security Agency released the identities of two Hamas suspects in the kidnapping. Both ISA and Palestinian authorities said that the two men have been missing since the night of the kidnapping, and the ISA stated that both had engaged in terrorism, been arrested, and served time in the past, and were considered suspects immediately after the kidnapping. A senior Palestinian intelligence official said off the record that their disappearance constituted clear evidence the two suspects have links with the abduction. On 30 June, search teams found the bodies of the three missing teenagers in a field north-west of Hebron. They had apparently been shot dead shortly after the abduction. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a tough response to the killings. On 20 August 2014, a Hamas official Salah al-Arouri, who had been publicly identified as the mastermind of the operation several days after the kidnapping, on 19 June, said that the organization's armed wing, the Izz ad- Din al-Qassam Brigades, was behind the kidnapping and murder.Hamas kidnapped three teenagers, leading figure says The Telegraph Retrieved 22 August 2014 The Shin Bet had been investigating him in the belief that he ran a major Hamas network in the West Bank, headed by Riad Nasser of Deir Qadis, near Ramallah, and that he was behind the kidnapping. Following this line of investigation may have delayed the capture of Hussam al-Qarasme, who was only arrested on 10 July. al-Arouri, one of the founders of Hamas's military wing, made his comments at a conference in Istanbul, where he lives in exile.Hamas official: we were behind the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers, The Guardian; retrieved 21 August 2014 The Israeli Defense establishment thinks that Arouri is unconnected with the kidnapping, and was boasting. Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said that some Hamas members had kidnapped and murdered the Israeli teens but stated that they were not acting on orders from the Hamas leadership, which he said, were \\"not aware of this action taken by this group of Hamas members in advance\\" and the first he heard about it was through the Israeli investigation into the events.

He praised the kidnappers hoping the action could lead to the release of Palestinian prisoners. According to J.J. Goldberg, the military indictment contains no evidence of orders from Hamas itself and strengthens the thesis that the incident was organized by the Qawasmeh family alone from start to finish.\\"Kidnap Plotter Indicted: Still Looks Like 'Lone Cell'\\", The Forward, 5 September 2014. According to Amos Harel and Chaim Levinson, the kidnappers planned to wait a few days, then contact senior Hamas operatives in the Hebron area, to manage the hostage and negotiate a prisoner swap with Israel. In their view it appears doubtful that any senior Hamas official would have been ready to accept that kind of risk. On 23 September 2014, after Israel killed the two suspects, Marwan Qawasmeh and Amar Abu-Isa (aka Amer Abu Aysha) in a shootout, IDF Chief Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz announced that Operation Brother's Keeper \\"has come to an end.\\"\\"Gantz: Operation Brothers Keeper has come to an end\\", The Jerusalem Post, 23 September 2014. On 6 January 2015, Hussam Qawasmeh, a member of Hamas, was jailed and sentenced to three life terms in prison for the murders. He must also pay $63,000 in compensation to the victims' families. Background 2013 was a calm period with the November 2012 ceasefire being largely respected, despite 50 rockets fired by Palestinians and 10 airstrikes by Israel. According to PCHR 44 Palestinians were killed and over 100 injured, while the Israeli Security Agency reported six Israeli fatalities (all but one from the West Bank) and 44 injuries. The first half of 2014 saw an increase in tension manifested by a higher rate of injuries. Among Palestinians there were 43 fatalities in the first half of the year plus 1860 injuries. Tension was also increased by Israel's opposition to the formation of a Hamas-Fatah unity government, with threats of sanctions and the burgeoning issue of prisoners and the violation of the Shalit agreementNathan Thrall, \\"Hamas‚Äôs Chances\\", London Review of Books Vol. 36 No 16 ‚Ä¢ 21 August 2014 (1 August) pp. 10‚Äì12 Mutual attacks on each other by Israel and Gaza continued, as did the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Mainstream western media ascribe the initiation of the major 2014 conflict to the kidnapping of the three Israeli teenagers. Some news analysts believe that earlier clashes might also have played a role in the chain of events. On 15 May, two Palestinian teenagers were shot dead during the Nakba commemorations in the Beitunia killings. An autopsy report published on 9 June proved the death of one of them to be due to \\"live fire\\", i.e. not \\"rubber bullets.\\"Ilan Papp√©, \\"The Historical Perspective of the 2014 Gaza Massacre\\", The Plymouth Institute for Peace Research, 21 August 2014. The Israeli Foreign Ministry web site emphasizes rocket fire from Gaza as being the reason for the IDF war on Gaza.  Victims  Eyal Yifrach, 19, lived in El'ad, Naftali Fraenkel (also spelled Frenkel), 16, was a dual Israeli-American citizen and lived in Nof Ayalon. Gilad Shaer was a resident of the Israeli settlement of Talmon. Eyal Yifrah was a student at the on King David Street in Hebron. The other two were students of the Mekor Chaim yeshiva at Kfar Etzion in the West Bank's Area C under full Israeli administration. Suspects =Initial suspected perpetrators= Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas killed the teenagers. But opinions were divided within Israel's security services as to whether or not the two suspects had direct ties to Hamas.Sheera Frenkel, \\"Three Kidnapped Israeli Teens Are Found Dead\\", BuzzFeed, 30 June 2014. On 26 June, the Israel Security Agency identified two Hamas members as key suspects in the kidnapping, whom Palestinian police noted, had gone missing since the night of the kidnapping. High-ranking members of Hamas denied that the group had any involvement or foreknowledge of the incident. The two named suspects hail from the Qawasameh clan, notorious for consistently acting against Hamas's policies and its attempts to reach an entente with Israel.Shlomi Eldar, \\"Accused kidnappers are actually rogue Hamas branch\\", Al-Monitor, 29 June 2014. Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal said he could neither confirm nor deny the kidnapping of the three Israelis, and he congratulated the abductors, because \\"our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation\\". Initially a number of groups, some previously unknown, claimed responsibility for the kidnappings: The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades (subsequently denied); a West Bank Branch of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Brigades of Global Jihad, Ahrar ar-Khalil (Liberators Battalion of Hebron), and Regiments of Hezbollah. It was not clear how true their claims were, and the middle three were not considered credible. =Suspects arrest= After the kidnap of the Israeli teens, Israel commenced Operation Brother's Keeper in the West Bank. Israel killed 9 Palestinians and raided 1300 properties including commercial and residential buildings. 800 Palestinians were arrested without charge or trial.Debunking Israel's 11 Main Myths About Gaza, Hamas and War Crimes Huffington Post Retrieved 23 August 2014 On 5 August 2014 Israel announced that Israeli security forces arrested Hussam Kawasme, in Shuafat, in connection with the murders. During interrogation, Kawasme admitted to being the mastermind behind the attack, in addition to securing the funding from Hamas. Kawasme stated that after the boys were killed, Marwan Kawasme and Amer Abu Aysha drove to his house, and they proceeded to bury them in Halhoul, the land Kawasme purchased only a few weeks prior. By the time of his arrest, Kaswasme had shaved his beard and received a fake passport, in what is believed to be, part of a plan to escape to Jordan. Officials have stated that additional people arrested in connection with the murders are still being held, but no names have been released. On 20 August, Hamas member Saleh al-Arouri, who lives in Turkey, claimed Hamas' involvement in the abduction and murder, according to an Israeli channel 2 translation. He continued on calling the men who perpetrated the act heroic. Hugh Lovatt of the European Council on Foreign Relations said al-Arouri's claim was \\"suspicious\\": it might reflect a desire to assert his relevance within the Hamas leadership or it may be true, and reflect a power struggle within Hamas itself. On 21 August Hamas leader Khaled Mashal claimed Hamas leadership had no prior knowledge of the abductions and murders and had learned about them through the Israeli military. The following day, NGO Shurat HaDin, contacted US Attorney General Eric Holder to request extradition of al- Arouri. Although Turkey and Israel do not have an extradition agreement, the US and Turkey do, which it can use to extradite those who commit terrorists acts against US citizens. =Suspects killings= The two suspects Marwan Kawasme and Amar Abu Aysha were staying in a house in Hebron when IDF soldiers and Israeli counter-terrorism members, Yamam, surrounded the building at dawn on 23 September in an attempt to arrest the suspects. Israeli forces opened fire on the building and reportedly called on the two suspects to come out. With no response the Israeli force began using a bulldozer to bring down the building. According to Israeli forces, they shot one of the men as his head rose out of a hole and began firing a rifle. After this man fell back into the home, likely dead, Israeli forces again opened fire on the house, utilizing grenades and other explosives this time, killing both men. Hebron governor Kamel Hmeid and Hamas spokesman Salah Bardawil both called the suspects martyrs. Hamas leader Khaled Mashal also called the suspects \\"martyrs\\" and \\"heroes\\". =Investigation conclusion= The investigation concluded that the kidnapping operation's costs ran to NIS220,000, a sum procured by Hossam Hassan Kawasmeh (40), with the assistance of his brother, Mahmoud, who was exiled to the Gaza Strip in the Gilad Shalit exchange in November 2011, to purchase the two vehicles and weaponry. The cars were purchased from Nuh Abu- Eisha, the weapons from Hamas operative Adnan Mahmad Izzat Zru (34) both Hebronites. His attempt to escape to Jordan, thwarted when he was arrested in the Shuafat refugee camp on 11 July, was assisted by his relatives Hisham Kawasmeh (45), Jamil Kawasmeh (38) and Hassan Kawasmeh (45) a Hamas militant. Two other Hebronites, Ahmad Ibrahim Mahmad Kawasmeh (64) and his brother, senior Hamas operative Arafat Ibrahim Mahmad Kawasmeh (50) for assistance in going into hiding, and the latter concealed them on his property.‚ÄòAbduction of 3 Israeli teens cost NIS 220,000,' Ynet 4 September 2014. On 6 January 2015, Hussam Qawasmeh was sentenced to three life terms in prison for the murders as well as a compensation payment of $63,000 to the victims' families. Sequence of events =Prelude= According to Israeli investigations, the seizure and killing of the three was organized by Hussam Qawasmeh, who had received $39,000 from his brother Mahmoud in Gaza, via a go-between still at large. The money financed the purchase of three M-16 rifles, a jeep, and the Israeli car, which was bought from a used-car dealer in Hebron after it was stolen from the settlement of Tzur Hadassah. Altogether, he met with Marwan five or six times before the kidnapping. The plan was to conceal one kidnapped Israeli in Marwan Qawasme's barbershop in Hebron, then transfer him to Marwan's aunt's vacant house. A first attempt on 10 June failed to find any hitchhikers. There was no intention to release the boys: from the outset the plan, considered amateurish and not professional, envisaged murdering the captives. The plot of land where they were buried had been purchased to that end some time earlier, and a refuge to escape detection had been prepared in an old house near Tufah where the two suspects hid in a disused cesspit for five days.Chaim Levinson, 'Israeli teens‚Äô kidnappers evaded army, hid in cesspool after murders,' Haaretz 23 August 2014. The car for the kidnapping had been stolen. =Week 1 (12‚Äì19 June)= Netanyahu asserted that the attack originated from PA- controlled areas, and criticized the Fatah-Hamas pact. In the first week, Israel added a further three to the six combat brigades already present in the West Bank. Close to 40 battalions were engaged in rounding up suspects, notably the Paratroopers' 35th Division and the Kfir's 900th Division. Other specialized groups, such as the Duvdevan Unit, the Egoz Reconnaissance Unit and the Airborne Rescue And Evacuation Unit 669 supplement the search force. Skylark mini UAV drones were deployed, and the Yahalom combat engineering unit conducted tunnel searches. Fifty Bedouin IDF trackers were also used. Day 1 Late into the night of Thursday, 12 June, teenagers Yifrach, Fraenkel, and Shaer were waiting at Geva'ot Intersection, west of the settlement of Alon Shvut in the Etzion Bloc south of Jerusalem, soon after 22:15, looking to catch a ride heading west on Route 367 toward Beit Shemesh and from there to locations in central Israel where each of them lived. The kidnappers intended to kidnap one Israeli. Apparently Yifrach, after accepting a ride, waved to the other two to join him. The Palestinians, afraid of giving their identity away if they spoke Hebrew, didn't dare object.Amos Harel and Chaim Levinson, 'One year after West Bank murder-kidnapping: What Israeli security got wrong,' Haaretz 12 June 2015. After the car veered off from the declared direction of Ashkelon, the three realized they had been kidnapped and Shaer telephoned the police at 22:25, whispering, \\"I've been kidnapped.\\" Eight attempts were made to page the caller's cellphone, without checking its ownership, and his whispered remark was taken to be one of the many pranks that night. No check was made to find out the phone's owner, or whether he was missing. Later, analysis of the tape revealed what the police failed to realize at the time, that the murders had occurred while the hotline operator was listening. Four and a half hours passed before Shaer's family finally phoned the Talmon security coordinator at 3:10 am to inform him their son Gil-Ad had not returned home. Only then did the security establishment take the case seriously, and Shin Bet and the IDF were alerted by the police. According to the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency, the army succeeded in tracing the call to the Sanjar region, the last cellphone signal being made at 23:20 in the Hebron area, when Fraenkel's and Shaer's cellphones had been switched off. Meanwhile, at 1 a.m. on Friday morning, Marwan knocked on Hussam's door and said, \\"I've murdered three Jews.\\" A gag order was immediately placed regarding the abduction on Israeli news services (the presumed identities of the kidnappers, acolytes of senior Hamas members, were known almost from the beginning to everyone in Hebron, but kept from the Israeli public). and, in lieu of concrete details, rumours proliferated. Controversy soon raged in Israel over the police delay in reporting the call. At 11:00 on 13 June, a \\"Hannibal\\" alert (meaning 'kidnapping') was issued. Based on cellphone and other data, Israeli investigators deduced that the kidnappers' car had stopped near Beit Kahil, west of Halhul, for 28 minutes. According to Palestinian security sources, a Hyundai i35, with seating for 5, with Israeli license plates, was torched on the night of 12 June, and subsequently found by Palestinian police from the village of Beit Einun near Hebron. This vehicle was believed to be connected to the abduction. The suspicion arose that the use of the car displaying Israeli license plates was a trick to lull the hitchhikers into believing the vehicle was driven by Israelis. The Israeli authorities had placed the emergency call recording under a gag order but it was leaked to the public, after which the gag order was partially lifted. It then emerged that on the first day, after Gilad Shaer's whispered message \\"They kidnapped me,\\" the taped emergency call also recorded a cry (\\"heads down!\\"), sounds of shouting, a volley of automatic fire, a weak voice sighing \\"Ai,\\" silence, another volley of automatic fire and then singing. The burnt car discovered that morning yielded evidence of numerous blood-stains. Israeli police assumed correctly that bodies must have been buried in that vicinity. What they did not know is that the bodies had been taken from the provisory burial site and reburied beyond the radius of research. Notwithstanding this, the Israeli authorities began to broadcast the message that the boys were abducted, not that they had been murdered. Days 2‚Äì3 On 14‚Äì15 June, the Hebron and South Hebron Hills areas were the focus of investigations by a large number of troops. Soldiers numbering 2,500 together with security agents, police, and special forces engaged in a manhunt, scouring numerous villages, including Beit Ummar, Beit Einun, Halhul, Dura, as-Samu, Tarqumiyah, Beit Kahil, Yatta, Taffuh, and Tapuah in what the IDF termed 'Operation Shuvu Achim (Return, Brothers/Bring Back Our Brothers),' and referred to in English as 'Brother's Keeper'. An anonymous \\"security source\\" claimed that little resistance was encountered because the local populations have become accustomed in recent years to regular night raids by the IDF. The sound of rubber-coated bullets and tear-gas canisters were heard. IDF troops entering a building to search on 15 June. Weapons found during Operation Brother's Keeper in Nablus Over the weekend, Israeli security forces also arrested around 80 Palestinians, among them senior members of Hamas, accused of being connected to the kidnapping, in a sweep that rounded up former government leaders, clerics, university lecturers, and militants of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad across the West Bank. In Hebron's Ein Deir Baha neighborhood Israeli forces broke down a door, apparently by firing a missile, after surrounding the house of Akram al- Qawasami. He, his 8-year-old son Muhammad and younger daughter Sujoud were injured by shrapnel, and two Hamas operatives, among them Zaid Akram al- Qawasami, were arrested inside. The military also fully closed the Hebron area and Gaza crossings, only allowing passage for humanitarian cases. On Sunday, Netanyahu said what he had only hinted at previously, that Israel \\"knew for a fact\\" that the abduction had been carried out by Hamas, a position the IDF had avoided explicitly stating. He did, however, not provide any evidence. Security officials remained more cautious, tending to accept the probability that a Hebronite Hamas cell was involved, but uncertain whether it was a local initiative to secure prisoner releases or an operation approved by the Hamas leadership in Gaza. A remark by Moshe Ya'alon about the \\"very heavy price\\" Hamas leaders might pay was interpreted by one journalist as hinting Israel might be mulling the option of resuming its campaign of targeted killings, this time against the Hamas leadership. Israel's Deputy Minister of Defense, Danny Danon, threatened \\"possible actions\\" in Gaza and Ramallah. Day 4 Overnight on 16 June, the IDF clashed with Palestinians in Jenin, where they ransacked the offices of Mustafa Barghouti's Palestinian National Initiative and confiscated computers, and 400 soldiers raided the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah, killing Ahmad Arafat Samada (Ahmad Sabarin) (21) with a gunshot wound in the chest. The Israeli army said he threw a brick at the Israeli soldiers. A dragnet rounded up a further 50 people, bringing the total of Palestinians detained to 150. Many arrests, including the former speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Aziz Duwaik, 66, were part of what IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz described as an extensive operation, and were not linked to the search for the youths, but were part of a crackdown to apply pressure on Hamas. Netanyahu's approach has been interpreted as aimed at driving a wedge between Fatah and Hamas in order to break up the reconciliation between the two negotiated in April 2014, and discredit both Abbas and his government, which has been backed by Western countries. PA sources noted that Hamas, in the unity negotiations, had undertaken to desist from attacks and bloodshed, and if its involvement were proven, it would be a breach of the agreement that would render the reconciliation null and void, a point repeated later in the week by the Palestinian Foreign Minister. Weapons found in Nablus during Operation Brother's Keeper on the night of 16 June Day 5 Overnight 16‚Äì17 June, the IDF arrested more than 200 Palestinians. Anything linked to Hamas was being targeted, an official source said. The IDF shifted its attentions north, and deployed 1,000 soldiers from the Nahal Brigade for operations around Nablus. In particular the Balata refugee camp and the village of Awarta were scoured in what a spokesman called '\\"cleaning house\\" in the \\"terror capital of Nablus\\"', and a further 41 Palestinians were detained, among them the manager of the Hamas-run television channel Al-Aqsa TV, bringing the number of arrests to 200. Israeli soldiers confiscated a large cache of weapons and uncovered a weapons manufacturing lab in Nablus. Conflicting reports emerged on Israel's collaboration with both the PNA and other regional governments. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, Yoav Mordechai, denied on 16 June that Israel coordinated the search with Palestinian or Egyptian authorities. However, Israel military intelligence confirmed that Israel was working closely with both the PA authorities and Egypt. Egyptian sources stated the same day that Israel had requested their assistance, and that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had issued directives to his security services to undertake negotiations with all parties. On 17 June, Israel defence sources said PNA assistance had been \\"very professional\\". Day 6 IDF troops in the West Bank on the night of 18 June. On the night of 18 June, Israel seized a further 64 Palestinians, of whom 51 were Hamas members who had been previously arrested but released in the Gilad Shalit exchange in 2011, bringing to 240 the number of arrests. In six days, the government sources announced, they had searched 800 structures, including the Al-Aqsa radio station in Ramallah and the Hebron-based TransMedia communications company, both linked to Hamas. They were taken in operations in Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Yatta, Taffuh, Dura, Beit Kahil, East Jerusalem, Idhna, Surif, Beit Ula, Beit Awwa, Deir Sharaf, Salfit, Audla, Tell, Beit Furik and Qabatiya. The overnight operations also secured the defenses of Israeli settlements. However, in the process 300,000 Palestinians were left under curfew, 600,000 in the area had their movements restricted, and Hebronites with permission to work in Israel, an estimated 20,000, were denied entrance into Israel and thus their livelihood, and, according to an IDF spokesmen, Palestinians preparing for the Ramadan holiday have \\"taken a hit.\\" Home Front Defense Minister Gilad Erdan also stated that Israel had identified the Hamas cell responsible for the kidnapping. Day 7 Overnight on 19 June, troops raided the Bir Zeit University's student union searching for incriminating evidence, finding promotional material for Hamas. The Prime Minister declared at a press conference: \\"We know more today than we did a few days ago.\\" The IDF arrested 25 wanted Palestinians in the West Bank, and searched 200 homes. Nine more raids were launched against Hamas social services (Dawah) centers. Moshe Ya'alon outlawed West Bank activities of the British Muslim charity, Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) because some of its offices employed Hamas members. In East Jerusalem, a social centre operated from a Beit Safafa mosque in Beit Safafa village, and a Sur Baher charity were also closed down. By night's end, 49 Palestinians had been arrested. One of the refugee camp detainees complained that soldiers had stolen $580 from his wallet. =Week 2 (20‚Äì26 June)= The funeral of 15-year-old Mohammed Dudeen, killed by the IDF in Dura during operation Brother's Keeper, June 2014 Day 8 Throughout the week, the arrest of Hamas leaders went quietly as they acceded to their detention, but by Friday, 20 June, sporadic popular resistance began to emerge. Three Palestinians were wounded in a raid on Qalandiya refugee camp, near Jerusalem, while another five were wounded in clashes at the Dheisheh refugee camp by Bethlehem, whose Ibdaa cultural center was wrecked, cheques and money from its safe, together with five computers, confiscated. Four of the victims were reportedly run over by an Israeli jeep. Also on 20 June, Israeli soldiers near the Qalandiya checkpoint in Ramallah fired live rounds at a group of Palestinians who had thrown homemade grenades at them. Mustafa Hosni Aslan, 22, received a gunshot wound to the head, and died on 25 June. Live fire was used according to the IDF in response to Molotov cocktails, pipe bombs, one makeshift grenade, firecrackers, and stones being thrown at soldiers at the camps. In Dura's Haninia neighbourhood, after a night-long raid, involving many clashes with local youths, to detain a person Israelis consider to be a terrorist, as troops were withdrawing, eyewitness testimonies reported that a retreating Israeli soldier fired six shots and killed 15-year-old Mohammed Dudeen. Twenty-five more Palestinians were arrested at Dura and Dheisheh, bringing the number of detainees to 320, of which 240 are considered Hamas operatives. The number of sites searched mounted to 1,150, of which 1,000 buildings were damaged, the figure including over 750 homes. According to Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki Israel had destroyed 150 homes by week's end. In another dawn raid on the Dean's Office and Student Union of the Arab American University in Jenin papers were seized, and Amir Saadi, 17, was shot in the shoulder. The villages of Arraba, Al-Louz, and Artas were also raided. Riyad al-Malki demanded Israel produce evidence that Hamas was culpable, stating that Netanyahu cannot \\"keep blaming one side without showing evidence.\\" He said Israel's massive military sweeps were unacceptable, with 300 Palestinians taken in exchange for three Israeli kids, but the Palestinian authority would act to prevent an uprising, for \\"if the situation continues as it is, this will end up (with) the destruction of what we have built in Palestine.\\" On Friday night, Israeli security spokesmen said the \\"noose was tightening\\" as troops were concentrated near Hebron, with intelligence officials confident that attempts to move the youths to either Jordan, Gaza, or the Sinai had failed. A spokesman for the Prime Minister, Amos Gilead, stated that Netanyahu's view that Hamas was responsible was \\"built on the base of firm intelligence.\\" IDF forces ransacked Bethlehem's biggest Islamic charity, devoted to orphan's care, in the Jabal al-Mawalih neighborhood and took away computers and files. Day 9 On 21 June, Israeli forces concentrated their investigations on villages north of Hebron, searching wells, pits, and houses. According to Palestinian reports, an elderly man, Ali Abed Jabir, either died during an altercation with Israeli troops who broke into his home while ransacking houses in the village of Haris, or was denied passage for medical treatment after suffering a heart attack. Israel sources state the house was not raided and, on being told of the heart-attack, an Israeli ambulance was called. A further 39 Palestinians, primarily in Hebron and Bethlehem, were arrested in overnight raids, bringing the number seized to roughly 370, 75 of whom had been released in the 2011 prisoner swap. IDF sources challenged the report, saying only 10 Hamas 'terrorists' were seized. Further claims of soldiers stealing money were made by villagers in Beit Kahil. In the village of al-Bireh, several houses were ransacked, and soldiers broke into the Noon Center for Islamic Studies and the Palmedia TC company where they confiscated computers and damaged furniture. The IDF said cash had been confiscated in 21 homes of the 146 homes searched overnight. Palestinian sources also stated that in a predawn raid in Nablus, a female reporter was assaulted and troops shot and injured two Palestinian teenagers. In the late afternoon three fire trucks, with pumps to empty pools of water, and an ATV rescue unit were rushed to assist special forces searching an area riddled with caves and wells north of Hebron, between Highway 35 and Highway 60, reportedly without concrete intelligence leads. Netanyahu reaffirmed that 'the information in Israel's hands unequivocally indicates that Hamas is responsible for the abduction of the youths.' Day 10 Street in Ramallah after IDF raid during Operation Brother's Keeper, June 2014 On 22 June, Israeli units shot dead two Palestinians and wounded another 11 in overnight clashes in Ramallah and Nablus, while nine (Israeli statistic) to 38 (Palestinian statistic). The list notes 16 from Hebron, 19 from Bethlehem and three from Jenin. were arrested and five charity offices were raided. Israeli forces also raided Abu Dis and Al-Quds University's law faculty, seizing flags and several computers. Ahmad Said Suod Khalid (27), an epileptic, of Ein Beit al-Ma' refugee camp was shot in the abdomen, back, and thigh, for refusing an order to turn back as he insisted on going to a mosque for dawn prayers. Muhammad Ismail Atallah Tarifi (30) was found dead on the roof of a building opposite an Israeli sniper position, an autopsy found he was shot dead by an M16, a rifle in use with the IDF. Mourners at his funeral in al-Bireh later complained that settlers from Psagot had fired at them, injuring one. Palestinians, protesting at the cooperation given Israeli forces by their own police, who dispersed crowds by firing live ammunition in the air, smashed four local police cars in Ramallah, and, once Israelis had withdrawn from the city, raided a police station in Al Manara Square. Abbas, affirming that he was not convinced Hamas was responsible, called on Netanyahu to condemn two earlier killings, and asked if the criminal kidnapping justified 'the killing of Palestinian youth in cold blood?' The Palestinian Prisoners' Society named 420 people so far arrested, claimed Israel consistently understated the numbers and refused to disclose where they are detained. On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority asked for an urgent convening of the UN Security Council, while mulling an appeal both to the High Contracting Parties of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the UN General Assembly to put an end what it considered to be \\"collective punishment,\\" \\"Israeli terrorist aggression against the State of Palestine,\\" and what Hanan Ashrawi termed \\"a reign of terror directed against a captive Palestinian population.\\" Day 11 On 23 June, 80 locations, including seven Hamas- linked charities, were raided from the Nablus to Hebron and Jenin areas, with a further 37 Palestinians detained overnight. Four money-changing shops in Hebron and one in Bethlehem were also searched, and their computers confiscated. The number of Palestinians under detention rose to 471. An officer interviewed on Walla! said that Israel, having achieved most of its \\"band of targets\\", would close the operation, and that the military incursion pattern in the West Bank, apart from detention raids, would stop within days. No clue to the teenagers' whereabouts, had turned up, but the operation, in crippling Hamas's infrastructure, had been a success. Netanyahu declared: \\"We've pretty much figured out who are the kidnappers‚Äîthe actual perpetrators, the supporters, the command structure‚Äîand there's no question, these are members of Hamas.\\" Day 12 Mess in Hebron home after IDF search, 24 June 2014 On 24 June 120 buildings were searched and four to 13 Palestinians were rounded up by Israeli forces in the Hebron area, Beit Kahil, Beit Awwa, al-Arrub refugee camp, and the Hebron neighbourhoods of al-Mahawir, al-Bassa, and al-Hawooz, bringing the number of sites examined to 1,800 and the number of detained Palestinians, in the IDF calculation, to 354, or according to Palestinian sources, over 500. As town searches and arrests wound down, investigators shifted their focus to interrogations of detainees and scrutiny of the 150 security cameras in the area in which the kidnapping is believed to have taken place. The IDF said it had no substantial lead on the boys' whereabouts, or fate. A lawyer for the PA said that in the wake of the West Bank round-up, the number of Palestinian minors detained in Israeli jails exceeded 250, and that the hunt for the missing Israeli youths served to cover up this fact. Day 13 On 25 June, 17 Palestinians were arrested overnight in Yatta, Beit Ummar, Hebron and Bethlehem among them legislative council members Khalid Tafish and Anwar Zaboun, both of Bethlehem, bringing the number of Palestinian legislators arrested in the campaign to 12. Of the 19 people arrested in Beit Ummar since the start of the search, 14 are minors. A Palestinian youth in Khursa, Younis al-Rjoub (18), was shot in the abdomen during a clash with Israeli soldiers. Day 14 On 26 June, the Israel Security Agency released the names of two Hamas suspects. The ISA stated that both men had engaged in terrorism, been arrested and served time in the past, and were immediately considered suspects. ISA and Palestinian authorities said they had disappeared from their homes on the night of the kidnapping, and ISA believed them to be integral members of the kidnapping group. Overnight, 136 structures were searched and a further 10 Palestinians were arrested in the Hebron area on suspicion of being terrorists. Fatima Ismail Issa Rushdi (78) died of a heart attack during an Israeli raid on the Arruba refugee camp. Nine youths were injured by tear gas or rubber bullets. Two boys, aged 13 and 14, were arrested in Dura. 44-year-old Ismail Ahmad al-Hawamda was shot in the foot, running away from a checkpoint in the Hebron district town of al-Samu. Despite the Oslo Accords stipulating coordination with the PA security service for Israeli entry into West Bank Areas in the Area A, in what was called an \\"unprecedented\\" move, Israeli units raided the Tunis and Rafidia neighbourhoods of Nablus and Balata refugee camp without prior clearance. Two hundred homes in Awarta were also raided. According to Israeli figures, state detentions numbered 381, of whom 282 are affiliated to Hamas. The number of locations searched rose to 1,955, including 64 Hamas institutions. Palestinian figures state that 566 were detained, six were shot dead, and over 120 wounded; two elderly people died of heart attacks during Israeli operations, and more than 1,200 homes were searched. =Week 3 (27 June ‚Äì 3 July)= Day 18 Modi'in Cemetery On 30 June, a search team located the bound bodies of the three boys on land purchased recently by the Qawasmeh family in an open field near Khirbet Aranava in the Wadi Tellem area, between Halhul and Karmei Tzur, about west of the former, just north of Hebron. A high security source revealed that: The ambulance carrying the three bodies was attacked by Palestinians as it left Halhul, the location where the bodies had been found. The Palestinians hurled rocks and paint at the ambulance, smashing its windshield and blinding the windows, but failed to cause the driver to lose control. Just after midnight, Israeli military detonated explosives in the Hebron homes of the two main suspects, Marwan Qawasmeh and Amer Abu Aisha. Day 19 The joint funeral of Yifrach, Fraenkel, and Shaer was scheduled for 17:30 on 1 July. Huge crowds delayed it for over an hour. Israeli jets and helicopters struck 34 locations in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip in response to more than 20 rockets being fired at Israel from Gaza. A 19-year-old Palestinian man, Yousouf Al-Zagha, was shot dead by Israeli troops during a raid in the northern town of Jenin. An IDF spokesperson said the man had thrown a grenade at the troops, while his family maintained he had been carrying eggs home for suhoor, the predawn meal during the fast of Ramadan. Day 20 A Palestinian teenager was abducted from East Jerusalem and murdered. Israeli police located the body within hours, and arrested Israeli nationalist suspects several days later. The kidnapping and murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir was soundly denounced by all of the families of the Israeli kidnapping victims as well as by many Israeli governmental and non- governmental public figures. =Week 4 and on (4 July and after)= On 4 July, Israel stated it was searching for a third suspect, Husam Dofsh, absent from his home since the kidnapping. A relative, Jihad Dofsh, had blown himself up in a \\"work accident\\" in a Hamas explosives laboratory in Hebron, and one of Qawasmeh's relatives had died in the same incident. Husam Dofsh was arrested in a Hebron coffee-shop the following day, after phoning an Israeli news site to protest his innocence. For about two weeks in July, Israeli military preparations began for direct fighting inside of Gaza, whilst Hamas rocket fire into Israel took place. The military publicly announced on 17 July that it would go into Gaza, an intervention that caused at least 25 soldiers killed and scores injured on the Israeli side over the 20 to 21 July period. Public opinion in the nation is strongly divided, with, for example, the newspaper Haaretz editorializing that the \\"soft Gaza sand... could turn into quicksand\\" and warning about the \\"wholesale killing\\" of Palestinian civilians. The campaign in the Gaza is referred to by Israel as Operation Protective Edge. On 20 August, Hamas official Saleh Al-'Arouri spoke at the conference of the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Istanbul, where he said the group's military wing was responsible for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens, saying it was an expression of popular will.Orlando Crowcroft [Hamas official: we were behind the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers] The Guardian 21 August 2014. Khaled Mashal, the Hamas leader, while recognizing that Hamas members were responsible, attempted to distance his organization from the killing two days later. Stating Hamas's opposition to killing civilians, he said the leadership had no advance knowledge of the abduction, which he regarded as a legitimate act by a frustrated people living under occupation, and that it had only learnt of its details from Israeli investigations.Hamas: We wouldn't target civilians if we had better weapons, Haaretz 23 August 2014. In July, demolition orders were handed out to the Qawasmeh and Abu Eisheh families and to Husam Ali Al Qawasmeh who was not a suspect in the killing but arrested for being a Hamas members. Despite protests from human rights groups, the families homes were demolished in August, displacing 39 Palestinians. Aftermath Following the kidnappings and the escalating firing of missiles by Palestinian militants towards civilians in southern Israel, Israel decides to embark on Operation Protective Edge. On 3 July 2014, the Israeli Air Force conducted 15 air strikes in Gaza directed at Hamas targets in response to a rocket attack from Palestinian militants. The previous night, fifteen Palestinians were injured in the IAF strikes and two buildings ruined Operation Protective Edge, became a ground war on 8 July 2014. On 11 July 2014, it has been reported by the nonprofit news organization Washington Free Beacon, that a series of bills in the United States Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives was launched, attempting to solve the boys' murder, based on Yaakov Naftali Fraenkel's dual US-Israeli citizenship. The new legislation, if passed, would offer a $5 million reward for information on the abduction and murder.US representative Doug Lamborn said \\"Naftali Frenkel was an American citizen who was killed by terrorists and the United States should not rest until his killers are brought to justice (..) amazingly, the Obama administration still supports this terrorist Palestinian government, even after the death of an American citizen\\" Accusations of collective punishment On Day 7, The Palestinian Authority declared that the Israeli modus operandi, of clamping down on towns with closures and continual arrest of Hamas members, constituted collective punishment. Amnesty International issued a statement on 19 June calling both for the release of the Israeli youths, their humane treatment while being held, and for Israel to lift several measures it defined as collective punishment in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and customary international humanitarian law. According to The Economist, \\"The Israeli security forces closed off the area around Hebron. Some 23,000 local Palestinians were barred from travelling to their jobs in Israel. A series of charitable organisations that used to be run by Hamas were closed down and a dairy, which employs hundreds of Palestinians, was demolished. Hebronites were prevented from travelling abroad.\\" In July 2014, the Geneva International Centre for Justice sent an urgent appeal to protest against the imminent house demolition of the homes of the extended families of the suspects and of Husam Ali Al Qawasmeh. The demolitions which the Centre designated as collective punishment would affect 39 people. Two scholars rejected the claim that the actions constituted collective punishment: * Robbie Sabel, a professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a former legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry, argued that Israel's actions shouldn't be considered collective punishment because they were aimed exclusively at finding the kidnapped teenagers and weakening the terrorist organizations behind their abduction and that in a search for kidnapped civilians, the arrests of members affiliated with the organization responsible for the kidnapping is legitimate. * Eugene Kontorovich, international law professor at Northwestern University and Hebrew University said: \\"rounding up suspects, or potential witnesses, is not punishment, but rather rudimentary investigative process; especially when the crime is thought to be committed by a complex terror organization, the number of potential witnesses is high.\\" Kontorovich cited as an example that police often arrest members of a gang after a crime to further investigate the perpetrators or criminal acts. Speculations on kidnapping motives Elhanan Miller, writing for The Times of Israel speculated that the motive for the kidnapping could have been to force Israel to release a large number of prisoners in exchange for the three teens. In 2011, Hamas had secured the release of over one thousand prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit whom they had captured five years prior. Some 300 prisoners are on a hunger strike against the Israeli practice of holding Palestinians in Administrative detention without charges for six months or more. Many Palestinians support the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers and civilians in order to obtain the release of these prisoners. In 2011, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinians in detention, many convicted by Israeli courts for lethal attacks, in exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier kidnapped by Palestinian militants. Some months before the 2014 incident, an 18-page manual on abduction techniques was published by Hamas. Entitled \\"Guide for the Kidnapper\\", it provided an operational guide that outlined the use of pistols with silencers, the use of backup cars, the choice of conducting the abductions on rainy days, a command of Hebrew, the renting of hideouts in areas to avoid arousing suspicions and suggestions to refrain from announcing the outcome of the kidnapping until the victims were secured in a safe house. The difficulty confronting the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which has an ongoing debate on the issue, is the coordination between the PNA and Israeli security services, which makes executing such operations difficult. Several prior incidents, such as the killings of Givati soldier Gal \\"Gavriel\\" Kobi and Baruch Mizrahi, a police intelligence officer, displayed exceptional, high- level skills, strict compartmentalization, and careful preparations for an escape route, features shared by the kidnapping. These elements resemble the carefully planned abductions of IDF soldiers by Hezbollah on Israel's northern border. Israel said that the IDF and the Shin Bet have foiled between 54 and 64 kidnapping plots since 2013. The PA said it had foiled 43 of them. The high success rate (95%) in blocking such plots is due to the very close cooperation between the security forces of both sides. Hamas has put considerable effort into kidnapping attempts through its large network. A week into the search for the missing youth, Avi Issacharoff cast doubts on the premise for West Bank operations, which in his view 'targeted the weak'‚Äîsince Hamas has neither a large or strong presence there‚Äîand argued that the operational order, if there was one, came from either Gaza, or abroad, perhaps Ankara-based deportee Saleh al-Arouri, or Khaled Mashaal, who appeared to hint a month earlier in replying to a letter from an imprisoned Hamas leader, after Netanyahu reneged on releasing a fourth group of Palestinian prisoners, that the Izz ad-Din al- Qassam Brigades would be his reply. Issacharoff concluded however that, \\"There isn't a smoking gun to prove the Hamas leadership is complicit in the kidnapping.\\" On 20 August, a Hamas official identified the West Bank Qawasmeh clan, a Hamas ally, for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens and shared their motives. Saleh Al-'Arouri of the Hamas leadership delivered an address on behalf of Khaled Mashal at the conference of the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Istanbul. In it he said: \\"Our goal was to ignite an intifada in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as within the 1948 borders... Your brothers in the Al-Qassam Brigades carried out this operation to support their imprisoned brothers, who were on a hunger strike... The mujahideen captured these settlers in order to have a swap deal.\\" Hitchhiking debate in Israel As events unfolded, the dangerous nature of hitchhiking in what Israelis refer to as \\"the territories\\" prompted a debate, regarded by some in the settler and religious Zionist communities as a kind of victim blaming, about the practice of hitching rides on roads in the Palestinian territories, widely regarded as a cavalier and irresponsible habit for the costs involved in redeeming anyone who is captured. The normal Israeli practice is one where drivers pull up, declaring their destination, and, by their accent, allowing potential hikers at trempiada (hitchhiking stations) an opportunity to examine the cues, before they accept or decline a lift. Such hitchhiking has long been a hallowed method of travel among Israelis, but as abductions and killings of hitchhikers, mainly IDF soldiers, began to take root in the 1980s, one incident in October 1994 led to the passage of regulations that forbade military personnel from resorting to this method of travel. To hammer the message home, recruits doing basic training are required now to view snuff films that highlight the dangers, and military police \\"abduct\\" and punish recruits who do not take it seriously. Israeli governments have not regulated civilian recourse to hitchhiking, and laws delegate responsibility to parents, expecting them to advise their children. The practice however remains widespread among the dati leumi community of religious Zionists for several reasons: many of them, as in this case, have children boarding in West Bank settlements, where public transport facilities are poor. Haaretz reported that for mitzvah-observant adolescents, it is \\"a rite of passage, a way of life, a declaration of independence and of ownership of the land\\". Retired Brigadier General, Nitzan Nuriel, a former counter-terrorism officer in the Prime Minister's Office, declared on Israeli television that hitchhiking had an ideological edge: it made a statement about who owns the territory. Reactions  An Israeli government official stated to Reuters news agency that Israel was looking to use the search as a pretext for a wider crackdown on Hamas and were looking into the legal aspects of deporting Hamas leaders from the West Bank. A Hebrew-language Facebook page calling on PM Netanyahu to assume his responsibilities and requesting that a Palestinian \\"terrorist\\" be executed every hour until the three youths are restored to their families, gained 10,000 thumb-ups within hours. With a perception in Israel, expressed by Thane Rosenbaum, that the sympathy long lavished on Israel is dwindling, the government stepped up hasbara efforts abroad, especially in Brazil where the 2014 FIFA World Cup has dominated the world's attention. An aircraft trailed a #BringBackOurBoys banner along a Rio de Janeiro beach. The families of the missing boys went to Geneva to address the UN's Human Rights Council. * On television, Netanyahu declared that \\"Anyone trying to harm Israeli civilians will be harmed in return.\\" * Israel's Economic Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel will make membership of Hamas a 'ticket to hell', branding it one 'of the most \\"lethal, barbaric organizations in the world\\". Both the PA and Hamas, he affirmed, formed a 'complete culture where Israel is [perceived as] Satan.' * 15 June. Moshe Ya'alon cited the kidnapping as \\"additional testimony to the cruelty and seething hatred that guides the terror groups in our region\\". * 'Israel has decided to perform a root canal to uproot everything green in the West Bank,' reported on Israel's Army Radio, green also being the colour of Hamas. * Israel's ambassador to Italy, Naor Gilon, declared that \\"Europe backs Hamas' government and the kidnapping of children and Israeli civilians\\". * 'We're witnessing the unrestrained brutality of Islamic terrorism, both in Israel and around us.' Netanyahu to Ban Ki-Moon. * 'Not only are the kidnappers terrorists, but so is Hanin Zoabi'. Avigdor Liberman, writing in Facebook of his Knesset colleague. * Rabbi Dov Lior said the abduction was God's punishment for anti-religious legislation in the Knesset and Israel's readiness to abandon parts of the Land of Israel. Yuval Diskin countered: If so, why did God arrange for religious boys to be kidnapped if he was angry with secular Israelis? * The Haredi Yated Ne'eman claimed that government policies aimed at drafting yeshiva students into the army against their will was the cause of the abductions. * 15 June. Jews and Muslims who work fields as part of the Shorashim/Judhur cooperative project near where the kidnapping took place met and discussed their distress for several hours. * 17 June. Jews many from the Gush Etzion and Muslims held a joint prayer session at the kidnapping site. Rabbi Michael Melchior said Islamic clerics were concerned and demanded the youths' immediate release, and Israel's distress was shared by Palestinians. Jerusalem Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Hawa recited the Al-Fatiha chapter of the Quran, adding that 'there is a wall between our two nations, and we hope to remove the wall separating the hearts of humans.' * In an interview with Globes Yishai Fraenkel, uncle of the missing Naftali Fraenkel, recounted that he had received \\"no few messages of support and encouragement from Palestinian sources\\" who had said they were repulsed by the kidnapping and were \\"praying for the boys' welfare\\". * Human rights organization B'Tselem condemned the kidnapping of the three students and called for their immediate release, saying \\"any deliberate attack against civilians is absolutely prohibited\\". They also cautioned Israeli authorities to uphold human rights and avoid collective punishment of the local population in their efforts to bring the students home safely. Later B'Tselem condemned the killing of the three students by saying \\"deliberate targeting of civilians undermines all moral, legal and human principles. The deliberate killing of civilians is defined as a grave breach of international humanitarian law, and cannot be justified, regardless of the circumstances\\". * Knesset Member Hanin Zoabi stated that the kidnappers were not terrorists, but frustrated people resorting to such measures 'until the citizens of Israel and the public sober up and relate to the suffering of others,' mentioning the mothers of Palestinians who are being detained without trial. * 'Three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped, but the two Palestinian kids who were killed [on Friday] were not even mentioned [in your broadcast]? The blood of Jews is more precious than the blood of Palestinians?' Hanin Zoabi. * On 1 July 2014, settlers started two new outposts, one on a hilltop in the E1 area near Ma'ale Adumim and the other near Halhul. * In late August, the IDF, acting on political instruction,AFP, 'Israel plans to expropriate 400 hectares of West Bank, army says,' Yahoo News 1 September 2014. announced it was confiscating 988 acres (1.54 square miles) of privately owned Palestinian land south of Bethlehem,Renee Lewis, 'Israel confiscates nearly 1,000 acres of Palestinian land in the West Bank,' Al-Jazeera, 31 August 2014. as a response to the killing of the teens. Naftali Bennett described the move as an \\"appropriate Zionist response to murder\\", adding: \\"What we did yesterday was a display of Zionism. Building is our answer to murder.\\"'UK, France condemn Israeli decision to appropriate West Bank land,'Ynet, 1 September 2014: 'Israeli media reported the move was in response to the kidnapping and murder of the three Israeli teens.' The U.S. rebuked the move as 'counter-productive', while France condemned it and Britain deplored the decision stating that it 'would seriously damage Israel's international reputation.' Defining the area as state land rather than private Palestinian land was hailed by the Gush Etzion settlements council as an opportunity to build up Gva'ot, an illegal Israeli settlement of 16 families.'Israel confiscates 1,000 acres of Palestinian land south of Bethlehem,' Ma'an News Agency 31 August 2014.Peter Beaumont,'Huge new Israeli settlement in West Bank condemned by US and UK,' The Guardian 1 September 2014. Robert Fisk stated that it was the first time Palestinian land had been seized, not on God's warrant, or security grounds, or because of deed of title, but for revenge, a measure which set a dangerous precedent.Robert Fisk, 'Israel‚Äôs ‚Äòland for lives‚Äô is theft. Pure and simple,'The Independent 2 September 2014. Social media in Israel \\"Bring back our boys\\" on Jerusalem bus, June 2014. A social media campaign was started soon after the kidnapping advocating for the safe return of the teens under the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys. According to Robert Mackey, the campaign was initiated by a \\"group of Israelis trained to promote their country online\\" The campaign's label attempted to make the link between the then-recent #BringBackOurGirls campaign following the Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping in Nigeria. One of the organizers stated the social media effort \\"is simply a cry out to the world to bring those boys back\\", adding that \\"We're only trying to do whatever we can to help the international community to put pressure to release those kids\\". On 15 June, around 25,000 people gathered for a prayer at the Western Wall for the release of the kidnapped teenagers. Violent Israeli reactions On the night of 1 July a Palestinian family registered a complaint at police concerning an attempt to kidnap their child, 10-year-old Moussa Zalum, on Shu'fat's main street in Jerusalem. At the time, they reported, he was walking with his mother and brother when a car stopped and people tried to pull him into the vehicle. The child managed to wriggle free, and the car sped off. After the bodies of the three boys were found, settlers attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank were reported. Settlers from Tel Rumeida in Hebron were in the streets, attacking Palestinians and internationals. The Border Police stormed the hill towards the gathered crowd of Palestinians and internationals, exploded a sound grenade and injured a Palestinian in the following clash. On 2 July a 16-year-old Palestinian from Shu'fat camp, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, was killed; preliminary results from the autopsy suggest he was burnt alive. The boy's family believes the killing to be an act of revenge from Jewish settlers for the murder of the three Israeli teenagers. Netanyahu urged a swift inquiry into the \\"reprehensible murder\\" and called on people to respect the rule of law. On the evening of 3 July, Palestinians of Shu'fat reported to the Israeli police that four settlers from Pisgat Zeev had attempted to kidnap a 7-year-old local child, and had fled on being thwarted. On Friday Palestinians of Osarin near Nablus in the West Bank complained that one of them, 22-year-old Tariq Ziad Zuhdi Adeli, had been sprayed with a gas by settlers, abducted in a car, taken outside the village and then sustained injuries from a hatchet attack to his legs. Three days later, a video was aired, that appeared as the beating up of 15-year-old American citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir by Israeli security forces. Tariq, a second-cousin of murdered Mohammed Abu Khdeir, is a student who attends Universal Academy of Florida high school in Tampa, Florida. Israeli authorities then detained Tariq. The US State Department has called for \\"a speedy, transparent and credible investigation and full accountability for any excessive use of force\\". Israeli Border Police started an official investigation on 5 July.  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, defying widespread popular Palestinian support for the kidnapping as a means of securing the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, criticized the action, saying the youths must be returned, and that Palestinian Authority security was cooperating with Israel to try to locate them. Abbas' office released a statement condemning the kidnapping and the Israeli response of raids and arrests. At US urging, Abbas was working closely with Israel to coordinate the search for the teens. A PA spokesman stated that holding Palestinian authorities responsible for kidnappings in Area C of the West Bank, where Israel exercises full military control and prohibits a Palestinian police presence places the PA in an impossible position. The Palestinian Authority's official newspaper marked the kidnapping with a cartoon that spoofed the World Cup logo. Three hands hold the globe in the FIFA World Cup logo, but in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, three hands held small helpless figures with their hands up in surrender. While the World Cup logo says \\"Brazil\\" under it, the spoof says Khalil, the Arabic name for Hebron, a city near the site of the kidnapping. A cartoon on a Fatah Facebook page presented the three kidnapped Israeli teenagers as rats caught on three hooks on a fishing rod. Each rat was emblazoned with a Star of David, and the title of the cartoon read \\"Masterstroke\\". A picture on the same Facebook page showed a hand with words written on three of the fingers. Read in succession they said: \\"Three Shalits, long live Palestine\\". Hamas spokesmen Sami Abu Zuhri and Fawzi Barhoum criticized the PNA collaboration with Israel to track down the culprits, and Barhoum called the kidnappers \\"heroes\\". In social media, many Palestinians criticized what they see as the strong emphasis placed by Israel on the teenagers' disappearance to the detriment of Palestinian suffering, citing the case of two Palestinian boys shot dead by Israelis at a protest in Beitunia during a Nakba Day protest on 15 May 2014. On Twitter, in response to the IDF campaign, Palestinian sympathizers appropriated the hashtag as their own, drawing attention to both Palestinian prisoners in Israeli goals and Palestinian children killed by Israeli actions. One mentioned 5,271 Palestinian political prisoners, 192 administrative detainees, 17 women and 196 children. Senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials have stated that kidnapping Israeli soldiers and settlers is the only route to obtain the release of Palestinian prisoners. Palestinian Fatah and Hamas activists called on Palestinian shopkeepers and businessmen in Hebron, via Facebook, Twitter and other social media, to destroy any CCTV footage that could be used by Israel to help locate the teens. Fatah activists in Hebron also confiscated security cameras in order to frustrate the search. In the Gaza Strip, families of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel celebrated the kidnapping by handing out sweets to passersby from a protest tent that had been erected to express solidarity. Gazan Palestinians also released a song on social networks mocking the kidnappings, and called for additional abductions. A Palestinian group mounted a video on YouTube parodying the abduction, in a fictional scenario featuring an \\"Abu Saqer el Khalili Brigades, the Kick Ass Branch\\", apparently taking the event to be an Israeli plot with Arab complicity while mocking Islamic extremism. * Hamas parliamentarian Salah Bardawil: \\"We are capable of igniting a third Intifada which is an irrevocable right that will go off when more pressure is exerted on the Palestinian people.\\" * \\"I don't plan to punish anyone based on suspicions or because Netanyahu claims something. If Netanyahu has information, he should update me and we'll take care of it according to our laws.\\" Mahmoud Abbas. * \\"The world cannot stand by while Israel, the occupying power, commits such grave breaches of international law.\\" Hanan Ashrawi. =International= * Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon released a statement condemning the abduction, expressing \\"deep concern on the trend toward violence on the ground and attendant loss of life, including today of a child in Gaza as a result of a recent Israeli airstrike\\". He expressed solidarity with the families of the abducted, called for their immediate release and called for restraint on both sides. After the dead bodies were found, Ban Ki-moon condemned the murders of the three Israeli teenagers, calling them a \\"heinous act by enemies of peace that aim to entrench division and distrust and widen the Middle East conflict\\". * In response to proposals in the Security Council to make a statement to the press condemning the kidnapping, and the collective punishment and deaths of Palestinians, no agreement could be found: the US representative Samantha Power said that any direct criticism of Israel in the statement would constitute a 'red line' for Americans. * said that it was \\"very concerned\\" about the well-being of the teens, and that it was working with Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resolve the situation. After the dead bodies of the three teenagers were found, the US Secretary of State John Kerry made a statement saying \\"the news of the murder of these three Israeli teenagers‚ÄîNaftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaar and Eyal Yifrach‚Äîis simply devastating. We all had so much hope that this story would not end this way.\\" President of the United States Barack Obama responded to the deaths by sending his condolences to the families of the teenagers and condemning the \\"senseless act of terror against innocent youth\\". * 's Foreign Minister John Baird expressed deep concern over the event and urged Palestinian security authorities, \\"who have been trained through Canadian and US leadership\\", to make every effort to ensure the safe return of the children to their families. * After the dead bodies of the three teenagers were found, Prime Minister David Cameron described their deaths as an \\"appalling and inexcusable act of terror\\". * President Fran√ßois Hollande released a statement saying he was \\"shocked\\", \\"strongly condemn[ed] the cowardly murder[s]\\", and \\"extend[ed] his sincere condolences to their families and to the Israeli people and authorities\\". He attended that he \\"express[ed] his concern in the face of the increased violence in the West Bank and Gaza\\", \\"condemn[ed] the rocket fire from Gaza into Israeli territory\\", and \\"call[ed] for everything to be done to prevent any further casualties and the risk of an escalation of violence\\". * condemned the kidnapping, along with Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, and called for restraint. * After the dead bodies of the three teenagers were found, Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans issued a statement saying that the Dutch government heard the news of the murder \\"with profound sadness and horror. These boys were in the prime of their lives and have been the victim of a horrific crime. The government of the Netherlands hopes that their killers will be apprehended soon and brought to justice.\\" * 's ambassador to Israel tweeted that he was \\"deeply concerned\\" about the events and was hoping for the safe return of the teens. Catherine Ashton's office condemned the kidnapping after five days, in the wake of Israeli official expressions of disappointment. On 28 June the EU reiterated its call for the safe return of the youths. It regretted the increasing violence, particularly the killing of several Palestinians, and called on Israel to only use proportionate means in its search. It praised the Palestinian security services for their help in searching for the abductees, and condemned Hamas for praising the kidnapping. After the dead bodies of the three teenagers were found, the EU's ambassador to Israel, Lars Faaborg- Andersen, tweeted that he sent condolences to the Israeli government on the \\"despicable\\" murders, \\"with hope that perpetrators are soon arrested\\". * 's foreign ministry released a statement asking Israel to stop what it called \\"its collective punishment of the Palestinian people\\", after it bombed dozens of sites in the Gaza Strip a day after the bodies of three missing Israeli teenagers were found. Egypt urged the Israeli forces to practice restraint and allow the Palestinian authorities to take on its responsibility in tracking the culprits, it also renewed its condemnation for all forms of violence that cause the death of civilians on both sides. * 's Foreign Ministry released a statement condemning the assassination of the 3 teenagers that had previously been kidnapped on 12 June while on the same statement declaring the murder as an act of terrorism.

History Momba Station on the Paroo River and the Darling River was established by the brothers Edward and Frederic Bonney. Frederic arrived in 1865 to join his brother after both of them had been attracted to the country by their uncle, Charles Bonney. Frederic Bonney sold the station and went back to the United Kingdom in 1881 due to his brother's poor health. Bonney however recorded some important anthropology through his writing and his enthusiasm for photography. Some of his original images were lost, but his work has been published in two books and they include photographs of the Paakantyi.

In 1884 the property occupied an area of , and was the largest grazing property in New South Wales. At the time it extended north from the Darling River at Wilcannia and was wide. It was owned by the Momba Pastoral Company, the principals of which later formed Elders. From 1902 Momba was successively subdivided. Peter Waite owned the property in 1906 when he and other pastoralists in the area formed the Pastoralists' Association of West Darling. Momba was advertised in 1913 with a total area of and carrying a flock of 55,000 sheep, 44 cattle and 154 horses. At his time the property had approximately of double frontage to the Darling River including the flood plains and wetlands of the Paroo River.

Before the American Civil War, it was cultivated with slave labor. Location It was located in what is now the ghost town of Gay Hill near Brenham in Washington County, Texas.\\"GLENBLYTHE PLANTATION,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/acg01), accessed June 13, 2014. Uploaded on June 15, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. History =The beginning= It was established in 1859 by Thomas Affleck (1812-1868), a Scottish immigrant, nurseryman, agrarian writer and planter, who also had property in Washington, Mississippi.C. Allan Jones, Texas Roots: Agriculture and Rural Life Before the Civil War, College Station, Texas: Texas A&M; University Press, 2005, pp. 148-149 The name Glenblythe is Scottish Gaelic for \\"joyous valley.\\" =The mansion and facilities= The plantation house had two and a half floors. It included six bedrooms, two halls, a kitchen, a laundry room, a store room, a dining room, a parlor, three enclosed galleries, and two long galleries alongside the house. Next door, there was a lumber room, a carriage house, a granary, stables, a poultry yard, a pigeonry, and servants' houses. There were also six houses for farmhands. Additionally, there was another house for the overseer. Two miles away, there was a church, a hospital, a storehouse, and twenty frame houses, a sugar mill, a flour mill, a gin house, a press, a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, and another house for the mill foreman. =Commercial uses= The plantation was primarily used for agricultural purposes. There were fields of cotton, corn, barley, millet, hay, and sorghum. Affleck also bred stock such as sheep, cows, mules, oxen, and horses. The plantation was home to one of the largest and earliest plant nurseries in the American South, known as \\"Central Nurseries.\\" Affleck, who had studied agriculture at the University of Edinburgh, experimented with new crops and also discovered some plants endemic to the South. For example, he discovered the Old Gay Hill red china rose, which is native to Gay Hill.Judy Barrett, Yes, You Can Grow Roses, College Station, Texas: Texas A&M; University Press, 2013, p. 68 There was also a winery, where mustang wine was made with mustang grapes, or vitis mustangensis, for commercial use. Affleck advertised his wine in some of his writing. =Slaves= On top of the overseer and white farmhands, there were about 120 black slaves on the plantation. They were looked after by a black nurse and a doctor, who saw them at least once a month. In his essay entitled The Duties of an Overseer, published in his 1847 best-selling book, the Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book, Affleck emphasized the need to provide slaves with adequate food, clothing, medical care, and access to Christian church services, in order to increase their productivity. However, shortly after the American Civil War of 1861-65, he complained that his freed slaves had become lazy, neglectful, and disrespectful; by then, he had lost much of his financial clout.Thad Sitton, Dan K. Utley, From Can See to Can‚Äôt: Texas Cotton Farmers on the Southern Prairies, Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2010, pp. 26-27 =Civil War= The plantation played a minor role in the Civil War. In 1862, Thomas Neville Waul (1813‚Äì1903), a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army, was a guest at the plantation. During his stay, he organized the Waul's Legion, who used the grounds of the plantation as a camp.Stephen Chicoine, The Confederates of Chappell Hill, Texas: Prosperity, Civil War and Decline, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, p. 89 After the war was lost, Affleck rented his plantation to recoup his financial loss. He advertised it in the New York Herald. =Historical marker= The plantation home is no longer standing. However, in 1967, a historical marker was installed where it used to stand, as a reminder of a bygone era.

Location Gay Hill is located on Farm to Market Road 390, twelve miles North-West of Brenham in Washington County. History The settlement was first known as the Chriesman Settlement, in honor of Horatio Chriesman (1797‚Äì1878). In 1839, the second oldest Presbyterian church in Texas was established here by Reverend Hugh Wilson (1794‚Äì1868). A year later, in 1840, the Republic of Texas established a post office and renamed it 'Gay Hill' in honor of Thomas Gay and William Carroll Jackson Hill, who owned the general store. A decade later, in 1854, a Mason lodge was formed here. Later, a Baptist church was also established. The Glenblythe Plantation, owned by Scottish immigrant and nurseryman Thomas Affleck (1812-1868), was located in Gay Hill. He discovered the Old Gay Hill Red China rose, which is native to Gay Hill. From 1853 to 1888, Reverend James Weston Miller (1815‚Äì1888) served as the Director of the Live Oak Female Seminary, a defunct women's college. In 1881, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway added a stop two miles away from Gay Hill. As a result, the town was moved, and the former location became known as Old Gay Hill. The railway made the cotton industry more efficient, and it became an important transportation hub for the South. However, shortly after World War II, the cotton industry declined and businesses started closing down. By 1971, most residents had moved to nearby Brenham. The town is now a ghost town. There are no stores or schools in town. The main industry is ranching. The old Gay Hill School building has been relocated to Old Baylor Park in Independence, Texas. The Red House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Texas. Demographics By 1860, the population was 120. By 1936, the population had grown to 250. By 1958 however, the population had dwindled down to 200. In 1993 and again in 2000, the population was 145.

Because of its proximity to the Indian border and permanent presence of military in the cantonment area, Nurkot is a strategically important town. History The sixteenth century Ain-i-Akbari mentions Maingri Pargana of the Rachna Sarkar in the Lahore Subah of Mughal Empire, inhabited by Gujjars and Silhariya, as comprising 62,293 Bigha of agricultural land generating a revenue of 1.475 million Dams, and the local forces consisting of 20 cavalry and 1,000 infantry. The area was later annexed by the Jammu Rajas in early eighteenth century, in 1778 Kanhaiya Sardars took it and in the early nineteenth century it was annexed by Ranjit Singh. The area was then annexed by the British after the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849. Later on, Maingri became a Zail of Shakargarh Tehsil. In 1853, Shakargarh Tehsil of Sialkot District was transferred to Gurdaspur District and it remained an administrative subdivision of Gurdaspur District until Partition in 1947. Under Radcliffe Award, three of the four tehsils of Gurdaspur district on the eastern bank of the Ujh river (which joined the Ravi a little further down) ‚Äì the tahsils of Gurdaspur, Batala and Pathankot ‚Äì were awarded to India and only one, Shakargarh, was assigned to Pakistan. After the creation of Pakistan, Shakargarh became a part of Sialkot District once again. In July 1991, two tehsils (Narowal and Shakargarh) were split off from Sialkot District and Shakargarh became a tehsil of the newly formed Narowal District. Shakargarh was the gateway of Mughals entering Gurdaspur and going to Delhi . Shakargarh was also the gateway to Kashmir and regarded as the rest point for travellers. One of the main reason for its popularity was and still is its rich and fertile land for wheat and top quality rice cultivation. One of the superior land for rice cultivation in world. Nurkot was named after a prominent local leader 'Noor Ipu' from Monnan Clan of Gujjars who laid foundation of this town in earlier 18th or late 17th century.

The dam is part of the city of San Diego's local water supply system. Overview and operations Barrett Dam is located in a narrow canyon just below the confluence of Cottonwood Creek and Pine Valley Creek, about east of downtown San Diego. The dam is high above the riverbed and long, forming a reservoir with of usable capacity. The dam contains of concrete. The spillway is located on the face of the dam and is a stepped overflow structure controlled by gates. At maximum water levels the spillway capacity is approximately . To prevent flash floods from overtopping the dam, the gates are left open during the rainy season from November 1 to April 1. The dam's primary purpose is to store water for diversion through the Dulzura Conduit, a long concrete aqueduct which transfers water from the Cottonwood Creek basin to Lower Otay Reservoir. Water is released into the Dulzura Conduit via an outlet tower and a diameter pipe with a capacity of . Water stored at Lower Otay passes through the Otay Water Treatment Plant before entering the municipal system. Barrett is one of two dams on Cottonwood Creek, the other being Morena Dam upstream. Because Barrett is a deeper and narrower lake than Morena and experiences less evaporation, the city prioritizes water storage in Barrett. Water is moved downstream from Morena as long as storage space is available in Barrett. Resultantly, Barrett Lake is usually at a high level except during periods of extended drought. History The first dam at the Barrett site was a high concrete diversion dam built in the 1890s as part of the Cottonwood-Otay System by the Southern California Mountain Water Company. This dam's sole purpose was to feed the first Dulzura Conduit, a wooden flume that extended along the mountainside to the Lower Otay reservoir west. In 1913, the city of San Diego purchased this development for $2.5 million. Flooding in 1916 (ostensibly the work of the \\"rainmaker\\" Charles Hatfield) broke the dam at Lower Otay and overflowed the upstream Morena Dam, demonstrating the need for additional water storage capacity. The city began construction on Barrett Dam in 1921, under the direction of engineer Hiram N. Savage. In December of that year, unusually heavy rainfall filled the reservoir behind the incomplete dam, very nearly causing its failure. Over the following few months, construction was hurried in order to keep up with the rising lake, which was only held back by wooden flashboards as the water level actually exceeded the height of the poured concrete for most of the construction period. Temporary sluiceways had to be maintained in order to drain excess water from the lake, which consistently threatened to overtop the dam. By the time the dam was completed in 1923 it was said that \\"the value of the water stored behind Barrett Dam by the time the structure was completed exceeded the entire cost of the dam\\". Recreation In order to protect water quality, recreational access to Barrett Lake is extremely limited. The lake is open only Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and visitors are required to take reservations. Fishing is allowed on a strict catch-and-release basis.

As of January, 2015 this radio station now broadcasts with a regional license covering almost half of the country from the mountain top of Berish√´. Format 92.1 Capital FM broadcasts 24 hour program. Capital FM is licensed to broadcast on 92.1 MHz FM with a regional coverage, and also on the internet at its website. 92.1 Capital FM with its media content, the radio station has kept ties away from political affiliation and this is mainly due to its parent investors that are based in Canada. Of course, having no affiliation to any political groups it has missed opportunities to capitalize any funds from government media campaigns and corporations that are tightly linked to government officials. However, small businesses are its main source of revenue. Today the radio station format aims more towards younger generation (ages 16‚Äì35) providing more of a mix of Albanian music with pop, rap, Albanian folk, and American music. The late night show usually operates during the winter season that airs a talk show by the radio station director Lavdije Krasniqi and the sponsored clinical psychologist Hazir Elshani providing advice and information to its audience on health issues.  History  After the war in Kosovo, in 1999 there was a vacuum of information and the station started operating in the Drenica region for the first time in history. Initially the radio station started providing information and news helping people connect, and at the same time broadcasting local music, programs and talk shows about the humanitarian relief, and dangers of landmines in the region with the coordination of KFOR, and UNMIK. Also, it was an important tool to heal wounds of a war torn region that suffered heavy civilian casualties during the last conflict in Kosovo. The radio station with its former name Radio Drenasi began to operate on 8 July 2000 that started broadcasting 18 hours a day. In 2007 was licensed as a long term licensee by the Independent Media Commission (IMC). In 2013, after a financial difficulty due to bad management of the previous owner and in the brink of bankruptcy, the radio station was taken over by a Canadian-based company ALBATEC that started operating in Kosovo. In 2014, the radio station was re-licensed by the IMC in the ownership of that company. As of August 2019 the shareholders of ALBATEC LLC. made the decision to change the operating name by branding it 92.1 Capital FM. Ownership The radio station technical operation is managed by the Canadian-based firm ALBATEC CORP.Solar Panels at Transmitter Tower BuildingThe radio station has its own broadcast site in the mountain top of Berish√´ that operates using solar energy with a capacity of about 10KW, and owns the new studio location in 272 Dardania St, Fush√´ Kosov√´. Competition After the station started broadcasting for the first time in the region, within a short time many other local and national radio stations started to operate and become their competition. As the shows were taken over lead by a respected show host Elsa Muja the radio station took a great success competing against national radio stations such as Radio Kosova, Radio Dukagjini, and other stations in Kosovo. Current shows are hosted by Luziana Tahiri, a song artist, and Luljeta Krasniqi a Psychology graduate student as two main show hosts. The increase of coverage and technological advances in the studio and broadcasting network the radio station has a good coverage in the region. Despite difficulties with utility power from the power grid operator, the station has managed to take advantage of solar power and operate fully on solar during daylight making it the first and only broadcaster in Kosovo that uses alternative source of energy from the sun.

The Star also became known for its sensational crime reporting, which often included scandalous headlines printed in red. In 1983 the paper became embroiled in a legal battle when it printed a rape victim's name, leading to the U.S. Supreme Court case Florida Star v. B. J. F. A trainee reporter copied the police report, which included the victim's name, and the Star inadvertently included her name in an article.

He was known as a tusker because his tusks were so long that they almost touched the ground. The Tsavo Trust announced that Satao was killed by poachers using a poisoned arrow on 30 May 2014. Background Satao was an African elephant that lived in Tsavo East National Park, one of the largest wildlife parks in the world with a large population of elephants. He was thought to have been born during the late 1960s and to have been at least 45 years old when he was killed. He was estimated to be one of the largest elephants in the world at the time of his death and has been described as one of Kenya's most iconic and well-known tuskers (i.e., male elephants with tusks that almost reach the ground). Satao's tusks were over long and he was estimated to be the largest of the few remaining tuskers living in Kenya. It is believed that all of the remaining tuskers are in Kenya. Elephants at a waterhole in Tsavo East National Park in Kenya Elephant ivory poaching is a huge problem in Africa. In 2013, over 20,000 African elephants were slaughtered for their ivory. The slaughter of African elephants is driven by the black market value of elephant ivory. The illicit trade in ivory is primarily in Asia where ivory sells for several thousands of dollars per kilo. Satao's tusks were estimated to weigh more than each. Since 2007, the illegal trade in ivory had doubled. While China is the largest market, the United States, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines are also top markets for illegal ivory. The increase in poaching is driven in large part by organised crime and rebel groups seeking ways to fund insurgencies in Africa. Due to the great value of his tusks on the black market, Satao had been under nearly constant surveillance by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the Tsavo trust for the 18 months prior to June 2014. He typically remained in a small area of the park, but had started roaming into areas of the park where poaching was high. Because he roamed into a large , a dangerous area for poaching with thick vegetation, and because of the constant poaching attempts driven by organised crime and rebel militias, the KWS and the Tsavo Trust could not prevent poachers from reaching Satao. Also, Satao was featured in the Apple TV+ original the Elephant Queen however during their filming for the documentary, Satao was killed by the poachers. Death In March 2014, Satao was found with two seeping wounds in his flank from poisoned arrows shot into him, which were confirmed by veterinarians who rushed to the scene to treat him. After a number of days, Satao recovered from his festering wounds. Satao was last spotted alive on 19 May 2014. On 2 June 2014, Richard Moller of the Tsavo Trust found a huge elephant carcass lying in a swamp near the boundary of Tsavo East National Park. The tusks had been cut off and the face was badly mutilated, so the carcass could not be identified with certainty at that time. For about 10 days, Moller and Kenya Wildlife Service searched for Satao before concluding that he was dead. He was killed by a poisoned arrow shot deep into his left flank on 30 May 2014. Satao was officially declared dead on 13 June 2014 and the Tsavo Trust released the following statement announcing his death: Satao was a victim of the illegal ivory trade where ivory is commonly poached and sold by terrorist organizations to China, which has the largest market for ivory in the world. Arrests On 20 June 2014, Kenya Wildlife Services reported that service rangers arrested three suspects for killing Satao. Paul Muya, a spokesperson for the Kenya Wildlife Services said that they were tracked down based on intelligence the Service had acquired.

It began in downtown Burlington and generally followed the course of the Mississippi River north to Wapello. Most of the route was a part of the Great River Road. The highway was designated in 1931 and its course remained unchanged until it was removed from the primary highway system in 2003. It was replaced by County Road X99, though around Burlington, it is sometimes referred to as County Road 99. Route description Iowa 99 ran along the Mississippi River on the north side of Burlington Iowa 99 began at an interchange with US 34 in downtown Burlington, at the foot of the. US 34 is an elevated highway that connects to the Great River Bridge and Iowa 99 passed beneath along Bluff Road. Iowa 99 is joined by the Great River Road as well. To the east of the highway lies a park and municipal marina, both of which abut the Mississippi River. To the west, a bluff rises above the roadway. North of Burlington, the highway followed the base of the tree-lined bluffs to the west; it served as a divider to the farm fields occupying the river bottoms to the east. The road passed through the unincorporated community of Kingston. Near the Des Moines‚ÄìLouisa county line, the bluffs recede to the west as the highway approached Oakville. In Oakville, Iowa 99 turned to the west and crossed the Iowa River as the river bends to the north. The road followed the western banks for a short way as the river approached its mouth at the Mississippi. At Toolesboro, it turned to the northwest and passed the Toolesboro Mound Group, a group of Hopewellian burial mounds which date back approximately 2,000 years. Shortly after Toolesboro, at County Road X61 (CR X61), the Great River Road turned away to the north. Iowa 99 continued northeasterly until it reached Wapello. There, it crossed the Iowa River again, albeit further upstream, passed through the town, and ended at US 61. History Near Kingston in Des Moines County Iowa 99 first appeared on the June 1932 state highway map along its familiar routing between Burlington and Wapello. In Louisa County, the highway was a gravel road, while in Des Moines County, the road was unimproved. By 1939, the rest of the road would be graveled and from Burlington north to near Kingston would be paved. In the early 1950s, the middle section, from near Kingston to near Oakville was upgraded to chipseal pavement. By 1956, the entire route was paved. In 2002, more than of low-traffic state highways, including Iowa 99, were identified by the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) because they primarily served local traffic. Typically, when Iowa DOT wished to transfer a road to a county or locality, both parties had to agree to terms and the DOT would have to either improve the road or give money to the other party to maintain the road. However, with the significant mileage the DOT wished to turn over, the Iowa General Assembly passed a law which granted the DOT a one- time exemption from the transfer rules effective July 1, 2003. Iowa 99 was replaced by CR X99, though some signs in Burlington refer to the road as CR 99.

The advertisement campaign, spanning radio, television, out-of-home, online advertising and print media, was specially made for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and starring well-known football players from national teams and clubs. This campaign emphasizes the mantra of \\"risk everything\\" ‚Äì taking every dangerous life-or-death chance to succeed and outshine your rivals. Concept The campaign, created by ad agency Wieden+Kennedy, emphasizes risk-taking and what it takes to carry on a nation's hopes. The ads show players feeling the heat from intense neck-to-neck competition, fighting for glory and victory who suddenly arrive at a turning point in the football world ‚Äì or match ‚Äì and take a risk: giving an amateur the opportunity for a penalty kick or challenging perfect gameplay. Television Nike released three television advertisements in the Risk Everything series across the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries: Risk Everything, Winner Stays, and The Last Game =Risk Everything= Starring Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, Brazil's Neymar and England's Wayne Rooney, the advertisement focuses on the pressure superstar players face when playing for their country in the FIFA World Cup. Ronaldo is surrounded by his fans ‚Äì and advertisements depicting him ‚Äì everywhere and Portugal's hopes seem to be riding on Ronaldo. Rooney, on the other hand, faces skepticism everywhere he goes and Neymar, who is wearing Brazil's prestigious number 10 shirt, is trying to live up to his country's football fanaticism, the legend of the players who wore the number 10 for Brazil and World Cup aspirations. The ad ends the three players walking with their team to the pitch, preparing themselves for the onslaught and the tagline \\"Pressure shapes Legends\\". =Winner Stays= A group of friends agree to a pick-up football match in a park, with the winning team getting to stay on the field. The players pretend to be (and transform) into players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Wayne Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, David Luiz, Andrea Pirlo, Thibaut Courtois, Gonzalo Higua√≠n, Eden Hazard, Gerard Piqu√©, Andr√©s Iniesta, Mario G√∂tze, Thiago Silva and Tim Howard. The ad features cameos by Irina Shayk, Kobe Bryant, Jon Jones, Anderson Silva and the Incredible Hulk. As the match nears the end with a 2‚Äì2 tie and a \\"next goal wins\\" scenario, a young boy takes the ball off Ronaldo, and with immense pressure upon him from people across the globe watching the match, scores the penalty and wins the game for his team. =The Last Game= An animated feature created in collaboration with Passion Pictures, the ad shows the scientist, promoter of \\"Perfect Inc.\\", giving a presentation on how football players are reckless in their game play and \\"take too many risks\\". He unveils clones, which are programmed for perfect, no-risk-taken football and focus on efficiency, accuracy and risk mitigation by guaranteed results. The world of football (and sports) suffers from these clones, as they defeat the real players, put them out of business, and drive sports to near-extinction. Retired Brazilian football legend Ronaldo, who is saddened by this state of football, watches a young boy practising football tricks all alone and an interview of the scientist, in which he says \\"Before Perfect Inc. football was a wild and unpredictable affair. I've changed that\\" which fires him up and embarks on a mission to save football. He rescues the now-forgotten players: Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, trying to sell copies of his autobiography I Am Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá; Cristiano Ronaldo, who now works as a mannequin in \\"Sport-U-Gal\\" sports equipment store; Andr√©s Iniesta, now a farmer; Neymar and David Luiz, barbers at a beauty salon, trimming the hair of their clones; and Wayne Rooney, a fisherman. Along with Franck Rib√©ry and Tim Howard who were rescued off-screen, their spirits are raised by Ronaldo, who motivates them by showing them glimpses of their former glory and the death football is facing. There, Neymar takes a selfie on a statue. Rooney questions, \\"We all want to destroy the clones, but they all are unbeatable!\\" Ronaldo replies: \\"Nobody thinks that they can be beatable, but you can do it!\\" The players challenge the clones to a football match; the team with the first goal wins, and the losers quit football for eternity. The Players outsmart the clones with their skills despite the Scientist activating a fail-safe which introduces more clones to the field; the match ends with Cristiano Ronaldo effortlessly scoring a goal. As the players celebrate and the Scientist sulks, the entire world cheers and human players start returning to sports. A jubilant Ronaldo looks at the players celebrating, and exclaims, \\"Clone that!\\"  Internet  = Ask Zlatan = On 9 March 2014, Nike organized a question-and-answer session on Twitter with then-Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá; Twitter users asked questions to Ibrahimoviƒá by tweeting with the hashtag #DareToZlatan.

Keene. He serves as a Civilian Service Coordinator, providing technical support to the Los Angeles Police Department's Major Crimes Division. His duties include filming crime scenes, and he runs the audio and video systems in the interrogation room with what he states in Identity are his own cameras. He later starts training as a Reserve Officer in season 3 of Major Crimes and has started to take up those duties as well in season 4. By the beginning of season 6, Buzz has become a Reserve Detective and has started to take a more active role in investigations. In the final scene of the series, Lieutenant Provenza arranges for Buzz to attend the police academy for eighteen weeks. Upon Buzz's return, he will be a probationary detective within the Major Crimes Division.  In The Closer  The character Buzz Watson first appeared in the second episode of the first season, \\"About Face\\". Originally a recurring role, as the series progressed the character's visibility increased until Buzz became one of the central characters. In the season 1 episode \\"Standards and Practices\\", it was revealed that he speaks fluent Spanish, which he learned from his Mexican stepfather. In the season 7 episode \\"You Have the Right to Remain Jolly\\", it was revealed he had a sister named Casey, who was played by Christine Woods.  In Major Crimes  The character of Buzz Watson is a main/regular character on Major Crimes. In many first season episodes, he was bothered by being assigned the role of watching over Rusty Beck to allow Rusty's guardian, Sharon Raydor, to focus on work. Through the season, Buzz came to accept Rusty and treated him like a younger brother, acting as a mentor to the teenager.Tiffany Vogt, \\"We Shine the Spotlight on MAJOR CRIMES Star Phillip P. Keene\\", The TVAddict.com (originally published 10 June 2013) He tutors Rusty when he's removed from school due to Wade Weller's threats. In season four, when Rusty is frustrated by his inability to find a story for his burgeoning journalism career, Buzz uses subtle hints to guide Rusty into doing investigative reporting on Alice Herrera, a homeless girl who was murdered and never identified. After helping Rusty with his efforts, generally by acting as his cameraman, leading to the girl's proper identification, Buzz joins the squad at her funeral. In season two episode \\"Risk Assessment\\", Buzz explains to Rusty that he became interested in police work when his father and uncle were murdered in a robbery. He wanted to become a police officer to track down their killer but his mother was afraid of losing him too so he went to film school instead and became the LAPD's Civilian Surveillance Coordinator instead of a police officer. He's later trained as a Reserve Officer during season three and went on his first ride-along in season four episode \\"Turn Down\\", where he ends up discovering an apparent suicide is in fact a murder. Buzz then aids the squad in catching the killer both as a Reserve Officer and in his usual role. However, Buzz catching the murder leaves Flynn and Provenza annoyed as it causes them to miss a major Fourth of July Dodgers game. When asked, Provenza gives him a good score but with room for improvement as he made them miss a baseball game. He has recently started going for Reserve Detective. In the season five opener \\"Present Tense\\", Buzz begins looking into the murders of his father and uncle to fulfill the vow he made to himself when he was eleven and catch their killers. While Provenza removes some of the more graphic pictures from the murder book, Buzz insists on seeing them and tells everyone he doesn't want this to be the way their story is told. To this end, Buzz agrees to let his tragedy and search for justice to be the next story in Rusty's Identity segment entitled The Long Shadow which they start by going back to the scene of the crime where Buzz describes what happened before explaining to Rusty's audience that the victims were his father and uncle. With the help of the squad, Buzz gets the ATM security tape cleaned up and focuses on his search on a partial fingerprint left behind on his father's ATM card. After a suggestion from Provenza, Buzz began searching through similar unsolved ATM robberies for matching partials to try to identify the man who left the partial and in The Long Shadow Part 6 has had some luck, finding another partial that matches the one on the ATM card. In \\"Family Law\\", through identifying a witness and not a suspect, Buzz is able to use his partials to identify one of the men from the robbery, Gene Hecht who is serving a life sentence and whose known crimes include an ATM robbery three miles from where Buzz's father and uncle were murdered. Buzz begins the process of having Gene transferred in an attempt to gain his cooperation in identifying his accomplice, the man who was the actual killer. In \\"Dead Zone\\", Buzz interrogates Gene who gives him an alibi. In the following episode, Buzz questions the woman who not only breaks Gene's alibi but gives more proof towards his guilt as Gene was wearing a rare watch the day after the murder that had been taken from Buzz's uncle. With this statement, Buzz is able to get Gene to give up the name of his father and uncle's killer, Bill Jones and identify him in \\"White Lies, Part 2.\\" In \\"White Lies, Part 3\\", Buzz uses social media to identify a possible suspect for the Bill Jones he's looking for. Due to some amateur detective work, Rusty is able to get Buzz Bill's fingerprints, enabling him to confirm the suspect's identity. Accompanied by Provenza and several police officers, Buzz travels to Bill Jones' home where he discovers the man has a wife and kids, leaving Buzz uneasy. After allowing Bill to say goodbye to his family, Buzz personally arrests the man for the murders of his father and uncle. Buzz later tells Rusty and his boyfriend Gus that Bill confessed to the murders and the DA is working up a deal of life in prison without parole. However, Buzz is disturbed as Bill had two kids of his own and in arresting him, Buzz left two children fatherless as Bill did to him and his sister. In the final segment of Identity, Buzz states that Gene Hecht and Bill Jones both confessed in open court to the murders of his father and uncle and took deals that gives Hecht another life sentence in the prison he was already incarcerated in and Bill Jones gets life in prison without parole in a prison near his family. In \\"Heart Failure\\", Buzz receives a letter from Bill's son Gabe asking for Buzz to forgive Bill so he can return to his family. Buzz is left distressed as Gabe expresses that his father deeply regrets his actions and his arrest is destroying their family. Over the remainder of the season, Buzz keeps in close contact with Bill's family despite the squad's reservations about it. In \\"Sanctuary City, Part 1,\\" Buzz has become a Reserve Detective and takes an active role in an investigation on Sharon's request due to Julio being on bereavement leave. Along with continuing to monitor interrogations, Buzz performs one of his own, joins Provenza in an official capacity in visiting a hostile neighbor, though he carries his camera in case the man's daughter will talk to them and leads a search of one of the victim's houses. While leading this search, Buzz's understanding of Spanish allows he and his team to locate a million dollars the victim's parents are trying to hide as they are unaware Buzz can understand them talking about where they don't want the police to search. After Julio's early return in \\"Sanctuary City, Part 3,\\" a visibly disappointed Buzz resumes his usual role though he continues to help with the case by finding evidence they can use against Marvin Garret. Shortly before her death in \\"Conspiracy Theory, Part 4,\\" Sharon borrows Buzz's camera to record final messages to her family. Aware that she does not have much longer to live, Sharon leaves the messages and instructions to not give them to her family until a week after her funeral with Buzz. After Phillip Stroh is revealed to have indeed returned in \\"By Any Means, Part 1,\\" Buzz gives out the messages early. In particular, Buzz gives Rusty his private message from Sharon and urges Rusty to view it in light of the threat from Stroh. In the \\"By Any Means\\" arc, Buzz takes on a greater role in the investigation into Phillip Stroh's renewed murder spree. In \\"By Any Means, Part 3,\\" Buzz realizes that Major Crimes has been hacked and discreetly alerts the others. Buzz joins the meeting with Assistant Chief Mason and argues for laying a trap for Stroh's accomplice, Dylan Baxter despite Buzz acknowledging that he usually just \\"turns things on and off around here.\\" To the surprise of everyone, Mason asks for Buzz's opinion over Tao's after Buzz speaks up and agrees with the argument that Buzz presents for laying a trap and the low risks it has. In \\"By Any Means, Part 4,\\" while the rest of the LAPD is surrounding the airport Stroh is supposedly fleeing the country from, Rusty insists upon checking on Tammy Bechtel, Stroh's ex-stepsister. With no other backup available, Provenza reinstates Buzz as a Reserve Detective and has Buzz act as his backup. In the process, Provenza has Buzz break down the woman's front door, but he does the worst job of it that Provenza has ever seen. Armed with a gun, Buzz helps to clear the Bechtel home and finds Tammy's body. However, in order to get a chance to kill Stroh, Provenza orders Buzz not to call in the murder yet and to remain behind with his camera, timestamp off, to record the murder scene. In the final scene of Major Crimes, Provenza announces to Buzz at Julio's promotion ceremony that he has arranged for Buzz to attend the police academy for the next eighteen weeks. When Buzz returns, he will be a probationary detective and a full member of the squad instead of officially being their Civilian Surveillance Coordinator. Provenza jokes to an excited Buzz that he did it just to keep Buzz from quoting his Reserve Detective classes anymore.

Led by Stewart (Leadfinger) Cunningham, the band released many 7\\" vinyl singles and 1 album in its time and contained members of many other successful Australian bands. History The original line-up of Brother Brick was formed following the demise of The Proton Energy Pills from Wollongong and The Horny Toads from Sydney and featured former Protons guitarist Stewart Leadfinger Cunningham and former Horny Toads Bassplayer Kurt Anderson and Drummer, Mikey J Stephenson. The Horny Toads were originally formed in Brisbane but moved to Sydney in 1988 and over the next 2 years they played many gigs with The Proton Energy Pills at venues such as The Lansdowne Hotel, The Journos Club and The Hopetoun Hotel. Both bands were 5 piece 'rock' bands and had much in common musically being inspired by many of the same seminal acts Radio Birdman, Blue √ñyster Cult and The MC5. Other members of these two bands also went on to play in The Dubrovniks, Tumblweed and Leadfinger. After previously playing in classic 5 piece 'Detroit' style rock bands the 3 founding members of Brother Brick made a conscious decision to play a different style of music to their previous bands. Keeping to the stripped back line up and inspired by bands such as X, The Eastern Dark, The Saints, Mot√∂rhead, The Wipers and Husker-Du all 3 members shared vocal duties and contributed to the songwriting. They sought out a more edgier and original style of rock that also took in elements of punk and 60's blues rock such as Cream and Hendrix. They played live regularly in Sydney mostly at smaller pub venues like The Evil Star, The Lansdowne Hotel, The Vic on the Park Hotel and the Manly Vale Hotel but were ignored by the bigger venues and booking agents. Brother Brick made the long trips to Melbourne and Brisbane many times playing with like minded bands such as The Powder Monkeys, Freeloaders, The Splatterheads and Asteroid B-612 and scoring support spots with the likes of Nomeansno, Deniz Tek, The Hitmen and The Celibate Rifles. This line up of Brother Brick had built up a solid live reputation and a reputation for no holds barred attitude but split up in 1994 following the release of a Cd EP and two 7\\" singles, most notably the 'Chokito Bar' 7\\" on Dog Meat Records. The following year Cunningham resumed Brother Brick with a new line up that included Scott Nash Asteroid B-612 on Bass and Craig Jackson on Drums. Continuing with the 3 piece format but with Cunningham taking over all vocal duties, this line-up of the band did not play live very often and instead focused on preparing to record what would become Brother Brick's only album, the prophetically titled 'A Portable Altamont'. The album was recorded on a shoe string budget at Powerhouse Studio in Waterloo, Sydney but the release delayed whilst Nash and Cunningham focused on their duties with Asteroid B-612 - Cunningham having officially joined that band following the demise of the original Brother Brick. Further delays were caused when first Nash and then Jackson both left the band and the subsequent loss of the master CD of the album stalled the existence of the band completely in 1997. It wasn't until almost 2 years later when Cunningham found a cassette copy of the master CD that the band reconvened with Jay Curley (Tumbleweed, The Proton Energy Pills) on Bass and Ashley Thomson (The Kelpies, The Panadolls) on Drums. There had been considerable interest in the band from Europe and US during the unfortunate hiatus and this gave the band new life and enabled the release of the album and a bunch of singles in the US and Europe. This final line up of Brother Brick failed to record but played live regularly in support of the new releases. They supported touring bands like Dead Moon, Zeke, Jad Fair and played with local acts like The Powder Monkeys, The Onyas and The Bloodsucking Freaks. The Brother Brick album 'A Portable Altamont' was well received by critics and fans, with a few of the songs that were written back in the first lineup of the band finally seeing a proper recorded release. Brother Brick played their final gig in June 2000 at the Zetland Hotel in Sydney. In 2006, Melbourne-based Record Label, Off the Hip released a double CD retrospective on the band that included all of their studio recordings and many unreleased demo's, live recordings and extensive liner notes. The release was titled 'Stranded in the Nineties', a phrase taken from the game of Cricket that refers to a player almost making a century but running out of time and batting partners, it was chosen to reflect the bands status as terminal underachievers, a virtually unknown group playing a distinctly Australian style of high energy rock'n'roll that failed to register a blip in Australia during a decade that was overrun by imported grunge, slacker rock and Nirvana wannabes.

Lanthanum manganite is formed in the perovskite structure, consisting of oxygen octahedra with a central Mn atom. The cubic perovskite structure is distorted into an orthorhombic structure by a strong Jahn‚ÄìTeller distortion of the oxygen octahedra. LaMnO3 often has lanthanum vacancies as evidenced by neutron scattering. For this reason, this material is usually referred as LaMnO3+·∫ü. These vacancies generate a structure with a rhombohedral unit cell in this perovskite. A temperatures below 140 K, this LaMnO3+·∫ü semiconductor exhibit a ferromagnetic order. Synthesis Lanthanum manganite can be prepared via solid-state reactions at high temperatures, using their oxides or carbonates. An alternative method is to use lanthanum nitrate and manganese nitrate as raw materials. The reaction occurs at high temperature after the solvents are vaporized. Lanthanum manganite alloys Lanthanum manganite is an electrical insulator and an A-type antiferromagnet. It is the parent compound of several important alloys, often termed rare-earth manganites or colossal magnetoresistance oxides. These families include lanthanum strontium manganite, lanthanum calcium manganite and others. In lanthanum manganite, both the La and the Mn are in the +3 oxidation state. Substitution of some of the La atoms by divalent atoms such as Sr or Ca induces a similar amount of tetravalent Mn4+ ions. Such substitution, or doping can induce various electronic effects, which form the basis of a rich and complex electron correlation phenomena that yield diverse electronic phase diagrams in these alloys.

Career Steinhausen made his debut in motorcycle racing in 1961. After a few incidents, in 1964 moved on to the sidecar class, driven also by his friendship with the four-time World Sidecar Champion Max Deubel. Deubel recognized Steinhausen's talent and gave him one of his sidecars. Having started with the sidecar powered by BMW in 1972 Steinhausen decided to use the engines of K√∂nig, four-cylinder two-stroke of powerboat origin. The new engines allowed the German to build a sidecar lower and with better aerodynamics. In that year the German also made his debut in the Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Championship, where he came tenth in partnership with Werner Kapp, achieving a best result of fourth place at the Austrian GP.racingmemo.free.fr/MOTO-GP-classements_72-SID.htm The following season Steinhausen was 6th in the World (alternating passengers, Karl Scheurer and Erich Schmitz), getting his first podium finish (third in the Sidecar TT). For the '74 season, the German made a new chassis with the specialist Dieter Busch. With the new sidecar Steinhausen won his first GP (one of Belgium) and was fourth in the World (alternating two passengers this year too: Scheurer and Josef Huber). The 1975 saw Steinhausen (paired with Huber) graduate to Champion of the World, thanks to three wins ( Austria, TT and Belgium). That '75 was also the first title for a two-stroke sidecar. In 1976 Steinhausen is reconfirmed champion (winning again the same three GP as the previous year) and the 500cc Sidecar TT. The '77 season saw Steinhausen favorite for the title, but he did not do it, for various engine problems. From the French GP Steinhausen changed to a new engine from Yamaha and a new passenger (Wolfgang Kalauch), which ended the season in 4th place with a win in Czechoslovakia. Remembered for the Belgian Grand Prix, where the German marked the lap record at 200.520 km/h.

It mainly serves local services to Travem√ºnde‚Äôs Baltic Sea beach, the Baltic Sea ferries and suburbs of L√ºbeck. Route Clock tower at Travem√ºnde Strand station designed by Fritz Klingholz The railway runs from L√ºbeck Hauptbahnhof (main station) to the north together with the L√ºbeck‚ÄìPuttgarden railway (Vogelfluglinie, \\"Bird Flight Line\\") and the Kiel‚ÄìL√ºbeck railway. Shortly before reaching Bad Schwartau station the line forks off to the east. A freight line branches off the Travem√ºnde line to L√ºbeck-D√§nischburg. The main line then reaches the newly built L√ºbeck-K√ºcknitz station. The line continues along the lower course of the Trave, until it reaches L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Skandinavienkai (Scandinavia Quay) station. This station was built near the quays of the ferries to Sweden and Finland because the older Travem√ºnde Hafen (harbour) station was too far away from the ferries. As part of the reorganisation and expansion of the Scandinavia Quay, the track was moved in 2005 and a new station was built. The line reaches L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Hafen station, which is adjacent to Ostpreu√üenkai (East Prussia Quay). There was formerly a branch to Brodten via Niendorf, parts of which are now used as a cycle and hiking trail. The end of the line is the terminal station of L√ºbeck- Travem√ºnde Strand station, which is located in the resort district.  History  Clock tower of Travem√ºnde Strand station Travem√ºnde Hafen station Former D√§nischburg station Former Bad Schwartaus Waldhalle station The line was opened on 1 August 1882 and extended from the present L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Hafen station to L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Strand (beach) station on 1 July 1898. The rapidly growing leisure services at Travem√ºnde required a new Strand station, which was built to the plans of Friedrich Klingholz in the Art Nouveau style and opened in 1911. It has a clock tower that is visible from the beach, which still shows the time of the next service to L√ºbeck Hauptbahnhof on a large display board. A three km-long branch line from L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Hafen to Niendorf on the Baltic Sea was opened in 1913 to improve access to this tourist spot. Until its nationalisation on 1 January 1938, when it became part of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the line was operated by the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company (L√ºbeck-B√ºchener Eisenbahn, LBE). The LBE, which already operated the line in the 1930s with high quality bi-level cars, also introduced the distinctive slogan \\"Hamburg, L√ºbeck, Travem√ºnde‚Äìfrom the sea of houses on the sea\\" (Aus dem H√§usermeer an die See). Before the Second World War, the line was administered by the Eisenbahndirektion (railway division headquarters) in Schwerin. Later Deutsche Bundesbahn took over operations. The route between L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Hafen and Niendorf was closed on 29 September 1974. Schwartau-Waldhalle was abandoned in the 1990s. In 2004, the halt of L√ºbeck- Travem√ºnde Skandinavienkai was established near the Scandinavia Quay for ferries to Sweden and Finland as the Travem√ºnde Hafen station, which was previously used for the ferry traffic was too far away. In 2006 and 2007, the extensive port facilities and commercial areas at Scandinavia Quay were extended for port-related operations and logistics companies. In this context, the line was moved several hundred metres westward for a length of a kilometre, so that it now runs alongside the Ivendorfer Landstra√üe (Ivendorf highway). After removing the former hilly landscape, a vast warehouse and industrial area was created between the quay and the new railway line. The new entrance building is located about 1 km south of the now-demolished old building. There is now only a southern access road to the entire port area. Thus, the new halt has no walking access to the Scandinavia Quay more. Passengers arriving by train must change to the bus to reach the ships. The redesigned historic Strand station reopened after extensive restoration work on 23 May 2006. During this work the formerly broken clock tower clock was also put back into operation. In 2007, work began on electrifying the line as a continuation of the electrification of the L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg railway. The electrification was completed in December 2008. Freight trains since then have been able to operate without having to change locomotives in the Hamburg area. In July 2010, the double-tracking of the section between Schwartau-Waldhalle and K√ºcknitz was put into operation requiring the rebuilding of four bridges. A new halt was opened in D√§nischburg with the name of L√ºbeck-D√§nischburg IKEA on 14 December 2014. The 1986 after the closure of the Villeroy & Boch factory, the abandoned halt was reactivated after the LUV-Center shopping centre was built on the former works site with 400.000 m¬≤ of retail space. The change of name is due to the fact that the IKEA furniture store in the shopping center had assumed almost the entire cost of the station with an investment of ‚Ç¨3 million.

They consisted of push‚Äìpull trains with control cars equipped with automatic Scharfenberg couplers and two units had a common Jacobs bogie. The eight streamlined express trains with double-deck carriages were purchased from Waggon- und Maschinenbau AG G√∂rlitz (WUMAG) and Linke- Hofmann. They were hauled by a fast, streamlined tender locomotive, which could be remotely controlled by the driver from the other end of the train. The LBE double-deck carriages offered great comfort for that time, such as padded seats in third class. Larger luggage was taken by porters on boarding and stowed in the luggage compartment and returned when its owner left the train. Deutsche Bundesbahn continued to operate push-pull trains particularly in the 1960s and 1970s for Regional services to Hamburg, which were hauled by class 220 locomotives. Local transport to L√ºbeck was operated for a long time with class 211 diesel locomotives with three-axle converted vans with express control cars of yl class. The section between L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Hafen and Niendorf stations was operated with Uerdingen railbuses from the 1950s to the closing and abandonment of the line. Passenger services were converted from diesel-haulage to electrical operation on 13‚Äì14 December 2008. Previously on summer weekends, trains were operated as push-pull trains with up to seven double-deck carriage hauled by class 218 diesel locomotives. In periods of low demand, especially in the winter, services were operated with diesel railcar of class 628. Following the electrification of the line, the diesel locomotives were replaced with class 112 locomotives. The freight is hauled with class 232 diesel locomotives. The line is currently (as of 2016) served every hour on weekdays with Regionalbahn services on line RB 86, running between L√ºbeck Hauptbahnhof and L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Strand and operated by Regionalbahn Schleswig-Holstein (a DB Regio brand) with Alstom Coradia LINT 41 (class 648) sets. In the summer season, on weekends, public holidays and during Travem√ºnde Week, loco-hauled Regional-Express services also run as line RE 8 from Hamburg Hauptbahnhof via L√ºbeck Hauptbahnhof to L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Strand.

It is also designated as the National Shrine of San Antonio de Padua (Filipino: Pambansang Dambana ng San Antonio de Padua) of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines on April 23, 2019. In 1606 the Franciscans set up the second printing press of the Philippines under the supervision of Tom√°s Pinp√≠n and Domingo Loag. Its titular is St. Anthony of Padua, whose feast is celebrated every June 13.  History  = Establishment of parish = The first missionaries in Pila were Augustinians who administered their missions from Bay. The Franciscans then started to evangelize the townsmen of Pila through Fray Ju√°n Portocarrero de Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa de San Jos√© (known as the Apostles of Laguna and Tayabas) in 1578. They started to established \\"Villa de Pila\\" and soon built a church out of cane, dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua. From being a reducci√≥n, Pila was elevated to a parish on the feast of its titular on June 13, 1581, with Fray Oropesa as its pastor (parish priest) until 1583. With its establishment, Pila became the first church dedicated to St. Anthony in the country. The Spanish colonial authorities gave the Pila the title, La Noble Villa de Pila. In 1599 permission was given by the Superior Gobiernoto build a stone church. In 1617 the stone church and rectory was finished in Pagalangan (place of reverence). = Printing press = The Franciscans established the second printing press in the Philippines in 1606. The first Tagalog dictionary Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala by local pastor Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura was printed here in 1613 by Tom√°s Pinp√≠n and Domingo Loag. The dictionary was used to facilitate the evangelization of the Tagalog region. = Infirmary at Pila = An infirmary run by male Franciscan religious from Lumban was transferred to Pila in 1618, and in 1673 transferred to the town of Santa Cruz. About 75 Franciscan missionaries retired and died at Pila's infirmary, and were buried at the local cemetery. These included Fray Miguel de Talavera (died 1622), a prolific writer in Tagalog, and Fray Bl√°s de la Madre de Di√≥s (died 1626), ex-provincial and author of the earliest Flora de Filipinas, Manila Archbishop Fernando Montero de Espinosa, newly arrived from Madrid, also died here in 1644 on his way to take possession of his see. = Ancient bell = The oldest surviving church bell of Pila was cast on the centenary of the parish in 1681 with the Franciscan emblem and the inscription ‚ÄúSan Antonio de Pila.‚Äù It survived British invaders in 1762 when the people of Pila submerged it in Laguna de Bay facing the church. It is now the third-oldest church bell in the Philippines. When a new stone belfry was built in 1890, the parish recast an undated old bell in honor of St. Anthony in 1893. Today, the oldest bell of Pila is at the church convent. = Transfer = Due to flooding in Pagalangan (today's Victoria), the church and rectory were demolished and transferred to their current site in Sta. Clara in 1800. The land where the Pila Church and Municipal Hall of Pila stands was donated by Felizardo Rivera, the recognized founder of Pila. The buildings were constructed under the direction of Fray Antonio de Argobejo and Fray Domingo de Valencia, the town contributing for it. Due to controversies surrounding the transfer of the church, the relocation took almost two decades to complete. = Secular priests = From 1812 to 1835 Filipino secular priests served as acting pastors of Pila due to a shortage of Franciscan priests. These include Fray Lorenzo Samaniego (1812‚Äì1816); Pedro de los Santos (1816‚Äì1819); Pedro Alc√°ntara (1819‚Äì1826); and Rudecindo Aquino (1826‚Äì1835). The present church and convent was built in 1849 by Fathers Antonio Argobejo and Domingo de Valencia. Both structure were badly damaged during the 1880 earthquake, in which the bell tower toppled. The bell tower was reconstructed by Father Damaso Bolanos and finished by Father Francisco de Santa Olalia, and again rebuilt by Father Lope Toledo. The present rectory or convent (casa parroquial) is made of stone, constructed under the direction of Father Benito del Quintanar in the 1840s. Fray Benito also started the Archicofrad√≠a del Nuestro Se√±or Padre San Francisco which was next in rank to the Venerable Orden Tercera (VOT) of the Franciscan Order. The religious festival of Flores de Mayo, for which Pila is now well known, was introduced in 1888 by Fray Benito de los Infantes. In 1855, plans for a concrete belfry were drawn by the local architect and builder, Maestro Sebasti√°n Bade and was built after the 1863 earthquake. = The 1896 Revolution and US occupation = The first monument of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Laguna can be found in Pila From being a calm town, Pila including the parish was rent asunder from 1896 during the Spanish revolution until the American occupation in 1902, where attempts of take over and reorganization of the government happened. American soldiers used the belfry and convent of Pila church for more than a year. At this time, church properties were destroyed and looted. The first monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the province of Laguna was inaugurated at the Pila Plaza during the town fiesta in 1922. = Twentieth century= During the second World War the town was not bombed, unlike neighboring towns Santa Cruz and Pagsanjan. The parish was transferred from the Archdiocese of Manila to the Diocese of Lip√° when the latter was erected in 1910, and finally, to the newly established Diocese of San Pablo in 1966. The Diocese of San Pablo dedicated the Parish church of Pila as the Diocesan Shrine of San Antonio de Padua on July 9, 2002. It was led by Francisco San Diego, DD, former Bishop of San Pablo in the presence of Ricardo Cardinal Vidal. Many devotees came from nearby places. The church was elevated to a national shrine in 2019 becoming the first church under the jurisdiction of the San Pablo Diocese to receive such status and the 25th shrine in the Philippines. The solemn declaration was led by Archbishop Romulo Valles, CBCP President.  Architectural features The church has a three-level facade with classical Doric columns. At the pediment is a niche reserved for St. Anthony. Windows of the choir loft can be seen at the second level while niches for the statues of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary are found at the lowest level. The semicircular arched doorway has the Franciscan seal on top. On the right side of the church is the convent, now used as a school building for Liceo de Pila, while a square based octagonal bell tower is on the left side.

He rose through the ranks of management at the company, eventually becoming the chairman of CBS Records UK in 1976. He promoted British acts such as The Clash, New Hearts and Adam and the Ants, and oversaw the successful international promotion of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds album. In the 1980s, acts that he promoted included Sade, Wham! and later George Michael. During his period at CBS, the company had 44 no.1 hits on the UK singles chart. He chaired the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) trade association between 1983 and 1985, and was a member of the Band Aid organising committee. In 1985 he threatened to leave Columbia and join its rival Polygram. Columbia boss Walter Yetnikoff retaliated by announcing Oberstein's retirement at a conference. However, later that year Oberstein became managing director of Polygram Music, responsible for the company's acquisition of the A&M; and Island catalogues, and ABBA's recordings. He was also appointed to a second two-year term as chairman of BPI in 1991. Oberstein was known for his forthright opinions and flamboyant eccentricities. He often brought one of his dogs to business meetings and awards ceremonies and would pretend to listen to its advice. He always wore a hat, sometimes bizarrely, and in disputes would place his hat on the table and leave the room, with the parting instruction to \\"talk to the hat\\". After his retirement he returned to the US in 1993, taking a post as \\"Professor of Pop\\" at the University of Miami. However, he remained an Anglophile, frequently returning to Britain.

Its only brick minaret is located in its southeastern corner. On the bottom part of the minaret, there is a kufic inscription made by embossed brick. On the inscription, it is mentioned the construction date of the minaret, which is 1074 AD. The minaret is the third oldest minaret in Iran, which has an inscription.' It is said to have been converted from a Zoroastrian fire temple that existed before the Arab conquest of Iran. In the book Merat ol-Boldan, it is written about the mosque as follows: ::::\\"The mosque, which is known in Kashan as Jameh mosque , has one mihrab with a right qibla and a mihrab with a wrong qibla. The founder of the mosque was Safie Khatun, Malik al-Ashtar's daughter.\\" The large old mihrab of the mosque like minaret seems to belongs to the Seljuq era. It has an exquisite stucco, on which there are verses from Quran about the virtue of Friday prayer. It seems that this large mihrab has been destroyed intentionally because of its false direction of qibla. Instead of this mihrab a smaller one has been built in the true direction of qibla during the reign of Tahmasp I. The plan of the mosque is simple. There is a howz in the courtyard in front of the iwan, which leads to the inner space of the dome and also two shabestans at grade of the courtyard and a winter shabestan below the surface of the courtyard.

In 1821, shortly after his wife died, he left Missouri for Texas with his father- in-law, William Kincheloe (1779‚Äì1835), aboard the schooner Only Son. They arrived on the Colorado River on June 19, 1822. Chriesman became a member of the Old Three Hundred after Stephen F. Austin succeeded his father, Moses Austin, as empresario. Becoming the first to plot the headright Spanish grants on February 10, 1823, he continued until Stephen F. Austin's death in 1836. He surveyed the Jack League, in what is now Fayette County, which was purchased in 1843 by the German immigration company Adelsverein as a slave plantation. It was named Nassau Plantation after the Duke of Nassau.James C. Kearney (2010). Nassau Plantation: The Evolution of a Texas-German Slave Plantation. Denton, Texas: University of North Texas Press. p. 272. Chriesman fought against Native Americans as captain of the colonial militia in 1824. A few years later, in 1826‚Äì1827, he served in the Fredonian Rebellion, European settlers' first attempt to secede from Mexico. He was elected as mayor of San Felipe, Texas in 1832. Later that year, he was an attendee of the Convention of 1832. In 1835, Chriesman lost the election as regidor of Washington-on-the- Brazos, Texas. A year later, he attended the Convention of 1836 in Washington- on-the-Brazos. In 1836, as he was moving East towards the Trinity River, he heard about the Battle of San Jacinto and decided to serve in the Texas Revolution. As a result, he enlisted as captain in the 2nd company of the 141st Infantry Regiment. Serving on a committee to help choose the new Republic of Texas seat of government in 1837, Chriesman proposed a site near Washington-on-the-Brazos at what is now Gay Hill in Washington County. He was willing to donate four Labors of land (approximately 700 acres) for the capital of the Republic of Texas. Austin was eventually chosen as the seat of government. In 1840, Chriesman was one of nine trustees who incorporated the Republic's first private institution of learning, the Union Academy in Washington-on-the-Brazos. He retired in Burleson County, Texas. Personal life and death Chriesman married Mary Kincheloe in 1818. She died in New Madrid, Missouri, in 1821. In 1825, he married Augusta Hope. He had eleven children.

His recent academic research centred on engineering of antibodies for application in health care, management of environmental pollution, and the derivation and use of novel combinatorial libraries. In early 2015, Bill was celebrated as a pioneering bio-entrepreneur by the University of Aberdeen during a two-day symposium at the Institute of Medical sciences. Bill lived in Carnoustie, Scotland, known as one of the most challenging golf course in the world where the Open Championship was held in 1999 and 2007. He played this golf course every week and was formerly a committee member of The Carnoustie Golf Club, established 1842. In 2013, he published the book 'Sons of Carnoustie', which followed from his research into former golfers of Carnoustie who are thought to have spread golf around the world, known as the 'Sons of Carnoustie'. His research identified 163 such golfers from Carnoustie and his book tells of their lives and experiences. He also published a book of poetry in 2005, \\"thoughts and memories\\". Background Bill studied biochemistry at the University of St Andrews, Scotland and then obtained his PhD at the University of Dundee in 1969. His first publication, 'The origin of life - A master molecule' was winner of the Endeavour Prize in 1968. At the time, it was not yet understood what were the 'minimal requirements' of the living cell and in this review, possible mechanisms for the origin of the primeval cell were discussed. Between 1969 and 1978 Bill was a lecturer in Biochemistry in Aberdeen University and then entered industry as Head of In Vitro Toxicology, Inveresk Research International (IRI Ltd.) 1978-80. He established and was Head of Biotechnology at IRI, 1980‚Äì86, was Research Director of Bioscot Ltd. 1986-87 and then became Professor of Genetics in Aberdeen University in 1987 where he remained until taking early retirement in 2003. Between 1980 and 1987 he also served as Technical Director of Investments in Biotechnology by Cogent Ltd, the Technology Transfer Investment Arm of Legal & General/Commercial Union Assurance companies. He was co-founder of one of the first and world leading antibody engineering companies, Scotgen Ltd., in 1987, its Managing Director 1987-92, and President and Chief Scientific Officer of Scotgen Biopharmaceutical Inc. until he resigned in 1994. Research Bill's research focused in health care and environmental management and the work involved tackling problems focusing on protein engineering. Combinatorial libraries were designed and used to select and evolve new proteins that would have higher affinity for their targets, improved stability and ease of production. The aims of the research were: \\"to provide novel binding proteins with affinities for their targets which are much higher than those provided by traditional monoclonals through the use of antibody phage display libraries and combinatorial libraries based upon novel scaffolds. to design antibody fragment configurations with improved solubility, thermal, proteolytic resistance, and stability in organic solvents and detergents. to provide methods for manufacture of antibody fragments on a scale, and at a cost acceptable for application in environmental management and as components of topical pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals or consumer goods.\\" =Development of antibodies for bubonic plague treatment= In 1999, Bill headed a research team from Aberdeen University to carry out research at Porton Down to develop antibodies for the treatment of bubonic plague. The work was reportedly commissioned by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency in response to fears that British forces could be attacked by countries which had been thought to have built up stockpiles of biological weapons. The research was revealed after concerns about the secrecy of work carried out by UK universities at Porton Down were raised by the Scottish National Party. =Antibody technologies in the management of pollution= As a result of pollution caused by harmful industrial chemicals, international legislation setting minimal levels of organic pollutants in potable and environmental waters and soil were introduced leading to the need for sensitive and cost effective methods for detection and routine monitoring. This research programme was sponsored by the U.K. Biological Sciences and Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC) for 7 years and focused on provision of antibody based reagents using herbicides such as atrazine, diuron, mecoprop and paraquat as prototypes. In 1999 it was shown that antibody fragments could offer the possibility of sensitive detection and efficient removal of organic pollutants from the environment. Initially the insolubility of anti-herbicide antibody fragments when expressed in E. coli had restricted this work, however work later carried out showed that disulfide linked scFvs, termed SCABS, had improved stability in a range of environments.Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 28,77,1998)Trends in Biotechnology, 17, 290-296,1999 Industry Bill Harris spent 9 years (1978‚Äì87) with Inveresk Research International, Edinburgh, Scotland, initially as Head of In Vitro Toxicology and then introduced and was Head of Biotechnology. IRI Ltd were a contract research organisation providing safety testing facilities for new chemicals. They later merged with the Charles River Laboratories in Edinburgh, before being acquired by Quotient Bioresearch Limited in 2009.http://www.quotientbioresearch.com/news/general/quotient-bioresearch- acquires-edinburgh-clinical-research-facility He managed contracts with US. NCI, NIOSH, US Army as well as many European and USA companies. This was the exciting era of environmental toxicology with predictive mutagenicity and carcinogenicity testing of thousands of chemicals in widespread use in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, chemical and food industries and a lot of time was spent visiting and advising companies on the impact of results on their businesses. A broad knowledge of procedures and legal requirements for safety assessment of new drugs during product development programmes was obtained at this time. During this period, Bill was also technical advisor for investments in biotechnology by Cogent Ltd. This pioneering investment group provided vital funding to projects at the stage between initial university research discovery and industrial product development. In 1987, Cogent Ltd acquired the monoclonal antibody manufacturing company, Bioscot Ltd where Bill then served as Research Director. During this time, he directed the expansion of the companies' business into provision of novel immunoassay technologies and products, and developed an ELISA based test for the environmental monitoring of Legionella pneumophila, marketed by Boots Microcheck. =SMART Awards= Between 1987 and 1990, Bill was awarded four UK Department of Trade and Industry \\" SMART\\" awards for projects related to diagnosis of susceptibility to heart disease, and rapid detection of microbial infection. In 1989 he was a semi-final winner of the Toshiba Year of Invention awards for a programme to remove alcohol from wine. He was co-inventor on 20 process and product patent applications. =Scotgen= Scotgen was established in 1987 with seedcorn finance from the Founders, an investment by Aberdeen University Research and Innovation Services, and the Scottish Development Agency. This raised around ¬£200,000 and with a small additional loan in 1989, was the only investment in the Company until 1993. The Company expanded its contract research business at a rate averaging around 20% per annum and in 1992 had a turnover of approximately $2.0 million with 30% net profit margins. Profit was used to develop own products and in 1991 the first Scotgen product, reshaped human antibodies for respiratory syncytial virus (fatal childhood infection), was licensed to Smith Kline Beecham. Anti-infective therapeutic products developed up to 1992 included those for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Varicella zoster (chicken pox/shingles), cytomegalovirus and rabies. The RSV product was licensed to Smith Kline Beecham in 1991 but was not pursued after completion of early phase II clinical trials. Four anti-cancer antibodies were developed in collaboration with Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research and Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research, New York.

The first performance at the Timi»ôoara Opera was on 27 April 1875, the inaugural concert being Aida by Giuseppe Verdi. On April 20, 1880 the building was devastated by a fire. The theatre went bankrupt and was bought by the authorities. Since investments were insufficient, individual funds were needed for reconstruction. The government offered \\"eternal\\" property for over twenty lodges, with the right of inheritance. Later, in agreement with the owners, these lodges were redeemed. The reconstruction, completed in 1882, kept the original Renaissance style of the fa√ßade. After a second fire, which took place in 1920, only the lateral wings remained intact. The reconstruction of the building began on July 15, 1923, by architect Duiliu Marcu. On December 20, 1989, during the Romanian Revolution, a crowd of 40,000 gathered in the open space in front of the opera house. Some managed to enter the building through the rear, and a succession of figures representing factories and ethnic groups delivered speeches from the balcony.

Biography Hadi Teherani was born in Tehran, Iran, and moved to Germany with his family when he was 6 years old. He did his school in Hamburg and continued his study in Architecture at Braunschweig University of Technology from 1977 to 1984. He taught from 1989 to 1991 at Aachen‚Äôs Technical University. He began his career as a fashion designer in Cologne before starting as a professional architect. He founded the architecture office BRT with his colleagues Bothe, Richter in 1991 additionally, he founded the design company under his own name, Hadi Teherani AG, in 2003 for his designing plans and ideas. He is a member of Hamburg‚Äôs Academy of the Arts (in German: Freien Akademie der K√ºnste Hamburg) since 1999. Hadi Teherani also runs his own business branches in Moscow, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Works and philosophy In order to achieve other sources of income and success, Hadi Teherani works not only as an architect but also in the area of product and interior design. Not only the architectural space is his goal, but the dense atmospheric, until all equipment details harmoniously designed, sensually perceivable space. In cooperation with various manufacturers Teherani furnishings, textile coverings or wall surfaces realized for its buildings due to his architectural language. The catalog of the designer Hadi Teherani ranges from office chair range (\\"Silver\\" / Inter chair 2004), more seating, sideboards, a mobile office module, lights, door and window fittings, various rug collections, wallpaper and sanitary objects down to the kitchen (+ ARTESIO / Poggenpohl 2010) and a bicycle (e-bike Teherani Hadi, 2011). One of the key factors in the success of Teherani, is the abundant use of glass in buildings and his designs. In the majority of his works we can see glasses as the main factor from the floor to ceiling, because he believes that three factors are very important in the structure: light, air and the view of the room. He tries by using the glass bring the building up to the highest standards. About the philosophy of his works he believes: ‚ÄúI was consistently confronted with the holistic challenge to exceed the boundaries of design. Architecture provides the basic foundation for a spatial idea. Only the complex implementation of a design idea from the smallest details, to the establishment of emotionally attuned space or the identities of entire companies, can solve the great task of realising a comprehensive design concept‚Ä¶‚Äù. Many products and projects of Hadi Teherani Design AG have been nominated and received numerous awards such as FIABCI Award, MIPIM Awards 2003, 2007 to 2009, 2014 LEAF Award, CityScape Award and ARX Award.
