With newer versions, additional inputs have been added or altered such that units like the 2010 Bop-It! Bounce shares no inputs in common with the original 1996. Bop It (see below). Bop It has been identified as some of the more popular children's games on the market,Szymanski, Marianne. \\"The Use of Focus Groups in Toy Testing \\", Advertising & Marketing to Children. Vol.1. No.2. Winthrop Publications. p.162. 25 May 1999. and toy and game development researchers have pointed to the natural interactions between player and toy, and the ability of players to use the toy to revert computer gaming processes back into those that resemble non-mediated object play. Other studies have shown that it is the Bop It's ability to mimic engagement in social behavior that has led to its commercial successes. Bop It has been released in many foreign languages since its re- release in 2008. With all models by KID Group, the team have managed to find voice actors to record the voice for the most popular languages in the world such as French, German, Italian, Latin American Spanish, European Spanish, Danish and Portuguese. There was also a Japanese version released. When the manufacturer access the hidden diagnostic test mode the English voice announces what version of Bop It the country is linked to. So if it is a Latin American Spanish Bop It from 2016, the English voice will say \\"Latin America 3\\". Since 2008, the voice of Bop It has been Buddy Rubino. Rubino has voiced all the modern Bop It games which include: Bop It!, Bop It! XT, Bop It! Smash, Bop It! Tetris, Bop It! Micro (original recordings from Bop It!), Bop It! New Moves and Bop It! Maker. He says in an interview with The Guardian that \\"he never heard of Bop It so when he knew that he booked the audition, he researched what the game was.\\" He also said that he enjoyed recording the remarks on which the game says when you lose. He also voiced a few mobile apps for Hasbro and some video games. Bop It has sold over 30 million units worldwide. Original Series (1996-2006) =Bop It= In 1996, the instructions to a handheld voice game called Bop It were copyrighted.Bop It! [Rules & Instructions]. Parker Bros. Available via Internet Archive. 1996. This game was the first of what was later to become a series of Bop It games relying on the same set of basic patents. The original game, called simply Bop It, features three inputs ‚Äî \\"Bop it!\\" (a depressible button), \\"Twist it!\\" (a twistable lever) and \\"Pull it!\\" (a pullable handle)Orbanes, Philip. The Game Makers: The Story of Parker Brothers From Tiddledy Winks to Trivial Pursuit. Harvard Business School Press. p.210. 2004. ‚Äî and three game modes: Solo Bop, Vox Bop and Beat Bop. Gameplay is predicated upon a player's efforts to match the commands issued by the Bop It in a timely manner by performing the task that is commanded. Thus if the Bop It is to call out \\"Bop it!\\", the player must quickly depress the \\"Bop It!\\" button. If the Bop It is to call out \\"Twist it!\\", the player must quickly turn the \\"Twist it!\\" crank. If the Bop It is to call out \\"Pull it!\\", the player must quickly pull the \\"Pull It!\\" handle. Players' scores are announced at the end of gameplay with a cypher in which different tones represent different point values and the maximum possible score is 100. In 2000, a second edition model was made which can score up to 200. In the 2000 release at the end sequence, each \\"Pull It!\\" whistle denotes 100 points, each ratchet denotes 10, and each drum denotes 1 point. If the player reaches 200 points, the game will just play the victory song. This style of score-reporting would later recur in later Bop It models, and the Zing It spin offZing It Instructions. Hasbro. 1999.BopIt Extreme Rules [& Instructions]. p1. Hasbro. 1998.BopIt Extreme Rules [& Instructions]. p2. Hasbro. 1998. (see below). The same cypher values were used for all subsequent Bop It cyphers. This device requires 3 AA batteries. =Bop It Extreme= The Bop It Extreme In 1998, Hasbro copyrighted its instructions for the Bop It Extreme, describing the underlying patents as \\"pending.\\" This game included the additional commands \\"Flick it!\\" (a green zigzag lever) and \\"Spin it!\\" (a red wheel) along with the original three from Bop It. The game featured 4 game modes (Vox Bop, Beat Bop, Vox Bop Solo and Beat Bop Solo), and the maximum score (reported via cypher) was increased to 250. As with the earlier Bop It model, special victory songs were unlocked upon completion. Thus, achieving a score of 100 or greater rewards the player with an additional victory song after the announcement of the score. On reaching 150 inputs, a different special victory celebration plays, and achievement of the maximum score would trigger a yet different special victory ending. This device requires 3 AA batteries. In 2003, this model was one of the top games in the market. =Bop It Extreme 2= The Bop It Extreme 2 Partially reliant on the original Bop It's 2000 patent, the Bop It Extreme 2 also relied on the newly issued 2001 patent describing the layout changes that had been adopted for use in the Bop It Extreme. With its instructions copyrighted in 2002, the layout of Hasbro's Bop It Extreme 2 was shown to be altered from that of Bop It Extreme. The shapes of several inputs were also altered. Volume controls were added, and the method of score reporting was changed to using plain English. In addition to the four modes featured in Bop It Extreme, a \\"One on One\\" mode was added.BopIt Extreme 2. Hasbro. 2002. Bop It Extreme 2 was awarded \\"Electronic Game of the Year 2005\\" in the UK. This device requires 3 AA batteries. Bop It Extreme 2 was made in black, white, and pink variants. The Bop it Extreme 2 like the Bop it Extreme has a maximum score of 250. Hasbro also released a German-speaking version with the name \\"Simon Challenge\\". =Bratz Bop It= As described in its instruction manual (copyright 2004), Hasbro's Bratz-themed Bop It game uses a layout like that of the earlier (3-input) Bop It format. The maximum score in Bratz Bop It had the same scoring as the original Bop It re-release with a victory song playing after the score cypher for scores of over 100 points. Bratz Bop It requires 3 AAA batteries to operate.Bratz Bop It Instructions. Hasbro. 2004. =Bop It Blast= In 2005, Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to Bop It Blast, describing it as covered under the original (3-input) Bop It patent and referencing other patents that were pending. The game was also developed by Tiger Electronics. This member of the series again increased the maximum score to a total of 500, and for the first time allowed different high scores for different modes rather than having one high score for all modes collectively. Minor vocal additions were implemented such as the announcement of the player's score at notable landmarks (each 100 points scored). In addition to the six modes from Bop It Extreme 2, a \\"Light Bop\\" mode was added. The game also had an optional female voice. The game can allow the player to select a male, female, or both voices calling the commands. The same victory song from the original Bop It was used to report the 500 highest score. The sound effects and backing beats from this version were used for the current release of Bop It's. This device requires 3 AA batteries to operate.Bop It Blast Game Instructions. Hasbro. 2005. =Bop It Download= In 2006, Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to Bop It Download, describing it as covered under the 5-input Bop It patent and referencing other patents that are pending. Tiger Electronics also developed the game. This member of the Bop It line has three game modes - Solo, Pass It and One-on-One and has 15 levels of difficulty. The maximum score is 1000 and this Bop It lets the player download a program on a Windows computer to download new content. The software was discontinued a few years later when Bop It Download was discontinued by Hasbro. The 'level up' sound was taken from this Bop It to be re-used in newer Bop It models such as the Bop It! and the Bop It! XT. Current versions (2009+) =Bop It!= In 2008, Hasbro secured the copyrights to the instructions for Bop It!. At the 2009 New York Toy Fair and at the London Toy Fair, Hasbro allowed attendees to try out Bop It!. Bop It! has a new optional input \\"Shout It\\", which requires a player to shout into the microphone. The Bop It! has three difficulty levels: \\"Novice\\", using only voice commands, \\"Expert\\", using a random mix of voice and sound commands, and \\"Master\\", calling out voice, sound, and color commands. If the player scores 100 points in either of the less difficult modes, the next most difficult mode is unlocked. Players that achieve a score of 100 points in \\"Master\\" mode are considered to have beaten the game. Hasbro also added a multi-player game called \\"Party\\" where all the Bop It commands are replaced with body parts like \\"foot\\", \\"hip\\", and \\"arm\\". Bop It! requires 3 AAA batteries to operate and when the game turns off it will say \\"I'm going to sleep\\". All future Bop It's made by KID Group feature this sound. =Bop-It! Bounce= After securing the copyrights to the instructions in 2009,Bop It! Bounce [Rules & Instructions]. Hasbro 2009. Hasbro made announcements regarding the newest member of the Bop It game line, entitled Bop-It! Bounce during the 2010 Hasbro Toy Fair. The toy was also developed by Big Monster Toys. This toy features a ball and a small hand-held trampoline. There are six games that may be played on Bop It! Bounce including three games that emphasize the speed or number of bounces and three games that emphasize the player's ability to control the height of the bounces. *Max Bounce - Players compete to achieve the greatest number of bounces in 30 seconds. *Infinite Bounce - Players compete to achieve the greatest number of bounces without a time limit. *Hang Time - Players compete to bounce the ball the highest. *Right Height - The player must listen to vocal cues from the Bop It! Bounce, calling for higher or lower bounces until the correct height is achieved when a chime sounds. *Little-Middle-Big - As with Right Height, the player must listen to vocal cues from the Bop It! Bounce calling for bounces of \\"big\\" height, \\"middle\\" height, or \\"little\\" height. *Free Form - The toy produces different tones as the ball bounces to different heights. =Bop It! XT= In 2010, the instructions for the Bop It! XT were copyrighted. The Bop It! XT is the fourth edition of Bop It Extreme with the same commands but adding a new command, \\"Shake It\\". Also, \\"Spin It\\" is now orange. The game was demonstrated at the London Toy Fair and was released in 2011. The Bop It! XT is based on the gameplay of the Bop It! and returns the \\"One on One\\" mode and adds the new Pro level. In order to beat Bop-It! XT, the player is given a set of three commands to remember and must perform them in order with a mix of voice, sound and color commands 100 times.Bop-It! XT [Rules & Instructions]. Hasbro. 2010. =Bop-It! Smash= In 2012, Hasbro introduced Bop-It! Smash at the New York Toy Fair. Bop-It! Smash features color-changing lights in a central area called \\"The Zone\\". Players score by \\"smashing\\" two Bop-It! buttons together when a zone light is either green or blue. Bop-It! Smash has 3 various game modes: Solo, Pass It and Multi-player. In Solo mode, the player scores five points for smashing a blue light and one point for smashing the green. If the player smashes the amber light, the voice will say \\"Yow!\\" (followed by a negative comment such as: \\"Try harder!\\") and a game life will be deducted. After 4 rounds, the level is completed and a Bonus Round will begin. The player can get 5 or more bonus points. The highest number of bonus points a player can score in the bonus round is 105 and the player can break the programming and score over 1000 with the voice not being able to announce the score at the end of the game. After the level 5 bonus round, the bonus round becomes twice as fast from level 6-10 making the game harder to score points. During a level (except bonus rounds) the player can earn a life back if they smash another blue light after smashing an amber. In the Pass It mode, the player has three attempts to try and smash a green or a blue. If they smash an orange light 3 times, then the game is over. In the Multi-player mode, up to 6 players can play. The winner is the last one surviving after all other players have lost all their lives. The current World Record for a full solo game is 1070 and has been the World Record since May 2015. This is achieved by scoring mostly 95, 90, 85 and 80 bonus points on the bonus rounds and getting all blue lights in each level. =Bop It! Tetris= In January 2013 The Tetris Company have announced that they have signed a deal with Hasbro to make some real life Tetris themed games with their brands. In August 2013, Hasbro launched a Jenga themed version of Tetris and a Bop It themed version of Tetris. It features a \\"Marathon\\" mode and additional modes based around different gameplay styles (Blast, Double Drop and Shuffle). A special Silver edition was also released in late 2013 only in the United States. In the Marathon mode, the player can take advantage of the bonus rounds to score over 800 points. The highest Marathon score ever achieved is 866 and is the current World Record for a full Marathon. The highest number of bonus points is 80 but it can only be done in 2 different bonus round patterns. =Bop It! Beats= In 2013, Hasbro released a game called Bop It! Beats which first appeared on Amazon in December 2013. Bop It! Beats has five game modes - Classic, Classic Party, DJ, DJ Party and Remix and has three difficulty levels ‚Äì Rookie, Expert and Lights Only. It also has five actions - Bop It, Spin It, Scratch It, Reverse, Repeat and Flip It. In the Classic mode, there are 4 rounds and each of the two has a different set of songs that the game switches between. The first two are Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj and Levels by Avicii. In the second and fourth round, there are two songs that Hasbro chose to use in the game. One of them is Smash Dance remix by DJ Steve Porter. The highest score in Classic is 263 and the highest score in the DJ mode is 147 if played in the Expert level in the DJ Party mode. The game also has a Remix mode on which you can play any action sound effect you want on the turntable of the game. This particular Bop It has a glitch on which if the player reaches a 6 command pattern in the DJ Expert and Lights Only mode, the game will make the player fail. However, this glitch does not happen in a foreign-language version like the Spanish or the French versions. =Bop It! Micro Series= The Bop It! Micro Series is a version of Bop It released in 2014 by Hasbro. It uses the three basic commands Bop It, Twist It and Pull It and it has two game modes - Solo and Pass It. The game also has three volume levels. The highest score in the Bop It! Micro is 100 and as the player scores closer to 100 the pitch of the gameplay will speed up. As Hasbro released it as a series of games - several character themed version of the Micro Bop It followed which include - Bop It R2D2, Bop It BB8, Bop It Groot and Bop It Minion. In Addition to these characters, Hasbro have released a Bop It Olaf and a Bop It Chewbacca in 2019. On June 23, 2020,Hasbro announced a new bop it Yoda based on the mandalorion tv show. It has a release date of October 2, 2020. It is a Walmart exclusive. =Bop It! New Moves (2016 Bop It - aka: Bop It! Refresh)= In 2015, Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to a new model of Bop It to be released in 2016 called Bop It! New Moves (a.k.a. Bop It Refresh or the Bop It 2016). In January 2016, a YouTube channel called KIdsToysTester released a video of a working prototype of the game. In February 2016 at the New York Toy Fair, Hasbro demonstrated Bop It New Moves. The game was released worldwide in June 2016. The game has 3 main actions ‚Äì Bop It, Twist It and Pull It and 10 actions that use a motion sensor. These actions include ‚Äì Whip It, Drink It, Selfie It, Comb It, Answer It, Saw It, Hammer It, Cradle It, Sing It and Golf It. The game has six modes ‚Äì Action, Action Pass It, Classic, Classic Pass It, Beat Bop and Beat Bop Pass It. The Action mode has a maximum score of 200 points and the Classic and Beat Bop mode has a maximum score of 100 points. The game is the first and only Bop It to have a motion detector that detects when to change the batteries. It will remind the player with a sad pitch changing voice saying \\"My batteries are running low.\\" when the batteries need changing. =Bop It! Maker= In 2017, Hasbro released the follow up to the Bop It! New Moves called Bop It! Maker. The game was first demonstrated at New York Toy Fair in 2017 and was released in July 2017. The Bop It! Maker has 10 slots available on where the player can record their custom moves for the game. The game has four new actions - Bop It, Roll It, Shout It and Squeeze It. The game has three modes - Solo, Party and Basic. In the Solo mode, the game uses the four moves and all the recorded moves. In the Party mode, the game plays like Solo but instead the \\"Pass It\\" command is issued. In the Basic mode, the voice says \\"Bop It to Start!\\" and plays a little faster than the Solo mode. Each mode can score up to 100 points. =Re-release versions= Bop It re-release (2000) and (2002) In July 2000, the first patent for Bop It was issued. This patent covers all subsequent Bop It models, and was cited in the instructions for the re-release of the original Bop It (instructions copyrighted in 2000). The newer version of the original toy increased its maximum score to 200.Bop It! [Rules & Instructions]. Hasbro 2000. In addition to the score-report cypher, the 2000 model made use of a special victory song that would play after the score if the player achieved a score of 100 points or greater. The use of victory songs associated with in-game point-plateaus would recur in later model Bop It games such as Bop It Extreme and Bratz Bop It. The Bop It 2002 version requires 3 AAA batteries whilst the Bop It 2000 version requires 3 AA batteries. =Bop It! Classic (Bop It Micro Re-release)= In 2019, Hasbro released a new version of Bop It called the Bop It Classic. The game was released in the US in July 2019 with a worldwide release expected in the Autumn of 2019. The game has four modes - Solo, Pass It, Beat Bop Solo and Beat Bop Pass It and has three actions - Bop It, Twist It and Pull It. The game's programming is based on the Bop It Micro but it game unit is bigger than the Micro and looks like a Bop It from 2009. The recording of \\"Beat Bop\\" was taken from the 2016 Bop It whilst all the other voices were from the Bop It! Micro Series. Each game mode has a maximum score of 100 points. Keychain, pen and caribiner versions Mini versions of several Bop It models have also been released throughout the duration of the series to be used as keychain carabiners and pens. Mini versions have been released for Bop It 1996 and 2002, Bop It Extreme, Bop It Extreme 2, Bop It!, and Bop It! XT. Game modes =Vox Bop (with voice commands)= \\"Vox Bop\\" is a multi-player game that serves as the primary game mode for the Bop It toy. A voice recording in the game machine calls out the commands randomly with a musical beat that increases in speed as the game progresses. The player must match the series of commands exactly and then the voice will call out \\"Pass It!\\" and the Bop It is passed to the next player. As the player passes the game to the next player, the game will play a short melody and then the intro beat will play again before the next command. A player is \\"out\\" of the game if the player performs the wrong action or if the player hesitates. This mode is also known as \\"Vox Bop Pass It\\" in Bop It Extreme 2, and then simply \\"Pass It\\" in Bop It Download, Bop It XT, and Bop It!. Vox Bop One on One \\"Vox Bop One on One\\" is available on Bop It Extreme 2, Bop It Blast, Bop It Download, and Bop It! XT, though in Download and XT it is simply \\"One on One\\". In this multi-player game, two players each take hold of the Bop It with the yellow player holding the \\"Twist It!\\" crank and the \\"Pull It!\\" knob, and the green player holding the \\"Flick It!\\" lever and the \\"Spin It!\\" wheel. The unit calls out a series of commands and each player is responsible for only his or her assigned inputs. When the unit finally calls \\"Bop It!\\" both players must try to hit the \\"Bop It!\\" button on the side bearing their color first. The unit will announce which player was faster by which colored side of the button was depressed first. The winning player earns a point. If either player misses a call he is \\"out\\" of the game. The final winner is the player who gets to five points first and does not miss any commands. =Beat Bop (with musical commands)= The \\"Beat Bop\\" mode follows a similar format as the \\"Vox Bop (with voice commands)\\" mode (above) and the rules are roughly equivalent. The game mode is called ‚ÄúLights Only‚Äù in Bop It Beats. The difference in \\"Beat Bop\\" mode is that the game uses sounds as commands instead of words. Thus: * \\"Bop It!\\" becomes the sound of a bass drum. * \\"Spin It!\\" becomes the sound of a wobbling wheel. * \\"Flick It!\\" becomes a \\"Boing!\\" sound. * \\"Pull It!\\" becomes the sound of a slide-whistle. * \\"Twist It!\\" becomes a cranking sound. * \\"Shout It!\\" becomes a DJ's scratching sound. * \\"Shake It!\\" becomes a cowbell sound. =Solo Bop= \\"Solo Bop\\" is the single-player mode for the original Bop It. This game is substantially similar to \\"Vox Bop (with voice commands)\\", except the \\"Pass It!\\" command is never issued. Instead, when the player misses a command, the game ends and the score is reported. This mode is also known as \\"Vox Bop Solo\\" in Bop It Extreme and Bop It Extreme 2, and simply \\"Solo\\" in \\"Bop It!\\" and Bop It XT!. Beat Bop Solo \\"Beat Bop Solo\\" is only available for Bop It Extreme and Bop It Extreme 2. This game is substantially similar to the \\"Beat Bop (with musical commands)\\" mode, except that the \\"Pass It!\\" command is never issued. Instead, when the player misses a command, the game ends and the score is reported. =Light Bop= The \\"Light Bop\\" mode is featured in Bop It Blast and Bop It Download. The player must respond when the light and the command match together. =Color Commands= In the Master level on Bop It! and Bop It! XT, color commands are issued. Color commands are also issued in the \\"Pro\\" mode on Bop It XT. *\\"Bop It\\" becomes the word \\"White\\" in Bop It! and \\"Black\\" in Bop It! XT *\\"Twist It\\" becomes the word \\"Yellow\\" *\\"Pull It\\" becomes the word \\"Blue\\" *\\"Shout It\\" becomes the word \\"Green\\" in Bop It! *\\"Flick It\\" becomes the word \\"Green\\" in Bop It! XT *\\"Spin It\\" becomes the word \\"Orange\\" *\\"Shake It\\" becomes the word \\"Purple\\" Software versions In 2009, EA Games released Hasbro Family Game Night 2, a sequel to the earlier-released collection of Hasbro boardgames and toys, Hasbro Family Game Night. Hasbro Family Game Night 2 was released for the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS and both versions featured Bop It as a playable simulation.Hasbro Family Game Night 2 Wii . IGN. Retrieved 2010-07-07 In 2011, EA Games released an app for the iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad. This app features several game modes, commands from the handheld games, X-Move bonuses and newer commands like \\"Brush It!\\", \\"Crank It!\\", \\"Squeeze It!\\", and \\"Poke It!\\". EA Games has also made Hasbro Family Game Night 4: The Game Show which features Bop It as a playable simulation. Chillingo made a Bop It Smash app for iOS. Sister products The popularity of the Bop It line encouraged Hasbro to release a number of sister products. =Zing It= Zing It is a yo-yo-style audio game that, like Bop It, issues commands with which the player must comply. Like the original Bop It, three commands may be issued: \\"Bop it!\\", requiring the player to press the depress- able purple button, \\"Zing it!\\", requiring the player to throw the yo-yo downward and jerk it back up to the hand again, and \\"Loop it!\\", requiring the player to perform the \\"round the world\\" yo-yo trick. Zing It features three modes: \\"Vox Bop\\" (as with Bop It products), \\"Beat Bop\\" (as with Bop It products), and \\"Vox Bop Challenge\\", where the game will test mental pelmanism by issuing rapid strings of commands which must be subsequently performed in the correct order. As with Bop It and Bop It Extreme, Zing It announces the score by musical cypher. Like the two Bop It Extreme games, Zing It has a maximum score of 250 and is announced by a horn, followed by a crowd clapping. =Top It= The Top It is a kendama-style audio game developed by Parker Bros. (under Hasbro) that also issues commands which a player must respond to with the appropriate action. Commands include \\"Top it!\\" (requiring the player to catch the ball in the red top cup), \\"Flop it!\\" (requiring the player to catch the ball in one of the purple side cups), and \\"Flip it!\\" (requiring the player to catch the ball in the purple side cup on the other side). The command structure has slightly fewer variations than any other Hasbro game, since the \\"Flip it!\\" command can only be issued if the \\"Flop it!\\" command directly precedes it.Top It Rules. Hasbro. 1999. =Torx= The Torx is an audio game developed by Big Monster Toys under Hasbro that was released in 2000. The game has two twistable circles and two bendable arms that can bend in different angles 90 degrees. The game has four modes - Follow My Command, Find My Shape, Torx Says and Pass Torx. In Follow my Command, the game plays like a Bop It but the commands can get more complex. First the voice will say \\"Twist me\\" but then it can command the player to \\"Twist me again\\" or to \\"Twist me back\\". If it says \\"Bend me\\" it can command the player to \\"Bend me back\\", \\"Bend the same side\\" or \\"Bend the other side\\". Every 15 points, the game will announce \\"Torx Challenge\\" and give the player a sequence of commands to memorize. The challenge mode is similar to the one in Top It and Zing It and the player must start the sequence after Torx says \\"Ready, go!\\". In Find My Shape, the game unit will tell the player how close they are to the shape that Torx wants to be. It will give out directions like \\"Cooler\\", \\"Hotter\\" and when the player is near Torx will say \\"On fire!\\" and a sound effect will play if they find the shape. If the player is not near the correct shape, Torx will say \\"Ice cold!\\", \\"Warm\\" or \\"Warmer\\". In Torx Says, the game will produce 2 different tones. With a normal pitched Torx unit, if the player hears an F note, they must follow the command. If they hear a B flat note they must not follow the command. The game is over if the player beats the game or fails to respond or hesitate. In game four, the game will player like Game 1 but instead after a certain sequence of commands, the player will hear \\"Pass Torx\\". The maximum score in each game mode is 240. =Groove It= Groove It is an audio game made by Hasbro whose instructions have been copyrighted in 2003. With similar game play to the Bop It games, Groove It employs photodetection technology to determine the player's hand position. As with Bop It games, Groove It issues voice commands, however in this case the commands are: \\"the scratch\\", \\"the slide\\", and \\"the zoom\\". The game is more tolerant of errors than the Bop It games, allowing as many as three missed commands in some modes. The game requires a score of 250 to win, has a maximum score of 300, and employs a ranking system.Groove It Play Guide. Hasbro. 2003. Super Click-It! In 1999, a clone to the Bop It line of games was made by MGA Entertainment under the name Super Click-It, and it was also made under the name Bonk It. It was sold in the UK by Marks and Spencer in 2003. The game unit has five actions which are Squish It (a double sided yellow button that is pressed), Zip It (a lever that can be pushed up and down), Twist It (an orange knob that looks similar to the Twist It knob from the Bop It Extreme), Blast It (a green fan that when the command is issued will work either by blowing or using one finger to make it work.) and Crack It (an object that is designed to pull backwards and then to normal position). The game has two game modes which are: One Player with Voice Commands (the voice will say: \\"One Player, Squish It!\\" when the player presses the Squish It button to select the game mode), One Player with Sound Commands (The voice will say \\"One Player\\" with a Squish It sound effect). There are also two two-player game modes which are Two Player Voice Commands and Two Player Sound Commands. The aim of the game is similar to Bop It where the game gives one command and the player has to obey and perform the action. The game has a maximum score of 100 points and on achieving the maximum score the player is celebrated with a fanfare. In the two-player game mode, the game can continue up to 200 points if one player has scored 100 first. In the two-player mode, the voice says \\"Switch\\" instead of \\"Pass It\\". Unlike Bop It, the game gives the player more time to respond to the command. The game doesn't have any screaming sounds when the player performs the wrong action or runs out of time, instead, cartoon sound effects are heard such as the wa wa wa wa melody or a slip up sound effect when a cartoon character slips over a banana skin.

It starts off the Jamuna near the northwestern tip of Tangail District. After that it divides into two branches: the north branch retains the name Dhaleshwari and merges with the other branch, the Kaliganga River at the southern part of Manikganj District. Finally the merged flow meets the Shitalakshya River near Narayanganj District. This combined flow goes southwards to merge into the Meghna River. Average depth of river is and maximum depth is . The Dhaleshwari is a branch of the Jamuna but probably used to be part of the main course of the Padma. The course of the Padma has changed considerably during the period 1600 to 2000 AD. It is difficult to trace accurately the various channels through which it has flowed. The probability is that it flowed past Rampur Boalia, through Chalan Beel, the Dhaleshwari and Buriganga rivers, past Dhaka into the Meghna estuary. In the 18th century, the lower course of the river flowed further south. About the middle of the 19th century the main volume of the channel flowed through this southern channel which came to be known as Kirtinasa. Gradually the Padma adopted its present course.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., History of Ancient Bengal, First published 1971, Reprint 2005, pp. 3-4, Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata, .

Van Gogh's own title for this composition was simply The Bedroom (French: La Chambre √† coucher). There are three authentic versions described in his letters, easily distinguishable from one another by the pictures on the wall to the right. The painting depicts van Gogh's bedroom at 2, Place Lamartine in Arles, Bouches- du-Rh√¥ne, France, known as the Yellow House. The door to the right opened on to the upper floor and the staircase; the door to the left was that of the guest room he held prepared for Gauguin; the window in the front wall looked on to Place Lamartine and its public gardens. This room was not rectangular but trapezoid with an obtuse angle in the left hand corner of the front wall and an acute angle at the right.Though the building was damaged in an air- raid, June 25, 1944, and laid down afterwards, floor plans by L√®on Ramser, an Arlesian architect, dating from the 1920s have survived and supply most of the essential information, see: Roland Dorn, \\"D√©coration\\": Vincent van Goghs Werkreihe f√ºr das Gelbe Haus in Arles, Georg Olms Verlag, Hildesheim, Z√ºrich & New York, 1990, plate XIX/XX First version Sketch from a letter to Gauguin Theoalt= Van Gogh started the first version during mid October 1888 while staying in Arles, and explained his aims and means to his brother Theo: :\\"This time it simply reproduces my bedroom; but colour must be abundant in this part, its simplification adding a rank of grandee to the style applied to the objects, getting to suggest a certain rest or dream. Well, I have thought that on watching the composition we stop thinking and imagining. I have painted the walls pale violet. The ground with checked material. The wooden bed and the chairs, yellow like fresh butter; the sheet and the pillows, lemon light green. The bedspread, scarlet coloured. The window, green. The washbasin, orangey; the tank, blue. The doors, lilac. And, that is all. There is not anything else in this room with closed shutters. The square pieces of furniture must express unswerving rest; also the portraits on the wall, the mirror, the bottle, and some costumes. The white colour has not been applied to the picture, so its frame will be white, aimed to get me even with the compulsory rest recommended for me. I have depicted no type of shade or shadow; I have only applied simple plain colours, like those in cr√™pes.\\" Van Gogh included sketches of the composition in this letter as well as in a letter to Gauguin, written slightly later. In the letter, van Gogh explained that the painting had come out of a sickness that left him bedridden for days. This version has on the wall to the right miniatures of van Gogh's portraits of his friends Eug√®ne Boch and Paul-Eug√®ne Milliet. The portrait of Eug√®ne Boch is called The Poet and the portrait of Paul Eug√®ne Milliet is called The Lover. Second version In April 1889, van Gogh sent the initial version to his brother regretting that it had been damaged by the flood of the Rh√¥ne while he was interned at the Old Hospital in Arles. Theo proposed to have it relined and sent back to him in order to copy it. This \\"repetition\\" in original scale (Van Gogh's term was \\"r√©petition\\") was executed in September 1889. Both paintings were then sent back to Theo. Second version, September 1889. Oil on canvas, 72 x 90 cm, none Third version In summer, 1889, Van Gogh finally decided to redo some of his \\"best\\" compositions in a smaller size (the term he used was r√©ductions) for his mother and his sister Wil, The Bedroom was among the subjects he chose. These r√©ductions, finished late in September 1889, are not exact copies. In The Bedroom, the miniature portrait to the left recalls van Gogh's Peasant of Zundert self-portrait. The one to the right cannot be linked convincingly to any existing painting by van Gogh.Third version, end September 1889. Oil on canvas, 57.5 x 74 cm, none Provenance * The first version never left the artist's estate. Since 1962, it has been in the possession of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, established by Vincent Willem van Gogh, the artist's nephew, and on permanent loan to the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam. * The second version has, since 1926, been the possession of the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection. * The third version, formerly in the possession of Van Gogh's sister Wil and later acquired by Prince Matsukata, entered the French national collections in 1959, following the French-Japanese peace settlement, and is on permanent display in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. * All three versions of the Bedroom were brought together for an exhibition entitled Van Gogh's Bedrooms at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2016.

Biography Peers, often referred to by his middle name \\"Ray\\" by close associates, was born in Stuart, Iowa in 1914Biography of General William R. Peers and raised in Covina, California. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles where he was president of the Sigma Pi fraternity chapter and was a member of the Bruins' football, wrestling, and rugby teams. He was also a member of Blue Key and a captain in the ROTC He graduated with a degree from the College of Education in 1937. He received a regular Army commission in 1938 after spending a year in the army at the Presidio. After receiving his commission, he was assigned to the First Infantry Regiment in Ft. Warren, Wyoming. At the time, the 1st Regiment was a test unit for new equipment, tactics, and organization. When the United States entered World War II, Peers was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). He joined Detachment 101, which carried out guerrilla operations against the Japanese in the China India Burma Theater. At first the unit's operations and training officer, he became the unit's commander when its colonel, Carl F. Eifler, was disabled by injuries in 1943. He held that position until 1945, when he became commander of all OSS operations in China south of the Yangtze River. In this capacity, he led a Nationalist Chinese parachute-commando unit into Nanking, securing the former Chinese capital from the Japanese and communist Chinese before the armistice. After World War II, Peers joined the CIA, establishing the agency's first training program. During the Korean War, he directed covert operations by Chinese Nationalist troops into the southern part of the People's Republic of China from secret bases in Burma. Upon his return from China, he attended the prestigious Army War College, and afterward held a series of intelligence and staff positions. With his Asian insurgency warfare expertise, it was inevitable that his career would prosper during the Vietnam War. At its beginning, Peers was the assistant deputy chief of staff for special operations. The next year, he became special assistant for counterinsurgency and special activities for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In January 1967, as a major general, he was named the 32nd commanding officer of the 4th Infantry Division (\\"The Ivy Division\\"). 14 months later, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and commanded the 50,000 American soldiers of the corps-level I Field Force, Vietnam.Association of I Field Force, IFFV Commanders Based in the Central Highlands, The I Field Force comprised some of the most aggressive American formations in Vietnam, including the 1st Cavalry Division, 101st Airborne Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Peers also coordinated the operations of four South Vietnamese and the two elite South Korean divisions sent as that country's contribution. Under his leadership, allied troops decisively defeated Viet Cong guerrillas and NVA regulars in the battles of Dak To in November 1967, and Duc Lap in August 1968. In 1969, Peers was ordered by General Westmoreland to investigate the My Lai Massacre, being selected because of his reputation for fairness and objectivity. In 1970 Peers issued a very thorough and critical report on the incident called the \\"Peers Commission.\\" Hugh Thompson who, along with his helicopter crew, were the only soldiers who attempted to stop the massacre, said of the Peers report: Peers died at the age of 69 on 6 April 1984, of a heart attack at Letterman Army Medical Center at the Presidio of San Francisco.New York Times obituary Books published *Peers, William R. and Dean Brelis.

Other names include hierba del vaso (Spanish) and cotx (Seri). Another Spanish name for it is incienso because the dried sap was burned by early Spanish missions in the New World as incense. Habitat E. farinosa can be found in a variety of habitats from dry, gravelly slopes to open, sandy washes up to . It requires a very sunny position in a deep very well-drained soil, and minimal winter frost. It does well in cultivation often being used for border, erosion control, ground cover and massing. Recently the plant has spread dramatically in areas not natural to its distribution in large part because Caltrans has begun to use it in hydroseeding. Description Brittlebush grows up to tall,Hogan, C. Michael (ed.) . Retrieved 1 April 2013. with fragrant leaves long, ovate to deltoid, and silvery tomentose. The capitula are 3.0‚Äì3.5cm in diameter, with orange-yellow ray florets and yellow or purple-brown disc florets. They are arranged in loose panicles above the leafy stems fruit 3‚Äì6mm and no pappus is visible. During dry seasons the plant goes drought deciduous, shedding all of its foliage, relying on the water stored in its thick stems. 3-Acetyl-6-methoxybenzaldehyde is found in the leaves of E. farinosa. =Varieties= Two varieties of E. farinosa are recognized by Flora of North America.Brittlebush, incienso, Encelia farinosa A.Gray ex Torrey *E. f. var. farinosa ‚Äì yellow disc florets *E. f. var. phenicodonta (Blake) I.M.Johnston ‚Äì purple-brown disc florets Varieties formerly included E. f. var. radians, now regarded as a separate species E. radians Brandegee. Uses Brittlebush has a long history of uses by indigenous and pioneer peoples. *Glue: The resin collected from the base of the plant, yellowish to brown, can be heated and used as a glue. The O'odham and Seri use it for hafting, to hold points on arrows and harpoons. *Sealer: A different sort of resin collected from the upper stems is more gummy and generally a clear yellow. The Seri use this to seal pottery vessels. *Incense: Early Spanish friars learned that the resin made a highly fragrant incense, akin to frankincense in odor. *Gum: The Sells area Tohono O'odham children use upper stem resin as a passable chewing gum. *Toothbrush: Oldtime cowboys used brittlebush stem as a fine toothbrush. *Medicinal: Seri use brittlebush to treat toothache; the bark is removed, the branch heated in ashes, and then placed in the mouth to \\"harden\\" a loose tooth. The Cahuilla used brittlebush to treat toothaches as well, and used it as a chest pain reliever by heating the gum and applying it to the chest. *Waterproofing: It has been used to waterproof containers. *Varnish: It has been melted then used as a varnish.

He was the son of an unnamed sister of his predecessor, Kaloyan and Kaloyan's brothers, Peter II and Ivan Asen I, who had restored the independent Bulgarian state. After Kaloyan died unexpectedly in October 1207, Boril married his widow, a Cuman princess and seized the throne. His cousin, Ivan Asen, fled from Bulgaria, enabling Boril to strengthen his position. His other kinsmen, Strez and Alexius Slav, refused to acknowledge him as the lawful monarch. Strez took possession of the land between the Struma and Vardar rivers with the support of Stefan Nemanjiƒá of Serbia. Alexius Slav secured his rule in the Rhodope Mountains with the assistance of Henry, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople. Boril launched unsuccessful military campaigns against the Latin Empire and the Kingdom of Thessalonica during the first years of his reign. He convoked the synod of the Bulgarian Church in early 1211. At the assembly, the bishops condemned the Bogomils for heresy. After an uprising broke out against him in Vidin between 1211 and 1214, he sought the assistance of Andrew II of Hungary, who sent reinforcements to suppress the rebellion. He made peace with the Latin Empire in late 1213 or early 1214. After Henry died in 1216 and Andrew II left Hungary for a crusade, Ivan Asen returned to Bulgaria. He captured and blinded Boril in Tarnovo in 1218.  Early life  Boril was the son of a sister of three emperors (or tsars) of restored Bulgarian Empire, Peter II, Ivan Asen I and Kaloyan. The etymology of his name is uncertain: it may be connected either to the Slavic verb boriti (\\"to fight\\"), or to the Turkic noun b√∂ri (\\"wolf\\"). Historian Alexandru Madgearu says most recorded variants of the name (Boril«î, Burile, Borilus, Burillus) suggest that \\"it was pronounced Boril«é, as in Romanian\\".  Reign  = Rise to the throne = Kaloyan died suddenly while besieging Thessaloniki in October 1207. Rumours began to spread claiming that he was killed by the patron saint of the besieged town, Demetrius. A version of these stories claims that the saint persuaded one Manastras to kill the tsar. The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Henry, stated in one of his letters that Boril \\"had imposed his will by violence and usurped the imperial name and insignia\\". Henri de Valenciennes (who continued the chronicle of Geoffrey of Villehardouin after 1207) likewise described Boril as a renegade who unlawfully seized the imperial crown. According to Madgearu, both reports suggest that Boril had his uncle murdered, most likely in cooperation with Kaloyan's wife. Historian John V. A. Fine, however, emphasises that \\"there is no evidence against Boril\\". Boril married Kaloyan's widow either to strengthen his claim to the throne, or to secure the Cumans' support. However, many noblemen (among them members of his family) always regarded him as an usurper. Ivan Asen's underage son of the same name soon fled to the Cumans and later to the \\"lands of the Russians\\"George Akropolites: The History (ch. 20.), p. 161. (that is to Halych or Kiev). Boril's brother, Strez, sought refuge in Serbia. Instead of extraditing him, Stefan Nemanjiƒá of Serbia granted him the fortress of Prosek. A third relative, Alexius Slav, took possession took possession of the region of the Rhodope Mountains, which surrounded his castle at Tsepina. = War with the Latins = Bulgaria under Boril (1207-1218) In the reign of Kaloyan, the Greek noblemen of eastern Thrace had risen up against the Bulgarian Empire, seeking assistance from the Latin Empire; this rebellion would continue against Boril, who left for Thrace to reconquer the region in May 1208. Boril left for Thrace to reconquer the region in May 1208. During his march, he seized parts of Alexius Slav's territory before stopping at Stara Zagora. The Latin Emperor personally led his army against Boril, forcing him to withdraw to Plovdiv. Although Boril's army outnumbered the Latin troops, Henry defeated him near the town on 8 July. The Latins captured Plovdiv and Alexius Slav voluntarily paid homage to Henry to secure his assistance against Boril. While Boril was waging war against the Latins, Stefan Nemanjiƒá invaded Macedonia and occupied the land between the Struma and Vardar rivers. He granted the occupied territories to Strez but left Serbian troops in the region to secure his loyalty. The Greeks of Serres in the Kingdom of Thessalonica sent envoys to Boril's commander in Melnik, seeking his assistance against the Latins in early 1209. Henry soon intervened and suppressed their revolt. Boril concluded an alliance with Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea, and Michael I Komnenos Doukas, the Greek ruler of Epirus, against the Latins. He also made peace with Strez who had turned against Nemanjiƒá. Boril convened a synod of the Church of his realm in Tarnovo in early 1211. The bishops confirmed the Orthodox confession adopted at the synod of Constantinople in 843 and condemned the Bogomils, ordering their persecution as heretics. The synod established the date of Easter in accordance with the Catholic calendar. Boril, who had presided over the synod, ordered the publication of its decisions in Bulgarian on 11 February 1211. Boril sent an army to a mountain pass to prepare an ambush for the Latin Emperor Henry who was returning from Thessaloniki to Constantinople in April 1211. Having been informed of Boril's plan, Henry gathered his troops from the nearby Latin fortresses and forced Boril to withdraw his army. Strez invaded the Kingdom of Thessalonica, but Michael of Epirus, who had made peace with the Latins, invaded his realm. Boril intervened in the conflict on Strez's behalf, but their united armies were defeated near Bitola in early summer. He launched an assault on Thessaloniki in October, but Eustace of Flanders, who administered the kingdom as regent, forced him to lift the siege. Alexius Slav intervened the conflict on Eustace's behalf and captured Melnik. = Uprising = John Fine says Boril held the Church synod to secure the support of the clergy for himself, because \\"popular dissatisfaction with his reign may still have existed\\" in 1211. An uprising which broke out in Vidin between 1211 and 1214 demonstrated the existence of popular discontent with him. The exact circumstances of the movement are uncertain, because the only source of information about these events are in fragmentary data preserved in a Hungarian royal charter issued in 1250. Boril was unable to suppress the rebellion without external assistance, turning to Andrew II of Hungary, reminding him of \\"their reliable friendship\\". Andrew dispatched Joachim, Count of Hermannstadt (now Sibiu in Romania), to Bulgaria at the head of an army of Saxon, Vlach, Sz√©kely and Pecheneg troops. Joachim first routed three Cuman chieftains who tried to halt his invasion, then captured Vidin and returned it to Boril. = Reconciliation = Seal of Henry of Flanders, Latin Emperor of Constantinople A papal legate (identified as Pelagius of Albano) came to Bulgaria in the summer of 1213. He continued his journey towards Constantinople, implying that his mediation contributed to the subsequent reconciliation between Boril and Henry. Boril desired peace because he had already realised that he would be unable to regain the Thracian territories lost to the Latin Empire; Henry wanted peace with Bulgaria in order to resume his war against Emperor Theodore I Laskaris. After lengthy negotiations, Henry married Boril's stepdaughter (whom modern historians wrongly call Maria) in late 1213 or early 1214. In early 1214, Boril offered the hand of his unnamed daughter to Andrew II of Hungary's son and heir, B√©la. Madgearu says he also renounced the lands that Andrew had claimed from Bulgaria (including Braniƒçevo). In an attempt to conquer new lands, Boril launched an invasion of Serbia, laying siege to Ni≈° in 1214, aided by troops sent by Henry. At the same time, Strez invaded Serbia from the south, although he was killed during his campaign. Boril was unable to seize Ni≈° however, due to conflicts between the Bulgarian and Latin troops. Conflicts between Boril and the Latin troops prevented them from capturing the town. = Fall = Boril was deprived of his two principal allies by 1217, as Latin Emperor Henry died in July 1216, and Andrew II left Hungary to lead a crusade to the Holy Land in 1217; this position of weakness enabled his cousin, Ivan Asen, to invade Bulgaria. Boril was beaten by Ivan Asen in battle, and forced to withdraw to Tarnovo, which Ivan's troops laid siege to. The Byzantine historian, George Akropolites, stated that the siege lasted \\"for seven years\\", however most modern historians believe that it was actually seven months. After Ivan Asen's troops seized the town in 1218, Boril attempted to flee, but was captured and blinded. No further information was recorded about Boril's fate.  Family  Akropolites described Boril's first wife (the widow of his uncle) as a \\"Scythian\\" (or Cuman). Boril's marriage to his uncle's widow violated canon law, but the Bulgarian Church did not protest against it. Baldwin of Avesnes, the Chronicle of Flanders and other Western European chronicles say that an unnamed niece of the Latin Emperor Henry (the daughter of his sister, Yolanda of Flanders, and Peter II of Courtenay) was given in marriage to \\"Johannis\\", who is associated with Boril. Historians who accept the reliability of this report say that Boril married Henry's niece after their peace treaty in 1213 or 1214. If this theory is valid, Boril's first wife either had died or had been sent to a monastery. Boril's daughter was engaged to the Hungarian crown prince, B√©la, in 1214, but the marriage never took place, due to Boril's deposition.

Through its operating subsidiary Cineplex Entertainment LP, Cineplex operates 165 theatres across Canada. The company operates theatres under numerous brands, including Cineplex Cinemas, Cineplex Odeon, SilverCity, Galaxy Cinemas, Cinema City, Famous Players, Scotiabank Theatres and Cineplex VIP Cinemas. Cineplex claims the heritage of Famous Players Film Corporation when it was founded in 1912, followed by the establishment of Odeon Theatres of Canada in 1941. Odeon merged with the Canadian Theatres chain in 1978, becoming Canadian Odeon Theatres.. Cineplex Corporation began operating in 1979. Odeon merged with Cineplex in 1984 to form Cineplex Odeon Corporation, before being acquired by Loews Theatres in 1998 becoming Loews Cineplex Entertainment. The present enterprise dates to 1999 when Ellis Jacob and a number of Cineplex Odeon executives formed Galaxy Entertainment Inc., which merged the Canadian unit of Loews Cineplex by Onex Corporation in 2002 following its bankruptcy in 2001. In 2005, Cineplex Galaxy acquired Famous Players from National Amusements effectively doubling its size. Since 2002, the company was owned by Onex Corporation, but it became publicly traded in 2011. On December 16, 2019, Cineplex agreed to be acquired by British exhibitor Cineworld Group for $2.8 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, but Cineworld abandoned the sale in June 2020 due to unspecified breaches of the sale terms. Cineplex also owns and operates multiple brands for entertainment (such as UltraAVX, Xscape Entertainment Centre, Player One Amusement Group) and restaurants (such as OutTakes and Poptopia). It is also a joint partner in the Scene loyalty program with Scotiabank. Cineplex Inc's current chief main competitors are Landmark Cinemas, Imagine Cinemas, Cin√©Starz, Cin√©mas Guzzo and Magic Lantern Cinemas. Etymology The name Cineplex comes from the word \\"cineplex\\", which combines \\"cinema\\" and \\"complex\\". It also defines a cinema as having multiple theatres. The circular rings stand for entertainment and unity in the logo, which represents a symmetrical graphic depiction of the ancient Greek amphitheatre or \\"odeon\\", the former name, which is Greek for the word \\"theatre.\\"http://mediafiles.cineplex.com/Logos/en/Cineplex_Brand_GuideMay2010.pdf The term was coined by Nat Taylor. Its former corporate name, Galaxy, comes from the words galaxye (Old English), galaxie (Old French), galaxie (Latin), Œ≥Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒæŒØŒ±œÇ/galaxias (Ancient Greek), and the Milky Way (milk). The logo consisted of the Milky Way; the apparent band of concentrated stars which appears in the night sky over earth. History =1912‚Äì1979: Predecessors= Cineplex stakes a partial claim to the history of the Famous Players Film Company (later Paramount Pictures), founded in 1912, as its earliest predecessor, though that company did not have any operations in Canada until 1920, when it bought Nathan Nathanson's Paramount Theatre chain, which Nathanson had established four years earlier.The Canadian \\"Paramount Theatre\\" chain was not affiliated with the American chain with the same name. Nathanson, along with being the 5th richest person in the world, became the first president of the resulting entity, Famous Player Canadian Corporation. In 1923, Famous Players bought out rival Allen Theatres, acquiring many buildings in the process. In 1979, Garth Drabinsky and Nat Taylor opened its first \\"Cineplex\\" theatre complex, in the Toronto Eaton Centre. =1999‚Äì2005: Early years= Galaxy Entertainment Inc. was established in 1999 by Ellis Jacob, a former Chief Operating Officer of Loews Cineplex Entertainment, and Stephen Brown, a former Cineplex Chief Financial Officer. With investments from Onex Corporation and Famous Players, the new company focused on smaller markets that were usually served by smaller theatres and old equipment, opening large, major chain-style locations under the Galaxy Cinemas banner. In 2001, Loews Cineplex Entertainment (a 1998 merger of Cineplex Odeon and Sony's Loews Theatres in 1998) underwent bankruptcy due to the economic recession of the early 2000s. In 2002, Onex Corporation, along with Oaktree Capital Management, acquired Loews Cineplex Entertainment. Onex retained Lowes Cineplex's Canadian operations on November 26, 2003 and merged them with Galaxy Entertainment, forming Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund. Jacob became the chief executive of Cineplex Galaxy Cinemas and Brown became the CFO. Most of the theatres acquired by Cineplex were once owned by Cineplex Odeon Corporation. =2005‚Äì2013: Purchase of Famous Players, Cineplex Entertainment= SilverCity Richmond Hill Cinemas On June 13, 2005, Cineplex Galaxy announced its acquisition of Famous Players from Viacom for $500 million (about US$397 million). This deal was completed on July 22, 2005. To satisfy antitrust concerns, on August 22, 2005 the group announced the sale of 27 locations in Ontario and western Canada to Empire Theatres. Eight days after Cineplex Galaxy announced its purchase of Famous Players Theatres, Loews Cineplex Theatres and AMC Theatres announced a merger. While AMC Theatres also operated in Canada and was ranked third behind Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund and the enlarged Empire Theatres, Cineplex Odeon and AMC Theatres remained competitors. In 2012, AMC sold four of its theatres to Cineplex Entertainment, in an effort to divest their Canadian operations and focus on their U.S. assets.Cineplex buys 4 AMC theatres in Canada, including Yonge-Dundas location  Toronto Star. Thestar.com (June 22, 2012). Retrieved on 2013-12-09. Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund, the owners of the chain, renamed Cineplex Galaxy LP to Cineplex Entertainment on October 3, 2005. In 2011, Cineplex Galaxy became Cineplex Inc. Cineplex Entertainment announced on March 31, 2006 that it had sold seven more theatres in Quebec to Chelsea-based Fortune Cinemas Inc. On June 29, 2007, Cineplex Entertainment announced its purchase of three Cinema City theatres in western Canada. Two theatres in Winnipeg and one in Edmonton were acquired. With the bankruptcy of Fortune Cinemas, Cineplex Entertainment acquired (or in this case, re-acquired) some of Fortune Cinemas theatres. The Starcit√© Gatineau (Starcit√© Hull) and the Cavendish theaters were reopened as Cineplex Entertainment theatres. In July 2012, Cineplex Entertainment purchased four of AMC's Canadian theaters, including the Yonge Dundas 24 at 10 Dundas East, adjacent to the Toronto Eaton Centre, and the Forum in Montreal. The purchase of the Yonge Dundas 24, presently Canada's largest multiplex cinema, brought Cineplex Entertainment full circle, as the original Cineplex at Eaton Centre was the namesake for the present company. The company also earlier acquired the Tinseltown Movies 12 theatre from another American chain, Cinemark, in the Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver. Over the subsequent years, Cineplex expanded into advertising, events programming and a new concept, The Rec Room, amusement venues with live entertainment that serve food and drink. =2013-2018: Expansion, VIP Cinemas= The Lansdowne location that Empire Theatres announced in 2011 was acquired by Cineplex in 2014 and opened in 2015. In the 2010s, Cineplex began to deploy a new concept, \\"VIP Cinemas\\", at selected locations, featuring premium amenities such as reclining seats, in-seat meal services, and a licensed lounge. On August 15, 2014, Cineplex opened a dedicated VIP Cinemas Don Mills location, the first to be devoted solely to the format. By 2017, the company had also begun to retrofit selected non-VIP auditoriums to feature reclining seating, as part of an effort to improve the customer experience. On June 27, 2013, the Empire Company announced that it would divest its Empire Theatres operations in order to focus on its real estate assets and grocery chain Sobeys. Cineplex acquired 26 former Empire locations, predominantly in Atlantic Canada (as well as two in Ontario), for around $200 million (Landmark Cinemas acquired the remainder, predominantly in Western Canada and Ontario). In February 2014, Cineplex announced that it had acquired Empire's planned Lansdowne Park location in Ottawa, and would construct a new 10-screen cinema at the site with three VIP screens. =2019-present: Attempted acquisition by Cineworld = Cineplex in Toronto Cineplex theatre in Markham On December 16, 2019, Cineplex announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by the British cinema operator Cineworld Group, the second-largest film exhibitor worldwide, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Cineworld would be paying $34 per-share‚Äîa 42% premium over Cineplex's share price prior to the announcement, valuing the company at CDN$2.8 billion. Cineworld planned to pay US$1.65 billion, and to fund the remainder by taking on debt. Combined with its ownership of the 564-location Regal Cinemas chain in the United States (which it had acquired the previous year), the sale would have made Cineworld the largest cinema chain in North America. Cineworld stated that it planned to integrate Cineplex's operations with those of Regal, while maintaining Cineplex's banners for its Canadian operations. The company also stated that it planned to reach $120 million in cost efficiencies and revenue synergies (including the adoption of a subscription service scheme similar to Regal and Cineworld) by the end of fiscal year 2020. The sale was approved by Cineplex shareholders in February 2020. Activist shareholder Bluebell Capital Partners called for the Canadian government to block the sale due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn led to the temporary closure of all Cineplex properties for several months starting on March 16. In May, Cineplex stated that Cineworld planned to complete the sale (pending federal approval under the Investment Canada Act) by June 2020, provided that it met the terms of the merger (including its debt not exceeding $725 million). On June 12, 2020, Cineworld abandoned the purchase, alleging that Cineplex had engaged in conduct that breached unspecified terms of the sale, and that the company had experienced a \\"material adverse effect\\" of an unspecified nature. Cineplex denied the claims and made counter-allegations. The agreement with Cineworld included a condition that the latter would pay a penalty in case it decided to cancel the deal. In July, Cineplex started legal action against Cineworld claiming financial damages and Cineworld counter-sued. Operations Automated ticket counters at Cineplex Cinemas Fairview Mall =Theatre chains= Cineplex's flagship banners include Cineplex Cinemas ( in Quebec), with some older locations still using the previous \\"Cineplex Odeon\\" branding, and Scotiabank Theatre. Selected banners originating from Famous Players are still used by some locations, such as Famous Players and SilverCity ( in Quebec), but these banners, as well as others (such as Coliseum and Colossus) have been largely replaced by Cineplex Cinemas (although in the case of Coliseum and Colossus, the unique architectural features of these theatres have been preserved), and Scotiabank Theatre in the case of Famous Players' Paramount cinemas. The Galaxy Theatres brand is primarily used by mid-market locations, although some have been converted to the mainline Cineplex brand. =Premium formats= Selected Cineplex locations offer premium screens and features for a higher ticket price, including large-screen formats, motion seats, and VIP. Following the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Cineplex reported that at least 80% of customers watched the film with one of its premium formats, and 40% of the company's overall box office revenue came from premium formats. * Prime Seats are reserved seating rows in selected auditoriums, near the middle of the audience. They were first piloted in Ontario in 2014, before receiving a wider roll-out. *The company currently operates 24 digital IMAX screens. Only one of these, Cineplex Cinemas Markham and VIP, was built by Cineplex rather than acquired from another theatre chain. The screen size is from about 73 to 119 feet, depending on the venue. As of July 2017, five Cineplex locations offer IMAX 70 mm film playback: both Scotiabank Theatre locations in Alberta, plus the Langley location (former Colossus) in Metro Vancouver, and the Mississauga and Vaughan locations (former Coliseum and Colossus, respectively) in the Greater Toronto Area. *UltraAVX auditoriums feature a larger \\"wall-to- wall\\" screen with 4K projectors, Dolby Atmos surround sound, and reserved seating. *D-Box seats are available at selected locations, which offer motion effects synchronized with the film. About a dozen locations offer D-Box on UltraAVX screens. *VIP Cinemas refer to screens featuring a premium, adult- oriented experience. They feature reserved seating, leather reclining seats with tables, a \\"VIP Lounge\\" area with a licensed bar, and in-seat meal services offering snacks and other premium menu options. Access to VIP Cinemas are restricted by the legal drinking age; depending on local laws, some locations also allow consumption of alcoholic beverages inside the auditorium (otherwise only allowing it to be consumed in the VIP Lounge). VIP Cinemas are offered at selected flagship locations, and Cineplex has also constructed several locations devoted exclusively to the format. * 4DX, a 4D film format, first launched at Cineplex Cinemas Yonge-Dundas on November 4, 2016. It debuted alongside the premiere of Doctor Strange as Canada's first cinema screen to feature the technology. 4DX includes stereoscopic 3D, as well as seat motion and other practical effects such as wind, strobes, and smell among others. A second 4DX screen opened at Scotiabank Theatre Chinook Centre Calgary in August 2019. * Clubhouse is an auditorium concept designed primarily for children, featuring family films, multi-colored seats and a play structure. =Arcades and amusement= Most Cineplex locations feature arcade areas under various brands. In June 2009, Cineplex began to deploy a new concept known as \\"Xscape Entertainment Centre\\", incorporating it into new locations or refurbishing existing locations to utilize the format. There are 28 locations as of September 30, 2017. Xscape feature both redemption games and traditional games, with some locations also including a licensed lounge and party rooms. They utilize card systems to store credits and points for prizes, and provide offers for Scene rewards users. About 77 other Cineplex locations continue to feature a \\"Cinescape\\" arcade, replacing the TechTown brand previously deployed by Famous Players and Playdium as well as the Zero Gravity brand launched by Galaxy prior to the 2003 merger with Loews Cineplex Canada. In 2017, Cineplex began to expand the Xscape brand internationally, beginning with two standalone Xscape arcades at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In January 2015, Cineplex announced a new entertainment restaurant chain known as The Rec Room. Comparable to the U.S.-based chain Dave & Buster's, The Rec Room features restaurant and bar areas, recreational game areas, simulators, and an auditorium equipped with a cinema-style screen. Cineplex CEO Ellis Jacob explained that the chain is meant to help the company diversify beyond its core cinema business in the wake of the growing streaming industry, The first location opened in South Edmonton Common in 2016. A second location in Toronto's Roundhouse Park opened in June 2017, along with a second Edmonton location at West Edmonton Mall. Cineplex aims to open 10-15 locations of The Rec Room nationally, ranging in size from 30,000 to 60,000 square feet. Further locations were announced for Brentwood Town Centre in Burnaby, Masonville Place in London, Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, Avalon Mall in St. Johns, Seasons of Tuxedo in Winnipeg, and Granville Street in Vancouver. Cineplex owns Playdium, a major arcade and family entertainment centre in Mississauga, Ontario. On October 2, 2017, Cineplex announced that it would re-launch the Playdium brand as a new entertainment restaurant chain oriented towards families; the first new location opened in Brampton, Ontario in 2019 (retrofitting the Cineplex Odeon Orion Gate theatre). In November 2019, Cineplex announced that it would introduce a new cinema banner known as Junxion. They are being positioned as a merger of The Rec Room's entertainment restaurant concept with that of a traditional cinema, with its first planned location to open at Erin Mills Town Centre in Mississauga in late 2020, followed by Kildonan Place in Winnipeg afterwards. Virtual reality D-Box VR theatre at Xscape in Scotiabank Theatre Ottawa In November 2017, an IMAX VR centre opened at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto, as IMAX VR's first location in Canada. The following month, a D-Box VR experience launched at the Ottawa location. The IMAX VR centre closed in 2019, as part of the discontinuation of the IMAX VR pilot project. In July 2018, after having opened such an attraction at The Rec Room at Roundhouse Park, Cineplex Entertainment announced that it had reached an agreement to be the exclusive Canadian franchisee of The Void ‚Äî a chain of mixed reality entertainment attractions. On September 13, 2018, Cineplex announced that it would acquire a stake in VRStudios‚Äîa Seattle-based provider of virtual reality installations, and utilize its equipment for as many as 40 VR centres across the country. =Scene= Launched in 2007, Scene is the entertainment rewards program jointly owned by Scotiabank and Cineplex Entertainment. Food and beverages Cineplex has an Outtakes () restaurant in 94 theatres, some which replace previous restaurant partners (Burger King, KFC and New York Fries) and others which introduce restaurants at locations which did not previously feature one. VIP Cinemas and some Xscape locations feature a licensed lounge with more premium offerings compared to Outtakes. Poptopia is a flavoured popcorn restaurant offered in a full-service format at 22 locations. Other Cineplex theatres may feature Poptopia at the concession stand, but only in the caramel corn and/or kettle corn flavours. Ice cream at Cineplex locations debuted with Baskin-Robbins and TCBY. Beginning in December 2007, Yogen Fr√ºz became the preferred partner.Yogen Fruz Goes to the Movies YogenFruz.com On January 1, 2014, Cineplex acquired a 50% stake in Yoyo's Yogurt Caf√©. As of January 2017, 77 Cineplex theatres feature Yoyo's restaurants, while Yogen Fruz is still available in 23 Cineplex theatres while TCBY is available in 16 locations. Cineplex also manages Melt Sweet Creations, an in-house dessert bouqtiue brand targeted at women ages 19-35 debuted in December 2017 at Cineplex Cinemas Queensway and VIP.https://www.cineplexcreative.com/#/melt-1/ Melt is available at 13 locations.https://www.cineplex.com/Theatres/FoodAndDrink/melt-sweet-creations Beverages are available in both cold and hot formats.

Select locations also offer premium drinks such as caff√® mocha or caramel macchiato. Tim Hortons is available as a full-service restaurant in five locations, with Brossard being the only location to offer both Tim Hortons and Starbucks. In most theatres, Cineplex offers sale of alcohol to 19+ guests in Ontario (18+ in Alberta) similar to the VIP theatres albeit from a selection of beer or cider beverages. Corporate governance The current Chief Executive Officer and President of Cineplex Entertainment is Ellis Jacob. Alongside with Jacob are Jordan Banks who serves as a Facebook executive, Robert Bruce, Joan Dea, Ian Greenberg, the founder of Astral Media, Sarabjit S. Marwah, Anthony Munk, Edward Sonshine, Christopher Medlock, Robert J. Steacy and Phyllis Yaffe, who serves as its chair.  Criticism and controversy  The Motley Fool described Cineplex as having a \\"virtual monopoly\\" over the cinema market in Canada. In 2012, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Cineplex over locations refusing to honour the company's \\"Cheap Tuesdays\\" promotion. The company agreed to a $7,000 settlement, including a $25,000 charitable donation. In 2019, the producers of Unplanned, an anti-abortion-themed film, criticized Cineplex for initially declining to pick up the film after securing a Canadian distributor. They felt it amounted to an effective \\"ban\\" of the film from Canada due to the company's scale. The film's co-director Cory Solomon also, along with other pro-life supporters and religious groups, called for a boycott of Cineplex. The company later announced that it would‚Äîjoining competitor Landmark Cinemas and a handful of independent cinemas‚Äîscreen Unplanned with a one-week limited release at 24 Cineplex locations. The decision was praised by pro-life supporters, but did lead to criticism from pro-choice groups due to disputes over the film's content (with the Alberta Pro-Choice Coalition stating that it planned to hold a peaceful protest outside Scotiabank Theatre Chinook Centre). The film itself had already attracted criticism from groups, such as the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, over its factual accuracy, with the Coalition describing it as \\"American propaganda\\". During the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, festival organizers stated that Cineplex would no longer allow films distributed by an online video service (such as Amazon Video or Netflix) to be screened at the Scotiabank Theatre Toronto (which has been considered the \\"primary\\" venue of the event for major screenings) due to company policy, as the services do not adhere to industry-standard theatrical windows. ScreenDaily stated that this was \\"believed to be the first time an exhibitor‚Äôs position on theatrical windowing has affected scheduling at a major film festival\\".

He was the son of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Anna Maria of Hungary. He was only seven when he succeeded his father in 1241. In the following years, the Mongols invaded Bulgaria and imposed a yearly tax on the country. He may have been poisoned, according to contemporaneous rumors about his death.  Early life  Kaliman was the son of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Anna Maria of Hungary. He was born in 1234. His mother died before 1237, when his widowed father married Irene Komnene Doukaina. Ivan Asen also died in the first half of 1241.  Reign  Kaliman was only seven when he succeeded his father. Although no primary sources provide information about the government of the country during the minor monarch's reign, Bulgaria was obviously ruled by one or more regents. Historian Alexandru Madgearu proposes that Ivan Asen's brother, Alexander, was most probably the sole regent for Kaliman; other scholars say a regency council was established under the leadership of Patriarch Joachim I. Bulgaria, the Latin Empire and the Empire of Nicaea signed a truce for two years shortly after Kaliman Asen's ascension. Two contemporaneous clergymen, Roger of Torre Maggiore and Thomas the Archdeacon, recorded that Kadan (a son of √ñg√∂dei, Great Khan of the Mongols) broke into Bulgaria in March 1242. Thomas also mentioned that Kadan and Batu Khan \\"resolved to hold a muster of their military forces\\"Archdeacon Thomas of Split: History of the Bishops of Salona and Split (ch. 39.), p. 303. in Bulgaria. More than 60 years later, Rashid-al-Din Hamadani also knew that \\"after much fighting\\" Kadan captured two towns in \\"Ulaqut\\"The Successors of Genghis Khan (ch. 1.), p. 71. (or Bulgaria). Archaeological evidence shows that at least a dozen Bulgarian fortresses (including Tarnovo, Preslav and Isaccea) were destroyed during the Mongol invasion. Although the country was not occupied, the Bulgarians were to pay a tribute to the Mongols thereafter. Pope Innocent IV convoked a synod at Lyon to establish a coalition against the Mongols in 1245. He also sent a letter to Kaliman, urging him to bring the Bulgarian Orthodox Church into a full communion with the Holy See and to send delegates to Lyon. Kaliman was only twelve when he died in August or September 1246. The contemporary Byzantine historian George Akropolites recorded that contradictory rumors spread about Kaliman's death. Some said that \\"he had succumbed to a natural illness\\"; others claimed that \\"he was killed by a draught secretly prepared to cause his death by those who were of contrary opinion to him\\".George Akropolites: The History (ch. 43.), p. 225. Patriarch Vissarion also died in September 1246. Madgearu says this coincidence implies that both were murdered by those who opposed the church union. According to a 14th-century charter, Kaliman Asan was the ruler of \\"Moldo-Wallachia\\" (or Moldavia), but the document is a late forgery. The northern border of Bulgaria did not expand over the Lower Danube. Honours Kaliman Island in Antarctica is named after Emperor Kaliman Asen I of Bulgaria.

Only two examples were built, but the work done on them later proved useful in the development of the Br√©guet 1050 Aliz√© anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Design and development The Vultur was a mixed-power design, combining an Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop in the nose with a Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet in the tail. It was a low-wing aircraft, with the wing featuring a swept leading edge and a straight trailing edge, folding at the middle. The aircraft had tricycle landing gear, with the main gear hinged in the wings just inside the wing fold and retracting towards the fuselage, the nose gear retracting backwards. The Vultur accommodated a pilot and copilot sitting side by side in a framed canopy. A typical payload was a single 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) bomb and eight rockets. It was fitted with radar in a pod on the right wingtip, balanced by a fuel tank on the left wingtip. A large search radar could also be attached under the fuselage. When the A√©ronavale lost interest in a turboprop attack aircraft, but was keen to purchase a new anti-submarine warfare platform, Br√©guet modified the second prototype as a demonstrator.

According to Aveling, the cause of the split was that Isabel could not abide his atheist views, although there were rumours that he had married her for her money. They did not divorce and the marriage ended with her death. From 1872 to 1876 Aveling was a teacher of elementary physics and botany at the North London Collegiate School for Girls. In 1880, Aveling delivered over a hundred freethought lectures and was made a vice-president of the National Secular Society. He edited the secular humanist magazine, The Freethinker when its founding editor George William Foote was imprisoned for blasphemy in 1883. =Political career= In November 1882 he was elected to represent Westminster on the London School Board. In 1884, Aveling became the boyfriend of Eleanor \\"Tussy\\" Marx, the daughter of Karl Marx, and thus was thrust into the inner circle of British socialism. Later in 1884, Aveling and Eleanor were both elected to the executive council of the Social Democratic Federation. This position proved temporary, because the couple separated from the SDF at the end of the year along with William Morris and Belfort Bax in the acrimonious split which formed the Socialist League. In 1884, Frederick Engels enlisted Aveling to help in translating the first volume of Karl Marx's book Das Kapital. Aveling also achieved some success as a playwright under the pen-name Alec Nelson. In the autumn of 1886, Aveling and Eleanor Marx toured the United States, lecturing on behalf of the Socialist Labor Party. After their return, they wrote a book for British readers detailing the situation of the left-wing political movement and trade unions in the US, which they said was populated by \\"unconscious socialists,\\" people who shared socialist values but disclaimed socialist ideas. Aveling and Marx wrote: > The mass of American Workers had scarcely any more conception of the meaning > of Socialism than had 'their betters.' They also had been grievously misled > by capitalist papers and capitalist economists and preachers. Hence it came > to pass that after most of our meetings we were met by Knights of Labour, > Central Labour Union men, and members of other working-class organisations, > who told us that they, entering the place antagonists to Socialism as they > fancied, had discovered that for a long time past they had been holding its > ideas.Edward Aveling and Eleanor Marx Aveling, The Working-Class Movement in > America. Enlarged Second Edition. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1891; pp. > 21‚Äì22. During his time in the Socialist League Aveling wrote and translated various socialist texts but nonetheless remained personally unpopular in the movement, the object of a steady steam of gossip and accusations. In August 1888, the branch to which Aveling and Marx belonged separated from the anarchist- dominated Socialist League in favour of an independent existence as the Bloomsbury Socialist Society. After leaving the Socialist League, Aveling became active in the Gasworkers' Union, for whom he served as an auditor.Henderson, \\"Edward Aveling,\\" pg. 37. Aveling was a founding member and was elected to the National Administrative Council of the Independent Labour Party by the 1893 Conference which established the organisation. He left that group to rejoin the Marxist Social Democratic Federation in 1896, despite his long-standing personal and political quarrel with SDF leader Henry Hyndman. = Playwright = Under the pen name Alec Nelson, Aveling wrote several successful plays,A History of English Drama 1660‚Äì1900: Late 19th Century Drama 1850‚Äì1900 by Allardyce Nicoll, p.246 including an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter that premiered in London in May 1888. By August, he was supervising the mounting of three different plays in New York, Chicago, and, in the words of Engels, \\"God knows where besides.\\"Friedrich Engels, Paul Lafargue, Laura Lafargue. Correspondence vol. 2: 1886‚Äì1890, translated by Yvonne Kapp. Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1960. p. 121, 140. = Writings on science = From his standpoint as a comparative anatomist Aveling easily accepted Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. As an atheist he eagerly promoted the division between some evolutionists and some Christians. His colourful writings on Darwinism were widely read by the general public. However, some of the arguments that he constructed himself were not widely accepted amongst the scientific community; he says, for example, that \\"the special creation of a species of animal or plant is not thinkable\\" because it would contravene the principle that both matter and energy are conserved.Aveling, Edward B, The Darwinian Theory, London: Progressive Publishing 1884: 26 =Later life, death, and legacy= In 1897, Aveling left Marx and on 8 June that year secretly married an actress, Eva Frye, using his pen-name Alec Nelson. He returned to Marx in September when he was suffering from kidney disease. After nursing him for some time, Eleanor Marx committed suicide mainly due to his infidelity. A coroner's inquest delivered a verdict of \\"suicide while in a state of temporary insanity,\\" clearing Aveling of criminal wrongdoing, but he was widely reviled throughout the socialist community as having caused Eleanor to take her life.Matthew Gwyther: Inside story: 7 Jew's Walk. In: The Daily Telegraph. 23 September 2000 It has even been suggested that Aveling might have murdered her.Wilson, A N, God's Funeral, London: John Murray 1999: 293‚Äì4. Aveling died four months later, on 2 August 1898, in Battersea of kidney disease. He was 48. His body was cremated at Woking Crematorium, Surrey, three days later. Despite his prominence as a member of the fledgling British Marxist movement, no representatives of the Socialist or labour movements were present at the funeral due to the widely held belief that he was responsible for Eleanor Marx's death. Aveling was also disliked by many of his contemporaries for his tendency to borrow money from everyone. A biographer of Eleanor wrote in 1976: > The truth is that in moral terms Aveling presented something akin to an > optical illusion: looked at in one light, he could be seen as feckless, > happy-go-lucky but fundamentally sound; in another, as an unmitigated > scoundrel. What, however, could not escape notice from any angle was his > infinite propensity to borrow money, which age could not wither nor ‚Äî more > surprisingly ‚Äî custom stale. He might be cheated...so that resigning from > the Secular Society he was loaded with debt. Yet this hardly accounts for > his habit of borrowing from the rich, the poor and the positively indigent > for trifling amounts ‚Äî though sometimes cleaning them out ‚Äî since he never > at any time ‚Äî and this in an age of ostentatious spenders... ‚Äî lived in a > style above that of any other middle-class socialist who had neither > business interests nor inherited wealth.  It is not uncommon to come > across individuals from whose company and a small sum of money one > simultaneously parts. This compulsion to borrow is not easy to explain in > those who are neither on their beam ends nor aspire to high living.\\"Yvonne > Kapp, Eleanor Marx: Volume Two. New York: Pantheon Books, 1976; pp. 205‚Äì206. Although he had numerous relationships with women, as far as is known, Aveling had no children.

The Championship was first held in 1993, and is sponsored by the National Geographic Society. Teams of three students plus one alternate are selected from among those who finished highest in their respective countries' national competitions (e.g. the National Geographic Bee in the U.S.A., the Olimp√≠ada Geogr√°fica Argentina in Argentina or the Australian Geography Competition in Australia). On the first day of competition, these teams take a written test on which all members confer and work together, then take part in a team geography skills-testing activity, such as using a map to find specified locations in unfamiliar surroundings. The scores from these two events are tallied, and the top three teams advance to the final round on the second day. The final round consists of questions primarily in the style of the National Geographic Bee, as a moderator (since 1993, Alex Trebek) reads questions to one team or one individual at a time. These questions may also involve the use of visual aids such as maps or photographs. Members of the top three teams receive bronze, silver, or gold medals for finishing third, second, or first, respectively. The National Geographic World Championship was initiated by the National Geographic Society in 1993. To be able to participate in the biennial competition (held every other year), a National Geographic approved organization in a country (the ‚ÄúCountry Sponsor‚Äù), working with the Ministry of Education in the country, must run its own annual nationwide geography competition which is open to most students under 16 years of age, based on school level, regional and/or national competitions. In the USA it is called ‚ÄúThe National Geographic Bee‚Äù. Other nations have different names for their competitions. Student team members must be 16 years of age or younger and not out of secondary school, at the time of the international competition. Each Country Sponsor is responsible for managing its own national competition, including compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. National Geographic has hosted nine international competitions to date. The medals are for recognition purposes and have no significant monetary value.  Rules and Regulations Each Country Sponsor can send a team of three (3) students and one adult escort to the National Geographic World Championship. As the event has grown, they must be firm with this number and cannot permit other students or adults to attend the activities associated with the event, other than the final part of the competition on the last day. The adult escort must be fluent in English, be knowledgeable on the subject of geography, and be associated with the national competition in their country. A student may not participate in more than one international competition. Students must be no older than 16 years of age at the time of the international competition.

He was the son of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Irene Komnene Doukaina. He succeeded his half-brother, Kaliman I Asen. His mother or other relative must have ruled Bulgaria during his minority. John III Doukas Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, and Michael II of Epirus invaded Bulgaria shortly after Michael's ascension. Vatatzes captured the Bulgarian fortresses along the river Vardar; Michael of Epirus took possession of western Macedonia. In alliance with the Republic of Ragusa, Michael II Asen broke into Serbia in 1254, but he could not occupy Serbian territories. After Vatatzes died, he reconquered most territories lost to Nicea, but Vatatzes's son and successor, Theodore II Laskaris, launched a successful counter-offensive, forcing Michael to sign a peace treaty. Shortly after the treaty, discontented boyars (noblemen) murdered Michael.  Early life  A monument to Michael's father, Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria Michael was the son of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Irene Komnene Doukaina. He was most probably born in 1239. His father, who died in the first half of 1241, was succeeded by Michael's seven-year-old half-brother, Kaliman. Kaliman died unexpectedly (possibly of poisoning, according to contemporaneous rumors) in August or September 1246.  Reign  = Territorial losses = Michael, who was only seven or eight, succeeded his half-brother. According to a scholarly theory, Michael's mother ruled Bulgaria during his minority, but she stayed in Thessaloniki just three months after his coronation. According to another theory, his brother-in-law, Sevastokrator Peter, assumed the regency for the minor tsar. John III Doukas Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, invaded Bulgaria soon after Kaliman's death. He captured Serres and seized Melnik with the support of the local inhabitants. He soon invaded the valley of the river Vardar, and occupied all fortresses in the region. Michael II Komnenos Doukas, ruler of Epirus, also broke into Bulgaria and occupied western Macedonia. The Bulgarians acknowledged Vatatzes's conquest in a peace treaty in late 1246 or in early 1247. The treaty also prescribed them to support Vatatzes against the Latin Empire of Constantinople. = New wars = B√©la IV of Hungary granted the Banate of Severin to the Knights Hospitaller on 2 June 1247. The charter of grant listed Bulgaria among the countries against which the Hospitallers were to provide military assistance, evidencing B√©la's plan to attack Bulgaria. Despite the tense relationship between Hungary and Bulgaria, Bulgarian troops assisted Vatatzes to invade the Thracian territories of the Latin Empire in August 1247. William of Rubruck, who visited the Mongol Empire between 1253 and 1255, listed Michael's realms (\\"BlakiaAssan's territoryand Little Bulgaria\\")The Mission of Friar William of Rubruck (1.5.), p. 66. among the countries paying tribute to the Mongols. Michael concluded an alliance with the Republic of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik in Croatia) against Stefan Uro≈° I, King of Serbia, in 1254. The treaty shows that Sevastokrator Peter ruled a large territory in Bulgaria almost independently of Michael. After Radoslav of Hum joined the coalition, Michael launched a campaign against Serbia, reaching as far as Bijelo Polje. According to a scholarly theory, a Hungarian attack against Bulgaria forced Michael to hastily return from Serbia. Vatatzes died on 4 November 1254. Taking advantage of the absence of significant Nicene forces, Michael broke into Macedonia and reconquered the lands lost to Vatatzes in 1246 or 1247. The Byzantine historian, George Akropolites, recorded that the Bulgarian-speaking local inhabitants supported Michael's invasion because they wanted to shake off the \\"yoke of those who spoke another language\\".George Akropolites: The History (ch. 54.), p. 283. To secure a peaceful relationship with Hungary, Michael married Anna of Macs√≥, who was the daughter of B√©la IV's daughter, Anna, and her husband, Rostislav Mikhailovich. A man and a woman depicted on an icon in the St Michael Church in Kastoria was wrongly associated with Michael and his wife (or mother). = Last years = Vatatzes's son and successor, Theodore II Laskaris, launched a counter- invasion in early 1255. When referring to the new war between Nicea and Bulgaria, Rubruck described Michael as \\"a mere lad whose power has been eroded\\"The Mission of Friar William of Rubruck (Epilogue 2.), p. 277. by the Mongols. Michael could not resist the invasion and the Nicene troops captured Stara Zagora. It was only the harsh weather that prevented Theodore's army from continuing the invasion. The Nicene troops resumed their attack in the spring and occupied most fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains. A rebellion at Melnik forced Theodore to march towards the town, but he managed to defeat the rioters before returning to Asia Minor for the winter. Michael broke into the European territory of the Empire of Nicea in the spring of 1256. He pillaged Thrace near Constantinople, but the Nicene army defeated his Cuman troops. He asked his father-in-law to mediate a reconciliation between Bulgaria and Nicea in June. Theodore agreed to sign a peace treaty only after Michael acknowledged the loss of the lands that he had claimed for Bulgaria. The treaty determined the upper course of the river Maritsa as the border between the two countries. The peace treaty outraged many boyars (noblemen) who decided to replace Michael with his cousin, Kaliman Asen. Kaliman and his allies attacked the Tsar who died from his wounds in late 1256 or early 1257.

Duchamp worked on the piece from 1915 to 1923, creating two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. Duchamp's ideas for the Glass began in 1913, and he made numerous notes and studies, as well as preliminary works for the piece. The notes reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and myth which describes the work. It is at first sight baffling in iconography and unclassifiable style. Yet this glass construction is not a discrete whole. The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even is also the title given to The Green Box notes (1934) as Duchamp intended the Large Glass to be accompanied by a book, in order to prevent purely visual responses to it.Tomkins, Calvin: Duchamp: A Biography, p. 297. The notes describe that his \\"hilarious picture\\" is intended to depict the erotic encounter between the \\"Bride\\", in the upper panel, and her nine \\"Bachelors\\" gathered timidly below in an abundance of mysterious mechanical apparatus in the lower panel.Cabannes, Pierre: Dialogues With Marcel Duchamp, p. 109. The Large Glass was exhibited in 1926 at the Brooklyn Museum before it was broken during transport and carefully repaired by Duchamp. It is now part of the permanent collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Duchamp sanctioned replicas of The Large Glass, the first in 1961 for an exhibition at Moderna Museet in Stockholm and another in 1966 for the Tate Gallery in London.Tomkins, Calvin: Duchamp: A Biography.The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even, Tate Collection The third replica is in Komaba Museum, University of Tokyo. Visual analysis The Large Glass consists of two glass panels, suspended vertically and measuring . The entire composition is shattered, but it rests sandwiched between two pieces of glass, set in a metal frame with a wooden base. The top rectangle of glass is known as the Bride's Domain; the bottom piece is the Bachelors' Apparatus. It consists of many geometric shapes melding together to create large mechanical objects, which seem to almost pop out from the glass and ever-changing background. All forms on the glass are outlined with lead wire and filled in with earth tone oil paint. The colors range from pale grey to gold to dark brown and black. Some figures are bumpy and cloudy, and contain the dust left on them during the time which the unfinished work lay dormant, which seems to be an attempt at capturing the dynamic passage of time in a sedate work. The Bride is a mechanical, almost insectile, group of monochrome shaded geometric forms located along the left-hand side of the glass. She is connected to her halo, a cloudy form stretching across the top. Its curvilinear outline and grey shading are starkly offset by the three undulating squares of unpainted glass evenly spaced over the central part of the composition. The Bride's solid, main rectangular form branches out into slender, tentacle-like projections. These include an inverted funnel capped by a half-moon shape, a series of shapes resembling a skull with two misplaced ears, and a long, proboscis-like extension stretching down almost as far as the horizon line between her domain and that of the bachelors. Her top-located domain is almost completely monochrome, with a wash of beige comparable to the cool colors of a cloudy sky. The Bachelors' earthbound, lower domain, referred to by Duchamp as \\"La Machine C√©libataire\\" (The Bachelor Machine), is a collection of much warmer, earthier colors of brown and golden tones. The Bachelors' Domain centers on the nine \\"Malic Molds\\". These dark brown shapes have a central vertical line, some with horizontal ones across them. They resemble the empty carcasses of clothes hanging from a clothesline, much more than they do actual men. They are interconnected through a spider web of thin lines, tying them to the seven conical cylinders. The cylinders range in color, and move in stages from nearly transparent on the left side, to translucent in the middle, to almost opaque on the far right. The opaque ones have swirling dark brown and gold colors and are almost solid three-dimensional forms, whereas the translucent ones are more ghostly outlines. They are connected in a line from tip to base and form a half circle. This rainbow-like shape is impaled centrally by a pole which connects them to the \\"chocolate grinder\\" at the lower part of the glass, and to the X-shaped rods that dominate the top center of the Bachelors' Domain. There is a chocolate grinder which consists of three drum-like structures, arranged in even spacing around a circular platform. They are appropriately chocolate brown in color, and are very textural, with a series of ridges running around their outside and spiraling out from the center. There are three tiny legs that barely seem to support the entire structure. The rods interconnect to form a large X, and look like they recede into space. One end is smooth and cylindrical, while the other tapers at the end and is capped with a sphere. The spherical ends are connected to two more rods that run vertically down to yet another machine. It is a contraption similar to a waterwheel with spokes of a bicycle wheel. This is tilted away from the viewer, almost to the point that it is indistinguishable. This in turn is placed on two elongated ovals, which are almost like runners. These support the wheel, along with the framework of a metal box that encases it and intersects with the Bachelors' \\"feet\\". On the right-hand side of the Bachelors' Domain are four faint, circular images. The top one is a perfect circle. A little below that are three circular images tilted away from the viewer. The first has twelve spokes, each spoke consisting of three lines. The middle is made of six concentric circles. The bottom is prickly-looking circle with a small hole in the middle, consisting of outward spiraling lines. The composition's most dominating feature is the series of spider web cracks, running diagonally from the top right to bottom left of the Bride's Domain, and in an almost figure eight from the top left to bottom right of the Bachelors' Domain forming flowery, flowing designs. Neither cracks nor paint disrupt the right, central plane, which is devoid of decoration, and around which the action of the art plays out. These occurred when the piece was being moved from its first exhibition, and after effecting the repair, Duchamp decided he admired the cracks: an element of chance that enhanced what he had done intentionally, following the flow of energy in the work's composition. The piece is placed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art gallery beside The Green Box, the selection of Duchamp's own notes on The Large Glass. It stands in front of a window, from which natural light creates a varying atmosphere depending on the time of day, the weather, and the season. It is also surrounded by his other works ‚Äì both paintings and \\"readymades\\" ‚Äì which form a background which the work otherwise is lacking. In this sense, this image of a frozen machine becomes extremely dynamic and engaging to the viewer. Duchamp's methods > I bought two plate-glass panes and started at the top, with the Bride.

Interpretation Duchamp's art does not lend itself to simple interpretations, and The Large Glass is no exception; the notes and diagrams he produced in association with the project ‚Äì ostensibly as a sort of guidebook ‚Äì complicate the piece by, for example, describing elements that were not included in the final version as though they nevertheless exist, and \\"explaining\\" the whole assembly in stream-of-consciousness prose thick with word play and jokes. Dubbed The Green Box, this 'explanatory work' has been described as \\"No less ambiguously or freely interpretable than [The Large Glass] itself...\\" Molderings, Herbert: \\"Duchamp and the Aesthetics of Chance\\". Columbia UP: 2010 (p. 8) Linda Dalrymple Henderson picks up on Duchamp's idea of inventing a \\"playful physics\\" and traces a quirky Victorian physics out of the notes and The Large Glass itself; numerous mathematical and philosophical systems have been read out of (or perhaps into) its structures.Henderson, Linda Dalymple: \\"Marcel Duchamp's The King and Queen Surrounded by Swift Nudes (1912) and the Invisible World of Electrons\\", Weber Studies quarterly journal, Winter 1997, Volume 14.1. Most critics, however, read the piece as an exploration of male and female desire as they complicate each other. One critic, for example, describes the basic layout as follows: \\"The Large Glass has been called a love machine, but it is actually a machine of suffering. Its upper and lower realms are separated from each other forever by a horizon designated as the 'bride's clothes'. The bride is hanging, perhaps from a rope, in an isolated cage, or crucified. The bachelors remain below, left only with the possibility of churning, agonized masturbation.\\"Mink, Janis: Marcel Duchamp, 1887‚Äì1968: Art as Anti-Art as reproduced at artchive.com. Gilles Deleuze expands upon this in Anti-Oedipus and claims it the last one of the Daniel Paul Schreber's stages, as the celibate machine. The celibate machine consists of auto-erotic consummation and it only produces intensive qualities. The desiring machine allies with the body without organs in this process.

Established in 1916, the school enrolled approximately 730 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 10 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and 32 percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is David Deitz. Overview Established in 1916, the school is situated in central Wollongong and caters for students from Year 7 to Year 12. Its close proximity to the beach, Wollongong CBD, the University of Wollongong, the Illawarra Institute of Technology, Wollongong Entertainment Centre, Illawarra Performing Arts Centre and Beaton Park sporting complex allows it to provide a balanced curriculum in terms of academic pursuits, cultural and sporting experiences. The curriculum is supplemented by relevant excursions and extra- curricular activities which include camps and national competitions of an academic nature. Students are expected to participate in sport and are encouraged to pursue their strengths in all fields of endeavour. Students who choose to attend the school do so from an area which stretches from the southern suburbs of Sydney to in the south. All students are encouraged to become independent learners; make choices concerning their own learning paths; and to extend themselves through involvement in extra-curricular activities. The application and testing process for students seeking enrolment into Year 7 at Selective Schools in NSW is centrally administered by the High Performing Students Unit of the New South Wales Department of Education. Applications for Year 7 are made in Year 5 with testing undertaken in Year 6. Applications open in mid-October and close in mid-November. Application Forms are available from local primary schools or can be downloaded from the High Performing Students Unit website when applications open. Students seeking a place at the school after Semester 1 in Year 7 make an application directly to the school. Each selective school administers its own application and selection processes for Years 8 ‚Äì 12. Application packages are available from late June and need to be submitted by late July. Further information and application forms are also available from the High Performing Students Unit website. History In 1906, Wollongong Primary School began to offered vocational education courses for non-academic students. This included courses such as Household Accounts, Cookery, Laundry and Dressmaking. Five years later, in 1911, secondary courses were offered to academic students which allowed students to achieve the Intermediate Certificate and with further study, the Leaving Certificate. A separate school for these courses was then established in 1916 under the name Wollongong Home Science School. This school was a single-sex education school for girls only and was based on a site in Smith Street, Wollongong. In 1957, the school relocated to its current location on the former site of Wollongong High School in Gipps Street and then in 1958, was renamed as Smith's Hill Girls High School. The school then allowed non-academic students to achieve the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates. During the 1970s, plans were underway to change the school into a comprehensive, co-educational High School and in 1979 the school was renamed Smith's Hill High School. In 1985, boys were enrolled in Years 7, 8, 9 and 11 drawing from feeder schools at Wollongong, Coniston and Mount St Thomas. By 1986, SHHS was completely co- educational from Years 7 through 12. Then in 1988, the NSW Department of Education decided to make the school a selective high school and from 1989 the annual Year 7 intake of students was to be filled through exam selections. The school has remained completely selective ever since. Higher School Certificate Students of Smith's Hill High School have consistently performed well in the NSW Higher School Certificate examinations, with the school placing 38th in the state in 2010 and having fifteen students make the All- round Achievers List. As a result of strong HSC performances, a high percentage of students from Smith's Hill High gain university entrance each year. This tradition of success has been in the school for many years. Smith's Hill offers a diverse range of subjects for both seniors and juniors in a number of key learning areas. For senior subjects which are unable to be offered due to lack of numbers, students are assisted to complete these subjects through distance education, in association with an appropriate distance education school. Extracurricular activities = Rock Eisteddfod Challenge = For many years, Smith's Hill High School participated in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. The school was in the Grand Final every year from 2004 and was a regular Grand Final contender in years previous. Due to the preparation time required, and the high level of physical activity involved, the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge performance was worked on during weekly sport activities. Smith's Hill High School participated in two divisions of Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, the RAW Division for Years 8 through 10, and the Premier Division for Years 11 and 12. Unlike other schools, students were not required to audition and positions are filled with preference given to students based on their grade. Also, Smith's Hill was one of the few schools that offered Year 7 students an opportunity to compete, with the most recent Year 7 RAW production being 'Nelson Mandela: Son of Africa' in 2011, which came fifth in the state finals in Sydney. There were a number of teachers involved at Smith's Hill who were also part of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. In 2006, the Premier Division team performed \\"Tibet: Roof of the World\\". The storyline included \\"Tibetan monks paying their last respects to the previous Dalai Lama, as well as the 1949 Chinese invasion and the exile of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.\\" After this performance, the team were granted a private audience with the Dalai Lama who asked the students to \\"continue to spread his message of peace, spirituality and protection of the environment to others throughout the state.\\" =Tournament of Minds= Smith's Hill regularly submits teams to participate in the Tournament of Minds competition. The school has had several successes in the competition with the 1998 team being state finalists, the 2002 and 2003 teams being national finalists and the 2005, 2018, 2019 x2 teams winning the national final. In 2008, for the first time two teams were entered in the competition which resulted in the Social Sciences team placing second in New South Wales and the Language Literature team gaining second place at the Australasian Finals in Melbourne. In 2010, the Applied Technology team succeeded in becoming national finalists and in 2012 the Maths and Engineering team scored tournament honours in the Australasian Finals in Perth.. In 2013, the Language Literature team again placed second at the Australasian Finals in Canberra. In 2015, a Language literature team also made it to the Australasian Pacific Finals in Sydney and gained tournament honours. In 2017, a Language literature team once again made it to the Australasian Pacific Finals in Adelaide and placed 2nd with tournament honours. In 2018, the Tournament of Minds Language / Literature team won internationals, the biggest win the school had experienced.https://smithshill-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/news/2018/10/principal-s- message---29-october-2018.html In 2019 this was surpassed with two teams - Social Sciences and STEM - winning internationals at Hobart after winning the state tournament in 2019.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvq3MI9GcNwjTariupzhAfXz6GrXazMn/view https://www.school-news.com.au/news/mind-blowing-results-for-our-schools/ =School productions= Smith's Hill High School has a history in performing school productions such as musicals and plays. In 2001, Smith's Hill High School produced its first musical in recent history, performing Little Shop of Horrors. Since then, school productions have been staged regularly including performances of Oklahoma! and compilations of various other musicals. In 2015, the school staged an outstanding production of Guys and Dolls. In 2006, the production team of Ribbit Up Productions was formed by drama teacher Bryan Cutler and has since performed at least one original show per year including \\"The Little Country That Could\\", \\"How to Host a Murder\\", \\"The Big Box\\" and \\"Overbelly\\". A junior offshoot of the company was formed soon after known as Tadpole Productions which has performed shows such as \\"Earthwatch\\", \\"Noughts and Crosses\\", \\"When Books Go Bump in the Night\\", \\"Personal Space\\", \\"Escape From RealiTV\\" and most recently, \\"Earthwatch 2.0\\", a remake of the original with a brand new cast. In 2011, the company differed from its annual performance of an original play and instead performed an adaptation of Hamlet. In 2012 they performed \\"The Magic Mountain\\", and in 2013 \\"Macguffin\\". Returning again to Shakespeare in 2014, \\"Whatever you Will\\", a pastiche of Shakespeare's comedies, was performed. More recent names to Cutler's record include; \\"Beethoven's Summer\\" performed in 2015, which followed Cutler's personal recollections of his childhood and growing up in Australia, and in 2016, \\"221a\\" was performed which honoured the BBC's Sherlock (TV series). In 2017, Cutler returned to political satire in \\"You Can't Have One Without the Other\\" followed by an adaption of Shakespeare's Richard III in 2018, which saw widespread acclaim. Due to the cancellation of Rock Eisteddfod Challenge in 2010, the Smith's Hill music department offered the opportunity to students to participate in a production of the musical The Pajama Game. Performed in July 2010, the production placed second in the Arcadian Theatre Group's School Musical Theatre competition which involved judging of school musicals in the Illawarra. In 2013, the music department produced another musical, this time performing \\"Anything Goes\\". Several years later, in 2015, the school also did a production of the critically acclaimed musical \\"Guys and Dolls\\". =Mooting= Since 2008 Smith's Hill High School has entered into the High School Mooting Competition of Bond University to promote and encourage Legal Studies students within the school. The school has achieved much success in the competition achieving second at the National Finals in 2009 and reaching the National Finals in 2011. =Debating= Smiths Hill High School has reached the NSW semi-finals for the Premier's Debating Challenge since 2007, winning the competition on five occasions, most recently in 2019. The representative NSW Combined High Schools debating team has also included Smith's Hill students over the last several years. In recent years they won the Hume Barbour Trophy. =Chess team= For many years Smith's Hill High School has had a chess team to be envied by rivals. For numerous years they have been decimating any opponent within sight, however the main period of dominance occurred between 2008 and 2013. These glory years for the Smith's Hill Chess Team can mostly be attributed to one player; one player whose very name when mentioned near a chess board makes a Chess player feel afraid. The name of this chess player, none other than James Brodnik. He has been known to strike opponents down within 4 moves and make them wish they had had the brain and strategic qualities of him. For 6 years, Brodnik lead the Smith's Hill team with such courage and conviction that State Title became a common occurrence. While Smith's Hill remains dominant to this day, the glory years under Brodnik's command will never be forgotten. =Ensembles= Smith's Hill also has a variety of music groups and ensembles. Each practice regularly and perform at special events, such as formal assemblies and open days including the School Expo, Presentation Nights and the 50th Birthday Open Day. At the end of the year, participating students get the opportunity to spend two days busking in Sydney. The music ensembles include: String Ensemble This ensemble is for students who play violin, viola, double bass and cello, accompanied by a piano player. The ensemble usually plays arrangements of the classical genre, and is instructed by a professional tutor. Recently many folk, recent and more up-beat popular tunes have been played, such as compositions by Coldplay and Lady Gaga. It is available for anyone in the school who plays one of the instruments at a solid level. The String Ensemble has played at eisteddfods, weddings and a number of other functions across the Illawarra. Concert Band This band is for students who can play brass or woodwind instruments, as well as percussion and instruments in the rhythm section. Vocal Ensemble The Vocal Ensemble is for any student who has an interest in singing. Smith's Hill's most accredited musical piece was their rendition of Beyonce's \\"Halo\\", performed angelically by an aspiring historian in 2017. Open to all students of sc is willing to participate in practices after school. This ensemble is great fun and all students learn about harmony and create beautiful harmony with each other. Chorale Group The Chorale Group is a cappella group and entrance is by invitation only. Junior Jazz Ensemble This ensemble is for students in Years 7‚Äì10 who have an interest in Jazz and can play an instrument suitable to the Jazz genre. Jazz Band Formerly known as the Stage Band, the Senior Jazz Band is a small performance group made up of experienced student musicians, and is designed to play at school events where it would be less practical for the Concert Band to perform.

Ivan Asen III was the son of Mitso Asen of Bulgaria and Maria of Bulgaria, a daughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Irene of Thessalonica. He was probably born in about 1259/60, and died in exile in 1303. Fearing the rapid success of Ivaylo of Bulgaria, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos summoned Ivan Asen to his court, granted him the title of despotƒìs, and married him to his eldest daughter Irene Palaiologina in 1277 or 1278. Michael VIII then sent several Byzantine armies to attempt to assert Ivan Asen III on the throne of Bulgaria. Although Ivailo defeated several of these attempts, he was blockaded for three months in DrƒÉstƒÉr (Silistra) by the Mongol allies of Michael VIII. In the interval a Byzantine force besieged the Bulgarian capital TƒÉrnovo and, hearing a rumor of Ivailo's death in battle, the local nobility surrendered and accepted Ivan Asen III as emperor in 1279. To strengthen his position in Tarnovo, Ivan Asen III married his sister Maria (Kira Maria) to the Bulgaro-Cuman nobleman George Terter, but failed to assert himself throughout the country. Ivailo reappeared before the walls of the capital and defeated two Byzantine attempts to relieve Ivan Asen III. Despairing of success, Ivan Asen III and Irene Palaiologina secretly fled Tarnovo with choice treasures from the palace treasury, including pieces captured from defeated Byzantine Emperors in former victories. Reaching Mesembria (NesebƒÉr), the imperial couple sailed for Constantinople, where the enraged Michael VIII refused to receive them for days for their cowardice. In 1280 or 1281 Ivan Asen III traveled to the Golden Horde, competing with Ivailo in a bid to win support for restoration in Bulgaria. The Mongol chieftain Nogai Khan eventually had Ivailo murdered, but failed to restore Ivan Asen III in Bulgaria. The latter returned to his family possessions in the Troad, and died in 1303. Family Ivan Asen III and Irene Palaiologina became the progenitors of the large and influential family Asan (or Asanes) in the Byzantine Empire, which prospered in various court and provincial offices until the end of the empire and its dependencies in the mid-15th century. One of Ivan Asen III's descendants, Irene Asanina (daughter of his son Andronikos Asan) married the future Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos and through their daughter Helena (who married emperor John V Palaiologos), became the ancestress of later Byzantine emperors. By his marriage with Irene Palaiologina, Ivan Asen III had the following children: # Michael Asan, titular emperor of Bulgaria. # Andronikos Asan, father of Irene Asanina, wife of John VI Kantakouzenos. # Isaac Asan. # Manuel Asan. # Constantine Asan. # Theodora Asanina, who married Fernan Jimenez d'Aunez and then Manuel Tagaris. # Maria Asanina, who married Roger de Flor.

He was born in 1324 or 1325, and he died in or after 1397. Despite being the eldest surviving son of Ivan Alexander, Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited in favour of his half-brother Ivan Shishman and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin. When the Hungarians attacked and occupied his domains, he received assistance from his father and the invaders were driven away. After the death of Ivan Alexander in 1371 Ivan Sratsimir broke off ties with Tarnovo and even placed the archbishop of Vidin under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to demonstrate his independence. Due to its geographical position, Vidin was initially safe from attacks by the Ottoman Turks who were ravaging the Balkans to the south and Ivan Sratsimir made no attempts to assist Ivan Shishman in his struggle against the Ottomans. Only after the fall of Tarnovo in 1393 did his policy become more active and he eventually joined the crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, after the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the Ottomans marched to Vidin and seized it. Ivan Sratsimir was captured and imprisoned in Bursa where he was probably strangled. Although his son Constantine II claimed the title Emperor of Bulgaria and at times controlled some parts of his father's realm, Ivan Sratsimir is generally regarded by historians as the last ruler of medieval Bulgaria. Sratsimir Hill on Trinity Peninsula in Antarctica is named after him.Sratsimir Hill. SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica. Early life Image of Ivan Sratsimir from a contemporary Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle. Born in Lovech in 1324 or 1325, Ivan Sratsimir was the second son of Theodora and Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371), who was despot of Lovech at the time .–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 293 Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed co-emperor by his father in 1337 in his early teenage years, along with his brothers Michael Asen IV and Ivan Asen IV.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, p. 611 This proved fatal for Bulgaria because the prerogatives of his sons' authority were not defined, leading to rivalry between the brothers. After his proclamation Ivan Sratsimir was given the rule of Vidin as an apanage, because his father wanted to have the different regions of the state under the direct rule of his family. In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in prominence because he was married with Anna of Wallachia and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor in order to secure the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, p. 612 In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, pp. 293‚Äì294 The conflict climaxed in 1355‚Äì1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 294 According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah- Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son is the fact that the image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.Fine, p. 366 Emperor in Vidin BULGARIA, Second Empire.

Raduchev & Zhekov Type =Early reign and Hungarian invasion= Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed emperor in Vidin in 1356 and began to use the title Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks, as his father. In order to secure the alliance of Wallachia, he married his first cousin Anna, the daughter of the Wallachian voivode Nicholas Alexander, in 1356 or 1357, a move that was probably arranged with the help of Ivan Sratsimir's mother Theodora as a reaction to the actions of Ivan Alexander. He ruled with the tacit consent of his father for around ten years until 1365 when the Hungarian king Louis I, who styled himself King of Bulgaria among the other titles, demanded that Ivan Sratsimir acknowledge his suzerainty and become his vassal. When the Bulgarian ruler refused, Louis I marched from Hungary on 1 May 1365 and captured Vidin on 2 June after a brief siege.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 202 The rest of the Vidin Tsardom was conquered in the next three months. Ivan Sratsimir and his family were captured and taken to the castle of Humnik in Croatia and the region of Vidin was placed under direct Hungarian rule governed through a Ban appointed by the King of Hungary. Ivan Sratsimir spent four years in honorary Hungarian captivity and he and his family were forced to accept Catholicism. The Hungarians also sent Franciscan friars to convert the population of the Vidin Tsardom to Catholicism. Although the Hungarian accounts boasted that the Franciscans converted 200,000 people, or a third of the region's population, this move brought great discontent among the Bulgarian population and eventually failed.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, pp. 604‚Äì605 That was in fact the first forceful conversion in the country after the Christianization of Bulgaria five centuries earlier.

The allied campaign was a success and after it was supported by a popular uprising in Vidin against the Catholic clergy and the Hungarian authority, Louis I had to give up his claims and restore Ivan Sratsimir to the throne in Vidin in the autumn of 1369.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, pp. 606‚Äì607 According to historian J. Fine, Ivan Sratsimir was allowed to return to Vidin by Louis I as a Hungarian vassal because of his popularity among the population and because Ivan Sratsimir used the Hungarian patronage to assert independence from his father and later to resist his brother in Tarnovo.Fine, p. 367 =Reign after 1371= The Second Bulgarian Empire after the death of Ivan Alexander. Ivan Sratsimir controlled Vidin to the north-west, his brother Ivan Shishman the central regions and despot Dobrotitsa controlled the coast to the east. After the death of emperor Ivan Alexander on 17 February 1371, Ivan Sratsimir broke off the last links that connected Tarnovo and Vidin and began to rule without even nominal acknowledgement to the authorities in Tarnovo. He was since styled, as written in the accounts of the Patriarchate of Constantinople: \\"How should the Patriarch and the Archbishop write to ruler of Vidin and emperor Kamtsimir (Sratsimir): Most Faithful and Allmighty ruler of Vidin the whole of Bulgaria...\\"–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, pp. 648‚Äì649 The authority of Ivan Sratsimir was treated as equal to that of Ivan Shishman and the details suggest that he was even presented as a senior ruler.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, pp. 649‚Äì650 Due to the insufficient information, some early Bulgarian historians such as Konstantin Jireƒçek supported the hypothesis that Ivan Sratsimir and Ivan Shishman were engaged in a military conflict over Sofia–ò—Ä–µ—á–µ–∫, p. 387 but the idea has been dismissed by most modern historians.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, p. 651 In fact, despite the rivalry, the brothers scrupulously maintained relations until 1381 and Ivan Sratsimir was even considered as a potential successor by Ivan Shishman. However, J. Fine suggests that immediately after the death of his father, Ivan Sratsimir tried to seize the control over the whole of Bulgaria for himself and even captured and held Sofia for a year or two, which led to permanent hostility between the two brothers and spoiled any chances for a common Bulgarian resistance against the Ottomans.Fine, p. 368 The relations between the two Bulgarian states worsened in 1381 when Ivan Sratsimir broke the connections with the Bulgarian Patriarchate in Tarnovo and instead placed the Archbishopric of Vidin under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, p. 649 That decision was a demonstration of the independence of Vidin from Tarnovo but did not lead to open conflict between the two.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 296 The hostility between Ivan Sratsimir and Ivan Shishman remained on the eve of the Ottoman invasion. Most historians agree that in the 1370s and the early 1380s Vidin was still away from the route of the Ottoman campaigns and was not endangered. During and after the massive Ottoman invasion in north-eastern Bulgaria in 1388, sources suggest that relations between the two brothers were uneasy. As a result of the Ottoman success in the 1388 campaign and the resulting changes of the balance of power, Ivan Sratsimir had to become an Ottoman vassal and to accept an Ottoman garrison in Vidin.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, p. 664 Ivan Sratsimir remained inactive while the Ottomans destroyed the remains of the Tarnovo Tsardom ‚Äì Tarnovo fell in 1393 and Ivan Shishman was killed in 1395.

Some of the works that have survived from that period include the Tetraevangelia of the Metropolitan Danail and the Vidin collection from 1360, ordered by Empress Anna, which contains the hagiographies of thirteen Orthodox saints and a description of the holy sites in Jerusalem. Joasaph of Bdin, who was elected Archbishop of Vidin in 1392 wrote Praising epistle for the movement of St Philotea relics from Tarnovo to Vidin which contained all features of the Tarnovo Literary School. Joasaph also demonstrated great respect to Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo, the most prominent figure in the Bulgarian cultural and literary life in the second half of the 14th century.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, pp. 247‚Äì248 In the late 1360s the region of Vidin resisted the forceful conversion to Catholicism undertaken by the Hungarian authorities and remained Orthodox. The subjugation of Vidin to the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1381 led to a conflict with the Patriarchate of Tarnovo but after the fall of Tarnovo and the dissolution of the Bulgarian Patriarchate, Ivan Sratsimir tried to negotiate with the Ottomans to place some of the former eparchies of Tarnovo in his jurisdiction. In 1395 he sent there a delegation led by the heir to the throne Constantine and Joasaph of Bdin to bring the relics of Saint Philotea to Vidin. According to Joasaph the mission was successful and the relics remained in Vidin for the next two centuries.

The Bra»ôov Charter, the only surviving document made by Ivan Sratsimir, grants the merchants of the Transylvanian town of Bra»ôov free access and the right to trade in his realm. Family Nothing is known about Ivan Stratsimir's first wife and children apart from their existence. Ivan Sratsimir married for a second time to his first cousin, Anna of Wallachia, a daughter of his uncle Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia, and had at least three children. Dorothea (Doroslava), married Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia and became the first Queen of Bosnia while Constantine II succeeded him as Emperor of Bulgaria.

The authority of Ivan Shishman was limited to the central parts of the Bulgarian Empire. In the wake of the death of Ivan Alexander, the Bulgarian Empire was subdivided into three kingdoms among his sons, with Ivan Shishman taking the T–∞rnovo Kingdom situated in central Bulgaria and his half brother Ivan Sratsimir holding the Vidin Tsardom. Although his struggle to repel the Ottomans differentiated him from the other rulers on the Balkans like the Serbian despot Stephan Lazarevic who became a loyal vassal to the Ottomans and paid annual tribute and participated in all of the Ottoman campaigns subsequent to the battle of Kosovo, contributing a 5,000 strong contingent of christian knights. Although Ivan Shishman has been categorized as indecisive and inconsistent in his policy in the past, this was done with little regard for an understanding of the context of the conditions and limited resources that this ruler had at his disposal. It is notable that Ivan Shishman is the only Balkan ruler for whom there is no evidence of tribute paid to the Ottoman empire or any military aid provided. Based on historical evidence and the numerous folk songs of the region glorifying his struggle against the Ottoman invaders, the image of Ivan Shishman is one of fierce and concerted resistance to the Ottoman incursions. Regardless, in 1393 the Ottoman Turks seized the capital Tarnovo. Two years later, Sultan Bayezid I captured Nicopolis with a surprise approach from the north of the fortress after two failed campaigns in Hungary and Wallachia, summoning Ivan Shishman on the false pretense of a discussion and had him executed by beheading. Despite the military and political weakness, during his rule Bulgaria remained a major cultural center and the ideas of Hesychasm dominated the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo became the most prominent cultural figure of the country. A number of texts were written or translated and an orthographic reform of the Bulgarian language was issued with synchronised rules. After the fall of Bulgaria, a number of scholars found refuge in the other Orthodox countries and brought the achievements of the Bulgarian culture to them. His reign was inextricably connected to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman domination. In Bulgarian folklore Ivan Shishman is portrayed as a legendary and heroic ruler who desperately fought against the overwhelming Ottoman forces. There are numerous sites, geographical features and fortresses named after him throughout Bulgaria.  Biography  BULGARIA, Second Empire. Ivan ≈†i≈°man. 1371‚Äì1395. BI Trachy (18mm, 0.95 g, 7h). Tarnovo mint. Lion rampant left / Large ≈†i≈°man monogram across field. = Early life = Born in 1350 or 1351, Ivan Shishman was the eldest son of emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371) and his second wife Sarah‚ÄìTheodora, a Jew converted to the Eastern Orthodox Church. His birth brought up the issue of the succession to the Bulgarian throne. Ivan Shishman had two elder brothers by the Ivan Alexander's first wife, Theodora of Wallachia. The eldest one, Michael Asen, was proclaimed successor to the throne and co-emperor shortly after Ivan Alexander's accession to the throne. However, Michael Asen's early death in battle against the Ottomans in 1355 put forward the question of succession once more. It is likely that Sarah‚ÄìTheodora pressured Ivan Alexander to select her own son as his successor, although Ivan Sratsimir would have come next under the majorat system. The issue was decided in Ivan Shishman's favour because the latter was born in the purple (after his father was crowned), thus making him eligible as successor. By the end of 1355, Ivan Shishman had been proclaimed heir to the throne and co-emperor. These events led to a conflict with Ivan Sratsimir, who was in turn given the rule of Vidin, probably as a compensation. Another indirect piece of evidence for the feud is the fact that Ivan Sratsimir's portrait not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander, where the whole family of the emperor was otherwise presented. In 1356 Ivan Sratsimir proclaimed himself emperor of Vidin. Together with his father and younger brother Ivan Asen V, Ivan Shishman presided over the church synods at Tarnovo in the late 1360s. = Emperor of Bulgaria =  Reign before 1388  The Second Bulgarian Empire after the coronation of Ivan Shishman. His brother Ivan Sratsimir controlled Vidin to the north-west and despot Dobrotitsa controlled the coast to the east. Ivan Shishman was proclaimed emperor after the death of his father on 17 February 1371, when he was in his early 20s. Ivan Shishman inherited only parts of his father's realm: he ruled the lands between the Iskar River and Silistra, the valley of Sofia, parts of the Rhodope mountains and northern Thrace. To the west, the areas centred around Vidin recognised Ivan Sratsimir as emperor of Bulgaria, while to the east, the Principality of Karvuna, encompassing the coastal strip between the Danube Delta and Cape Emine and under the rule of despot Dobrotitsa, did not recognise the authority of the emperor of Tarnovo either. Contemporary chroniclers such as Johann Schiltberger speak of three regions, all of which were called Bulgaria. Thus, the country was divided on the eve of the Ottoman invasion, despite Ivan Shishman's claims in his royal charters. In these, he styled himself as a primary emperor in an attempt to emphasise the existence of a hierarchy among the rulers of the three Bulgarias. However, that hierarchy remained only in paper; to further assert their independence from Tarnovo, both Ivan Sratsimir and Dobrotitsa separated their dioceses from the Bulgarian Patriarchate in Tarnovo. According to Fine, immediately after the death of Ivan Alexander, Ivan Sratsimir tried to conquer the whole of Bulgaria. He was able to capture Sofia and managed to hold the city for one or two years. The rivalry between the two brothers for Sofia had a strong tradition in the Bulgarian historiography since the time of Konstantin Jireƒçek, but it has been dismissed by many modern Bulgarian historians. Only a few months after the ascension of Ivan Shishman to the throne, on 26 September 1371, the Ottoman Turks defeated a large Christian army led by the Serbian brothers Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá and Jovan Uglje≈°a in the Battle of Chernomen. Although Uglje≈°a had tried to create a broad coalition that would include Bulgaria, Ivan Shishman, who had to strengthen his own authority, did not join. After their victory at Chernomen, the Turks immediately turned on Bulgaria. Ottoman sultan Murad I forced Ivan Shishman to retreat to the north of the Balkan Mountains and conquered northern Thrace, the Rhodopes, Kostenets, Ihtiman and Samokov. Unable to resist the attacks, Ivan Shishman had to negotiate with the Ottomans in 1373. He was forced to become an Ottoman vassal and to allow his sister Kera Tamara, who was known for her beauty, to become a wife of Murad I. Under this agreement, Bulgaria regained some of the conquered territories such as Ihtiman and Samokov, and began nearly ten years of uneasy peace with the Turks. Despite the vassalage and the peace treaty, Ottoman raids were renewed in the beginning of the 1380s and culminated in 1385 with the fall of Sofia, the last stronghold of Ivan Shishman to the south of the Balkan Mountains. In the meantime, Ivan Shishman was engaged in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386. There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war was linked to the hostilities between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who had the support of the Wallachian rulers and was married to Anna of the House of Basarab.  Fall of Bulgaria  In 1387, the united forces of the Principality of Serbia and the Kingdom of Bosnia managed to defeat the Ottomans in the Battle of Ploƒçnik. Encouraged by the Christian success, Ivan Shishman immediately invalidated his vassalage to Murad I and refused to send troops in his support in 1388. The Ottomans reacted by sending a 30,000-strong army, under the command of the Grand Vizier √áandarlƒ±zade Ali Pasha, to the north of the Balkan Mountains. The Ottoman troops seized the fortresses of Shumen, Madara, Venchan and Ovech. Ivan Shishman left Tarnovo and headed to Nikopol, where he was besieged and forced to ask for peace. The Ottomans requested that he reconfirm his vassalage in addition to surrendering Silistra, at the time the most populous Bulgarian city along the Danube. However, Ivan Shishman, reassured by his neighbours that he would receive support and the preparations of Serbia for war, not only refused to let the Ottomans in the city, but also strengthened its walls. Ali Pasha crossed the Balkan Mountains for a second time to consecutively capture Shumen, Cherven, Svishtov and once again besiege Ivan Shishman in Nikopol. Surprised by the swift Ottoman response and having not received the promised assistance, the Bulgarian emperor had to ask for peace. His pleas were accepted, but the terms were harsher than the original: not only Silistra was to be surrendered, but Ottoman garrisons were to be stationed in other Bulgarian cities, most notably Shumen and Ovech. A silver coin of Ivan Shishman After the defeat of the Serbs and Bosniaks in the Battle of Kosovo on 15 June 1389, Ivan Shishman had to seek help from Hungary. During the winter of 1391‚Äì1392, he entered into secret negotiations with the King of Hungary Sigismund, who was planning a campaign against the Turks. The new Ottoman sultan Bayezid I pretended to have peaceful intentions in order to cut off Ivan Shishman from his alliance with the Hungarians. However, in the spring of 1393 Bayezid gathered a large army from his dominions in the Balkans and Asia Minor and attacked Bulgaria. The Ottomans marched to the capital Tarnovo and besieged it. The defence of the capital was led by Patriarch Evtimiy because Ivan Shishman was located in Nikopol, presumably for better communication with Sigismund. After a three- month siege, Tarnovo fell on 17 July. According to the contemporary Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak, the city was not captured because of the Ottoman military strength but due to treason. The Ottoman campaign of 1393 devastated Bulgaria; in the wake of that invasion, the lands of Ivan Shishman were limited to Nikopol and several towns along the Danube. Upon his return from Wallachia after the Battle of Rovine in 1395, Bayezid I attacked and captured Nikopol and, according to the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle, murdered Ivan Shishman on 3 June 1395. A Byzantine chronicle gives the date as 29 October. However, some sources suggest that the Bulgarian ruler was captured and died in prison. = Culture and religion = Rila Charter of Ivan Shishman, issued in 1378 to grant privileges to the Rila Monastery. He was styled in the charter as \\"In Christ the Lord Faithful Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Greeks. The cultural revival that made the historians call the reign of Ivan Alexander a \\"Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture\\" continued under his son. The most prominent figure in that field during the last quarter of the 14th century was Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo (r. 1375‚Äì1393), a disciple of Theodosius of Tarnovo. In 1371 he established the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, a few kilometres to the north of Tarnovo, and turned it into an important cultural center and a major hub of the Tarnovo Literary School. Evtimiy wrote a number of religious works, including hagiographies, praises and letters, but is most famous with the orthographic reform and the standardization of the Bulgarian language, which had an impact in Serbia, Wallachia and the Russian principalities. Evtimiy thought that many of the scholars were not sufficiently prepared, and that the translations of Greek texts in local dialects and peculiarities could lead to misinterpretation of the original and eventually to heretism. The texts regarding the reform did not survive, although its character has been partly recreated by the historians and linguists by analyzing the works of Evtimiy himself and his disciples. The orthography was inspired by the original Old Church Slavonic during the heyday of the First Bulgarian Empire; the reform also included syntax changes and enrichment of the lexicon with a number of synonyms to avoid repetition. To ensure the success of the reform, all texts had to receive approval before publishing, a move that was supported by Ivan Shishman in his edicts. The capital Tarnovo was the main cultural center at that time. Patriarch Evtimiy wrote about it: {  –†–∞–¥–≤–∞ —Å–µ –¥–Ω–µ—Å —Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∏—è—Ç –≥—Ä–∞–¥ –¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤ –∏ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–≤–∞ —Ü–∞—Ä—É–≤–∞—â–∏—è –Ω–∞–¥ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ, –∫–∞—Ç–æ –∫–∞–∑–≤–∞: –†–∞–¥–≤–∞–π —Å–µ —Å –º–µ–Ω, –º–∞–π–∫–æ –Ω–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ, –∑–∞—â–æ—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∏—è, –∫–æ–∏—Ç–æ —Ç–∏ –æ—Ç–≥–ª–µ–¥–∞, —Å —Ç—è—Ö —Å–µ —Å–ª–∞–≤—è —Å–µ–≥–∞ –∞–∑, —á–µ –≥–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–¥–æ–±–∏—Ö –∑–∞ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –∏ –∑–∞—Å—Ç—ä–ø–Ω–∏—Ü–∏. –ù–∞–∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –±–ª–∞–∂–µ–Ω —Å—ä–º –∞–∑ —Å—Ä–µ–¥ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ, –∑–∞—â–æ—Ç–æ –¥–æ–±—Ä–∏ —Å—ä–∫—Ä–æ–≤–∏—â–∞ —Å—ä–±—Ä–∞—Ö - —á–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –º–æ—â–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–µ—Ç—Ü–∏—Ç–µ, —á–∏–µ—Ç–æ –∑–∞—Å—Ç—ä–ø–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫–∞—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–∂–∞–≤–∞–º, –æ—Ç –≤—Å—è–∫–∞–∫–≤–∏ –∑–ª–∏–Ω–∏ —Å–µ –∏–∑–±–∞–≤—è–º.  : The glorious city of Tarnovo is rejoicing today : And invokes the reigning over the cities, saying: : Rejoice with me, mother of the cities, : Because with those that you raised, : I am lauding now, : For I acquired them for aides and advocates. : I am truly blissful among the cities, : Because I gathered good treasures ‚Äì : The wonderful relics of the saints, : Whose advocacy when I have, : I get rid of all evil.  } Icon of Saint Ivan Shishman Hesychasm remained the main movement in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church during the reign of Ivan Shishman and the Patriarch was its supporter. Bulgaria was a major center of hesychast ideas along with the Byzantine Empire. Evtimiy was an active opponent to heresies, but it appears that since the mid 14th century the influence of the Bogomils, the most prominent heretic movement in the Balkans at the time, had been greatly reduced in Bulgaria and no document mentions them after 1360. Other sects, such as the Barlaamites, were also persecuted and repressed. Evtimiy had strict views on moral and took firm positions against divorce and third or fourth marriages for widowers and widows. After the collapse of the Bulgarian Empire, many scholars emigrated to Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia and the Russian principalities; they brought Bulgarian cultural achievements, books, and hesychastic ideas to these lands. The Bulgarian influence was so great that is often referred to as a \\"Second South Slavic influence on Russia\\". Some of the most prominent Bulgarian √©migr√©s included Constantine of Kostenets, who worked in Serbia, and Cyprian and Gregory Tsamblak in the Russian lands. The economy was in decline since the loss of the major ports of Messembria and Anchialus to the Savoyard crusade a few years before Ivan Shishman was crowned. After the death of Ivan Alexander and the breakaway of Dobrotitsa's Principality of Karvuna, Tarnovo also lost its most important port Varna, leading to a reduction in commerce and tax revenues. The persistent Ottoman raids brought devastation, hunger and depopulation which led to a sharp decline in the cultivated lands. = Assessment and legacy = Bulgarian historians have had mostly negative assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is often viewed as having intruded onto the throne due to the intrigues of his mother and thus taking the place of the rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country on the eve of the Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, \\"the land of emperor Shishman\\". The memory of Ivan Shishman remained during the first centuries of the Ottoman rule. During the First Tarnovo uprising in 1598, the one of the rebels' leaders, whose name is unknown, claimed to have been a descendant of Ivan Shishman and was proclaimed emperor under the name Shishman III. Almost a century later, in 1686, a second uprising in Tarnovo was headed by Rostislav Stratimirovic, who also claimed to have belonged to the Shishman dynasty and styled himself as Prince of Bulgaria. Ivan Shishman is now among the most popular and well-known rulers in the Third Bulgarian State. There are a number of works dedicated to him or his rule, including the 1969 film Tsar Ivan Shishman by Yuri Arnaudov and the song \\"Tsar Ivan Shishman\\" by the heavy metal band Epizod in the 2004 album \\"Saint Patriarch Evtimiy\\". Shishman Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is also named after him.  Legends  Ivan Shishman is the most prominent medieval ruler in Bulgarian folklore. His name is heard in a number of legends, myths, tales and songs. He is represented as a heroic ruler who fought and died for his country, facing overwhelming enemy forces. There are a number of places throughout Bulgaria named after him, ranging from castles and ruins to rocks, caves and localities. That legendary \\"geography\\" is mainly concentrated in the region of Sofia, Ihtiman and Samokov, though it extends to the Rhodope Mountains, Sredna Gora, Vratsa, Pleven, Prilep, Varna, etc. Near Samokov are the ruins of \\"Shishman's Fortress\\" with the emperor's wells, which reputedly spouted from the ruler's seven wounds. Further north, along the cliffs and heights of the Iskar Gorge, are \\"Shishman's Holes\\", the caves where he hid while fighting the Ottomans for seven years. Other related toponyms usually associated with the emperor's last stand are Kokalyane (derived from kokal, meaning \\"bone\\"), Cherepish (from cherep, \\"skull\\") and Lyutibrod (\\"Fierce Ford\\"), all thought to be hinting at the fate of the perished Bulgarian troops. A miniature of the juvenile Ivan Shishman from the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander. One of the most famous legends is about Shishman's final battle. The Ottomans camped at Kostenets, near the origins of the Maritsa river, while the Bulgarians were near Samokov, on a hill. After a fierce battle, Ivan Shishman was wounded seven times and retreated to the fortress, where he died; on the battlefield seven springs appeared, one for each of the emperor's wounds. He is also said to have fought in the Balkan mountains at Shishkin grad (\\"Shishman's town\\"), between Sliven and Kazanlak, where he killed 10,000 janissaries in a huge battle. The 18th century Bulgarian enlightener Paisius of Hilendar wrote in his Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya that during the siege of Tarnovo Ivan Shishman managed to reach Sofia with his boyars. He hid his treasury in the Iskar gorge and fought against the Turks for seven years before dying in battle. Some versions suggest that Kokalyanski Urvich remained the last fortress to fall and before Shishman died he buried treasure under the castle and tried to escape by cutting a passage through the mountain. The repeating motif of the treasure is a sacral symbol of the Bulgarian statehood and the usual locations of the imperial jewellery are monasteries, lakes or hideouts under rivers. Being undiscovered by the invaders, the treasure symbolises the sovereignty and power of the Bulgarian Empire and its inevitable resurrection. There are also a number of parallels between the legends about Ivan Shishman and the hagiography of saints, especially John of Rila, including the almost identical route of the emperor, Tarnovo-Sofia-Samokov in Rila, and the route of the return of the relics of Saint John of Rila to the Rila Monastery in 15th century ‚Äì Tarnovo-Sofia-Rila, and also the motif of the immortal rulers who foresees the restoration of the country. {  –û—Ç–∫–∞–∫ —Å–µ –µ, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –∑–æ—Ä–∞ –∑–∞–∑–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∞, –û—Ç—Ç–æ–≥–∞–∑ –µ, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≤—ä—Ä–≤—è–ª–∞, –ö–æ–Ω –¥–æ –∫–æ–Ω—è, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, —é–Ω–∞–∫ –¥–æ —é–Ω–∞–∫–∞, –°–∞–±–∏—Ç–µ –∏–º, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –∫–∞–∫—Ç–æ —è—Å–Ω–æ —Å–ª—ä–Ω—Ü–µ, –û–≥—ä–Ω —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∫–∞, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –ø—Ä–µ–∑ –≥–æ—Ä–∞ –∑–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∞, –í–æ–π–≤–æ–¥–∞ –∏–º, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, —Å–∞–º —Ü–∞—Ä –ò–≤–∞–Ω –®–∏—à–º–∞–Ω, –û—Ç–≥–æ–≤–∞—Ä—è, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, —Å–∞–º —Ü–∞—Ä –ò–≤–∞–Ω –®–∏—à–º–∞–Ω: –ë–æ–∂–µ —Å–∏–ª–Ω–∏, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –±–æ–∂–µ —Å—ä–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—é, –ü–æ–º–æ–≥–Ω–∏ –Ω–∏, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, —Å–∏–ª–∞ –∏ —é–Ω–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ! –ë–æ–π —â–µ–º –¥–∞ —Å–µ –±–∏–µ–º, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –Ω–∞ —Å–æ—Ñ–∏–π—Å–∫–æ –ø–æ–ª–µ, –ö—Ä—ä–≤ —â–µ –ª–µ–µ–º, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, –∑–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–æ –∏–º–µ, –©–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏–º, –º–∏–ª–∞ –º–æ—è –º–∞–π–∫–æ –ª–µ, —Ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—è–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –≤—è—Ä–∞.  : Since when has, my dear mother, d–∞wn raised, : Since then has, my dear mother, an army marched, : Horse to horse, my dear mother, champion to champion, : Their sabres, my dear mother, as clear sun, : Fire is shining, my dear mother, through green forest, : Their leader, my dear mother, Tsar Ivan Shishman himself, : Responds, my dear mother, Tsar Ivan Shishman himself: : Allmighty God, my dear mother, creator God, : Help us, my dear mother, with strength and courage! : We are going to fight a battle, my dear mother, on the valley of Sofia, : We are going to spill blood, my dear mother, in the name of Christ, : We are going to praise, my dear mother, the Christian faith.  } Extract of a folklore song, collected by the Miladinov Brothers. Ivan Shishman is one of the few rulers to be mentioned in the Bulgarian folklore songs and, as in the legends, is a subject of mystification. His figure can even be seen in Christmas carols, where he is presented either as a saint in the role of protector or as a hero fighting dragons and oppressors, usually presented as Tatars because of the resemblance with the Tartarus. The songs about Ivan Shishman contain many parallels with nature and collocations which are typical of Bulgarian folklore. In a song from the region of Sliven, the death of the emperor brings chaos to nature and rivers of \\"black blood\\" (typical folklore collocation) start flowing. The place of Ivan Shishman in the Bulgarian legends and folklore is most likely attributed to the fact that he was the last Bulgarian emperor in Tarnovo. There are many similarities with his contemporary King Marko, the ruler of Prilep, who did little to resist the Ottoman invasion but later became the most popular character in the Bulgarian folklore. The people desired to berhyme the image of the \\"ideal emperor\\", a defender and protector, whose strength they needed to survive under Ottoman domination, and not the actual historical personality. As time passed the mystification deepened and the legends became more distant from the actual events during his rule. During the Bulgarian National Revival the tales about Ivan Shishman began to increasingly include patriotic elements.  Family  Ivan Shishman was married first to a Bulgarian named Kira Maria, who died in the early 1380s. His second wife was Dragana Lazareviƒá, a daughter of Prince Lazar of Serbia and Milica Nemanjiƒá and kin to the previous Serbian dynasty. His eldest son Alexander converted to Islam under the name Iskender, and died as governor of Smyrna in 1418, while his second son Fruzhin participated in revolts and campaigns against the Ottomans, trying to liberate his father's realm, and died in Hungary after 1444. It has been speculated by historians, such as Plamen Pavlov, that Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople was an illegitimate son of Ivan Shishman. The claim is based on a Byzantine text which says \\"They said that he [Jozeph II] was an illegitimate son of the emperor Shishman.\\"  Timeline  * 1350 or 1351 ‚Äì Ivan Shishman was born * By 1355 ‚Äì Proclaimed heir to the throne and co-emperor * 17 February 1371 ‚Äì Succeeds his father as Emperor of Bulgaria in Tarnovo * 1373 ‚Äì Becomes Ottoman vassal in return for some previously conquered lands * 1378 ‚Äì Issues the Rila Charter * 1385 ‚Äì Fall of Sofia * 1384 to 1386 ‚Äì War against Wallachia * 1388 ‚Äì The Ottomans invade eastern Bulgaria and conquer a number of towns * 17 July 1393 ‚Äì Fall of Tarnovo * 3 June 1395 ‚Äì The Ottomans capture Nikopol and Ivan Shishman is executed  Footnotes  = Notes = = Citations =  Sources  = References =     External links   * *Brothers ‚Äì Marko and Shishman, Dusko Lopandic, No 3122, 2011. *Who was Duke Momcilo?, Dusko Lopandic, No 3114, 2011 Category:1350s births Category:1395 deaths Category:14th-century Bulgarian emperors Category:Bulgarian people of Jewish descent Category:People executed by the Ottoman Empire by decapitation Category:Executed Bulgarian people Category:Murdered Bulgarian monarchs Category:14th-century executions by the Ottoman Empire Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs Category:Sratsimir dynasty Category:People of the Bulgarian‚ÄìOttoman wars ","title":"Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria"},{"id":"2096891","text":"Theodore Svetoslav (, Todor Svetoslav and also –¢–µ–æ–¥–æ—Ä –°–≤–µ—Ç–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤, Teodor Svetoslav) ruled as emperor (tsar) of Bulgaria from 1300 to 1322. The date of his birth is unknown. He was a wise and capable ruler who brought stability and relative prosperity to the Bulgarian Empire after two decades of constant Mongol intervention in the internal issues of the Empire. Theodore Svetoslav's reign began with the return of Southern Bessarabia to Bulgaria and a few years later he managed to defeat the Byzantines and retake most of northern Thrace occupied by them during the crisis. After 1307 he led a peaceful policy towards all neighbours, which resulted in expanded trade and economy. Apart from his external and economic successes, Theodore Svetoslav dealt with the separatists among the nobility including his uncle. He persecuted the traitors who he thought were responsible for the Mongol interference and even the Patriarch, Joachim III, was executed. Early life Theodore Svetoslav was the son of George Terter I by Maria. Soon after the accession of Ivan Asen III in 1279 his father divorced his mother in order to marry the sister of the new emperor. Maria and Theodore Svetoslav were sent to the Byzantine Empire as hostages, and settled in Nicaea. The accession of George Terter I to the throne in 1280 did not alter matters, but in 1281 Theodore Svetoslav was betrothed (in absentia) to a daughter of the sebastokrat≈çr John I Doukas of Thessaly, as part of a diplomatic alliance. The young bride-to-be arrived in TƒÉrnovo, but never met her intended husband. In 1284 George Terter I concluded a new treaty with Andronikos II Palaiologos, and retrieved his first wife, while Theodore Svetoslav at first remained a hostage. The same treaty required the breaking off of the alliance with Thessaly and Theodore Svetoslav's intended bride was also sent to Byzantium. It was only in 1285 that the Patriarch of Bulgaria Joakim III arrived in Constantinople and arranged for the release of Theodore Svetoslav, who was now supposed to marry a daughter of the high court official John Synadenos. We have no information whether this marriage materialized. Political activities In Bulgaria Theodore Svetoslav was associated as co-emperor by his father, who issued coins representing them side by side. Nevertheless, after particularly devastating Mongol raids, George Terter I dispatched his son as hostage to Nogai Khan, the effective leader of the Mongol Golden Horde in about 1289. Perhaps in connection with the same events, Theodore Svetoslav's unnamed sister married Nogai's son Chaka. During part of his exile, Theodore Svetoslav became impoverished and sought to improve his fortunes by marrying the rich Euphrosyne, the god- daughter of Nogai's wife Euphrosyne Palaiologina, who was herself an illegitimate daughter of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Theodore Svetoslav left obscurity in 1298 or 1299, when he accompanied his brother-in-law Chaka in an invasion of Bulgaria. The regency for Ivan II fled TƒÉrnovo in 1299, and Theodore Svetoslav helped convince the Bulgarian nobility to accept Chaka as ruler. However, the armies of the khan of the Golden Horde Toqta entered Bulgaria in pursuit of his enemy Chaka, and Theodore Svetoslav promptly organized a plot, deposing Chaka and having him strangled in prison in 1300. Theodore Svetoslav now became emperor of Bulgaria and sent Chaka's severed head as a present to Toqta, who withdrew his armies from the country. Emperor of Bulgaria Second Bulgarian Empire under Theodore Svetoslav Military campaign of Theodore Svetoslav (1303-1304) The reign of Theodore Svetoslav is connected with the internal stabilization and pacification of the country, the end of Mongol overlordship, the reassertion of relatively effective central control over outlying provinces, and the recovery of portions of Thrace lost to the Byzantine Empire since the wars against Ivaylo of Bulgaria. Theodore Svetoslav pursued a ruthless course of action, punishing all who stood in his way, including his former benefactor, Patriarch Joachim III, who was accused of treason and executed. In the face of the new emperor's brutality, some noble factions sought to replace him with other claimants to the throne, backed by Andronikos II. A new claimant appeared in the person of the sebastokrat≈çr Radoslav Vo√Øsil or Vojsil, from Sredna Gora, a brother of the former emperor Smilets, who was defeated, and captured by Theodore Svetoslav's uncle, the despotƒìs Aldimir (Eltimir), at KrƒÉn in about 1301. Another pretender was the former emperor Michael Asen II, who unsuccessfully tried to advance into Bulgaria with a Byzantine army in about 1302. Theodore Svetoslav exchanged thirteen high-ranking Byzantine officers captured on Radoslav's defeat for his father George Terter I, whom he settled in a life of luxury in an unidentified city. =Expansion= As a consequence of his victories, Theodore Svetoslav felt secure enough to move on to the offensive by 1303 and captured the fortresses of northeastern Thrace, including Mesembria (NesebƒÉr), Anchialos (Pomorie), Sozopolis (Sozopol), and Agathopolis (Ahtopol) in 1304. The Byzantine counterattack failed at the battle of Skafida near Poros (Burgas), where the Co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos was turned to flight. Nevertheless, the war continued, with Michael IX and Theodore Svetoslav taking turns pillaging each other's lands. In the following 1305 Theodore Svetoslav's uncle Aldimir appears to have entered into negotiations with the Byzantines, and Theodore Svetoslav annexed his uncle's lands. In 1306 Theodore Svetoslav gained the services of the rebellious Alan mercenaries to the Byzantines, whom he settled in Bulgaria, and made unsuccessful overtures to the mercenaries of the Catalan Company, who had also rebelled against their Byzantine employers. The war ended with a peace treaty in 1307, cemented with a marriage between the widowed Theodore Svetoslav and Theodora, a daughter of the Co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos. A copper coin of Theodore Svetoslav. Until the end of his life Theodore Svetoslav remained at peace with his neighbors. His reassertion of central control over outlying provinces such as Vidin was probably peaceful, and the sparsely documented recovery of the banate of Severin from the Kingdom of Hungary must have been achieved during the dynastic struggles in that country. In 1318 the Serbian King Stefan Uro≈° II Milutin visited TƒÉrnovo, in spite of his earlier alliance with Andronikos II and his divorce from Theodore Svetoslav's sister Anna. The only possible sign of new hostilities are two Mongol raids into Byzantine Thrace in 1320 and 1321, but these were probably executed with Bulgarian cooperation and are connected with the beginning of the civil war between Andronikos II Palaiologos and his grandson Andronikos III Palaiologos. In fact, Theodore Svetoslav sent military support to his brother-in-law Andronikos III, allegedly hoping to ensnare and capture his ally. After a surprisingly successful reign (given the misadventures of his youth), Theodore Svetoslav died in early 1322, and was succeeded by his son George Terter II. Family By his first wife Euphrosyne (Efrosina), Theodore Svetoslav had one son, George Terter II, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria from 1322 to 1323. It is not known if he had children by his second wife Theodora Palaiologina, daughter of Emperor Michael IX Palaiologos.

It is possible that he was associated as co-emperor by his father in 1321, but the sources are unclear. After his father's death in 1322, he became actively involved in the civil war in the Byzantine Empire, in which the throne was being contested between Andronikos II Palaiologos and his grandson Andronikos III Palaiologos. Taking advantage of the situation, George Terter II invaded Byzantine Thrace and, encountering little, if any, resistance, conquered the major city of Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and part of the surrounding area in 1322. A Bulgarian garrison was installed under the command of a general named Ivan the Russian, and a court scribe praised George Terter II as a \\"possessor of the Bulgarian and the Greek sceptre\\". A new campaign later the same year brought the subjugation of several fortresses around Adrianople, but the Bulgarians were now turned back and defeated by Andronikos III.

History Religion grew to become a highly respected part of slave life. It offered the enslaved hope and reassurance.

The meetings were held after dark, once field and house chores were completed, and carried on late into the night. Christianity was the prominent religion of the African Slaves after being transported to the Americas. After being exposed to Christian ideas, the slaves began to understand them more. Slaves discovered promising stories and passages in the Bible that offered hope. The story of Jesus Christ suffering on the cross drew attention because of the similar, harsh treatment they both received. The hush harbors served as the location where slaves could combine their African religious traditions with Christianity. It was safe to freely blend the components of each religion in these meetings. The slaves could let go of all their hardships and express their emotions. Here is where Negro spirituals originated. The songs created by slaves were known to contain a double meaning, revealing the ideas of religious salvation and freedom from slavery. The meetings would also include practices such as dance. African shouts and rhythms were also included. Slaves would suffer punishments had they been caught in a hush harbor meeting. Slave owners were confident that they would compare treatment, working conditions, and punishments, leaving them worried about revolts and riots.

Born in peaceful times, when the Southern Slavs were subjects of the Byzantine Empire, his father was in 1072 approached by Bulgarian nobility, who sought aid in their revolt against the Byzantines; Mihailo sent them Bodin, who was crowned Bulgarian tsar under the name Petar III (, Pet≈≠r III)Yordan Andreev - \\"Bulgarian khans and tsars VII-XIV century. Historical chronological reference book\\", State Publishing House \\"Dr. Petar Beron\\", Sofia, 1988, p.98 joined the short-lived revolt, being captured the following year after initial success. He was freed in 1078, and upon the death of his father in 1081 he succeeded to the throne of Dioclea. Having renewed his acknowledgement of Byzantine overlordship, he soon sided with their enemies, the Normans, which resulted in a Byzantine invasion and his capture. Although he quickly had himself freed, his reputation and influence waned. He was pushed aside into by one of his governors, Vukan, who continued the struggle against the Byzantines. Early life Bodin was the son of Mihailo, the ÀùKing of the SlavsÀù, who held the Byzantine title of protospatharios. His mother was the niece of Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (r. 1042‚Äì1055). His father was more of a politician and statesman than warrior. Energetic and ambitious, Bodin was brought up in a period when the state enjoyed rare peace for two decades, although this did not interfere with his development of warrior qualities and abilities. He participated in the large revolt that broke out in Pomoravlje and Povardarje against the Byzantines in 1072‚Äì73. Uprising against the Byzantines (1072‚Äì73) The themata of the Byzantine Empire, at the death of Basil II in 1025. Mihailo was approached by Bulgarian nobles (proechontes) led by Georgi Voyteh, who asked for a son whom they could crown as their emperor and end Byzantine \\"oppression\\". In the fall of 1072, Mihailo obliged and sent Bodin with 300 troops to Prizren, where they met with Georgi Voiteh, the exarch of Skopje, and other magnates. They proclaimed him emperor of the Bulgarians and renamed him Petar. It is theorized that Bodin was the great-grandson of Samuel of Bulgaria. Bodin was thus put at the command of the Bulgarian Slavs against the Byzantines (Greeks). The revolt, fought by the \\"Slavic people\\" (according to Bryennios) broke out in the theme of Bulgaria. It is possible that it was aided by the Hungarians. The aid to Georgi Voiteh moved Mihailo away from the Byzantines. In the meantime, the Byzantine doux of Skopje, Nikephoros Karantenos, marched towards Prizren with an army, but was replaced prior to the battle with Damian Dalassenos, who destroyed the morale of the army that would fight the Serbian contingent. The Serb army in Kosovo was split into two groups that would organize the uprising: the first was led by Bodin and operated in Pomoravlje, heading for Ni≈°, while his second-in-command Vojvoda Petrilo operated in Povardarje, heading for Kastoria via Ohrid. Petrilo headed south and took Ohrid without a battle, and then Devol, but suffered a defeat at Kastoria, where Byzantine Slavic Boris David commanded a Bulgarian contingent and defeated Petrilo, sending him fleeing \\"through inaccessible mountains\\". The troops of Bodin took Ni≈° and started plundering the region, abusing his 'subjects', which was seen by Voiteh as Bodin being greedier than Michael VII, and when the Byzantines under Saronites marched onto Skopje, Bodin showed no concern, making Voiteh surrender without resistance. A Byzantine garrison was installed at Skopje, and Saronites headed for Ni≈°. In order to prevent the retreat to Zeta being cut off, Bodin also retreated from Ni≈°, but clashed with the Byzantines in Kosovo, where he was defeated and captured. Despite some initial success Bodin was captured at Pauni in southern Kosovo, and then sent to Constantinople, then Antioch, where he spent several years. Voiteh died en route. When Mihailo heard of the capture of his son, he sent his son-in-law and former captive, the Byzantine general Longibardopoulos, to rescue Bodin, but instead, Longibardopoulos upon arriving defected to the Byzantines. When unrest began in Antioch, Mihailo paid some Venetian merchants who freed Bodin and took him home. Upon his return, it seems, Bodin became a co-ruler of his father. Co- rule Soon after his return, the Byzantines attacked, forcing Mihailo and Bodin to temporarily acknowledge Byzantine overlordship. When, in 1081, the Normans crossed from Italy and attacked the Byzantines and besieged Dyrrhachion, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos went against them and called Bodin for aid. Bodin arrived with a Serb detachment; however, during the Battle of Dyrrhachion (18 October), he stayed aside with his army, intending to await the outcome of the battle. When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee, Bodin retreated with his army. Reign Seal of Constantine Bodin. State of Constantine Bodin. After the death of King Mihailo, Bodin inherited the Dukljan throne. By this time Bodin was a mature man with a turbulent background and great experiences, also having been a co-ruler of his father for several years. Bodin's disengagement at Dyrrhachion outraged Constantinople, relations further deteriorating when Bodin began fully supporting the Normans. The Byzantines, after dealing with the Normans, attacked Bodin, defeated him and once again had him imprisoned. He quickly had himself freed, but after this his reputation began to fall and influence to wane. Church of Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople. The focus of the Serbian national and state life were then transmitted in the 1090s to the mountains of Kopaonik, where his subject, ≈æupan (count) Vukan, played the most important role in the fight of the Serbs against the Byzantine Empire. Bodin was pushed to the background, contributed by the dynastic conflicts and his struggle against the Republic of Ragusa, which brought him only little fame and success. Thus, Bodin, who had started his career with much enthusiasm and energy, ended his life and reign without power and reputation. By 1085, he and his brothers had suppressed a revolt by their cousins, the sons of Mihailo's brother Radoslav in the ≈æupa of Zeta, and Bodin then ruled unchallenged. In spite of his earlier opposition to the Byzantine Empire, Bodin at first supported the Byzantines against the attack of Robert Guiscard and his Normans on Durazzo in 1081, but then stood idle, allowing the Normans to take the city. At about this time, Bodin married Jaquinta, the daughter of Argyritzos, a nobleman from Bari forced into exile in Duklja. Constantine Bodin's relations with the west included his support for Pope Urban II in 1089, which secured him a major concession, the upgrading of his bishop of Bar to the rank of an archbishop. Despite Bodin's submission to Rome, the Catholic Church only gained ground in coastal areas of his realm, while the inland parts remained under Constantinople. Constantine Bodin attempted to maintain the enlarged realm left him by his father. To do so, he campaigned in Bosnia and Rascia, installing his relative Stephen as ban in Bosnia and his nephews Vukan and Marko as ≈æupans in Rascia. The two brothers were sons of Constantine Bodin's half-brother Petrislav, who had governed Ra≈°ka in 1060‚Äì1074. However, after the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085, Constantine Bodin was faced by the hostility of the Byzantine Empire, which recovered Durazzo and prepared to punish the king of Duklja for siding with the Normans. The Byzantine campaign against Duklja is dated between 1089 and 1091 and may have succeeded in taking Bodin captive for the second time. Although the kingdom survived, outlying territories including Bosnia, Rascia, and Hum seceded under their own governors. Exactly what happened in Duklja is unknown, and there may have been a civil war during Bodin's possible captivity. Queen Jaquinta ruthlessly persecuted possible claimants to the throne, including Bodin's cousin Branislav and his family. After a number of these persons were killed or exiled by Bodin and his wife, the church managed to keep the impending blood feud from sparking off a full-blown civil war.

It is available in combination with other drugs such as paracetamol (acetominophen). Common use Phenyltoloxamine is widely used in preparations as an enhancing agent for some analgesics and antitussives (acetaminophen, dihydrocodeine, codeine, hydrocodone). It is widely used in certain parts of the world as cough suppressant usually with codeine, and sometimes by itself or in addition to dextromethorphan as it, like diphenhydramine, possesses antitussive action of its own and is particularly useful in semi-productive coughs because of its moderate drying action. Phenyltoloxamine has analgesic and anti-spasmodic properties of its own and is used in combination with paracetamol, aspirin and other salicylates and other drugs in proprietary preparations available over the counter for backache, muscle strains and similar conditions. In this respect, it is similar to a closely related antihistamine, orphenadrine, and both drugs are very closely related to diphenhydramine and to doxylamine, the latter of which is the active ingredient in NyQuil and many other cough preparations. Phenyltoloxamine is one of the more effective potentiators of codeine and derivatives such as ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, oxycodone, nicocodeine, hydrocodone and similar drugs like tramadol and propoxyphene for all indications, pain relief and cough suppression in particular. Phenyltoloxamine, like diphenhydramine and doxylamine, is an effective non- narcotic anti-tussive on its own but tends to be effective only for productive coughs as the anticholinergic action will exacerbate dry, unproductive coughs, so it is often combined with dextromethorphan, codeine, ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, or hydrocodone in cough suppressants both over the counter and prescription. It is also used to discourage abuse in certain opiate analgesics due to its unpleasant side effects at high doses. While therapeutic doses of phenyltoloxamine can generate mild to moderate euphoria as can many of its close chemical relatives, much higher doses have a side effect profile similar to that of atropine, which is also used in this fashion for tablets of diphenoxylate and morphine for oral administration.  Adverse effects  Common adverse effects are those associated with most anticholinergics, with effects being more pronounced in children and the elderly.  Availability  Though it is rare in several Western countries, phenyltoloxamine is widely used on the global scale, particularly in the developing world. In the past it was not a controlled substance. It was taken off the market but is available OTC again in the US by some pharmaceutical companies. Some preparations contain opiates such as codeine or hydrocodone and are controlled. When used in preparations with acetaminophen it is generally over the counter.

One of the minor characters, Sir Andrew is a stereotypical fool, who is goaded into unwisely duelling with Cesario and who is slowly having his money pilfered by Sir Toby Belch. He is dim-witted, vain and clownish. His role in the play not only provides comedy through his pathetic situation and his long speech, but also by his distinct, long-faced appearance and garish dress sense. The role has been a favourite for noted actors such as Alec Guinness, Christopher Plummer, Paul Scofield and Roger Rees. Background and character Sir Andrew first appears in the third scene of Act I, as the so-called friend of Sir Toby Belch. Sir Andrew is a guest at the home of Sir Toby's niece Lady Olivia, where Sir Toby, a drunkard and glutton, resides. Although we are not made aware of Sir Andrew's family or connections, it is said that his annual income is 3,000 ducats, a significant amount and roughly equal to that of a skilled craftsman of the period, leading us to assume that he is a gentleman of some leisure. Ineptly, Sir Andrew attempts to court Olivia, and her rejection of him, in favour of dashing Cesario, prompts Sir Andrew to challenge Cesario to a duel. His slow-witted nature allows Sir Toby perfect opportunity to take advantage of him, openly admitting that by misusing Sir Andrew's generosity and gullibility, he has milked him for approximately two-thirds of his stated income. Sir Andrew fancies himself a great dancer and swordsman, and the scenes where he ineptly engages in these activities are points of physical comedy in the play. Sir Andrew's age is not made clear, but it is assumed that he is a number of years younger than Sir Toby. Sir Andrew and Malvolio are probably the only characters whose situation at the end of the play is not as favourable as in the beginning. Amongst three happy couples and a humiliated Malvolio in the final scene, Sir Andrew has already made his closing exit, following Sir Toby's open insults toward him. Friendless and deep in debt, this ending echoes one of Sir Andrew's better known lines, from the third scene of the second act: \\"I was adored once too.\\" The negative outcome for Sir Andrew, combined with his having been the subject of jokes and Sir Toby's greed, is a strain of melancholy in an otherwise comical play. As one of the central supporting roles in Twelfth Night, Sir Andrew's character speaks a total of 88 lines and appears in seven of the eighteen scenes. Noted performances The Elizabethan actor John Sinklo has been associated with the role of Sir Andrew.\\" Actors who have distinguished themselves in the role of Sir Andrew include Alec Guinness, Paul Scofield, Juan Garibay, Christopher Plummer and Richard E. Grant. Mr Grant excelled in Trevor Nunn's movie adaptation of Twelfth Night: dancing dreadfully in front of Mel Smith's Sir Toby, getting his sword caught in a branch of a tree and being kicked in the groin during his duel with \\"Cesario\\" (Imogen Stubbs). When Maria (Imelda Staunton) tricks Malvolio (Nigel Hawthorne) into wearing yellow stockings, she reveals to her fellow conspirators that \\"'tis a colour [my lady Olivia] abhors\\". They then turn to Sir Andrew who is wearing a yellow waistcoat, tie and stockings. At the end however, he is allowed some dignity by kissing the hand of Olivia (Helena Bonham Carter) before leaving her estate, his head held high. Quotes *but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.' (1.3.70) : Sir Andrew explains himself.See Robert Appelbaum, Aguecheek's Beef, Belch's Hiccup, and Other Gastronomic Interjections (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006). *Nay, let me alone for swearing (3.4.183) :Sir Andrew's boast that he is an expert at cursing. *He does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural (2.3.83) :Sir Andrew Aguecheek compares his fooling with that of Sir Toby Belch. *I was adored once too (2.3.171) :The reference of this quote is unclear, but indicates sadness underneath his carefree and idiotic nature.

She is the daughter of underground comix artists Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky-Crumb. Crumb was born in Woodland, California, US and lived in the nearby farming town of Winters with her parents until she was nine years old. In 1991, she relocated with her family to Sauve, a village in the south of France. Her parents reported that they wanted to remove her from the political conservatives and Christian fundamentalists of the United States. In a 2010 interview, Sophie told The Philadelphia Inquirer that her mother was afraid Sophie would \\"turn into a Valley girl\\". After this relocation Terry Zwigoff released Crumb (1994), a documentary film about her father and their family. Zwigoff later commissioned Sophie to prepare some original drawings for inclusion in his 2001 comedy-drama, Ghost World, an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' comics serial of the same name. After completing her secondary education in France, Crumb studied acrobatics and clowning at a French circus school. While living in Brooklyn in the mid-2000s she sold her comics on the street and apprenticed herself to a tattoo artist. At another stage she earned a living by teaching English as a foreign language. She lives in the south of France with her husband (a construction worker) and their son, Eli, who was born in 2009. Published work When she was a child, Crumb's parents published some of her drawings in their comics anthology, Weirdo; she later contributed to their comic book series Dirty Laundry Comics, originally published from 1977 to 1992. Crumb illustrated a sketchbook for the American film Ghost World (2001). Her drawings were meant to reflect the personality and inner life of Enid (Thora Birch), the film's protagonist. In 2002, Fantagraphics Books and Oog & Blik published Crumb's first comic book, Belly Button, followed by Belly Button Comix #2 in 2004. She contributed multiple pieces to installments of Mome published between 2005 and 2008. Her development as a graphic artist are documented in Sophie Crumb: Evolution of a Crazy Artist (W.W. Norton 2010). Her debut solo show, which featured more than 20 drawings and gicl√©e prints, coincided with the book's publication. The show ran from 4 November to 30 December 2010 at DCKT Contemporary, Dennis Christie and Ken Tyburski's contemporary art gallery in New York City.

The date of his birth is unknown. Life Although Smilec is credited with being descended \\"from the noblest family of the Bulgarians\\", his antecedents are completely unknown. Judging by the landholdings of his brothers Radoslav and Vojsil, the family held extensive lands between the Balkan mountains and Sredna Gora. Before ascending the throne replacing George Terter I in 1292, Smilec had married an unnamed Byzantine princess, the daughter of the sebastokrat≈çr Constantine Palaiologos, a half-brother of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Apart from the information that Smilec became emperor of Bulgaria according to the wishes of Nogai Khan, we know nothing of the circumstances of Smilec's accession. He was crowned by Patriarch Joachim III. Joachim III was executed for treason in 1300 by emperor Theodore Svetoslav, George Terter I's son, and historian John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. theorizes that the alleged treachery might be linked to the obscure period when Smilets overthrew George Terter I. The reign of Smilec has been considered the height of Mongol overlordship in Bulgaria. Nevertheless, Mongol raids may have continued, as in 1297 and 1298. Since these raids pillaged parts of Thrace (then entirely in Byzantine hands), perhaps Bulgaria was not one of their objectives. In fact, in spite of the usually pro-Byzantine policy of Nogai, Smilec was quickly involved in an unsuccessful war against the Byzantine Empire at the beginning of his reign. About 1296/1297 Smilec married his daughter Theodora to the future Serbian King Stefan Uro≈° III Deƒçanski, and this union produced the Serbian king and later emperor Stefan Uro≈° IV Du≈°an. In 1298 Smilec disappears from the pages of history, apparently after the beginning of Chaka's invasion. He may have been killed by Chaka or died of natural causes while the enemy advanced against him. Smilec was briefly succeeded by his young son Ivan II. Smilets Point in Antarctica is named after Smilets of Bulgaria. Family Smilec was married to an unnamed Byzantine princess, daughter of sebastokrat≈çr Constantine Palaiologos.

The reign of George Terter I represents a continuation of Bulgaria's precipitous decline during the second half of the 13th century. Although George Terter I managed to maintain himself on the throne for more than a decade (unlike his two immediate predecessors), he appears to have failed to assert himself against the centrifugal forces even in his own capital. This severely limited any possibility of engaging in grand-scale international politics or even standing up to foreign aggression and Mongol raids. During the chaotic years preceding George Terter I's accession Bulgaria had lost all of Thrace to the Byzantine Empire, and under his reign its remaining possessions in Macedonia were divided between the Serbians and the Byzantines in 1282‚Äì1284. Early life The antecedents of George Terter I are unclear, but the Byzantine sources testify that he was of Bulgarian and Cuman descent, something corroborated by his double name, which recalls the name of the Cuman clan Terteroba. George Terter I had at least one brother, named Aldimir (Eltimir), who was made a despotƒìs by either his older brother or by the regency for Ivan II. When Ivan Asen III became emperor at TƒÉrnovo in 1279 during the Uprising of Ivaylo, he sought to strengthen his position by allying himself with George Terter. The latter divorced his first wife Maria, who was sent together with their son Theodore Svetoslav as a hostage to the Byzantine Empire, to marry Maria (Kira Maria), the sister of Ivan Asen III. George Terter was accordingly made a despotƒìs, the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy. Rule as Emperor Bulgaria in the second half of the 13th century. Darker orange shows the Empire under George I Terter. The continued success of Ivaylo against Byzantine reinforcements led Ivan Asen III to flee the capital and escape to the Byzantine Empire, while George Terter I seized power as emperor in 1280. With the threat from Ivaylo and Ivan Asen III removed, George Terter I made an alliance with King Charles I of Sicily, with Stefan Dragutin of Serbia, and with Thessaly against Michael VIII Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire in 1281. The alliance failed as Charles was distracted by the Sicilian Vespers and the secession of Sicily in 1282, while Bulgaria was ravaged by the Mongols of the Golden Horde under Nogai Khan. Seeking Serbian support, George Terter I engaged his daughter Anna to the Serbian king Stefan Uro≈° II Milutin in 1284. Since the death of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1282, George Terter I re-opened negotiations with the Byzantine Empire and sought the return of his first wife. This was eventually accomplished by treaty, and the two Marias exchanged places as empress and hostage. Theodore Svetoslav also returned to Bulgaria after a successful mission of Patriarch Joachim III and was made co-emperor by his father, but after another Mongol invasion in 1285, he was sent off as a hostage to Nogai Khan. Theodore Svetoslav's other sister, Helena, was also sent to the Horde, where she married Nogai's son Chaka. Exile and death For unknown reasons, though possibly under Mongol pressure, George Terter I sought refuge in the Byzantine Empire in 1292. The Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos at first refused to receive him, perhaps fearing complications with the Mongols, and George Terter was kept waiting in wretched conditions in the vicinity of Adrianople. The former Bulgarian emperor was eventually sent to live in Anatolia. George Terter I passed the next decade of his life in obscurity. In 1301 his son Theodore Svetoslav, already emperor of Bulgaria, defeated a Byzantine army and captured thirteen high-ranking officers, whom he exchanged for his father. In Bulgaria George Terter I was not associated in power by his son, but he was confined to luxurious life in a city chosen by his son. An inscription from a rock-cut church near Ivanovo laconically mentions the death of \\"emperor Gergi\\" in the year 1308/1309. Family George Terter I was married twice. By his first wife, a Bulgarian named Maria, he had two children: # Theodore Svetoslav, emperor of Bulgaria 1300‚Äì1322 # Elena, married to Chaka, emperor of Bulgaria 1299‚Äì1300. By his second wife, Maria (Kira Maria) of Bulgaria, sister of Ivan Asen III, George Terter had one daughter: # Ana Terter, who married first Stefan Uro≈° II Milutin of Serbia, and then Demetrios Doukas Komnenos Koutroules.

The exact year of his birth is unknown but it was between 1280 and 1292. He was the founder of the last ruling dynasty of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Shishman dynasty. After he was crowned, however, Michael used the name Asen to emphasize his connection with the Asen dynasty, the first one to rule over the Second Empire. An energetic and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, which ended in the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans and the last one who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.Kazhdan, \\"Michael III ≈†i≈°man\\", p. 1365 Rise to the throne Born between 1280–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 255 and 1292 Michael Shishman was the son of the despot Shishman of Vidin by an unnamed daughter of the sebastokrator Peter and Anna (Theodora), herself daughter of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218-1241) and Irene Komnene of Epirus. He was also a distant cousin of his predecessors on the Bulgarian throne, Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300-1321) and George Terter II (r. 1321-1322). After the peace between his father and Stefan Milutin in 1292, Michael Shishman was engaged to Milutin's daughter Anna Neda and they married in 1298 or 1299.Fine, p. 268 Since the middle of the 13th century, the area of Vidin had been autonomous under ineffective Bulgarian overlordship, and was ruled successively by Yakov Svetoslav (died 1276), Shishman (died between 1308 and 1313), and then Michael Shishman. Shishman and his son received the high courtly title of despotƒìs from their cousin Theodore Svetoslav and the latter was referred to in a contemporary Venetian source as a Despot of Bulgaria and Lord of Vidin. With the death of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, Michael Shishman was able to follow a more active policy in the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo. He soon became a leading noble in the internal affairs of the country and, on the childless death of young George Terter II in 1323, Michael Shishman was elected emperor of Bulgaria by the nobility.Fine, pp. 268‚Äì269 According to some historians he was chosen because he was a descendant of the Asen dynasty and interpret his ascencion to the throne not as the beginning of a new dynasty but rather as a continuation of the House of Asen.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, –ì—é–∑–µ–ª–µ–≤, p. 562 His half-brother, Belaur, succeeded him as despot of Vidin.Fine, p. 269 Relations with the Byzantine Empire =War against Byzantium= Bulgaria during the rule of Michael Shishman. The sudden death of George Terter II had been followed by a brief period of confusion and uncertainty, which was exploited by the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. The Byzantines overran northeastern Thrace and captured a number of important cities including Yambol, Lardea, Ktenia, Rusokastro, Anchialus, Sozopol and Agatopol. At the same time, a Byzantine-sponsored pretender, Voysil, brother of the former Bulgarian emperor Smilets (r. 1292-1298), ensconced himself in KrƒÉn, controlling the valleys between the Balkan mountains and Sredna Gora from Sliven to Kopsis.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 256 At this point the newly elected Michael Shishman marched south against Andronikos III, while another Byzantine army led by Andronikos III himself was besieging Philippopolis (Plovdiv).

However, Michael III who was informed of the conflict between Andronikos III and Andronikos II hinted him that he could help Andronikos III against his grandfather in case of war and returned to Bulgaria promising that soon he would begin negotiations. =Peace agreement and involvement in Byzantine civil war= On a council held in Constantinople on the relations with Bulgaria it was decided that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav.Fine, p. 270 The exact reasons for that act are unclear.

Deƒçanski, who was engaged in war against his cousin Stephen Vladislav II, was in no position to oppose Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor even acknowledged his rival as King of Serbia but his help to Vladislav was insufficient. In the spring of 1324 Deƒçanski sent the future Serbian archbishop Danilo II to negotiate with the Bulgarian emperor in Tarnovo but his mission was inconclusive. The two countries were again on the opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war when the Bulgarians allied with Andronikos III while the Serbs supported his grandfather.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, pp. 258‚Äì259Gregory, p. 305 After the agreement with Andronikos III in 1329, Michael Shishman started preparations to attack while the Serbs were pillaging the areas around Ohrid.

Backed on the agreement, Michael Shishman allowed his army to disperse in search for provisions. However, in the morning of 28 July, the main Serbian reinforcements, 1,000 heavily armed Catalan horsemen under the command of the King's son Stephen Du≈°an arrived, and the Serbs broke their word and attacked the Bulgarians.\\"Historia by John Kantakouzenos\\" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 265 Despite the unexpected assault, Michael Shishman tried to bring his army to order but it was too late and the Serbs were victorious. The outcome of the battle shaped the balance of power in the Balkans for the next decades to come and although Bulgaria did not lose territory, the Serbs could occupy much of Macedonia.Fine, p. 272 Death and legacy Church of St George where Michael Shishman was buried. The circumstances around the death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian John Kantakouzenos the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died while another Byzantine historian suggests that Michael Shishman lived for three more days not able to gain consciousness and died on the fourth day.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, pp. 263‚Äì264 The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body.

At the same time he was clearly forceful and energetic, overcoming and reversing Bulgaria's losses during the uncertainty that preceded his accession, and managing to maintain internal peace and security within Bulgaria during his short reign. Andreev calls him the most remarkable 14th- century Bulgarian monarch. According to Kantacouzenos he desired to expand the country from Byzantium to the Istros, i. e. from Constantinople to the Danube which makes him the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who effectively attempted to capture the Byzantine capital.

He was the eldest son of emperor Michael III Shishman and Anna Neda of Serbia, a daughter of King Stefan Uro≈° II Milutin of Serbia.Andreev, p. 266Anna Neda belonged to the Nemanjiƒá dynasty on her paternal side and to the Terter and Asen dynasties on her maternal side. Ivan Stephen was a descendant of the Terter dynasty, the Asen dynasty and the Shishman dynasty. After his father's ascension to the throne in 1323 Ivan Stefan was associated as co-emperor. When Michael III Shishman divorced Anna Neda to marry Theodora Palaiologina, the daughter of Byzantine emperor Michael IX Palaiologos, in 1324, Ivan Stefan was exiled along with his mother and brother in a monastery.Fine In the summer of 1330 he became emperor of Bulgaria with the help of his uncle Stephen Deƒçanski. After he was deposed in a coup d'√©tat by the Tarnovo nobility, he fled along with Anna Neda in the domains of his father's brother Belaur in Ni≈° and later to Dubrovnik. He was later expelled from there by Stephen Du≈°an under the pressure of Ivan Alexander. Ivan Stefan probably died in Naples. Accession to the throne During the battle of Velbazhd against the Serbs, emperor Michael III Shishman was wounded and died a few days later in captivity.Ivanov, pp. 132-134 On 2 August the Bulgarian boyars proposed peace to the Serbian king Stephen Deƒçanski.Burmov, p. 265 Stephen Deƒçanski met them in the area known as Mraka and accepted the proposal and agreed that Ivan Stephen should become emperor of Bulgaria, thus abandoning the idea of uniting the two countries under the sceptre of his son Stephen Du≈°an. However, less than a year later, Deƒçanski was deposed and exiled to the Zveƒçan Fortress where he died. After the agreement of Mraka was reached, Anna Neda her sons were informed to go to the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo. Ivan Stephen entered the city and was proclaimed emperor in the second half of August 1330. Although he was in his early 30s, Ivan Stephen ruled together with his mother; the reasons for that are unknown. Byzantine response After Ivan Stephen took the throne, the second wife of Michael Shishman Theodora Palaiologina was forced to leave the capital along with her sons and departed to Constantinople, to her brother the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos.Gregoras, p. 457 After the news on the changes in Tarnovo reached Andronikos III he summoned his council and decided to abandon the war against Serbia and turn the Byzantine army to the weakened Bulgaria. The Byzantine emperor covered the attack on his former ally pointing that he would defend the rights of his sister and her children for the Bulgarian throne. When his troops were prepared in Macedonia, Andronikos III invaded Bulgarian Thrace in the summer of 1330. The towns of Anchialus (Pomorie), Messembria (Nessebar), Aetos (Aytos), Kteniya, Rusokastro and Diampolis (Yambol) surrendered without fighting and the hostilities ceased.Gregoras, pp. 457-458 Dethronement and later life During his rule Ivan Stephen was supported only by his uncle Belaur, while the rest of the nobility considered him a prot√©g√© of Deƒçanski and remained hostile.Burmov, p. 270 As a result of the discontent with the new government at the failures against the Byzantines, in March 1331 the protovestiarios Rascin and the logothete Philip organized a successful coup. The despot of Lovech Ivan Alexander was chosen as emperor of Bulgaria.Burmov, p. 272 Ivan Stephen fled with his mother and his brother to Ni≈°, in the lands of Belaur, where they stayed for a year and a half.Gregoras, p. 458-459 In 1332 he and his mother moved to Dubrovnik while his brothers went to the Golden Horde, where his brother Shishman sought support from the Mongols and from the Byzantine Empire, but his efforts also came to nothing. There is no certain information on his later life. According to Detlev Schwennicke Ivan Stephen went with his mother to southern Italy where he married the illegitimate daughter of Philip I, prince of Tar–∞nto, but did not have children. In 1342 he was with the future Byzantine emperor John VI Kantakouzenos during his escape from Constantinople. Twenty years later he was in a prison in Siena and seemed to have died in Naples in 1373. Schwennicke also wrote that Ivan Stephen could have perished in 1373 at a battle near Slobitza (modern name Slobozia).Schwennicke, p. 172 References Sources  *Gregoras, Nicephorus.

Beginning as one of the two radio networks owned by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the independent Blue Network was born of a divestiture in 1942, arising from antitrust litigation, and is the direct predecessor of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)‚Äîorganized 1943‚Äì1945 as a separate independent radio network and later TV broadcaster.  Early history  The Blue Network dates to 1923, when the Radio Corporation of America acquired WJZ Newark from Westinghouse, which had established the station in 1921.In a publication dated June 1943, the Blue Network itself traced its origins back to the founding of WJZ, as that eventually became the key station of the network. \\"The Blue Network Today\\", Blue Network Company, Inc. (New York, 1943), page 1 WJZ moved to New York City in May of that year. When RCA commenced operations of WRC, Washington on August 1, 1923, the root of a network was born, though it did not operate under the name by which it would later become known. Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod said it was not until 1924 that the \\"Radio Group\\" formally began network operations. The core stations of the \\"Radio Group\\" were RCA's stations WJZ and WRC; the Westinghouse station WBZ, then in Springfield, Massachusetts; and WGY, the General Electric station in Schenectady, New York. RCA's principal rival prior to 1926 was the radio broadcasting department of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. In 1921 AT&T; began using this department as a test-bed for equipment being designed and manufactured by its Western Electric subsidiary. The RCA stations operated at a significant disadvantage to their rival chain. AT&T; used its own high-quality transmission lines, and declined to lease them out to competing entities, forcing RCA to use the telegraph lines of Western Union, which were not as well calibrated to voice transmission as the AT&T; lines. Nevertheless, the WJZ network sought to compete toe-to-toe with the AT&T; network, which was built around a different New York station, WEAF (today's WFAN). For example, both stations sent announcer teams to cover the 1924 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City.For a colourful description of the radio coverage of this convention by WEAF and WJZ, as well as a reference to the Western Union lines, see Promotional material produced in 1943 claimed certain \\"firsts\\" in broadcasting by WJZ, such as the first educational music program in April 1922, the first World Series broadcasts in 1922, and the first complete opera broadcast, The Flying Dutchman, from the Manhattan Opera House.\\"The Blue Network Today\\", page 2; it is noteworthy that RCA, then still owner of the Blue Network, gives the credit to itself, and not to Westinghouse, the actual owner at that time.  Creation  NBC networks, 1933 RCA (as well as its consortium partners General Electric and Westinghouse)GE and Westinghouse, aside from owning radio stations that were in the \\"Radio Group\\" such as KYW and WGY, also owned a controlling interest in RCA. This controlling interest was sold in 1932, in the wake of action by the antitrust division of the Department of Justice. Time magazine, November 28, 1932 Big Pool Punned received a break in 1926, when AT&T; made a corporate decision to exit the broadcasting business and focus on its telecommunications business. The first step by AT&T; was to create the Broadcasting Company of America on May 15, 1926, to hold its broadcasting assets, which included WEAF and WCAP in Washington. As reported in the press, this move was due to the growth in the radio broadcasting activities of AT&T; and the special issues related thereto,The Iowa City Press-Citizen, May 15, 1926, 3:2, at Newspaper Archive though it would appear that subsequent activities in disposing of the assets of BCA may have also played a role in the decision. AT&T; did in fact subsequently sell WEAF to RCA for $1 million in July 1926,New York Times, July 22, 1926, 1:2 a price that newspaper reports indicated was a substantial premium over what other stations were commanding in the marketplace,Oakland Tribune, September 13, 1926, 12:6 and represented a recognition of the status of WEAF in broadcasting, as well as its access to AT&T;'s lines. Indeed, the negotiations for the sale may have taken place very shortly after the creation of BCA, as Folder 129 in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress contains a contract of sale for WEAF dated July 1, 1926.See , hereinafter referred to by folder number. The Oakland Tribune stated that 4/5ths of the purchase price of WEAF could be attributed to goodwill and the line access.Oakland Tribune, September 13, 1926, 12:6 Newspaper Archive On July 28, 1926, the Washington Post reported in a front- page story that RCA had acquired WCAP. The Oakland Tribune reported the same dayOakland Tribune, July 28, 1926, 12:6 that WCAP had departed the field, and WRC would be operating on the frequency they had shared, which was 640 AM. As part of the reorganization of the broadcasting assets in the wake of the acquisitions, on September 13, 1926, the formation of the National Broadcasting Company was announced via newspaper advertisements, and on November 15, 1926 NBC's first broadcast was made. This first broadcast on November 15, 1926 marked NBC's de facto formation of the NBC Red Network from the WEAF network assets, using WEAF as the \\"key station\\"; this network in eventual popular image tended to broadcast the most popular entertainment programming. RCA merged its former radio operations into NBC, and on January 1, 1927, WJZ became the \\"key station\\" of the Blue Network when its network switch operations began. The network, again in eventual popular image, tended to place its focus more on news and public affairs programming, as well as the \\"sustaining\\", or non-sponsored shows. The Decatur Review (Illinois) for Sunday, December 12, 1926 reported the following in an article describing a broadcast to be sponsored by the Victor Talking Machine Company and aired the following New Year's Day, January 1, 1927, which is a description of this first Blue Network broadcast‚Äînote that it makes it clear that January 1, 1927 marked the debut of the Blue Network: > \\"TWO BIG NETWORKS: The network to be used for the first concert will consist > of a combination of chains of stations affiliated with WEAF and WJZ, New > York.

There are two early examples, from the biggest news events of 1927. On May 20, 1927, both of the NBC networks covered the return of Charles Lindbergh to America from his trans-Atlantic flight, star announcer Graham McNamee doing the honors. Three months later, a combined hookup of 67 stations on the two networks presented the second Dempsey‚ÄìTunney fight, broadcast by McNamee and NBC colleague Phillips Carlin. See Elizabeth McLeod's discussion of surviving NBC broadcast material from this era. Advertisement placed by the Enna Jettick Shoe Company promoting the appearance of Sir Harry Lauder on its NBC Blue program, December 1, 1929. Note that the text implies that the NBC Blue, NBC Orange (West Coast) and NBC Red networks were all participating in the broadcast. A slightly later example of cooperation came on the evening of Sunday, December 1, 1929, when the famed \\"Laird of the Music Halls\\", Sir Harry Lauder, appeared on a coast-to-coast hookup that originated from KFI in Los Angeles (later an NBC Red station, but at this time part of NBC's West Coast \\"Orange Network\\"), but was distributed by WJZ, which, as noted, was the key station of the Blue Network; advertisements suggest that certain NBC Red stations, as well as stations in the Orange Network, supplemented the network. A description of this broadcast is contained in a 1930 pamphlet put out by the Enna Jettick Shoe Company;\\"Favorite Songs, Published by Enna Jettick Shoes\\" (New York, 1930 (?)), in the collection of E.O. Costello Enna Jettick sponsored the first of Lauder's performances that night on its \\"Enna Jettick Melodies\\" show, which was followed later by another performance during the time ordinarily used by The Collier Hour.Lima (Ohio) Sunday News, December 1, 1929, 2:7‚Äì8, available at Newspaper Archive. At least as late as January 1939, in spite of the fact that by this time NBC was seeking to differentiate the images of its NBC Red and NBC Blue networks (see below), it would still arrange for special, joint broadcasts, such as a special two-hour presentation of \\"The Magic Key of RCA\\" musical program (normally an NBC Blue program, sponsored by RCA's Victor records division) entitled \\"Salute to 1939.\\"Time, January 2, 1939 Programs Previewed; another slightly earlier example would be the March 5, 1938 joint Red‚ÄìBlue broadcast of the season's last concert of the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini. = Blue Network function through the mid-1930s = Ironically, even though the Blue Network generally was not given the more popular programs, it was the network that broadcast Amos 'n Andy at the height of its popularity in the early 1930s, when on average over half of the nation's radio audience would tune in to the show.A listing of the top-rated shows on NBC Blue can be found at , showing that Amos 'n Andy's rating of 53.4 in 1930‚Äì31 was far and away the best performance by an NBC Blue show; in fact, four of the top ten performing shows were Amos 'n Andy seasons. During the 1932‚Äì1933 season, Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) sponsored an unusual program, the Five-Star Theater, which each weeknight presented a show in a different format. The marquee show in this cycle was Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel, which starred Groucho Marx and Chico Marx. Considering the show's relatively early (7:30 p.m. ET) time slot, it did rather well in the ratings,In fact, as demonstrated by , it was the 19th best performance by *any* NBC Blue program during the period it was owned by NBC. but it could not compete with the much stronger ratings produced by Esso's arch-rival Texaco, which sponsored Ed Wynn on NBC Red, and the show ended after one year.The surviving scripts for this show, in addition to a discussion of the show's history and an interview with one of its chief writers, can be found in the book Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show, edited by Michael Barson (Pantheon Books, New York 1988). More commonly, the Blue Network would operate as a quasi-\\"farm team\\" for the Red Network, in terms of entertainment programs. Bob Hope (in 1935 and again in 1937), Jack Benny (in 1932), Fibber McGee and Molly (in 1935), and Information, Please! (in 1938) are all examples of shows that debuted on the Blue Network before eventually transitioning over to larger audiences on the Red Network.For the Hope, Benny and Information Please programs, consult , which show when these shows originated on NBC Blue; information confirming this, and adding Fibber McGee, came from Same Time, Same Station by Ron Lackmann (Facts on File, 1996). On occasion, shows would make brief stops at NBC Blue before moving elsewhere, such as the Lux Radio Theatre (1934‚Äì35) and Will Rogers' program (1933), both of which would move to CBS. AdvertisementSalt Lake Tribune, October 13, 1934, advertising the debut of the Lux Radio Theatre, which had a brief run on NBC Blue in 1934‚Äì35 before moving for a long run on CBS. At some level, the Blue Network was known in the late 1920s and early 1930s for its children's programming. There are at least two volumes extant, from an Akron-based publishing house,\\"Blue Network Stories For Children: A Collection of Stories Which Are Favorites With Children Over the Radio\\" (Saalfield Publishing Company, Akron, 1929) which are collections of stories which purport to have been part of Blue Network programs. A copy of one, in the collection of E.O. Costello, shows a cover with two children listening to a late 1920s-style radio, from which shimmering images of fairy- tale characters are emerging. Other than the title (and the radio on the cover), the precise nature of the ties to the Blue Network is not known; the book does not even make direct reference to the National Broadcasting Company. It can also be said that this is an indication that the Blue Network had a well-established identity of its own by 1929.There are also at least two other, similar books, also published by Saalfield, which reference the Red Network. Why volumes by the same publisher were produced with titles referring to both the Red and Blue Networks, and what the connection with NBC was, is not clear. Saalfield for most of the 20th century was a major publisher of children's books, and published other radio tie-ins; by way of colorful example, a set of paper dolls dating from 1943 and tied to the NBC program The Hour of Charm, with its all-girl orchestra, is known to exist. = Problems = The descriptions of the material contained in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress appear to indicate that at some level, there was discontent with the way NBC was managing the Blue Network vis-√†-vis the Red Network. For example, one folder in the NBC History FilesFolder 998 contains a three-page letter dated June 28, 1934, from station WSYR in Syracuse, New York, which complains of the neglect of the Blue Network in favor of the Red Network. This point can said to be reinforced firstly by a memorandum dated September 18, 1935,NBC History Files, Folder 784 in which the Blue complained about its lack of access to broadcasts of the World Series, and secondly by a letter dated shortly after that, on October 5, 1935,NBC History Files, Folder 299 which is a communication from Hearst Radio complaining that Amos 'n Andy and the Al Pearce programs had been moved from the Blue Network to the Red Network, and complaining in general about the weakness of the Blue's programming. Indeed, the NBC History Files containNBC History Files, Folder 431 a February 1937 in-house memorandum so caustic of the performance of the Blue Network that the author's name was redacted from the document. A significant issue with the NBC Blue Network may have been its size. It started, in January 1927, with 7 stations, had grown to 17 by the end of 1929, but still had only 33 stations by 1937.\\"The Blue Network Today\\", page 3. This would have made it significantly smaller than its rivals. In 1938, Mutual had 107 affiliates, and CBS had 114; the Blue Network, by contrast, was not able to blanket the United States when NBC Red sold out its time, with the result that during 1937‚Äì1938, the Blue Network's revenues were generally falling, while NBC Red's increased.Time, September 19, 1938 Money for Minutes Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has noted that as of 1938, NBC had 23 stations in its core \\"Basic Red\\" group, and 24 in its \\"Basic Blue\\" group, with 107 stations that could be Red or Blue depending on the needs of a sponsor;. Generally speaking, in this era NBC would offer a package built around a \\"basic\\" group of stations, with regional blocks added on depending on a sponsor's needs. An early example of this would be the above-referenced Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel program, which was not broadcast nationwide because Esso only sold its gasoline in certain markets, unlike Texaco, which sold gasoline nationwide and thus used a nationwide system to broadcast Ed Wynn. the relative ratings (and thus revenues) for NBC Red programs versus NBC Blue counterparts suggests that sponsors chose to use Red more often than Blue. = Image = Perhaps more in line with the common perception of the Blue Network as a smaller, but more high-brow and public affairs-centered networkA story in the October 2, 1948 edition of the Oneonta Star (New York) described a lecture given by a production manager at a local radio station, in which she described the NBC Red network as handling \\"commercial\\" programs, and the NBC Blue network as handling \\"sustained\\" programs. This is one example of how the networks were viewed, at least in retrospect. Oneonta Star (NY), October 2, 1948 2:6. was the fact that it was the original home of the NBC Symphony Orchestra broadcasts, led by Maestro Arturo Toscanini.See Lackmann, op cit. In a similar vein, one of the Blue Network's longest running programs was America's Town Meeting of the Air, a current-affairs discussion program.This show won Peabody Awards for the Blue Network for the Best Educational Program in 1943, and again in 1945; lists of Peabody Award winners can be found at Both Lowell Thomas and Walter Winchell's news programs were also broadcast over the Blue Network. Both of these shows were the Blue's highest rated programs in the late 1930s and early 1940s.See the ratings for NBC Blue at and In an interesting variation on the talent shows hosted by Major Bowes, the Sherwin-Williams paint company sponsored the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air for a number of years on Sunday afternoons in the 1930s and 1940s, in which singers competed for a chance to win contracts with the famed opera troupe.Time, April 10, 1939 Winners; by 1941, this show had moved to the Red Network. The National Farm and Home Hour, a show backed for many years by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was one of the Blue Network's standout daytime programs, and would be a part of its lineup from 1929 until March 1945, when the program shifted to NBC.see the description in Lackmann, op cit. Along with the NBC Symphony Orchestra broadcasts, the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts were part of the \\"crown jewels\\" of NBC Blue. A sober, dignified pamphlet issued by the network in 1937\\"Broadcasting the Metropolitan\\", NBC Blue Network, circa 1937; in the collection of E.O. Costello stated that the broadcasts were under RCA sponsorship, and \\"[t]hrough the medium of nationwide NBC Network broadcasting, Grand Opera has been given to the entire nation. No longer is it reserved for the privileged few ‚Äì now even the most isolated listeners throughout the United States are able to enjoy the world's finest music at their own firesides. The National Broadcasting Company (...) is proud to be the means of bringing the Metropolitan Opera to American radio listeners.\\" The pamphlet notes that 78 stations broadcast these opera performances in 1937, and that reception for the program was \\"nationwide\\", something moderately unusual for an NBC Blue broadcast. Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has suggested, aside from a brief period where NBC Red and NBC Blue had different chime-sequences in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the two networks were *not* differentiated for many years, which would certainly be consistent with the roster of shows described above. She points out, with some justice, that NBC Red also broadcast a number of high-brow programs such as The Voice of Firestone, The Atwater Kent Hour, and the Cities Service Concerts. Furthermore, she points out that until the 1936‚Äì1937 period, the \\"back office\\" support for the networks was the same,Compare, however, \\"The Blue Network Today\\", which cites later dates, 1939‚Äì1940, for the creation of separate departments for the Blue Network; \\"The Blue Network Today\\", page 4. and often stations would shift from one network to another, depending on sponsor needs.On this point, see also , discussing the need for chimes to tell a station serving both networks which feed to use It was only when the Federal Communications Commission began investigating network practices, McLeod believes, that efforts were made by RCA to differentiate the two networks, and to fully position NBC Blue as a high- brow/public affairs network. (In the same light, it has been suggested that the congressional pressure was the real reason the NBC Symphony Orchestra was created.)See McLeod's discussion at on all these points; with reference specifically to congressional pressure, see Lebrecht, Norman (2001). The Maestro Myth. Citadel Press, page 73, cited in NBC Symphony Orchestra. The NBC History Files at the Library of Congress lend support to the notion that NBC was gradually groping for a way to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network. For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated May 13, 1936, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations.NBC History Files, Folder 293 (Compare and contrast this with the way the Harry Lauder broadcast of 1929 was handled, above.) There also exists an October 1938 sales force memorandum, which contains talking points on how to differentiate the Blue Network from the Red Network and CBS.NBC History Files, Folder 128 Even as far back as December 1932, NBC had set forth a policy banning specific references not only to CBS, but even to the Red Network.NBC History Files, Folder 30 Of note is the fact that NBC began to step up efforts to expand the network; while it had 33 stations in 1937, this total had nearly tripled by January 1941, when the network had 92 stations coast to coast. These efforts to expand the network are evidenced by an NBC publication in late 1936, Great and Growing Greater, which described efforts to increase both the size and quality of Blue Network stations.Great and Growing Greater, National Broadcasting Company, Inc., 1936. It is perhaps worth noting that this document is a hardbound volume with a tip-in sheet with a cellophane overlay showing the changes made to the network; obviously, a product of significant expense. Among the improvements cited and proposed were increasing the broadcast power of WJZ and KDKA to 50,000 watts each, adding new stations to the group such as WEAN, WICC and WEBR, adding a Pacific Coast network (with KGO, KECA, KFSD, KEX, KJR and KGA) and expanding the daytime power of such stations as KOIL, KWK and KSO. This ad campaign, in a booklet tipped into the book, also showed a lengthy list of sponsors that had purchased Blue Network time. As the book states: \\"All of these additions and improvements are daily increasing the effectiveness of the NBC Blue Network. All contribute considerably to the listener's pleasure and to the advertiser's sales results.\\" In the months leading up to the January 1942 spinoff of the Blue Network, NBC undertook vigorous steps to create separate brand images for the Red and Blue Networks. To a certain extent, this had been going on since at least the summer of 1939, when Time magazine indicated that NBC was undertaking an extensive build-up of NBC Blue.Time magazine, August 21, 1939 Platters for the Pacific; it is worth noting that the article specifically describes NBC Blue as being the \\"weak sister.\\" Information, Please! is listed as the star program for NBC Blue at this time. In both the fall of 1937, and the fall of 1941, NBC would specifically identify a program as being broadcast on the \\"Red Network of the National Broadcasting Company\\", and at least in the fall of 1941, would have a similar tag for the Blue Network.See, for example, the September 5, 1937 broadcast of The Chase and Sanborn Hour and the October 11, 1937 broadcast of Fibber McGee and Molly, and the September 30, October 14 and December 23, 1941 broadcasts of Fibber McGee and Molly, versus the December 7, 1941 broadcast of the Inner Sanctum Mysteries. An example of this buildup comes in \\"Alice in Sponsor-Land\\", a publication put out by RCA some time in mid-1941The book is not dated, though there are references to data as of March 1941; the facts are slightly complicated by the fact that the book refers to the Burns and Allen program being sponsored by Hormel, which was not the case after March 1941. to market that network's shows.\\"Alice in Sponsor- Land\\" National Broadcasting Company (New York, 1941). The illustrations are by Barney Tobey, a contributor for over five decades to The New Yorker. This book focuses squarely on the Red Network, describing its entertainment programming, without any reference to the Blue Network.There are a few references to news programming, mostly Hans von Kaltenborn, who in one illustration is shown dancing with Alice! It is worth noting that both Information, Please! and Cavalcade of America are listed as Red Network shows; the latter had been a Blue Network show the previous year. Above the lineup of stationsWhich, by point of interest, includes two stations in the then-Commonwealth of the Philippines, two stations in Canada, and one station in Havana, Cuba. in the back of the volume is the tag-line: \\"This is the Red Network of the National Broadcasting Company.\\" In addition, throughout the book are slogans such as \\"Any time is Good Time on NBC Red!\\" This book, in part, demonstrates exactly how NBC differentiated the Red Network from the Blue Network in the fall of 1941, when, as noted, the Blue Network was still a part of NBC.  Programming, 1935‚Äì1941  What follows are some examples of the programming on NBC Blue that illustrate a gradual shift in tone. The official website for Helen Hayes shows a number of programs that she did for NBC Blue during this time, including a Eugene O'Neill play cycle in August 1937, two different dramatic series of her own in 1935‚Äì1936 (one sponsored by General Foods), and an appearance on a Blue series in 1940, one which brought famous people who would explain why a particular book has been their favorite. The \\"preview\\" section of the November 28, 1938 edition of Time gives some idea of the kind of programming that the Blue Network carried. On Friday, November 25 at 4 p.m., it carried a speech by then-Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Later that night, it carried the welterweight championship fight from Madison Square Garden, followed by Wagnerian opera from Chicago's Lyric Opera. Saturday, November 26 shows that the Blue carried both the Army‚ÄìNavy football game and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The Town Meeting of the Air on Thursday night carried a debate among economists as to whether an economic plan for world peace was possible. For one season in the early 1940s, a high-profile sponsored program on the Blue was The Cavalcade of America, a show dramatizing historical events which was sponsored by DuPont. The show, which debuted in 1935 on CBS and moved to the Blue in January 1940,Lackmann, op. cit., states that this program was broadcast on the Red Network, but at least for its fifth season, according to 1940 newspaper radio listings, the show was a Blue Network program was created at a time when the firm was under attack for being, in effect, a \\"merchant of death\\", and this show, which focused on American historical figures, was one way DuPont tried to burnish its image. Certainly, the show had high production values, as can be witnessed by its use of Raymond Massey for a show in February 1940 on Abraham Lincoln, as described in the February 26, 1940 issue of Time. It was also known for the use of university professors to vet the historical accuracy of the stories, as well as scripts by future Pulitzer Prize-winner Arthur Miller. (This show would eventually stay with NBC Red and NBC, starting in 1941, and the network would continue to broadcast the show even into the age of television). An interesting perspective can be seen on one of the most dramatic days in the history of network radio. On the morning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, while the first attack wave was over Oahu, NBC Blue was broadcasting The Inspector General, as part of its Great Plays program, while NBC Red was broadcasting a program with popular bandleader Sammy Kaye. At 4 p.m., ET, the Blue's broadcasts of the National Vespers was interrupted by various news reports. Later in the evening, at 6:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m., Drew Pearson's and Eleanor Roosevelt's regular broadcasts are heard, followed at 7 p.m. by a news roundup show that competed with Jack Benny, and later on Bible Week opposite the Chase and Sanborn Hour with Edgar Bergen. (The Blue did have the popular Inner Sanctum mystery anthology series later that night at 8:30, followed in turn by its number one show with Walter Winchell.) Lastly, of interest to those who may recall the satiric references in Warner Bros. cartoons of the era, at 10 p.m., the Blue carried The Goodwill Hour with John J. Anthony, dispensing advice to those who sought it, and who presumably were not tuned into Phil Spitalny's orchestra on the Red network. = Proposed sale = During the late 1930s, NBC seriously considered disposing of the Blue Network on its own initiative. There are substantial materials contained in the NBC History Files at the Library of CongressNBC History Files, Folders 300‚Äì304, inclusive illustrating this point. The fact that David Sarnoff, the head of RCA, was involved in these discussions indicates the high level at which this proposal was given consideration. A plain reading of the finding guide at the Library of Congress on the NBC History Files does not disclose the precise nature of these discussions, though the fact that these discussions existed is of record. In 1943, after the Blue Network had been spun off (but before its eventual sale), a promotional publication noted that: > \\"As far back as 1932, a group of executives of the National Broadcasting > Company conceived the idea that The Blue Network could progress faster and > serve its stations, its advertisers and the listening public much better if, > instead of being a part of NBC it were to become an independent > network.\\"\\"The Blue Network Today\\", page 4.  Divestiture, 1940‚Äì1943  = Initial moves by the FCC = During the 1930s, accusations were leveled at both NBC and CBS, in part by their rival Mutual, that the two senior network systems engaged in a series of anticompetitive activities, by locking up talent through in-house talent bureaus, and tightly tying together the system of affiliated stations through onerous contracts. In May 1940, after a three-year investigation, the Federal Communications Commission (which had had oversight over radio broadcasting since 1934) issued a scathing report (the \\"Report on Chain Broadcasting\\") attacking the affiliation policies of NBC and CBS, as well as the talent booking agency practices. The report proposed limiting each network to one affiliated station per city, which would have had a direct impact on NBC's dual-network ownership.See the 1941 edition of the Britannica Book of the Year, under the entry for \\"Radio, Industrial Aspects of\\", pages 566‚Äì7 In May 1941, the FCC went a step further and issued formal rules to break up what it perceived to be monopolies in radio; one of these rules specifically barred a network from operating more than one hookup, which would have been aimed directly at NBC's ownership of its two networks, in a manner even more explicit than the June 1940 report.See the 1942 edition of the Britannica Book of the Year, under the entry for \\"Radio\\", page 556, as well as the May 12, 1941 edition of Time Chains Unchained? = Litigation against NBC = Subsequent congressional hearings in the fall of 1941 resulted in the FCC watering down the rules, but the reprieve was short-lived, as the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, on December 31, 1941, filed an antitrust action against NBC and CBS, seeking to break up the networks' methods of operation. Mutual, at the same time, filed an antitrust suit of its own, in the amount of $10.275 million, according to the January 12, 1942 edition of Time.Time magazine, January 12, 1942 Old Law v. New Thing This account by Time describes at least one of the accusations leveled against NBC by Mutual, from an affidavit by Mutual's general manager. In the fall of 1941, Mutual debuted a comedy-variety series sponsored by Ballantine Ale, called Three Ring Time, starring Milton Berle and Charles Laughton.While a critical success, writer Ivan Shreve, Jr. notes that it received poor ratings and was dogged by feuding between Berle and Laughton; The show was set to debut on a 77-station network, but 14 of these stations were under contract to NBC, which had the power to exercise options on the most desirable time, in cities where there was limited competition. NBC eventually exercised options for six of these stations, with the result that Three Ring Time was being carried simultaneously on NBC Blue and Mutual. While the antitrust suits were pending, NBC and CBS had appealed to the courts regarding the ability of the FCC to regulate the operations of radio networks.They also, inter alia, sold their talent bureaus, thus eliminating that FCC grievance; New York Times, May 29, 1941, 14:1. While these appeals were in progress, NBC started the process of formally separating the operations of the Red Network and the Blue Network, a process which had begun in 1939 with the formation of a separate sales department for the Blue Network and which continued into 1940 and 1941 with the formation of other departments for the Blue Network. NBC began to specifically identify the networks, contrary to its general practice, and began to divide personnel and facilities; eventually, it formed a separate corporate entity for the Blue Network on January 8, 1942, \\"Blue Network Company, Inc.\\"At one point, the name \\"United Broadcasting System\\" seems to have been contemplated, but this was not used. New York Times, December 25, 1941, 39:7. C.E. Butterfield's radio news column, syndicated by Wide World, stated that the former NBC Blue would be called \\"BNC\\". The Capital, (Annapolis MD), January 10, 1942, p5. From this date on, while NBC still maintained ownership of the Blue Network, it was for most purposes an entirely separate network. NBC Red at this point became known as simply NBC.See the 1943 Britannica Book of the Year, under the entry \\"Radio\\", page 579; note, however, that \\"The Blue Network Today,\\" at p. 4, considers the start date to be January 1, 1942, not January 9. This 1944 advertisement,Albert Lea Evening Tribune, March 3, 1944, 4:7‚Äì8 while it dates from after the sale by NBC of the Blue Network, shows how the Blue Network continued to have access to NBC facilities; in this case, the famed radio studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City In June 1942 the United States Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of the FCC over the issuance of rules relating to chain broadcasting. While the FCC litigation continued in the wake of this ruling, the public and private antitrust litigation was held in abeyance.See the 1943 Britannica Book of the Year, under the entry \\"Radio\\", page 579. On May 10, 1943 the Supreme Court (National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190) upheld the right of the FCC to regulate practically everything that was radio, by sustaining the jurisdiction of the FCC to regulate the contractual relations of the major networks with affiliated stations.Folder 862 in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress contains a report, dated May 19, 1943, of the reaction of NBC President Niles Trammell to this decision; this report has not been reviewed for the preparation of this wikipedia entry. Efforts in late 1943 before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee to obtain legislation to, in effect, reverse the decision went nowhere. = Sale = The January 11, 1943 edition of Time states that seven investment houses, three insurance companies, two manufacturers, a daily newspaper, and an industrialist had all taken serious looks at purchasing the network.Time magazine, January 11, 1943 Black & Blue However, with the ruling from the Supreme Court, NBC was now spurred to take vigorous action to sell the Blue Network. The bidding came down to three groups, with an initial bid of $6 million, which was raised in sequence by rivals to $6.5 and then $7 million. In late July, 1943, the investment banking firm of Dillon, Read & Co. made a bid of $7.8 million.New York Times, July 28, 1943, p. 22. On July 30, 1943, just over two months after the court's ruling, RCA announced the sale of the network to American Broadcasting System, Inc., a firm controlled by Edward J. Noble, a former undersecretary of commerce who was better known as the chairman of Life Savers Corp. The price was announced as $8 million.San Mateo Times, August 13, 1943, 2:1 Newspaper Archive. This was followed by a petition to the FCC to approve the sale, which was filed on August 13.San Mateo Times, August 13, 1943, op. cit. = FCC hearings = One of the significant issues surrounding the sale of the Blue Network involved the network's practices regarding \\"controversial\\" topics and proponents. The network, citing the code of the National Association of Broadcasters, declined to sell time to labor organizations, cooperatives, and other organizations advocating \\"controversial topics\\", but did give them free air time, provided there was an opportunity for the other side to be heard. On August 27, 1943, the Congress of Industrial Organizations filed a brief in a petition to intervene in the FCC proceedings on the network sale.New York Times, August 27, 1943 17:1 The CIO complained that the NAB code regarding \\"controversial\\" broadcasts inhibited its ability to buy airtime. While the FCC denied the CIO's petition to intervene, it did invite the CIO to give testimony in the hearings.New York Times, September 4, 1943 26:2 and Galveston News, September 4, 1943, 9:5 Newspaper Archive At the hearings held on September 10, 1943, FCC Chairman James L. Fly roundly denounced the policy of the Blue Network in refusing to sell airtime, but granting air time for free, to proponents of controversial broadcasts. He colorfully described the policy as chasing would-be purchasers from the front of the shop, but \\"directing them to the back door for a handout.\\" Mark Woods, the head of the Blue Network, defended the policy, stating that it was in compliance with the NAB code.New York Times, September 11, 1943 11:1 When Edward J. Noble testified at the hearings held on September 20, 1943, he was questioned closely by Chairman Fly as to the policies regarding the refusal to sell air time to labor organizations, cooperatives and other special interest groups.New York Times, October 4, 1943, 24:3 Noble was directed by Chairman Fly at this hearing to submit a statement as to what the policy would be of the Blue Network in terms of \\"the expansion of the mechanisms of free speech.\\" On October 3, 1943, Noble released a letter to the FCC in which it was stated that the Blue Network would meet \\"with an open mind\\" all requests for broadcasting time, \\"considering each on the merits\\", and excluding none on the basis of ideas or personality. Certainly, not all were pleased by Chairman Fly's stance. Columnist David Lawrence, in his October 7, 1943 column, thought that the FCC had overstepped its authority in attempting to force the Blue Network to change its policies regarding the sale of airtime.Charleston (WV) Daily Mail, October 7, 1943, 4:2 Newspaper Archive Noble's written response seems to have been sufficient. The sale was approved by the FCC on October 12, 1943.Austin American, October 13, 1943, 3:5 Newspaper Archive Noble was forced to divest himself of New York station WMCA, which he had owned since 1940, but his American Broadcasting System, Inc., the entity formed to be the parent of the Blue Network, acquired WJZ, additional stations in Chicago and San Francisco, as well as land-line leases, certain studio facilities and leased studio facilities, and the affiliation system.See, inter alia, the 1944 Britannica Book of the Year, op. cit. = Antitrust conclusion = Jessie Royce Landis (l) and Celeste Holm (r) pose with a Blue Network microphone in this 1943 publicity still for the show The House on Q Street. Collection of E.O. CostelloThis was a dramatic program broadcast on Thursday nights at 7.05 EWT during the 1943‚Äì1944 season, set in a boardinghouse in wartime Washington, D.C., with Landis playing the housekeeper, and Holm the daughter of a senator, who in turn was played by Douglas Holm. The particular copy of this publicity still that is available is marked on the back as having come from \\"Blue Network Company, Inc., a Radio Corporation of America Service\\", indicating the photo was taken some time just prior to, or just after, the sale to Edward J. Noble. While Swartz and Reinehr in their catalog of radio shows list this show in error as a Mutual show, Terrace in his catalog correctly lists this as a Blue Network show. Following the sale, the Department of Justice dropped its antitrust proceedings against NBC on October 17, 1943,Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune, October 18, 1943, 7:3 Newspaper Archive having previously dropped proceedings against CBS on October 11, and the federal courts, upon its motion, dismissed Mutual's antitrust claims against CBS and NBC.See the 1944 edition of the Britannica Book of the Year, under the entry \\"Radio\\", page 584; New York Times, October 12, 1943, 39:3 and October 19, 1943, 21:7.  Changes, 1943‚Äì1945  In the April 21, 1947 issue of Time,Time, April 21, 1947 Network Without Ulcers Mark Woods called the Blue Network of 1942 (that is, just before the sale) \\"a dump.\\" The article describes the then 116 station network as the home of cast-off speeches and classical music, which had only generated $14 million in revenue. It could, perhaps, be argued that Woods was denigrating the state of the Blue Network at that time, to contrast with the relative success of the network later in the 1940s; this is possible in light of the fact that the Blue Network had been profitable in 1942.New York Times, December 23, 1942, 33:7. Woods and the rest of the management team, after the sale to Noble, began to take steps to make the Blue Network more competitive with NBC and CBS. = Finances and ownership = An early step was to obtain a deep pocketed backer. Noble, on December 28, 1943, sold a 12.5% stake to Time Inc.,Fresno Bee, December 29, 1943, 4:2. This stake, however, was sold back by Time in 1945 Network Without Ulcers; New York Times, October 20, 1945, 7:2. and a similar stake to advertising executive Chester J. LaRoche (grandfather of Todius Barnard LaRoche), for $500,000 each. Smaller stakes were taken by Blue Network executives Mark Woods (president) and Edgar Kobak (executive vice-president, who would the next year leave the Blue for Mutual).See the 1944 edition of the Britannica Book of the Year, page 584 for the information regarding the initial sales, and Fresno Bee, December 29, 1943, 4:2 AdvertisementAlbert Lea Evening Tribune, February 13, 1947, 7:7‚Äì8 promoting a broadcast of the long-running NBC Blue, Blue Network and ABC public affairs program, \\"Town Meeting of the Air.\\" Note that even at this late date, in 1947 (i.e. 20 months after the official change), ABC is still using the Blue Network tag for certain promotional purposes. = Programming = During the 1943‚Äì1945 period, the Blue Network used many of the NBC broadcasting facilities, including the Radio City facilities in New York (see the KATE ad, above), as well as studio space in Los Angeles. The back of the ticket for \\"Fun Valley\\", a show starring veteran comedian Al Pearce, sponsored by Dr. Pepper and broadcast on Sunday afternoons in 1944, makes reference to both Blue Network Company, Inc. and the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. in terms of the rules and regulations audience members had to obey.Ticket for the Sunday, March 19, 1944 broadcast of \\"Fun Valley\\", in the collection of E.O. Costello. Of obvious import were steps taken to preserve the best programming the network had, and make improvements; these were happening in the period immediately prior to, and following, the sale of the network. While the Blue Network did lose a few programs to NBC, such as Quiz Kids and Duffy's Tavern (more shows that debuted or had a previous run on the Blue; see Lackmann, op. cit.) and the NBC Symphony Orchestra (Lackmann, op. cit.), it did retain one highly rated show, the Jergen's Journal with Walter Winchell, which managed to compete successfully with NBC's powerhouse Sunday night lineup (it was the 11th-ranked program for all of 1943‚Äì1944, and Blue's only program in the top 20).See The Blue Network also retained the rights to broadcast the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts; Milton Cross was the host for NBC, Blue, ABC, CBS, and the opera's own broadcasts from 1931 through 1975. This was in spite of the fact that NBC did not want to assign the rights to either the Town Meeting of the Air or the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts to the Blue Network.Internal memorandum dated February 16, 1942 from I.E. Showerman to Frank E. Mullen, NBC History Files, Folder 128 In an interview with Time published on January 11, 1943, Woods noted that the Blue Network was seeking to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS by the aggressive use of transcriptions, contrary to the practice of the larger networks. This would have its full fruition when Bing Crosby started transcribing his prime-time shows in 1946. In certain respects, the Blue made attempts to grab the spotlight with unusual broadcasts. On December 25, 1942, the Coca-Cola Company sponsored an all-day broadcast on the network, a \\"Victory Parade's Christmas Party of Spotlight Bands\\". The hiring, in 1943, of noted bandleader Paul Rodgers as Director of Music was an attempt by the network, in its own words, to strengthen the entire musical schedule, as well as obtain a prominent figure.\\"The Blue Network Today\\", page 20. The \\"Metropolitan Auditions of the Air\\", discussed above, had moved to the Blue Network by 1943 as well, joining the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\\"The Blue Network Today\\", pages 20, 22. 1944 souvenir booklet for the Blue Network audience participation show Ladies Be Seated, which would continue to have a multi-year run on ABC radio. This show was also one of the first programs to be televised by ABC. A script survives from a February 25, 1945 local broadcast over WRGB, the Schenectady, New York television station of General Electric, hosted by Johnny Olson. The network is referred to in the script as being \\"The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.\\"Please Standy By: A Prehistory of Television, Michael Ritchie (Overlook Press, New York, 1994), pages 223 ff. News continued to be a priority for the network; indeed, Raymond Swing would win a Peabody Award for the network in 1944 for his news commentary.

The February 22, 1943 edition of Time notes that Woods had to clamp down on both Walter Winchell and Drew Pearson for over-aggressive name calling in their broadcasts, much to their dismay.Time Magazine, February 22, 1943 Bluenoses? Blue Network Programs  Several programs can be cited to show how the Blue Network was striving to reach beyond its previous reputation, and compete head-on with CBS and NBC as a stand-alone network. One ambitious broadcast, copies of which are generally available to collectors of old-time radio broadcasts, was a special two-hour program broadcast on Christmas Day, 1944. Entitled \\"Christmas on the Blue\\", the show was emceed by Gracie Fields, and featured, among other stars, Joe E. Brown, The Andrews Sisters, Ed Wynn, Paul Whiteman and others. The show also featured broadcasts of overseas servicemen sending greetings and well wishes to their loved ones at home, something unusual for the era. One of the pairings on this special program involved Wendell Niles, a long-time announcer on many radio shows, including Bob Hope's. The Blue Network gave him and partner Don Prindle a comedy series, Niles and Prindle, which is referenced in the special as being scheduled for a debut the following month. It was said to involve two friends \\"who argued about everything\\", and had a brief run in 1945.Handbook of Old-Time Radio, Jon D. Swartz and Robert C. Reinehr (Scarecrow Press, Metuchen (NJ), 1993), page 478. It was certainly unusual for the Blue Network to attempt to convert a long-time announcer into a featured comedy star, and in this sense, \\"Niles and Prindle\\", if not unique (given that Graham McNamee was the \\"Perfect Foil\\" to Ed Wynn), it must be said to be at least quite singular. Of interest to animation fans was a show called Nitwit Court, which sought to do to John J. Anthony's The Goodwill Hour what It Pays to Be Ignorant did to Information, Please!. Host Ransom Sherman would pose problems to a jury consisting of Arthur Q. Bryan, as \\"Willow\\", a man with a lisp, Mel Blanc, as \\"Hornblower\\", a fumbling motorboat owner, and Sara Berner as \\"Bubbles Lowbridge\\", a not terribly bright woman.See Swartz and Reinehr, page 44, and Radio's Golden Years: The Encyclopedia of Radio Programs 1930‚Äì1960 by Vincent Terrace (A.S. Barnes & Co., New York, 1981), pages 200‚Äì01. = Affiliate growth = Matchbooks advertising the Blue Network affiliated stations in Indianapolis and Cleveland, from between 1943 (when WJW joined the Blue Network) and 1945. Matchbook from WFCI/1420 (now defunct) at Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Strengthening the affiliate station list was a matter of importance to the network. While the network had 116 stations in January 1942 and 155 stations as of June 1943, this still meant that it could only offer to advertisers coverage of approximately 76% of the radio homes in the United States.\\"The Blue Network Today\\", pages 7‚Äì8. In this sense, the moves by the FCC to loosen the provisions of the contracts binding affiliated stations to networks helped the Blue Network. This allowed it to pick up a few additional stations in 1944, including (ironically) a few from the Mutual Broadcasting System.1945 Britannica Book of the Year, entry \\"Radio\\", page 585 This was one of its priorities, as the Blue Network had inherited smaller and less powerful stations than NBC and CBS. = Rebranding = Finally, a major priority of the Blue Network was to form a new identity, one that would mark a break with the past. In December, 1945, the FCC approved the transfer of The Blue Network, Inc.'s broadcast licenses to American Broadcasting Company. Beginning on January 22, 1945, the network's opening and closing announcements changed to \\"The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.\\" Starting February 18, the same wording was instituted as the network outcue for station breaks. On June 15, 1945, the Blue Network formally changed its name to the American Broadcasting Company.1946 Britannica Book of the Year, entry \\"Radio\\", page 624; see also Time Magazine, June 25, 1945 No More Blue. They were not alone in desiring this catchy acronym.Nor was this the first time: Folder 303 in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress indicates that NBC executive and former announcer Phillips Carlin recommended a name change from the Blue Network to the American Broadcasting Company ‚Äì in December 1941. Two prior claimants were bought out prior to June 1945,1946 Britannica Book of the Year, op. cit. and in negotiations with the Associated Broadcasting Corp. in December 1945, it acquired the rights to the name \\"ABC\\" from yet a third party.Time, December 12, 1945 ABC; New York Times, December 11, 1945, 26:3 From June 1945 forward, the entity has been known generally as the American Broadcasting Company, and reference should be made to that entry for its subsequent history. The souvenir program for the Maurice B. Sachs Amateur Hour broadcast of Sunday, September 30, 1945 refers to the broadcast as coming from \\"Blue Network Studio A.\\"\\"Maurice B. Sachs Amateur Hour Souvenir Program\\" dated September 30, 1945, in the collection of E.O. Costello Even into 1947, in some markets, ABC would promote its shows with the tag-line \\"It's a Blue Network Program!\\"Evening Tribune (Albert Lea, Minnesota) February 13, 1947 7:7‚Äì8. The program in question was the old Blue Network standby, \\"Town Meeting of the Air.\\" One example has been found where a newspaper referred to a program as being broadcast over \\"ABC's Blue Network\\" as late as 1949. Berkshire County (MA) Eagle, February 16, 1949 2:5‚Äì6  Television  By June 1945, commercial television in the United States had been frozen, owing to the lower level of priorities given to it as compared to war work. Furthermore, ABC was generally slow to move into television broadcasting. It did win approval to build five television stations; the first, WJZ-TV in New York was completed in the summer of 1948. WJZ-TV was followed by stations in Chicago and Detroit later in 1948; and San Francisco and Los Angeles during 1949‚Äìall five stations were assigned to broadcast on channel 7. Until those stations were built, ABC had to lease time and studio facilities from other stations including DuMont network New York flagship WABD, as well as other stations in Philadelphia and Washington which eventually helped form the core of the ABC television network.\\"Please Stand By\\", op. cit., pages 146‚Äì7. It might be supposed that the Blue Network never existed in television, but as noted above, the Blue Network did make at least a few known forays into television prior to the June 1945 name change. For example, the Blue Network applied for a construction permit for a TV station in the upper VHF band, but all such applications were shelved during the war years. Experiments were also conducted by the Blue Network in television program production before it permanently became ABC and formally opened a network under the ABC name in 1948. The script for a February 25, 1945 broadcast of Ladies Be Seated, which was a relatively popular audience- participation/stunt game show on Blue Network radio, still exists, and is reprinted in full in Ritchie.\\"Please Stand By\\", op. cit., pages 223 ff. It is, in fact, the script for the first broadcast.\\"Please Stand By\\", op. cit., pages 67‚Äì8 It was hosted by Johnny Olson, who would later become the long-running announcer on most of CBS's Goodson-Todman-produced game shows, most notably Match Game and The Price Is Right. Technically, this was not a network broadcast, as it was broadcast locally on WRGB, the General Electric television station in Schenectady, New York. However, the opening title card, according to the script, was for \\"The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.\\" No video copy of this broadcast is known to exist.  Blue Network stations  As noted above, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Blue Network was divided into groups of stations. The core group of stations was known as \\"Basic Blue\\", and covered the Northeast United States/New England and portions of the Upper Midwest, around the Great Lakes area. The Southern Blue Network covered the Deep South, the Mountain Blue Group the Mountain states, the Pacific Coast Blue Network the Pacific Coast states, and the Southwestern Blue Group the Oklahoma-Texas region. A pamphlet published by the American Rolling Mill Co. in connection with a radio talk on \\"The Miracle of Steel\\" given on the Blue Network on April 9, 1939 has a listing of the Blue Network stations participating in this broadcast.\\"Miracle of Steel: A Radio Talk by the Armco Ironmaster\\", The American Rolling Mill Co.

The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is a ceramic trauma plate used by the United States Armed Forces. It was first used in the Interceptor Body Armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available \\"plate carriers\\". The Kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9√ó19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher-velocity rifle rounds, SAPI plates are needed. ESAPI ESAPI and ESBI plates are visible with the components of a Modular Tactical Vest In May 2005, the U.S. Armed Forces began replacing the standard Small Arms Protective Insert plates with the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI). An ESAPI provides protection from .30-06 Springfield M2 armor- piercing (AP) with a steel or tungsten penetrator in accordance with the NIJ Level IV standard, but costs about $600 per plate, 50% more than SAPI plates. They are produced by Ceradyne, BAE Systems, and ArmorWorks Enterprises. XSAPI A call for a next generation plate, to stop even greater velocity threats than the ESAPI plate was issued by the U.S. Army in 2008. The X Threat Small Arms Protective Insert plates are specifically allowed scalar or flexible systems, and asked for better coverage, with less than a pound of additional weight.https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/upload/W91CRB07R0041/Atch02-REVXSAPI- PD_A_.pdf XSAPI did in fact offer slightly better protection, at the cost of more weight and thicker armor profile.https://www.bodyarmornews.com/better- body-armor-means-more-weight-for-troops/ The XSAPI is intended to protect against an \\"X-Threat\\", which is able to be inferred from another source to be the M993 7.62 NATO armor piercing projectile. In addition, there is record of the FBI utilizing the plate for their purposes on May 2011. The plates were developed in response to a perceived threat of AP projectiles in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 120,000 inserts were procured; however, the AP threats they were meant to stop never materialized, and the plates were put into storage.  Materials and capabilities  The standard plate for the Interceptor body armor is made of boron carbide or silicon carbide ceramic. New ESAPI plates are also made of boron carbide.VET BodyArmorFacts The standard plates are not given an NIJ rating, as they are tested in accordance with specific protocols for the military and not the NIJ's testing. Military testing calls for survivability of three hits from the round marked on the plate - for standard SAPI, of a caliber up to 7.62√ó51mm NATO M80 ball and of a muzzle velocity up to 2,750 ft/s (840 m/s). For ESAPI, a .30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing (AP) (.30-06 black-tip armor-piercing) cartridge. This performance is only assured when backed by the soft armor of the OTV (or any soft armor which meets military requirements for protection). The ceramic plate is backed with a shield made of Spectra, a material up to 40% stronger than Kevlar, to trap any fragments of either plate or projectile and prevent them from injuring the wearer.  Sizes and weights  SAPI plates meant for body armor come in front and back plates which are identical, and smaller side plates. The front and back plates come in five sizes. Their dimensions are the following: Front and back SAPI plates: *Extra Small - 1.27 kg (2.8 lb)  184 x 292 mm (7¬º x 11¬Ω in) *Small - 1.59 kg (3.5 lb)  222 x 298 mm (8¬æ x 11¬æ in) *Medium - 1.82 kg (4.0 lb)  241 x 318 mm (9¬Ω x 12¬Ω in) *Large - 2.09 kg (4.6 lb)  260 x 337 mm (10‚Öõ x 13¬º in) *Extra Large 2.40 kg (5.3 lb)  280 x 356 mm (11 x 14 in) ESAPI plates are the same size but slightly greater in weight. *Extra Small - 1.70 kg (3.75 lb) *Small - 2.08 kg (4.60 lb) *Medium - 2.50 kg (5.50 lb) *Large - 2.85 kg (6.30 lb) *Extra Large - 3.25 kg (7.20 lb) Side SAPI (SSAPI) torso side plates, and their replacement, the Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI), have identical weights and dimensions. ESBI plates can be replaced with size X-Small ESAPI plates (by unfolding an extension built into the bottom of the ESBI Carrier assembly), if permitted by the unit commander.https://ciehub.info/equipment/protective/IBA/SAPI/ESBI.htmlhttps://olive- drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_body_armor_sapi.php * 1 kg (2.3 lb)  150 x 200 mm (6 x 8 in)  Physics  The mechanism of effect lies in absorbing and dissipating the projectile's kinetic energy in local shattering of the ceramic plate and blunting the bullet material on the hard ceramic. The Spectra backing then spreads the energy of the impact to a larger area and stops the fragments, reducing the likelihood of fatal injury to the wearer. The same principle is used for the ceramic tiles used for the armored cockpits of some military airplanes, and the anti-spallation liners used in modern armored personnel carriers. It is a false assumption that eliminating the penetration of a projectile into the body by using a personal armour system ensures that the wearer will not experience serious injury or death. Blunt force trauma can cause fatal damage to internal organs.There has been no recorded death caused by blunt force trauma from a non-penetrating hit.

It is a story about cultural conflicts experienced by a Chinese family in the United States. Plot Grandfather Xu (Zhu Xu) comes from China to visit the family of his son, Datong Xu (Tony Leung), in St. Louis. While there, he gives his grandson, Dennis Xu (Dennis Zhu), a treatment of Gua Sha to treat a slight fever (being unable to read English labels of medicine). Social workers, however, mistake the harmless traditional Chinese medical treatment for child abuse due to the obvious marks left on Dennis' back. The life of the family is sent into turmoil when Dennis is taken away by the child protection agency. In court, the prosecution includes Datong's inclusion of a Chinese legendary character Sun Wukong (Chinese traditional: Â≠´ÊÇüÁ©∫; simplified: Â≠ôÊÇüÁ©∫) in his design of a violent video game. The prosecution implies that since Datong includes violence in his game, he values it. Datong, who is furious, insists that the prosecution does not understand the cultural value of Sun Wukong and that the icon's inclusion does not mean he abuses his son. He insists that what he does in his job does not relate to how he runs his home. Meanwhile, Grandfather Xu leaves America because he finds that the living environment is really not suitable for him, as he does not want to live in a place where a simple, harmless treatment like Gua Sha, which is so common in China, is treated as child abuse. Furthermore, he cannot converse in English. Datong's friend and lawyer, John Quilin (Hollis Houston), tries Gua Sha and proves that the treatment leaves painful-looking marks that are not actually painful or harmful at all. Finally, Datong is able to return home and the family is reunited. This movie's story is meant to demonstrate the difference between western and Chinese culture.

Production logo Mark VII Limited was known for its famous production logo attached to the end of its productions. The logo, in use in one form or another for much of the company's existence, showed the hands of Jack Webb's construction foreman Harold C. Nyby holding a hammer and a stamp against a sheet of metal. As a timpani roll played, he struck two blows on the stamp and then moved his hands to reveal the Roman numeral VII indented into the sheet. The origin of the name \\"Mark VII\\" is unclear. One source said the name meant nothing, and that it was made up over coffee one day. Another source says Webb just liked the look of the Roman numerals. The Mark VII production logo is one of the more recognizable logos of its time and has become iconic, with many instances of filmmakers and production companies paying homage to it in various ways, most notably Williams Street Productions of Adult Swim/Cartoon Network programming, whose logo utilizes the same drumroll/hammer clinks soundtrack seen on the 1967 Mark VII logo. The Mark VII Limited logo was also spoofed at the end of the 1954 Woody Woodpecker cartoon Under The Counter Spy. In this spoof, the man accidentally hits his thumb with the hammer and yells \\"OUCH!\\", then pulls the hammer away to reveal the ending title card. The man's voice was supplied by Daws Butler. The 1955 Three Stooges' short Blunder Boys not only was a parody of Dragnet, but ended with Larry being stamped with \\"VII 1/2 The End\\" on his forehead. Gunther-Wahl Productions used a similar card at the end of its cartoons. The logo was remade multiple times during the company's history. It is reported that the early logos featured Jack Webb's hands but the later logos featured Ivan Martin's. Ivan was the director of studio operations for 20th Century Fox at the time of his retirement but worked in the studio's visual effects department during production of the logos.

Cynar is an Italian bitter liqueur of the amaro variety. It is made from 13 herbs and plants, predominant amongst which is the artichoke (Cynara scolymus), from which the drink derives its name. Cynar is dark brown in color, has a bittersweet flavor, and its strength is 16.5% ABV. It was launched in Italy in 1952. Cynar is an ap√©ritif (low sugar, low alcohol, meant to stimulate appetite), and can be consumed by itself, or in a number of cocktails. One such cocktail includes Cynar and soda (mixed with soda water and lemon or orange slice, or with cola, eggnog, tonic water, milk or bitter lemon soda). Europeans often mix it with orange juice, especially in Switzerland and Southern Germany, where Cynar and orange juice is a very popular combination. A variation of the Negroni cocktail uses Cynar in place of Campari, in the same way that a Cynar Spritz replaces Aperol. Because of its artichoke component, Cynar is regarded as a digestif as well as an ap√©ritif. Since 1995 Cynar has been manufactured and distributed by the Campari Group. Advertising The liquor became popular during the early 1960s thanks to its appearance on the Italian television advertising show Carosello. The series of commercials, first starring Ferruccio De Ceresa, and from 1966 Ernesto Calindri, showed the actor sipping Cynar while sitting at a table placed in the middle of a busy street, urging consumers to drink Cynar \\"against the strain of modern life\\". Toward the end of the seventies, the commercial changed settings and moved from the busy city to a field of artichokes. The partnership between Calindri and the brand lasted until 1984.

Owned and operated by Cumulus Media, WDVD's studios and offices are located in the Fisher Building in Detroit's New Center district near downtown, while its transmitter is located in Oakland County in Royal Oak Township at 8 Mile Road and Wyoming Avenue. WDVD broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 20,000 watts from an antenna that is 787 feet in height, and transmits its signal from the same tower from which five other Detroit FM radio stations broadcast. WDVD is licensed for HD Radio operations. History =WJR 96 FM/California Radio= On June 1, 1948, the station signed on as WJR-FM, simulcasting WJR (760 AM), Detroit's CBS Radio Network affiliate. In 1966 WJR-FM separated programming from WJR (AM) and began airing \\"The Young Sound,\\" a beautiful music format featuring instrumental covers of contemporary hits which was used on many CBS-affiliated FM stations. In 1969, the station adopted the \\"Solid Gold Rock and Roll\\" automated format from Drake-Chenault, a mix of soft rock, current Easy Listening (adult contemporary) chart hits, and rock and roll oldies, and began to brand itself as \\"California Radio.\\" After almost three years, the station reverted to beautiful music, with which it was quite successful for a time. Competitors at this time were WLDM-FM (now WKQI), WWJ-FM (now WXYT-FM), and WKNR-FM (later WNIC-FM). =Hot Hits 96/WHYT= In June 1982, Billboard Magazine reported that WJR-FM's owner, Capital Cities Communications, had hired consultant Mike Joseph to implement his widely successful \\"Hot Hits\\" format on WJR-FM by the fall of that year, taking note of the success the format was having in Philadelphia (WCAU-FM) and in Chicago (WBBM-FM). In July 1982, WJR-FM applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a call letter change to WHYT. The call letter change was approved on August 16, 1982. On September 15, 1982, at 5 p.m., WHYT converted to a new format after one last spin of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" by Frank Sinatra, followed by the first song of the new format, \\"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\\" by The Gap Band. \\"Hot Hits\\" was a fast-moving, jingle-intensive format that featured a tight rotation of 50 current hits (no recurrent hits or oldies, unless they happened to be featured on currently charting albums). The station used the on-air names 96 Now (the same slogan used by WBBM-FM, which still operates on the same frequency in Chicago to this day) and 96 WHYT. The \\"Hot Hits\\" format in Detroit was a moderate ratings success, but did not approach the popularity that WCAU or WBBM-FM were enjoying with Hot Hits, probably due in part to heavy competition from Detroit's urban contemporary and album rock stations. In response, WHYT's CHR format went through several metamorphoses in the next few years, dropping the Mike Joseph formatics (though they continued to use the slogan \\"Hot Hits\\" on the air through 1986) and adopting several different on-air monikers, including WHYT 96 Hit FM, and HitRadio 96 WHYT. One of the noteworthy WHYT personalities during this time was Joey Reynolds, who had last worked in Detroit radio at WXYZ-AM eighteen years earlier. =Power 96/96.3 FM= In 1986, shortly after Capital Cities merged with ABC, the station retooled itself as Power 96. Under programmer Rick Gillette, the station added more dance music and urban contemporary product to its CHR playlist, and listenership increased, leading the station to be a regular top 10 ratings finisher through the end of the decade. In 1989, the station rebranded as simply 96.3 FM, taking on even more of a rhythmic contemporary lean. For much of the 1980s, WHYT was Detroit's local affiliate for Casey Kasem's (and then Shadoe Stevens') American Top 40. WHYT's major competitors from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s were Z95.5 and 99.5 The Fox, as well as then-Churban powerhouse WJLB. The station's peak of popularity came during its days as both Power 96 and then 96.3 FM from roughly 1986 to 1991, when the station moved its music mix toward rhythmic CHR (while not totally abandoning mainstream pop and rock), frequently racked up top five Arbitron ratings 12+, and was one of the top stations in the 12-24 age demographics (often neck-and-neck with WJLB, with Z95.5 coming in a distant third despite often beating WHYT 12+). Michael J. Foxx (not to be confused with actor Michael J. Fox), Sonny Joe Harris, Bo \\"The Jammer\\" Jackson (not to confused with the sports star Bo Jackson), Dave Fogel, Lisa Lisa \\"The Party Princess\\" Orlando (not to be confused with the musical artist Lisa Lisa of Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam), Michael Waite and the Morning Zoo were all popular DJ's at WHYT. In 1991, however, the debut of 89X, as well as Foxx's departure, took substantial market share away from WHYT as teens and young adults flocked to the \\"cutting edge\\" modern rock format of 89X. =96.3 JAMZ= In 1992, the station delved even farther into rhythmic CHR territory, becoming known as \\"96.3 Jamz.\\" WHYT eliminated most of the mainstream pop and rock from its playlist and began to focus almost exclusively on hip-hop, R&B; and dance hits as well as some dance remixes of mainstream hits. =The Planet 96.3= During Memorial Day weekend in 1994 came a formatic shift at WHYT, as the station modified its Rhythmic CHR format into a sound it tagged Planet Jams, evolving into a hybrid of hip-hop and alternative rock while dropping all R&B; product. This format, known in radio trades as \\"Channel X\\" (also implemented at KUBE in Seattle among other stations), was described by some as a radio version of MTV. Alternative bands such as Soundgarden, Nine Inch Nails, and Pearl Jam were played alongside Coolio, Snoop Dogg, and Da Brat, and the station also continued to sprinkle in some dance hits from the likes of Real McCoy, Madonna, Ace of Base, and 2 Unlimited. Within a few months, the station would drop all hip-hop and dance songs as WHYT, now known as The Planet 96.3, become a more straightforward alternative station. In reference to the format shift, program director Rick Gillette, who had guided WHYT to high ratings during its \\"Power 96\\" and \\"96.3FM\\" days in the late 1980s, claimed that the station was merely responding to the popularity of the \\"hot\\" music of the time, which happened to be Alternative. In addition to Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and the other popular rock bands of the day, the Planet played a number of local Detroit acts that never achieved major national stardom, such as the Suicide Machines and Charm Farm, as well as some non-mainstream dance and ambient artists such as Vanessa Daou. After completing a deal with a college radio station in Plattsburgh, New York, the station's calls were switched to WPLT to match the \\"Planet\\" moniker on June 30, 1997. (The WHYT calls are now used at a contemporary Christian music station near Lapeer, Michigan.) With the call letter change, however, the station tweaked its format to more of a Modern Adult Contemporary sound to distinguish it more from competing alternative- rock station CIMX (and, later in 1997, WXDG). The Planet dropped White Zombie, The Offspring and other harder-edged artists from its playlist and focused more on alternative pop-rock acts such as Jewel, Sheryl Crow, and Barenaked Ladies. The Planet also played Classic Alternative music heavily, with the hour-long \\"Flashback Lunch\\" middays at noon; \\"Saturday Night Flashbacks\\", with dance and extended versions of classic alternative and '80s songs, broadcast live from the nightclub Clutch Cargo's in suburban Pontiac; and holiday- weekend countdowns of \\"The Coolest Flashbacks of All Time.\\" During this time, the station identified itself as Modern Hits of the 80s and 90s. A popular feature on WPLT was Big Sonic Heaven, a Sunday-night program of ambient, trance, chill and non-mainstream dance music hosted by DJ Darren Revell. The Planet made some ratings headway with the Modern AC format, but was never a major player in the market. On September 6, 1999, at 4:30 p.m., after finishing their Labor Day weekend \\"Flashback 500\\" countdown (with \\"In Your Eyes\\" by Peter Gabriel being the #1 song), the station began a 3-hour stunt of a loop of \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" by R.E.M.. At 7:30 p.m., WPLT relaunched as \\"Alternative Classics\\", an attempt to convert the station's popular 1980s \\"Flashback\\" shows into a full-time format by combining 1980s new wave and punk with more recent (but non-current) 1990s grunge/alternative, while keeping the \\"Planet\\" moniker. The first song on the relaunched \\"Planet\\" was \\"Plush\\" by Stone Temple Pilots. Core artists of \\"Alternative Classics\\" included U2, Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Go-Go's, Peter Gabriel, Erasure, and Echo & the Bunnymen. The change failed to raise ratings, and within a year, WPLT had begun to re-add current music into its rotation (such as \\"Smooth\\" by Santana and Rob Thomas) under the guise of \\"Future Alternative Classics\\". =96.3 WDVD= In response to continued low ratings, the station dropped its \\"Planet\\" moniker in early 2001, changed its calls to WDVD on March 14, and gradually shifted its playlist towards a more mainstream Hot AC direction, though still heavy on alternative rock. The shift was completed on June 29, when the station adopted the new \\"96.3 DVD\\" moniker and the \\"Today's Best Variety\\" slogan. The \\"Flashback\\" programs and \\"Big Sonic Heaven\\" were cancelled shortly afterward. (The WPLT calls have since been picked up by a country station in Spooner, Wisconsin.) After the transition to Hot AC and the WDVD calls, the station continued to feature a heavy alternative-rock base for several years, while playing \\"hair bands\\" such as Poison and Aerosmith and pop artists like Kelly Clarkson and Christina Aguilera, and remained in the lower echelons of the Detroit ratings. By 2006, however, this began to change as WDVD freshened its presentation and began to evolve into more of an Adult Top 40 station, dropping most 1980s titles from its playlist, adding jingles, and branded itself with the new slogan Today's Best Hits Without the Rap (and taking shots at longtime rival station WKQI for playing too much hip hop). Generally, though, as per its slogan, the station avoids hip hop music except for those who cross over to the Hot AC charts. Songs by Hot AC artists with hip-hop guest stars, such as \\"California Gurls\\" by Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg, typically have the rap breaks edited out. Former logo WDVD Today In February 2006, WDVD, along with its sister stations, WJR and WDRQ, were included in the sale of ABC Radio to Citadel Broadcasting. The sale was completed on June 12, 2007. According to the Citadel page, Citadel considered WDVD an adult-leaning Top 40 station without rap. After several years in the ratings doldrums, the station subsequently saw its share of the Detroit market increase, as they added more pop music from artists such as Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears to their playlist to compete with both Channel 9-5-5 and 98-7 Amp Radio, while rotations of 1980s and 1990s titles were decreased. By June 2012, the station had moved even closer to Adult Top 40 by adding pop-friendly hip-hop artists such as Nicki Minaj, LMFAO, and Flo Rida into rotation. In late 2014, the station tweaked its playlist again, removing many of the more rhythmic- oriented tracks from rotation and re-adding many 1980s and 1990s hits. As a result, Cumulus moved WDVD from Mediabase's Hot AC panel to the Mainstream AC panel, giving Detroit two Mainstream AC reporter stations (along with WNIC), although the station remained closer to Hot AC musically. The station has since returned to the Hot AC panel but continues to play more 1980s music than is the norm for contemporary Hot AC. In addition, the station's slogan of \\"Today's Best Hits\\" has changed as of May 2017 to \\"Today's Best Music.\\" The station's morning show hosts, Allyson Martinek and Blaine Fowler, were featured on the syndicated television program Dish Nation until November 2012. On July 28, 2015, Allyson Martinek was let go from the station, with Blaine Fowler remaining in mornings. Martinek then later joined WNIC in November 2016, exactly one year and four months after she was let go from the station. Competition In addition to its CHR competition, beginning in August 2011, WDVD gained a direct competitor in the Hot AC format as longtime Mainstream AC station WNIC, rebranded as Fresh 100.3, moved to a Hot AC playlist. WNIC returned to its previous AC format a little over a year later and has also since dropped the \\"Fresh\\" name. On the Canadian side of the border, WDVD also directly competes with CHYR-FM for listeners in Windsor and Essex County, Ontario. HD radio In 2007, WDVD revived \\"Planet 96.3\\" and the \\"Alternative Classics\\" format as an offering on its secondary HD Radio channel. This was dropped and replaced by \\"Top 20 New Hits\\", a format focusing on new Adult CHR releases not yet played on the main station. In August 2012, WDVD revived the \\"Planet 96.3\\" name and Modern AC/Classic Alternative format, playing classic alternative songs from the '70s, '80s and '90s, songs that were played on the original Planet 96.3 as currents in the late 1990s, and a few more recent titles. In the spring of 2015, WDVD HD2 flipped formats again, this time to a simulcast of news/talk sister station WJR.

This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans‚Äîlonger than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled \\"anti-art\\". The Dada movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti- art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist Marcel Duchamp around 1914, and his readymades have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects.This is one dictionary definition of anti-art: \\"A loosely used term that has been applied to works or attitudes that debunk traditional concepts of art. The term is said to have been coined by Marcel Duchamp in about 1914, and his ready-mades can be cited as early examples of the genre.

Photograph by Alfred Stieglitz Anti-art can take the form of art or not. It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.Hal Foster. \\"What's Neo about the Neo-Avant- Garde?\\". October, Vol. 70, \\"The Duchamp Effect\\", Autumn, 1994. p. 19. Some instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include monochrome paintings, empty frames, silence as music, chance art. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond‚Äîto include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be readymades, found object art, d√©tournement, combine paintings, appropriation (art), happenings, performance art, and body art. Anti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely. This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through revolutionary activism. An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of readymades. Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of industrial processes in the making of art. Anti- artists may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously.Tilman Osterwold. \\"Pop art\\". Taschen, 2003, p. 44. They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition. Anti- artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of happenings. This is sometimes the case with \\"supertemporal\\" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art.Henry Flynt interviewed by Stewart Home. \\"Towards an Acognitive Culture\\". New York 8 March 1989. Smile 11, London Summer 1989. Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in auto-destructive art. Andr√© Malraux has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures ‚Äì \\"Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating\\" and the like ‚Äì because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti- art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure. Andr√© Malraux's Theory of Art. Amsterdam, Rodopi, 2009. pp.275-286. Theory Anti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and fine art. The philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in \\"Art, an Enemy of the People\\". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe, a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents. The Invention of Art: A Cultural History by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art. \\"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.\\" (Shiner 2003, p. 3) Shiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn. History =Pre World War I= Jean- Jacques Rousseau rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre.North West Arts Association (Great Britain), Alexander Schouvaloff. \\"Place for the arts\\". Seel House Press, 1970, p. 244. Karl Marx posited that art was a consequence of the class system and therefore concluded that, in a communist society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no \\"artists\\".Larry Shiner. The Invention of Art: A Cultural History. University of Chicago Press, 2003, pp. 234, 236, 245, 200px Arguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the Incoherents in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by Jules L√©vy in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented \\"...drawings by people who can't draw...\\"\\"...dessins ex√©cut√©s par des gens qui ne savent pas dessiner...\\" and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of Montmartre cabaret culture. While short lived ‚Äì the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 ‚Äì the movement was popular for its entertainment value. In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades, monochromes, empty frames and silence as music.Alphonse Allais: Marche Fun√®bre Compos√©e pour les Fun√©railles d'un Grand Homme Sourd, 1884.

I am against the word 'anti' because it's a bit like atheist, as compared to believer. And the atheist is just as much of a religious man as the believer is, and an anti-artist is just as much of an artist as the other artist. Anartist would be much better, if I could change it, instead of anti-artist. Anartist, meaning no artist at all. That would be my conception. I don't mind being an anartist ... What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art is still art in the same way as a bad emotion is still an emotion.\\"Duchamp quoted by Dalia Judovitz. \\"Unpacking Duchamp: Art in Transit\\". Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995. \\"No, no the word 'anti' annoys me a little, because whether you are anti or for, it's two sides of the same thing. And I would like to be completely ‚Äì I don't know what you say ‚Äì nonexistent, instead of being for or against... The idea of the artist as a sort of superman is comparatively recent. This I was going against. In fact, since I've stopped my artistic activity, I feel that I'm against this attitude of reverence the world has. Art, etymologically speaking, means to 'make.' Everybody is making, not only artists, and maybe in coming centuries there will be a making without the noticing\\" Tristan Tzara indicated: \\"I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none.\\" Jacques-Yves Conrad, Promenade surr√©aliste sur la colline de Montmartre , at the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle Center for the Study of Surrealism ; retrieved April 23, 2008 In addition, Tzara, who once stated that \\"logic is always false\\", Ion Pop, \\"Un urmuzian: Ionathan X.

In 1921, exhibiting at the 5x5=25 exhibition, Alexander Rodchenko created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting.\\"I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, and yellow. I affirmed: this is the end of painting.\\" ‚Äî Alexander Rodchenko. For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.Rodchenko, A. and V. Stepanova (1975) [1920] 'The Programme of the Productivist Group', in Benton and Benton (eds), pp. 91-2. \\"1. Down with art, long live technical science. 2. Religion is a lie. Art is a lie. 3. Destroy the last remaining attachment of human thought to art. ... 6. The collective art of today is constructive life.\\" =Surrealism= Beginning in the early 1920s, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, Surrealism was ultra-leftist, communist, or anarchist. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. In 1925, the Bureau of Surrealist Research declared their affinity for revolutionary politics.\\"Declaration of January 27, 1925\\". Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925 By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism.\\"Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art\\"Lewis, Helena. Dada Turns Red. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s. Breton and his comrades supported Leon Trotsky and his International Left Opposition for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Leader Andr√© Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. Breton believed the tenets of Surrealism could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm.Andr√© Breton. \\"The first manifesto\\". 1924. Breton's followers, along with the Communist Party, were working for the \\"liberation of man.\\" However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the proletarian struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Louis Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \\"degree of moral competence\\", and theoretical refinements included in the second manifeste du surr√©alisme excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective actionSurrealist Art from Centre Pompidou. Accessed March 20, 2007 By the end of World War II the surrealist group led by Andr√© Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \\"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\\" =Letterism and the Situationist International= Founded in the mid-1940s in France by Isidore Isou, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of 'd√©tournement') in Situationist films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman's The Anticoncept and Debord's Howlings for Sade abandoned images altogether. In 1956, recalling the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of Lettrism, Isidore Isou, developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is exco√∂rdism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small. In 1960, Isidore Isou created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions. In Japan in the late 1950s, Group Kyushu was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see. Other similar anti-art groups included Neo-Dada (Neo- Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), Gutai (Gutai Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by L'Art Informel, these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process. Beginning in the 1950s in France, the Letterist International and after the Situationist International developed a dialectical viewpoint, seeing their task as superseding art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is revolutionary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and surrealism while abolishing both.Guy Debord. \\" The Society of the Spectacle\\". Thesis 187 and 191. 1967. Translation by Ken Knabb in 2002.\\"The positive significance of the modern decomposition and destruction of all art is that the language of communication has been lost. The negative implication of this development is that a common language can no longer take the form of the unilateral conclusions that characterized the art of historical societies ‚Äî belated portrayals of someone else's dialogueless life which accepted this lack as inevitable ‚Äî but must now be found in a praxis that unifies direct activity with its own appropriate language. The point is to actually participate in the community of dialogue and the game with time that up till now have merely been represented by poetic and artistic works.\\" \\"Dadaism and surrealism were the two currents that marked the end of modern art. Though they were only partially conscious of it, they were contemporaries of the last great offensive of the revolutionary proletarian movement, and the defeat of that movement, which left them trapped within the very artistic sphere whose decrepitude they had denounced, was the fundamental reason for their immobilization. Dadaism and surrealism were historically linked yet also opposed to each other. This opposition involved the most important and radical contributions of the two movements, but it also revealed the internal inadequacy of their one-sided critiques. Dadaism sought to abolish art without realizing it; surrealism sought to realize art without abolishing it. The critical position since developed by the situationists has shown that the abolition and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single transcendence of art.\\"Internationale Situationist (no. 1, Paris, June 1958) \\"Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us.\\" The situationists renounced the making of art entirely. The members of the Situationist International liked to think they were probably the most radical,Vincent Kaufman. \\"The Columbia history of twentieth-century French thought\\". Editor: Lawrence D. Kritzman, Columbia University Press, 2007, p. 104. \\"In the view of some (including the principal protagonists of the movement themselves), Situationism was the century's finest and most radical form of subversion.

In 1959 Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio proposed Industrial Painting as an \\"industrial-inflationist art\\"Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio. Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art. Notizie Arti Figurative No. 9 (1959). In French: Internationale Situationniste no.3 (1959). In English: Molly Klein translated the original Italian version into English (1997). \\"The machine may very well be the appropriate instrument for the creation of an industrial-inflationist art, based on the Anti-Patent; the new industrial culture will be strictly \\"Made Amongst People\\" or not at all!

Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.Wolf Vostell, 1972 (Postcard). \\"Duchamp has qualified the object into art. I have qualified life into art.\\"Ben Vautier. \\"Pas d'Art\\" (No art). 1961. In 1962 Henry Flynt began to campaign for an anti-art position.Michel Oren (1993) Anti-Art as the End of Cultural History, Performing Arts Journal, volume 15, issue 2. Flynt wanted avant-garde art to become superseded by the terms of veramusement and brend ‚Äì neologisms meaning approximately pure recreation. In 1963 George Maciunas advocated revolution, \\"living art, anti- art\\" and \\"non art reality to be grasped by all peoples\\".George Maciunas. Fluxus Manifesto, 1963. \\"Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, \\"intellectual\\", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, ‚Äì purge the world of \\"Europanism\\"! [...] PROMOTE A REVOLUTIONARY FLOOD AND TIDE IN ART, [...] promote NON ART REALITY to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals ... FUSE the cadres of cultural, social & political revolutionaries into united front & action.\\" Maciunas strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'A 1965 Inventory list by Maciunas, quoted in Mr Fluxus, p88 In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced art group Black Mask declared that revolutionary art should be \\"an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth\\".Hinderer, Eve. Ben Morea: art and anarchism Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.Stewart Home. \\"The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War\\". Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) . \\"In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events.\\" Later, the Motherfuckers were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts. The BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas. Duchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that \\"the word art etymologically means to do\\", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates \\"purely artificial\\" distinctions of being an artist.Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century edited by Rudolf E. Kuenzli, Francis M. Naumann. Google Books. During the 1970s, King Mob was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other. Stewart Home called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of Gustav Metzger in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As Black Mask had done in the 1960s, Stewart Home disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks. The K Foundation was an art foundation that published a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million pounds in cash. Punk has developed anti-art positions. Some \\"industrial music\\" bands describe their work as a form of \\"cultural terrorism\\" or as a form of \\"anti-art\\". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as nonsense verse. As art Paradoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art.Paul N. Humble. \\"Anti-Art and the Concept of Art\\". In: \\"A companion to art theory\\". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley- Blackwell, 2002, p. 246. \\"the readymade has been appropriated as a theoretical paradigm in much contemporary art-school theory.\\" Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions. Duchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the Stuckists, who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as anti-anti-art.

Consulier Industries spun off their automotive division into Mosler Automotive which then rebranded the car as the Mosler Intruder and Mosler Raptor before production ended in 2000. Mosler replaced the car with the Mosler MT900 in 2001.  History  A Consulier GTP-LX prototype The Consulier GTP, conceived by Warren Mosler in 1985, was a 2200 lb (998 kg) mid-engined sports car built in two series. The first series sold about 70 copies and was powered by a Chrysler 2.2 I4 Turbo II engine producing 175 hp (130 kW). The second series made use of the improved Turbo III version of the same engine, which produced 190 hp (141 kW) and had a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h). Most mechanical components were also sourced from Chrysler. The chassis was a unique fiberglass-and-foam monocoque, the first carbon fiber and Kevlar-bodied vehicle ever to go into production with no structural metal in the body. The GTP Sport was the base model, with the GTP LX adding luxury features such as Recaro seats, VDO instrumentation, Fittipaldi wheels, Alpine sound system, sunroof, leather upholstery, air conditioning, cruise control, power locks, power mirrors, power windows, tilt steering wheel, and wool carpet; options included a security system and car phone. Both versions had full instrumentation, in a plain flat-black panel, with eleven gauges in two sizes. The GTP was successful in IMSA racing for six years, however its excellent power to weight ratio, responsible for its success, effectively made the car unbeatable; the car was eventually saddled by IMSA with a 300-pound weight penalty before being banned entirely in 1991. Somewhere between 60 and 100 Consulier GTPs were built. After Consulier Industries spun off into Mosler Automotive, a few of the cars were produced as hybrids between the GTP, Intruder, and Raptor. Some were modified to accept longitudinal Chevrolet small-block V8 engines, which would eventually be used in the Intruder and Raptor. Two separate companies also modified the GTP and installed electric drive components; one of these, a company named Solar Electric, advertised their version in print ads featuring Leslie Nielsen and sold the vehicles through Neiman Marcus. Rebrand = Mosler Intruder = In 1993, Consulier Industries spun off their automotive division into Mosler Automotive, which focused on high-performance cars. Mosler introduced the Intruder, an updated GTP with a new 300 hp (224 kW) Corvette LT1 V8 engine modified by Lingenfelter. This car raced at the Longest Day of Nelson 24-hour race in 1993 and 1994, winning both years; like the GTP before it the Intruder was also banned from Nelson Ledges after its dominating 1993-1994 performances. In 1996, a 450 hp (336 kW) Lingenfelter Intruder won Car and Driver magazine's One Lap of America. Of the four Intruders built, just one was sold. Another was converted into a GT1 racing car, while the remaining pair were converted into Raptors. =Mosler Raptor= Mosler raptor front In 1997, the Intruder was renamed Raptor after being updated with a V-shaped split windshield that reduced drag. Mosler raptor prototype profile This slightly modified car (which had previously won the 1996 One Lap event) went on to win the same event in 1997 and 1999, after which Car and Driver editor Brock Yates banned it from competing again. This car was also tested by Car and Driver in 1998. In their tests, the car weighed 2773 lb (1258 kg) and featured 446 hp (333 kW) at 5800 rpm and 429 ft¬∑lbf (582 N¬∑m) at 5000 rpm. The Small-Block V8 was again modified by Lingenfelter, and the five-speed transaxle came from a Porsche 911 Turbo. Mosler raptor prototype rear The mechanical components were still sourced mainly from Chrysler as they had been since 1985: for example, the steering wheel came from a Chrysler minivan. The new split windshield caused visibility problems and blocked some of the air vents. The tested performance of the car included a 3.9 second run to 60 mph (97 km/h) and a 12.3 second and 115 mph (185 km/h) sprint through the quarter mile. Top speed was 163 mph (262 km/h), limited by drag. Challenge with C4 Corvette Warren Mosler was so confident in the performance of the GTP that he offered a $25,000 bounty to anyone who could pilot a street-legal production car around any U.S. racetrack faster than his car. Car and Driver took up the challenge, racing a 1988 Consulier GTP Series I Sport against a stock 1991 Chevrolet Corvette around the Chrysler proving grounds test track in Chelsea, Michigan. Arthur St. Antoine and Csaba Csere took three laps each in the Corvette and the GTP. They were able to obtain a best lap of 1:21.01 in the Corvette versus the GTP's best of 1:22.56. Reviewer St. Antoine opined that the GTP was \\"difficult to handle\\" with \\"anemic brakes\\". When Car and Driver confronted Mosler with these results prior to publication, Mosler noted that the test car was three-years- old and worn out due to heavy use: the GTP obtained by Car and Driver was borrowed from a Track Time driver's school: it had worn tires and brake pads, no interior trim, and three cigarette lighters which were specially installed so Track Time could plug in their computer and portable radio equipment. Mosler offered to rerun the test using his company test driver and after installing new brake pads in the GTP, and agreed to pay the $25,000 if the GTP still didn't lap faster than the Corvette. Car and Driver refused, saying it might be faster because of the new driver. Mosler responded that they could use any driver they wanted for their car, but to have them drive the GTP and get paid if it lost was a conflict of interest. Car and Driver subsequently published the Consulier GTP road test article in a negative and sarcastic light, where they ridiculed the borrowed car's lack of interior fit and finish and the three lighter plugs (failing to mention these were modifications made by the driving school), and compared the overall fit and finish negatively with a new Nissan 300ZX. They also claimed that Mosler defaulted on his promise. Supporting Mosler's position that the GTP should have won was the 1991 auto race in Lime Rock Park, with a Series II Consulier GTP. This car defeated Hurley Haywood's factory Porsche 911 Turbo, Boris Said's Callaway Twin Turbo Corvette, and Jim Minnaker's factory ZR1 Corvette; the race would be the GTP's last before it was banned from the IMSA series. To further back up his statements, Mosler raised the challenge to $100,000, however no production car was able to best the Series II Consulier GTP; it has been claimed that Chet Fillip bested the GTP, however he was in a modified RUF Porsche GT1 with racing slicks during his run at the Sebring International Raceway.

Before the advent of electronic navigational aids such as GPS the most reliable way to ascertain north in such circumstances was through the use of an astrocompass. Principle of use The Earth's axis of rotation remains, for all intents and purposes, stationary throughout the year. Thus, with knowledge of the current time and geographical position in the form of latitude and longitude, which are set on the instrument using dials, an astrocompass can be sighted on to any astronomical object with a known position to give an extremely accurate reading. In its most basic form, the astrocompass consists of a base plate marked with the points of the compass, with a mechanism known as an equatorial drum mounted on it. On this drum is a set of adjustable sights and a scale of declination. More advanced versions may have built-in chronometers or default settings for bodies such as the Sun. To use the compass, the base plate is first levelled with the horizon then pointed roughly to what the user believes to be north. The equatorial drum is then tilted in relation to this base according to the local latitude. The sights are then set using the local hour angle and the declination of whatever astronomical body is being used. Once all these settings have been made, the astrocompass is simply turned until the astronomical body is visible in the sights: it will then be precisely aligned to the points of the compass. Because of this procedure, an astrocompass requires its user to be in possession of a nautical almanac or similar astronomical tables, one of its chief disadvantages. Historical uses Astrocompasses only became useful following the invention of the marine chronometer, without which it is almost useless for navigation. Even then, they saw only limited use, with first magnetic compasses and then gyrocompasses being preferred in almost all cases. Polar exploration was one of the fields in which the astrocompass saw the most use, for the reasons described above. They have also been used throughout history in other climes to check the accuracy of other forms of compasses. They saw use, for example, in the North African Campaign of World War 2. GPS and other similar forms of electronic navigation aids mean that the astrocompass is now functionally obsolete anywhere except for areas very close to the poles where GPS coverage is not available and there are no current electronic navigation aids. Operation The operation is as follows: #Getting the local time (by means of a clock) #Setting the latitude #Setting (in the alidade) the star's local hour angle (LHA) for that day obtained by means of tables or a computer program #Pointing the compass pinnula to the star (sun or moon) #Reading the true course on the limb See also *Grid compass *Compass direction using a watch *Solar compass References *'How it Works, Part 6' Marshall Cavendish Limited 1974 Category:Navigational equipment ","title":"Astrocompass"},{"id":"2097175","text":"The subclass Euechinoidea includes almost all living species of sea urchin, and fossil forms going back as far as the Triassic.

He holds the all-time record for most career head coaching wins in af2 history, coaching the Quad City Steamwheelers and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, whom he led to Arena Cup VIII in 2007. His head coaching career also included a partial season coaching the Dallas Vigilantes of the AFL in 2010. High school Ingold attended Seton-La Salle Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was a student and a letterman in football and baseball. In football, he led his team to two W.P.I.A.L. Class AA Championships, and was an All-State selection as a senior. Ingold graduated from Seton LaSalle High School in 1981. College Ingold played college football at the University of South Carolina in 1981. After the season, when there was a coaching change, Ingold transferred to the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, to be closer to home. Ingold's single season at IUP was outstanding, as he set a new Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference record for touchdown passes in a single season. Professional career Ingold made his professional debut in 1987 as the starting Quarterback for the Washington Commandos. Ingold's season stats were best in the league, earning him First Team All-Arena Honors. Ingold quarterbacked the Detroit Drive to an ArenaBowl II victory in 1988. After the league started going through financial struggles following the 1988 season, Ingold said he wouldn't play in 1989 citing, \\"Last year, they played 14 games at $1,000 a game plus $100 per win. This year, there's only four games and they're playing $350 a game plus $50 per win - and you have to pay for your own meals.\\" Coaching career Just one season after retiring, Ingold became the Offensive Coordinator for the Pittsburgh Gladiators. From 2002-2004, Ingold was the head coach of the af2's Quad City Steamwheelers. In 2005, Ingold returned to the AFL ranks when he was named the offensive coordinator for the Dallas Desperados. From 2006-2009, Ingold returned to af2 where he became the head coach of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers. His outstanding record in af2 gave him a chance to become the head coach of the expansion Dallas Vigilantes in 2010. He was fired after a 1-5 start. Personal life Ingold was an avid runner, and competed in both the Pittsburgh and the Quad Cities marathons. In 2006, Ingold was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and missed Pioneers training camp for the 2007 season. Ingold had residences in both Pittsburgh and Dallas with his wife Kristina and their two children, Alexandra and Richie, Jr. Ingold died on February 15, 2017, aged 53.

It can also be used to diagnose the cause of vertigo, dizziness or balance dysfunction by testing the vestibular system. Technique and results The test is performed by attaching electrodes around the nose and measuring the movements of the eye in relation to the ground electrode. The vestibular system monitors the position and movements of the head to stabilize retinal images. This information is integrated with the visual system and spinal afferents in the brain stem to produce the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). ENG provides an objective assessment of the oculomotor and vestibular systems. A newer standard for the recording is the use of infrared video systems which allow for a more detailed observation and analysis of these eye movements, called video nystagmography (VNG). A similar test is performed for testing vertigo by using the caloric reflex test, which can be induced by air or water of specific temperatures, typically ¬± 7 degrees Celsius from body temperature. The standard ENG test battery consists of three parts: * oculomotor evaluation * positioning and positional testing * caloric stimulation of the vestibular system The comparison of results obtained from various subtests of ENG assists in determining whether a disorder is central or peripheral. In peripheral vestibular disorders, the side of lesion can be inferred from the results of caloric stimulation and, to some degree, from positional findings. ENG or VNG can be used to record nystagmus during oculomotor tests such as saccades, pursuit and gaze testing, optokinetics and also calorics (dithermal or monothermal). Abnormal oculomotor test results may indicate either systemic or central pathology as opposed to peripheral (vestibular) pathology. Optokinetics generally are used as a cross-check on abnormal responses to oculomotor tests. Both of these tests use a \\"light bar\\" involving a moving light (usually red) which the patient will track with the eyes. The caloric irrigation is the only vestibular test which allows the clinician to test the vestibular organs individually; however, it only tests one of the three semicircular canals: the horizontal canal. While ENG is the most widely used clinical laboratory test to assess vestibular function, normal ENG test results do not necessarily mean that a patient has typical vestibular function. ENG abnormalities can be useful in the diagnosis and localization of the site of lesion; however, many abnormalities are nonlocalizing; therefore, the clinical history and otologic examination of the patient are vital in formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan for a patient presenting with dizziness or vertigo.

An average of the likely costs which may be incurred in dealing with a breach may be used. Authority for the proposition that averaging is the appropriate approach may be taken from the case of English Hop Growers v Dering, 2 KB 174, CA (1928).Office of Fair Trading, \\"Calculating fair default charges in credit card contracts: A statement of the OFT's position\\", published April 2006, accessed 15 May 2020 When damages are not predetermined/assessed in advance, then the amount recoverable is said to be \\"at large\\" (to be agreed or determined by a court or tribunal in the event of breach). Common law Generally, at common law, a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party... (in which case it is referred to as a penal or penalty clause). One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of specific performance. However, courts sitting in equity will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the unjust enrichment of the enforcing party. For a liquidated damages clause to be upheld, two conditions must be met. # The amount of the damages identified must roughly approximate the damages likely to fall upon the party seeking the benefit of the term. # The damages must be sufficiently certain at the time the contract is made that such a clause will likely save both parties the future difficulty of estimating damages. Damages that are sufficiently uncertain may be referred to as unliquidated damages, and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a contingency. Contracts under common law require there to have been some attempt to create an equal or reasonably proportionate quota between the damages made and the actual loss. Parties must not lose sight of the principal compensation and they must keep the time of execution and the difficulty of the calculations in mind when drafting the contract.https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2278&context;=flr#page=7 Bailey, A. L. and Treiman, D., Defining the Limits of Liquidated Damages Clauses, published 31 December 2014 ;Example Neal Townsend agrees to lease a store-front to Richard Smith, from which Richard intends to sell jewellery. If Townsend breaches the contract by refusing to lease the store-front at the appointed time, it will be difficult to determine what profits Smith will have lost because the success of newly created small businesses is highly uncertain. This, therefore, would be an appropriate circumstance for Smith to insist upon a liquidated damages clause in case Townsend fails to perform. In the case of construction contracts, courts have occasionally refused to enforce liquidated damages provisions, choosing to follow the doctrine of concurrent delay when both parties have contributed to the overall delay of the project. Contracts in the NEC3 family use the term 'low service damages' (optional clause X.17) and generally include a Low Service Damages Schedule.British Institute of Facilities Management, Getting Started with the NEC3 Term Services Contract, accessed 23 June 2015 =The definition and scope extended= In Australia, the definition of liquidated damages applies to the situations where upon the failure of a primary stipulation, imposes a detriment to the first party or a benefit to the second party by a secondary stipulation collateral to the primary stipulation (i.e. it does not have to be a breach).. =Uniform Commercial Code= In the United States, Section 2-718(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods: > Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but > only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or > actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the > inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A > term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty. This largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states. =The law applied to bank and credit card charges= United Kingdom UK bank and credit card customers were being charged as much as ¬£39 for a single transaction taking them over their credit limit. Consumers argued these charges were well beyond the cost of sending a computerised letter. In 2007 the Office of Fair Trading investigated the charges being imposed on customers of credit card companies. In its report, the OFT claimed these charges were unlawful under UK law as they amounted to a penalty. It said it would be prepared to investigate any charge over ¬£12, though this was not intended to indicate that ¬£12 is a fair and acceptable charge. The OFT said it would be up to a court to determine such an amount based on the established legal precedent that the only recoverable cost would be actual costs incurred. The credit card companies did not produce evidence of their actual costs to the OFT, instead insisting their charges are in line with clear policy and information provided to customers. Receipt of liquidated damages and intimately linked with the purpose of the profit-making apparatus, is a capital receipt. The amount received by the assessee towards compensation for sterilization of the profit earning source is not in the ordinary course of business. Hence, it is a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee. In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled (see Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc) that terms in bank account contracts were not capable of being penal, bar those applicable to NatWest Bank customers between 2001 and 2003. The court ruled that the charges were a charge for a service, and not a penalty for damages for breaching a contract term. Australia In 2012, the High Court of Australia allowed an appeal against findings of the Federal Court of Australia that 'exception fees' imposed by the ANZ Bank could not constitute an unenforceable penalty. The High Court found that fees were not incapable of being characterised as penalties merely because they were not charged upon breach of contract. Conversely, in 2014, the federal court (Gordon J) described $35 late payment fees by ANZ Banking Group to customers who failed to make their monthly minimum credit card repayment as being ‚Äúextravagant, exorbitant and unconscionable‚Äù and ordered for these fees to be reimbursed.. ANZ appealed. In 2015, the full court overturned Justice Gordon‚Äôs first instance judgment that credit card late payment fees charged by ANZ to its customers constituted penalties at law and equity (and were therefore largely unenforceable).. The decision otherwise upholds Justice Gordon's findings that honour, dishonour and overlimit fees charged by ANZ were not penalties, unconscionable or unfair. While the decision is very fact specific, it represented a major setback for other class actions based on penalties. Paciocco appealed to the High Court. The last chapter of the bank fees saga took place in July 2016 where the High Court dismissed the appeal for leave and held that the full court was correct to characterise the loss provision costs, regulatory capital costs and collection costs as affecting the legitimate interests of the Bank. The Court asserted that the fact that those categories of costs could not be recovered in an action for damages did not alter that conclusion. Further, neither the fact that the late payment fees were not genuine pre-estimates of damage nor the fact that the amounts charged were disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by itself rendered the late payment fees penalties. High Court Other legal systems =Civil law= Civil law systems generally impose less severe restrictions on liquidated damages. For example, Article 1226 of the French Civil Code provides for clause p√©nale, a variant of liquidated damages which combines compensatory and coercive elements. Judges may adjust excessive contract penalties, but such clauses are not generally void as a matter of French law. Article 420-1 of the Civil Code of Japan provides an even firmer basis to uphold contractual penalties: # The parties may agree on the amount of the liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation. In such case, the court may not increase or decrease the amount thereof. # The liquidated damages shall not preclude the demand for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right. # Any penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages. In the U.S. state of Louisiana, which follows a civil law system, liquidated damages are referred to as \\"stipulated damages\\".Louisiana Civil Code, Article 2005: Parties may stipulate the damages to be recovered in case of nonperformance, defective performance, or delay in performance of an obligation. http://legis.la.gov/Legis/LawSearchList.aspx accessed 23 June 2015 Prior to 1 January 1985, Louisiana law used the term ‚Äúpenal clause‚Äù under former article 2117 of the Civil Code.Louisiana Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Mary Mobley v.

Togo with the Oti River (north) and the Mono River (south) The Mono River is the major river of eastern Togo. Approximately long, and draining a basin of about , it rises between the town of Sokod√© and the border with Benin, and flows south. Along the southern portion of the river towards its mouth, it forms the international boundary between Togo and Benin. The river drains into the Bight of Benin through an extensive system of brackish water lagoons and lakes, including Lake Togo. Only the part of the river nearest its mouth is navigable. Most of the river's basin on the upper tableland is cultivated for maize, yams, rice, cotton and cassava. The river is dammed from its mouth by the Nangbeto Dam, a partnership between Benin and Togo completed in 1987. Studies have reported economic benefits from the dam, including tourism and fishing in the lake behind it. The dam's construction displaced between 7,600 and 10,000 people, however, and studies indicate that it has substantially modified the ecology of the lagoon system at the river's mouth by reducing the natural seasonal fluctuations in river flow. A second dam project, Adjarala Dam, was proposed to be built on the river between Nangbeto and the river's mouth during the 1990s but did not receive financing until 2017 when the China-Africa Development Fund agreed to support the project.Togo First, Togo: CAD Fund to support new development projects , Tuesday, 11 September 2018 19:08 , https://www.togofirst.com/en/investments/1109-1578-togo-cad-fund-to- support-new-development-projects The dam's construction is part of the government's plan to increase Benin's domestic power generation capacity from 20 to 70% as most of Togo and Benin's electricity currently needs to be imported from the Akosombo Dam in Ghana.

National Historic Site The \\"Walled Landscape of Grates Cove\\" was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995. The designated site comprises of grassy landscape containing small gardens demarcated by stone walls. The area represents a rare surviving example of a communal system of land and community organization unique to Newfoundland. The shipwreck of The Mollie The Mollie was a coasting schooner posted out of Carmanville, Newfoundland that was lost near Grates Cove on the evening of December 20, 1944. All people on board were lost. The Mollies Captain was Ross Chaulk, who was 26 years old and unmarried. Lost with him were James Ellsworth, age 25, John Goodyear, age 61 also his two sons Reginald Goodyear, age 32 and Charles Goodyear, age 26, both of them were also unmarried. The last crew member was Otto Hicks of Musgrave Harbour, who was a widower with one child. The cook, Charles Goodyear just 2 years earlier survived another near-miss shipwreck on the schooner L.C. Norman when it ran into the tip of Cape Bonavista. 13 crews of men from Grates Cove made trips to recover the bodies of the crew of The Mollie.

For ever, she has been tracking down interactions between art, literature and society with an intercultural twist. After Sartre : A Life (1987) became an international success, she became French cultural counselor in the US, where she held her position from 1989 to 1992. Life In New York, Cohen-Solal‚Äôs encounter with Leo Castelli led her to shift her interest to the art world. In the frame of a manyfold project which was to become a social history of the US artist, she published Painting American (2001); Leo Castelli & His Circle(2010); New York-Mid Century (2014), with Paul Goldberger and Robert Gottlieb; and Mark Rothko (2013). Annie Cohen-Solal highlights the various networks of actors who gradually made the construction of American art possible. She develops a multiscalar analysis of the configurations that allowed the emergence of an American art. In 2000, this work gave rise to a series of 25 programs for France-Culture: from Frederic Church to Jackson Pollock, the heroic march of American painters. In 2009, at the French Consulate in New York, she was presented with the title of Chevalier dans l'ordre national de la L√©gion d'Honneur , the highest decoration in France, by Ambassador Pierre Vimont. In 2014, she became general curator of Magiciens de la terre 2014 at the Centre Pompidou, publishing Magiciens de la terre : retour sur une exposition l√©gendaire, with Jean-Hubert Martin. As a professor, she has held positions at Tisch School of the Arts (NYU), √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, University of Caen (Normandy), √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, the Freie University of Berlin, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. On the occasion of Sartre's centenary in 2005, her international lecture tour took her to Brazil, where she and Gilberto Gil considered the creation of a Sartre Chair at the University of Brasilia. She then co-directed the organization of the Sartre Night at the ENS, involving students and researchers as philosophers, historians and geographers, and led a research seminar \\"Geopolitics of Sartre\\" (2013). As part of her work on art, artists, intellectual and social circulations, she was commissioned by Leon Black (Jewish Lives at Yale University Press) to write Mark Rothko, also translated into many languages, This work, which follows the social and geographical trajectory of the painter, reveals how this Jewish child who immigrated to the United States at the age of ten, became a true agent of transformation of the country, managing to bring to life in his art the different cultural areas to which he belongs, notably in the Rothko Chapel (Huston, Texas) commissioned by the Menil family and inaugurated in 1971. Always in line with his global vision of artistic flows, the Maeght Foundation in Saint Paul de Vence entrusted her with the essay for the catalog of the exhibition on the artist Christo (2016). With historian Jeremy Adelman (en) (from Princeton University), she was co-director of a group of researchers at Stanford University on the theme \\"Crossing Boundaries\\" in 2015. Since 2015, Annie Cohen-Solal has been a member of the board of directors of Paris College of Art, and a member of the jury of the Latvian Architecture Award. She joins the jury of the Evens Art Prize (Antwerp) in 2016. She is also curator of the Mus√©e Picasso and the Mus√©e de l'Immigration (Paris). Since 2016, continuing to intersect the history of immigration and the history of art, she has focused her research on Picasso, which will result in a book published by Fayard (A foreigner named Picasso), an exhibition at the National Museum of the History of Immigration, in partnership with the Picasso Museum.

Text  ; Latin text: : O magnum mysterium, : et admirabile sacramentum, : ut animalia viderent Dominum natum, : iacentem in praesepio! : Beata Virgo, cujus viscera : meruerunt portare : Dominum Iesum Christum. : Alleluia! ; English translation: : O great mystery, : and wonderful sacrament, : that animals should see the newborn Lord, : lying in a manger! : Blessed is the virgin whose womb : was worthy to bear : the Lord, Jesus Christ. : Alleluia!  History  The image of the oxen and donkey next to the crib is found in Isaiah (Isa. 1.3) and is traditionally related to the nativity scene at the birth of Jesus in Luke 2. Luke (Lk 2.7) does not mention animals, but a manger. In the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, both animals are specifically named. The image continued to spread from the 13th century onwards when it was included in the Golden Legend. It became the most popular symbol for the mystery of the self-abasement of God in his Incarnation. (Phil 2,6‚Äì7). The second part of the responsory relates to the words with which Elizabeth welcomes Mary, mother of Jesus on her visitation (Lk 1.42‚Äì43).  O Magnum Mysterium (Morten Lauridsen)  Composed in 1994 by Morten Lauridsen, American composer. The piece mimics classic Gregorian choral pieces in its style but with some modern influence as well. Speaking of the piece Lauridsen said \\"I wanted this piece to resonate immediately and deeply into the core of the listener, to illumine through sound.\\" The music pulls its lyrics from the responsorial chant shown above. Lauridsen accounts that his inspiration for the piece came from a painting he saw in the Norton Simon Museum titled ‚ÄúStill Life with Lemons, Oranges and a Rose‚Äù (1633) by Spanish Baroque artist Francisco de Zurbar√°n, which Lauridsen said was symbolism for the Virgin Mary. Lauridsen said he worked on the piece over a period of six months and put considerable thinking into a certain dissonant note to comment on the sorrow that the Virgin Mary would later face as her son was killed.

It is the first sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho and the second film in the Psycho franchise. Set 22 years after the first film, it follows Norman Bates after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him. It is unrelated to the 1982 novel Psycho II by Robert Bloch, which he wrote as a sequel to his original 1959 novel Psycho. In preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a one-time student of Hitchcock, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklins's American feature film debut. Psycho II was released on June 3, 1983, and grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from film critics. The film was followed by Psycho III (1986). Plot 22 years after his murder spree, Norman Bates has been cured of his insanity, accepted that his mother is dead, and is released from a mental institution by the court. Marion Crane's sister Lila, the widow of Marion's former lover Sam Loomis, vehemently protests Norman's release, but her plea is dismissed. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman takes up residence in his old home behind the Bates Motel. He reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, where an old lady named Emma Spool works. After work, a young waitress at the diner, Mary Samuels, has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, has been using the motel to deal drugs. He immediately fires Toomey. Norman's assimilation into society appears to be going well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \\"Mother\\" at the house and diner. During a work shift, a drunk Toomey picks a fight with Norman, who suspects him of leaving the messages. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death as he is packing to leave the motel. Becoming increasingly sympathetic to and impressed by Norman's fight to keep his sanity, Mary takes up permanent residence in a guest room at his house. While Norman is renovating the motel, he hears voices in the house, and enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Meanwhile, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window to have sex. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts police. Mary finds Norman in the attic and he shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff arrives and questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. After the sheriff leaves, Norman rebukes her for lying. He fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him. That evening, Mary and Norman find a bloody rag stuffed in the toilet. Norman is horrified, believing he has committed another murder, but Mary insists he is innocent. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, her mother; Lila and Mary have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norman's mother. Mary altered his mother's bedroom and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death. Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and tells Norman that the two of them must be the ones harassing him. He also has the corpse of Norman's mother exhumed, to prove Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Norman is only partially convinced, saying the one behind everything must be his \\"real mother\\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary with what Dr. Raymond told him. She says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse, but Lila will not stop. Later, Norman becomes too terrified to leave his room, saying he saw his real mother in the house. Mary admits to Norman that his sanity is beginning to erode and stays to comfort him. While Lila is retrieving her \\"Mother\\" costume from the cellar, a figure steps out of the shadows and murders her. Meanwhile, the police dredge the swamp and find a car with Toomey's body in the trunk. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. Norman answers the phone and starts speaking to \\"Mother\\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with Norman. While Norman debates with \\"Mother\\" about her command to kill Mary, she runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with butcher knife, in an unsuccessful bid to get Norman to \\"hang up\\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary plunges the butcher knife into his heart. Confronted by the sight of \\"Mother\\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity finally snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Mary backs into the fruit cellar and stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. The ensuing investigation is inconclusive, but in light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as his mother, the police determine Mary most likely committed all the murders. Later, Emma visits Norman and informs him that she is his real mother, and that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Emma was institutionalized. She reveals that she was the real murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. In response, Norman strikes her in the head with a shovel, killing her. He then carries the body upstairs to Mother's room, and begins talking to himself in her voice, signifying that Norman's ‚ÄúMother‚Äù personality has once again taken control of his mind.

Concerned by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work. Australian director Richard Franklin, who was Hitchcock's student and even visited him on the set of Topaz, was hired to direct Psycho II. Universal hired writer Tom Holland to write the screenplay. Hilton A. Green, assistant director of the original Psycho, was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hitchcock and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film; saying that her father would have loved it. Originally, the film was intended as a made-for-cable production. Anthony Perkins originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of Norman Bates, but when he read the script he agreed to do the film. Perkins said, \\"When I received Tom Holland's script, I liked it very much. It was really Norman's story...\\" Before landing Perkins, the studio was exploring recasting the part and Christopher Walken was among those considered. =Filming= Principal photography of Psycho II took place at Universal Studios in Universal City, California on Soundstage 24 from June 30‚ÄìAugust 13, 1982. The Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed. Similarly to the original film, it was mostly shot on the Universal backlot and in a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers John W. Corso and Julie Fletcher, including two Tiffany lamps, the stuffed owl and raven, the brass hands seen in Mrs. Bates's bedroom, the bedroom fireplace, the Victorian bed and armoire, and the 40-foot-long threadbare runner for the staircase. The exterior of the house featured in the original film was relocated to a different section of the Universal Studios lot for the production. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually Courthouse Square, which is probably best known for its appearance in Back to the Future (1985), located on the Universal Studios backlot. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock and the original film. To accomplish this, they added various in-jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on, Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette is visible on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. The final pages of the shooting script were not distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The last shot of the film with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one sheet film poster, director Franklin was not pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home. Reflecting on the shoot, Franklin recalled Perkins as being \\"very generous\\" on-set, and praised Miles as a \\"powerhouse\\" and \\"one of the most forceful\\" actors he had worked with. Music Composer John Williams was considered to do the score for the film, but it was decided to go with composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith was a long-time friend of original film composer Bernard Herrmann. On some film assignments Goldsmith would discover that the director had used some of Herrmann's music from other films as temporary soundtracks. Goldsmith would often joke when he discovered this (\\"Not Benny again!\\");Filmtracks.com when he conducted a rerecording of \\"The Murder\\" for the opening of Psycho II he suggested that Herrmann \\"must be rolling over in his grave\\".Jeff Bond, liner notes, Psycho II soundtrack album, Intrada Special Collection #273. Goldsmith had written a theme for Norman Bates that was rejected but used for the second segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie.The Psycho Legacy MCA Records released a 30-minute album on LP and cassette; in 2014 Intrada issued the complete score. Release When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend at No. 2 (behind Return of the Jedi) and went on to gross over $34 million. =Critical reception= Contemporaneous Variety deemed the film \\"an impressive, 23-years-after followup to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 suspense classic\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has all of the characteristics of a conventional sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic but, as you watch it, you may feel as if you're seeing a couple of precocious film students play with artifacts found in the Hitchcock mausoleum\\". Gary Arnold, writing for The Washington Post, was even less laudatory, referring to the film as \\"a travesty masquerading as a sequel...if Franklin had any respect for the source material, he might feel a little protective and avoid outrages as conceptually, as well as literally, nasty as the treatment of Vera Miles' character. Psycho II transforms her once sympathetic, heroic supporting role into a hateful bit part and then kills her off with a revoltingly obscene flourish. Has movie storytelling broken down this grotesquely in 23 years?\\" A review published in the Detroit Free Press praised the film as \\"jumpy fun\\" and \\"another cult film in the making\\". Christopher John reviewed Psycho II in Ares Magazine #15 and commented that \\"the real importance of Psycho II rests in its originality. Refusing to be just a blood-letting free-for-all, the picture goes to great lengths to create an entirely new story.\\" Retrospective Film scholar John Kenneth Muir praised the film's depiction of Bates in \\"human, realistic terms\\", deeming it \\"admirably frank and sincere\\" and \\"a great film on its own merits\\". In Empire, film critic Kim Newman gave the film three out of five stars, calling Psycho II \\"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\\", writing, \\"The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world wants Norman to be mad, and 'normality' can only be restored if he's got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again\\". On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 59% approval rating and an average rating of 5.27/10 based on 34 reviews. The site's consensus states; \\"Although it can't hold a cleaver to the classic original, Psycho II succeeds well enough on its own merits to satisfy horror fans.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that, while the film sustained the suspenseful atmosphere of the original and is better than the average slasher film, the film was too heavy on the plot and was too willing to cheat about its plot to be successful. Home media Psycho II has been released five times on DVD. The initial release came in 1999 when Universal Pictures leased the film out to GoodTimes Home Video in a 1.33:1 open matte transfer. The second release came in 2005 from Universal itself. The third release came in 2007 as part of a triple feature package with Psycho III and Psycho IV: The Beginning. Shout Factory, under their Scream Factory logo, released Psycho II on DVD & Blu-Ray on September 24, 2013 under their \\"Collector's Edition\\" line-up.

Background  Pere was a participant in the Te Kooti's War, one of the New Zealand Wars. When Te Kooti's forces were defeated at the siege of Ngatapa, in 1869, around 270 people were taken prisoner. Along with four other survivors (Hetariki Te Oikau, Matene Te Karo, Rewi Tamanui Totitoti, and Wi Tamararo), Pere was taken to Wellington, where he was put on trial for high treason against the British crown. Pere and Tamararo were also charged with murder. Three of the accused, Te Oikau, Te Karo, and Totitoti, began their trial on 20 September 1869, and were found guilty after four days. They were sentenced to be hanged, then beheaded, and then quartered -- this was the mandatory sentence for treason, although the judge indicated that perhaps the beheading and quartering would not actually be carried out. Pere and Tamararo were to be tried separately, as they were accused of murder as well as treason. Tamararo's trial began on 27 September, although treason charges were dropped, leaving only charges of murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to the same punishment as the others.  Trial and execution  When Pere himself began his trial, the murder charges were dropped, leaving only the charge of treason. Pere's defence focused on three primary claims: *That Pere had been conscripted into Te Kooti's army by force. *That even if Pere hadn't been conscripted, the cause he saw himself as fighting for (resisting the encroachment of those who were stealing his land) was just. *That Pere did not realise that Britain regarded itself as sovereign over New Zealand, and that he, therefore, did not understand himself to be committing treason. Pere was supported in his trial by Maata Te Owai, one of Te Kooti's wives. Te Owai testified that Pere had not joined Te Kooti's forces willingly. Other evidence indicated that Pere had been present when several murders of colonists took place, although no uncorroborated evidence was presented that Pere had actually committed or condoned the crime. (Oddly, this evidence better fits the charge of murder than the charge of treason, but it was the charge of murder that was abandoned.) In the end, Pere was found guilty of treason. The judge deferred Pere's sentencing for a time, but eventually ordered the same punishment as for the others. Wi Tamararo had committed suicide two days after being sentenced, leaving only four of the convicted alive. Later, on 13 October, the Governor chose to commute the sentence of Hetariki Te Oikau to life imprisonment. On 2 November, a surprise decision also commuted the sentences of Matene Te Karo and Rewi Tamanui Totitoti. This left Pere as the only person facing execution. Addressing Pere's case directly, the Executive Council claimed that Pere's participation in the war had been voluntary, and accused him of active involvement in murders of colonists. It also said that Pere, unlike some others, had no tribal allegiances which compelled him to participate. Pere was hanged in Wellington on 16 November 1869. He is the only New Zealander ever to be executed on charges of treason, with all other executees having been convicted of murder. As capital punishment in New Zealand is no longer in effect, he is expected to retain this distinction permanently.  Recent re-examinations  More recently, Hamiora Pere's case has been re-examined, with some claiming that he was treated unfairly. It has been alleged that if the three other accused had their sentences commuted, Pere should have been treated the same way -- there was no corroborated evidence that Pere had actually committed murder. (It is argued that the Crown realised this, and that this is why the separate murder charge was dropped.) According to some theories, Pere was executed not because he was deemed to have deserved it, but because the government \\"needed someone to hang\\" to satisfy public opinion or to serve as an example. Wi Tamararo, against whom the strongest evidence of murder was presented, deprived the government of a hanging by committing suicide, leaving Pere as the only real candidate. In the minutes of the Executive Council, an opinion was noted that \\"one execution will be [as] useful as more would have been by way of example and caution\\".

Her life only changes for the worse when elf boy Tien comes along and he thinks Kana is an elf too! Tien gets Kana into a trap in the girl's bathroom, which is a portal to his home world Sokora. It is under siege by a demonic army. Then she gets herself into more mishaps, when her body is time-shared by a powerful elf sorceress. Along the way, Kana meet Tien's brother and the Nymph girl, Salome. She now has the job of saving Sokora. She did not really want to, but Kana may be the only hope for Sokora, if only she can stop being so lazy. Characters *Kana : She is the main character of the story. Known for over-sleeping, lack of homework completion, and junk food eating habits, she will do anything to get her old life back. She \\"time-shares\\" her body with Veila. Blushing turns her into the much more attractive elf. *Tamara : One of Kana's roommates, this athletic girl will take any challenge that crosses her path. *Veila : A powerful elf sorceress forced to enter and time-share Kana's body. Veila is also extremely attractive and wears scanty clothing. Veila's goal is to save Sokora from evil forces. She is very mature and sensible, the direct opposite to Kana, and is often of no help in difficult situations. *Tien : An arrogant, talented elf refugee from Sokora. Tien thinks Kana is an elf too. Tristan envies his magical talents. He is very self-centered and has made is very clear he dislikes the human girls and Salome. He is constantly put down by others, who are very aware of his magical talents. *Griever : This goyle serves the demonic army that invaded Sokora. He wears bandages around his hands. If his hands touch the bare skin of any mortal, the mortal turns to stone. *Julie: Another one of Kana's roommates, she is patient, intelligent and prone to have an unusually positive attitude, even in bad situations. Julie is almost a mother figure to her roommates. *Salome: A raccoon nymph girl who only wanted to cozy up to Tien's older brother, Tristan. Unfortunately for her, he does not seem to return the love. She is very protective of Tristan, and will attack any girl who acts too friendly towards him, even if they are trying to help him. She usually ends her sentences with the sound \\"tk\\". *Tristan: He is a rather weak elf compared to his enemies, though he can use a sword and a bow. He prefers to die than lose his \\"honor\\". He is the older, bossy brother of Tien. He saw Kana (in Veila's body) topless and has since done all he can to win the affection of his 'Lady Veila'. Kana has led him to believe that Viela is creating a master spell to save Sokora. *Kogurai: A vampire who wants to return to his homeland.

The crews of nearby ships felt the initial explosion and a second, much larger, explosion; yet the Russian Navy did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the sub for more than six hours. Because the submarine's emergency rescue buoy had been intentionally disabled during an earlier mission, it took more than 16 hours to locate the sunken boat. Over four days, the Russian Navy repeatedly failed in its attempts to attach four different diving bells and submersibles to the escape hatch of the submarine. Its response was criticised as slow and inept. Officials misled and manipulated the public and news media, and refused help from other governments. President Vladimir Putin initially continued his vacation at a seaside resort; he authorised the Russian Navy to accept British and Norwegian offers of assistance after five days had passed since the accident. Seven days after the sinking, British and Norwegian divers finally opened a hatch to the escape trunk in the boat's flooded ninth compartment but found no survivors. The Government of Russia and the Russian Navy were intensely criticised over the incident and their responses. Overview Most of the wreck was raised and analyzed. The official investigation concluded that, as the crew of Kursk was preparing to load a dummy 65‚Äì76 \\"Kit\\" torpedo, a faulty weld in its casing leaked high-test peroxide (HTP), causing the torpedo's kerosene fuel to explode. The explosion blew off both the inner and outer tube doors, ignited a fire, destroyed the bulkhead between the first and second compartments, damaged the control room in the second compartment, and incapacitated or killed the control room crew. The torpedo manufacturer challenged this hypothesis, insisting that its design would prevent the kind of event described. Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev drew attention to systemic faults in the Russian Navy, such as the risky use of highly volatile HTP torpedoes, known to have exploded and caused the sinking of . Ryazantsev accused the Russian navy of failing to properly train the crew, who did not appear to have properly closed the internal tube hatch cover. Eventually, the commission concluded that poor oversight, budget cuts, and incomplete maintenance inspections contributed to the explosion. Two minutes and fifteen seconds after the initial blast, the sub had reached the sea floor when the intense initial fire triggered the detonation of between five and seven torpedo warheads. The second explosion was equivalent to over two tonnes of TNT. It collapsed the bulkheads between the first three compartments and all the decks, tore a large hole in the hull, destroyed compartment four, and killed everyone still alive forward of the nuclear reactor in the fifth compartment. The nuclear reactors shut down safely. Following salvage operations, analysts concluded that 23 sailors in the sixth through ninth compartments reached refuge in the small ninth compartment and survived for more than six hours. As oxygen ran low, crew members attempted to replace a potassium superoxide chemical oxygen cartridge, which accidentally fell into the oily sea water and exploded on contact. The resulting fire killed several crew members and triggered a flash fire that consumed the remaining oxygen, suffocating the remaining survivors. Lacking information, families of the victims engaged in an angry and volatile meeting with newly elected President Vladimir Putin. The video coverage of the meeting was sanitised for Russian audiences but leaked to international media. Russian audiences were shocked when they later saw this footage, which showed a distraught wife and mother being forcibly sedated before she was removed from the meeting. Mammoet was awarded the salvaging contract in May 2001, with the winter weather starting in early October. Within a 3-month period, over 3,000 tons of custom-made equipment was designed, fabricated, installed and commissioned onto a barge which was mobilized to the Barents Sea in August to raise the hull. Using the specialized equipment, they recovered all but the bow, including the remains of 115 sailors, who were buried in Russia. More than two years after the sinking, the Russian government completed a 133-volume, top-secret investigation of the disaster. They released only a four-page summary through Rossiyskaya Gazeta, that revealed \\"stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment\\", and \\"negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement\\". Moreover, they concluded that the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed and that the Russian Navy was completely unprepared to respond to the disaster. Naval exercise 747 jumbo jet, and one of the largest submarines in the Russian Navy. On the morning of 12 August 2000, Kursk was in the Barents Sea, participating in the \\"Summer-X\\" exercise, the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in more than a decade, and also its first since the fall of the Soviet Union. It consisted of 30 ships and three submarines. Kursk had recently won a citation for its excellent performance and been recognised as having the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet. Although this was an exercise, Kursk loaded a full complement of conventional combat weapons. It was one of the few submarines authorised to carry a combat load at all times. This included 18 SS-N-16 \\"Stallion\\" anti-submarine missiles and 24 SS-N-19/P-700 Granit \\"Shipwreck\\" cruise missiles, which were designed to defeat the best naval air defences. Kursk had a mythical standing. It was reputedly unsinkable and there were claims it would withstand a direct hit from a torpedo. The outer hull was constructed using steel plate covered by up to of rubber, which minimised other submarines' or surface vessels' ability to detect the submarine. The inner pressure hull was made of high-quality steel plate. The two hulls were separated by a gap. The inner hull was divided into nine water-tight compartments. The boat was as long as two jumbo jets. At 08:51 local time, Kursk requested permission to conduct a torpedo training launch and received the response \\"\\" (\\"Good\\"). After considerable delay, the submarine was set to fire two dummy torpedoes at the . At 11:29 local time, the torpedo room crew loaded the first practice Type 65 \\"Kit\\" torpedo, (Russian: , or \\"fat girl\\", because of its size), without a warhead, into Kursks number 4 torpedo tube on the starboard side. It was long and weighed . =Initial seismic event detected= Norwegian Seismic Array seismic readings at three locations of the explosions on the submarine Kursk on 12 August 2000. At 11:29:34 (07:29:50 GMT), seismic detectors at the Norwegian seismic array (NORSAR) and in other locations around the world recorded a seismic event of magnitude 1.5 on the Richter scale. The location was fixed at coordinates , north-east of Murmansk, approximately from Norway, and from the Kola Peninsula. =Secondary event= At 11:31:48, two minutes and 14 seconds after the first, a second event, measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, or 250 times larger than the first, was registered on seismographs across northern Europe and was detected as far away as Alaska. The second explosion was equivalent to 2‚Äì3 tons of TNT. The seismic data showed that the explosion occurred at the same depth as the sea bed. The seismic event, triangulated at , showed that the boat had moved about from the site of the initial explosion. It was enough time for the submarine to sink and remain on the sea floor for a short period. Rescue response The crew of the submarine Karelia detected the explosion but the captain assumed that it was part of the exercise. Aboard Pyotr Velikiy, the target of the practice launch, the crew detected a hydro-acoustic signal characteristic of an underwater explosion and felt their hull shudder. They reported the phenomenon to fleet headquarters but their report was ignored. The scheduled time period for Kursk to complete the practice torpedo firing expired at 13:30 without any contact from the sub. Accustomed to the frequent failure of communications equipment, Fleet Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Popov aboard Pyotr Velikiy was not initially alarmed. The ship dispatched a helicopter to look for Kursk but it was unable to locate the sub on the surface; this was reported to Popov. DSRV AS-28 Priz The Northern Fleet duty officer notified the head of the fleet's search and rescue forces, Captain Alexander Teslenko, to stand by for orders. Teslenko's primary rescue ship was a 20-year-old former lumber carrier, Mikhail Rudnitsky, which had been converted to support submersible rescue operations. Teslenko notified the ship's captain to be ready to depart on one hour's notice. Berthed at the primary Northern Fleet base at Severomorsk, the ship was equipped with two AS-32 and AS-34 , a diving bell, underwater video cameras, lifting cranes, and other specialised gear. But she was not equipped with stabilisers capable of keeping the vessel in position during stormy weather and could lower her rescue vessels only in calm seas. The Russian Navy had previously operated two s, each of which carried a pair of Poseidon class DSRVs that could reach a depth of , but due to a lack of funds, the vessels had been held since 1994 in a St. Petersburg yard for pending repairs. At 17:00, an Ilyushin 38 aircraft was dispatched. The crew spent three hours unsuccessfully searching for Kursk. At 18:00, more than six hours after the initial explosion, Kursk failed to complete a scheduled communication check. The Northern Fleet command became concerned and tried to contact the boat. After repeated failures, at 18:30 they began a search and rescue operation, dispatching additional aircraft to locate the submarine, which again failed to locate the boat on the surface. At 22:30, the Northern Fleet declared an emergency, and the exercise was stopped. Between fifteen and twenty-two vessels of the Northern Fleet, including about 3,000 sailors, began searching for the submarine. The Mikhail Rudnitsky left port at 00:30. =Official government response= The Russian Navy initially downplayed the incident. Late on Saturday night, nine hours after the boat sank, Northern Fleet commander Admiral Popov ordered the first search for the submarine. Twelve hours after it sank, Popov informed the Kremlin, but Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev did not notify Putin until 07:00 Sunday morning. Sergeyev \\"did not recommend\\" that Putin visit the disaster site. On Sunday, after Popov already knew that Kursk was missing and presumed sunk, he briefed reporters on the progress of the naval exercise. He said the exercise had been a resounding success and spoke highly of the entire operation. =Rumours among family members= Early on Sunday morning, 13 August, at the Vidyaevo Naval Base, rumours began to circulate among family members of Kursks crew that something was wrong. A telephone operator handled an unusual volume of calls and overheard that a submarine was in trouble and the boat's name. As the base was very small, news spread quickly. Wives and family members exchanged news, but information was scarce. Because Kursk was regarded as unsinkable, family members wished to discount the worst of the rumours. They hoped that Kursk was merely experiencing a temporary communication problem. The deputy base commander assured the women that the headquarters office was half empty and that the officers present were just \\"passing the time.\\" =Foreign assistance refused= On the afternoon of the explosion, before the Kremlin had been informed of the submarine's sinking, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Defense Secretary William Cohen were told that Kursk had sunk. Once officially informed, the British government, along with France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Norway offered help, and the United States offered the use of one of its two deep submergence rescue vehicles, but the Russian government refused all foreign assistance. Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev told the American Embassy that the rescue was well under way. The Russian Navy told reporters that a rescue was imminent. =Russian rescue efforts falter= At 04:50 on Sunday, 13 August, personnel aboard Pyotr Velikiy detected two anomalies on the seabed that might be the boat. At 09:00 Mikhail Rudnitsky arrived at the location. While setting anchor, its crew interpreted an acoustic sound as an SOS from the submarine, but soon concluded the noise had been produced by the anchor chain striking the anchor hole. At 11:30, Mikhail Rudnitsky prepared to lower the AS-34, which entered the water at 17:30. At 18:30, at a depth of and at a speed of , the AS-34 reported colliding with an object, and through a porthole the crew saw the Kursks propeller and stern stabiliser. As the AS-34 was damaged by the collision and had to surface, the crew of Mikhail Rudnitsky began preparing the AS-32 for operation. At 22:40, the AS-32 entered the water and began searching for Kursk. It was unable to locate the submarine, because it had been given an incorrect heading by personnel aboard Pyotr Velikiy. Crew aboard Mikhail Rudnitsky tried to contact Kursk and briefly thought they heard an acoustic SOS signal, but this was determined to be of biological origin. They reported the sounds to Pyotr Velikiy. The AS-32 returned to the surface at 01:00 on Monday morning, 14 August. The salvage tug Nikolay Chiker (SB 131) arrived early in the rescue operation. Using deep water camera equipment it obtained the first images of the wrecked submarine, which showed severe damage from the sub's bow to its sail. Kursk was listing at a 25-degree angle and down 5‚Äì7 degrees by the bow. The bow had ploughed about deep into the clay seabed, at a depth of . The periscope was raised, indicating that the accident occurred when the submarine was at a depth of less than . The AS-34 was repaired and was launched at 05:00 on Monday. At 06:50, the AS-34 located Kursk and unsuccessfully tried to attach to the aft escape trunk over Kursks ninth compartment. Unable to create the vacuum seal necessary to attach to the escape trunk, its batteries were quickly depleted and the crew was forced to surface. No spare batteries were available, so the crew was forced to wait while the batteries were recharged. Meanwhile, winds increased, blowing to , and the waves rose to 3‚Äì4 points (), forcing the Russians to suspend rescue operations. =First official announcement= The first official announcement of the accident was made by the Russians on Monday, 14 August. They told the media that Kursk had had \\"minor technical difficulties\\" on Sunday. They stated that the submarine had \\"descended to the ocean floor\\", that they had established contact with the crew and were pumping air and power to the boat, and that \\"everyone on board is alive.\\" The BBC reported that the Kursk crew \\"had been forced to ground\\" the submarine because it \\"[had] broken down during exercises,\\" but rescue crews were \\"in radio contact with surface vessels.\\" =Collision initially blamed= Senior officers in the Russian Navy offered a variety of explanations for the accident. Four days after Kursk sank, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief and Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated the accident had been caused by a serious collision. Vice-premier Ilya Klebanov said the submarine might have hit an old World War II mine. He also said that almost all of the sailors had died before the vessel hit bottom. The Russian government convened a commission, chaired by vice-premier Ilya Klebanov, on 14 August, two days after Kursk sank. Nearly half of the commission members were officials with a stake in the outcome of the investigation. Independent investigators were not invited to take part, giving the appearance that the commission's findings might not be impartial. =Weather delays efforts= Bad weather, waves, strong undersea currents, and limited visibility impaired the rescue crews' ability to conduct operations on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday Mikhail Rudnitsky lowered a diving bell twice but were unable to connect to the sub. They also tried and failed to manoeuvre a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) onto the rescue hatch. At 20:00 Tuesday, AS-34 was launched again but was damaged when it struck a boom as it was being lowered into the sea. It was brought back aboard, repaired, and relaunched at 21:10. On Tuesday, 15 August, three days after the sinking, the crane ship PK-7500 arrived with the more manoeuvrable Project 18270 Bester-type DSRV (AC-36). But the weather prevented the PK-7500 from launching the DSRV. The rescue team decided to launch the submersible near the coast and tow it to the rescue site with a salvage tug. On Wednesday, 16 August, at 00:20, AS-34 twice attempted to attach to the ninth compartment escape hatch but was unsuccessful. It surfaced and, as it was being lifted onto the deck of the mother ship, its propulsion system was seriously damaged. The crew of Mikhail Rudnitsky cannibalised the AS-32 to repair the AS-34. Rescue operations were suspended while the repairs were made. PK-7500 arrived from the coast where it had launched its DSRV. It repeatedly lowered the rescue vessel to the submarine but it was unable to latch onto an escape hatch. One of the rescue capsules was damaged by the storm. On Thursday at 12:00, Popov reported to the General Staff of the Navy that no explosion had occurred on the Kursk, that the sub was intact on the seafloor, and that an \\"external influence\\" might have caused a leak between the first and second compartments. On Thursday the Russian Priz DSRV made another attempt to reach the aft area of the submarine, but it was unable to create the vacuum seal necessary to attach to the escape trunk. Western media criticised the Russians' 32-hour response time; however, the standard for deploying a recovery vessel in 2000 was 72 hours. The rescue ship Altay attempted to attach a Kolokol diving bell to the sub but was unsuccessful. Russian Navy Headquarters in Moscow told media that rescuers had heard tapping from within the boat's hull, spelling \\"SOS ... water\\", although the possibility of hearing tapping through the double hull was later discounted. Other reports said the sounds had been misinterpreted or were made up. Rescue divers did not attempt to tap on the hull to signal potential survivors acoustically. However, video evidence seems to suggest otherwise, as it shows Norwegian divers tapping on the aft rescue hatch while the rescue part of the operation was still underway. Fragments of both the outer and inner hulls were found nearby, including a piece of Kursks nose weighing , indicating a large explosion in the forward torpedo room.Russian navy salvage team recovers large fragment of Kursks bow Associated Press Worldstream =British and Norwegian help= The British deep submersible rescue vehicle LR5 Private media and state-owned Russian newspapers criticised the navy's refusal to accept international assistance. Five days after the accident on 17 August 2000, President Putin accepted the British and Norwegian governments' offer of assistance. Six teams of British and Norwegian divers arrived on Friday, 18 August. The Russian 328th Expeditionary rescue squad, part of the Navy's office of Search and Rescue, also provided divers. On 19 August at 20:00, the Norwegian ship Normand Pioneer arrived with the British rescue submarine LR5 on board, seven days after the disaster. On Sunday 20 August, the Norwegians lowered a ROV to the submarine. They found that the first of the boat was a mass of twisted metal and debris. Russian Navy officials imposed specific constraints that restricted the Norwegian divers to work on the stern of the boat, specifically the escape hatch over compartment nine and an air control valve connected to the rescue trunk. The Norwegian deep-sea divers protested against the restrictions, which they believed impeded their rescue operations. When the divers attempted to open the air control valve, it would not move. Russian experts on one of the most technologically advanced submarines in the Russian fleet told the divers that they must open the valve counter-clockwise or they would break it. The divers finally went against the experts' advice and tried turning it clockwise, which worked. The divers tried to use the arms of the ROV to open the hatch but were unsuccessful until the morning of Monday, 21 August; they found the rescue trunk full of water. That morning, they used a custom tool to open the internal hatch of the rescue trunk, releasing a large volume of air from the ninth compartment. Divers lowered a video camera on a rod into the compartment and could see several bodies. The salvage companies agreed that the Norwegian divers would cut the holes in the hull but only Russian divers would enter the submarine. The Norwegian divers cut a hole in the hull of the eighth compartment to gain access, using a cutting machine that shoots a high-velocity water-and-cutting- grit mix at pressure. The Russian divers entered the wreck and opened a bulkhead hatch to compartment nine. They found that dust and ashes inside compartment nine severely restricted visibility. As they gradually worked their way inside the compartment and down two levels, Warrant Officer Sergei Shmygin found the remains of Captain-lieutenant Dmitry Kolesnikov. All of the men had clearly been badly burned. The divers cut additional holes in the hull over the third and fourth compartments. The Russian divers removed secret documents and eventually recovered a total of 12 bodies from the ninth compartment. This contradicted earlier statements made by senior Russian officials that all of the submariners had died before the submarine hit the bottom. They also found the boat's log, but had to suspend work because of severe weather. The rescue teams conducted ongoing measurements of radiation levels inside and outside the submarine, but none of the readings exceeded normal ranges. On 21 August, after the Norwegian divers confirmed that no one was alive in the ninth compartment, the Chief of Staff of the Russian Northern Fleet, Mikhail Motsak, announced to the public that the Kursk was flooded and all of its crewmembers had died. Admiral Popov, commander of the Northern Fleet, also addressed the public in a televised broadcast (at the end of which he removed his navy beret) and asked the Kursk family members for forgiveness: \\"...forgive me for not bringing back your boys.\\" Additional plans were made to continue to remove the bodies, but the Russian Navy could not agree on a contract with a foreign company. The families of those who died on the submarine protested that they did not want additional lives put at risk to bring up the dead. On 22 August, President Putin issued an executive order declaring 23 August a day of mourning. =Russians claim collision with NATO submarine= On Monday 14 August, Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated the accident had been caused by a serious collision with a NATO submarine, although he gave no evidence to support his statement. Senior commanders of the Russian Navy repeated this false account for more than two years after the disaster. Many who desired a continuance of negative relations between Russia and the West supported this scenario. During the original exercise, the Russians required each of their submarines to stay within a specified area. This protocol was intended to eliminate the possibility of a collision and to allow surface ships to detect the presence of a Western spy sub. On 29 or 30 August 2000, an official government commission tasked with investigating the disaster announced that the likely cause of the sinking was a \\"strong 'dynamic external impact' corresponding with the 'first event'\\", probably a collision with a foreign submarine or a large surface ship, or striking a World War II mine. They said that the exercise had been monitored by two American submarines‚Äî and ‚Äîand the Royal Navy . When the exercise was cancelled due to the accident, these vessels put in at European ports. Size and mass comparison of Kursk and USS Toledo, which is less than half of Kursks displacement United States Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen responded to Russian accusations of a collision with a submarine at a press conference in Tokyo on 22 September 2000. While the official inquiry was still under way, on 25 October 2000, Commander of the Northern Fleet Popov and his Chief of Staff Motsak were interviewed by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo. They repeated the theory that Kursk collided with a NATO submarine shadowing the exercise. Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated again on 25 October that he was 80 percent certain the accident was caused by a collision with a foreign submarine. There had been 11 collisions between submarines in the Barents Sea since 1967. The Russian navy produced video footage of the wreck that they claimed showed evidence that this, too, resulted from a collision. On 5 November, a representative of the Northern Fleet General Staff told the Russian NTV television station that the sinking was caused by a collision. Admiral Mikhail Motsak repeated this assertion on 17 November in an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia. Officials insisted that an American submarine was closely shadowing Kursk and had caused the collision by getting too close. The Russian Navy produced satellite imagery of the U.S. submarine Memphis docked at a Norwegian naval base in Bergen just after the alleged collision and claimed this proved the submarine had surfaced for repairs, but the authenticity of the photos was never proven. But geophysicists who analysed the seismic signals concluded and reported in February 2001 that the initial sound recorded was triggered by an explosion and not a collision with another vessel. The seismic waveforms of the second event, known by then to be from the explosion of several torpedo warheads, also generated a high-frequency bubble signature characteristic of an underwater explosion of approximately 3‚Äì7 tons of TNT. When analysts compared the second event with the first, they concluded that the first event was also the explosion of a torpedo. Britain's Blacknest seismic monitoring station, which studies seismic signals generated by underground nuclear explosions and earthquakes, identified two distinct explosions. They determined that the two shockwaves were a perfect match and consistent with a torpedo explosion. =Criticism of government response= While the rescue crews repeatedly failed to attach to the rescue trunk and to contact potential survivors aboard the submarine, President Putin was shown on TV enjoying himself on a summer holiday at a villa on the Black Sea. His seeming indifference outraged the families of the Kursk sailors and many other Russians. Amelia Gentleman in The Guardian wrote: The Russian media strongly criticised the government's response to and handling of the sinking. Images of angry family members demanding information or waiting anxiously at the dock for news were shown on media worldwide. Some relatives said they learned of the disaster only from the public media or from conflicting rumours circulating at the navy base. They complained they did not receive any information from the government on the status of the disaster or rescue efforts until Wednesday, five days after the sinking. Some were unable to confirm whether their family members were among the crew on board the boat. The government refused to release a list of the missing sailors even to the families of those aboard; a Pravda reporter paid an officer 18,000 rubles to get the list. Even then, the government tried to prohibit reporters from contacting family members. The continued problems that the rescuers had in reaching potential survivors and ongoing conflicting information about the cause of the accident inflamed Russian public opinion. Media described the Russian government's response to the disaster as \\"technically inept\\" and their stories as \\"totally unreliable\\". =Putin meets with families= President Putin in a contentious meeting with relatives of the dead sailors in Vidyayevo, during which the families complained about the Russian Navy's response to the disaster President Putin had been advised by the military from the start of the disaster that they had the situation under control and that he did not need to intervene. He was told that there was a strong possibility that a foreign vessel had caused the accident and that Russia should not accept help from foreign powers. Only four months into his tenure as President, Putin was highly criticised by the public and media for his decision to remain at a seaside resort, and his once highly favourable ratings dropped dramatically. The President's response appeared callous and the government's actions looked incompetent. On Tuesday, 22 August, 10 days after the sinking, Putin met at 8 p.m. in the Vidyayevo navy base officers' club and cultural centre with about 400‚Äì600 angry and grieving residents of the navy base and about 350 family members of the Kursks crew. The meeting was closed and access was tightly controlled. Two Russian journalists from Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Kommersant, who posed as family members, witnessed distraught widows and mothers howling at Putin, demanding to know why they were receiving so much conflicting information and who was going to be punished for the deaths of their family members. They cried: * Do you believe our men are still alive? * Why have you murdered our lads? * When would the bodies of the submariners be brought home? * When will we get them back, dead or alive? * Who are you going to punish for their deaths, and how? The hostile, contentious meeting lasted for three to six hours. German television channel RTL provided the Russian national daily newspaper Kommersant with an unedited transcript. The transcript revealed that Putin told the families that Admiral of the Fleet Vladimir Kuroyedov had agreed to accept foreign assistance as soon as it was offered on Wednesday, 16 August, but he was shouted down as soon as he offered this explanation. The family members knew from media reports that foreign assistance had been offered on Monday. Up to this point, family members had received 1,000 (rubles, about USD$37 in 2000) in compensation. Putin also offered the families additional compensation equivalent to ten years' salary, about US$7,000 at the time. Mother forcibly sedated The Russian state channel RTR was the only media granted access. Their severely edited broadcast of the meeting showed only the president speaking, eliminating the many emotional and contentious encounters between the President and family members. Their single TV camera fed its signal to a satellite truck on loan to RTR from the German TV Company RTL, and RTL recorded the entire event. During the meeting, Nadezhda Tylik, the mother of Kursk submariner Lt. Sergei Tylik, was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting. She harangued Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov, accusing them of lying to the family members. She told them, \\"You better shoot yourselves now! We won't let you live, bastards!\\" When she would not be quiet, a nurse in civilian apparel behind her forcibly injected her through her clothing with a sedative. She quickly lost the ability to speak and was carried out. Immediately after his wife was given the injection, Tylik's husband said he had asked the nurse to give his wife the drug \\"because she was prone to excessive emotions\\". Four months later, Nadezhda Tylik said that her husband had lied about the injection to the public to \\"save my nerves\\" and that he , \\"did not ask for help\\". Tylik later said, \\"The injection was done to shut my mouth. Immediately after it, I just lost the ability to speak and was carried out.\\" The whole scene was captured by the TV crew, but it was not televised within Russia. Foreign media showed Tylik being removed by officials from the meeting. Tylik later criticised President Putin because he \\"did not answer direct questions\\" at the meeting. \\"Maybe he did not know what to say. But we did not receive concrete answers to concrete questions,\\" she said. Tylik told the St. Petersburg Times that she would go to any lengths to learn the truth about the submarine disaster \\"They told us lies the whole time, and even now we are unable to get any information,\\" she said. Russians and observers in the West were shocked by the incident and feared that the public sedation of a crew member's mother meant that the former Soviet Union was returning to Cold War-era methods of silencing dissent. Tylik said that her son had told her six days before the disaster that the submarine had death onboard', but he did not explain what he meant.\\" She said, \\"I am sure that the commanders of the Northern Fleet knew that the torpedoes were not in order. Those who are guilty must be punished.\\" Navy officials in Vidyayevo later confirmed to The Times and to The St. Petersburg Times that Tylik was given a sedative. \\"We've been giving sedatives to relatives since this began, and it is not such a big deal as you make it out to be in the West,\\" said an officer who would not identify himself. \\"We are simply protecting the relatives from undue pain ‚Äì it was for her own protection.\\"\\"What Will Putin Learn From Media Circus?\\" Journalist Andrey Kolesnikov, who had been present at Putin's meeting with the families, described his experience in a 2015 documentary titled President. He said when he watched Putin talk to the families, he had never felt such an intense atmosphere of pain and anger in his entire life. =Putin blames media= In response to the avalanche of criticism, Minister of Defence Sergeyev and senior commanders of the Navy and the Northern Fleet offered Putin their resignations, but he refused to accept them. Putin lashed back at the press, who had been severely critical of his personal response and the entire government's handling of a national tragedy. During the meeting with the crew's relatives, he loudly blamed the oligarchs, who owned most of the country's non-government media, for the poor state of Russia's military. Putin told the family members, \\"There are people in television today who ... over the last 10 years destroyed the very army and fleet where people are dying now ... They stole money, they bought the media, and they're manipulating public opinion.\\" When relatives asked why the government had waited so long before accepting foreign assistance, Putin said the media had lied. He shouted to the assembled families, \\"They're lying. They're lying. They're lying.\\" Putin threatened to punish the media owners and counter their influence through alternative \\"honest and objective\\" media. He scornfully derided their ownership of property abroad. \\"They'd better sell their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain. Then they might have to explain why all this property is registered in false names under front law-firms. Perhaps we would ask them where they got the money.\\" In a speech to the Russian people the day after his meeting with the families, Putin continued his furious attack on the Russian media, accusing them of lying and discrediting the country. He said they were trying to \\"exploit this misfortune ... to gain political capital.\\" =Family compensation announced= On the same day as Putin's broadcast, Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko, head of a special commission, announced that the families of the Kursk sailors would receive not only 10 years' salary, but free housing in the Russian city of their choice, free college education for their children, and free counselling. With the addition of other donations received from across the world, the families received about US$35,000 in payments. Official inquiry results On 26 July 2002, almost two years later, the government commission and Russia's Prosecutor General, Vladimir Ustinov, announced that the hydrogen peroxide fuel in the dummy torpedo inside the fourth torpedo launcher set off the initial explosion that sank Kursk. =Secret report= Ustinov released a 133-volume top-secret report in August 2002, two years after the disaster. The government published a four-page summary in Rossiyskaya Gazeta that revealed \\"stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment\\", and \\"negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement\\". The report said the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed. =Initial blast damage= The bulkhead between the first and second compartment was traversed by a circular air conditioning duct. The bulkhead should have arrested the blast wave, but in keeping with common Russian submarine practice, the pressurised valve in the ventilation system that traversed the bulkhead was left open to minimise the change in pressure during a weapon's launch. The initial blast set off a fire that was later estimated to have burned at . The government report concluded that the initial explosion and fire in the torpedo room compartment immediately killed all seven crew members within. The open valve in the ventilation system allowed the huge blast wave and possibly the fire and toxic smoke to enter the second and perhaps the third and fourth compartments as well. Although the sub was at periscope depth with her radio antennas extended, no one in the command post was able to send a distress signal or press a single button that would initiate an emergency ballast tank blow and bring the submarine to the surface. All 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the blast wave and likely killed. =Secondary explosion= Two minutes and 14 seconds after the first explosion in the torpedo compartment, the fire set off a second explosion of 5‚Äì7 combat-ready torpedo warheads. Acoustic data from Pyotr Velikiy was later analysed and found to indicate an explosion of about 7 torpedo warheads in rapid succession. A single Type 65 \\"Kit\\" torpedo carries a large warhead. While the sub was submerged, 78 crew were normally assigned to the first four compartments and 49 to the rear five compartments. Although Kursk was designed to withstand external pressure of depths of up to , the second internal explosion tore a hole in the boat's hull, opening the first through fourth compartments to the sea. Water poured in at per second. The explosion collapsed the first three compartments and all of the decks. In addition to the crew in those compartments, there were five officers from 7th SSGN Division Headquarters and two design engineers on board to observe the performance of a new battery in the USET-80 torpedo, set to be launched second. Anyone who remained alive in those compartments was killed by the second explosion. =Practice torpedo blamed= The government report confirmed that Kursk had been sunk by a torpedo explosion caused when high- test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide, leaked from cracks in the torpedo's casing. HTP is normally stable until it comes in contact with a catalyst. It then expands 5,000 times in volume extremely rapidly, acting as an oxidiser, generating large volumes of steam and oxygen. Ordinarily, the oxygen combines with kerosene fuel in the torpedo engine to propel the missile at higher speed and greater range than conventional torpedoes. Investigators concluded that the leaking HTP had catalytically decomposed when it came in contact with copper commonly found in the bronze and brass used to manufacture Kursks torpedo tubes. The resulting overpressure ruptured the torpedo's kerosene fuel tank and caused an explosion that was registered as a weak seismic event on detectors hundreds of kilometres away. Once HTP begins oxidising, it is impossible to stop until the fuel is exhausted. Analysis revealed that when the of concentrated high-test peroxide and of kerosene exploded, the internal torpedo tube cover and the external tube door were blown off, opening the torpedo room to the sea. Salvage crews located a piece of the number four torpedo hatch on the seabed behind the main wreckage. Its position, distance, and direction relative to the rest of the submarine indicated that it was deposited there as a result of the first explosion in that tube. The fuel in the torpedoes carried by Kursk was inexpensive and very powerful. Torpedoes using HTP had been in use since the 1950s, but other navies stopped using them because of the danger inherent in their design. sank in 1955, killing 13 sailors, when an experimental torpedo containing HTP exploded as it was being loaded. According to an article that briefly appeared on Thursday 17 August 2000 on the website of the official newspaper of the Russian Defence Ministry, Krasnaya Zvezda, Kursk had been refitted in 1998‚Äîfour years after it was commissioned‚Äîto carry torpedoes fuelled using the cheap HTP. The article reported that some specialists in the Russian Navy opposed use of the HTP-fuelled torpedoes because they were volatile and dangerous. The story did not appear in the print edition on Friday 18 August. Instead, the article was replaced with another that speculated the submarine had collided with an \\"unidentified object\\". The change was likely due to political pressure. Vice-premier Ilya Klebanov, chair of the government commission investigating the accident, had a vested interest in suggesting the disaster had been caused by a collision with a NATO vessel. As head of the defence industries, over the objections of some officers, he had promoted use of the liquid-fuelled torpedoes over safer, more-expensive silver-zinc battery-powered torpedoes. =Faulty weld identified= The government's final report found that the officers who had issued the order approving use of the HTP torpedoes did not have the authority to issue that order. The dummy torpedo was ten years old and some of its parts had exceeded their service life. Several sources said that one of the practice torpedoes had been dropped during transport, possibly leading to a crack in the casing, but that the weapon was put aboard the submarine anyway. The crane that would normally have been used to load the missiles was, as usual, out of order, and another had to be brought in, delaying the loading process. This also made the possibility of removing a damaged torpedo more difficult. Personnel who had loaded the practice torpedoes the day before the exercise noticed that the rubber seals were leaking fuel and notified junior officers of the issue, but they took no action because the exercise was so important to the Russian Navy. Even though the leaks on the dummy torpedoes had been detected, the rubber seals were not inspected before the exercise. The crew was also supposed to follow a very strict procedure while preparing the practice HTP torpedo for firing. Maintenance records revealed that the 65‚Äì76 \\"Kit\\" practice torpedo carried by Kursk came from a batch of ten manufactured in 1990, six of which were rejected due to faulty welding. An investigation revealed that because the torpedoes were not intended to carry warheads, the welds had not been inspected as carefully as welds on torpedoes carrying warheads. When salvage crews finally recovered the remains of the torpedo and the launch tube, analysis determined that both bore signs of distortion and heat damage that were consistent with an explosion near the middle of the torpedo, very close to an essential welded joint. The official conclusion of the commission was that a faulty weld had led to the explosion. =Escape capsule inaccessible= In an emergency, personnel in the rear compartments were to move forward to the third compartment along with those in the forward compartments and enter a detachable rescue capsule in the sail (or conning tower), which was capable of evacuating the entire crew. Alternatively, there was also an escape trunk in the first compartment, but the explosion and fire rendered use of it impossible. The rescue capsule in the third compartment was inaccessible, even if it was still usable. =Shutdown of nuclear reactors= The fifth compartment that contained the boat's two nuclear reactors was built to withstand larger forces than other interior bulkheads. Like the exterior hull, these bulkheads were designed to withstand pressure up to depths of . The reactors were additionally encased in of steel and resiliently mounted to absorb shocks in excess of 50g. The bulkheads of the fifth compartment withstood both explosions, allowing the two reactors to shut down automatically and prevent a nuclear meltdown and widespread contamination of the sea. = Automated recordings disabled = The fifth compartment contained the nuclear reactors and equipment that automatically recorded the operating activity of the boat. Twenty-two recordings were analysed by specialists from the St. Petersburg Center of Speech Technologies. They discovered that the system had been turned off the day of the accident in violation of procedure. =Rescue buoy disabled= Kursk was equipped with an emergency rescue buoy on top of compartment seven that was designed to automatically deploy when it detected any of a variety of emergency conditions like a fire or a rapid pressure change. It was intended to float to the surface and send a signal that would help rescuers locate the stricken vessel. Some reports said that the buoy had repeatedly malfunctioned and had been welded in place. In fact, investigators learned that Kursk had been deployed to the Mediterranean during the summer of 1999 to monitor the U.S. fleet responding to the Kosovo War. Russian navy officers feared that the buoy might accidentally deploy, revealing the submarine's position to the U.S. fleet. They ordered the buoy to be disabled and it was still inoperative when the sub sank. =No charges filed= Despite the many lapses in procedures and equipment, Ustinov said no charges would be filed because the disaster was caused by a technical malfunction and blame could not be placed on specific individuals. He said that all of the sailors had died within eight hours and none of them could have been rescued in the time available. At a news conference announcing the end of the official inquiry, he absolved the torpedo's manufacturer of any fault. \\"Those who designed the torpedo couldn't foresee the possibility of its explosion.\\" He also said there was no evidence that the torpedo had been damaged when it was loaded onto Kursk. When Ustinov closed the criminal case without filing charges, family members were angry. Retired Russian navy Captain Vladimir Mityayev lost a son on Kursk. He said, \\"To me, this is a clear case of negligence.\\" In the end, no one was blamed for the disaster and no one was held responsible. Alternative explanations While the official government commission blamed the explosion on a faulty weld in the practice torpedo, Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. The internal tube door was designed to be three times as strong as the external torpedo door, so that any explosion inside the tube would be directed out into the sea. Salvage crews found the internal tube hatch cover embedded in the bulkhead separating the first and second compartments, from the tube. This led investigators to conclude that it was likely that the internal door was not fully closed when the explosion occurred. It was known that the electrical connectors between the torpedoes and the internal tube door were unreliable and often required the torpedo crews to open and re-close the door to clean the connection before an electrical contact could be established. Kursks crew had not fired a torpedo for three years, and that torpedo was a much simpler battery-powered type. The crew had to complete specific maintenance steps on a regular basis and before firing a torpedo. This included cleaning the torpedo tube of lubricants, metal shavings, and dust that accumulate during long periods of inactivity. After the accident, investigators recovered a partially burned copy of the safety instructions for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and failed to include essential steps for testing an air valve. The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected the Kursks crew's qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes. Kursks crew had no prior experience with and had not been trained in handling or firing HTP- powered torpedoes. Ryazantsev believed that due to their inexperience and lack of training, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, and because Kursks crew followed faulty instructions when loading the practice torpedo, they set off a chain of events that led to the explosion. Ryazantsev asserted that signatures on the records documenting that the sailors had been trained in handling and firing HTP torpedoes had been faked. He stated that the warhead fuses on combat torpedoes 1, 3, 5, and 6 were set off when the first compartment collapsed after striking the sea bottom. =Accusations of cover- up= The Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid published a report in June 2001 that senior officers in the Russian Navy had engaged in an elaborate deception to cover the actual cause of the disaster. This referred to statements that the boat's captain, Gennady Lyachin, had sent a message to headquarters immediately prior to the explosion, \\"We have a malfunctioning torpedo. Request permission to fire it,\\" though it is unlikely that, as captain of the vessel, he would have needed to request permission under such circumstances. The Russian Navy was later criticised as misrepresenting facts and misleading the public. The navy feared that if it was revealed that the submarine blew up because of crew incompetence, Russia's status as a great power would be in doubt. Their response was compared to the Soviet style of cover up and stonewalling like that during the Chernobyl disaster. Minister of Defence Sergeyev said in interviews on 21 March 2000, that he had never refused any foreign help. The Guardian wrote in a 2002 review of two books, Kursk, Russia's Lost Pride and A Time to Die: The Kursk Disaster: =Conspiracy theories= While most experts agreed that a torpedo had exploded, they differed on what caused the explosion. Many Russians did not believe that Kursk could be so easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of . Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk. =Manufacturer disagrees on cause= The director of the that designed the torpedo, Stanislav Proshkin, challenged the conclusion of the government's official report. He said the weapon could have exploded only after an external event like a fire. He said that the torpedoes are routinely tested during manufacturing and are dropped from a height of without causing damage that could lead to an explosion. He also said Kursk was designed with two autonomous, independent control systems that would have detected a rise in temperature while the torpedo was stored on the racks. The sub was equipped with a special drain system that could rapidly drain hydrogen peroxide fuel from a torpedo into the sea. If a temperature rise was detected in the torpedo tube, the torpedo would have automatically been ejected into the sea. In addition, any fire in the torpedo compartment would have triggered a powerful fire-extinguishing system that would have dumped \\"tons of water\\" on the fire.  Salvage operation  The Russian government committed to raising the wreck and recovering the crew's remains in a US$65M salvage operation. They contracted with the Dutch marine salvage companies Smit International and Mammoet to raise Kursk from the sea floor. It became the largest salvage operation of its type ever accomplished. The salvage operation was extremely dangerous because of the risk of radiation from the reactor. Only seven of the submarine's 24 torpedoes were accounted for. = Bow detached = Salvage divers from Halliburton first detached the bow from the rest of the vessel because it might have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a high-strength tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled back and forth over the bow between the anchors. It took ten days to detach the bow. After the bow was cut free, the salvage crews raised several smaller pieces of wreckage. This included a piece of a torpedo tube weighing about a ton which was analysed to try to learn if the explosion occurred inside or outside the tube. They salvaged a high-pressure compressed air cylinder weighing about half a ton, to learn more about the nature of the explosion. They also raised a part of the cylindrical section of the hard frame and part of the left forward spherical partition, to determine the intensity and temperature of the fire in the forward compartment. Finally, they brought up a fragment of the sonar system dome. = Hull raised = Giant 4 in background Mammoet converted the , long, Giant 4 semi-submersible deck barge to carry the sub. The ship was designed to carry huge loads on its deck, but Kursk would ride beneath the ship. Giant 4 had to be completely modified to retrieve and carry the sub underneath. To raise the remainder of the boat, the salvage team planned an extremely complex operation that required them to design and build custom lifting equipment and employ new technologies. They wrote custom software that would automatically compensate for the effects of wave motion due to the rough Barents Sea, which could sever the cables suspending the sub beneath the barge. Divers cut a large hole in the barge's hull to allow room for the submarine's sail. Workers fitted the hull of Giant 4 with large saddles shaped to fit Kursks outer hull. They cut holes through the barge to allow 26 hoisting cables to pass through. The team manufactured 26 giant cable reels to hold the more than of cable to be used to raise the boat. The giant cable reels fed 26 huge hydraulic strand jacks, each mounted on a computer-controlled, pressurised pneumatic heave compensator powered by nitrogen gas that automatically adjusted for sea waves. Giant 4 was held in position over the submarine by an eight-point mooring system from four twin-drum winches on the main deck. Mayo, a diving platform, was equipped with dive chambers to accommodate the dive teams. They worked in six-hour shifts, and when they were not in the water, the divers remained in the saturation chambers for the entire 28 days the operation took. The divers used hydraulic abrasive water jets to cut 26 holes through both the outer and inner hulls. The salvage divers mounted custom guidance rings around the holes in the sub and lowered guide cables to each through the holes in Giant 4. The team then used the four guide cables to lower a custom-made giant gripper, similar to a toggle bolt, which were custom designed to fit each hole, and the divers manoeuvred them through the guidance ring. The crew lowered 26 groups of hoisting cables, each capable of lifting 900 tons, to the submarine and attached them to the grippers. The strand jacks lifted the 26 hoisting cables and slowly raised Kursk until it was beneath Giant 4. On 8 October 2001, fourteen months after the disaster, and only five months after the contract had been awarded to them, the salvage team raised the remainder of the ship in a 15-hour operation. Once the sub was raised and joined to the barge, it was carried back under the barge to the Russian Navy's Roslyakovo Shipyard in Murmansk. Once there, two giant, custom-manufactured pontoons were floated under Giant 4 to lift the barge to allow it to enter a floating dry dock with Kursk attached underneath. Once in the dry dock, the pontoons were pumped full of more air, lifting Giant 4 and allowing crews to remove the lifting cables and detach Kursk. = Bow destroyed on sea floor = The Russians initially intended to raise the bow from the sea floor‚Äîpossibly containing undetonated torpedoes‚Äîbut then decided it was too risky. Some analysts theorised the Russians may also have wanted to prevent foreign countries from accessing the debris which had been classified as state secrets. They decided to destroy what was left of the bow where it lay and blew up the remnants in September 2002. =Crew in ninth compartment= There were 24 men assigned to compartments six through nine towards the rear of the boat. Of that number, 23 survived the two blasts and gathered in the small ninth compartment, which had an escape hatch. Captain-lieutenant Dmitri Kolesnikov, head of the turbine unit in the seventh department, and one of three surviving officers of that rank, apparently took charge. Emergency lighting was normally powered by batteries located in the first compartment, but these had been destroyed in the explosion. But the ninth compartment contained a number of independent emergency lights, which apparently worked. Kolesnikov wrote two notes, parts of which were released by Vice Admiral Motsak to the media for the first time on 27 October 2000. The first, written at 13:15, 1 hour and 45 minutes after the second explosion, contained a private note to his family and, on the reverse, information on their situation and the names of those in the ninth compartment. The handwriting appears normal, indicating the sailors still had some light. Kolesnikov wrote the second note at 15:15. His writing was extremely difficult to read. The newspaper Izvestia reported on 26 February 2001 that another note, written by Lt. Cmdr. Rashid Aryapov, had been recovered during the initial rescue operation. Aryapov held a senior position in the sixth compartment. The note was written on the page of a detective novel and wrapped in plastic. It was found in a pocket of his clothing after his body was recovered. Izvestia quoted unidentified naval officers who claimed that Aryapov wrote that the explosion was caused by \\"faults in the torpedo compartment, namely, the explosion of a torpedo on which the Kursk had to carry out tests\\". Izvestia also stated that Aryapov wrote that as a result of the explosions the submarine was tossed violently about, and many crew members were injured by equipment that tore loose as a result. To the Russian public, it appeared that the Russian Navy was covering up its inability to rescue the trapped sailors. =Escape hatch unused= Analysis of the wreck could not determine whether the escape hatch was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the escape hatch even if it were operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore and in the middle of a large naval exercise. The sailors had every reason to believe that rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been very difficult for them. When the nuclear reactors automatically shut down, the air purification system would have shut down, emergency power would be limited, and the crew would soon have been in complete darkness and experienced falling temperatures. =Death of survivors= There was considerable debate over how long the sailors in the ninth compartment had survived. Russian military officers initially gave conflicting accounts, that survivors could have lived up to a week within the sub, but those that died would have been killed very quickly. The Dutch recovery team reported that they thought the men in the least affected ninth compartment might have survived for two to three hours. But the level of carbon dioxide in the compartment exceeded that which people can produce in a closed space. Divers found ash and dust inside the compartment when they first opened that hatch, evidence of a fire. But this fire was separate from that caused by the exploding torpedo. Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov, evidently the senior officer in the compartment, wrote a final note at 15:15 in the dark, giving evidence that he was alive at least four hours after the explosion. Other notes recovered later show that some sailors in the ninth compartment were alive at least 6 hours and 17 minutes after the boat sank. Vice Admiral Vladislav Ilyin, first deputy chief of the Russian Navy's staff and head of the Kursk Naval Incident Cell, concluded that the survivors had lived up to three days. In any event, the Russian rescue teams were poorly equipped and badly organised, while foreign teams and equipment were far away and not given permission to assist. It is unlikely that any rescue by either Russian or foreign specialists could have arrived and reached the sub in time to rescue any survivors.Russia's Kursk Disaster: Reactions and Implications Central Intelligence Agency, Office of Russian and European Analysis, Office of Transnational Issues, 7 December 2000 = Forensic examination = While waiting for the boat to be brought to shore, a team of military doctors set up a temporary forensic laboratory at the military hospital in Severomorsk. After Giant 4 was floated out of the drydock, water was drained from the drydock, exposing the Kursk's hull. Salvage teams cut into the compartments to drain water from the interior. Ordnance teams removed the Granit cruise missiles and Stallion anti-ship missiles from outside the hull. On 23 October, two investigators and two navy commanders were the first to enter the hull. The next day, 24 October, eight teams of investigators and operational experts began analysing the debris found inside the boat and recovering and identifying remains of the crew. Working from a database of personal identification details, including the crew members' features, dental x-rays, birth marks, and tattoos, the doctors examined the bodies as they were brought to the laboratory. Salvage team members found a large number of potassium superoxide chemical cartridges, used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen to enable survival, in the ninth compartment. Autopsies of the crew recovered from the ninth compartment showed that three men suffered from thermal and chemical burns. Researchers concluded Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov and two others had attempted to recharge the oxygen generation system when they accidentally dropped one of the chemical superoxide cartridges into the sea water slowly filling the compartment. When the cartridge came in contact with the oily sea water, it triggered a chemical explosion and flash fire. Kolesnikov's abdomen was burned by acid, exposing the internal organs, and the flesh on his head and neck were removed by the chemical explosion. The investigation showed that some men temporarily survived this fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. But the flash fire consumed all remaining oxygen, so that the men still alive after the flash explosion quickly died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Water continued to seep into the compartment, and by the time rescue divers opened the compartment, they found only a small air pocket containing just 7% oxygen. Bodies recovered from the ninth compartment were relatively easy to identify. Those recovered from the third, fourth, and fifth compartments were badly damaged by the explosion. Forensic examination of two of the reactor control room casualties found in compartment four showed extensive skeletal injuries which indicated that they had sustained an explosive force of over 50g. These shocks would have immediately incapacitated or killed the operators. One sailor's body was found embedded in the ceiling of the second compartment. Three crewmen's bodies were completely destroyed by the blast and fire and nothing of their remains could be identified or recovered. Aftermath =Public relations= The sinking of the ship, the pride of their submarine fleet, was a devastating blow to the Russian military. The Kursks participation in the exercise had been intended to demonstrate Russia's place as an important player on the international stage, but the country's inept handling of the crisis instead exposed its weak political decision-making ability and the decline of its military. A year later Putin commented on his response, \\"I probably should have returned to Moscow, but nothing would have changed. I had the same level of communication both in Sochi and in Moscow, but from a PR point of view I could have demonstrated some special eagerness to return.\\" =Navy actions= Once the human remains had been removed and the hull had been thoroughly investigated, the remainder of the ship was transported to Sayda Bay on the northern Kayla Peninsula. The two nuclear reactors were defuelled and the ship was cut up for scrap. Finally recognising the hazard of the HTP-fuelled torpedoes, the Russian Navy ordered all of them to be removed from service. Officers moved Putin accepted the resignation of Igor Sergeyev from his position as Minister of Defence on 28 March 2001 and made him his assistant on strategic stability. He replaced him with Sergei Ivanov, who had previously been secretary of the Security Council of Russia. The position of Minister of Defence had always been filled by a professional member of the military. Ivanov had retired from the military in 2000, so his appointment as Minister of Defence while a civilian shocked the Russian military. On 1 December 2001, Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov presented a preliminary report to Putin. Ustinov wrote that the entire exercise had been \\"poorly organized\\" and that the probe had revealed \\"serious violations by both Northern Fleet chiefs and the Kursk crew.\\" Shortly afterward, Putin transferred the Northern Fleet commander, Vyacheslav Popov, and his chief of staff, Admiral Mikhail Motsak. As is common in such circumstances, both soon obtained jobs elsewhere in the government. Popov became a representative for the Murmansk region in the Federation Council, and Motsak became deputy presidential envoy for the North-Western Federal District. Popov and Motsak had championed the story that the accident had been caused by a collision with a NATO submarine. When Putin dismissed them, he made a point of repudiating the collision theory. In another example of a lateral transfer, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov had been an outspoken advocate of the theory that the Kursk had collided with a foreign submarine. He had also been in charge of the rescue operation and follow-up inquiry. In February 2002, Putin removed him from his position as Deputy Prime Minister and made him Minister of Industry, Science, and Technology. Putin dismissed the Northern Fleet's submarine commander, Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev, and in total removed 12 high-ranking officers in charge of the Northern Fleet. Paradoxically, he said their dismissal had nothing to do with the Kursk disaster, but that they had been responsible for \\"serious flaws in the organizations of the service.\\" However, all 12 had been involved with the exercise, the rescue operations, or the submarine itself. All were transferred to equal positions elsewhere in the government or in the business sector. International co-operation As a result of the disaster, Russia began participating in NATO search and rescue exercises in 2011. It was the first time a Russian submarine had taken part in a NATO-led exercise. The Russian Navy also increased the number of deep-sea divers trained each year from 18‚Äì20 to 40‚Äì45. =Awards to those killed= President Putin signed a decree awarding the Order of Courage to the entire crew, and the title Hero of the Russian Federation to the submarine's captain, Gennady Lyachin. =Memorials= The sail of Kursk was rescued from a scrapyard and turned into a memorial at the Church of the Saviour on Waters in Murmansk. It is dedicated to the men who died aboard the sub: \\"To the submariners, who died in peacetime\\". Outside the port city of Severodvinsk where the submarine was built, a large granite slab was erected on the sand dunes. It is engraved, \\"This sorrowful stone is set in memory of the crew of the nuclear submarine Kursk, who tragically died on 12 August 2000, while on military duty.\\" Other memorials were built in Moscow, Sevastopol, Nizhny Novgorod, and Severomorsk. A memorial was erected in Serafimovskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg, where 32 of the sailors were buried. The city of Kursk, for which the vessel was named, erected a memorial made from fragments of its hull. On 17 March 2009, journalist Tatyana Abramova from the newspaper Murmanskiy Vestnik found Kursks sail in the yard of a scrap metal dealer. It had been left there after several years of negotiations had failed to raise the estimated ‚Ç¨22,000 for a memorial. The discovery sparked an outcry among citizens in Murmansk and they demanded it be turned into a memorial to the men who died. After considerable difficulty, the memorial was finally completed and dedicated on Sunday, 26 July 2009, Russia's Navy Day. It was placed on the observation deck of the Church of the Saviour on Water in Murmansk, the submarine's home port and location of the Vidyayevo naval base. It is among a memorial to sailors who perished during peacetime. It lists the names of the crew members. On 31 July 2012, divers representing the relatives of Kursks crew and the Northern Fleet command placed an Orthodox cross on the floor of the Barents Sea at the site of the disaster.

Carnitine is an important amino acid for fatty acid metabolism.Activation and Transportation of Fatty Acids for Metabolism via Carnitine Shuttle When carnitine cannot be transported into tissues, fatty acid oxidation is impaired, leading to a variety of symptoms such as chronic muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction. The specific transporter involved with SPCD is OCTN2, coded for by the SLC22A5 gene located on chromosome 5. SPCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutated alleles coming from both parents. Acute episodes due to SPCD are often preceded by metabolic stress such as extended fasting, infections or vomiting. Cardiomyopathy can develop in the absence of an acute episode, and can result in death. SPCD leads to increased carnitine excretion in the urine and low levels in plasma. In most locations with expanded newborn screening, SPCD can be identified and treated shortly after birth. Treatment with high doses of carnitine supplementation is effective, but needs to be rigorously maintained for life. SPCD is more common in the Faroe Islands than in other countries; at least one out of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes has the illness,Hmr.fo - Faroe Islands Ministry of Health - Information om CTD (Carnitin Transporter Defekt) while the numbers for other countries are one in every 100,000. Around 100 persons in the islands have been diagnosed, around one third of the whole population of 48,000 people have been screened for SPCD. Several young Faroese people and children have died a sudden death with cardiac arrest because of SPCD. Scientists believe that around 10% of the Faroese population are carriers of variants which cause SPCD.Dr.dk - Livsfarlig sygdom angriber f√¶ringe - By Tine Maria Borres√∏, 17 May 2010 These people are not ill, but may have a lower amount of carnitine in their blood than non-carriers. Signs and symptoms The presentation of patient with SPCD can be incredibly varied, from asymptomatic to lethal cardiac manifestations. Early cases were reported with liver dysfunction, muscular findings (weakness and underdevelopment), hypoketotic hypoglycemia, cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy and marked carnitine deficiency in plasma and tissues, combined with increased excretion in urine. Patients who present clinically with SPCD fall into two categories, a metabolic presentation with hypoglycemia and a cardiac presentation characterized by cardiomyopathy. Muscle weakness can be found with either presentation. In countries with expanded newborn screening, SPCD can be identified shortly after birth. Affected infants show low levels of free carnitine and all other acylcarnitine species by tandem mass spectrometry. Not all infants with low free carnitine are affected with SPCD. Some may have carnitine deficiency secondary to another metabolic condition or due to maternal carnitine deficiency. Proper follow-up of newborn screening results for low free carnitine includes studies of the mother to determine whether her carnitine deficiency is due to SPCD or secondary to a metabolic disease or diet. Maternal cases of SPCD have been identified at a higher than expected rate, often in women who are asymptomatic. Some mothers have also been identified through newborn screening with cardiomyopathy that had not been previously diagnosed. The identification and treatment of these asymptomatic individuals is still developing, as it is not clear whether they require the same levels of intervention as patients identified with SPCD early in life based on clinical presentation. Genetics SPCD is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning a mutated allele must be inherited from each parent for an individual to be affected. The gene responsible for the OCTN2 carnitine transporter is SLC22A5, located at 5q31.1-32. SLC22A5 is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. The transporter, OCTN2, is located in the apical membrane of the renal tubular cells, where it plays a role in tubular reabsorption. The defective OCTN2 is unable to recapture carnitine prior to its excretion in urine, leading to the characteristic biochemical findings of massively increased urine carnitine levels and significantly decreased plasma carnitine levels. Decreased levels of plasma carnitine inhibit fatty acid oxidation during times of excessive energy demand. Carnitine is needed to transport long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they can be broken down to produce acetyl-CoA. Individuals with SPCD cannot produce ketone bodies as energy due to the interruption of fatty acid oxidation. Although SPCD is an autosomal recessive condition, heterozygotes have been shown to be at an increased risk for developing benign cardiomyopathy compared to wild type individuals. Diagnosis  The first suspicion of SPCD in a patient with a non-specific presentation is an extremely low plasma carnitine level. When combined with an increased concentration of carnitine in urine, the suspicion of SPCD can often be confirmed by either molecular testing or functional studies assessing the uptake of carnitine in cultured fibroblasts. Treatment Identification of patients presymptomatically via newborn screening has allowed early intervention and treatment. Treatment for SPCD involves high dose carnitine supplementation, which must be continued for life. Individuals who are identified and treated at birth have very good outcomes, including the prevention of cardiomyopathy. Mothers who are identified after a positive newborn screen but are otherwise asymptomatic are typically offered carnitine supplementation as well. The long-term outcomes for asymptomatic adults with SPCD is not known, but the discovery of mothers with undiagnosed cardiomyopathy and SPCD has raised the possibility that identification and treatment may prevent adult-onset manifestations. Incidence The addition of SPCD to newborn screening panels has offered insight into the incidence of the disorder around the world. In Taiwan, the incidence of SPCD in newborns was estimated to be approximately 1:67,000, while maternal cases were identified at a higher frequency of approximately 1:33,000. The increased incidence of SPCD in mothers compared to newborns is not completely understood. Estimates of SPCD in Japan have shown a similar incidence of 1:40,000. Worldwide, SPCD has the highest incidence in the relatively genetically isolated Faroe Islands, where an extensive screening program was instituted after the sudden death of two teenagers. The incidence in the Faroe Islands is approximately 1:200. History Carnitine deficiency has been extensively studied, although most commonly as a secondary finding to other metabolic conditions. The first case of SPCD was reported in the 1980s, in a child with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia that resolved after treatment with carnitine supplementation. Later cases were reported with cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. Newborn screening expanded the potential phenotypes associated with SPCD, to include otherwise asymptomatic adults.

It stars Anthony Perkins, who also directs the film, reprising the role of Norman Bates. It co-stars Diana Scarwid, Jeff Fahey, and Roberta Maxwell. The screenplay is written by Charles Edward Pogue. The original electronic music score is composed and performed by Carter Burwell in one of his earliest projects. Psycho III is unrelated to Robert Bloch's third Psycho novel, Psycho House, which was released in 1990. The film takes place one month after the events of Psycho II where Norman Bates is still running the Bates Motel with the corpse of Emma Spool still sitting up in the house. A suicidal nun, with whom Norman falls in love, comes to the motel along with a drifter named Duane Duke. A reporter also tries to solve the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Spool as someone begins another murder spree. Released on July 2, 1986, Psycho III grossed $14.4 million at the U.S. box office on an $8.4 million budget, becoming a financial failure and the lowest-grossing film in the series, and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a television sequel and prequel, Psycho IV: The Beginning. Plot In 1982, Norman Bates works at the Bates Motel and lives with the preserved corpse of Emma Spool, a waitress who told him she was his real mother. When Spool remains missing after a month, Norman's ex-boss, Ralph Statler, and local law enforcement grow concerned. Duane Duke, a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the motel. Tracy Venable, a journalist from Los Angeles, is working on an article about serial killers being released from custody. Believing that Norman is killing again, Tracy appears at the diner where he works and attempts to talk with him. Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. Maureen resembles his former victim, Marion Crane. Seeing the initials \\"M.C.\\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner. \\"Mother\\" enters Maureen's bathroom that night, intending to kill her, only to find that she has cut her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \\"Mother\\" holding a knife for the Virgin Mary holding a crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. That night, Duane picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than a fling, Duane rejects her. Red tries calling a cab, but \\"Mother\\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, planning to watch a football game. Tracy searches Spool's apartment, discovering the motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly. Patsy Boyle, the motel's only sober guest, is murdered by \\"Mother\\". Norman finds her body and buries her in the motel's ice chest. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duane extorts Norman, threatening to turn him into the police for murder unless he is given a large sum of money. In an ensuing fight, Norman beats Duane with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives his car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies inside. Duane regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duane drowns. Tracy talks to Statler about Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler purchased it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Spool was also institutionalized for murder. Maureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \\"Mother\\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \\"Mother\\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \\"Mother\\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee. Tracy tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma. Spool killed Norman's father and kidnapped Norman when he was a child, believing he was the child \\"she should have had with him\\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \\"Mother\\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \\"Mother\\" instead, dismembering Spool's corpse. Sheriff Hunt takes Norman to his squad car. Hunt informs Norman that they may never release him from the institution again, to which Norman replies: \\"But I'll be free...I'll finally be free.\\" In the back of the squad car, Norman caresses the severed hand of Emma Spool. Cast Music Carter Burwell was approached by Perkins to compose the score to the film, since Perkins had enjoyed Burwell's work on Blood Simple. Perkins stated that he wanted to take the score in a more contemporary direction than Jerry Goldsmith had for his more traditional score for Psycho II. Burwell flew to Los Angeles and recorded the score largely on a Synclavier electronic music station, augmented by women's and boys' choirs as well as percussion by Steve Forman. After Universal suggested the film contain some pop songs so that the film could be marketable to the MTV generation, Burwell composed and performed songs with colleagues Stanton Miranda and Steve Bray. After Universal claimed the songs weren't sufficiently bankable, Burwell attempted to create a song with Oingo Boingo frontman and then burgeoning film composer Danny Elfman, using sampled strings from Bernard Herrmann's score to the original Psycho. This idea was also rejected. Universal finally agreed to let Burwell take a motif from the score he'd composed and develop it into an instrumental electronic pop song. The song, \\"Scream of Love\\"‚Äîco-written by jazz saxophonist David Sanborn‚Äîwas released as a 7\\" single and a series of dance remixes were commissioned from Arthur Baker and featured on the 12\\" version. MCA also commissioned a music video for the song featuring Burwell, Perkins and a \\"Hitchcockian woman.\\" Perkins introduced the video on MTV as a guest VJ on July 2, 1986. The rest of the songs composed by Burwell, Miranda and Bray were used as background music in the film, playing from car stereos and jukeboxes. Burwell's score was sampled by the hip hop group Insane Poetry on \\"Welcome to the Grim Side\\", the intro to their 1992 debut album Grim Reality, as well as on British musician Aim's 1999 electronica album, Cold Water Music. Release When the film opened on July 2, 1986, it earned $3.2 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $14.4 million at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the Psycho series. Critical response Reviews from critics were mixed. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote a generally positive review, calling Perkins a \\"very creditable director\\" and Pogue's screenplay \\"efficient,\\" concluding that \\"'Psycho III' expresses its appreciation of the Hitchcock legacy without seeming to rip it off.\\" Variety wrote that the film \\"has its moments‚Äîabout 20 minutes' worth‚Äîbut the rest is filler in which the filmmakers gamely but futilely try to breathe new life into a tired body.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times thought that the film was \\"better in most respects than 'II',\\" but \\"it fails any sequel's acid test. It feeds off the original without deepening it.\\" He added that \\"if the movie proves anything, it's that everyone should give Hitchcock a rest.\\"Wilmington, Michael (July 2, 1986). \\"'Psycho III' Still Getting Nourishment From Original\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 10. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post called it \\"a playful, artfully made horror movie\\" made \\"really fun\\" by \\"Perkins and Pogue's morbid humor, the way they've captured the Hitchcock spirit and made it their own.\\" Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that Perkins gave \\"an excellent performance\\" but \\"there isn't very much more to be said about Norman Bates.\\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were split on the film's effectiveness. On their television show At the Movies, Ebert gave the film a \\"thumbs up\\" positive appraisal, saying it was a \\"much better movie than part two,\\" and adding, \\"in his first directing effort, Perkins shows that he knows Norman better than anyone else.\\" Siskel, however, gave the film a \\"thumbs down\\" negative rating, reasoning that he was \\"turned off by some of the violence\\" and that the film \\"just sort of laid there.\\" As of December 2019, the film holds a 58% approval rating based on 19 reviews on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.2/10. Home media Psycho III has been released four times on DVD. The initial release came in 1999 when Universal Studios leased the film out to GoodTimes Home Video. The second release came in 2005 from Universal Studios itself. The third release came in 2007 as part of a triple feature package with Psycho II and Psycho IV: The Beginning.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1985 representing the riding of Scarborough Centre. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Bill Davis. Background Drea was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, and educated at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. He was hired by the Toronto Telegram in 1955, and was a long-time reporter and columnist at the paper. In 1961, he won the National Newspaper Award and the Heywood Broun Award for Crusading Journalism for his work as a labour reporter for his coverage of a strike by Italian-Canadian building trade workers. From 1963 to 1965, he worked as public relations director for the United Steel Workers of America in Sudbury, Ontario. A fervent anti-Communist, Drea played a leading role in the Steelworkers' unsuccessful campaign to raid and destroy the Communist Party influenced Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union which had dominated the mining industry in Sudbury. Drea's campaign was a failure, and he was fired. He returned to the Telegram in 1965 as the paper's Action Line columnist, serving as an early consumer advocate. He remained with the newspaper until shortly before its demise in 1971. He also served with Dale Goldhawk as an outspoken, open-line host at CHIC Radio in Brampton, Ontario and worked for CTV on the public affairs program W5. Politics Drea was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1971 provincial election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament for Scarborough Centre. He defeated incumbent New Democrat Margaret Renwick by 4,873 votes. Drea was re-elected with smaller pluralities in the 1975 and 1977 elections, and by a larger percentage in 1981. After serving for several years on the backbench, he was brought into the provincial cabinet of Bill Davis following the 1977 provincial election as Minister of Correctional Services. He initiated reforms in the province's system of jails, including the closure of the original Don Jail. On entering cabinet, Drea publicly revealed his battle with alcoholism, pledging to stop drinking in order to set an example for prisoners. In 1978, he was appointed Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations. After the 1981 provincial election, he became Minister of Community and Social Services, and is credited with improving the status of people with disabilities. In September 1983 he was hospitalized with circulation problems. He briefly gave up his cabinet position from September 29, 1983 to November 21, 1983. Citizenship and Culture minister Bruce McCaffrey was named to act in his place during this time. He served in cabinet until Bill Davis retired as Premier of Ontario in 1985. Drea supported Roy McMurtry's bid to succeed Davis as party leader, and voted for Larry Grossman on the second ballot following McMurtry's elimination. He supported Frank Miller over Grossman on the third and final ballot. Drea explained that he had planned to support Miller after McMurtry's elimination, and only went to Grossman for one ballot on McMurtry's recommendation. He was not re-appointed to Miller's cabinet and instead served as parliamentary assistant to the premier. Drea was disappointed at being dropped from cabinet and decided not to run in the 1985 election. He said, \\"I'm not wanted so, I won't be running.\\" He reflected on his time in politics. \\"I'm happy,\\" he said. \\"I've had 14 marvellous years with Mr. Davis ... the greatest living Canadian.\\" =Cabinet posts= Later life Drea was appointed to the Ontario Municipal Board by Miller in May 1985. His tenure there was short as Miller's successor, Liberal Premier David Peterson, appointed Drea as chairman of the Ontario Racing Commission four month later. Drea remained chairman until 1994 when Bob Rae's NDP government decided not to reappoint him. He would not speculate on the reason for dropping him from the position. \\"I don't know why they're doing it,\\" he shrugged. \\"It's like ball players. You get hired. You get fired.\\" During his tenure as chairman he introduced teletheatres for simulcasting races across the province and was responsible for saving racetrack operations in Windsor, Elmira and Sudbury. He died on January 15, 2003 from pneumonia.

Irish Forestry, Vol. 73 (2016). p.249Mills, David. A Dictionary of British Place-Names. Oxford University Press, 2011. p.38 locally also Ballisodare, is a town in County Sligo, Ireland. It is about 7 kilometres (4 miles) south of Sligo town. The town developed on an important crossing of the Owenmore River. History =Toponymy= The Ox Mountains () are located west of the town. The town itself is named after the falls on the Owenmore River. Ballysadare is in the barony of Leyny formerly the t√∫ath of Luighne Connacht, and the barony of Tirerril, formerly the t√∫ath of T√≠r Ollo√≠l. The Owenmore river forms the border between the baronies. Ballysadare also borders two other baronies in Co. Sligo, Carbury to the North and Tireragh to the West. Ballysadare is in the diocese of Achonry. Alternative names for the falls are Ess Mac Modairn (Falls of the son of Modairn) and Ess na n-√âan (The Falls of the Bird). There appear to be three variants of English version of the settlement name still in use, Ballysadare being on the road signs coming to dominate. The use of Ballisodare remains in evidence on the names of some local sport clubs and even on at least one Sligo County Council document in 2018. Ballysodare appears to been used for the railway station and there is evidence of its use on a map of 1887 and indexing of parish registers at the National Library of Ireland. =Early history= Ballysadare is a possible location for the town noted as Nagnata on Claudius Ptolemy's 2nd century CE co-ordinate map of the world. Ballysadare was anciently a major gathering place for all surrounding districts. St. Columba visited Ballysadare in 575 AD at which \\"Before the Saint (Columba) returned to Britain he founded one church in the district of Carbury, and proceeded from thence to a place called Easdara, where all the prelates of the neighbouring regions, and vast numbers of holy men and women had come to meet him ; and, to say nothing of the rest of the multitude, which was almost beyond counting, a great many distinguished saints of the race of Cumne are recorded to have been present.\\" This extract is from Colgans Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae. The O'Hara were the lords of L√∫ighne. =Saint F√©ich√≠n= St F√©ich√≠n was born in the townland of Billa in the parish of Ballysadare. He is said to have studied under St. Nath √ç of Achonry further to the south in the same territory. The word Bile means a sacred tree or grove. The townland is the location of the Leaba St. F√©ich√≠n or St. Feichins bed. The town developed near a church founded by St. F√©ich√≠n, some time before he died in 664 AD (O‚ÄôRorke 1878, 1-4).This monastic site is in Kilboglashy townland and the remains consist of a stone church known as the Great Temple of St. F√©ich√≠n (Teampal m√≥r F√©ich√≠n), with a later Romanesque style carved doorway, two small buildings and a graveyard. The O'Duillenain, were erenachs of Ballysadare. The Canons Regular of St. Augustine built a new priory a short distance to the west in Abbeytown Townland in the 13th century. Ballysadare was mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters 15 times between 1158 and 1602, in 1188, 1199, 1228, 1230, 1235, 1239, 1249, 1261, 1267, 1285, 1360, 1444, 1595 and 1602. In 1360, the Annals of the Four Masters note: A bridge of lime and stone was built by Cathal O‚ÄôConor across the river of Eas- dara. In 1588, all monastery lands around Ballysadare were seized by the Dublin Castle government on behalf of the Crown. =Mines= Ballysadare is the site of an ancient silver and lead mine, re-opened and worked in the 19th and 20th century. It is now the site of a quarry. =Recent history= Modern apartment development Ballysadare was the location of a Pollexfen Mills, since demolished. There is also a hydro electric power station in the vicinity. The area experienced rapid development during the 'Celtic Tiger' boom, with the population more than doubling in the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census (from 612 to 1,350 people). During this period several new housing estates were developed, several of which subsequently remained empty, creating phantom estates. The town was bypassed by the N4 Sligo-Collooney dual-carriageway, completed in January 1998. The N59 Ballina-Sligo road still winds through the town. Education It is home to St. Mary's College,a secondary school which serves the southern and western environs of County Sligo, including the surrounding areas of Collooney and Coolaney.

There are several old names for the strand, the most common being Tr√° E√≥chaille, Strand of the Yew Wood, or after Eochaille the wright. Tr√° Ruis Airgid, Strand of Red Silver, perhaps because of the silver and lead mine at Abbeytown near Ballysadare.

It lies on the N15 national route at its junction with the R279. It is only three kilometres away from Mullaghmore which is popular with surfers. Cliffoney has historical connections to Lord Palmerston, British Prime Minister and Father Michael O'Flanagan, Vice-President and later President of Sinn F√©in, who was known as the Republican Priest. Brigid MacGonigal, mother of Harry Clarke, was a native of Cliffoney. There are several megalithic monuments close to the village, including Creevykeel Court Tomb. There are also several ringforts and cashels in the area. Saint Brigit's well has a cross-slab, probably dating to the eight century, with a swastika carved in the top of the cross.  History  The oldest buildings in Cliffoney are the five megalithic tombs close to the village in the townlands of Creevykeel, Creevymore and Cartronplank. Creevykeel, considered one of the finest examples of its kind in Ireland, was excavated by the Harvard Archaeological Mission in 1935. A second monument close to Creevykeel was destroyed completely by 1890. The chamber and back-stone of Cartronplank court tomb still survives, located on a private farm. The other two monuments are overgrown and on private land. The Cliffoney megaliths were visited by many antiquarians and researchers, and were illustrated by William Wakeman in 1880. Creevykeel is in state care and is maintained by the Office of Public Works. The other sites are on private property. = Saint Bridget's well and cross = The modern statue and ancient cross-slab at Saint Bridget's well close to Cliffoney village.

Beside the well is an early Christian cross-slab known as the Cliffoney Cross, thought to date to the eighth century and contemporary with the many carved slabs on Inishmurray. The well was the site of an ancient cattle fair held annually on 1 February.

The lands around Cliffoney were granted to James Byrne after the Cromwellian conquests in the mid 1600s. After 1690 the lands were granted to Sir John Temple. The title Viscount Palmerston was created in 1723. The Palmerston family were absentee landlords, leaving the management of their estates to middlemen. The second Viscount \\"contributed generously to local charities in Romsey, but he had no feelings of obligation towards his Irish tenants, and never invested any money in his lands in Sligo.\\" Upon the sudden death of the second Viscount in 1802, the Cliffoney estates were inherited by his oldest son, Henry John Temple, better known as the third Viscount, Lord Palmerston. The young Lord Palmerston visited his Sligo estates, consisting of some 10,000 acres, for the first time in 1808. > He found a destitute tenantry renting small plots from middlemen, who set > the land to tenants in rundale, a system of communal occupation under which > an individual tenant might from time to time hold many tiny detached plots. > In the early nineteenth century huge tracts of Ahamlish were destroyed by > shifting sands, but Palmerston sought to bring the bogs there, as well as > the sands ruined by sand, into cultivation. Palmerston began a building programme, renovating the old Market House which became a hotel, the Cliffoney Inn in 1820. A boys school was built next door in 1824 and a girls school at the north end of the village in 1826, replacing the old hedge school in Ahamlish. Palmerston immediately clashed with the Catholic priest Fr. John McHugh, the priest forbidding children attend either school unless a Catholic teacher was employed. In further improvements, Alexander Nimmo was engaged to construct a pier in Mullaghmore. While Nimmo was in Cliffoney he designed and constructed apartments for Palmerston over an extension at the back of the Cliffoney Hotel. \\"Nimmo, the designer of Mullaghmore Harbour supervised extensive renovations to the Inn in 1826 at the cost of ¬£385. 15s. 0d. The refurbishment included provision of a stone staircase, yard, stables and gateway.\\" The Roman Catholic church of Saint Molaise was completed and opened by 1828, slightly ahead of Catholic Emancipation. It replaced an earlier structure called Tempeall Bui, located behind the current village hall and close to Saint Bridget's well, probably demolished and reused in the new buildings. \\"In the build up to Catholic Emancipation, in February 1828, religious tensions caused a riot in Cliffoney with extra police required to calm the 239 strong crowd.\\" A parochial house called Palmerston Glebe was built in Creevymore for the use of the Catholic priests, with four acres of land attached. Palmerston hired an estate manager named John Lynch to oversee drainage and reclamation projects and built a two- story house called Rundale cottage. In the 1830's a tree nursery was established at Rundale. = Fr. Michael O'Flanagan = Fr. Michael O'Flanagan, Vice-President of Sinn F√©in, 1919. Fr. O'Flanagan was sent to Cliffoney at the end of July 1914, shortly before the start of WW1. O'Flanagan, a widely travelled curate with strong nationalist, socialist and republican ideals, may have been moved by Bishop Bernard Coyne for his support of the Sligo Dock Strike in May 1913. One of O'Flanagan's first initiatives was to write to Colonel Ashley of Classiebawn Castle, and he secured the old school house as a community hall for the villagers. Upon discovering social inequality in land redistribution, he led the villagers on a campaign against the Congested Districts Board to secure rights to cut turf on the Cloonerco Bogs adjacent to Cliffoney. This action, which began on 29 June 1915 became known as the Cloonerco Bog Fight. The case simmered on all summer, and the villagers harvested large quantities of turf which was distributed throughout the locality. Eventually the case was settled in favour of the people of Cliffoney. O'Flanagan was invited to attend the funeral of veteran Fenian Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa in August 1915. He gave a passionate speech at the Reception of Remains in City Hall, where he was photographed with Tom Clarke, Mary Jane and Eileen O'Donovan Rossa. At the graveside O'Flanagan recited the funeral prayers in Irish before his friend Padraig Pearse made his incendiary speech. In October O'Flanagan attended a tillage meeting held in Sligo Courthouse, where T. W. Russell was campaigning on behalf of the British Government, for increased tillage production to aid the war effort. When a motion to that effect was proposed, O'Flanagan objected and proposed a counter-motion, advising the people to \\"ignore the Board of Agriculture and adopt their own remedy...... They should 'Stick to the oats.' This call has ever since been associated with the curate of Cliffoney.\\" > O‚ÄôFlanagan‚Äôs speech ended with a rousing call: ‚ÄòThe famine of 1847 would > never have been written across the pages of history if the men of that day > were men enough to risk death rather than part with their oat crop. Let each > farmer keep at least as much oats on hand to carry himself and his family > through in case of necessity till next years harvest. Cover of From Cliffoney to Crosna, depicting a re-enactment of the turbury- rights protest led by Fr. Michael O'Flanagan in 1915. The speech was widely reported in the newspapers, and within days O'Flanagan was removed from Cliffoney by Bishop Coyne. In response, on 17 October the villagers of Cliffoney locked the door of St. Molaise's church, and refused to allow a replacement to enter, demanding instead that O'Flanagan be sent back to Cliffoney. The standoff, which became known as the \\"Cliffoney Rebellion\\" was to last for ten weeks. The people of Cliffoney knelt on the ground outside the locked church and said the Rosary for the return of O'Flanagan. The villagers marched 15 miles into Sligo to have an audience with the Bishop, but he refused to meet them. They also sent a petition to the Pope which was unsuccessful. Eventually the church was re-opened on Christmas Eve, 1915. An unfinished memoir, written by O'Flanagan in 1920, describes his version of the events that took place during his time in Cliffoney. The memoir was published as \\"From Cliffoney to Crosna\\" in 2016 by the Fr. O'Flanagan Memorial Group in Cliffoney. = Cliffoney Volunteers = A company of Volunteers was set up in Cliffoney with the guidance of Fr. O'Flanagan and Alec McCabe. > In November, 1915 I was introduced, with a few other men in the district, > into the I.R.B. (Irish Republican Brotherhood) by the late William Gilmartin > and Alec McCabe, then a National Teacher in Sligo. The I.R.B.

He gave us every assistance and encouragement and advised the > young men of the parish to join the Irish Volunteers. In all, forty men > joined the Cliffoney Company. The Cliffoney Company took over the Old Boy's School, and renamed it after Fr. O'Flanagan. The building was as a drilling and parade hall, even though it was just across the street from the R.I.C. barracks. The Cliffoney Company were out marching in uniform for Saint Patrick's Day 1916. > In his report at the end of March the County Inspector mentioned that a > branch of the Irish Volunteers had been formed at Cliffony and that other > branches were in the process of being formed.

They attended Mass at Cliffony and then \\"paraded the roads.\\" Their > leaders, William Gilmartin and Andrew Conway, carried revolvers, he > reported. On the same day, he said. Alec McCabe led a parade of 69 \\"Sinn > F√©iners\\" in Ballymote. McCabe was reported as wearing the uniform of the > Irish Volunteers and the others wearing Irish Volunteer armbands. They were ready for action a month later for the Easter Insurrection 1916, with orders to march along the route to Sligo capturing R.I.C. barracks along the way, but stood down when Eoin MacNeil's countermanding order came from Dublin. > The Cliffony Volunteers mobilised in the early hours of Easter Monday, 60 > strong, including Fianna boys.

The Volunteers remained in readiness for > over a week in the hope of taking part in the rebellion but with the > surrender in Dublin all hope ended and they disbanded. \\"On Sunday April 30th, the day after the surrender in Dublin, a parade was held by the Irish Volunteers in Cliffony. No arms were carried.\\" On 6 May some sixty soldiers from the North Staffordshire regiment arrived in Sligo by train. They proceeded by car to Cliffony on the morning of 7 May with orders to arrest any Volunteers at large in the area. The Cliffoney Company forewarned, but fifteen men were arrested and subsequently deported first to Sligo Goal, then Dublin and finally Wandsworth prison close to London.  The Moneygold Ambush 1920  The R.I.C. barracks in Cliffoney, occupying the corner opposite the church, hall and hotel, was constructed on Lord Palmerston's orders in 1842, after some surveyors in his employment were beaten up by disgruntled locals. At the time he was having his land \\"squared\\" which entailed reorganising landholdings and leases on his Ahamlish estates. The R.I.C. became a constant presence in the village from 1842 until 1921. On 25 October 1920, Sergeant Perry led a bicycle patrol of eight constables to investigate a case of malicious damage in Magherow. The group, which left Cliffoney barracks at 11.00 am, cycled into an ambush at Derry cross close to Ahamlish graveyard at 11.30 am. Some thirty to forty members of the North Sligo I.R.A., led by Liam Pilkington and Seamus Devins opened fire on the R.I.C., killing three instantly and wounding three more. The remaining three constables surrendered. Sergeant Patrick Perry, Constables Patrick Laffey and Patrick Keown died at the scene. Constables Lynch, Clarke and O'Rourke were wounded, with Patrick Lynch dying of his wounds that evening. Constables Spratt, McCormack and Joyce unhurt. > The three uninjured constables were deprived of their weapons and the > weapons of the dead and wounded were collected. The ambushers then left the > scene as the Angelus bell was ringing. One of the ambushers in fact had the > job of ringing the bell and the ambush was over just in time to allow him to > race across the fields to ring the bell at Grange church.  The Moneygold reprisals  A few days after the ambush, E Company of the Auxiliaries based in Coolavin came to north Sligo to search for the ambushers and to make reprisals. > At Moneygold eight miles from Sligo (between Grange and Cliffony in Co. > Sligo), the IRA ambush an nine-man RIC patrol, killing four. The IRA was led > by Sligo Brigade O/C William Pilkington. Auxiliaries, who were stationed at > the residence of The McDermott in Coolavin, traveled to north Sligo some > time after the ambush and searched the countryside for the ambushers. The > County Inspector reported. \\"The houses of some leading suspects were burned > as well as the Father O'Flanagan Sinn F√©in Hall at Cliffony\\". The Crown > forces threw a cordon around the Grange area and spent two nights searching > for the ambushers. Many houses were burned. The burnings continued over a number of nights throughout North Sligo. Several cottages in Grange village and the Temperance hall were burned, as was Ballintrillick creamery. In Cliffoney, ten cottages along the main road, all belonging to prominent Sinn F√©in members, and the Fr. O'Flanagan Sinn F√©in Hall in the village were also burned, and the legend \\"Vacated Home of Murder Gang\\" was painted on the front of the hall. Gillespie's Tailor shop in the village was raided, and all the contents taken out into the street and burned. Amenities Stained glass window by Joshua Clarke, St. Molaise's RC church, Cliffoney, installed 1909.Cliffoney village is arranged around a cross-roads on the N15 with the church, community hall, public house and old RIC barracks each occupying a corner. Cliffoney National school was opened in 1914, replacing the old schools built by Lord Palmerston. President Michael D. Higgins visited Cliffoney National school on 22 October 2014 to commemorate the centenary of its opening. = Church of St. Molaise = The Roman Catholic church is dedicated to Saint Molaise from Inishmurray island. The church was opened in 1828, replacing an older structure called Teampeall Bui down the hill and close to Saint Briget's well. Cliffoney church was closed for an extensive period in 1915 when the whole village united in protest against the Bishop of Elphin, Dr. Bernard Coyne, who had removed Fr. Michael O'Flanagan. The protest which was widely reported in the newspapers, continued for ten weeks until Christmas Eve 1915. > In October Fr O'Flanagan was transferred by his Bishop to the parish of > Crossna, County Roscommom. His parishioners saw this as punishment for his > involvement with the bog dispute and did not take kindly to the move. They > locked up the church at Cliffony and refused to hand over the key to the new > curate, Fr McHugh. This dispute continued until Christmas Day 1915. On that > morning the key to Cliffony church was handed to the Parish Priest. The > people meanwhile were presumably enjoying the warmth of the C.D.B. turf. A holy water font was installed in the porch of St. Molaise's church in 1942 in memory of Fr. O'Flanagan, on condition that his name was not to be added. The plaque, with name finally allowed, was added in 1992. The church was closed again during restoration in 2012 and masses were held in the village hall. During cleaning the restorers discovered that the three stained glass windows behind the altar were made by Joshua Clarke, father of the renowned stained glass artist Harry Clarke. Joshua Clarke was married to Brigid MacGonigall, a native of Cliffoney village. = Cliffoney Hall = The village community hall dates to 1824. The building came into the possession community in 1915 due to the work of Father Michael O'Flanagan. The building became the Cliffoney Sinn F√©in club and was used for drilling by the Cliffoney Volunteers. The hall was burned at the end of October 1920 during the reprisals for the Moneygold ambush. It was later rebuilt and renamed the more neutral Cliffoney Parochial Hall. The hall was renovated in 2016 with the addition of a new kitchen and restrooms. The hall is used for many community activities and fundraisers. Bingo is held every Saturday evening. The building hosts active age sessions, social dancing and dance classes, Irish dancing, guitar and martial arts classes.Cliffoney Country Market takes place in the village hall twice each month. The mural on the gable of O'Donnell's Bar was painted in 2015.There are several businesses located in the village, including a hair salon, two pubs, a restaurant, and a craft shop. There is one shop in the village, Cliffoney Gala, which underwent a refurbishment in September 2017. Cliffoney Garda station was closed in early February 2013. The station was handed over to the Cliffoney Development Group by Minister Brian Hayes in July 2014, with plans for the building to be used as a men's shed or tourist office. However, nothing has been done with the station since that time. Cliffoney post office was under threat of closure; however, in August 2018 after a local campaign, it was announced that it will remain open for a further three years, while 159 other post offices would shut down nationwide.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable polyester with a low melting point of around 60 ¬∞C and a glass transition temperature of about ‚àí60 ¬∞C. The most common use of polycaprolactone is in the production of speciality polyurethanes. Polycaprolactones impart good resistance to water, oil, solvent and chlorine to the polyurethane produced. This polymer is often used as an additive for resins to improve their processing characteristics and their end use properties (e.g., impact resistance). Being compatible with a range of other materials, PCL can be mixed with starch to lower its cost and increase biodegradability or it can be added as a polymeric plasticizer to polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Polycaprolactone is also used for splinting, modeling, and as a feedstock for prototyping systems such as fused filament fabrication 3D printers. Synthesis PCL is prepared by ring opening polymerization of Œµ-caprolactone using a catalyst such as stannous octoate. Recently a wide range of catalysts for the ring opening polymerization of caprolactone have been reviewed. 400px  Biomedical applications  PCL is degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions (such as in the human body) and has therefore received a great deal of attention for use as an implantable biomaterial. In particular it is especially interesting for the preparation of long term implantable devices, owing to its degradation which is even slower than that of polylactide. PCL has been widely used in long-term implants and controlled drug release applications. However, when it comes to tissue engineering, PCL suffers from some shortcomings such as slow degradation rate, poor mechanical properties, and low cell adhesion. The incorporation of calcium phosphate-based ceramics and bioactive glasses into PCL has yielded a class of hybrid biomaterials with remarkably improved mechanical properties, controllable degradation rates, and enhanced bioactivity that are suitable for bone tissue engineering. PCL has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in specific applications used in the human body as (for example) a drug delivery device, suture, or adhesion barrier. PCL is used in the rapidly growing field of human esthetics following the recent introduction of a PCL-based microsphere dermal filler belonging to the collagen stimulator class (Ellans√©). Through the stimulation of collagen production, PCL-based products are able to correct facial ageing signs such as volume loss and contour laxity, providing an immediate and long- lasting natural effect. It is being investigated as a scaffold for tissue repair by tissue engineering, GBR membrane. It has been used as the hydrophobic block of amphiphilic synthetic block copolymers used to form the vesicle membrane of polymersomes. A variety of drugs have been encapsulated within PCL beads for controlled release and targeted drug delivery. In dentistry (as the composite named Resilon), it is used as a component of \\"night guards\\" (dental splints) and in root canal filling. It performs like gutta-percha, has similar handling properties, and for re-treatment purposes may be softened with heat, or dissolved with solvents like chloroform. Similar to gutta-percha, there are master cones in all ISO sizes and accessory cones in different sizes and taper available. The major difference between the polycaprolactone-based root canal filling material (Resilon and Real Seal) and gutta-percha is that the PCL-based material is biodegradable, whereas gutta- percha is not. There is a lack of consensus in the expert dental community as to whether a biodegradable root canal filling material, such as Resilon or Real Seal is desirable. Hobbyist and prototyping Home-made bicycle light mounting, made from PCL PCL also has many applications in the hobbyist market where it is known as Polydoh, Plastimake, NiftyFix, Protoplastic, InstaMorph, Polymorph, Shapelock, ReMoldables, Plastdude or TechTack. It has physical properties of a very tough, nylon-like plastic that softens to a putty-like consistency at only 60 ¬∞C, easily achieved by immersing in hot water. PCL's specific heat and conductivity are low enough that it is not hard to handle by hand at this temperature. This makes it ideal for small-scale modeling, part fabrication, repair of plastic objects, and rapid prototyping where heat resistance is not needed. Though softened PCL readily sticks to many other plastics when at higher temperature, if the surface is cooled, the stickiness can be minimized while still leaving the mass pliable. Biodegradation Firmicutes and proteobacteria can degrade PCL. Penicillium sp. strain 26-1 can degrade high density PCL; though not as quickly as thermotolerant Aspergillus sp. strain ST-01. Species of Clostridium can degrade PCL under anaerobic conditions.

He was one of the original settlers of Augusta and an early settler of Busselton. Early life The outline of John Molloy's birth and early life are believed by some to be clear, though we have little detail and published accounts vary greatly. This is just one possible version that he was the same John Molloy who was baptised at St Martins in the Fields in Trafalgar Square, London, on 8 October 1786, the son of William and Mary Molloy.St Martin in the Fields parish register As John celebrated his birthday on the 5 September in later life, his birthdate may have been 5 September 1786. This William Molloy had a shoe warehouse at 16 High St, St Giles, London. He made his will in 1804, leaving bequests to his son, John, and his daughter, Susanna, who were to inherit their shares of the estate when they reached the age of 21.PCC Prob 11, 1419 folio 37 The will also stipulates regular payments from the estate to William Molloy's mother who was living in Kings County, now co. Offaly, Ireland. St Giles was well known as a quarter where Irish tradesmen settled. William Molloy died in December 1804. John Molloy was able to buy a commission in the Rifle Brigade on 17 December 1807, just over three months after his 21st birthday, when he came into his inheritance. He fought in the Peninsular War of 1808‚Äì10 and was promoted Lieutenant in 1809. Then, during a two-year break in military engagements, he attended the Royal Military College, Great Marlow. From 1812 to 1814, he fought in the Napoleonic Wars under Wellington, taking part in eight battles. In 1815 he fought at Waterloo where he was badly wounded and received the Waterloo Medal. After recovering his health, he returned to active duty, being posted to Glasgow in 1819‚Äì20, then Ireland until 1825. In 1824 he was promoted to Captain. Emigration to Western Australia On 6 August 1829, Molloy married Georgiana Kennedy, and began to consider emigrating to Western Australia. The Molloys eventually sailed for Western Australia on board the Warrior in October 1829. On arriving at the Swan River Colony in March 1830, Molloy was advised by Governor Stirling that the best land in the area had already been granted. Stirling suggested instead that the Molloys join with some other newly arrived settlers in forming a subcolony in the vicinity of Cape Leeuwin. Late in April, a group of prospective settlers including the Molloys and Bussells accompanied Stirling and his official party to the proposed site of the subcolony. After a four-day exploring expedition up the Blackwood River, Stirling confirmed his decision to establish a settlement at the location. The settlers' possessions were unloaded, and Molloy was appointed Government Resident and Resident magistrate for the settlement, to be called Augusta. Settlement at Augusta and move to Busselton For the first few years of the settlement, Molloy's main tasks, other than establishment of his own farm, were the allocation of land, and laying out of the townsite. When Molloy named the streets and coastal features of Augusta in 1832, he chose the names and titles of the Duke of York, who had died five years previously: Osnaburg Street, York Street, Albany Terrace, Duke's Head and Point Frederick. In 1839 he moved to Busselton, and began to work on building a property called Fair Lawn in what is now Bovell. He became the town's first magistrate, which he found more complicated than at Augusta because of the presence of American whalers and difficult relationships with the Indigenous Australians. Later life Molloy's wife died in 1843, but he decided to stay on at Busselton. In 1850, he visited England, returning to Western Australia in 1852. On his return, he continued as Busselton's magistrate, dealing with the arrival of convicts. In 1859 he transferred to the 9th Foot and was promoted Major and Lieutenant-Colonel, but sold the commission the same day. He resigned as Government Resident in March 1851 on grounds of old age. From 1860 on, he gradually turned over management of his property to Richard Gale. He died on 6 October 1867, and was buried alongside his wife. The age given on Molloy‚Äôs grave, 87, is inaccurate: it should be 81.The date of Molloy's baptism and his father's will both suggest an age of 87 is highly unlikely. If 87 in 1867, John would have been about 24 in 1804 when his father's will mentions him as under 21. John Molloy's eldest daughter Sabina married Matthew Blagden Hale, who became the first Anglican Bishop of Perth. Another daughter Flora married William Locke Brockman. References *Barry, Bernice.

Reverend Terrence O'Rorke has previously also suggested Culmaine as Collooney is designed in such works as the Four Masters, Dudley M'Firlis and O'Flaherty's \\"Chrorographical description of West Connaught\\"; and he further suggests \\"Angle of the Whirlpool\\" from the confluence of the Uncion and Owenmore as the most likely origin of the name. The settlement was also at times previously termed Cashel, KillinBridge or even Cowlowney. History During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a battle took place outside the town in which a combined French and Irish force defeated British troops from the Sligo garrison. Known as the Battle of Collooney (or Battle of Carricknagat), this conflict is commemorated by the Teeling Monument outside the town - named for a member of the United Irishmen who was involved in the battle. In the 18th century and bleach mill was built locally by Charles O'Hara in an effort to increase industry in the Sligo area. O'Hara brought in weavers and bleachers from the north to settle in the Collooney area. The mill finally closed in 1956. The mill was also used at certain times in its history for the production of carbide, a mixture of coal, coke and lime. Geography Old Mill building The main part of the town lies to south west of the Owenmore River which joins the Unshin River just to the north of the town to form the Ballysadare River. Transport Collooney is located just off the N4 (Dublin to Sligo) and N17 (Sligo to Galway) roads, having been bypassed twice, by the N4 in 1998, and the N17 in 1992, and is the meeting point of both roads. The town was a significant railway centre, with no less than three railway stations. In addition to the one remaining Collooney railway station, opened on 3 December 1862, (on the railway from Dublin to Sligo) there was a station on the line to Claremorris (The Western Railway Corridor) and on the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway line to Enniskillen.

U.S. Law In American federal law, Title provides: The term subornation of perjury further describes the circumstance wherein an attorney at law causes a client to lie under oath or, allows another party to lie under oath. In California law, per the state bar code,In re Rivas (1989) 49 Cal.3d 794, 263 California Reporter. 654, 781 P.2d 946 the subornation of perjury constitutes an act of \\"moral turpitude\\" on the part of the attorney, and thus, is cause for his or her disbarment, or for the suspension of his or her license to practice law.California Business & Professions Code ¬ß6102(a) In legal practice As a crime, it has been defined as \\"persuading another to commit perjury.\\" But \\"suborn\\" is more broadly defined. Amongst three definitions: to induce a person to commit a wrongful act ... esp. in a secret or underhanded manner; to induce a person to commit perjury; and to obtain perjured testimony from another. In legal practice, the condition of suborning perjury applies to an attorney who presents either testimony or an affidavit, or both, either to a judge or to a jury, which the attorney knows to be materially false, and not factual. In civil law and in criminal law, the attorney's knowledge that the testimony is materially false must rise above mere suspicion to what an attorney would reasonably have believed in the circumstances of the matter discussed in the testimony. Hence, the attorney cannot be wilfully blind to the fact that his or her witness is giving false, perjurious testimony. An attorney who encourages a witness to give false testimony is suborning perjury, a crime punished either with formal disciplinary action, disbarment, jail, or a combination thereof. A false statement by an attorney in court also is a crime similar to subornation of perjury and is punished accordingly. In the professional conduct of an attorney at law, there is a fine delineation between assisting a witness to recall events and encouraging the witness to give materially false testimony. The practice of ‚Ä≥horse shedding the witness‚Ä≥ (rehearsing testimony) (also known as woodshedding), is an example of such perjurious criminal conduct by an attorney, which is depicted in the true- crime novel Anatomy of a Murder (1958), by Robert Traver John D. Voelker, a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court and in the eponymous film (Otto Preminger, 1959), about a rape-and-murder case wherein are explored the ethical and legal problems inherent to the subornation of perjury.\\"Horse shedding\\" term, Quote it Completely!

It is 8 km (5 miles) north of Sligo town on the N15 road on a low gravel ridge between the mountain of Ben Bulben and Drumcliff bay. It is on the Drumcliff river, originally called the \\"Codnach\\", which drains Glencar Lake. Drumcliff is the resting place of the Irish poet W. B. Yeats. History The old name of Drumcliff was Cnoc na Teagh (trans. Hill of the House). The village is one of several possible locations in Co. Sligo for the settlement of Nagnata as marked on Claudius Ptolemy's early map of Ireland. The name Codnach means placid or even tempered river. A battle was fought on this river in A.M. 3656 (1538 BC) by the legendary Milesian monarch Tigearnmas. Tigernmas. cath Codnaige in Tuath Eba in Cairpre moir Droma Cliab, fought by Tigernmas AFM An ancient topographical poem in the Dinnsenchus (Lore of Places) tells how the baskets in the name refer to the wicker frames of a fleet of boats that was once made here. The poem is part of a lost epic story involving the Fomorians in a raid on an island in the western ocean. Drumcliff formed the western extremity of the kingdom of Br√©ifne (the eastern end was Kells), and the northern extremity of Tir Fhiacrach M√∫aidhe (Tireragh). The Battle of the Book took place near Drumcliff between the years 555 AD and 561 AD.

It is on the Atlantic coast, 26 miles from Sligo and 15 miles from Ballina, County Mayo. The village name derives from the Irish language term for fish (\\"iasc\\") and \\"Iascaigh\\" literally means \\"abounding in fish\\", due to the Easky River that lies adjacent to the village itself. Easky, as a parish, was originally called \\"Imleach Iseal\\". The area is a tourist destination due to its scenery and water sports. Easky is a designated area on Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way tourist route. History St Anne's Church of Ireland The parish of Easky is part of the barony of Tireragh. Tireragh is a corruption of T√≠r Fh√≠acrach M√∫aidhe in Irish, meaning \\"the land of Fiachra of the Moy\\". This tuath was founded by the U√≠ Fiachrach Muaidhe, who were, themselves, a branch of the U√≠ Fiachrach dynasty of Connachta. Easky was originally named \\"Imleach Iseal/Isil\\" which means the \\"low imleach\\", or \\"low land verging on the water\\". The first settlements in the area seem to have taken residence in Castletown, a townland that exists to the west of the present-day village. Geologists have become increasingly interested in the rugged coastline around Easky, as it holds fossil structures that date back for millions of years. In John O'Donovan's textbook The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of Hy-Fiachrach, commonly called O'Dowd's Country, it is documented that a man called Maoldubh, a son of Fiachra Ealgach (the son of King Daithi), was born and bred in Easky and established a fort in the area called \\"Dun Maoilduibh\\". In O'Donovan's book, Easky is also mentioned through the following reference: \\"To Iasca, of the land of the white-blossomed apple-trees, Belongs the O'Mailduns of high renown.\\" This is a reference to a powerful clan known ‚Äì in modern parlance ‚Äì as the O'Muldoons, a surname that is virtually non-existent in the area today. They held the \\"mansion seat\\" in Castletown and were defenders of the area at large. In Samuel Lewis's 1837 publication of A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, Easky was described as having 6,124 inhabitants, of which 289 were in the village. Lewis noted that the village (made up of one long street) had petty sessions every fortnight and that Wednesday was market day. As well as other more ancient architectural remains, he records the \\"considerable remains of the old castle of Rosslee, formerly belonging to the O'Dowds\\" and another castle in the Castletown townland. Landmarks Landmarks in the area include O'Dowd Castle, which was built in 1207, and became home to the O'Dowd chieftains of Tireragh (the barony of much of West Sligo). The castle was originally built for Oliver McDonnell who came to the area to marry an O'Dowd widow. Located beside Easky pier, much of the original structure of the castle has been lost over time, yet the main body of the castle remains. Rathlee signal tower is an early 19th century coastal defence fortification near Easky In the centre of the village is the Old Abbey and graveyard which dates back to medieval times and remained in use until 1888. Another graveyard, Roslea Cemetery, lies to the east of the village, in the townland of Aderavoher. It was opened in 1888 and was extended in 2005. Easky Bridge bridge, built in 1847, provides access to the main village from the Sligo side of the area. It contains the Bullance stone, which is built into the bridge wall and is a symbolic drinking trough, which qualified the village to hold a \\"Fair Day\\". Hangings took place at the bridge in the 19th century. Easky Courthouse, opposite the local vocational school, was built circa 1870. At the start of the 20th century, the County Sligo court held its sessions here. The building was attacked during the Irish Civil War. In 2010, the Courts Service of Ireland announced that Easky Courthouse would no longer hold its monthly sessions. Local amenities The village itself has two caf√©s, a take-away, two pubs, a general shop, gift-shop, a butcher, a hairdresser, a post-office, a pottery shop, St James's Roman Catholic church (which dates back to 1833) and St Anne's Church of Ireland (which dates back to 1820), a community centre with caravan and camping area and a History and Genealogy Centre. To the east of the village is the local vocational school, Col√°iste Iascaigh. The parish of Easky has three primary schools situated in the townlands of Rathlee, Killeenduff and Owenbeg. Another primary school is located in Easky village but has been closed since 2003. A creche now operates in this building. Sport =Gaelic football= The local Gaelic football club, Easkey GAA, was founded in 1888, just four years after the formation of the Gaelic Athletic Association. They were amongst the first teams to compete in the first Sligo Senior Football Championship of 1888, playing St John's in Collooney on 11 March 1888. The club was the focus of a segment of the RT√â series Reeling in the Years. In the 1986 episode, it was highlighted that the club had lost 15 players (a full team) due to emigration to Britain and the USA. The club holds five Sligo Senior Football Championship titles, last contesting the 1999 Senior-Championship final (in which they were defeated by Tourlestrane). =Water sports= Easky is known for its surfing areas, including two reef breaks. In 1979, the Pro/Am Surfing World Championships came to Easky. Various national surfing events continue to be held here. In 1995 the Irish Surfing Association established its headquarters in the Easky Surf and Information Centre on Main Street. The building, now known as \\"Easkey House\\" is located in the centre of Easky village. The Easky River is used for kayaking and canoeing. In 2003, Easky hosted the World Surf Kayaking Championships. =Walking= There are several walking routes around the river estuary and coastline (with views of the Slieve League and Benbulbin mountains) and through the local woods in the townland of Fortland.  Culture  The writer Jack Harte was born in the Easky townland of Killeenduff, where his father was the local blacksmith. The sculptor Fred Conlon was born and grew up in Killeenduff, Easky. The mother of Irish playwrights Martin McDonagh (director of the film In Bruges) and John Michael McDonagh (director of The Guard) comes from Easky. John Michael McDonagh filmed Calvary in Easky village and the surrounding area. Local townlands The parish of Easky contains numerous localised townland names.

Born Eliza Rosanna Gilbert in Sligo, Lola caught the eye of Bavaria's King Ludwig I in 1846 by claiming to be an exotic dancer from Spain. Although married, the king took up with the girl from Grange, even making her the Duchess of Landsfeld. Bavarian citizens put up with their king's cavorting, but their patience snapped when his courtesan began meddling in state affairs. Ludwig was forced to abdicate and Lola had to flee. She never saw him again, but she remained a duchess. =Spanish Armada= Three Spanish Armada transport ships - La Lavia, La Juliana and the Santa Maria de Vison - were lost off Streedagh strand in September 1588,Flanagan, L (1988).

One of the survivors, Captain Francisco de Cu√©llar, recorded the events of the time in detail. He documents his shipwreck at Streedagh, the subsequent events ashore, and his attempts to find hospitality from local chieftains (O'Rourke and McClancy) in the then English garrisoned North Sligo, as he made his way back to Spain via Antrim and Scotland. In 1985 at Streedagh Strand, marine archaeologists discovered the wreck site of the three ships of the Spanish Armada. In spring 2015, after storms sent some artifacts onto Streedagh Strand, Ireland's Department of Arts, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht sent divers to recover what the storms had uncovered. One particular find was a bronze cannon decorated with the image of Saint Matrona of Barcelona, which bears the initial \\"D\\" on its touchhole ‚Äì the mark of the Genoese gunfounder Girardi Dorino II. Other pieces with this mark recovered from the wreck indicate that he cast most of what became La Juliana's bronze ordnance. The cannon is dated 1570, which corresponds to the date of La Juliana's construction; according to the Irish government, this puts the identity of the third wreck \\"beyond doubt\\".

It is a descendant of the 42nd Battalion Royal Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums, which was active during the First World War. = Activities = The Pipes and Drums have appeared at many events over the years, with appearances including The Ed Sullivan Show, military tattoos and highland games throughout North America (including games in Fort Ticonderoga, Miami, and the Stone Mountain Highland Games and Tattoo near Atlanta). The Black Watch have played at the United States Bicentennial in 1976 and for the Trooping of the Colour in London. It was the only foreign band to march in the parade celebrating the Bicentennial of the American Constitution and was one of many bands at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's 90th and 100th Birthday celebrations on Horse Guards Parade.  Traditions  As members of a royal regiment, the pipers wear the Royal Stewart tartan, which is the tartan of the current monarch.The regimental drummers wear the Government tartan, which came to be known as the Black Watch tartan due to its dark hue. Alliances * - Royal Regiment of Scotland BCS #2 Cadet Corps Bishop's College School (BCS) Cadet Corps #2, the oldest continuous service corps in Canada, was formed in 1861 as the Volunteer Rifle Company in the Fenian Raids by the BCS Rector/BU Principal Rev. Dr. Thomas Adams (Oxford). The Cadets crops have historically grown many military leaders such as Andrew McNaughton, Commander-in-chief, and the minister of national defense of Canada during WWII. BCS Annual Cadet Inspection BCS, the private co-ed secondary school has been affiliated with the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada since 1936 and also with the Royal Canadian Army Cadets in 1879. Over 120 former students are sacrificed in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. In early May each year, the Corps sends two platoons and the Colour Party to march with the Regiment in their Church Parade. The Annual Corps review is held on the Friday of May long weekend; this event includes demonstrations by the drill team and the cadet band. Today, the Corps plays a major role in the lives of students, schools, and communities. The program, compulsory for all students, is organized and run almost entirely by senior cadets and Black Watch officers. Instruction is given in skills such as first aid, outdoor survival, shooting, archery, and service-type activities and focuses on leadership education. Returning cadets carry out and organize a number of service-orientated activities. Music Gallant Black Watch, a Scotch style march and two-step, was composed by Bert L. Billings and published in Toronto by Whaley, Royce & Co., circa 1906.

Retrieved: 2012-03-21. is a village on the Mullaghmore peninsula in County Sligo, Ireland. It is a holiday destination with a skyline dominated by Ben Bulben mountain. It is in the barony of Carbury and parish of Ahamlish. History From the 17th to the 19th centuries it was part of the large estate belonging to the Temple family in north Sligo. The land, some 12,000 acres, was granted to Sir John Temple, 1st Viscount Palmerston and Master of the Rolls in Dublin. The 3rd Viscount, Henry John Temple, better known as Lord Palmerston, began the building of the castle of Classiebawn, a baronial-style house standing on the peninsula. He also built the stone-walled harbour in the village, which was designed by the marine engineer Alexander Nimmo. It was built between 1822 and 1841. The Temples were mostly absentee landlords, with the estate being run initially by middlemen, and later by land agents, such as Stewart and Kincaid, a Dublin firm with offices in Sligo. These agents, in their attempts to make the estates profitable, oversaw the \\"assisted emigration\\" that took place on the Palmerston and adjacent Gore Booth (Lissadell) estate that began before the Great Famine and continued until at least the 1860s. Thus, in May 1862, a Sligo newspaper reported: \\"In accordance with a custom of some years' standing, about sixty persons have been selected for emigration from the Parish of Ahamlish ... whose passages and outfit has been provided by his Lordship. They consist of twenty-four young girls, and twenty young men ... [and] families who were wholly unable to support themselves ... who had asked the favour of being sent out ... The emigrants took their passages ... this day, for Liverpool, en route for America.\\" Classiebawn Castle Lord Palmerston presided over Mullaghmore and North Sligo during the worst years of the Great Famine of the mid-19th century. During the summer and autumn of 1847, nine vessels, carrying over 2,000 persons left Sligo port with tenants evicted and \\"shovelled out\\" from his Sligo estates. They arrived in Canada half naked and totally destitute. The city of St. John in the Canadian province of New Brunswick had to take many of Palmerston's evicted tenants into care and, outraged, sent a scathing letter to Palmerston expressing regret and fury that he or his agents, ‚Äòshould have exposed such a numerous and distressed portion of his tenantry to the severity and privation of a New Brunswick winter ... unprovided with the common means of support, with broken down constitutions and almost in a state of nudity ... without regard to humanity or even common decency.‚Äô The graves of many of these unfortunate victims can be seen today on the old quarantine station, now a museum, at Grosse Ille near Quebec. Classiebawn was a favoured holiday retreat of Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the last Viceroy of India, who had inherited Classiebawn Castle. It was off the Mullaghmore coast in August 1979 that Lord Mountbatten, along with his fourteen-year-old grandson Nicholas Knatchbull, The Dowager Baroness Brabourne and County Fermanagh teenager Paul Maxwell, were killed by a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA. In 2007 it hosted the final stage of Rally Ireland. Surfing Mullaghmore is a big wave surfing destination.

A North American low- pressure system moved east and combined with another cyclone in the Western Atlantic. This system moved into an area off the coast of Ireland that already had high waves owing to a series of strong systems the previous week. In addition, a strong anticyclone over the Azores created a large pressure gradient in the North Atlantic that directed a strong fetch towards Ireland. There was also an extended fetch length in the North Atlantic in the direction of Europe while the swell was created.

Topics of the Rubble film * Problems of returning soldiers * The poverty, suffering and distress in post-war Germany * Stunde Null * Confrontation with the past, particularly with issues of collective guilt * Crime and punishment * War damage and war losses * Life among the rubble * Reconstruction The rubble aesthetic The desolation left as a consequence of the bombing that Germany endured before the end of World War II left the major German cities in shambles. However, unlike other cities, Berlin's structures had steel frames. This enabled many of them to remain standing, despite the bombings. This left jagged figures on the landscape, as well as a lot of rubble on the ground. Often, directors would have either horizontal or vertical shots of the rubble from a low angle.Rubble in the Tr√ºmmerfilm> The Murderers Are Among Us begins with a ground shot facing upwards showing a Berlin street, complete with piles of rubble, and destroyed buildings. The viewer sees several children running around, and the protagonist ambling up the street. The viewer also sees German citizens working together to clean up, and getting on with their lives, despite the devastation. Critics have observed similarities between the rubble film aesthetic and Weimar era Expressionism, as well as Romanticism. These features include gloomy environments, canted angles and chiaroscuro lighting, along with morally ambiguous protagonists. It has been argued by Gertrud Koch that, aside from the expressionist and neorealistic qualities of the Rubble Film, a major purpose of these films was to re-invigorate the German people, and instill a work ethic that would facilitate the reconstruction of Germany.The Place of Rubble in the Trummerfilm> Filmpause In the year after the war ended, no films were made. This one-year period is referred to as the Filmpause, and is due in large part to the destruction or seizure of Germany's film studios, as well as artistic uncertainty. Furthermore, people had little interest in seeing films, much less the facilities with which to do so.Rubble in the Tr√ºmmerfilm> This uncertainty was caused by Hitler's delegitimization of conventional filmmaking practices, which forced filmmakers to reinvent their filmography methods, and film content. It was not until Wolfgang Staudte released The Murderers Are Among Us in 1946 that German Cinema began to further develop.  Reception  Originally, the name \\"Tr√ºmmerfilm\\" held negative connotation. These films were seen as a symbol of defeat and desolation. They symbolized the control that the German Nazis had over the German people, as well as the success of the Allies in destroying their country. Instead of offering a nostalgic attachment to what Germany was, it simply was a mark of trauma and despair. The German identity had been stripped by the Nazi party, and they felt that these films did little more than re-affirm the horrors that Germany suffered.Rubble, Ruins and Romanticism The genre has also received criticism for its whitewashing of Nazi history. In the film The Murderers Are Among Us, the female protagonist Susanne returns from a concentration camp and is shocked by the misery of Germans in the cities. A common trope in the rubble films is the highlighting of German soldiers' trauma at the expense of relegating the suffering of political and racial enemies of the Third Reich. The dwelling on wartime trauma is not in itself a cause for concern. But the omission of any depictions of Nazi violence, in a genre so consumed with expressing suffering, is a criticized feature of the Heimkehrerfilm, a genre centered around returning veterans' trauma and re-adjustment to civilian life.German Postwar Films Bibliography Category:Film genres Category:Cinema of Germany ","title":"Tr√ºmmerfilm"},{"id":"2097458","text":"Rosses Point (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/G100001B.html or ) is a village in County Sligo, Ireland and also the name of the surrounding peninsula.

History St Adomn√°n, the first biographer of St Columba (Colmcille) and one of his successors at Iona, first served as abbot at Skreen Abbey, which allegedly acquired its name from the relics of Adomn√°n. The abbey was possessed by Viking raiders in the 9th century, who pillaged and razed it. Besides his Columba biography, Adomn√°n is known for the the \\"Law of the Innocents\\", protecting women, children, and other non-combatants from being casualties of war. The name Adamnan is, according to Cormac's Glossary, an Irish diminutive of Adam. It is generally pronounced in three syllables, but its proper Irish pronunciation is Awnaun, the \\"d\\" and the \\"m\\" being both aspirated. In the life of St Farannan, published by Colgan, we are informed that Tibraide, lord of Tir Fhiachrach, bestowed on St Columba a place called ; but that it was subsequently called from a shrine that saint erected there. From this shrine the parish of Skreen in County Sligo derived its name. There, he is called Awnaun, and his well, Toberawnaun (which gives name to a townland), lies a little south of the old church.P. W. Joyce, Irish Names of Places, p. 156. The Abbey, of which there is no remaining trace, was located at the site of the present Skreen Church of Ireland church, next to which are an old graveyard and the extensive remains of the medieval church. Within the ruin is the gravesite of Reverend Gabriel Stokes, a 19th-century parson of the Church of Ireland parish and father of mathematician Sir George Stokes. In the graveyard may be found many fine 18th-19th-century limestone box tombs, the most celebrated of which is the 1824 Alexander Black tomb, carved by \\"Old Frank\\" Diamond. His descendants are still, after seven generations, in the stonecutting business on the Coast Road. Also in the parish are the considerable ruins of Ardnaglass Castle, originally a possession of the O'Dowds, then the MacSweeneys, and after the Cromwellian conquest the Joneses and the Blacks. It is just off the Coast Road on Protestant lane. It is now owned by Gerry Clarke. There are two churches in Skreen, one Church of Ireland and the other Roman Catholic.

On February 14, 2012, the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called an end to the bid, citing uncertain costs and unknown financial benefit. The announcement came a day before the deadline for applicant cities to submit the application files. The project would have transformed the area of south-east of Rome. The two main buildings of the project the Sport Forum and Swimming Forum are symmetrical; each of them is about in area and about 75 m in height. The complex, whose construction began in April 2007, was to be completed in 2009 in time for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships but is still under construction. The new university tower, located on the opposite side of the road with respect to the City of Sport project, will rise to about 90 meters, whose penultimate floor would host the new administrative office of Tor Vergata, while the top floor would host a wide lobby that would offer panoramic views. The lower floors would welcome other offices. The layer below the tower would accommodate underground parking. Academics The university is divided into six schools: Economics, Engineering, Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine and Sciences. There are 19 departments; combined, they offer 31 PhD programmes and 120 Masters programmes. The university offers 114 undergraduate degree programs (three-year degree, single-cycle), 9 of which are taught in English.

History It is suggested the development of Strandhill can be attributed to a Benjamin Murrow who purchased the undeveloped land from the upper road in 1895 for ¬£1,760. He constructed a roadway to the sea for ¬£1000, and offered plots either side of the roadway, which he named Buenos Ayres Drive. In 1912 he constructed a bathhouse to attract visitors. Buenos Ayres drive was conveyed into public ownership in 1928, and the strip of land to the shore in 1936.

Gelsinger suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an X-linked genetic disease of the liver, the symptoms of which include an inability to metabolize ammonia ‚Äì a byproduct of protein breakdown. The disease is usually fatal at birth, but Gelsinger had a milder form of the disease, in which the ornithine transcarbamylase gene is mutated in only part of the patient's cells, a condition known as somatic mosaicism. As his deficiency was partial, Gelsinger managed to survive on a restricted diet and special medications. Gelsinger joined a clinical trial run by the University of Pennsylvania that aimed at developing a treatment for infants born with the severe form of the disease. On September 13, 1999, Gelsinger was injected with an adenoviral vector carrying a corrected gene to test the safety of the procedure. He died four days later at the age of 18, on September 17, apparently having suffered a massive immune response triggered by the use of the viral vector to transport the gene into his cells, leading to multiple organ failure and brain death. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigation concluded that the scientists involved in the trial, including the co-investigator James Wilson (Director of the Institute for Human Gene Therapy), broke several rules of conduct: *Inclusion of Gelsinger as a substitute for another volunteer who dropped out, despite Gelsinger's having high ammonia levels that should have led to his exclusion from the trial. *Failure by the university to report that two patients had experienced serious side effects from the gene therapy. *Failure to disclose, in the informed- consent documentation, the deaths of monkeys given a similar treatment. The University of Pennsylvania later issued a rebuttal, but the university and Children's National Medical Center each agreed to pay more than $500,000 to the government.

The first book in the series, Fearless, was published in 1999 through Simon Pulse and concluded in 2004 with the 36th entry, Gone. A spinoff series, Fearless FBI was launched in 2005. The first book in the primary series, Fearless, was named one of YALSA's \\"Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers\\" for 2001. The series takes place in the 1990s and focuses on Gaia Moore, a seventeen-year-old girl who is incapable of feeling fear. Fearless focuses predominantly on Gaia's interactions and relationships with the people around her, as well as her search for an explanation for her condition and her struggle to feel like a normal teenager. The series is told primarily in three story arcs, each of which has its own primary antagonist, and concludes with Gaia graduating from high school.  Backstory  Gaia has had past strife in her family as a result of a love triangle between Gaia's mother (Katia) and the twin siblings Tom and Oliver Moore. Katia ultimately rejected Oliver and he then became obsessed with her. Katia eventually married Tom, but on the night of the wedding Oliver pretended to be Tom and raped Katia. She eventually conceived Gaia with Tom, only for Oliver to believe that Gaia is his daughter. This is later revealed to be untrue, as Oliver had become sterile due to a life saving medical operation he received as a child, which also contributed to his unstable mental status. Oliver spent many years evading the CIA but was eventually caught by Katia's father, a Russian terrorist named Yuri. Yuri contained Oliver, who eventually overtook Yuri's organization and became its leader, adopting the moniker of Loki. He would later try to connect with Gaia by visiting her under the guise of being her father Tom and teaching her martial arts. This confused Gaia, who eventually rejected Oliver. Oliver's actions were eventually detected by Tom and Oliver went into hiding once again. It was during this time that Gaia began to show a lack of fear, which was eventually confirmed by CIA testing that proclaimed her genetically unable to experience fear for herself. Oliver did not re-emerge in Gaia's life until she was twelve, when he tried to assassinate Tom but instead killed Katia by accident. This spurred Tom to essentially abandon Gaia in hopes of sparing her from Oliver's attentions, which would embitter her towards her father and cause her to become emotionally withdrawn and antisocial. Gaia spent the remainder of her childhood in several abusive foster homes. Story arcs =First story arc= The first story arc shows Oliver \\"Loki\\" Moore (the leader of a Russian terrorist organization), trying to regain Gaia's trust due to his mistaken belief that she is his daughter. He uses several extreme methods to get close to her and issues commands for his agents to track her movements, which continues throughout the entire series. This endangers not only Gaia, but the people around her, as she has recently begun her Junior year at a New York City high school. She makes several friends, including the paraplegic Ed Fargo and the college student Sam, whom Gaia has a crush on. Her crush is made complicated by the fact Sam is dating Gaia's rival and bitter school enemy: Heather. Loki attempts to isolate Gaia by kidnapping or killing anyone close to her, which results in the kidnapping of Sam. Gaia manages to rescue Sam from Loki's operatives, but is unable to save her best friend Mary or her foster mother Ella from Loki's schemes; Mary is assassinated and Ella (a secret operative for Loki) sacrifices herself for Gaia. Heather breaks up with Sam and begins dating Ed, but dumps him shortly after her older sister Phoebe goes to rehab for anorexia nervosa. Gaia begins to date Sam, but the relationship is constantly strained by stress placed upon Sam from his college dormitory RA Josh (who works for Loki) and is later ended completely with Sam's apparent death. Things are further complicated when it is revealed that Josh is one of four clones created by Loki. One of the clones befriends and becomes infatuated with Heather, giving her a \\"fearless serum\\" created by Loki (based off research from Gaia's genome). Unexpectedly, this causes Heather to go blind. During this time Ed undergoes a surgery that corrects his paraplegia and Gaia manages to befriend Heather after rescuing her from a murder attempt. The characters of Natasha and Tatiana (a Russian mother and daughter), are introduced into the series and move in with Tom (Gaia's biological father) and Gaia. Eventually Gaia begins to date Ed and the two form a romantic and sexual relationship together, but they become distant after Ed is almost killed by an assassin - Gaia realizes anyone she gets close to is vulnerable to assault or death. Loki realizes he will never gain Gaia's full trust after she rejects his proposal to collaborate with him and inherit his criminal organization. His attempts to clone Gaia and create a successful fearless serum fail. After a deadly confrontation between the Josh clones, Loki, Tom and Gaia; Loki attempts to take the fearless serum, but falls into a coma. The story arc concludes with Tom also falling into a coma after partaking in a celebratory dinner with Gaia, Ed, Natasha and Tatiana. Tom goes missing from the hospital shortly after and is presumed to have been captured by a mysterious organization operating out of Loki's control. =Second story arc= In the second arc it is revealed that Gaia's ex-boyfriend Sam is not dead, but was held hostage for several months in Loki's terrorist compound; which has become abandoned. Upon being freed, Sam and Gaia reunite and return to the compound; in hopes of finding a clue to her missing father Tom's location. Their search leads them to rescue an old prisoner named \\"Dmitri\\". During their travel back to New York, Sam discovers that Gaia is dating Ed; which wounds him emotionally. Throughout this time several assassination attempts are made upon Gaia's life, which makes Gaia suspicious of Sam and causes her to suspect he was (brainwashed) into becoming her enemy. The assassination attempts are eventually revealed to be the work of Tatiana and Natasha; who work for an organization that is outside of Loki's control. It is revealed that the prisoner found in Loki's compound is actually Gaia's grandfather Yuri: the original leader and founder of the Russian criminal syndicate that Loki controls. Gaia's status as heir of her grandfather's criminal organization jeopardized Natasha and Tatiana's inheritance (both of which are cousins of Gaia's mother); prompting them to seek out and attempt to assassinate Gaia. Both women are eventually captured in traps set up by FBI agents, Jake (a charismatic new transfer student) and Gaia. With help from Loki (who awakened from his coma), Gaia discovers that her father is in Siberia. She leaves for Siberia with Jake and Loki. Loki's personality has greatly been changed from the coma; leaving him as a benevolent and thoughtful person with regrets for his past crimes and actions. The group eventually succeeds in not only rescuing Tom, but also capturing Yuri. The success of the operation prompts Gaia to begin a relationship with Jake, who had been romantically pursuing her throughout this arc. Gaia is left with the hope that her troubles will finally be over. =Third Story Arc= The final story arc introduces the Rodke family, a wealthy family that owns a well-known global pharmaceutical company. Gaia befriends the youngest two Rodke siblings, Liz and her twin brother Chris after they transfer to the high school. During this time a mysterious drug dealer known only by the alias \\"God\\" begins introducing a new street drug called \\"Invince\\" to the New York areas. The drug causes users to feel invincible and fearless with extreme aggression and rage. While not the same drug; it greatly resembles the one created by Oliver while he was 'Loki'. The distribution of Invince causes crime and assaults to greatly increase throughout the city. Meanwhile Gaia becomes the target of a series of attacks from unknown assailants, which her uncle Oliver and recent boyfriend Jake begin to investigate. Gaia approaches the geneticist Dr. Ulrich, an employee for Rodke Pharmaceuticals, with the hope of finding a cure for her fearless condition. Dr. Ulrich tells Gaia that he can cure her by way of a surgical procedure, which proves to ultimately be successful. This is confirmed when later on Gaia flees in terror from a group of Invince drug addicts instead of fighting them. Her relief and happiness at finally being \\"normal\\" leads to conflicted emotions when she discovers that the invince addicts she ran from assaulted her ex boyfriend Ed and his new girlfriend Kai; leaving them both with lifelong scars. Gaia's new fearful disposition leaves her susceptible to psychological manipulation from Skylar Rodke, the eldest brother of the Rodke's. He emotionally manipulates Gaia into staying at his apartment for several days and skipping high schoolprom, which strains her relationship with Jake. Meanwhile Sam and Heather begin to date again, as Heather has a full recovery from her blindness and regains her eyesight. Ed falls in love with Kai while remaining bitter towards Gaia about their failed relationship. Jake discovers that Chris Rodke is the mysterious drug dealer selling Invince; this in turn results in Chris issuing a city wide order for all Invince users to kill Jake. Jake barely survives an attempt on his life with assistance from Gaia. It is ultimately revealed that Chris was forced to distribute Invince illegally under his fathers orders to show military research contractors the potential military advantages and biological effects using Invince cause. It's also implied that Chris's father greatly resents him for being gay and the \\"weaker\\" sibling compared to his older brother, Skylar. The military contractors, who had expressed interest in purchasing Invince decide to end their contract after seeing data and evidence the Rodkes have amassed from the citywide Invince users. To Gaia's surprise she finds out Dr. Ulrich lied about the effectiveness of her surgery - the effects begin to wear off, leaving her in a fearless state once again. She overhears a plan that the Rodkes are going to kill and dissect her in order to examine her DNA for the source of her condition, but ultimately fails to escape Skylar and the Rodke's clutches. She's saved from certain death by the arrival of her family (Tom, Oliver) and her boyfriend Jake. Chris (who at this point has had a change of heart) appears and informs his brother that he's called the police and they are on their way to make arrests, which prompts the two rival siblings to try killing each other. In the process Chris tries to shoot Gaia, who is saved when Jake shields her: taking the bullet meant for her. As a result: Jake bleeds to death from a gunshot wound to the chest; leaving the police with plenty of evidence to arrest both Rodke brothers and their father, whom eventually confess to all the corruptions and crimes of the Rodke company. Oliver vows never to become Loki again, as he recognizes similarities in the sibling rivalry between Chris and Skyler with Tom and himself. Gaia is emotionally destroyed by Jake's death and overwhelmed from all the violence and destruction she's had to face over the years in the city. She decides to run away and leaves New York forever.  Protagonists  *Gaia Moore: The seventeen-year-old protagonist, Gaia is extremely intelligent and is heavily trained in various martial arts. She is incapable of feeling fear, which gives her more physical strength than the average person. Gaia has dated three people throughout the series, Sam, Ed, and Jake. By the series end she has graduated from high school but leaves New York after the death of her boyfriend Jake. *Tom Moore: The father of Gaia and D Moore, Tom is also the twin brother of Oliver. He is a CIA field agent that went by the codename Enigma, but previously worked as a Green Beret.

The series would have starred Rachael Leigh Cook as Gaia, who would now be a 23-year-old field agent for the FBI. The show was never aired, as producer Jerry Bruckheimer pulled the show due to various concerns and the time slot was later filled with One Tree Hill. Warren Ellis later reviewed the pilot episode and criticized it as \\"too unfocussed [sic] to make consistently engaging television, and I think it's the wrong composition of concepts to hook the young audience I assume they're playing for.\\" Spinoff In June 2005 a spinoff series entitled Fearless FBI was launched. The series describes Gaia's post-college life, where she decides to join the FBI as opposed to the CIA, the organization her father belongs to. Gaia forms a working relationship and friendship with her partner Catherine Sanders, as well as a romantic relationship with Will Taylor. The series currently only has four books and the series was left unfinished as of Naked Eye, the fourth book in the series.

It is located at the town of Fengqiao (lit. Maple Bridge), about 5 kilometers west of Suzhou's old city. Traditionally, Hanshan Temple is believed to have been founded during the Tianjian era (502‚Äì519) of the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, in the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. The current name of the monastery derives from Hanshan, the legendary monk and poet. Hanshan and his disciple Shide are said to have come to the monastery during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (627‚Äì649), where Hanshan became the abbot. The bell of Hanshan =The poem= Hanshan Temple is famed in East Asia because of the poem \\"A Night Mooring by Maple Bridge\\" (Ê•ìÊ©ãÂ§úÊ≥ä), by Tang Dynasty poet, Zhang Ji. The poem describes the melancholy scene of a dejected traveller, moored at night at Fengqiao, hearing the bells of Hanshan Temple: ÊúàËêΩÁÉèÂïºÈúúÊªøÂ§©Ôºå Ê±üÊ•ìÊºÅÁÅ´Â∞çÊÑÅÁú†„ÄÇ ÂßëËòáÂüéÂ§ñÂØíÂ±±ÂØ∫Ôºå Â§úÂçäÈêòËÅ≤Âà∞ÂÆ¢Ëàπ„ÄÇ Yu√® lu√≤ w≈´ t√≠ shuƒÅng m«én tiƒÅn, JiƒÅng fƒìng y√∫ hu«í du√¨ ch√≥u mi√°n.

It is part of the primary school curriculum in both China and Japan. The ringing of the bell at Hanshan Temple on Chinese New Year eve is a major pilgrimage and tourism event for visitors from these countries. =The bell= Two bells are currently used at Hanshan Temple, both dating from the late Qing Dynasty when the temple was last rebuilt. One was forged in China in 1906, and the other was forged in Japan at around the same time. The dedication on the bell was written by Japanese Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi. The original Tang Dynasty bell is believed by some (including It≈ç Hirobumi and modern Chinese statesman Kang Youwei) to have been taken to Japan in ancient times. These two factors have roused some nationalistic controversy among Chinese and Koreans (see, for example, this opinion). A new 108 tonne bell commissioned by Hanshan Temple and produced by a foundry in Wuhan was completed in 2007 in order to replace the hundred years old Japanese bell. The new bell is 8.5 metres high and 5.2 metres in diameter at its widest. It is engraved with 70094 Chinese characters from Lotus Sutra.

It operated a chain of stores, with 170 outlets across 14 states. It specialized in products such as shrubs, trees, accent plants, flowers, and lawn furniture. History =Frank's Market= In 1942, Frank Sherr and his nephew-in-law, Max Weinberg, opened a food market, known as Frank's Market, on the northeast side of Detroit. Known as \\"never closed and never undersold,\\" the business became profitable. The market soon began to carry Christmas trees, annuals, and other plants in addition to its mainstay of produce and other goods =Frank begins a greenhouse= In 1949, Sherr and Weinberg purchased a vacant lot across the street from the market to house the growing number of plants the market offered. According to Sherr, the greenhouse was opened after a bout with a customer that complained the price of coffee at Frank's Market was too high but then willingly purchased a potted geranium for 79¬¢. The profits on the geranium were much higher than that on the coffee. This incident led Sherr and Weinberg to notice there was to be much more money made selling flowers. Soon after, Frank's Market began selling ferns, trees, lawn chemicals, and other landscaping supplies. =Growth= The business thrived, and in 1957 the company‚Äîby then four stores strong‚Äîincorporated, becoming Frank's Nursery Sales, Inc. By 1965 Frank's owned 18 stores throughout Michigan, and its sales were $11.35 million, with a net income of $509,000. Since lawn-and-garden sales were dependent on season, the business was cyclical in nature, with highest revenues during the growing season. This led Sherr and Weinberg to devise a method to keep sales high during the winter months. In 1966, Frank's Trims, a store which only sold craft goods, opened its doors. The company's headquarters remained in Detroit, Michigan. In 1974 Frank's acquired five garden centers from the Green Giant Company. By its 25th anniversary in 1971, Frank's had 51 locations in five states, employing approximately 1200 workers. Sales had reached approximately $37.2 million with a net profit of $1.13 million. During this time, Frank Sherr was succeeded by his son, I. William Sherr, who had previously served the company as executive vice-president and treasurer. Max Weinberg continued to serve as company president. =Frank's Nursery & Crafts, Inc.= In 1980, Frank's Nursery Sales officially changed its name to Frank's Nursery & Crafts, Inc. to emphasize both the lawn-and-garden and craft sector of its operation. Sales reached $119.3 million, and 80 locations were in operation. Much of Frank's expansion into different markets can be linked to the purchase of small regional chains. In 1982, it acquired many former A&P; stores. It acquired Philadelphia-based Gaudio's in 1988. In 1983, Frank's Nursery & Crafts was purchased by General Host Corporation. General Host bought 96 percent of Frank's shares in a $19-a-share tender offer in March 1983; the value of the sale was thus approximately $42.4 million. Frank's, at that time, spanned 95 stores. Following its acquisition by General Host Corporation, Frank's used its parent company's wealth to go on an acquisition spree with the ultimate goal of becoming the first national garden center chain in the United States. Their first target was the New York-to-Washington, D.C. corridor. From 1983 to 1987, the company acquired 43 garden centers in the New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore/Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas: 39 Flower Time Centers in the NYC metro area (acquired in 1986 and merged into Frank's stores by 1989), 14 Scott's Centers in the Baltimore/Washington, D.C., metro area (1986), and 12 independent garden centers in and around Philadelphia. In addition to its acquisitions, the company was also expanding its footprint southward, with new stores in Virginia, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. By 1990, Frank's had almost 300 stores. =Christmas by Frank's= In 1990, the first three Frank's stand-alone Christmas stores, Christmas by Frank's, opened. These stores were temporary installations placed in high- volume regional malls located in trade areas where Frank's also operated conventional stores. The Christmas stores provided shoppers with a convenient store (3,000-5,000 sq ft) where they were able to purchase holiday decorations, crafts and gift-wrap without making a separate stop. Frank's was pleased with the results, and the following year, the company operated 100 of the temporary stores. Indeed, Christmas decorations and crafts had become increasingly important lines to Frank's, helping to compensate for the seasonal sales declines in gardening supplies. Sales in 1992 grew to $558 million, a seven percent increase over the previous year, yet higher costs and interest on General Host's debt caused its profits to decline, from $8.7 million in 1991 to $2.9 million in 1992. =Frank's SuperCrafts= In 1993, the company launched Frank's SuperCrafts, opening two stores in the Detroit area. Designed as \\"superstores,\\" the SuperCrafts stores encompassed of retail space, allowing for a wider selection of craft supplies and home and holiday decorations, while incorporating in-store framing shops and floral arrangement services. Moreover, the stores featured hundreds of craft project displays, giving customers creative ideas and allowing them to see firsthand completed projects. A third SuperCrafts store opened in Philadelphia in 1994, and two more followed the same year; one each in New Jersey and Chicago. =Money cuts= By 1994, in fact, General Host's headlong expansion had come to an end, as a series of new stores proved unprofitable. In January, Frank's announced the closure of 26 stores, most of which were in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and in Florida. Company officials announced that such sales and closings would save General Host $3.8 million annually; other cuts were to come in $25 million worth of inventory, all of which would help service General Host's $238 million in debt.FNC Holdings Inc. 1995 Annual Report , accessed December 3, 2006 =Bankruptcy and liquidation= In February 2001, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because it could not afford to pay its vendors. Matters were taken to bankruptcy court, where questions arose as to whether or not Frank's could avoid shutting down its retail stores. The matter was resolved, and the company was able to recover and continue full operation. In September 2004, company officials again filed for Chapter 11. The company was heavily in debt, particularly in relation to their vendors. On September 8, of that year the decision was finally made to cease the operation of each of its 170 stores. Agreements were made with Kimco Capital Liquidation Company, which allowed for closing-down sales to be held in every outlet. After the closure of Frank's, the buildings‚Äîwith a unique half outdoor, half indoor layout ‚Äî had been slow to be reoccupied in an over-built retail market.

He spent his entire life fighting his half brother King Norodom for the throne. Si Votha was a grandson of King Ang Eng (1772‚Äì1796) and a son of King Ang Duong. His biographical notes only record that he had a daughter named Neak Ang Mechas (Princess) Ang Duong Rath Votha. Si Votha had two half-brothers, Norodom and Sisowath of Cambodia, with Norodom being the king's chosen heir. Upon King Ang Duong's death, a succession struggle ensued, with Si Votha attempting to take power while his half brother Norodom was occupied with a rebellion; eventually Norodom gained the upper hand when he gained the backing of Sisowath. Rebellion When Norodom was officially crowned king in 1864 in a joint coronation ceremony supervised by the French and Siamese officials, Si Votha once again made no secret of his intention to lay claim to the Cambodian throne. Norodom's throne would have been extremely precarious without French support. Sisowath would likely have adopted the same attitude as Si Votha if the Siamese king had allowed him to leave Bangkok. Si Votha's long history of opposition to Norodom, which led him to lead a life of discomfort in the most isolated regions of the kingdom, suggests some deep personal antagonism between the two princes. During the 1870s, taking advantage of a new uprising against Norodom's authority, Si Votha swiftly returned to Cambodia from Thailand. Begging the pardon of the king of Siam for his unauthorized departure, Si Votha left Bangkok, swiftly passed through Battambang, and travelled onward to the higher region of the Mekong. He had little difficulty in quickly raising a large band of supporters and began to harry the officials loyal to King Norodom. He besieged the provincial capital at Kampong Thom and went through the turbulent province of Kampong Svai. Forces dispatched under Norodom's orders failed to apprehend him. As late as 1876, Si Votha remained in revolt, striking at an outpost of Norodom's government, and slipping back to his sanctuary among the Stiengs, one of the tribal groups on the fringes of Cambodian society. The French refused to help King Norodom put down Si Votha's revolt until the king concluded a treaty which advocated several reforms. By January 1877, the treaty was concluded and on 15 January, King Norodom proclaimed a series of reforms under the new treaty. In return, the French now bent their efforts to defeating Si Votha's uprising. Si Votha's uprising lasted until 1885-1886. It was Norodom's prestige that ultimately brought Si Votha's resistance to an end. Si Votha, lurking on the northeastern boundaries of the kingdom, was a nuisance but nothing more. After a lifetime of dissidence, Prince Si Votha died in December 1891. After the failure of his efforts in 1885-1886, his followers became fewer, dwindling to a few companions by the time he died. In the closing years of his life, Si Votha entered into hesitant and inconclusive negotiations with the French. Having grown tired of living amongst the less civilized hill tribe people in the jungle of northeastern Cambodia, Si Votha eventually submitted to the French. However, he strongly emphasized his refusal to submit to his half-brother, King Norodom. Almost totally abandoned by his followers and virtually without resources, he died on the last day of 1891. Si Votha's life of perpetual dissidence had never brought him within certain reach of toppling Norodom from the throne. Backed by the French, Norodom had always been able to resist Si Votha's uprisings, despite the latter's popular appeal or gift of oratory. Failure The French, who were attempting to expand their influence in Cambodia at the time, were pleased by Si Votha's defeat, as he had been an outspoken critic of European colonialism in the area. Si Votha became something of a figurehead for resistance against the French. Si Votha's rebellion was largely unsuccessful, however, and in 1887, Cambodia was incorporated in the French-controlled Indochinese Union. Si Votha came to symbolise the first fight against the French colonial rule in Cambodia. But his rebellion was largely born out of jealousy and animosity toward his half brother King Norodom, rather than a desire for the independence of his country from France. During his time he was never considered an independence fighter but rather a rebellious usurper of the Cambodian throne. References 1\\\\. Milton E.

It is one of nine English-language school boards in the province, having served the English-speaking community, under various names, since 1867. As a school board, CQSB's jurisdiction covers the largest territory in the province of Quebec, at . The Central Qu√©bec School Board administers 18 schools and one adult and vocational education centre. In 2012, eight of its nine secondary schools had a student population of less than 500. CQSB's largest elementary school served almost 500 students, and its smallest one served less than 60 students in 2012. History In 1997, the Quebec government abolished denominational school boards, adopting linguistic school boards instead. Born out of the Eastern Quebec Regional School Board, Greater Quebec School Board, Mauricie School Board and the Saguenay \\"P\\" School Board, it has sprouted from their denominational origins, also incorporating English- language schools from other school boards.

School board profile Enrollment is small comparatively to French- language school boards in the administrative regions where the schools are located; some remote schools have student populations of under 100; the largest schools have nearly 600 students. Because of the small number of English-speaking students in the area served by the school board, its schools are spread hundreds of kilometres apart. Some schools, as in Jonqui√®re or Valcartier, serve Canadian Forces bases; the school board also has students of the Naskapi Nation in northern Quebec under its care.

Pyrosomes are cylindrical or cone-shaped colonies up to long, made up of hundreds to thousands of individuals, known as zooids. Colonies range in size from less than one centimeter to several metres in length. They are commonly called \\"sea pickles\\". Each zooid is a few millimetres in size, but is embedded in a common gelatinous tunic that joins all of the individuals. Each zooid opens both to the inside and outside of the \\"tube\\", drawing in ocean water from the outside to its internal filtering mesh called the branchial basket, extracting the microscopic plant cells on which it feeds, and then expelling the filtered water to the inside of the cylinder of the colony. The colony is bumpy on the outside, each bump representing a single zooid, but nearly smooth, although perforated with holes for each zooid, on the inside. Pyrosomes are planktonic, which means their movements are largely controlled by currents, tides, and waves in the oceans. On a smaller scale, however, each colony can move itself slowly by the process of jet propulsion, created by the coordinated beating of cilia in the branchial baskets of all the zooids, which also create feeding currents. Pyrosomes are brightly bioluminescent, flashing a pale blue-green light that can be seen for many tens of metres. Pyrosomes are closely related to salps, and are sometimes called \\"fire salps\\". Sailors on the ocean occasionally observe calm seas containing many pyrosomes, all luminescing on a dark night. Etymology The name Pyrosoma derives from the Greek words pyro, meaning \\"fire\\", and soma, meaning \\"body\\". Bioluminescence Although many planktonic organisms are bioluminescent, pyrosome bioluminescence is unusual in its brilliance and sustained light emission, and evoked the following comment when seen by the eminent scientist Thomas Huxley at sea: > \\"I have just watched the moon set in all her glory, and looked at those > lesser moons, the beautiful Pyrosoma, shining like white-hot cylinders in > the water\\" (T.H. Huxley, 1849). Section through the wall of a pyrosome (magnified) showing a single layer of ascidiozooids: (br) branchial orifice; (at) atrial orifice; (tp) process of the test; (br s) branchial sac Pyrosomes often exhibit waves of light passing back and forth through the colony, as each individual zooid detects light and then emits light in response. Each zooid contains a pair of light organs located near the outside surface of the tunic, which are packed with luminescent organelles that may be intracellular bioluminescent bacteria. The waves of bioluminescence that move within a colony are apparently not propagated by neurons, but by a photic stimulation process. Flashing zooids not only stimulate other zooids within the colony to luminesce, but nearby colonies will also display bioluminescence in response. Colonies will luminesce in response to touch, as well as to light. Species Pyrosoma atlanticum by a tide pool in California The following species are accepted as valid by the World Register of Marine Species: *Pyrosoma aherniosum Seeliger, 1895 *Pyrosoma atlanticum P√©ron, 1804 *Pyrosoma godeauxi van Soest, 1981 *Pyrosoma ovatum Neumann, 1909 Bloom in North Pacific In 2017, pyrosomes were observed to have spread in unprecedented numbers along the Pacific coast of North America as far north as Alaska. The causes remain unknown, but one hypothesis is that this bloom may have resulted in part from unusually warm water along the coast over several preceding years. Scientists were concerned that should there be a massive die-off of the pyrosomes, it could create a huge dead zone as the decomposition of their bodies consumed much of the oxygen dissolved in the surrounding seawater.

This is sometimes misleadingly expressed as a rule that \\"silence cannot amount to acceptance\\". Later the case has been rethought, because it appeared that on the facts, acceptance was communicated by conduct (see, Brogden v Metropolitan Railway). Furthermore, in Rust v Abbey Life Assurance Co Ltd[1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 334 the Court of Appeal held that a failure by a proposed insured to reject a proffered insurance policy for seven months justified on its own an inference of acceptance.See also, GH Treitel, The Law of Contract (9th edn Sweet and Maxwell 1995) 30-32 Facts Paul Felthouse was a builder who lived in London. He wanted to buy a horse from his nephew, John Felthouse. After a letter from the nephew concerning a discussion about buying the horse, the uncle replied saying > \\"If I hear no more about him, I consider the horse mine at ¬£30.15s.\\" The nephew did not reply. He was busy at auctions on his farm in Tamworth. He told the man running the auctions, William Bindley, not to sell the horse. But by accident, Bindley did. Uncle Felthouse then sued Bindley in the tort of conversion - using someone else's property inconsistently with their rights. But for the Uncle to show the horse was his property, he had to show there was a valid contract. Bindley argued there was not, since the nephew had never communicated his acceptance of the uncle's offer. Judgment The court ruled that Felthouse did not have ownership of the horse as there was no acceptance of the contract. Acceptance must be communicated clearly and cannot be imposed due to silence of one of the parties. The uncle had no right to impose a sale through silence whereby the contract would only fail by repudiation. Though the nephew expressed interest in completing the sale there was no communication of that intention until after the horse was sold at auction on 25 February. The nephew's letter of 27 February which was submitted as evidence by Felthouse was judged to be the first instance of communication where the acceptance was communicated to the offeror(Felthouse).And by this time, the horse had already been sold. Accordingly Felthouse had no interest in the property. Willes J delivered the lead judgment. The result was affirmed in the Court of Exchequer Chamber, (1863) 7 LT 835.

Retrieved October 5, 2014. ‚ÄúJeanneret received his first radiation and chemotherapy treatments July 23, which also happened to be his 72nd birthday.‚Äù is a Canadian-born television and radio personality best known as the play-by-play announcer for the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres and its broadcast network, the Sabres Hockey Network. Having started with the team on radio during the team's second season in 1971‚Äì72, he is the longest- tenured play-by-play announcer with a single team in NHL history. He moved to television during the 1995‚Äì96 season and began doubling both television and radio play-by-play duties during the 1997‚Äì98 season. He is known as \\"RJ\\" within the Sabres organization and by close associates. Jeanneret is a Canadian-American of Swiss descent. It is often incorrectly reported that Jeanneret was born in Switzerland; he was actually born in St. Catharines, Ontario and raised in Terrace Bay, Ontario. He is known for his energetic delivery (especially during big plays and fights), colorful player nicknames, passionate goal calls, and his trademark suspenders worn on air and uncanny resemblance to late comedian Rodney Dangerfield. Jeanneret has announced every Sabres season except for the team's first. This season was announced in its entirety on radio by Ted Darling, and for seven games on television by then- unknown Dave Hodge, who the next year left to become the host of Hockey Night in Canada. Jeanneret worked alongside Jim Lorentz for over 20 years before Lorentz retired. Harry Neale, former color commentator for the Toronto Maple Leafs regional broadcasts and was a commentator on Hockey Night in Canada until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, was Jeanneret's partner through the 2011-12 season. Former Sabres enforcer Rob Ray is Jeanneret's current partner for the MSG Network and WGR, occasionally alternating with Martin Biron. Career Jeanneret is a graduate of the Midwest Broadcasting School, a Chicago-based institution that Jeanneret described as a \\"crash course\\" in broadcasting.Hoppe, Bill (November 12, 2012).

In 1963, Jeanneret took over the play-by-play of a Niagara Falls Flyers Junior A hockey game for the regular announcer, Edd Felstead, who had become sick. Jeanneret became the color analyst the following season before assuming full- time play by play radio duties in 1965. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Rick did several radio advertisements for local Niagara Falls hardware store Buildall. Jeanneret also called Buffalo Bisons (AHL) road games in 1969-70. From 1984 until 1992, he did the Sabres' play-by-play in addition to being a popular early-morning disc jockey at the now-defunct CJRN-AM in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1992, he chose to retire from CJRN and concentrate solely on the Sabres. \\"I had enough of two jobs. I finished the game, came home and had to be up by 4 a.m.,\\" he said. Jeanneret helped close the Aud on the final night of the regular season in 1996 with an emotional tribute to his colleague Ted Darling, who was the voice of the Sabres from 1970 until the worsening effects from Pick's Disease forced him to retire in the midst of the 1991‚Äì92 season. \\"I wish that standing next to me right now would be Ted Darling,\\" said Jeanneret from the ice surface in a postgame ceremony. \\"See you in September, one block in that direction,\\" said Jeanneret, pointing toward the new arena, then dubbed the Crossroads Arena and now called KeyBank Center. In 2005, Jeanneret and the Sabres released a CD that collected some of his most memorable calls. Proceeds from the CD, which was titled Roll the Highlight Film, went to charity. It was followed up in 2006 with Top Shelf (named after his signature call, \\"Top Shelf, where momma hides the cookies!\\"), a similarly themed DVD. =Later years= Due to increasing age and health concerns, Jeanneret's retirement has been long rumored and speculated. Each year since the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, however, Jeanneret has effectively agreed to \\"one more year.\\" Jeanneret's contract was extended in 2007 through the 2008‚Äì09 NHL season.Hardy's Neale to join Rick Jeanneret. WGR 550. October 2, 2007. It was further extended in 2008 through the 2009‚Äì10 season. He was back for the 2010‚Äì11 season along with Neale. During these seasons, Jeanneret did not broadcast games while the Sabres had west coast road trips and a home game against the Boston Bruins. This most recently was from December 27, 2010 through January 8, 2011. He was also off when the Sabres played the Ottawa Senators in Ottawa on January 25, 2011. During Jeanneret's vacation, his son Mark and Kevin Sylvester filled in on play-by-play from December 27, 2010 through January 8, 2011. The idea for Jeanneret to take time off during west coast road games during these seasons was that of former managing partner Larry Quinn. On May 26, 2011, the Sabres announced that Jeanneret (and Neale) would only cover home games and 10 to 15 road games for the Sabres in the 2011-12 NHL season. This was in preparation for Jeanneret's pending retirement, in which Jeanneret stated that he almost retired after the 2010-11 season, but sought the reduced schedule instead.http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/sabres-nhl/article434612.ece Studio host Kevin Sylvester was tabbed to call those road games, along with Danny Gare. Jeanneret indicated he would take up an increased workload in 2012-13, although he would stop short of a full-time broadcast. On June 27, 2012, Jeanneret announced that he would return to the broadcast booth full-time during the 2012-13 season, this time with Rob Ray serving as color commentator in addition to the bench reporter role Ray had served in for previous seasons. Jeanneret indicated it would be his last full season with the team, and the decision may have been influenced by the labor dispute that shortened the length of the season.

Although he initially sought treatment in his native Canada due to Canada's universal single-payer health care system, he later sought American treatment (coincidentally, from the same doctor that also treated Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly) due to his stronger personal attachment with the United States after four decades of work in the country. On November 7, 2014 Jeanneret announced that following a CAT scan he was clear of cancer.http://video.sabres.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=665399 He returned to broadcasting Sabres games eight days later on Saturday, November 15, calling the first period of the game against the Maple Leafs. In April 2018, Jeanneret said that he was leaning toward returning for the 2018-19 season, but he was not certain because of his age and possible health complications (in addition to the cancer battle, he also had a pacemaker installed). Jeanneret appeared in a commercial for Molson Canadian, giving a call for a pick-up pond hockey game. Jeanneret is the play-by-play announcer for ICE's Super Chexx arcade machines. On December 22, 2018, during the third period in a home game against the Anaheim Ducks, Jeanneret suffered an acute medical emergency and abruptly cut out of the broadcast, leaving color commentator Rob Ray and on-site studio host Brian Duff to call play-by-play for the remainder of the game. Almost immediately, fans watching the broadcast or listening to the game took to the Sabres' Twitter page, expressing worry and concern for Jeanneret and asking for updates. Eyewitnesses noticed Jeanneret being escorted out of the arena on a stretcher.

The Sabres Showdown  On April 9, 2001, as part of a promotion on radio station WNSA (at the time the Sabres' flagship station), Jeanneret called a fictional game known as the \\"Sabres Showdown.\\" The fictional matchup was simulated on the NHL 2001 video game, and was said to be a matchup between the 1974‚Äì75 Buffalo Sabres and the 1998‚Äì99 Sabres, both of whom had been to the Stanley Cup finals. The game was said to have taken place at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, classic Sabres audio clips were played during intermission, and WNSA purposely held out any regular game staff from the commentary who had actually played on the 1974‚Äì75 team so as to make it seem as if they were actually playing the game. (For instance, color commentator Jim Lorentz was replaced by Mike Robitaille, who played for the Sabres in 1974‚Äì75 but had been traded before the playoffs, and WNSA hosts filled in other positions.) The 1975 team won the game thanks to Gilbert Perreault's game winning shootout goal. In all actuality, many of the members of the 1974‚Äì75 squad are still together, working for the Sabres organization and playing occasionally for the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team.

() is an Italian public research university located in Rome, Italy, with its main campus situated in the Ostiense quarter. Founded in 1992 by the Ministry of Public Education, under the request of several professors of the Sapienza University of Rome, it was the third public university to be established in the metropolitan area of Rome. The university comprises 8 schools and 12 departments, enrolling 35,338 students and having 1,370 academic and professional staff. At present, the university offers 54 undergraduate degree programs, 75 master's degree programs, 16 doctoral schools and five PhD programs. It is the second-largest university of Rome by enrollment and one of the largest research-based institutions in the country. History The idea of founding a third university in Rome was flagged in the middle 1980s when the Ministry of Public Education formed a committee of inquiry into higher education to deal with a perceived emergency in university enrollments in Rome. After much debate, a future campus location was selected in what was a semi-industrial part of the city and it was decided that the future university be named with a number in chronological order. Roma Tre University, was formally established in 1992 under the name Terza Universit√† degli Studi di Roma (Third University of Rome). One of the milestones for Roma Tre, since its foundation, as well as a guideline for its development, was its incorporation in the surrounding area, characterised by the reclamation of old buildings and school premises, transformed into facilities for study and research. Pope Francis visited the University, Rome's youngest, on February 17, 2017.http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/it/events/event.dir.html/content/vaticanevents/it/2017/2/17/universita- romatre.html Organization and administration The Rector, the Vice Rector, the Academic Senate and the Board of Governors are the main governing bodies of the university, which are responsible for setting university policy and development strategy. The statute also provides for a University Executive Committee, the Students' Representative Council, the Council of Faculty Deans and a University Ombudsman. The Rector is the official representative of the University. As well as calling and chairing meetings of the Academic Senate, the Board of Governors and the University Executive Committee, the Rector supervises the university's teaching, scientific and service structures, and gives appropriate guidance. The Rector also acts as ombudsman for the teaching and research autonomy of academic staff. The current Rector is Prof. Mario Panizza. =International relations= Double degree agreements The University has double degree agreements with: * University of Murcia (Law) * University of Poitiers (Law) * Nova Southeastern University (Law) International agreements Roma Tre University holds a number of academic cooperation agreements with foreign universities, promoting professors, researchers and students mobility and exchange.

Schmidt in 1926. It is a variation of traditional Welsh rarebit and was one of two signature sandwiches created by chefs at the Brown Hotel shortly after its founding in 1923. It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night suppers.Kleber, John E. (I) The Kentucky Encyclopedia. UP of Kentucky. p. 443. Ingredients The Hot Brown is an open-faced sandwich of baked chicken or turkey breast and bacon, covered in creamy Mornay sauce and baked or broiled until the bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Cheddar cheese or American cheese may be added for the sauce. Alternatives for garnishes include tomatoes, mushroom slices, and, very rarely, canned peaches.Kleber, John E. (II) Encyclopedia of Louisville. (University Press of Kentucky). pg.404. Some Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay. When Fred K. Schmidt created the Hot Brown, its sliced roast turkey was a rarity, as turkey was usually reserved for holiday feasts. The original Hot Brown included the sliced turkey on an open-faced white toast sandwich, with Mornay sauce covering it, with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, completed by being oven-broiled until bubbly. Pimento and bacon strips were then added to it. After its debut, it quickly became the choice of 95% of the Brown Hotel's restaurant customers. The dish is a local specialty and favorite of the Louisville area, and is popular throughout Kentucky. It was long unavailable at its point of origin, as the Brown Hotel was shuttered from 1971 to 1985. Variations The \\"cold brown\\" is baked poultry (chicken or turkey), hard-boiled egg, lettuce, and tomato open-faced on rye bread, and covered with Thousand Island dressing. It is rarely served anymore. In St. Louis, the Prosperity Sandwich is a similar dish, with origins at the Mayfair Hotel in the 1920s. It is still served in the area today, and sometimes called a \\"hot brown\\". The Turkey Devonshire, first served in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the 1930s, has been described as being similar to the Hot Brown.Cathey, Dave (2 February 2011). Food fight: Pittsburgh, Green Bay recipes go head to head, The Oklahoman In the media On the Food Network, the Hot Brown was featured in an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay. Joe and John Castro, chefs of the Brown Hotel in Kentucky, competed and won against Flay in a cook-off. It has also been featured on episodes of the network's shows The Rachel Ray Show and Southern Fried Road Trip. On the Travel Channel, the Hot Brown has been featured on the show Taste of America with Mark DeCarlo a Louisville-themed episode of Man v. Food Nation and a 2018 episode of Food Paradise titled \\"Sandwich Heroes\\". On PBS, the Hot Brown has been featured in the documentary Sandwiches That You Will Like as well as the program The Mind of a Chef, where Chef David Chang presented his interpretation of the sandwich.

Rivero was born in 1945 in Mor√≥n, Camag√ºey, in central Cuba. In his youth, he was an ardent follower of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution. He was among the first generation of journalists to graduate after the triumph of the Revolution. From 1973-1976 he was the chief correspondent of the official Cuban press in Moscow. He also served as chairman of the pro-regime National Union of Writers and Artists (UNEAC). He was then known as \\"the Poet of the Revolution\\", and associated with the major cultural figures of communist Cuba. Dissident Work In 1989 he left the National Union of Writers and Artists. On June 2, 1991 he signed the so-called \\"letter of the 10 intellectuals\\", a petition calling for the liberation of political prisoners and the holding of democratic elections. Since then, Rivero has been an outcast in Cuban society. In 1995, he founded Cuba Press, and became active in the Cuban independent journalism movement, publishing his works in newspapers in the United States and other countries. In 1999 Rivero was awarded Columbia University's Maria Moors Cabot prize for International Journalism. The following year, he was named as one of the International Press Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past 50 years. During the Cuban government's 2003 \\"Black Spring\\" crackdown on dissidents, Rivero was charged with \\"acting against Cuban independence and attempting to divide Cuban territorial unity\\", as well as with writing \\"against the government\\", organizing \\"subversive meetings\\" at his home, and collaborating with US diplomat James Cason. Rivero was convicted and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. He spent his first 11 months in a tiny one-man cell with no windows or any contact to the outside world. The arrest and imprisonment of Rivero was later defended by Cuban writer and culture minister Abel Prieto who argued that Rivero \\"was not arrested for his views, but for receiving US funding for his collaboration with a country that has besieged our island.\\" Rivero has asserted, in prison interrogations as well as in public, that all funds received consisted of fees for his articles, paid by the publishing media, not by governments or political organizations. His account of his life and his treatment by the Cuban government is given in his book \\"Proof of Contact\\".Proof of Contact: An Account of life in Cuba by Raul Rivero (2004) In November 2004 he was released following international pressure on Cuba and subsequently relocated to Spain, and was awarded the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

She was the daughter of Sirras of Lyncestis, Upper Macedonia. Eurydice had four children: Alexander II, Perdiccas III, Philip II, all of whom would be crowned kings, a daughter Eurynoe, and through her son Philip, she was the paternal grandmother of Alexander the Great. Literary, inscriptional and archaeological evidence indicates that she played an important public role in Macedonian life and acted aggressively in the political arena. Eurydice's political activities mark a turning point in Macedonian history. She is the first known royal woman who actively took political action and successfully exerted political influence. Early life Eurydice was born between 410-404 BC, most probably in 407 BC.Elias Kapetanopoulos - Sirras She was the daughter of the Lyncestian noble Sirras, who is sometimes referred as of Lyncestian, and the Lyncestian Arrhabaeus was her maternal grandfather. Queen of Macedon King Amyntas III of Macedon married the young princess Eurydice in about 390 BC, probably in an effort to secure peace allies against the Illyrians, after he was defeated by them in 393 BC. Ten years later king Amyntas III was forced to entrust a portion of his kingdom to the Greek Chalcidians, who refused to relinquish it, and by 382 BC had extended their control westward, including Macedon‚Äôs capital Pella. Sparta, the most powerful of the Greek states at that time, intervened and restored Amyntas to his capital in 379 BC, but Macedonia had to accept subservience to Sparta. Amyntas had another wife, a fellow kinswoman named Gygaea, who had three children. At some point during her husband's reign, Eurydice became the dominant wife. Still it cannot be determined whether this development was immediate or gradual, linked with her family and relations, her higher status, the ages of her sons or a combination of these factors. Nevertheless, for the first time events in the life of a royal woman were also central to the political arena of Macedonia in that period and Eurydice was, however, the most important factor in the change. Eurydice was literate, although she learned to read rather late in life,Plutarch Moralia 14 b-c probably due to being part of a culture that still was heavily oral in nature and where literacy was not fundamental to knowledge, even more in the case of those who had the wealth and leisure to be read to. Career Her life career is full of controversy. According to the Roman historian Justin, Eurydice conspired with her son-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros to kill Amyntas, then marry Ptolemy, and then give the throne to her lover. But the queen's daughter, Eurynoe, foiled the plot by revealing it to her father, Amyntas, who, nevertheless, spared Eurydice from punishment because of their common children. Eventually in 370/369 BC, Amyntas III died, and his eldest son, Alexander II succeeded him. In 368 BC, Ptolemy of Aloros killed Alexander II, despite an earlier settlement between them, worked out by Pelopidas, a Theban statesman and general. Then Ptolemy was forced by Pelopidas to agree merely to be regent for Alexander's two younger brothers, Perdiccas III and Philip II. Later on Eurydice married Ptolemy.Aeschines - On the Embassy 2.29 It is unlikely that Eurydice voluntarily married her eldest son's murderer, most probably she acted to ensure the succession of her remaining sons. A new pretender of the throne, Pausanias was very popular and was attracting support in Macedonia. Queen Eurydice asked the Athenian general Iphicrates (their father's adoptive son) to protect the throne for her two sons. Iphicrates drove out Pausanias. There is no evidence that Ptolemy had any role in this matter, or suggests that anyone other than Eurydice would have influenced Iphicrates. Even if she was prompted by Ptolemy, her successful intervention in political and military affairs remains remarkably bold and without any known precedent, an extraordinary act for a royal woman. Eurydice took the unprecedented step of seeking international help when she believed the succession of her remaining sons was in jeopardy and her attempt was successful. In 365 BC Perdiccas III avenged his brother's murder by murdering Ptolemy and taking the throne. This caused a stir amongst the families of Macedon, which called in Pelopidas to re-establish peace. As part of the peace settlement, Philip II was taken as a hostage to Thebes. Perdiccas reigned until 359 BC, and already weakened by struggles against Athens, he confronted the Illyrian ruler Bardylis and died along with 4000 of his men in a disastrous battle. Eventually his youngest brother Philip II took control of the kingdom. Personal life Eurydice was also very active in the cult activities. She may have funded the construction of the temple of Eucleia cult at Vergina. She had made a dedication polietisi (œÄŒøŒªŒπŒµœÑŒπœÉŒπ) to or for women citizens, and perhaps to the Muses, grateful for her acquired education. Archaeological findings The Philippeion at Olympia, Greece, where once the statues of Eurydice I and her family were placed Eurydice's portrait-statue, together with those of her most celebrated son Philip II, Philip II's wife, Olympias, her grandson, Alexander the Great, and her husband, Amyntas III, were realized by the Athenian statuary and sculptor Leochares in ivory and gold. They were placed in the Philippeion, a circular building in the Altis at Olympia, erected by Philip II of Macedon in celebration of his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC). Eurydice's tomb was found and identified by the Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos in 1987 in Vergina (ancient Aigai), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with other royal Macedonian tombs. In the summer of 2001, between August 13 and September 9 the tomb of Eurydice was robbed and seven marble figurines had been taken. Eurydice's tomb had faced robbery and was partially plundered since antiquity, probably soon after queen's burial, but the looters had probably failed in their mission, as evidenced by two skeletons found there. An inscribed pot fragment, dating 344/3 BC was found inside the tomb, whereas two inscriptions, one of which dated in 340 BC, have been found in Vergina of Eurydika daughter of Sirras to goddess Eukleia.SEG 33:556 Ancestry and plot disputes Plutarch explicitly states that Eurydice was an Illyrian,Mor. 14 B-C =Plutarque, Oeuv. Mor. (text and translation by J. Sirinelli, I (1), Paris 1987) 63 and 155, n. 3 (under page 63). Cf. also Hammond (n. 8) 16, n. 1 so does Libanius and thus is stated in the massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopaedia, Suda. From the modern scholars and historians, Eugene N. Borza, A. B. Bosworth and Kate Mortensen support an Illyrian ancestry, whereas Robert Malcolm Errington and Charles F. Edson dispute an Illyrian origin and favour a Lyncestian ancestry for her. In an inductive analysis of the historical information over Sirras, through an a posteriori argument, Elias Kapetanopoulos, a Greek historian, also says that Sirras must have been a Lyncestian, not an Illyrian, as Eurydice as well. Ian Worthington makes a convincing case for her Lyncestian ancestry, stating that while some dispute her ethnicity thinking her father Sirrhas may have been an Illyrian, \\"However, this is unlikely in light of a comment that Attalus made at the wedding of Philip in 337, intended as a slur on Alexander's legitimacy, for his mother was from Epirus.\\". And Ian Worthington reasons further that \\"Attalus' taunt, incidentally, goes some way to determining whether Philip's mother Eurydice was Lyncestian or Illyrian. If she had been the latter, then Attalus' remark would, by implication, make Philip also \\"illegitimate\\"...Hence Philip's mother was probably Lyncestian\\". Others also argue on her possible Lyncestian origin, stating that \\"she might have been descendent from a branch of the Bacchiadae clan, originally of Corinth.\\" Stories of Eurydice's plots against her husband and her sons are at odds with other historical evidence and may be fabricated. Recent scholars have noted the many implausibilities in Justin‚Äôs narrative and have acknowledged Eurydice's near-contemporary evidences of Aeschines towards her. Aeschines described Eurydice I as the loyal defender of her sons,Aeschines - On the Embassy 2.32 whereas a Plutarch‚Äôs passage describes Eurydice as a good model in the education of children.

Stadium history Originally built in 1951 as Capilano Stadium, it was renamed Nat Bailey Stadium in 1978 to honour the work of Vancouver restaurateur (and founder of the White Spot restaurant chain) Nat Bailey after his death to honour his tireless effort to promote baseball in Vancouver. Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium is located on the eastern side of Queen Elizabeth Park in the Riley Park-Little Mountain neighbourhood of Vancouver. The stadium was first home to the Vancouver Capilanos in the early 1950s and later attracted the Oakland Oaks, who became the Vancouver Mounties of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, from 1956 to 1962, and 1965 through 1969. The PCL returned to Vancouver in 1978 with the Vancouver Canadians, owned by Harry Ornest. He purchased most of the primary assets of Sick's Stadium in Seattle and shipped them north for use at Nat Bailey. The Canadians stayed in Vancouver through the 1999 season, then relocated south to Sacramento, California. The following season, a second incarnation of the Canadians began playing in the short-season Class A Northwest League. The stadium's capacity is 6,500. The Canadians ownership signed a long term lease at Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium in February 2007. They have significantly improved and modernized the stadium while also restoring parts of the park to their original 1951 condition. The addition of Bud Kerr Baseball Museum followed in 2008. The stadium was used as the home of the fictional Santa Barbara Seabirds Class A Minor League Baseball team in the \\"Dead Man's Curveball\\" episode of the television series Psych. It was also used as the home of the fictional Seacouver Chiefs in the \\"Manhunt\\" episode of Highlander: The Series. It's also the setting for a scene between MacGyver and Reggie Jackson in the MacGyver episode \\"Squeeze Play\\".

Biography =Early life= Born in West Barnstable, Massachusetts, Percival left his Cape Cod home at thirteen to work as a cabin boy on a Boston coaster. He moved to the merchant service, became a second mate, and while at Lisbon, he was impressed by the Royal Navy. First sent to under Lord Jervis, he soon received an assignment to a prize crew on a captured Spanish merchantman. Benefiting from lax discipline, Percival led an uprising and escaped to the American merchant ship Washington. Again impressment interrupted his homeward journey‚Äîthis time by the Dutch Navy. Managing to escape a second time, once home, he decided to enter the U.S. Navy in 1799. Subsequently, he served in the Quasi-War with France as a master's mate and midshipman. He was discharged in the demobilization of 1801 and went back to the merchant service. Percival married Maria Pinkerton of Trenton, New Jersey in 1809. The couple did not have children although they informally adopted a relative, Maria Weeks. =War of 1812= In 1809, he returned to the U.S. Navy as a sailing master, assigned to at the Norfolk Navy Yard. After a leave, he moved to the New York yard under Commodore Jacob Lewis. Placed in command of Gunboat No. 6, he engaged in several skirmishes with British forces plaguing American shipping. As a stratagem, Percival borrowed the fishing smack Yankee on the Fourth of July in 1813, using it to capture the unsuspecting , the tender of the 74-gun . Percival joined on 9 March 1814 and made three cruises during which the ship sloop captured nineteen merchantmen and two warships, and the East India Company armed brig , 12 percent of the total taken by the U.S. Navy during the war.Ellis, James H. Luminaries of Early West Barnstable: The Stories of a Cape Cod Village (Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2014), p. 97. For his gallantry in the capture of HMS Epervier, he was promoted to lieutenant and presented with a special sword by Congress, shown in the accompanying portrait from about 1860. =Mid-career= After the war, the Navy assigned Percival to the Boston Navy Yard. Within weeks, he reported for duty on . The captain's clerk, Charles J. Deblois, noted \\"Lt. P. carries a taught hand, ... He goes by the name of Mad Jack.\\"Journal of Charles J. Deblois, Captain's Clerk aboard the USS Macedonian, 1818‚Äì19, n.p., n.d., National Archives, Microfilm Publication M876 This is the earliest record of Percival's colorful nickname. Apparently tracing to his intense command style, the application of monikers to military and naval officers was common to the time. After a cruise to South America, he returned to serve as executive office at the Boston yard. In late 1823, he transferred to the frigate on the Pacific station under Commodore Isaac Hull. The two New Englanders were close associates and friends throughout their careers. Hull considered Percival \\"the best sailor I ever saw!\\"Stevens, Benjamin F. Isaac Hull and American Frigate Constitution (Boston: Bostonian Society, 1890), p. 17 In 1826, Hull put him in command of and directed him to the far reaches of the uncharted Pacific to track down the mutineers of the Nantucket whaleship . In the Mulgrave Islands, he recovered two innocent crewmen, the only survivors of the ill-fated whaler. The culprits behind the mutiny had killed one another or were dispatched by natives. Mad Jack returned by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), the first American naval ship to visit the place. His stay proved controversial and provided fodder for writers over the years. American missionaries clashed with the naval officer who challenged their sway over the local civil authorities. Under growing pressure from visiting merchant and whaling crews, the authorities rescinded a missionary-advocated ban on young women swimming out to the visiting vessels. The missionaries blamed their loss of influence on Percival. Their forceful complaints to Washington compelled Percival to eventually ask for a court of inquiry to clear his name. The court absolved him of wrongdoing, while to this day, United States destroyer squadrons based at Pearl Harbor celebrate Mad Jack Percival Day each May 11, the date Dolphin left the islands in 1826. Percival next commanded the U.S. schooner on an 1830‚Äì1831 cruise against the troublesome West Indian pirates. While on leave in 1832, the department notified him of his promotion to Master Commandant effective in March 1831. After, in 1834‚Äì1835, he had the U.S. sloop-of-war on the Brazil station. In 1836, once again, he took over as executive officer in Boston. While assigned this duty, Percival displayed his concern for the welfare of the common sailor. A group of seamen transferring from the Brooklyn yard to Boston were injured, four of them seriously, when their train derailed along the way. The four received a total settlement of $12,862. Percival volunteered to administer a trust set up in behalf of the men. He did so over several years with prudence and faithfulness, paying out every cent to the beneficiaries or their survivors. The extensive and detailed record of Percival's careful and honest handling of the matter can be found in his papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society. (This relatively insignificant episode warrants this brief mention, because a careless writer, relying on insufficient research, wrongly charged that Percival absconded with the funds. From time to time, the misrepresentation is repeated.) In 1838, he received command of the second-class ship sloop and headed to the Mediterranean to again serve under Hull. A principal ancillary duty involved educating and training young midshipman. Percival undertook the task with zeal and passion. Prominent men and fellow officers with midshipmen sons commonly asked for their youngster to be placed under the stern tutelage of Mad Jack. The young men did not always appreciate it at the time, but many went on to notable careers. As one example, Gustavus V. Fox chafed under Percival's disciplined approach on the cruise, but went on to become Lincoln's assistant secretary of the navy. Others distinguished themselves in combat. John L. Worden, a Cyane midshipman, became an admiral and is remembered as a hero of the Battle of Hampton Roads. One of the most irksome midshipmen on the cruise, nonetheless, recognized an appreciated their skipper. Henry A. Wise summarized the almost universal feeling in the service when he noted: \\"There is not a better sailor in the world than Cap. Percival or a man of better judgement in the qualities requisite for a Seaman. ... One would suppose from his impatient & passionate temper, that in case of danger he would lose all command of himself. On the contrary no one is cooler or more able to fulfill the duties of his station. To give the devil his due‚ÄîI would rather trust my life to his charge in case of emergency at Sea than any other man in the United States Navy.\\"Private Journal of Henry A. Wise, U.S.N. on the USS Cyane, n.p.,n.d., in NA, RG 45 Percival left Cyane late in 1839 due to poor health. While waiting for an assignment, he received promotion to captain in September 1841, the highest U.S. Navy rank at the time. =Circumnavigation voyage= He began the most memorable chapter of his life in November 1843. The frigate presented a major concern to the department. In disrepair, the venerable old ship served as a mere receiving (barracks) ship at Norfolk. Naval Constructor Foster Rhodes figured it would cost $70,000 to fit her out for sea. But the department did not have the money. Acting Secretary David Henshaw, from Massachusetts, knew about Mad Jack's reputation for seamanship and frugality. He told Percival to take a look. Percival reported he could do the work for $10,000. Despite widespread doubts about Percival's findings, Henshaw gave him the task. By mid-January 1844 Percival informed the secretary he \\"unhesitatingly\\" determined the ship ready for \\"a two or even a three year cruise.\\" And he was prepared to stake \\"his life and reputation\\" on his assessment.Percival to Henshaw, 16 January 1844, Letters Received by the Secretary of the Navy from Captains, 1805‚Äì61, 1866‚Äì85, National Archives, Microfilm Publication M125. Accordingly, Henshaw told the captain to get his ship ready for sea. Percival found it necessary to sail to New York to complete his 447-man crew. Percival's orders directed him to carry the first U.S. ambassador to Brazil, proceed to the east coast of Africa and on to the China seas, making his best way back to the United States. He left New York at the end of May 1844. Before the voyage ended in Boston 495 days later, the ship sailed 52,370.5 miles, circumnavigating the globe for the only time in her illustrious career. A number of members of the crew kept detailed journals of the cruise, and one officer even sketched entertaining watercolors of scenes and incidents along the way. Added to official correspondence, the result is a well-documented trip. One episode stands out above all others. In early May 1845, the ship anchored in Touron Bay, Cochin China (now Vietnam). On the second day, Percival received a note from a French missionary, Bishop Dominique Lefevere, saying the local authorities had him under arrest and condemned him to death. Within an hour, Mad Jack led 80 well-armed men ashore. Percival left a letter for the king of Cochin China demanding the bishop's release. To make his point, he returned to the ship with three mandarins held as hostages. The next day, Percival pressed the issue by capturing three junks belonging to the king, and moved his warship closer to the local forts. On the following day, the prize junks attempted to escape, but were recovered after a brief skirmish. Percival, as well as the Cochin Chinese themselves, denied the gunplay resulted in any casualties. Nonetheless, a rumor of fatalities continued into the 20th century when the confrontation became known as the first armed intervention by a Western nation against present-day Vietnam. In any event, a short while later Lefevere gained his freedom and the French credited the American effort for saving his life. King Louis Philippe intended to reward officers and crew. But political turmoil interfered. Since the king \\"took a hurried journey from his capital, ... no recognition of their services was ever received by the American tars.\\" Their compensation went \\"over the walls of the Tuileries gardens\\" as Louis Philippe escaped to London.Stevens, Benjamin F. A Cruise on the Constitution. (New York, 1904), p. 58. =Later life= After Constitution returned from her voyage in October 1845, Captain Percival went on leave and was placed on \\"waiting orders\\" status. In 1855, when Percival was 76 years old, the Navy Department placed him on the newly created \\"Reserve List\\", a forerunner of the Retired List. Although Percival was alive during the first year of the American Civil War, he took no part in it. In his last years, Percival gave silver cups to a few people close to him. One, given to the son of his attorney, offered a brief summary of his career. As well as anything, the inscription explains the man. Percival wrote: \\"This Cup, with the Donor, has made three cruises to the Pacific, one to the Mediterranean, one to the , two to the West Indies, and once around the world, a distance of about 150,000 miles. Has been 37 years in service and has never refused duty.\\"Westcott, Allan, Captain Mad Jack Percival U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings 61 (March 1935), p. 319. Some years ago, a private collector found the cup in a London flea market, and it was sold for $10,000 in a 2016 Cape Cod auction. Often described as colorful, Mad Jack attracted the attention of famed authors such as Hawthorne, Melville, and Michener. Melville, in fact, patterned his fictional character Lieutenant Mad Jack after his acquaintance, Percival. In the end, Percival's legendary status is enhanced by the fact his first naval ship, HMS Victory and his last, USS Constitution, the oldest commissioned warship and the oldest commissioned warship afloat, remain national shrines for their respective nations. Death Captain Percival died at the age of 83 on 7 September 1862 in Dorchester, Massachusetts and is buried near his birthplace in West Barnstable's Ancient Cemetery.

Within its small grid of streets is the 13th-century church of Chipstead which has been, since time immemorial, its ecclesiastical parish. Hooley is connected via paths and the A23 road to the larger community of Coulsdon, to the north, in the London Borough of Croydon. History Hooley until the early 20th century was a sparsely inhabited hamlet of Chipstead, both a largely permeable chalk upland area with little housing or industry.'Parishes: Chipstead', in A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), pp. 189-196 http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/surrey/vol3/pp189-196 Accessed 20 March 2015. Both the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the South Eastern Railway recognised the construction of short tunnels here as the best route out of London to Brighton for their rival railway lines. The two very deep railway cuttings here have been the locations of many land slips over the years.See RAIB Hooley Rail Accident Investigation Branch report of 10th December 2014 Before these the 1805 extension of the Surrey Iron Railway, a horse-drawn plateway came through this pass. A bridge from this early plateway survives at the junction of Brighton Road with Dean Lane. In 1965, upon the formation of Greater London, Hooley, along with Purley and Coulsdon, became part of the London Borough of Croydon. Some communities on the very edge of Greater London were allowed the option of returning to their former counties. Hooley voted to return to Surrey and was added to Banstead.See Hansard 17Dec1968 Vol 775 In the same way, Farleigh, which was also then in Croydon, voted to leave and was added to Godstone. Geography and amenities The land equates to part of a western slope and a narrow pass which is the lowest road crossing point of the North Downs east of Westhumble/Mickleham in Mid-Surrey and west of Otford in Kent and avoids the height of the escarpment and steep south sides at neighbouring Reigate and Caterham. Hooley consists of houses on either side of the Brighton Road plus some land to the west and is about half a mile south of the boundary of the London Borough of Croydon and about 2 miles south of Coulsdon. The village has two petrol stations, a few shops, a newsagent, a village hall, a social club and bar, and a coffee shop. The settlement is today distinct from Chipstead which is to the north west -- St Margaret's the parish church of Chipstead, is in Hooley at the junction of Star and Church Lanes - (). To the east, about a mile by a relatively steep, curved road, the early 21st century village of Netherne-on-the-Hill has established its own identity (in the former parish) on the site of the Victorian Netherne asylum for mentally ill people, expected to be completed by the 2020s. A large proportion of the secondary age children of Hooley attend Sutton Grammar School, in nearby Sutton. The M23 motorway also terminates at Hooley, converting to a mixture of a single carriageway with verges and trees and a dual carriageway.

In 1969, Spain returned the region of Ifni to Morocco.ICJ internal database refers to this case simply as \\"Western Sahara\\" (International Court of Justice Western Sahara , General List No. 61, (1974-1975)) Background Morocco gained independence in 1956, and the Istiqlal Party presented its vision for the new state's boundaries. These nationalists appealed to the idea of a Greater Morocco, based upon the territory of the Sharifian empire which preceded French and British colonization. This area included what was at the time Spanish Sahara, French West Africa, and French Algeria. The Moroccan state itself formally adopted the 'Greater Morocco' vision under Mohammed V in 1958. After Mauritanian and Algerian independence in the early 1960s, Morocco released claim to most of Greater Morocco. However, it has maintained its irredentist claim over Western Sahara. During the 1960s, Morocco succeeded in getting Spanish Sahara to be listed on the list of territories to be decolonized, and on 20 December 1966, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2229 called on Spain to hold a referendum on self-determination in the territory. After initially resisting all claims by Morocco and Mauritania (which also started laying claims to parts of the region), Spain announced on 20 August 1974 that a referendum on self-determination would be held in the first six months of 1975 and took a census of the territory to assess the voting population . Morocco declared it cannot accept a referendum which would include an option for independence and renewed its demands for the integration of the remaining provinces of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro to the country's sovereignty . In Mauritania, a smaller movement claimed some of the territory, partitioning it with Morocco . Algeria‚ÄìMorocco relations had been strained since Algeria's independence in 1962, culminating in the Sand war, and a lack of normalized relations . Algeria, after initially supporting Morocco and Mauritania in their demands , started in 1975 to support the independence of the territory. Algeria officially supported the right of self-determination of the people of the former Spanish colony, as it had supported the right of self-determination of the peoples of the rest of the African colonized countries. The Polisario Front, created in 1973, engaged in several attacks against Spanish garrisons and patrols, and also attacked the Fosbucraa conveyor belt, which exported the rich local phosphates to the El Marsa port. On 17 September 1974, King Hassan II announced his intention to bring the issue to the ICJ . In December, Spain agreed to delay the referendum pending the opinion of the court. They gave their support to ICJ submission on the grounds that it be a non-binding, advisory opinion, rather than a \\"contentious issue\\", where the ruling would oblige the interested states to act in a particular manner . On 13 December, the United Nations General Assembly voted on a submission, resulting in UN General Assembly Resolution 3292, affirming it and defining the wording of the questions to be submitted. Algeria was among the nations voting in favor, and several Third World nations abstained. Submission UN General Assembly Resolution 3292 requested that the International Court give an advisory opinion on the following questions: And, should the majority opinion be \\"no\\", the following would be addressed: In the meantime, Morocco and Mauritania jointly agreed to not contest the issue of partition or sovereignty. On 16 January 1975, Spain officially announced the suspension of the referendum plan, pending the opinion of the court. From 12-19 May, a small investigative team made of citizens from Cuba, Iran, and C√¥te d'Ivoire was sent into the region to assess public support for independence. They also performed inquiries in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Spain. In the summer, the questions were submitted by King Hassan II and Spain. Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Spain were all given permission to present evidence at the hearings (the Polisario was locked out as only internationally recognized states have a right to speak - Algeria largely represented the Sahrawis). Twenty-seven sessions were held in June and July before the Court called the proceedings final. The arguments presented by Morocco and Mauritania were essentially similar: that either one had a sovereign right over the territory. In the case of Morocco, the kingdom of Morocco claimed the allegiance of a variety of tribes in surrounding territory. In the case of Mauritania, there was no clearly defined state that existed at the time. Instead, Mauritania argued that a similar entity existed which they called \\"bilad Chinguetti\\". Spain argued against Moroccan sovereignty, citing the relationship that Spanish explorers and colonizers had established with the sultan, none of which ever recognized his authority over the region. Algeria also defended the position that the Sahrawis were a distinct people, and not under the subjection of Morocco or Mauritania. The opinion On 15 October, a UN visiting mission sent by the General Assembly to tour the region and investigate the political situation published its findings, showing that the Sahrawi population were \\"overwhelmingly\\" in favor of independence from both Spain and Morocco/Mauritania. These findings were submitted to the Court, who published their opinion the next day. For the former question, the Court decided by a vote of 13 to three that the court could make a decision on the matter, and unanimously voted that at the time of colonization (defined as 28 November 1884), the territory was not terra nullius (that is, the territory, did belong to someone). For the latter question, the Court decided by a vote of 14 to two that it would decide. It was of the opinion, by 14 votes to two, that there were legal ties of allegiance between this territory and the Kingdom of Morocco. Furthermore, it was of opinion, by 15 votes to one, that there were legal ties between this territory and the \\"Mauritanian entity\\". However, the Court defined the nature of these legal ties in the penultimate paragraph of its opinion, and declared that neither legal tie implied sovereignty or rightful ownership over the territory. These legal ties also did not apply to \\"self-determination through the free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples of the Territory.\\" (ICJ Reports (1975) p. 68, para. 162) Results The opinion of the Court was interpreted differently by the different parties, and each focused on what it sees as supporting its claims. While Morocco and Mauritania found in the answers to the two questions a recognition that their claims are legitimate and historically based, Algeria and the Polisario Front focused on the penultimate paragraph that stated that the court's decision was not to hinder the application of self-determination through the ongoing Spanish referendum. King Hassan II declared the organisation of a peaceful march to force Spain to start negotiations on the status of the territory, to which Spain finally agreed. A round of talks between Spain, Morocco and Mauritania were held in Madrid and culminated in a tripartite agreement, becoming known as the Madrid Accords On 16 November 1975, where Spain formally ceded the administration of the northern two thirds of the territory to Morocco, while the southern third was to be administrated by Mauritania. Algeria protested against the agreement, and president Boumedienne retaliated by expelling all Moroccans living in Algeria. The text of the Madrid Accords have never been made public. In consequence, the Court's decisions were largely disregarded by the interested parties. On 31 October 1975 the first Moroccan troops invaded Western Sahara from the north-east. Algeria sent its troops into the territory of Western Sahara to help in the logistic of the evacuation of the Sahrawi refugees who have been bombarded by Moroccan air forces, which led to the first and last direct military confrontation between units of the Moroccan armed forces and the Algerian national army in the First Battle of Amgala (1976). The Algerian army suffered hundreds of deaths and more than a hundred soldiers were made prisoners by the Moroccan army. Diplomatic intervention from Saudi Arabia and Egypt prevented the situation from escalating further. Spain's last soldier left the territory on 26 February 1976 . The next day, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic was declared by Polisario Front representatives. Morocco intensified its military presence in the region, and by the end of the year, Mauritania and Morocco had partitioned the territory. Mauritania was too weak militarily and economically to compete against Polisario, though, and was forced to renounce its claims in 1979. Morocco immediately annexed that territory. Morocco has continued to administer most of Western Sahara, but its sovereignty has not been recognized by the UN or any country in the world. At the same time, 82 governments have recognized the Sahrawi Republic as the legitimate government of Western Sahara.

He is especially renowned for his last-to-first victory in the latter event, and remains the only horse to have ever won both cups. Kiwi raced from 1980 to 1987, and died in 1995 at the age of 18. Background Kiwi was bred by Brian Fischer in Parore, New Zealand. He was bought by Waverley sheep farmer Snow Lupton and his wife Ann, for NZ$1000. They had previously owned a Blarney Kiss horse and therefore wanted another, with Ann's personal preference for it to have a chestnut hair coat. Racing career Though Kiwi showed promise as a racehorse, Lupton believed the horse would show strength as a distance runner. He proved this when Kiwi won the Wellington Cup from the rear of the field in a close finish. The Wellington Cup is held in late January each year, and the Melbourne Cup in November. Even to this day, Kiwi is the only horse to have won both the Wellington Cup and Melbourne Cup consecutively. This historical feat is highly regarded, especially as the Melbourne Cup is esteemed as the premier staying race in Australia and New Zealand. When entered for the Melbourne Cup, despite having won over a 3200-metre distance, Kiwi was considered very much an outsider and started with odds of 10/1. As usual, Kiwi (ridden by jockey Jim Cassidy) settled at the very back of the 24-horse field. At the turn of the Flemington track, with 500 metres remaining, Kiwi was second to last (ahead of Amarant, which was running lame). With a storming run through the field, Kiwi won the race by just over a length. The speed of his race caused many race commentators to only mention Kiwi as he neared the finish line...\\"and here comes Kiwi out of the blue\\". Kiwi's victory has become one of the most memorable performances in the history of the Melbourne Cup, especially as it illustrated a classic stayer's victory. On winning the race, Kiwi became a household sporting hero in New Zealand, forming a key example of the underdog winning against the odds. It showed that a simple trainer, when equipped with a good horse, could win the greatest prize.http://muir.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/10179/734/1/2whole.pdf (p 287) As incredible as it may seem for a champion horse, Lupton openly admitted that Kiwi was used to \\"round up the sheep\\" as part of his conditioning routine.http://www.letsgohorseracing.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=310:all- you-need-to-know-for-a-melbourne-cup-carnival-visit&catid;=40:september- december&Itemid;=65 Kiwi entered the 1984 Melbourne Cup, but was controversially scratched due to a veterinary check. Lupton always maintained that Kiwi was fit for the race and could have won. The event sparked criticism of the scratching as a potential act of bad sportsmanship, due to the rivalry between New Zealand and Australia. Kiwi also ran in the 1985 Melbourne Cup, running fifth. In 1986, he once again looked to repeat his 1983 \\"come-from- behind\\" victory, but pulled up lame close to the finish line. Later that year, he represented New Zealand in the Japan Cup, running a creditable fifth. Retirement After his run in Japan, Kiwi was retired to the Luptons' farm, where he died and was buried in 1995. The headstone simply states: \\"Kiwi, 1983 Melbourne Cup\\". A plaque commemorating Kiwi is also located at the Waverley Racecourse. Honorific eponym In 2012, Australian rail operator CFCL Australia named locomotive CF4406 \\"Kiwi\\" after the horse.

Near the turn of the century N√©zi√®re had a big interest in automobiles, and when he was enlisted for his years national service in 1899 he had to assist in building a car that could carry a Maxim gun for large scale manoeuvres, later on he would try to build his own airplane which caused him serious financial difficulties before working for a large private telephone company. At the outbreak of World War I, he was recalled to serve his country and joined 11 Company as a corporal which was part of 84 Division, sadly he was killed by machine gun fire on 9 October 1914 in the forest of Mouchy, ten miles from Arras, leaving behind a wife and two children.

These are primarily used to ensure that the relative orientation of the patient and the treatment machine are correct. The BEV image will typically contain the images of the patient's anatomy and the beam modifiers (such as jaws or Multi-Leaf Collimators (or MLCs)). Generation of Beam's Eye Views * Physical Construction: ** BEV's can be generated by exposing a high energy film (similar to photographic film) or an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) with the treatment beam itself after it passes through the patient and any beam modifiers (such as blocks). Although this type of image is an excellent indication of the basic quality of the treatment plan, the quality of film images can be poor. ** A BEV can be created using a radiation therapy simulator which mimics the treatment geometry (couch angle, gantry angle, etc.) using an X-ray source instead of the higher energy treatment source. The jaws and blocks can be imaged on the same film as the patient's landmarks. * Artificial Reconstruction: The BEV can be created using a Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph (or DRR) that is created from a computed tomography (or CT) data set. This image would contain the same treatment plan information, but the patient image is reconstructed from the CT image data using a physics model. References * Faiz Kahn and Roger Potish (Eds.)

He resided in both Shepherd Market, London and Cornwall. His Spanish partner Ra√∫l Bal√≠n died in 2004. Childhood Raleigh Trevelyan was born in the Andaman Islands. India to Colonel Walter Raleigh Fetherstonhaugh Trevelyan, commander of the British Indian Army garrison at the penal settlement of Port Blair, and Olive Beatrice Frost Trevelyan. The family moved to Punjab, and then when he was six, the family trekked on horseback for three weeks to his father's new assignment in Gilgit, where Colonel Trevelyan was posted as military adviser to the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. At the age of eight, like many children of the British Raj, Raleigh was packed off to a boarding prep school in England and rarely saw his parents after that. Professional life and works After leaving Winchester College in 1942, Trevelyan served in the Second World War in the Rifle Brigade and was sent first to Algiers and then to Italy. On 23 May 1944, during the breakout from Anzio, the Green Howards battalion to which he was attached lost 230 men, some of whose deaths he blamed on himself. Towards the end of 1944, back with the Rifle Brigade, Trevelyan got a job in the British military mission in Rome, where he remained for two years, falling in love with central Italy. His participation in the bloody Battle of Anzio, in which he was wounded twice, was the subject of two memoirs. The Fortress: A Diary of Anzio and After (1957), was recognized for his painfully honest account of how a soldier responds to the terror of being under fire. Later, with the help of German and Italian friends, Trevelyan wrote Rome ‚Äô44: The Battle for the Eternal City (1981), which provided a vivid account of what it had been like for soldiers and civilians on the other side of the conflict. After the war Trevelyan worked briefly in merchant banking, then became an editor at William Collins, Sons and later at Jonathan Cape and Michael Joseph, editing both fiction and nonfiction while writing his own books. Among Trevelyan's early popular books were several about Italy, including Princes Under the Volcano (1973), an account of the British role in Sicily in the 19th and 20th centuries; and The Shadow of Vesuvius (1976), about the discovery of the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the 18th century. A 1978 book, A Pre-Raphaelite Circle, viewed the major painters of the early Victorian avant- garde movement of the title through the prism of correspondence he found in the papers of Pauline Trevelyan, a distant relation by marriage who was a confidante and patron of the art critic and artist John Ruskin. The Golden Oriole (1987) combined a journal of Trevelyan's five journeys to the subcontinent with historical chronicle, genealogy, family photographs, memoirs and interviews, to trace his family's involvement across 200 years of British involvement in India. Notable were Sir William Macnaghten, the British Resident in Kabul whose beheading during the First Anglo-Afghan War prompted the 1842 retreat from Kabul and the Massacre of Elphinstone's Army and the ten Trevelyans who were among the hundreds of Britons massacred during the Siege of Cawnpore in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Others ancestors discussed in the chronicle include Thomas Babington Macaulay who introduced English-medium education in India; Charles Trevelyan, reformer of the British Civil Service and later Governor of Madras and Indian Finance Minister; George Otto Trevelyan, the author of the classic, The Competition Wallah (1865); Humphrey Trevelyan, a British diplomat who became one of Jawaharlal Nehru's closest and most valued associates during the final preparations for Indian Independence; and, of course, his own parents. Trevelyan spent ten years retracing Walter Raleigh's footsteps for his best-known work, the acclaimed biography Sir Walter Raleigh (2002). The volume argued for the elevation of his distant ancestor and namesake to the upper reaches of the pantheon of British greats, based on Raleigh's achievements as an explorer, courtier, poet, American colonizer and early purveyor of tobacco to England and potatoes to Ireland. The book waded deep into the nuances of British, French and Spanish foreign policy to explain Raleigh's various acts of naval heroism and piracy; verified Raleigh's claims about silver and gold deposits in The Guianas (thought at the time to be wild fabrications); and brought Elizabethan court intrigues into focus to trace the events that led to Raleigh's years in the Tower of London and his beheading for treason in 1618.

Overview The town of Lansingburgh was originally intended as the site for the principal city north of Albany on the east bank of the Hudson River; but the inhabitants of the settlement a mile or two south of New City (not to be confused with New City, a different city in New York known today by that name), as the village of Lansingburgh was first known, took advantage of the opportunities which presented themselves in rapid succession, and the prestige which in the natural order of things should have gone to Lansingburgh went to Troy, which rapidly outran its rival in the race for commercial supremacy in Rensselaer County. The town of Lansingburgh is located on the western border of the county, north of the city of Troy and south of the town of Schaghticoke. On the east lie the towns of Pittstown and Brunswick and on the west the Hudson River, separating Lansingburgh from the northern part of Albany county and the southern part of Saratoga county. The site of the county was originally included in parts of two separate patents. The northern part of the town as at present constituted was set off from Schaghticoke in 1819 and forms a part of the Schaghtic√≥ke tract, occupied by the Schaghticoke Indians and set off to them in 1670. This territory afterward became the property of the city of Albany and was sold in 1707 to the Knickerbocker colony. The southern part of the town formed a part of the Stone Arabia patent.  Early history  Soon after the Dutch began to make settlements in the vicinity of what is now Troy, Robert Saunders, a resident of Albany, was attracted to the level and fertile tract now in the town of Lansingburgh, and called by the Indians Tascamcatick, and the woodland to the south called Passquassick. September 1, 1670, Francis Lovelace, governor of the province of New York, granted the former tract to Saunders. March 22, 1679, Sir Edmund Andros, another governor, granted to Saunders the woodland, together with the small island in the Hudson called Whale island, since submerged by the construction of the State dam south of it. September 19, 1681, Saunders sold part of the woodland south of Piscawen kill to Peter Van Woggelum. May 26, 1683, Saunders sold the remaining portion of his patent, Tascamcatick, to Joannes Wendell, and the latter afterward purchased another piece of woodland which extended northward along the river to a creek called by the Indians Paensick kill. Wendell's land was confirmed to him July 22, 1686, by a patent granted by Governor Thomas Dongan and called Steene (Stony) Arabia patent, and for over a century the territory was known as Stone Arabia. June 21, 1763, Robert Wendell, a descendant and heir of Joannes Wendell, sold to Abraham Jacob Lansing, for 300 pounds, that portion of his property beginning opposite the middle branch of the Mohawk River and running thence eastward as far as the limits of the Stone Arabia patent, excepting that portion which had been sold to Simon Van Antwerp but then owned by William Rogers. A deed given by Stephen Van Rensselaer (one of the patroons) to Abraham Jacob Lansing, dated July 13, 1769, described the north bounds of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck and the south bounds of the Stone Arabia patent. The number of settlers increased rapidly and Lansing, believing that his property would soon form the site of a thriving village, in 1771 had a portion of it surveyed and laid out into lots, with streets and alleys, by Joseph Blanchard, which he called Lansingburgh. The map showed 288 lots, and the ground it covered included that bounded by North, East and South streets and the Hudson River. On January 1, 1771, the inhabitants of the settlement agreed upon a compact called the \\"Proposals,\\" for the government of the community, and chose civil officers. It was provided that there be annually elected a committee of five persons, a \\"town clerk, a path-master, and three Fence Viewers, \\"and that Abraham Jacob Lansing, or his heirs forever, should be one of the committee; At the first town meeting Ebenezer Marvin was elected moderator and Thomas S. Diamond clerk. The first committee comprised Abraham Jacob Lansing, Isaac Bogart, John Barber, Ebenezer Marvin, and Benjamin French. Abraham Wendell was chosen pathmaster, and Robert Wendell, Levinus Lansing, and Isaac Van Arnum fenceviewers. The advantageous location of the new \\"City of Lansingburgh\\" attracted many persons from other localities, particularly from New England, and the embryo village grew rapidly. Small manufacturing establishments were started and mercantile and commercial houses were founded at a rate that gave great promise. In 1774 a school was founded by Maus R. Van Vranka, who also agreed to read one English and one Dutch - sermon on every Sunday in the' year, excepting four Sundays reserved for himself. 1775-1800 When the inhabitants of Lansingburgh became aware of the fact that the relations between the American colonists and Great Britain had become strained almost to the point of rupture, they showed their patriotism by subscribing to a paper which read as follows, dated June 15, 1775: A General Association agreed to and subscribed by the Freemen Freeholders and Inhabitants of Lansingburgh and Patent of Stone Arabia. That these men meant all that they said and promised is evidenced in the fact that, with very few exceptions, their names are found enrolled upon the following lists of militia maintained during the War of the Revolution. Some of the names are those of persons then residing outside the bounds of the town, but there is no record distinguishing them from residents of Lansingburgh. The first Masonic lodge in Lansingburgh was Hiram lodge No. 35, F. & A. M., which was instituted upon a warrant granted August 16, 1787. The growth of New City, as Lansingburgh was commonly called in contradistinction to the Old City (Albany), and the development of its various industries were so great that May 21, 1787, \\"Claxton & Babcock in King street between Hoosick and South Streets,\\" in answer to what they believed to be a demand for a local newspaper, brought out the first issue of the first newspaper published in Lansingburgh-the Northern Centinel and Lansingborough Advertiser. It was a weekly publication and the first newspaper printed within the limits of the territory now known as Rensselaer county. Strange as may seem, it did not contain a line of local news except the publishers' announcement to the public. Its contents consisted of several columns of European \\"news\\" three months old, a few brief items regarding events which had occurred nearly a month before in New York, Boston and Philadelphia, some miscellany and five advertisements. The publication at once became popular and circulated through a large territory north and east of Lansingburgh. The name \\"Lansingborough,\\" which appeared in the caption of the paper, was an error of the printers, but was not changed to Lansingburgh for several months. At the time of the establishment of the Centinel every inhabitant of Lansingburgh expected that the village was destined to become a large and prosperous city. New buildings were erected on all sides and the demand for residences and stores could not be supplied at times. Not infrequently persons who came here to locate were compelled to go elsewhere temporarily. The transportation business between this and other points had grown to large proportions, and sailing craft of all descriptions came up to the southern part of the village, where they deposited their burdens and departed with new cargoes. The expectations of the founder of Lansingburgh were more than met in its rapid development. In 1790, so numerous had become the population and so varied the business interests of the community, that it was deemed advisable to establish a more substantial form of government than the \\"Proposals\\" first agreed to. Consequently, April 5, 1790, the State Legislature passed an act to appoint trustees to take and hold certain lands therein mentioned, and for other purposes. Soon after a fire company was organized, and in 1791 the hand fire engine known as old No. 1 was purchased in Philadelphia. Abraham Jacob Lansingh; founder of Lansingburgh, died October 9, 1791, in the seventy second year of his age. His wife, Catherine Lansing, died the day before in the sixty-ninth year of her age. In the notice of his death printed in the American Spy October 14 he is referred to as \\"the original proprietor of this town.\\" The \\"Scotch Seceders,\\" as they styled themselves, built a church in 1789 or 1790 on the ground later occupied by the brush factory of J. G. McMurray & Co. The Rev. John Gausman was pastor, but the society died out after a brief career. The first post-office in Lansingburgh was established in June 1792. Up that date letters for Lansingburgh were sent to Albany and there sent to their destination by a stage line operated by Annanias Platt upon the authority of the Legislature. Stephen Gorham was made deputy postmaster in April 1791. He was succeeded in the summer of 1792 by John Lovett, who became the first postmaster of Troy. As early as June 18, 1782, Rev. Brandt Schuyler Lupton preached in Lansingburgh, but he did not become the pastor of a congregation until November 3, 1758, being ordained on the third Sunday of that month as pastor of the Reformed Protestant Dutch church. The first church edifice was erected on the north- west corner of Richard and John streets and was used as a house of worship until 1832. The congregation continued in existence until the close of the 18th century. August 9, 1792, the First Presbyterian church was organized and the cornerstone of the building subsequently used by the congregation as a house of worship was laid July 5, 1793, by Rev. Jonas Coe, pastor of the united congregations of Lansingburgh and Troy.1 The church was dedicated the following year. It was built on the north end of the village green and its walks were made of brick imported from Holland by Levinus Lansing, which he originally intended to use in the construction of a residence for himself. The Lansingburgh library was opened September 9, 1794, with William Bell as librarian. The library was incorporated by an act of the Legislature February 24, 1795. February 10, 1795, the Legislature passed a law providing for. the paving of certain streets. in Lansingburgh and appointing John D. Dickinson, James Dole, Jonas Morgan, Annanias Platt, Nicholas Schuyler, John Keating and Benjamin Tibbits commissioners to direct the work of improvement. The streets directed to be paved were King street, leading from what was called South street to Richard Street; North street, leading from Queen street to Water street; and Hoosick street, leading from Queen street to Water street. The first water works in Lansingburgh of which any information is in existence were constructed prior to or during 1795. In December of that year water was supplied to all persons desiring it, from aqueducts constructed and maintained by Luther Emes & Co. The Lansingburgh academy was chartered by the Regents of the University February 20, 1796, in response to a petition signed December 24, 1795, by influential residents of the village. The law erecting the village of Lansingburgh was soon found to be incomplete, uncertain and restricted. Provision was also made for the election of three assessors, a collector, treasurer and \\"as many fire wardens as the trustees for the time being or the major part thereof may order and direct.\\" The duties of the village officers were carefully defined. March 30, 1798, by act of the Legislature, Alexander I. Turner and Adonijah Skinner were given the exclusive right, for five years beginning May 1, 1798, to conduct a stage line between the village of Lansingburgh and the town of Hampton, Washington county, passing through the towns of Hebron, Salem and Granville. The Lansingburgh Gazette made its initial appearance September 18, 1798, Gardiner Tracy being its first publisher. Before that time, in addition to the Northern Centinel and Lansingburgh Advertiser, the Federal Herald, the American Spy and the Northern Budget had been started.  1800-1810  In the reports of cases adjudicated in the Supreme Court of Judicature of the State of New York is recorded the decision in the case of Van Rensselaer against Dole, a unique proceeding for damages on account of alleged slander. The decision in the case was handed down in April 1800, and since that time at least one lawsuit of a similar nature has been decided in favor of the defendant, the decision being based upon the law as laid down by the presiding judge in the case of Van Rensselaer against Dole. The opinion and decision in the case, being so unusual, are quoted: Van Rensselaer against Dole. This was an action of slander. The declaration charging the defendant with speaking of the plaintiff and others, the following words: \\"John Keating is as damned a rascal as ever lived, and all who joined his party and the procession on the 4th of July, (meaning the said John Van Rensselaer and the party and procession, in which the said John Keating acted as captain on the said 4th of July) are a set of blackhearted highwaymen, robbers, and murderers.\\" The words were differently charged, with some additional expressions, in the other counts, but were in substance the same. Plea the general issue. The limits of the village of Lansingburgh were again defined by the Legislature April 2, 1801, as follows: Beginning at a point in the division line between the counties of Albany and Rensselaer, opposite the mouth of the creek on which John D. Van Der Heyden's mill now stands, from thence running on a line due east to the foot of the first range of hills, thence northerly on a line along the foot of the said first range of hills, until said line strikes the north bounds of the farm of Cornelius Lansing, and on which the said Cornelius Lansing now lives, thence westerly along the north bounds of said farm, to the division line between the counties of Rensselaer and Saratoga, thence along the westerly line of the said county of Rensselaer to the place of beginning. By this law, or amended charter of Lansingburgh, the inhabitants of the village were accorded additional privileges and new duties were defined for them. Provision was made for new village ordinances relative to markets, streets, drainage, fire department, liquor license and many other matters, all of which were left in the hands of the new trustees. The structure which spans the Hudson River between Lansingburgh and Waterford, Saratoga county, known as the Union bridge, is distinguished as being the oldest wooden bridge in the United States. It stands intact today as strong apparently as in the early days of the century. When the bridge was constructed it was deemed a marvel of engineering skill. How the public looked upon the structure at that time is manifested by the elaborate character of the exercises which attended its opening. The day was a holiday in Lansingburgh. A \\"very numerous procession\\" was formed at noon at Johnson & Judson's hotel and marched to the bridge, and thence across to Waterford, \\"under the discharge of seventeen cannon,\\" where a dinner had been provided at Van Schoonhoven's hotel at the expense of the stockholders of the bridge. Among the prominent persons in attendance were the governor, the secretary of state, the comptroller, \\"and a large number of respectable gentlemen from Albany and the adjacent villages,\\" who \\"partook in much harmony and conviviality.\\" The structure is long and thirty feet wide, comprising four arches, which are supported by three pillars and two abutments. It is owned by the Union Bridge company, of which Thomas A. Knickerbacker is president and John Knickerbacker treasurer. As early as 1803 Rev. Laban Clark and Martin Ruter preached to Methodist congregations in Lansingburgh. Seven years later a house of worship was erected on the bank of the river at the foot of Elizabeth street and was occupied by the congregation until 1827. The church was regularly organized July 23, 1827, and February 15, 1828, the trustees of the society bought of Derick Lane the lot on the southwest corner of North and Queen streets, where a church was afterward erected. The first regular pastor was Rev. S. D. Ferguson. The First Baptist society of Lansingburgh was organized June 11, 1803, and the first edifice was located on the corner of John and North streets.  1810‚Äì1850  During the War of 1812 an artillery company, of which Reuben King was captain and Caleb Allen lieutenant, and which had been organized before that war, was sent to Ogdensburg, but was soon afterward sent home. When the draft was ordered for the 155th Regiment, in command of General Gilbert Eddy of Pittstown, one- fourth of the artillery company was required for service, but before the regiment had proceeded further than Granville hostilities had terminated and the regiment was dismissed. When Commodore Macdonough, the distinguished commander of the flotilla on Lake Champlain, visited Lansingburgh, April 8, 1815, on his way to New York, be was welcomed by a large concourse of citizens, headed by a committee, who presented to him a pair of handsome pitchers and a dozen goblets. The pitchers were inscribed on one side: \\"Commodore T. Macdonough, with an. inferior force, captured the British squadron on Lake Champlain September 11, 1814;\\" and on the other: \\"Presented by the citizens of Lansingburgh - to the Hero of Lake Champlain.\\" The goblets were inscribed: \\"The citizens of Lansingburgh to Commodore Macdonough.\\" The gift was acknowledged in a letter from Commodore Macdonough to the citizens' committee, consisting of James Hickok, David Smith, Elias Parmelee, John Topping, Elijah Janes, Gardiner Tracy, James Adams and James Reid. The bank of Lansingburgh was incorporated March 19, 1813, beginning business at No; 531 State street, then King Street. The bank started with a capital of $200,000, of which $60,000 was paid in. Under the general banking law of 1838 reorganization was effected, and June 20, 1866, the name was changed to National Bank of Lansingburgh. March 9, 1869, it was changed back to a State bank and called- the Bank .of Lansingburgh. Its banking house was located on the northwest corner of State and Richard streets. After a career of sixty- four years the corporate existence of the Bank of Lansingburgh ceased March 19, 1877, its last president being Horace W. Day, vice-president Leonard J. Abbott, cashier Alexander Walsh, teller E. H. Leonard, and bookkeeper William C. Groesbeck. In 1819 a portion of the town of Schaghticoke was annexed to Lansingburgh, which contains the hamlet of Speigletown, in the northeastern part of the town. This hamlet received its name from the Vanderspeigle families, early settlers of the southern part of the town of Schaghticoke. Soon after Hiram lodge, F. & A. M., ceased to exist, in September, 1822, a dispensation was granted for the institution of Phoenix lodge, which was organized in the following year. A history of the lodge will be found in a separate chapter dealing with Masonry in Rensselaer' county. The First Universalist church was organized December 15, 1832, but it was not until the summer of 1834 that a small wooden house of worship was erected on the southwest corner of John and North streets. The society ceased to exist after a career of a few years and its church edifice was sold to St. John's Roman Catholic congregation. This congregation was organized in 1840 or 1841 and the church was dedicated in 1844 by Bishop McCloskey. St. Augustine's Roman Catholic church, erected in 1864 on the east side of John Street between Elizabeth and Market streets, at a cost of $40,000, was dedicated May 6, 1866, by Bishop Conroy of Albany. Rev. Thomas Galberry, O. S. A., was the first pastor. St. Augustine Free Institute was established December 13, 1869, by Rev. Thomas Galberry, Edward A. Dailey, Michael J. Collins, Ellen Wood and Mary Sullivan at the corner of John and North streets. It was afterward placed in charge of the Sisters of St. Joseph and its name was changed to St. Augustine's Free Institute. By changes made in the bounds of the town by act of the Legislature in 1838, that portion of the village known as Batestown became a part of the city of Troy. Lansingburgh was visited by its first serious fire Sunday, July 9, 1843, when nearly two entire blocks in the central part of the village were destroyed. The fire originated about 4 P. M. in the stables of the Rensselaer house and spread with great rapidity. The fire companies of Troy, Cohoes and Waterford responded to the call for assistance and their presence doubtless prevented the flames from destroying the entire village. About twenty five buildings were totally destroyed and several others damaged. The burned area was located between State and Congress streets and Elizabeth and Grove streets. Two weeks later, Sunday evening, July 23, about 10.30 o'clock, fire which originated in Jacock's barn destroyed about twelve more buildings.  1850‚Äì1900  The Rensselaer County bank was established January 1, 1853, with a capital stock of $200,000 by John S. Fake as president. It was converted into a national bank in June, 1865, but six years later it resumed its old title. It ceased to exist July 13, 1872. The 30th Regiment, N. Y. State Vols., the history of which is contained in a preceding chapter, had its inception in Lansingburgh, the first full company for that regiment being organized in this village. It was mustered into the service of the United States as Company A, with Samuel King as captain, John H. Campbell as lieutenant and Francis Dargen as ensign. At the first battle of Bull Run Captain King, Ensign Dargen and five privates were killed. Lieutenant Campbell succeeded to the captaincy. The term of service of the company and the regiment was two years from June 6, 1861. Company K, 169th Regiment, was organized by Captain Daniel Ferguson and Second Lieutenant E. R. Smith. The former was killed at the explosion of the mine at Fort Fisher. The term of service of the company was three years from October 6, 1862. Captain Charles S. Holmes and First Lieutenant Cornelius Kelleher were members of Company C, 192nd Regiment. March 48, 1875, Justice Westbrook of the Supreme Court granted an order for the appointment of John P. Albertson as secretary of the Exchange Bank of Lansingburgh, and the following afternoon, with trucks and workmen, Isaac McConihe, president of the bank, with his counsel, John H. Colby, and Mr. Albertson, came to Lansingburgh from Troy and removed the safe, books, etc., loading them on the trucks and taking them to Mr. McConihe's office in Troy. In 1882 Mrs. Deborah Powers, then ninety-three years of age, desired to devote a portion of her estate to the use of those who had been less fortunate, and she decided to found a home for aged women. April 10, 1883, she purchased the property now known as the Powers Home for Old Ladies, formerly called the Daniel Davenport homestead, which was remodeled and another story placed on both wings. The first inmate was received December 20, 1883. In 1884 the building was again enlarged. The grounds embrace a half block in the northern part of the village between Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth streets and Second and Third avenues. On the morning of Wednesday, December 11, 1895, a small house on Second avenue, just below Sixth street, was burned, the flames causing the death of Mrs. Hannah Eglin Sliter and Mary Harris, the former a well-known resident of the village.  Public Institutions  When the public school system of the State was organized by the Legislature in 1807, Charles Selden and Thomas Wallace were chosen as the first school commissioners for Lansingburgh. Under the system of supervision by town superintendents in 1834, John G. Neal was elected to that office. In 1847 the Legislature passed an act permitting school district No. 1 of Lansingburgh to raise by taxation money enough, in addition to the public money, to establish a free school. This was one year before the free school system of the State was attempted by the Legislature, and four years before the fully developed system of 1851 was established. Prof. James C. Comstock was made principal of the new free school. The Lansingburgh Academy is an old institution. The petition for its incorporation was signed December 24, 1795, by Benjamin Tibbits, William Bell and twenty-five others, and the charter was granted by the Regents February 20, 1796. The first building was erected on the site fronting the old \\"green,\\" which is now the village park. It was of wood, and in it the school was maintained for twenty-five years. A new building was erected in 1820 on the north side of Fourteenth street near Fourth avenue. In that building the school has since been maintained, and under the charter of 1796. The first principal of the academy was Chauncey Lee. Among those who received their early education at this time-honored institution were Chester A. Arthur, afterwards president of the United States; Judge John K. Porter, Thomas G. Alvord, and many others. The fire department of Lansingburgh was organized by act of the Legislature April 17, 1844, with Thomas C. Davenport as the chief engineer. This volunteer fire department came to an end December 9, 1874, when a paid department was organized in accordance with an act of the Legislature, the first chief engineer being Thomas H. Mason; first assistant, John Franklin; foreman of hose, William M. Lea; assistant foreman, Milford Osborne; superintendent of steamers, John Brooks; assistant superintendent and engineer, Frank Spotten. Upon the failure of the Bank of Lansingburgh, the only one in the village, Albert E. Powers, son of Mrs. Deborah Powers, became its receiver. In order to facilitate the liquidation, the firm of D. Powers & Son opened a bank under the title of Bank of D. Powers & Sons, the other partner being Nathaniel B. Powers,. the other son of Deborah Powers. From March, 1877, until the death of Deborah Powers May 28, 1891, the mother and sons jointly conducted the bank in connection with their oilcloth factory. The factory was established many years before by Deborah Powers and her husband, William Powers. The couple were married February 23, 1816, while Mr. Powers was teaching school in Lansingburgh. Having been successful in experiments in the manufacture of this product, Mr. Powers abandoned teaching in 1821 and devoted his time from that time on to this industry. Mrs. Powers was her husband's active helper in all his experiments, both in counsel and labor. In 1828, the building they occupied being too small for the accommodation of the work, the factory now standing on the west side of Second avenue was erected. In 1829 Mr. Powers lost his life while making varnish and Mrs. Powers was also severely burned in the same accident. But she bravely determined to carry on the business, which she did with great success to the day of her death, amassing a great fortune. In 1842 Albert E. Powers was admitted into the business as his mother's partner, and five years later Nathaniel B. Powers became a member of the firm, Jonathan E. Whipple, who had become a partner in 1832, retiring. After the death of Mrs. Powers both the oilcloth manufactory and the bank continued under the ownership of the two sons. Since the failure of the Bank of Lansingburgh many years before no State or National incorporated banking institution had existed in Lansingburgh until 1888, when, October 19, it was decided by capitalists of the village to organize a bank with a capital stock of $68, 500, to be paid on February 12, 1889, with a limit of $250,000. Subsequently the capital stock was reduced to $50,000 and these officers were elected: President, J. K. P. Pine; vice-president, Robert C. Haskell; cashier, Edward Van Schoonhoven. The bank was named the People's Bank of Lansingburgh, and the lot No. 604 Second avenue was purchased for a site for a banking building, for $2,000. Ground was broken November 2, 1889, and the bank began business in the following February. The Leonard hospital was incorporated in 1893, and the institution has since been under the direction of the State Board of Charities. The property was formerly owned by Mrs. Hugh L. Rose, who was a daughter of Dr. Leonard, and when she died she directed that the building should be devoted to the purposes of a hospital. Her wishes were fulfilled and the institution was named in honor of her father. It is located on the northeast corner of Fourteenth street and Sixth avenue, and the grounds surrounding it extend from Sixth to Seventh avenues and from Fourteenth to Fifteenth streets. The building is a two-story brick structure and well adapted to the purposes for which it is used.  Churches  Reference has been made to the establishment of the First Presbyterian church. The second church edifice was commenced in 1844 and opened for service April 25, 1845. In 1866 and 1867 a commodious chapel was erected at a cost of $8,000, and since then the church has been enlarged and remodeled at a cost of $20,000. The work was completed in the summer of 1870 and the edifice, then practically a new one, was dedicated, the sermon being preached by the Rev. An son J. Upson, D. D. The Methodist Episcopal church of Lansingburgh was organized July 23, 1827. The first house of worship was constructed at the foot of Elizabeth street near the river. A class had been formed as early as 1798, and in 1803 Rev. Laban Clark and Martin Ruter preached. In 1810 a house of worship was erected, and in 1828 and 1829 a church was built at the corner of North and Queen streets. Rev. S. D. Ferguson was the first stated pastor, though others had preceded him before the society became organized in due form. In 1848 a new church was built on the northeast corner of Elizabeth and Congress streets, which has been enlarged and remodeled. The society has always been a prosperous one. The John Street Baptist church was organized June 11, 1803, and the first church edifice was on the east side, of State street between Hoosick and Lansing streets. September 6, 1804, the work of erecting a larger and more convenient church was begun on the northwest corner of Congress and Richard streets. This building subsequently became the property of the Second Presbyterian society and was known as Olivet .church. It later was given over to secular uses. The John Street Baptist church, having labored under heavy financial difficulties, was finally dissolved in 1857 and the church edifice was sold to satisfy a mortgage. The society was reorganized July 28, 1858, with A. B. Whipple as pastor. The edifice formerly occupied by the Second Presbyterian church on John street was purchased and improved, and soon after occupied. The Second Presbyterian church, later named Olivet, was organized in 1835, as the First Free Presbyterian Society of Lansingburgh. Soon after organization had been effected a brick church was erected on the east side of John street, between Elizabeth and Richard streets. The first pastor was the Rev. Samuel P. Spear, and during his ministry the name of the organization was changed to that of the Second Presbyterian church of Lansingburgh. May 17, 1861, the congregation having been reorganized as Olivet church, it purchased the property formerly owned by the Baptist church, located on the northwest corner of Congress and Richard streets. In 1877 a chapel was erected on the northeast corner of Clinton and Congress streets. Trinity Protestant Episcopal church was organized January 5, 1804, and the first house of worship was erected on the corner of Market and John streets. The first rector was the Rev. Dr. David Butler, who served St. Paul's at Troy at the same time. The church was destroyed by fire on Christmas morning, 1868, but was rebuilt almost immediately, being ready for occupancy within two years. The new edifice cost about $60,000. The Reformed Presbyterian church of Troy and Lansingburgh was incorporated December 21, 1831, but in the following year sold its property and disbanded. The Universalist church was organized in 1833, its edifice being located on the corner of North and John streets and its first pastor being the Rev. Charles Woodhouse. The society did not prosper and ultimately sold its property to St. John's Roman Catholic church and went out of existence. St. John's church was the first Roman Catholic church to be established in Lansingburgh. Its first house of worship was the building purchased of the Universalist society, located on the corner- of North and John streets, which, after being repaired, was consecrated by Bishop McCloskey in 1844 as \\"The Catholic Church of the Village of Lansingburgh.\\" The first pastor was the Rev. W. P. Hogan. For a while it was known as St. Joseph's church. The new church was built in 1864 and given the name of St. Augustine's. The African Methodist Episcopal church was incorporated May 18, 1846, and after a career of twenty-five years it ceased to exist. The society maintained services at No. 549 Whipple avenue. The Free Methodist church was established in 1866 and its house of worship on Ann street, south of Elizabeth, was dedicated November 15, 1867. The first pastor was the Rev. George E. Ferrin. The Germondville Union church of North Lansingburgh, incorporated July 23, 1844, occupied during its career the house of worship afterwards owned by the Methodist church at Speigletown. The English Evangelical Lutheran church of the Redeemer started with four persons, John Knudsen and wife and John H. Lingenfelter and wife. During the summer of 1889 Paul Klingler, a student in the Lutheran Theological seminary at Philadelphia, Pa., spent his vacation in an effort to gather together the anglicized Lutherans living in Lansingburgh, and succeeded in gathering fifty or sixty men, women and children. The time having arrived for Mr. Klinger to return to his studies in the seminary, the little flock was left without a shepherd. In the month of October Rev. Samuel G. Finckel came from Hartleton, Pa., to organize a congregation. In December about a score of members were incorporated, bought a lot and started a church, the cornerstone of which was laid about March 1, 1890. The building was completed and opened for service in May, 1890. Among the other leading organizations in Lansingburgh, the Sans Souci Yacht club was organized October 12, 1867; the Lansingburgh Choral union was organized March 20, 1879.  Industries  The population of Lansingburgh is composed largely of persons whose business is located in Troy, but the village sustains several manufacturing concerns which contribute greatly to its wealth and prosperity. Even while Troy was yet a comparatively small village Lansingburgh enjoyed an immense trade with Vermont and Northern New York in grain, beef, pork, butter, cheese and other produce. There were many commission merchants or \\"middle-men\\" in the village. In the beginning of the 19th century there were at least a dozen warehouses on River street for storing grain. Lansingburgh was then the centre of a great grain trade, buying of the farmers for many miles around and selling at Albany, New York and other cities. About 1825, and even before that date, there were several leather tanneries in operation in the village. Frederick Forsyth, Keating Rawson, Cornelius Lansing, Asa Burt and William Guest owned the most important of these. There were also a number of slaughter and packing houses, among them being those of Ives & Wilson, Tobias Loring, Noel Atwood and Thomas Turner. Before the year 1800 there were four or five \\"ship yards\\" in town, where sailing vessels for navigation on the Hudson were made. Armington & Hawkins and John Stilson were prominent in this line. The oilcloth industry has been a prominent one for many years. Reference to the factory of D. Powers's Sons has been made in preceding pages. P. C. Davenport, Jonathan E. Whipple and Ferrin engaged in the business at an early day. Caswell's rifle factory began business about 1812 or 1813. Twentyfive men were employed for many years in the three shops. Brush manufacturing was also an early industry, David McMurray being the pioneer in the business. All of his five sons-William, John G., Robert, David and Moses-were engaged in the same business. Large numbers of persons were employed in the various works for many years. Edwin Chamberlain established a carriage factory in 1836, in Troy, removing to Lansingburgh in 1858. The business developed to large proportions and gave employment to a number of skilled workmen. The Ludlow Valve Manufacturing company, which was located for many years in Lansingburgh, made preparations in 1896 to move to Troy and occupy a part of the former plant of the Troy Steel company in the southern part of the city. The plant was originally established in Waterford, but was removed to Lansingburgh in 1872, remaining in the village for twenty-four years. One of the earliest grist mills in town was started about 1785 or 1790 by Levetsee, near the Brunswick line. There were also several other grist mills and a number of lumber mills in town. Sherrill & Hedges had a nail factory in the village, and Fisher & Co. conducted a thread factory for a few years. James McQuide began the manufacture of brushes about 1855, and eleven years later he erected a large brick building for use as a factory. Subsequently he admitted his son, Joseph McQuide, to the business under the firm name of James McQuide & Son. Sweney & Bradshaw began the manufacture of brushes in 1857. The firm afterward became Bradshaw & O'Bryan, and finally John G. O'Bryan became sole pro. prietor. The brush factory of George Scott was established in 1842. E. & C. Woods began the manufacture of brushes about 1843. The Rensselaer Valve works, now located in Cohoes, were founded in Lansingburgh in 1853 by P. Southwick. S. V. Arnold subsequently became interested in the business. In 1879 S. V. Arnold & E. L. Rowe came into possession, and not long afterward the energies of the proprietors were turned toward the manufacture of valves. The factory employs a large number of experienced workmen. Edward Tracy was the founder of the big malt house in Lansingburgh, said to be one of the largest in the country. Bilbrough's knitting mill, founded in Cohoes in 1854 as a cotton yarn factory, was removed to Lansingburgh about 1880. Cross & Hoyt established a brush factory in the village in 1833. Frederick M. Hoyt succeeded to the business in 1858. Milford L. Fancher established an insurance business about 1858. The Cold Spring ale brewery was founded early in the century by John Topping. A brush factory was started in 1874 by James Reed. About 1875 A. Faden began the manufacture of carriages and sleighs. Owen Denuin began the manufacture of brushes in 1874, and Curran & Barker entered the same line of business in 1875. The greatest modern industry in Lansingburgh is that conducted by the United Shirt & Collar company. This concern was formed by the consolidation of the houses of James K. P. Pine, S. A. House's Sons, Sanford & Robinson, Beiermeister & Spicer and Marshall & Briggs, and was incorporated May 7, 1890, with a capital of $2,000,000. July 1 of that year it began business with these officers: President, Samuel B. Sanford; vice-presidents, Frederick Beiermeister, jr., David C. Briggs; treasurer, James K. P. Pine; secretary, Edward 0. House. The manufactories which comprise this giant concern had all been in business for several years, and the new corporation became at once one of the greatest in the world. The company started with three factories-one in Lansingburgh, located on the corner of Second avenue and Twenty-first street; the Anchor factory, at Nos. 509, 511 and 513 River street, Troy, and the factory on the corner of Fifth avenue and Broadway, Troy. One of the largest manufacturing industries in Lansingburgh is that of S. Bolton's Sons, located on the west side of Second avenue in the Fourth ward. It is known as the Eagle brewery and is one of the most important ale and porter breweries of Northern New York. The firm now consists of Samuel Bolton, jr., and Joseph Bolton, brothers. Samuel Bolton, jr., is the business head while his brother attends to the practical end of the business. The establishment has gained a high reputation and its output is enormous. Employment is given to a large number of hands. Samuel Bolton, jr., is one of the prominent citizens of the village. He is interested in the banking business and his real estate holdings are large, the firm being among the largest taxpayers of the village. The business was established in 1865 by the father of the present members of the firm, who came from England. From a small beginning it has grown to its present proportions and produces for its owners large fortunes.  References  =Lansingburgh histories= *Rittner, Don. Lansingburgh.

Notable passion bearers include the brothers Boris and Gleb, Alexander Schmorell (member of the White Rose resistance movement), and the entire Imperial Family of Russia, murdered by the Bolsheviks via execution on July 17, 1918.Orthodox Church in America References Category:Types of saints Category:Groups of Eastern Orthodox saints ","title":"Passion bearer"},{"id":"2097760","text":"Stylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style, usually to written language, but it has been applied successfully to music and to fine- art paintings as well.Argamon, Shlomo, Kevin Burns, and Shlomo Dubnov, eds. The structure of style: algorithmic approaches to understanding manner and meaning. Springer Science & Business Media, 2010. Another conceptualization defines it as the linguistic discipline that applies statistical analysis to literature by evaluating the author's style using various quantitative criteria. Stylometry is often used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents. It has legal as well as academic and literary applications, ranging from the question of the authorship of Shakespeare's works to forensic linguistics. History Stylometry grew out of earlier techniques of analyzing texts for evidence of authenticity, author identity, and other questions. The modern practice of the discipline received publicity from the study of authorship problems in English Renaissance drama. Researchers and readers observed that some playwrights of the era had distinctive patterns of language preferences, and attempted to use those patterns to identify authors of uncertain or collaborative works. Early efforts were not always successful: in 1901, one researcher attempted to use John Fletcher's preference for \\"‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äôem\\", the contractional form of \\"them\\", as a marker to distinguish between Fletcher and Philip Massinger in their collaborations‚Äî- but he mistakenly employed an edition of Massinger's works in which the editor had expanded all instances of \\"‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äôem\\" to \\"them\\".Samuel Schoenbaum, Internal evidence and Elizabethan dramatic authorship; an essay in literary history and method, p. 171. The basics of stylometry were established by Polish philosopher Wincenty Lutos≈Çawski in Principes de stylom√©trie (1890). Lutos≈Çawski used this method to develop a chronology of Plato's Dialogues. The development of computers and their capacities for analyzing large quantities of data enhanced this type of effort by orders of magnitude. The great capacity of computers for data analysis, however, did not guarantee good quality output. During the early 1960s, Rev. A. Q. Morton produced a computer analysis of the fourteen Epistles of the New Testament attributed to St. Paul, which indicated that six different authors had written that body of work. A check of his method, applied to the works of James Joyce, gave the result that Ulysses, Joyce's multi-perspective, multi-style novel, was composed by five separate individuals, none of whom apparently had any part in the crafting of Joyce's first novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.Samuel Schoenbaum, Internal evidence and Elizabethan dramatic authorship; an essay in literary history and method, p. 196. In time, however, and with practice, researchers and scholars have refined their methods, to yield better results. One notable early success was the resolution of disputed authorship of twelve of The Federalist Papers by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace. While there are still questions concerning initial assumptions and methods (and, perhaps, always will be), few now dispute the basic premise that linguistic analysis of written texts can produce valuable information and insight. (Indeed, this was apparent even before the advent of computers: the successful application of a textual/linguistic analysis to the Fletcher canon by Cyrus Hoy and others yielded clear results during the late 1950s and early 1960s.) Applications Applications of stylometry include literary studies, historical studies, social studies, and many forensic cases and studies. It can also be applied to computer code and intrinsic plagiarism detection, which is to detect plagiarism based on the writing style changes within the document. Stylometry can also be used to predict whether someone is a native or non native English speaker by their typing speed. Stylometry as a method is vulnerable to the distortion of text during revision. There is also the case of the author adopting different styles in the course of his career as was demonstrated in the case of Plato, who chose different stylistic policies such as the those adopted for the early and middle dialogues addressing the Socratic problem. Current research Modern stylometry uses computers for statistical analysis, and artificial intelligence and access to the growing corpus of texts available via the Internet.Argamon, Shlomo, Jussi Karlgren, and James G.

Case studies of interest * In 1439, Lorenzo Valla showed that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery, an argument based partly on a comparison of the Latin with that used in authentic 4th-century documents. * In 1952, the Swedish priest Dick Helander was elected bishop of Str√§ngn√§s. The campaign was competitive and Helander was accused of writing a series of a hundred-some anonymous libelous letters about other candidates to the electorate of the bishopric of Str√§ngn√§s. Helander was first convicted of writing the letters and lost his position as bishop but later partially exonerated. The letters were studied using a number of stylometric measures (and also typewriter characteristics) and the various court cases and further examinations, many contracted by Helander himself during the years until his death in 1978 discussed stylometric method and its value as evidence in some detail.Text processing text analysis and generation ‚Äì text typology and attribution.

After his personal notes were made public on his 90th birthday in 2001, a study used stylostatistical methods to determine which of those talks were written by him and which were written by various aides. * In 1996, the stylometric analysis of the controversial, pseudonymously authored book Primary Colors, performed by Vassar College professor Donald FosterAuthor Unknown by Gavin McNett Salon November 2, 2000 brought the topic to the attention of a wider audience after correctly identifying the author as Joe Klein. (This case was only resolved after a handwriting analysis confirmed the authorship). * In 1996, stylometric methods were used to compare the Unabomber manifesto with letters written by one of the suspects, Theodor Kaczynski to his brother, which resulted in his apprehension and later conviction. * In April 2015, researchers using stylometry techniques identified a play, Double Falsehood, as being the work of William Shakespeare. Researchers analyzed 54 plays by Shakespeare and John Fletcher and compared average sentence length, studied the use of unusual words and quantified the complexity and psychological valence of its language. * In 2016, MacDonald P. Jackson, Emeritus Professor of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, who had spent his entire academic career analyzing authorship attribution, wrote a book titled Who Wrote \\"The Night Before Christmas\\"?: Analyzing the Clement Clarke Moore Vs. Henry Livingston Question,[20], in which he evaluates the opposing arguments and, for the first time, uses the author-attribution techniques of modern computational stylistics to examine the long-standing controversy. Jackson employs a range of tests and introduces a new one, statistical analysis of phonemes; he concludes that Livingston is the true author of the classic work. *In 2017, Simon Fuller and James O'Sullivan published a study claiming that bestselling author James Patterson does not do any writing in his co-authored novels. According to O'Sullivan, his collaboration with former U.S. president Bill Clinton, The President is Missing, is an exception to this rule. * In 2017, a group of linguists, computer scientists, and scholars analysed the authorship of Elena Ferrante. Based on a corpus created at University of Padua containing 150 novels written by 40 authors, they analyzed Ferrante's style based on seven of her novels. They were able to compare her writing style with 39 other novelists using, for example, stylo. The conclusion was the same for all of them: Domenico Starnone is the secret author of Elena Ferrante.Jacques Savoy. Elena Ferrante Unmasked. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320131096_Elena_Ferrante_Unmasked * In 2018, Mark Glickman, senior lecturer in statistics at Harvard University worked with Ryan Song, a former statistics student at Harvard, and Jason Brown, a professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, applied stylometry to find that, most likely, The Beatles' song \\"In My Life\\" was composed by John Lennon, but with a 50% chance that Paul McCartney wrote the middle eight.Peter Reuell. \\"You say John, I say Paul. But what does stylometry say?\\". https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/09/harvard-statistician-examines- beatles-mystery/ *In 2019, the ETSO project: Stylometry applied to the Spanish Golden Age Theater, directed by √Ålvaro Cu√©llar Gonz√°lez and Germ√°n Vega Garc√≠a-Luengos (University of Valladolid) managed to gather more than 1200 plays of the Spanish Golden Age. After applying stylometrical analysis, the attribution of Mujeres y criados to Lope de Vega was ratified, and an authorship problem was detected in La monja alf√©rez, a play attributed to P√©rez de Montalb√°n which, thanks to these analyzes and through historical and philology research, was eventually attributed to Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n. *In 2020, Rachel McCarthy and James O'Sullivan proved that Emily Bront√´ is the true author of Wuthering Heights, ending speculation by some critics that the novel might have been written by one of her siblings, specifically either Branwell or Charlotte. Data and methods Since stylometry has both descriptive use cases, used to characterise the content of a collection, and identificatory use cases, e.g. identifying authors or categories of texts, the methods used to analyse the data and features above range from those built to classify items into sets or to distribute items in a space of feature variation. Most methods are statistical in nature, such as cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, are typically based on philological data and features, and are fruitful application domains for modern machine learning methods. Whereas in the past, stylometry emphasized the rarest or most striking elements of a text, contemporary techniques can isolate identifying patterns even in common parts of speech. Most systems are based on lexical statistics, i.e. using the frequencies of words and terms in the text to characterise the text (or its author). In this context, unlike for information retrieval, the observed occurrence patterns of the most common words are more interesting than the topical terms which are less frequent.Biber, Douglas. Variation across speech and writing. Cambridge University Press, 1991. The primary stylometric method is the writer invariant: a property held in common by all texts, or at least all texts long enough to admit of analysis yielding statistically significant results, written by a given author. An example of a writer invariant is frequency of function words used by the writer. In one such method, the text is analyzed to find the 50 most common words. The text is then divided into 5,000 word chunks and each of the chunks is analyzed to find the frequency of those 50 words in that chunk. This generates a unique 50-number identifier for each chunk. These numbers place each chunk of text into a point in a 50-dimensional space. This 50-dimensional space is flattened into a plane using principal components analysis (PCA). This results in a display of points that correspond to an author's style. If two literary works are placed on the same plane, the resulting pattern may show if both works were by the same author or different authors. =1. Gaussian statistics= Stylometric data are distributed according to the Zipf-Mandelbrot law. The distribution is extremely spiky and leptokurtic, the reason why researchers could not use statistics to solve e.g. authorship attribution problems. Nevertheless, usage of Gaussian statistics is perfectly possible by applying data transformation.Van Droogenbroeck F.J., 'An essential rephrasing of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law to solve authorship attribution applications by Gaussian statistics' (2019) =2. Neural networks= Neural networks, a special case of statistical machine learning methods, have been used to analyze authorship of texts. Texts of undisputed authorship are used to train a neural network by processes such as backpropagation, such that training error is calculated and used to update the process to increase accuracy. Through a process akin to non-linear regression, the network gains the ability to generalize its recognition ability to new texts to which it has not yet been exposed, classifying them to a stated degree of confidence. Such techniques were applied to the long-standing claims of collaboration of Shakespeare with his contemporaries Fletcher and Christopher Marlowe, Neural Computation in Stylometry I: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Fletcher Matthews RAJ & Merriam TVN Lit Linguist Computing (1993) 8 (4): 203‚Äì209. doi: 10.1093/llc/8.4.203Neural Computation in Stylometry II: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Marlowe Merriam TVN & Matthews RAJ Lit Linguist Computing (1994) 9 (1): 1‚Äì6 and confirmed the opinion, based on more conventional scholarship, that such collaboration had indeed occurred. A 1999 study showed that a neural network program reached 70% accuracy in determining the authorship of poems it had not yet analyzed. This study from Vrije Universiteit examined identification of poems by three Dutch authors using only letter sequences such as \\"den\\". A study used deep belief networks (DBN) for authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication (CA). One problem with this method of analysis is that the network can become biased based on its training set, possibly selecting authors the network has analyzed more often. =3. Genetic algorithms= The genetic algorithm is another machine learning technique used for stylometry. This involves a method that starts with a set of rules. An example rule might be, \\"If but appears more than 1.7 times in every thousand words, then the text is author X\\". The program is presented with text and uses the rules to determine authorship. The rules are tested against a set of known texts and each rule is given a fitness score. The 50 rules with the lowest scores are not used. The remaining 50 rules are given small changes and 50 new rules are introduced. This is repeated until the evolved rules attribute the texts correctly. =4. Rare pairs= One method for identifying style is termed \\"rare pairs\\", and relies upon individual habits of collocation. The use of certain words may, for a particular author, be associated idiosyncratically with the use of other, predictable words. Authorship attribution in instant messaging The diffusion of the internet has shifted the authorship attribution attention towards online texts (web pages, blogs, etc.) electronic messages (e-mails, tweets, posts, etc.), and other types of written information that are far shorter than an average book, much less formal and more diverse in terms of expressive elements such as colors, layout, fonts, graphics, emoticons, etc. Efforts to take into account such aspects at the level of both structure and syntax were reported in. In addition, content-specific and idiosyncratic cues (e.g., topic models and grammar checking tools) were introduced to unveil deliberate stylistic choices. Standard stylometric features have been employed to categorize the content of a chat by instant messaging, or the behavior of the participants, but attempts of identifying chat participants are still few and early. Furthermore, the similarity between spoken conversations and chat interactions has been neglected while being a major difference between chat data and any other type of written information.

It predated the creation of political parties as they are understood today. The Young New Zealand Party was generally reformist in outlook, and would probably be considered left-wing in modern terms. It had connections to the labour movement (particularly miners), to small farmers, and to small businessmen. It was contrasted with another reformist faction, led by Julius Vogel, Robert Stout, and John Ballance. This group pursued a more academic type of reform, focused around socially liberal causes such as women's suffrage and MƒÅori rights. Both groups were originally part of a government led by George Grey, but fractured after Grey's government was defeated. Key figures in the Young New Zealand Party were William Montgomery (the de facto leader), Richard Seddon, James McGowan, John McKenzie, Joseph Ward and William Hall-Jones. The group had no formal organisation, and had no membership or structure outside Parliament. Later, many of members of the Young New Zealand Party would, along with members of the other reformist faction, establish the Liberal Party.

Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie (1755) records Frederic Louis Norden's extensive documentation and drawings of his voyage through Egypt in 1737‚Äì38. It contains some of the very first realistic drawings of Egyptian monuments and to this day remains a primary source for the looks of Egyptian monuments before widespread 19th and 20th-century tourism and excavations. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, under the order of Frederick V of Denmark, first published the book in 1755. Norden had already done some preliminary work, but got entangled in war-service for England and died in France 1742 of tuberculosis before anything was ready. He left his documents and drawings to his friend. Mark Tuscher from Nuremberg made the drawings into copperplates for the publication. Norden published some test drawings from his voyage in 1741, under the long name Drawings of Some Ruins and Colossal Statues at Thebes in Egypt, with an account of the same in a letter to the Royal Society. A very often-used extract from this book is Norden's drawing of the Great Sphinx of Giza. As the first near-realistic drawing of the sphinx, he is the earliest known to draw the Sphinx with the nose missing. Although Richard Pococke in the same year visits and later publishes a stylish rendering (in A Description of the East and Some other Countries, 1743), he draws it with the nose still on. Pococke's drawing is a faithful adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698 (Voyage to the Levant, 1702, English trans.), featuring only minor changes. It is highly unlikely if the nose was still on that Norden out of free fantasy would leave it out. This drawing is often used to disprove the story that Napoleon I of France destroyed the nose of the Sphinx.

She was born and raised in Rye, New York, the daughter of concert singer Elizabeth Poole-Jones and classical pianist, Frank Sheridan. While best known for her role as Jerry's mother in Seinfeld, her decades-long career is extensive and includes work as a dancer, singer, and actress of stage and screen. While best known for her role in Seinfeld, her decades-long career is extensive and includes work as a dancer, singer, and actress of stage and screen. Career Sheridan began her professional life in New York City and the Caribbean as a nightclub dancer and singer, moving on to stage work. She was cast in Broadway productions throughout the 1970s, both in musicals and plays. Sheridan co- starred with Meryl Streep and Christopher Lloyd in the 1977's musical, Happy End, before moving to Los Angeles. Working in Hollywood, she came to prominence in supporting roles in over a dozen feature films and 60 prime time network television movies, mini-series, and series including Kojak, Archie Bunker's Place, St. Elsewhere, Newhart, Moonlighting, The A-Team, Who's the Boss, Hill St. Blues, Cagney & Lacey, Family Ties, and Murder, She Wrote. Her first major role was playing nosy neighbor Raquel Ochmonek on the NBC TV series ALF, from 1986 to 1990. Following that she secured her most renowned and long-lived role, as Jerry's mother, Helen, in Seinfeld. She appeared in all nine seasons, from 1990 to 1998. In the 1950s and 1960s, she lived and worked in the Caribbean, \\"singing and playing the piano in almost every bar and saloon in the West Indies.\\" In the late 1960s, back in New York, she performed in one of Julius Monk's annual cabaret reviews at Plaza 9, located in the Plaza Hotel. In 2009, with Andy Griffith and Doris Roberts, Sheridan co-starred in the feature film Play the Game, a romantic comedy about a lonely, widowed grandfather who, after a 60-year hiatus, learns dating tricks from his serial romancer of a grandson. The film stirred up controversy due to its octogenarian sex scene between Sheridan and Griffith. Personal life While working as a dancer in New York City nightclubs, Sheridan met the then- unknown James Dean. She wrote a book, Dizzy & Jimmy: My Life with James Dean: A Love Story, chronicling their time together in 1952. In it, she describes them as each other's first romantic love. \\"We had great times... We didn't want to be apart. We found a place and lived together... [b]efore he really hit it big.\\" Dean pursued work on the stage in New York, with film roles in Hollywood soon to follow. Without sure footing or a serious plan, forging a future was not an option, thus bringing about the end of their relationship. \\"He was being hauled away into this career, and I couldn't follow him,\\" she said in an interview. Early in 1953, Sheridan departed New York for the Virgin Islands. She lived for over a decade in St. Thomas and later Puerto Rico. She earned a living as a dancer and also by singing and playing piano. Together with a neighbor who had a dance troupe, she won a dance contest she choreographed for the first Carnival in St. Thomas. She also earned a six hundred dollar purse finishing first in a horse race, atop her stallion, General√©. After a brief engagement to a man, Justus Villa (aka Pancho), she realized she didn't want to marry him, broke it off, and returned, for a time, to New York City. There, at a party, she again met up with Dean. Afterwards, in a cab, he told her, \\"Nothing's lost between us. It never will be. You're a part of me and I'm a part of you. I take you with me wherever I go.\\" That was the last time she saw him. Back in the Caribbean, in Puerto Rico, she met jazz musician [William] Dale Wales (1917‚Äì2003) in Puerto Rico. They shared a life from 1960 until his death; they wed in 1985. Their daughter is a photographer living in New York City's Greenwich Village.

It grew out of the Te Aute Students Association, established by former students of Te Aute College in 1897. It was established as the Young MƒÅori Party in 1909. While the Young MƒÅori Party had political intentions, it did not function as a political party as they are generally understood. The Young MƒÅori Party's members either acted as independents or joined an existing party, such as the New Zealand Liberal Party. In most respects, the Young MƒÅori Party is best understood as a club or association, not a united electoral bloc. Anthropologist and author Toon Van Meijl said of the group \\"the Young Maori Party's programme generated a basic division within Maori society between a relatively small educated elite and a predominantly illiterate mass of poor people\\". Membership The membership of the Young MƒÅori Party consisted primarily of younger MƒÅori who had received a European- style education. Many were from the East Coast or the Bay of Plenty. Prominent members included James Carroll, Paraire Tomoana, ƒÄpirana Ngata, Te Rangi Hƒ´roa (who was a founding member), and Maui Pomare. The most important concern of the group was the improvement of MƒÅori health and welfare. Most members of the Party believed that in order to prosper, MƒÅori needed to adopt European ways of life, particularly Western medicine and education. At times, especially earlier in their careers, they offended older and more traditional MƒÅori by attempting to abolish traditional practices. Later they developed more sensitivity and tended to present Western ways as similar to pre-European traditions. Ngata in particular also realised that MƒÅori culture was in danger of being corrupted or swamped by European culture, and encouraged the revival of many MƒÅori arts and crafts, such as kapa haka and carving. He also recorded many waiata and other forms of MƒÅori literature, ensuring its preservation. Loss of members As it was a group of like-minded politicians rather than a true party, the Young MƒÅori Party did not survive the retirement, defeat and deaths of its members. Hiroa left parliament in 1914, and by 1930 Carroll and Pomare had both died. Ngata remained in parliament until 1943, when he was defeated by Labour-Ratana candidate Tiaki Omana. New MƒÅori The Party was widely admired by Pakeha, who saw their programmes as advancing the Maori race, and by contemporary MƒÅori, who benefitted from their initiatives and admired their ability to work within Pakeha systems. From the 1970s, however, a new generation of activist MƒÅori began to see the Young MƒÅori Party as 'sell outs' who had swallowed the myth of European cultural superiority. They believed that the Party was mistaken in believing that if MƒÅori adopted European ways, they would be treated as equals. Recently this perception has been revised by historians such as Ranginui Walker and James Belich, who emphasise the achievements of the Party, especially Ngata, and stress that their strategy of co-operation was effective in the context of its time.

Mouse is an American surreal humour and psychological thriller adult animated television series created by Matt Maiellaro for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. The series revolves around Mouse Fitzgerald, nicknamed \\"Fitz\\" (voiced by Maiellaro), an alcoholic mouse who performs odd jobs so he can buy more beer. Together with his chinchilla companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world. In producing the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost- cutting measure; the series is animated by Radical Axis. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot but established a serial format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme. The pilot episode for 12 oz. Mouse, \\"Hired\\", premiered on June 19, 2005. The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim's lineup on October 23 of that year and originally ended on December 17, 2006. A stand-alone webisode was released online on May 16, 2007. Critical reception was polarized; some praised the series' experimental nature, while others felt confounded by it. In 2018 a double-length special, entitled \\"Invictus\\", aired on October 14th and it was announced that 12 oz. Mouse was also revived as a series. The third season, consisting of 11 episodes, premiered on July 20 and ended on July 31, 2020.12 oz. Mouse season 3 episode list from TV Guide. The ending credits of both \\"Invictus\\" and the season 3 episodes feature a song by Amaranthe. Premise The series' main characters, Skillet (left) and Mouse Fitzgerald (right) The show revolves around a mouse named Mouse Fitzgerald (voiced by Matt Maiellaro), nicknamed \\"Fitz\\", who is fond of beer and caught in a world of espionage, love, and the delights of odd jobs. The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from absurdist comedy to include mystery and thriller elements. Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world. Fitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of \\"\\" pills beneath the city, and Shark (Adam Reed), Clock, and Rectangular Businessman's (Kurt Soccolich) attempt to control the nature of time and reality. Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor (Matt Harrigan), Roostre (Scott Luallen), Stoned Peanut Cop (Nick Weidenfeld) and others as they engage in gun battles, blow things up, and try to understand cryptic hints. The show also sometimes contains surreal \\"subliminal\\" images that flash across the screen during key plot moments, including skulls, mustached snake beasts and people screaming. The series concludes with the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the Shadowy Figure. He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, in their true forms outside the simulation, when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber. They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved ‚Äì Golden Joe says \\"I thought this was done,\\" to which Fitz replies, \\"I thought so too. I guess we're not.\\" One webisode was made in 2007, showing Fitz and his friends escaping the city to live in a desert. Golden Joe is carried away by birds, while later one night, Peanut Cop mysteriously disappears. Fitz and Skillet later meet a woman, Lee, who turns out to be a werewolf. Their fate at the end of the episode was unknown. In 2018, a half- hour special episode aired, which continued the story. Fitz, now with a mustache and suffering from amnesia, is shown to be living in a new city during an unspecified amount of time after the original finale. Shark and Square Guy have returned somehow, and are trying to kidnap Fitz so they can return to the \\"real\\" world with the help of exterminator bee, Buzby (Dana Snyder). Skillet, Roostre, Peanut Cop, Golden Joe, and The New Guy (Mike Lazzo) must find and escape the simulation with Fitz before Shark and Square Guy do. Development =Production= According to Maiellaro, the series was pitched as a table read to the network. He jokingly stated that they accepted it after claiming that production costs would total \\"five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier.\\" Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from surrealism and the films of David Lynch. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting to work on the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. In November 2006, Maiellaro mentioned the possibility of continuing the series with webisodes, and he wrote five additional scripts for ending the series,http://www.shriekingtree.com/12_oz_Mouse/ but finally, he only produced one webisode, entitled \\"Enter the Sandmouse\\". Radical Axis provided animation for the series using Final Cut Pro. Described as \\"lo-fi animation\\", Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure, with the exception of Amalockh, a many-armed monster summoned in the season two episode \\"Corndog Chronicles\\", which was drawn and animated by Todd Redner at the studio, and Shark, which was borrowed from the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode \\"Kentucky Nightmare\\". In a behind-the-scenes clip of the show, Maiellaro explained that to animate the series, he would first grab a nearby sheet of copy paper, draw something, and then scan it, followed by him sending the file to an animator. Rhoda, a character from the series, was drawn on the back of a script page for Perfect Hair Forever. A scan of the paper revealed the textual contents behind it, which Maiellaro decided to leave in. =Cast= Matt Maiellaro, pictured in 2010, created the series while providing the voice of Mouse. Maiellaro cast people around his office to voice the characters. He provides the voice of the protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during the production of the pilot episode but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who \\"already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice\\", making him a \\"perfect\\" fit for him. Matt Harrigan was selected to voice Liquor, who is \\"always looking to make light of a situation\\", according to Maiellaro. Nick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop; Melissa Warrenburg portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater, who Maiellaro dubs \\"Robogirl\\". Bonnie Rosmarin voices Man/Woman, picked for what Maiellaro stated is a \\"pouty, stand-offish quality\\" in her delivery. Nick Ingkatanuwat voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark. Vocalist of Nine Pound Hammer Scott Luallen voices Roostre; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series. Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney; after hearing his first take on the character, Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines. He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to retroscript the rest. =Title sequence and music= Maiellaro spent three weeks working with Ingkatanuwat on putting together the set for the opening title sequence. The set was filmed with a motion control camera and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for special effect. Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song; Maiellaro sought a song representing the \\"carefree\\" lifestyle of Mouse who \\"does things like drive drunk, film porno and shoot guns.\\" Maiellaro, who plays the electric guitar in his free time, also composed the song \\"F-Off\\", featured in both the first episode and in \\"Auraphull\\", which he wrote while working on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Swedish heavy metal band Amaranthe performed the credits theme song for the 2018 special, \\"Invictus\\". =Revival= The June 14, 2018 episode of the Adult Swim streaming series Development Meeting featured a new clip from 12 oz. Mouse, which featured Seth Green as Fitz, hinting at a return to the series. It was later announced on September 18 of that year that the series would return for a half-hour special entitled \\"Invictus\\", which aired a month later on October 14. On the day of the special's airing, another announcement was made that the series would return for an 11-episode third season which aired in late July 2020. On March 31, 2020, the third season premiere aired unannounced at 2:45 AM EST with many other new episodes from Adult Swim shows as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools Prank. The whole third season premiered on July 20, 2020, and ended on July 31st. Episodes The pilot episode for 12 oz. Mouse, \\"Hired\\", premiered in June 2005 and became a regular series in the Adult Swim lineup in October 2005. An Adult Swim bumper shown with the sixth installment claimed that twenty additional episodes were being produced and taunted viewers who had complained they couldn't understand the absurdist presentation. On December 31, 2005, a marathon of the series aired, replaying all six episodes followed by the premiere of the then-unfinished seventh episode \\"Adventure Mouse\\". The second season aired on Adult Swim on Monday mornings at 12:45 a.m. EST from September 24, 2006 to December 17, 2006. On May 16, 2007, the 21st episode, entitled \\"Enter the Sandmouse\\", premiered as a webisode. On October 14, 2018, a half-hour special titled \\"Invictus\\" premiered on TV after having been released online two days earlier. Simultaneously, Adult Swim announced the series would be returning for a third season. The third season premiered unexpectedly on March 31, 2020 as part of that year's Adult Swim's April Fools Prank.  International broadcast  In Canada, 12 oz. Mouse previously aired on Teletoon's Teletoon at Night block,https://mediaincanada.com/2006/06/22/teletoon-20060622/ and currently airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim. Reception =Ratings= The season two episodes, \\"Auraphull\\" and \\"Meat Warrior\\", were respectively seen by 460,000 and 431,000 viewers upon broadcast. In addition, the episodes ranked as the thirteenth and twelfth most-watched episodes aired by the network for the week of October 23, 2006, also respectively. =Critical reception= The series has received generally positive critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series four out of five stars, opining that the series is \\"what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not- trying-to-be-cool way.\\" She found the crude animation \\"refreshing\\" but joked that the series \\"can kill\\" viewers not used to the slow pace. Writing for AOL TV, Adam Finley regarded the show as \\"the most simplistically drawn of all the Adult Swim shows, and yet the most complex in terms of story.\\" He contrasted it with other Williams Street productions, finding it to \\"instead unravels slowly, revealing a little bit more of what's underneath the surface while also piling on more and more questions.\\" Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media called it \\"the asymptote of the block's crude style\\". Justin Heckert of Atlanta magazine opined that \\"the animation and art look like they were done by daycare students\\". Other appearances The hip hop duo Danger Doom have produced a song inspired by 12 oz. Mouse entitled \\"Korn Dogz\\" from their EP Occult Hymn. The song uses audio clips from the episode \\"Rooster\\", with the line \\"Corn dogs for the pickin'\\" being recited by Danger Doom's MC MF Doom and Mouse Fitzgerald. A scene from the episode \\"Sharktasm\\" is visible in Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters. Home release A DVD release of the complete series was released February 29, 2008 (leap year), exclusively on the Williams Street shop. The DVD cover depicts Leonardo's The Last Supper with the series' characters replacing Christ and the twelve apostles. However, under a black light, the cover depicts the skeletons of the characters, as well as letters and symbols which make out an email address. The series is presented as a single, continuous movie, with newly produced footage bridging the gaps between episodes. It also features production footage, new music, the episode \\"Auraphull\\" in its entirety and collected fan art.

A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a static port, and the pitot-static instruments. Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers, flight data recorders, altitude encoders, cabin pressurization controllers, and various airspeed switches. Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical. Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to a failure of the pitot-static system. Diagram of a pitot-static system including the pitot tube, pitot-static instruments and static port  Pitot-static pressure  Examples of pitot tube, static tube, and pitot-static tube. Static ports fitted to an Airbus A330 passenger airliner. The pitot- static system of instruments uses the principle of air pressure gradient. It works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess the speed and altitude. These pressures can be measured either from the static port (static pressure) or the pitot tube (pitot pressure). The static pressure is used in all measurements, while the pitot pressure is used only to determine airspeed. = Pitot pressure = The pitot pressure is obtained from the pitot tube. The pitot pressure is a measure of ram air pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind. By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator. = Static pressure = The static pressure is obtained through a static port. The static port is most often a flush-mounted hole on the fuselage of an aircraft, and is located where it can access the air flow in a relatively undisturbed area. Some aircraft may have a single static port, while others may have more than one. In situations where an aircraft has more than one static port, there is usually one located on each side of the fuselage. With this positioning, an average pressure can be taken, which allows for more accurate readings in specific flight situations. An alternative static port may be located inside the cabin of the aircraft as a backup for when the external static port(s) are blocked. A pitot-static tube effectively integrates the static ports into the pitot probe. It incorporates a second coaxial tube (or tubes) with pressure sampling holes on the sides of the probe, outside the direct airflow, to measure the static pressure. When the aircraft climbs, static pressure will decrease. = Multiple pressure = Some pitot-static systems incorporate single probes that contain multiple pressure-transmitting ports that allow for the sensing of air pressure, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip data. Depending on the design, such air data probes may be referred to as 5-hole or 7-hole air data probes. Differential pressure sensing techniques can be used to produce angle of attack and angle of sideslip indications.  Pitot-static instrument  Airspeed indicator diagram showing pressure sources from both the pitot tube and static port The pitot-static system obtains pressures for interpretation by the pitot-static instruments. While the explanations below explain traditional, mechanical instruments, many modern aircraft use an air data computer (ADC) to calculate airspeed, rate of climb, altitude and Mach number. In some aircraft, two ADCs receive total and static pressure from independent pitot tubes and static ports, and the aircraft's flight data computer compares the information from both computers and checks one against the other. There are also \\"standby instruments\\", which are back-up pneumatic instruments employed in the case of problems with the primary instruments. = Airspeed indicator = The airspeed indicator is connected to both the pitot and static pressure sources. The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported. A traditional mechanical airspeed indicator contains a pressure diaphragm that is connected to the pitot tube. The case around the diaphragm is airtight and is vented to the static port. The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the mechanical linkage. Aneroid Wafer of an altimeter = Altimeter = The pressure altimeter, also known as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes. =Machmeter= Aircraft designed to operate at transonic or supersonic speeds will incorporate a machmeter. The machmeter is used to show the ratio of true airspeed in relation to the speed of sound. Most supersonic aircraft are limited as to the maximum Mach number they can fly, which is known as the \\"Mach limit\\". The Mach number is displayed on a machmeter as a decimal fraction. A vertical speed indicator = Vertical speed indicator = The variometer, also known as the vertical speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used to determine whether or not an aircraft is flying in level flight. The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a \\"restricted diffuser\\"). When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.  Pitot-static errors  There are several situations that can affect the accuracy of the pitot-static instruments. Some of these involve failures of the pitot-static system itself‚Äîwhich may be classified as \\"system malfunctions\\"‚Äîwhile others are the result of faulty instrument placement or other environmental factors‚Äîwhich may be classified as \\"inherent errors\\". = System malfunctions =  Blocked pitot tube  A blocked pitot tube is a pitot-static problem that will only affect airspeed indicators. A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant. (As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere.) This is caused by the pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. Conversely, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur- Built.  Blocked static port  A blocked static port is a more serious situation because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One of the most common causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. The vertical speed indicator will read zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases. The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit. = Inherent errors = Inherent errors may fall into several categories, each affecting different instruments. Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. This type of error is caused by variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression so there is no compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above and at airspeeds greater than . Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.  Position errors  Another class of inherent errors is that of position error. A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. This error is caused by the air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, and in the case of helicopters, rotor downwash. There are two categories of position errors, which are \\"fixed errors\\" and \\"variable errors\\". Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.  Lag errors  Lag errors are caused by the fact that any changes in the static or dynamic pressure outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges.Gracey, William. 1981. Measurement of Aircraft Speed and Altitude. New York: John Wiley & Sons. . p. 8. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.

This computer, rather than individual instruments, can determine the calibrated airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend data from an aircraft's pitot-static system.Air Data Computer, Avionics News, Kim Wiolland, 2015-01What Is an Air Data Computer?, Wisegeek.com, Retrieved 2015-06-25 In some very high speed aircraft such as the Space Shuttle, equivalent airspeed is calculated instead of calibrated airspeed. The first air data computer patented in the US was developed by John H. Andresen in February 1971. Air data computers usually also have an input of total air temperature. This enables computation of static air temperature and true airspeed. From the late 1980s much of the USAF and USN aircraft fleets were retrofitted with the GEC Avionics Rochester developed Standard Centralised Air Data Computer (SCADC). Aircraft fitted included the A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, A-7 Corsair, C-5A/B Galaxy, EA-6B Prowler, F-111 Aardvark, F-4 Phantom, S-3 Viking, C-141 Starlifter, C-135 Stratolifter, C-2 Greyhound, and E-2 Hawkeye,https://rochesteravionicarchives.co.uk/document- archive/brochures/standard-central-air-data-computer-1 for which the company received the Queens Award for Technological Achievement.https://rochesteravionicarchives.co.uk/media-archive/video/isd- queen-s-award-ceremony In Airbus aircraft the air data computer is combined with altitude, heading and navigation sources in a single unit known as the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) this has now been replaced by the Global Navigation Air Data Inertial Reference System (GNADIRS). In simpler aircraft including helicopters the Air Data Computers, generally two in number, and smaller, lighter and simpler than an ADIRU, may be called Air Data Units, although their internal computational power is still significant. They commonly have the pitot and static pressure inputs, as well as outside air temperature from a platinum resistance thermometer and may control heating of the pitot tube and static vent to prevent blockage due to ice. As on simpler aircraft there is usually not a fly by wire system, the outputs are typically to the cockpit altimeters or display system, flight data recorder and autopilot system. Output interfaces typically are ARINC 429, Gillham or even IEEE1394 (Firewire). The data provided may be true airspeed, pressure altitude, density altitude and Outside Air Temperature (OAT), but with no involvement in aircraft attitude or heading, as there are no gyroscopes or accelerometers fitted internally. These devices are usually autonomous and do not require pilot input, merely sending continuously updated data to the recipient systems while the aircraft is powered up. Some, like the Enhanced Software Configurble Air Data Unit (ESCADU)ESCADU are software configurable to suit many different aircraft applications.

According to acts of the General Synod passed the previous year, if a parish does not accept the ministry of women priests it can formally request that none be appointed to minister to it. Likewise, if the local bishop has participated in the ordination of women as priests, a parish can request to be under the pastoral and sacramental care of another bishop who has not participated in such ordinations. In such a case the parish still remains in the diocese of the local diocesan bishop, at whose invitation the \\"flying bishop\\" makes his visitation. On 4 December 2014, it was announced that the see of Maidstone would be filled again in order to provide a further provincial episcopal visitor for particular conservative evangelical members of the Church of England who take a complementarian view on headship.Thinking Anglicans ‚Äì Appointment of a bishop who takes a conservative evangelical view on headship, Accessed 4 December 2014. The act empowers the metropolitans of the Church of England's two provinces to appoint provincial episcopal visitors as suffragan bishops whose main purpose is to be available for such visits to parishes across the province. Accordingly, four PEV bishops have been appointed across the two provinces. In December 2010, the then-bishops of Richborough and Ebbsfleet resigned to join the Roman Catholic Church. On 5 May 2011, their successors as PEVs were announced.

He was also a retired major general of the Mississippi National Guard who served during World War II. Early life Born in Meridian, Mississippi to Emily Jones and Gillespie Montgomery, Montgomery graduated from McCallie School and Mississippi State University in Starkville in 1943. While in college, Montgomery joined the Beta Tau chapter of Kappa Alpha Order. Military service A 1943 Reserve Officers' Training Corps graduate, Gillespie was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He served with the 12th Armored Division in Europe during World War II. He served on active duty again during Korean War, this time as a member of the 31st Infantry Division. Montgomery was a member of the Mississippi Army National Guard until 1980, and retired as a major general. For his military service, Montgomery received the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal with \\"V\\" for Valor device, Army Commendation Medal and Combat Infantryman Badge. Business career Before running for Congress, he owned his own insurance company, the Montgomery Insurance Agency. In addition, he served as vice president of the Greater Mississippi Life Insurance Company of Meridian, Mississippi.

Bush, and Susan Akin in 1985 =Committee assignments= *Chairman, Select Committee on Military Involvement in Southeast Asia (Ninety-first Congress) *Chairman, Select Committee on Missing in Action in Southeast Asia (Ninety-fourth Congress) *Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee (Ninety-seventh through One Hundred Third Congresses) =Elections= Montgomery represented part of Meridian in the Mississippi State Senate between 1956 and 1966. He was elected to Congress from what was then the 4th District in 1966. Prentiss Walker, the first Republican elected to either house of Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction, had given up the seat after one term to run for the United States Senate against James O. Eastland. Montgomery defeated Lewis McAllister, also of Meridian, who had been the first Republican elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives since Reconstruction. Walker ran again for the seat in 1968 but lost to Montgomery, who received 70 percent of the vote. The latter was re-elected a total of fourteen times from the majority-white district, serving for thirty years until 1997. His district was renumbered as the 3rd District after the 1970 census, when Mississippi lost a district in redistricting Montgomery was one of the more conservative Democrats in the House. Most notably, he was known for being somewhat more \\"hawkish\\" than other members of his party. He was very popular in his district, usually winning reelection by some of the highest margins in the country. Although the district's voters were increasingly willing to vote Republican at the national level (it has only supported the official Democratic candidate for president once since 1956), at the local level Montgomery usually faced \\"sacrificial lamb\\" opponents on the few occasions he faced any Republican opposition at all. Montgomery ran unopposed from 1970 to 1974, in 1980, and from 1984 to 1990. In four elections‚Äî1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988‚ÄîMontgomery ran unopposed even as the Republican presidential candidate carried the district in a landslide. Observers assumed that Montgomery would be succeeded by a Republican after he retired, given the crossover of conservative white voters from the Democratic Party to the GOP in the second half of the 20th century. As it turned out, when Montgomery retired in 1996, the district was taken by Republican Chip Pickering in a landslide. The Democrats have only put up a candidate in the district four times since then, and have only won more than 35 percent of the vote once. =Tenure= Congressman Sonny Montgomery (second from left) receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was the author of the G.I. Bill of Rights that gives members of the service money to pay for college and was a lead sponsor in establishing the Veterans Affairs cabinet- level position. Montgomery gave a speech on the House floor in April 1975 in which he spoke against foreign aid to South Vietnam and said, \\"The South Vietnamese can blame only themselves for their present situation.\\" Montgomery's greatest legislative victory was the enactment of the bill that bears his name: the Montgomery GI Bill . In 1981, he came to the forefront to lead the fight for passage of a new G.I. Bill. As a World War Il veteran, he believed that the country should provide educational benefits to its service members and that the combination of military service and a college degree would make these individuals valuable assets to the country. He also wanted to reverse the Department of Defense's declining recruitment efforts, which had dropped sharply in the 1980s, and improve the overall quality of the volunteers. Nearly half of those recruited during that time lacked high-school diplomas and the basic skills needed in a modern military. Congressman Montgomery saw that educational shortfall as a direct threat to America's military readiness and national security.\\"Mr. Veteran\\": Congressman G.V. \\"Sonny\\" Montgomery will retire soon, but his legacy to veterans will live on\\".

Montgomery asserted that \\"further studies were needed to prove a connection between various diseases and Agent Orange before the government should be held liable for disability benefits\\" despite several such JAMA published studies by the National Cancer Institute and the VA and one by the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission.Nicosia, Gerald (2001),Home to War, Crown, p590 Subsequent scientific studies made connections between Agent Orange and Vietnam Veterans illnesses and the increased birth defects of their children. In 1991 Montgomery stood behind president George H.W. Bush at the signing of the Agent Orange Act. He had opposed a similar bill the previous year. After years of opposing Vietnam Veterans receiving disability for exposure to Agent Orange, he now appeared as their champion.Nicosia, Gerald (2001), Home to War, Crown, p612 In the same year he authored the Montgomery Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, which effectively transferred control of the National Guard away from the states and to the Department of Defense by prohibiting state governors from withholding National Guard forces. On September 13, 1988, Montgomery became the first congressman to lead the U.S. House in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as a permanent part of its daily and morning business operations. The day prior to his death, Congressman Gene Taylor introduced an amendment to a House Defense Appropriations Bill to rename the bill the Sonny Montgomery National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. Following his death, James F. Webb Funeral Home in Meridian, Mississippi performed the funeral services. President George W. Bush ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half staff. In addition, the U.S. House of Representatives canceled non-suspension votes on the day of his funeral. Montgomery was buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Meridian, Mississippi. He was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from Mississippi in 1996. On November 10, 2005, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest American civilian honor, by President George W. Bush.

In the serial, the Mara, an alien being from another plane uses the dreams of the time-travelling air stewardess Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) to reach the planet Deva Loka. The Mara takes over the body of the Kinda Aris (Adrian Mills) to attack colonists on the planet. Plot An Earth colonisation survey expedition to the beautiful jungle planet Deva Loka is being depleted as members of the survey disappear one by one. Four have gone, leaving the remainder somewhat apprehensive. Sanders relies on bombast and rules, while Hindle his deputy, is close to breaking point. Only Todd, the scientific officer, seems to deal with the situation with equanimity. She does not see the native people, the Kinda, as a threat but rather respects their culture and is intrigued by their power of telepathy. The social structure is also curious in that women seem dominant and are the only ones with the power of voice. The humans are holding two silent males hostage for \\"observation\\". Todd believes they are more advanced than they first appear, as they possess necklaces representative of the double helix of DNA, indicating a more advanced civilisation. Elsewhere in the jungle, the TARDIS crew are also under stress, especially Nyssa, who has collapsed from exhaustion. The Fifth Doctor constructs a delta wave augmenter to enable her to rest in the TARDIS, while he and Adric venture deeper into the jungle. They soon find an automated total survival suit (TSS) system, which activates and marches them to the Dome, the colonist base. Sanders is a welcoming but gruff presence, further undermining Hindle at regular intervals. Sanders decides to venture into the jungle in the TSS, leaving the highly- strung Hindle in charge. His will is enforced by means of the two Kinda hostages, who have forged a telepathic link with him, believing their souls to have been captured in his mirror. The Doctor, Todd and Adric are arrested as Hindle now evinces megalomania. Tegan faces a more metaphysical crisis. She has fallen asleep near the euphonious and soporific windchimes, unaware of the danger of the dreaming of an unshared mind (one not engaged in telepathy with another humanoid). Her mind opens in a void, where she undergoes provocation and terror from a series of nightmarish characters, one of which taunts her: \\"You will agree to being me, sooner or later, this side of madness or the other\\". The spectres are a manifestation of the Mara, an evil being of the subconscious that longs for corporeal reality. Mentally tortured, she eventually agrees to become the Mara and a snake symbol passes to her arm. When her mind returns to her body, she is possessed by the Mara. She passes the snake symbol to the first Kinda she finds, a young man named Aris, who is the brother of one of the Kinda in the Dome. He too is transformed by evil and now finds the power of voice. Back at the Dome, Hindle has conceived a bizarre and immolatory plan to destroy the jungle, which he views as a threat. Adric plays along with this delusion but Hindle‚Äôs world starts to fall apart when, first, Adric \\"betrays\\" him and then Sanders defies expectation and returns from the jungle. Sanders is radically different from the martinet in earlier episodes. Panna, an aged female mystic of the tribe, presented him with a strange wooden box called the \\"Box of Jhana\\" which, when opened, cleared his mind and left him a more contented and enlightened person. When Hindle continues to claim authority over the Dome, Sanders plays along with his deputy's megalomania - \\"As you like. You know best.\\" He still has the box and shows it to Hindle, who makes the Doctor open it. The Doctor and Todd see beyond the toy inside and share a vision from Panna and her young ward, Karuna, who invites them to a cave. The shock of the situation (accompanied by strange phenomena) allow the Doctor and Todd to slip away into the jungle, where they encounter Aris dominating a group of Kinda and seemingly fulfilling a tribal prophecy that \\"When the Not-We come, one will arise from among We, a male with Voice who must be obeyed.\\" Karuna soon finds the Doctor and Todd and takes them to meet Panna in the cave from the vision, with the wise woman realising the danger of the situation now Aris has voice. She places them in a trance like state and reveals that the Mara has gained dominion on Deva Loka. The Great Wheel, which turns as civilisations rise and fall has turned again and the hour is near when chaos will reign, instigated by the Mara. The vision she shares is Panna‚Äôs last act: when it is finished, she is dead. In the Kinda world, multiple fathers are shared by children, just as multiple memories are held and at Panna's death, her life experience transfers to Karuna. She urges Todd and the Doctor to return to the Dome, to prevent Aris leading an attack on it, which will increase the chaos and hasten the collapse of Kinda civilisation. At the Dome, Hindle, Sanders and Adric remain in a state of unreality, with the former becoming ever more demented, unbalanced, and infantile. Sanders continues to humour him, even to the point of talking Adric out of an initial escape attempt. Adric does eventually escape, however, and attempts to pilot the TSS but is soon confronted by Aris and the Kinda. He panics and Aris is wounded by the machine (which responds to the mental impulses of the operator) and the Kinda scatter. The Doctor and Todd find an emotionally wrecked and sleeping Tegan near the windchimes and conclude that she was the path of the Mara back into this world. They find Adric and the party heads back to the Dome, where Hindle has now completed the laying of explosives, which will incinerate the jungle and the Dome, the ultimate self- defence. Hindle is tricked into opening the Box of Jhana and the visions therein restore his mental balance as with Sanders. The two enslaved Kinda are freed when the mirror entrapping them is shattered. The Doctor then devises the only method of combating the Mara; since evil cannot face itself, he organises the construction of a large circle of mirrors (actually reflective solar panels) in a jungle clearing. Aris is trapped within it and the snake on his arm breaks free, whereupon he is pulled from the circle. The Mara swells to giant proportions but is then banished back from the corporeal world to the Dark Places of the Inside. With the threat of the Mara dissipated and the personnel of the Dome back to more balanced selves, the Doctor, Adric and an exhausted Tegan decide to leave (as does Todd, who decides 'it's all a bit green'). When they reach the TARDIS, Nyssa greets them, fully recovered. Production The working title for this story was The Kinda. This was the first story Eric Saward oversaw as script editor, though Castrovalva was broadcast earlier. Nyssa makes only brief appearances at the start of episode 1, and at the end of 4, because the script had largely been developed at a time when only two companions for the Doctor were envisioned. When it was known a third companion would also be present, rather than write Nyssa into the entire storyline it was decided she would remain in the TARDIS throughout and be absent through most of the narrative. To account for this absence, Nyssa was scripted to collapse at the end of the previous story, Four to Doomsday. In this story, she remains in the TARDIS, resting. Themes and analysis This serial was examined closely in the 1983 media studies volume Doctor Who: The Unfolding Text by John Tulloch and Manuel Alvarado. This was the first major scholarly work dedicated to Doctor Who. Tulloch and Alvarado compare Kinda with Ursula K. Le Guin's 1976 novel The Word for World Is Forest, which shares several themes with Kinda and may have been a template for its story. The Unfolding Text also examines the way \\"Kinda\\" incorporates Buddhist and Christian symbols and themes, as well as elements from the writings of Carl Jung. Broadcast and reception The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from 22‚Äì25 August 1983, achieving viewing figures of 4.2, 4.3, 3.9 and 5.0 million viewers respectively. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), writing, \\"One of the best Doctor Who stories ever, astonishingly directed and written as a theatrical piece brimming with allusions and parallels. It's also got a direct and unsilly performance from Simon Rouse, and a thoughtful one from Nerys Hughes.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the dream sequences, the \\"intelligence and sophistication\\" of the script and direction, as well as the main cast. They felt that these outweighed the more negative aspects, such as a plot that could be hard to follow and the unconvincing alien environment and snake. In 2012, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times called Kinda \\"an imperfect gem\\", with some production shortcomings in an otherwise worthwhile story. He praised the guest cast and the \\"unusually adult psychodrama\\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn said that the strength of the serial was \\"the way it behaves like an experimental stage-theater piece\\", with the highlight being Tegan's dream sequences. However, he felt that a problem was that the TARDIS crew was \\"kind of sidelined ... and rather passive\\", with the Doctor merely reacting to events. DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave Kinda three and a half out of five stars, describing it as fun and interesting, though with its fair share of poor special effects. Ian Berriman of SFX gave the serial a positive review, highlighting its adult tone and the strong female roles. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in December 1983. In 1997, the novel was also issued by BBC Audio as an audio book, read by Peter Davison. =Home media= Kinda was released on VHS in October 1994 with a cover illustration by Colin Howard.

Due to their dynamic role within the extracellular matrix they are considered matricellular proteins. The first member of the family, thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), was discovered in 1971 by Nancy L. Baenziger. Types The thrombospondins are a family of multifunctional proteins. The family consists of thrombospondins 1-5 and can be divided into 2 subgroups: A, which contains TSP-1 and -2, and B, which contains TSP-3, -4 and -5 (also designated cartilage oligomeric protein or COMP). TSP-1 and -2 are homotrimers, consisting of three identical subunits, whereas TSP-3, -4 and -5 are homopentamers. TSP-1 and TSP-2 are produced by immature astrocytes during brain development, which promotes the development of new synapses. =Thrombospondin 1= Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is encoded by THBS1. It was first isolated from platelets that had been stimulated with thrombin, and so was designated 'thrombin-sensitive protein'. Since its first recognition, functions for TSP-1 have been found in multiple biological processes including angiogenesis, apoptosis, activation of TGF-beta and Immune regulation. As such, TSP-1 is designated a multifunctional protein. TSP-1 has multiple receptors, among which CD36, CD47 and integrins are of particular note. TSP-1 is antiangiogenic, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by interactions with CD36 expressed on their surface of these cells. Inhibitory peptides and fragments of TSP1 bind to CD36, leading to the expression of FAS ligand (FasL), which activates its specific, ubiquitous receptor, Fas. This leads to the activation of caspases and apoptosis of the cell. Since tumors overexpressing TSP-1 typically grow slower, exhibit less angiogenesis, and have fewer metastases, TSP1 is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Because TSP1 is extremely large (~120 kDa monomer), not very abundant and exerts multiple actions, its clinical usefulness is questionable. However, small-molecules based on a CD36-binding peptide sequence from TSP1 are being tested. One analog, ABT-510, exhibits potent proapoptotic activity in cultured cells, while clinically it is very well tolerated with therapeutic benefits reported against several malignancies. In 2005, ABT-510 was evaluated in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of several types of cancer.

Eucalyptus trees bordering the road were planted in 1936 to dry marshlands and help combat malaria. Gulf of G√∂kova () or Gulf of Kerme (Turkish: Kerme K√∂rfezi, Greek: ŒöŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒµŒπŒ∫œåœÇ Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøœÇ, Latin: Ceramicus Sinus, English: Ceramic Gulf or Gulf of Cos), is a long (100 km), narrow gulf of the Aegean Sea between Bodrum Peninsula and Dat√ßa Peninsula in south-west Turkey. Administratively, Gulf of G√∂kova coastline includes portions of the districts of, clockwise, Bodrum, Milas, Muƒüla, Ula, Marmaris and Dat√ßa. The Greek island of Kos lies along the entry into the Gulf. Bodrum, located in its northwest reaches, is the only large city on the gulf today. In ancient times, alongside Halicarnassus (modern-day Bodrum), the city of Ceramus, located midway along the gulf's northern shore and after which the gulf was named, was also an important urban center. Across Ceramus (Gereme) (in the modern township of ), at a short distance from the gulf's southern shore and not far from its outlying waters, was another historical site of note, called Cedrae in ancient times. Cedrae was located in Sedir Island, which was prized by visitors for its beach and of which some remains still exist. Etymology The alluvial plain, also named G√∂kova, which extends to the Gulf's end, is the location of the townships of Akyaka and G√∂kova, with only a few kilometers separating the two. These settlements saw their populations considerably increase in recent years, with Akyaka, especially, becoming a rising center of tourism. The municipalities of both of these townships were recently created. They depend upon the town of Ula, which is accessed through Sakar Pass at an altitude of 670 meters and offers an impressive view of the Gulf. Until 1945, the hamlets across the plain, mostly marshlands ridden with malaria until that time, were collectively known as G√∂kabad. Consequently, the gulf and one of the settlements came to be called G√∂kova, a term which is often used to designate the area in which Akyaka, and not the neighboring township of G√∂kova, is actually prominent. In sum, the name, G√∂kova, (possibly derived from Cova, the designation by which the area was known in Ottoman times) is mentioned as \\"Djova\\" in some recent English navigation charts and alternately is used for the gulf, for the plain at the end of the same gulf, for a township situated in the same plain, and as a casual term covering the emerging resort area centered in the coastal town of Akyaka. The Carian city of Idyma, with acropolis and famed rock tombs, is found at Kozlukuyu, G√∂kova town, inland from Akyaka. In ancient times, Akyaka was simply a suburb of Kozlukuyu.

Design and development Bellanca established itself in the market for 6-8 seat aircraft, but believed that it could also successfully sell smaller 3-4 seat aircraft. To fill this niche Bellanca designed The '14-7 Cruisair' as a modern, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fuselage intended to contribute lift to the design. Although the prototype flew with fixed tailwheel undercarriage, the 14-9 production version was the first US light aircraft to be mass-produced with retractable undercarriage, the main wheels rotating aft into wheel-wells in the wings, with approximately 50 produced before production was interrupted by World War II. Bellanca 14-13-2 After WWII Bellanca resumed production with the up-dated Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior, retaining the Bellanca 14-7's basic design, featuring an enlarged cabin, a horizontally opposed Franklin 6A4-335-B3 engine in place of the earlier models' Le Blond radial and an oval vertical endplate on each horizontal stabiliser. This latter feature gained the type the affectionate nickname \\"Cardboard Constellation\\", because the arrangement is similar to the contemporary Lockheed Constellation airliner.1978 Aircraft Directory 1977, p. 20. The naming convention for Bellanca aircraft was followed with the Cruisair series, with the first number giving the wing area in square feet, (dropping the final digit), while the second number is the aircraft's horsepower, (again dropping the final digit). Construction of the series is fairly conventional with wings constructed of spruce with plywood skin and fuselages built up from a welded steel-tube framework with a fabric covering. A constant process of refinement led to many variants, sometimes given new names but retaining the same structure differing only in powerplant, minor details and furnishings. The only major variations were the introduction of a single swept fin and tri- cycle retractable undercarriage. Production was carried out at a variety of companies, including Bellanca, Downer, Aviabellanca, Northern Aircraft and Inter-Air, with little variation other than powerplant and furnishings. The highly responsive flying characteristics of the aircraft are evident to anyone who has flown one. Bill Cox, the well known aviation journalist at Plane and Pilot Magazine commented regarding the flying qualities of Vikings that they \\"have long been famous for control response and harmony that seems almost psychic in nature\\" , and asserted, \\"Owners almost unanimously pronounce the Viking the best handling airplane they've ever flown.\\" Pre-war development culminated in the 1941 14-12, at which point production ceased to allow Bellanca to work as a military subcontractor for the duration of the war when an attempt to market a militarized version as a trainer was unsuccessful. After the war, Bellanca returned to the design to create the Bellanca 14-13 and its successors. Bellanca 14-13-2 =Model 14-13= The 14-13 was introduced in 1946; in its improved 14-13-3 version the aircraft remained in production until 1956. =Model 14-19= A higher performance design revision was granted FAA approval as the 14-19 Cruisemaster on September 26, 1949,.\\"Specification 1A3.\\" Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Aircraft. The new model featured structural upgrades, a Lycoming O435-A engine, an increased gross weight of 2,600 lbs, hydraulically operated landing gear and flaps, and a deluxe interior. 99 of these airplanes were produced between 1949 and 1951. Externally, a near-look-alike to the earlier models, this version was distinguished by its larger, oval-shaped endplates.Bellanca Champion Club Literature. All production ceased in 1956 as Bellanca wound up its operations. Bellanca 14-19-2 Cruisemaster, built 1958 =Model 14-19-2= The 14-19 design was revived by Northern Aircraft and granted FAA approval on January 7, 1957 as the 14-19-2 Cruisemaster. The new model featured a Continental O-470K engine, an increased gross weight of 2,700 pounds, an updated instrument panel as well as new paint and upholstery schemes.1957 Bellanca 14-19-2 Owners Manual. 104 of these airplanes were produced between 1957 and 1958 The company was renamed Downer Aircraft in 1959. Inter-Air acquired the production rights in 1962 and was renamed as the Bellanca Sales Company, a subsidiary of Miller Flying Service. Further development of the design by Inter-Air resulted in the modernized Viking series introduced in 1962.Palmer 2001, p. 51. 1946 model Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior at the Western Canada Aviation Museum- note the large endplates of the initial 14-13 =Bellanca Viking= The Bellanca Viking and Super Viking were developed through modifications of the 'Cruisair' designs by the aviation pioneer Giuseppe Bellanca. Derived directly from the Cruisair, the Viking introduced a swept single tail of similar area, replacing the triple-tail of earlier aircraft, initially manufactured by Downer Aircraft as the Model 260 starting around 1958. The Viking model was born out of discussions at Downer for a bigger version of the \\"Model 260\\" with at least 300 horsepower. The Minnesota based company employed skilled craftsman who manufactured the wing from spruce and the new 300 hp model was named the \\"Viking\\" in respect to the many Scandinavians of the area. The first Model 17 Viking appeared in 1967 called the \\"17-30\\" it was powered by a 300 hp Continental IO-520-K. In 1969 a Viking powered by a 290 hp (later 300 hp) Lycoming IO-540 was introduced, either normally aspirated (17-31) or turbocharged (17-31TC). Bellanca Super Viking photographed at Centennial Airport Over the years there were a number of refinements in the aircraft. The original hydraulic gear and flap actuation system was redesigned in 1968 introducing electric flaps. In 1969 the FAA issued Type Certificate A18CE and the aircraft built under that design were designated the \\"A\\" series \\"Super Vikings\\". Aside from refinements already made to late Viking 300 models, the new 300A Vikings (17-30A, 17-31A and 17-31ATC) had a gross weight increase to 3,325 lbs. The original complex fuel system with five tanks and two fuel selectors allowing eight possible combinations of selector settings was simplified to a left, right and auxiliary system in 1974. In 1979 the Continental powered Vikings sported a fully enclosed nosewheel thanks to a redesign of the engine mount. This necessitated the use of cowl flaps for the first time on the Viking but resulted in a 12 mph increase. In 1979 production of the Lycoming powered 17-31A ceased. In 1996, the Continental IO-550 was made available as an option. Viking Operational history Designed and produced in the post-World War II era, the Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior was aimed at a general aviation market. Pilot/owners were offered a combination of performance, low engine power and a modest price of $4500. Its performance and structural strength also made it attractive for utility work, but in many ways the Bellanca design was an anachronism, relying on a conventional landing gear configuration and wood and fabric construction that harkened back to an earlier age. Postwar economics along with a glut of surplus military aircraft precluded heavy sales although about 600 were produced. Despite its introduction into a period where private aircraft sales were stagnant, the aircraft remained popular through all of its incarnations and today is considered a classic cabin monoplane and is much in demand.\\"Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair history.\\" Pilotfriend.com, 2009. Retrieved: May 17, 2009. Since 2002 the company has been operated by a group of six Bellanca enthusiasts who bought the company from the state of Minnesota and established Alexandria Aircraft Co. LLC, providing technical support and parts for owners and maintenance organisations in the field. New aircraft have been available from Alexandria Aircraft Co., who have sold one new aircraft manufactured in 2005.

She first appeared as Martha Roberts in Feature Comics #27 (December 1939) and as Doll Girl in Doll Man #37 (December 1951). A new version later appeared in Titans Secret Files #2 (October 2000). Fictional character biography =Martha Roberts= Martha Roberts was the daughter of Professor Roberts, who tutored his young prot√©g√© Darrel Dane in his home laboratory. During the summer of 1939, Martha was being blackmailed by a criminal named Falco over love letters she had written one of her former college teachers. After imbibing a concoction, Dane found himself shrunk to the height of six inches, but with his normal strength intact. Martha sewed him new clothes to wear, and he began to worry that he might never be able to regain his normal height. Martha Roberts debuts as Doll Girl in Doll Man #37. After refusing to pay Falco any more blackmail money, Martha was kidnapped by Falco and rescued by the \\"doll man\\". Finding that through intense concentration Dane could affect his height, he decided to begin to fight crime as the Doll Man, often assisted by Martha (who also became his scientific research assistant). Several years later, while wishing and concentrating about being able to shrink down to aid Doll Man, Darrel also was thinking about the same thing and suddenly, Martha's height and weight dwindled down until she was on the same scale as Doll Man. She began to team with Doll Man as Midge, the Doll Girl.Doll Man #37 (December 1951) She fights \\"the Skull, the Druids, the Count de Grasso, and the houngan Dr. Voodoo. After Quality Comics went out of business in 1956, DC Comics acquired their superhero characters. Doll Man and several other former Quality properties were re-launched in Justice League of America #107 (October 1973) as the Freedom Fighters. As was done with many other characters DC had acquired from other publishers or that were holdovers from Golden Age titles, the Freedom Fighters were located on a parallel world, one called \\"Earth-X\\" where Nazi Germany had won World War II. The team were featured in their own series for fifteen issues (1976‚Äì1978), in which the team temporarily leaves Earth-X for Earth-One (where most DC titles were set). It was revealed during the Freedom Fighters series that Martha Roberts was now deceased on Earth-X, and Doll Man later encountered the Earth-One version of Roberts. The Earth-One Martha Roberts became a supporting character in the series and also guest- starred in Teen Titans #47 as a reporter. Reprinted at: The Earth-One Martha Roberts appears in Freedom Fighters #13. Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths, a story that was intended to eliminate the similarly confusing histories that DC had attached to its characters by retroactively merging the various parallel worlds into one, Doll Girl's Earth-X and Earth-One days were erased and her histories were merged as one. In Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #4 (February 2008), it is revealed that Martha is deceased, killed by cancer. She was unable to get medical treatment because of her small size. =Titans Secret Files= A version of Doll Man and Doll Girl about whom little has been revealed briefly appeared in Titans Secret Files #2. This Doll Girl also had a cameo in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #174. Powers and abilities As Doll Girl, Martha Roberts could shrink through mental concentration to a height of 5 and 1/2 inches. She retained her normal strength and was a fair hand-to-hand combatant. She could pilot the small \\"flying saucer\\" that the duo used and was able to use other small vehicles as needed. Other versions In Kingdom Come, the Doll Man/Doll Girl franchise is represented by a female character named Living Doll, wearing the Doll Girl costume, and is seen sitting on Superman's shoulder acting as a sort of secretary for the Justice League. She is the daughter of the original Doll Man and Doll Girl. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, the 52‚Äôs Earth-10 universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-X.

(Suffragan bishops are appointed through a much simpler process, reflecting their status as directly responsible to their diocesan bishop.) Current procedures Since 1976, when a diocesan bishop (including those of the 42 English dioceses and the Bishop of Sodor and Man but not the Bishop in Europe)The process in the Diocese in Europe is described in its diocesan handbook. dies, retires or moves on and leaves a diocesan bishopric vacant, the process of replacing them involves several stages. The first of these involves the diocesan Vacancy-in- See Committee, composed of: * The dean of the diocese's cathedral * Two archdeacons * The diocese's representative members of the General Synod of the Church of England * Members of the diocesan House of Bishops * The chairman and two other members of the diocesan House of Clergy * The chairman and two other members of the diocesan House of Laity * Other members approved by the Bishop's Council The committee produces a ‚ÄúStatement of Needs‚Äù assessing the needs of the diocese. It then sends this statement to the Crown Nominations Commission (known until 2003 as the Crown Appointments Commission), which consists of: * The Archbishops of Canterbury and York (in the event of a vacancy in either post, then the House of Bishops elects another bishop to take that Archbishop's place) * Three members elected by the General Synod's House of Clergy from within itself * Three members elected by the General Synod's House of Laity from itself * Six members elected ad hoc by the Vacancy-in-See Committee from itself Beyond these fourteen voting members, the Prime Minister's Appointments Secretary and the Archbishops' appointments secretary meet with the commission and help supply it with information on possible candidates. Normally the archbishop in whose province the vacancy lies chairs the commission. When meeting to nominate an archbishop, the commission is chaired by a fifteenth voting member, who must be an \\"actual communicant lay member of the Church of England\\". He or she is appointed by the prime minister (if an Archbishop of Canterbury is being appointed) or by the Church of England Appointments Committee (if an Archbishop of York). The commission meets several times in secret. The commission then forwards two names to the prime minister, who chooses one of them, or (exceptionally) requests additional names from the commission. In recent memory, the only prime minister who has not accepted the commission's preferred candidate was Margaret Thatcher, who opposed Jim Thompson‚Äôs nomination as Bishop of Birmingham, due to his (perceived) liberal and left-leaning views. Since 2007 the convention has been that the prime minister will choose the first-named recommendation. If the chosen individual accepts the office, the prime minister advises the Sovereign, who then formally nominates the prime minister's choice. Thereafter, the diocese's College of Canons meets to 'elect' the new bishop. (This stage of the process was mocked by Ralph Waldo Emerson thus: \\"The King sends the Dean and Canons a cong√© d'√©lire, or leave to elect, but also sends them the name of the person whom they are to elect. They go into the Cathedral, chant and pray; and after these invocations invariably find that the dictates of the Holy Ghost agree with the recommendation of the King\\" [Emerson, English Traits, XIII, 1856].) Following the election, the new bishop must be confirmed in office. A provincial ceremony takes place where the bishop-elect swears an oath. During the ceremony, the appropriate archbishop confers the spiritualities of the see on the bishop-elect, who then takes office. At a later point, the monarch confers the temporalities of the see, which formerly included vast church estates and the bishop's residence, but which have now become more limited. If the bishop has never previously received consecration as a bishop, he must be consecrated; both the confirmation of election and episcopal consecration (if any) generally take place to suit the archbishop's convenience and always on a Principal Feast or Festival of the Church year. Episcopal consecrations normally happen in York Minster for a bishop of the northern province, or, for a bishop of the southern province, in Canterbury Cathedral or one of the great churches or cathedrals in London (such as St Paul's or Southwark Cathedral), or Westminster Abbey. Finally, a symbolic ceremony of installation or enthronement takes place in the bishop's new cathedral, during which he is welcomed by his new diocese and first sits in his cathedra. Future possibilities In July 2007, shortly after taking office as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown released a green paper outlining several proposed reforms of the Prime Minister's ability to exercise traditional Royal Prerogative powers. Among these were several which could affect Church of England appointments, including those of diocesan bishops. The proposed scheme would see (in future) a single name emerge from the Crown Nominations Commission, rather than two, which the Prime Minister would simply pass along to the Queen. Furthermore, the role of the Prime Minister's appointments secretary would be reduced or even eliminated. It was agreed that from 2007 the first-named candidate would be selected by the prime minister, unless a change in circumstances meant that candidate could no longer accept the post.

English discipline came into existence in 1998, but the academic activities started from 1999. A language centre was established. In Bangladesh, English Literature is a celebrated curriculum preferred by the students. The discipline is GPA-oriented. Under Arts and Humanities School, English discipline offers one undergraduate and two postgraduate programmes; one of the two MAs is MA in English, with courses in contemporary literature in English, linguistics, and literary theory; the other is MA in English Language that teaches current theoretical and practical courses in English language and linguistics. =Environmental Science discipline= Environmental Science as an undergraduate teaching programme is relatively a new one in this country. Khulna University opened the discipline in 1997. The subject incorporates physical, chemical and biological sciences, engineering and technology, socio- economics and management. The discipline offers a four-year undergraduate (Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science) and one and half years postgraduate (Master of Science in Environmental Science) degrees and offers a PhD programme. =Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology discipline= The greater Khulna region, the south west part of Bangladesh has been characterised by a blend of aquatic habitats; fresh, brackish and marine waters supporting a diversity of biological and physical resources. Situated a few kilometres away from the Bay of Bengal this region is blessed with Sunderbans, the world largest mangrove forest crisscrossed by creeks and canals. Understanding the potential of such resources to the prospects of the country, the Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology Discipline was established in 1992 with a mandate to establish an avenue for research and academic programs in all aspects of fisheries for the second time in the country after Chittagong University. Chittagong University introduced undergraduate and postgraduate level education in Marine Science under the Institute of Marine Science and Fisheries (IMSCU) in early seventies . Over the last fourteen years the FMRT Discipline has experienced substantial growth resulting in a reputation for training and research, particularly with respect to coastal aquaculture and mangrove ecosystem. The course followed in the discipline has provisions for education in biology, ecology, culture and post harvest fisheries. The course, in addition, involves socio-economics, statistics, GIS and remote sensing, computer application etc. The teaching staff of the discipline possess knowledge in fish biology, marine science, aquaculture, fisheries management, genetics and fish breeding, ecology, oceanography and post harvest technology. The FMRT discipline is now preparing to launch PhD courses in addition to BSc and M.S. ones. =Forestry and Wood Technology discipline= After the Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences of Chittagong University Forestry and Wood Technology (FWT) discipline launched its academic activities in 1992, offering a four-year Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Forestry and a one-year Master of Science (MS) degree in Forestry. The discipline is close to the world's largest single-tract mangrove forest, Sundarbans, and the forest-deficient northern region of the country where forest extension and social forestry programmes are increasingly realized. Given this geographic consideration, the mission of FWT discipline in education and research stresses on mangrove forestry, social forestry, forest management, forest tree improvement and wood science and technology. =History and Civilization discipline= History and Civilization Discipline will start their journey from the academic year 2016‚Äì2017, offering a 4-year Bachelor of Arts degree (abbreviated as B.A. (Hons.)) in History and Civilization. =Human Resource Management discipline= Human Resource Management (HRM) is a newly introduced discipline in Khulna University. The discipline has begun a Bachelor program from the academic year 2015‚Äì2016. =Law and Justice Discipline= Law and Justice discipline is another new discipline of Khulna University, offering 4 years LLB(Hons) course from the academic year 2016‚Äì2017.

This discipline also offers PhD program from researchers. =Pharmacy discipline= Most of the present day medicines are directly or indirectly obtained from plants of local origin and those of the Sundarbans, a large source of medicinal plants. Some of the reported medicinal plants enjoy their use in the herbal preparation. But most of the plants need to be scientifically evaluated. To this end, Pharmacy Discipline started its academic activities in 1997 under Life Science School offering a four years Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hons.) degree with an aim of proper evaluation of the plants of medicinal value available in the mangrove forest as well as of medicinal plants in the native southern region. =Physics discipline= Physics discipline started in the academic session 2009‚Äì2010. This discipline currently offers BSc(Hons.), MSc in Physics. This discipline is also enrolling students for M.Phil and PhD program in Physics.This discipline achieved two gold medalists and many trophy with volleyball inter discipline tournament. =Soil, Water and Environment discipline= Soil Science Discipline at Khulna University has both an illustrious past and significant prospects for contributing to the future. Established in 1999 as Soil Science Discipline, it was renamed as Soil, Water and Environment Discipline in 2017. The current name reflects the expertise and areas where the department faculty and students can and are expected to make major contributions. The Discipline provides undergraduate and graduate teaching, conducts extensive research, and has significant extension outreach responsibilities. Because the soils, environment, and water resources vary greatly over the country, the discipline's activities are similarly widespread. The course and curriculum provide graduates with knowledge in the field of Soil Genesis, Hydrology, Soil Physics, Soil Chemistry, Soil Biochemistry, Soil Microbiology,Ecology and Ecosystems, Soil Mineralogy, Soil Survey, Land Evaluation, Soil Erosion and Conservation, Sustainable Land use, Watershed Management, Irrigation & Drainage Technology, Groundwater Hydrology, Agronomy, Soil Fertility and Plant Nutrition, and Soil Management and others environmental related courses.

The DC-4E never entered production due to being superseded by an entirely new design, the Douglas DC-4/C-54, which proved very successful. Many DC-4E design features found their way into the Japanese Nakajima G5N bomber. Design and development The design originated in 1935 from a requirement by United Air Lines.Pearcy 1995, p. 17. The goal was to develop a much larger and more sophisticated replacement for the DC-3 before the first DC-3 had even flown.Yenne 1985, p. 122. There was enough interest from other airlines that American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Pan American Airways and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA) joined United, providing $100,000 each toward the cost of developing the new aircraft. As cost and complexity rose, Pan American and TWA withdrew their funds in favor of the Boeing 307, which was anticipated to be less costly. The giant new DC-4E at the United Air Lines base at Oakland Airport With a planned day capacity of 42 passengers (13 rows of two or more seats and a central aisle) or 30 as a sleeper transport (like the DST), the DC-4 (as it was then known) would seat twice as many people as the DC-3 and would be the first large aircraft with a nosewheel. Other innovations included auxiliary power units, power-boosted flight controls, alternating current electrical system and air conditioning. Cabin pressurization was also planned for production aircraft. The novel tail with three low vertical stabilizers enabled use of existing hangars and provided sufficient vertical fin area to allow the aircraft to take off with only two engines on one side operating. The wing planform was similar to the DC-3, with a swept leading edge and almost straight trailing edge. The four Pratt & Whitney R-2180-A Twin Hornet 14-cylinder radials were all mounted with noticeable toe-out, particularly the outer pair.Francillon 1988, pp. 266‚Äì268. Operational history The prototype (NX18100, s/n 1601) first flew, without incident, on June 7, 1938 from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California, piloted by Carl Cover. Testing issues, however, delayed the Approved Type Certificate until May 5, 1939. It was used by United Air Lines for in-service evaluation during 1939. On June 9, 1939, when the DC-4 was in Dayton, Ohio, along with Carl Cover, Orville Wright was a passenger on a flight over the city. Although the aircraft was relatively trouble-free, the complex systems proved to be expensive to maintain and performance was below expectations, especially with an increase in seating to 52 and gross weight to . The design was abandoned in favor of a marginally smaller, less-complex four-engined design, with a single vertical fin and 21 feet (6.4 meters) shorter wingspan. This newer design was also designated DC-4, leading the earlier design to be redesignated DC-4E (E for \\"experimental\\"). In late 1939, the DC-4E was sold to Imperial Japanese Airways, which was buying American aircraft for evaluation and technology transfer during this period; it was reverse-engineered and became the basis for the unsuccessful Nakajima G5N bomber. The Japanese press reported shortly after purchase that the aircraft had crashed in Tokyo Bay, but it was being secretly studied by military and corporate interests at Nakajima.Westell 1999. pp. 18, 49‚Äì50.

He was the most famous organist in Italy in the mid-15th century.  Life  He was born in Florence to a butcher with the family name of Giovanni; however he took the name of Squarcialupi, a well-known family from Tuscany, by mid-century, possibly to disguise his less than aristocratic origins. Most of his early life must have been spent in Florence, and he likely studied with both organist Giovanni Mazzuoli (also called Jovannes de Florentia, who was a pupil of Francesco Landini), as well as Matteo di Pagolo da Prato. He acquired the post of organist at the Orsanmichele in Florence in 1431, but only remained there for two years, moving instead to the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, at which post he remained for the rest of his life. He has been honored with a bust in this church. Music and influence Squarcialupi was part of the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, and was also a colleague of Guillaume Dufay; there are numerous laudatory references to him in the middle of the 15th century, some, for instance that of diarist Luca Landucci, comparing him in stature to figures such as the sculptor Donatello. Evidently he was quite close to Lorenzo, and this is mentioned in his epitaph in Florence Cathedral. None of his music has survived. His principal fame in music history, aside from his fame as an organist, is to have given his name to the splendid Squarcialupi Codex, a document he owned (but did not compile), and which is the richest source of music from Italy of the 14th century.

It's the second game in the City Building series. Gameplay When the game begins the Roman empire extends no further than Italy. Players have the opportunity to civilize adjacent barbarian provinces, eventually reaching the entire Roman Empire at its height. When a province is civilized it unlocks the surrounding provinces. A computerized rival also completes missions both preventing the player from civilizing that province and allowing them to civilize the provinces adjacent to it (the computer has been known to civilize a province it could not have selected when it successfully civilized the last, meaning it is a randomized event, rather than AI). Unlike Caesar III, or Pharaoh, the province and city are separate spheres, as is the military. The player builds primary industry (such as mines or farms), trade facilities (such as roads or docks), and military facilities (such as forts and walls) on one map and builds their city houses, secondary industry (such as wineries or potters), and tertiary industry (such as fire stations, police stations, bath houses) on another (represented as four squares in the center of the provincial map). Also unlike later games walkers are not required to bring services to people, which is instead determined by one buildings distance from another. Invading Armies differ from later games as well, in that Barbarian towns exist within many provinces from which Barbarian armies can emanate. These are converted to Roman towns through invading them and defeating the inhabitants. Most missions require the player to pacify a province and raise the citizens standard of living to a certain level, while neither suffering a military loss, nor losing the emperor's favour, often within a certain time frame. Major factors in city and province- building are housing values and types of housing, unemployment/labour shortages, taxes, wages, deficits, food shortages, military readiness and morale, and imperial demands. The game is won when the player has conquered sufficient provinces to attain the rank of Caesar. The game is lost if the player's computerized rival becomes Caesar, if Caesar removes the player from their post for running too large a deficit, for going beyond the time frame, for failing to follow Imperial demands, or having the city conquered. Reception Initial reception of the game was positive. Arinn Dembo writing for Computer Gaming World gave the game 4 stars.Dembo, Arinn; The Governor's Race: Building Rome Can Make Your Day in Sierra's Caesar II, p. 304. Computer Gaming World, Issue 138, January 1996 A reviewer for Next Generation deemed it \\"an innovative mix of SimCity-type building strategy and wargame campaign.\\" He said the game's strongest point is how it expands from a city-building simulation into nation-building and wargames, but also highly praised the graphics and simple, easy-to-grasp interface. He scored the game 4 out of 5 stars. Caesar II was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1995 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Command & Conquer and Heroes of Might and Magic (tie). The editors wrote that Caesar II \\"surpassed the original with SVGA graphics and an actual combat module\\", and noted that it \\"could have won had the competition not been so strong.\\" PC Gamer also nominated Caesar II as the best strategy game of 1995, although it lost to Command & Conquer. Caesar II and its predecessor were named, collectively, the 96th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. The editors wrote, \\"Impressions keep on keeping on with the likes of Lords of the Realm [...] but have never managed to regain the dizzy peak they climbed with their handsome brace of think-'em-ups.\\" According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of Caesar and Caesar II surpassed 400,000 units by the end of March 1996. Caesar II alone sold above 500,000 units by late 1998,https://web.archive.org/web/20020826204215/https://www.golem.de/9808/1566.html and ultimately reached 2.5 million sales worldwide.https://web.archive.org/web/20160604010733/https://www.companiesmadesimple.com/project/blog/real- business-case-study-david-lester/ References External links * *Caesar2.com - A fan site Category:1995 video games Category:City-building games Category:DOS games Category:Mac OS games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in antiquity Category:Video games set in the Roman Empire Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games ","title":"Caesar II"},{"id":"2098016","text":"QFD may refer to: *Quality function deployment *Quantum flavordynamics *Question-focused dataset *Boufarik Airport, Algeria * Qufu East railway station, China Railway pinyin code QFD ","title":"QFD"},{"id":"2098026","text":"The Furka Base Tunnel is a Swiss railway base tunnel on the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn's Furka‚ÄìOberalp line, a west-east railway connecting the cantons of Valais and Uri.

The base tunnel is in length, and replaced the previous track that climbed to an apex of above sea level, thus allowing year-round service through service on the Furka‚ÄìOberalp line. The old line has been reopened by the Furka Heritage Railway for tourist trains which pass the Furka Pass via the long Furka Summit Tunnel.

The Furka Base Tunnel is completed by a bypass tunnel around Oberwald.  History  Prior to the opening of the base tunnel, the high-level route closed during the winter months because of heavy snowfall, and large sections of the overhead electrical lines had to be dismantled. In 1976, the Parliament of Switzerland passed a bill for its construction, sponsored by Roger Bonvin, following an initial cost estimate of 76 million francs despite difficult geology. The construction costs, however, had been deliberately lowballed to procure parliamentary support,Wyss, Max (5 March 2019).

The political fighting surrounding the cost overruns are said to have contributed to Roger Bonvin's ill health toward the end of the project and he died just before its opening in 1982. A plaque commemorating Roger Bonvin is installed as the base tunnel's entrance in Oberwald. In its initial year of operation, the base tunnel was used to transport more than 75,000 passenger cars, trucks and buses. Currently, it also serves both an hourly regional train and ten daily Glacier Express trains between Zermatt and the ski resort town of St. Moritz.

It was formed in 1995 as a side project by In Flames' former guitarists Jesper Str√∂mblad and Glenn Ljungstr√∂m. The former Marduk drummer and vocalist Jocke Gothberg joined later on vocals, as well as Hans Nilsson (ex-Liers in Wait, Diabolique, Crystal Age) on drums. The band released Penetrations from the Lost World in 1997 before splitting up the following year. They reformed in 2000, and later recorded Silent Night Fever and This Is Hell. Tours have been rare due to members' other musical commitments. Musically, they have been described as strictly old-school Swedish death metal in the range of At the Gates, Unleashed and Defleshed. Because of Dimension Zero's inception by In Flames' lead guitarist, Jesper Str√∂mblad, their albums have drawn critical comparisons with some of In Flames' earlier work. Their latest album, He Who Shall Not Bleed, was released in 2007. In May 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite for the Gothenburg Sound Festival, which was set to take place in January 2015. In November 2014, a video message from vocalist Jocke on Gothenburg Sound's official Facobook page announced that Dimension Zero had been forced to cancel due to \\"family circumstances\\" and was replaced by Jesper Str√∂mblad's new band The Resistance.

These problems generally arise only in environments that don't have automatic garbage collection.Anthony Williams. C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading. Manning:Shelter Island, 2012. See particularly Chapter 7.2, \\"Examples of lock-free data structures\\". Any lock- free data structure that uses the compare-and-swap primitive must deal with the ABA problem. For example, in a lock-free stack represented as an intrusively linked list, one thread may be attempting to pop an item from the front of the stack (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C). It remembers the second-from-top value \\"B\\", and then performs compare_and_swap(target=&head;, newvalue=B, expected=A). Unfortunately, in the middle of this operation, another thread may have done two pops and then pushed A back on top, resulting in the stack (A ‚Üí C). The compare-and-swap succeeds in swapping \`head\` with \`B\`, and the result is that the stack now contains garbage (a pointer to the freed element \\"B\\"). Furthermore, any lock-free algorithm containing code of the form Node* currentNode = this->head; // assume the load from \\"this->head\\" is atomic Node* nextNode = currentNode->next; // assume this load is also atomic suffers from another major problem, in the absence of automatic garbage collection. In between those two lines, it is possible that another thread may pop the node pointed to by \`this->head\` and deallocate it, meaning that the memory access through \`currentNode\` on the second line reads deallocated memory (which may in fact already be in use by some other thread for a completely different purpose). Hazard pointers can be used to address both of these problems. In a hazard-pointer system, each thread keeps a list of hazard pointers indicating which nodes the thread is currently accessing. (In many systems this \\"list\\" may be probably limited to only one (C++ oriented article) or two elements.) Nodes on the hazard pointer list must not be modified or deallocated by any other thread. When a thread wishes to remove a node, it places it on a list of nodes \\"to be freed later\\", but does not actually deallocate the node's memory until no other thread's hazard list contains the pointer. This manual garbage collection can be done by a dedicated garbage-collection thread (if the list \\"to be freed later\\" is shared by all the threads); alternatively, cleaning up the \\"to be freed\\" list can be done by each worker thread as part of an operation such as \\"pop\\" (in which case each worker thread can be responsible for its own \\"to be freed\\" list). In 2002, Maged Michael of IBM filed an application for a U.S. patent on the hazard pointer technique, but the application was abandoned in 2010. Alternatives to hazard pointers include reference counting.

He was previously known as Mr. KFI and Mr. KABC on account of his radio shows on their respective stations. He currently hosts his own internet radio show, The Marc Germain Show.  Early life and education  Germain was born and raised in Los Angeles, California and was raised mainly in Woodland Hills and Tarzana. From ages 2 through 8, he lived in San Diego near San Diego State University. He graduated from El Camino Real High School. He attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California after being rejected from the University of California, Santa Barbara twice. He was able to transfer to UCSB for his junior year, where he graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1989.  Radio career  = Start in radio = Germain‚Äôs first venture into radio came at the age of twelve in 1979. His father, wanting a hobby for each of his sons bought Germain a ham radio. Taking the amateur radio test twice, he was unable to pass the algebra content of the test due to his age (although he did pass the Morse code portion \\"which was very easy\\"). He was only able to use the radio to receive and not to transmit. However this was also the time of the citizens' band radio boom, so he obtained a citizens' band radio, and was able to acquire a then-necessary license for that. As stated by Germain, he was mostly active on channel 19 and went by the handle of ‚ÄúKing Cobra‚Äù. Archive of podcast from Jan 28, 2010 Timemark 30:18 While completing his degree at UCSB, Germain felt drawn to the business of talk radio. Germain called local radio station KTMS and offered his services to get a break in the radio industry. He was initially rejected, but through UCSB's campus job placement center was able to secure an internship. Within a year and a half, Germain was the assistant program director. = Move to KFI = Germain returned to Los Angeles and landed a job at radio station KFI. After assignments screening phone calls for the station, Germain was given his own weeknight show, Ask Mr. KFI.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Other-Documments/LA-Radio- Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1995-11-12.pdf When KFI moved Phil Hendrie's show into Germain's time slot in 1996, the station offered him a different time slot, which Germain refused and led to him departing KFI. = Mr. KABC = In January 1997 after a 3-month contractually mandated non-competition period, Germain brought his show to KABC as Ask Mr. KABC. As part of promoting his show on the new station, newspaper ads ran in Los Angeles area papers claiming that Mr. KABC had been switched at birth and that explained his time as Mr. KFI. Later he would sometimes be known simply as \\"Mr. K\\". Initially, the show received poor ratings due to inconsistent time slots. The show was frequently preempted by Los Angeles Dodgers games while Germain also spent time filling in as a morning talk show co-host with Brian Whitman. Germain's show began to blossom in March 2000 when KABC management dropped Stephanie Miller's syndicated show and increased the run-time of Ask Mr. KABC from one hour to three hours, occupying the two hours that Miller's show previously held. Germain stated, \\"Her [Miller's] show was cancelled because the station believes that I am a better fit and that my ratings are on the rise.\\" Midway through 2006, KABC pushed the start of his show back an hour to make room for a syndicated show from New York hosted by Mark Levin. In early 2007, KABC wanted to push Germain's show later in the evening for another hour of Levin's show. KABC and Germain couldn't come to an agreement, with Germain citing family considerations, and the two agreed to part ways. = KTLK = It was announced in March 2007 that Germain had joined a revamped KTLK lineup, which had just dropped its Air America affiliation. However, Germain's stint with KTLK was short lived with his show being cancelled in December 2007. = Talk Radio One = In July 2008, Germain launched Talk Radio One, an internet only \\"radio\\" show. At first the shows were \\"Skype-cast\\" and he mainly talked to others around the world via Skype. When Skype ended that aspect of service on September 1, 2008, Germain resorted to a mixture of live shows and podcasts. = Other projects = In November 2008, Germain filled in at KGO. In February 2010, Germain joined Doug McIntyre and Red Eye Radio. The production, a part of Cumulus Media Networks, was heard nationally. The show ended in December 2011 when Cumulus handed the show over to two different hosts.  Personal life  His wife, Ann, is from Long Island, New York. The two met after she hired him to work at KFI. They have been married since July 1992, and have a daughter and a son. Germain and his family left the Los Angeles area and relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada. Germain is the youngest of four sons. His brother, Paul Germain, is an animation screenwriter and producer best known for Rugrats, Recess, and Lloyd in Space.

Similar belts are used by the various Robins, Batgirl, and other members of the Bat-family. History Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox, the first writer other than Bill Finger to write the adventures of Batman in Detective Comics, with introducing the utility belt concept in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939).Daniels, Les. Batman: The Complete History. Chronicle Books, 1999. , pg. 29 In its first appearance, Batman's utility belt \\"contain[ed] choking gas capsules.\\"Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics: \\"The Batman Meets Doctor Death\\" in Detective Comics #29. Retrieved July 31, 2008. Two issues after the utility belt debuted, Fox also wrote the first appearance of a bat-themed weapon, when the batarang debuted in the story \\"Batman vs. the Vampire\\" in Detective Comics #31 (Sep 1939).Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics: \\"Batman vs. the Vampire\\" in Detective Comics #31. Retrieved July 31, 2008. Up until 1989, most artists drew the utility belt as a simple yellow belt with a buckle and capsules/cylinders around it. In 1986, Frank Miller drew Batman's utility belt with military-style pouches in the Batman: The Dark Knight Returns limited series. This rendition was used again in Batman: Year One and used by almost every artist in the Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight comics series. In 2000, the pouches became a standard feature in the depiction of the utility belt. The grapple gun, which fired the Batline/Bat-rope (it had to be thrown manually prior to that), was first introduced in Tim Burton's live-action film, Batman. One feature added to the utility belt in the film and its sequel Batman Returns, was a small motor which would move items from the back of the belt around to the front allowing Batman easier access to his weaponry and tools. Description Although seemingly unremarkable in appearance, the utility belt is one of Batman's most important tools in fighting crime. Consisting primarily of a strap and buckle, the utility belt houses ten pouches or cylindrical cartridges that are attached to the outside of the belt. The buckle itself typically contains a miniature camera and a tape recorder. A secondary compartment behind the length of the belt houses Batman's supply of batarangs. Each of the ten pouches or cylinders contains various tools integral to Batman's war on crime, with the cylinders being interchangeable with each other. Through the years, Batman has modified the contents of his belt to accommodate various crime-fighting scenarios. Most versions of the belt contain security features to prevent anyone other than Batman from opening it. The belt is shown to be able to electrocute any villain who even touches it. It can also release stun gas to prevent tampering. The belt's compartments are locked and only Batman knows how to open them. Contents Elements of the utility belt at times include, but are not limited to, the following: * Batarangs: These are customizable throwing weapons, similar to shurikens, and are collapsible so that a large number of them can fit inside of Batman's utility belt. There are several special varieties of the batarang, aside from the regular type. Explosive batarangs explode once they hit their target. Electric batarangs deliver powerful electric shocks to whatever they come in contact with. These batarangs can incapacitate enemies or overload electronic devices. Remote-controlled batarangs let Batman fully steer the batarang via a remote control. These are used when a straight line of sight isn't possible. These batarangs have cameras in them so that Batman can see where they are going. * Batline/Batrope/Batclaw/Batgrapple: A handheld grappling hook that shoots out a claw-shaped projectile on a retractable high-tensile cord, which grabs onto a surface. Then, this cord pulls Batman to his target. A later boost upgrade launches him high into the air above the target point if he desires (so Batman can glide from there). The hook can also pull down walls, grab enemies and pull them closer, or pull guns straight out of their hands. The hook is secured to the belt magnetically rather than being contained in the belt. It has been portrayed as a portable grappling hook line to be manually thrown onto a higher surface or vantage point for him to climb it to the targeted area. However, in more recent incarnations, his overall grappling gear is composed of a line-launching, gun-like device that shoots the line to pull Batman towards his targeted area or to pull a target towards Batman. A rifle- like grappling gun first appeared in Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1. However, the now standard hand-held version of Batman's grappling gun first appeared in the 1989 Batman film. It gradually replaced the batarang and a rope in the comics after artist Norm Breyfogle introduced a grapple gun in Batman #458 in January 1991. That tool became the standard in the subsequent animated series, comics, films, and video games such as Batman: Arkham Asylum and in Batman: Arkham City a more advanced version called the Grapnel was introduced which could be used to launch Batman into the air to glide using kinetic energy. * Cryptographic sequencer: With this computer-like device, Batman can hack into computer systems, communications frequencies, etc. Seen in the Batman: Arkham video game series. * Bolas: Thrown around the feet of Batman's enemies to tie them with a composite-nylon cord. Often causes an escaping opponent to trip. With the push of a button in Batman's glove it can deliver an electric shock. * Tracers: Used to track enemies Batman cannot follow closely. They also function as miniature listening devices to listen in on conversations from afar. Sometimes fired from a modified pistol. * Smoke pellets: Large amounts of smoke can be deployed by throwing or breaking open these small hardened-gelatin spheroid capsules. Often used to quickly provide cover for Batman's stealthy exits and entries. The lenses in Batman's cowl can see perfectly through the smoke. * Gas pellets: Similar to smoke pellets, gas pellets are used for incapacitating opponents. Lachrymatory, anesthesia, nerve, and regurgitant agents are deployed by breaking open the capsules. A gas filter in the cowl's nose-piece allows Batman to be around the gas unharmed.Batman Annual #19 (1995) * Line launcher: A device that shoots out a steel line in both directions making a zip line, or a tightrope to walk on. Seen in Batman, Batman Returns, Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight. * Tranquilliser gun:Judgement on Gotham (1991) This collapsible gun fires darts that are tipped with fast-acting anaesthesia, paralytic agents, or other chemicals/drugs. In Batman: Year One, this is replaced (or possibly preceded) by a blowpipe kept in one of the boots. * Glue globules: Small round globules of concentrated adhesive glue. They are used to encase enemies in a sticky substance. The globules can be thrown or fired with a small gun. Seen in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, Batman: Arkham Origins and in the webseries Gotham Girls. * Lock pick: This gadget is used to escape handcuffs and access locked rooms. It is rarely kept in the utility belt, more often in one of Batman's gloves. * Rebreather: This cylindrical device allows Batman to breathe underwater or in low oxygen environments. It is very small and compact so it fits easily into the utility belt. The standard rebreather gives 2.5 hours of oxygen. * Laser: A strong miniaturized laser used as a cutting tool. * Pellet grenades: These small explosives are often used to knock down walls. * Concussion mines: These are powerful timed explosives, used for destroying vehicles or blasting out reinforced concrete walls. * Explosive gel: A gel-like substance which can be remotely detonated for an explosion. It is contained in a spray device which also acts as a remote detonator. Seen in Batman: Arkham video games. * Thermite grenades: An incendiary used to burn through obstacles. The fires produced by these grenades are fueled by thermite, and thus are impossible to extinguish and burn at over three times the temperature of molten magma. In Batman: Year One, the thermite charge ignites accidentally and destroys the utility belt. * Napalm: This incendiary gel is kept in delicate packets. Once thrown or broken open, the packets release the napalm gel, which sticks to whatever it comes on contact with and instantly ignites. Seen in the film Batman Returns. * Taser: Used by Batman to stun his enemies with an electrical shock to temporarily paralyze them. * Remote electric charge: This small collapsible gun fires powerful bolts of high current electricity. It is used to incapacitate enemies at long range or overload electronic devices. Seen in the video game Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight. * Stun pellets: Emit bright light and loud sound to completely blind and deafen enemies. The effect wears off in a few minutes, however. Batman is unaffected by these due to his cowl's lenses and sound dampening systems. * EMP gun: Used to disable any electrical equipment. * Disruptor: Batman's disruptor can remotely disable firearms and deactivate explosives. * Remote claw: Confiscated from Deathstroke, this gadget is used to join two objects and pull them together. It works by firing a projectile out which hooks onto an object. The projectile then launches a rope-attached claw, which attaches to a second object. Once both are connected, they are pulled together. Batman can use this to knock enemies together, slam heavy objects into foes, or string objects up. Seen in the video game Batman: Arkham Origins. * Ultrasonic bat beacon: This device emits sonic waves that attract thousands of bats to Batman's location. The bats swarm around him, creating a diversion, as well as sometimes attacking assailants and reinforcing the idea that Batman is a supernatural entity. It is usually kept in the heel of a boot rather than the utility belt. Seen in Batman: Year One and Batman Begins. *Sonic devastator: This small device, when activated, releases high energy sonic waves that can shatter glass and completely incapacitate enemies, making them writhe in agony. It has a range of a few hundred feet. Sound dampening systems built into the cowl leave Batman unaffected. Seen in Batman: The Animated Series and Injustice: Gods Among Us. This device is rarely kept in the utility belt. Rather, it is kept in one of the gloves. * Freeze grenades: Based on technology created by Mr. Freeze, these grenades encase anything in their blast radius in a block of ice. They are useful for freezing enemies to incapacitate them, as well as freezing water to create ice platforms to walk on. Seen in the video game Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight. * Kryptonite: Batman keeps a chunk of kryptonite (in some stories, a ring with a kryptonite gem) in his belt in a lead lined compartment in order to take down any hostile Kryptonians. In the Justice League TV series Batman calls his kryptonite \\"insurance\\", but in some continuities Superman himself gives the kryptonite to him, as a sign of trust. By giving Batman the kryptonite, Superman understands Batman's wariness of his power and trusts Batman to subdue him, should he go astray.

He represented the electoral district of Humber‚ÄîSt. George's‚ÄîSt. Barbe in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1978 and served in the Senate of Canada from 1978 to 1994. History Born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, he was the only officer cadet in the Canadian Army who went ashore at the start of the Battle of Normandy with the 3rd Canadian Division. He served in the North Shore New Brunswick Regiment and would end the war with the rank of Captain. After the war he moved to Corner Brook, Newfoundland where he served with Royal Newfoundland Regiment becoming Colonel and commanding officer for the whole province. After retiring from the military, Marshall managed a drug store in Corner Brook before being elected to parliament in the 1968 federal election. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1978 by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and served until 1994. He also served as the Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Newfoundland Regiment. In 1995, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for his work on Veteran's Affairs. Among his many contributions to Canadian Veterans, he was instrumental in establishing war pensions for members of the Canadian Merchant Navy and in 1994 he led the 50th Anniversary of the D-Day \\"Canada Remembers\\" commemoration. Marshall's son, Tom Marshall was the 11th Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, and was MHA for the district of Humber East and Minister of Finance in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

Richard Lovell Edgeworth (31 May 1744 ‚Äì 13 June 1817) was an Anglo-Irish politician, writer and inventor. Biography Edgeworth was born in Pierrepont Street, Bath, England, son of Richard Edgeworth senior, and great-grandson of Sir Salathiel Lovell through his mother, Jane Lovell, granddaughter of Sir Salathiel. The Edgeworth family came to Ireland in the 1580s. Richard was descended from Francis Edgeworth, Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper, who inherited a fortune from his brother Edward Edgeworth, Bishop of Down and Connor. A Trinity College, Dublin and Corpus Christi, Oxford alumnus, he is credited for creating, among other inventions, a machine to measure the size of a plot of land. He also made strides in the developing educational methods. He anticipated the caterpillar track with an invention that he played around with for forty years but that he never successfully developed. He described it as a \\"cart that carries its own road\\". He was married four times, including both Honora Sneyd and Frances Beaufort, older sister of Francis Beaufort of the Royal Navy. The two men installed a semaphore line for Ireland. Richard Lovell Edgeworth was a member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham. The Lunar Society evolved through various degrees of organization over a period of years, but was only ever an informal group. No constitution, minutes, publications or membership lists survive from any period, and evidence of its existence and activities is found only in the correspondence and notes of those associated with it. Dates given for the society range from sometime before 1760 to it still operating as late as 1813. Fourteen individuals have been identified as having verifiably attended Lunar Society meetings regularly over a long period during its most productive time: these are Matthew Boulton, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Samuel Galton, Jr., James Keir, Joseph Priestley, William Small, Jonathan Stokes, James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood, John Whitehurst and William Withering. Richard Edgeworth and his family lived in Ireland at his estate at Edgeworthstown, County Longford, where he reclaimed bogs and improved roads. He sat in Grattan's Parliament for St Johnstown (County Longford) from 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801, and advocated Catholic Emancipation and parliamentary reform. He was a founder-member of the Royal Irish Academy. He died in Edgworthstown on 13 June 1817.

The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian Territory of Papua. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar≈ç Horii and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of New Guinea Force. The Japanese objective was to seize Port Moresby by an overland advance from the north coast, following the Kokoda Track over the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range, as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States. Japanese forces landed and established beachheads near Gona and Buna on 21 July 1942. Opposed by Maroubra Force, then consisting of four platoons of the 39th Battalion and elements of the Papuan Infantry Battalion, they quickly advanced and captured Kokoda and its strategically vital airfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) 21st Brigade narrowly avoided capture in the Battle of Mission Ridge ‚Äì Brigade Hill from 6 to 8 September. In the Battle of Ioribaiwa from 13 to 16 September, the 25th Brigade under Brigadier Kenneth Eather fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing to Imita Ridge. The Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at Guadalcanal. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well-prepared positions around Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian 7th Division had crossed the Kumusi River at Wairopi, and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at Buna‚ÄìGona held out until 22 January 1943. Australian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few planes available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the Vickers machine gun and medium mortars were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna‚ÄìGona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day. In consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \\"crisis of command\\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the South West Pacific Area, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought‚Äîto the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's Thermopylae and incorporated into the Anzac legend even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect. Background =Strategic context= Japanese attacks along the Malay Barrier 23 December 1941 ‚Äì 21 February 1942. After the fall of Singapore, the Australian government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire 8th Division, deployed to Malaya, Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) was too small to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths. The Militia was mobilised but, although a large force, it was inexperienced and lacked modern equipment. In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the 6th and 7th Divisions of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon, where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942. The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters considered invading Australia in early 1942 but decided against doing so in February that year, as it was judged to be beyond the Japanese capabilities, and no planning or preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States and preventing Allied offensive operations by capturing Port Moresby, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. An attempt to capture Port Moresby by an amphibious assault, Operation Mo, was thwarted by the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942. A month later, most of the Japanese carrier fleet was destroyed in the Battle of Midway, further reducing the possibility of major amphibious operations in the South Pacific. Following this, the Japanese began to consider an overland advance on Port Moresby. General Douglas MacArthur (centre) with General Sir Thomas Blamey (left) and Prime Minister John Curtin (right) in March 1942 Meanwhile, the Allied Supreme Commander in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur set about developing airfields for the defence of Port Moresby, and to strike against the Japanese. The first of these, Operation Boston, was authorised on 20 May and initially planned for the Abau‚ÄìMullins Harbor area. Milne Bay was subsequently determined to be preferable and a garrison force was sent by ship from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip at Merauke, on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank. On 9 June, MacArthur questioned General Sir Thomas Blamey, the commander of Allied Land Forces, as to measures taken for the defence of the overland approach from Buna. This set in train the deployment of forces to Kokoda. MacArthur began to consider the development of an airfield in the Buna area. An initial reconnaissance, landed by flying boat, was conducted on 10 and 11 July. Orders for the airfield construction, Operation Providence, were received by New Guinea Force (NGF) on 17 July, but were postponed by seven days on 18 July, and cancelled following the Japanese landings that shortly followed. = Geography = A map depicting locations along the Kokoda Track In 1942, Papua was a territory of Australia. There had been little development and it was largely devoid of infrastructure beyond that around Port Moresby. The pre-war economy was based primarily upon copra and rubber‚Äîwith plantations established intermittently in coastal regions‚Äîand mining. The administrative centre of Port Moresby had basic airfield and port facilities. There were no roads beyond the vicinity of Port Moresby and, by modern standards, these were little more than tracks. As a result, travel north of Port Moresby was largely undertaken by air, or sea. There were a few landing fields around Port Moresby, with others on the northern side of the Owen Stanley Range at the government stations of Buna and Kokoda. The village of Kokoda is positioned on a plateau in northern foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Range. It overlooks the Yodda Valley (formed by the Mambare River) to its north. The Mambare runs roughly south-east to north-west. Kokoda is approximately direct line from the coastal village of Buna, which formed part of the Japanese beachhead positions occupied on their landing. However, the overland route was approximately . The track to the coast crosses the Kumusi River at Wairopi, approximately east of Kokoda. The river was spanned there by a wire-rope bridge (Wairopi being Pidgin for wire rope). There was a wide track leading from there to the coast which the Japanese subsequently set about developing as a road for vehicle traffic. In 1942, the village was the site of a government station, rubber plantation and strategically important airstrip. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly southwest from Kokoda overland ( in a straight line) through the Owen Stanley Range towards Port Moresby. It was known before the war and had been used as an overland mail route. While there is a \\"main track\\" that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The southern end of the track is now considered to start at Owers' Corner, from Port Moresby. The vehicle track from Port Moresby originally terminated at McDonald's [Corner], where it serviced the McDonald homestead. Between June and late September 1942, around of road was completed, extending it to Owers' Corner. The Kokoda Track passed through what was referred to during the early war years as \\"the (Kokoda) Gap\\". To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts, it potentially offered a corridor from Buna through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources. In reality, the Gap is a dip in the Owen Stanley Range about wide, convenient for aircraft crossing the range to pass through. The track reaches a height of as it passes around the peak of Mount Bellamy. The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to up and down over the full length of the track. This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around Myola. The vegetation is largely dense jungle. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level, resulting in fog. Myola is close to the watershed. A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed. On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek. It follows along the side of the steep valley formed by the creek. It crosses the creek from one side to the other at several points along its course. From Deniki, the track descends to the Kokoda plateau. =Disease= Tents of the 2/4th Field Ambulance near Efogi (AWM P02423.011) Operations in New Guinea were impacted by tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, scrub typhus, tropical ulcers, dysentery from a range of causes and fungal infections. Walker observes that the Kokoda Track \\"starts and ends with malaria\\". Malarial vectors were substantially absent from the cooler, higher elevations along the track. Most cases observed in these areas were relapses rather than primary infections. The immediate vicinity of Port Moresby is relatively dry. While this tends to mitigate the risk of malaria, significant rates of the disease were observed in troops, mainly militia, sent to New Guinea for defence of the port, leading up to the campaign. The risk from malaria was particularly high for troops operating in the coastal area around the southern end of the track and when the Australian forces had been forced back to Imita Ridge. AIF units returning from the Middle East were more aware of the threat this disease posed and arrived with supplies of quinine. For these reasons, the disease did not have the same degree of significance or impact on operations as it did at Milne Bay or the subsequent operations at Buna‚ÄìGona. Anderson recounts the prevalence of dysentery among Australian troops, while James reports that \\"more and more [Japanese] succumbed\\" to diseases, including dysentery, as they withdrew along the track. Walker attributes enteric infections to poor field hygiene, contaminated and unpurified water, and a failure to make adequate sanitary provisions along the track during the early part of the campaign. He also identifies that a proportion of diarrhoeal disturbances were attributable to the poor diet (particularly the high-fat content of tinned beef) rather than infection. =Japanese forces= The Japanese 17th Army under Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake was a corps-sized command, based at Rabaul, involved in the New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and Solomon Islands campaigns. Following Coral Sea, the 17th Army considered an overland advance on Port Moresby. This was based on pre-war intelligence that a road existed linking it with Kokoda. Initial aerial reconnaissance was inconclusive but plans were made for a reconnaissance in force and to exploit the possibility of an advance along such a route. The 15th Independent Engineer Regiment (less one company) and the South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar≈ç Horii were assigned to these tasks. At the time, Horii was unenthusiastic as to the possibility of success, in consideration of the logistical difficulties that would be faced, but he did not press his objection. An advance party, under command of Colonel Yokoyama Yosuke of the 15th Independent Engineer Regiment was to consist of the main force of the regiment, the 1st Battalion of the 144th Infantry Regiment, and the 1st Company, 1st Battalion of the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment. It also included 500 Korean and Formosan labourers and 2,000 native labourers from Rabaul. A naval force based on the 5th Yokosuka Naval Landing Party was to land at the same time as the advance party and commence construction of an airfield at Buna. Japanese planning proceeded on the premise that an overland assault would occur. The wreck of Ayotosan Maru, a transport which was sunk during the initial landing shortly after disembarkation (AWM014868) The initial landing took place from the evening of 21 July 1942. An infantry company was immediately dispatched towards Kokoda. A second component of the Yokoyama landing party arrived on 29 July. The landing was reinforced by successive convoys over the following weeks. The main force of the 144th Infantry Regiment landed on 18 August. The 41st Infantry Regiment (less 1st Battalion) landed on 21 August, with the 1st Battalion landing on 27 August. Horii linked up with the advance party at Kokoda and began to assemble his force for the overland advance. By 26 August, it consisted of the 144th Infantry Regiment (three battalions), the 41st Infantry Regiment (2nd and 3rd Battalions, with the 1st Battalion yet to arrive‚Äîjoining the main force on 14 September) and 1st Battalion, 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 3rd Battalion was tasked with protecting the force's line-of-communication. The 41st Infantry Regiment fielded only 1,900 troops since both the 1st and 3rd Battalions had approximately 400 detached from each for road construction and supply tasks. The force has been estimated at 6,000. Horii commenced his advance with each man carrying sixteen days' rations. Troops of both regiments were seasoned veterans. The 41st Infantry Regiment had fought against Australians in Malaya. =Australian forces= The Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea formed the 8th Military District of Australia (subsequently designated New Guinea Force) under command of Brigadier Basil Morris. As war in the Pacific approached, there were two local militia units: the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) and the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles. With growing tensions, the 49th Battalion was sent to Port Moresby in March 1941. On 3 January 1942, the 49th Battalion was joined by the 39th and 53rd Battalions under command of the 30th Brigade. At the end of May, the force protecting Port Moresby was increased by the 14th Brigade, consisting of the 3rd, 36th and 55th Battalions. The militia units were considered poorly trained, though some effort was taken to infuse them with experienced junior officers, most of their time in New Guinea was spent labouring rather than training. Morale in the 53rd Battalion was particularly low. A draft, numbering about one hundred, was drawn from other militia units on short notice. With embarkation in late December, they were denied Christmas leave. Destined for North Queensland they were diverted to New Guinea en route. The disaffection undermined morale and has been cited as a significant factor in respect of the battalion's subsequent performance. 2/16th Battalion, 7th Division, fuzing Mills bombs, Damour, during the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign. The division had also seen service in North Africa before being recalled to Australia. (AWM008641) As well as defending Port Moresby, New Guinea Force commanded operations against the Japanese landings around Wau, that occurred on 8 March 1942, and was commencing development of an air base at Milne Bay. The 7th Division of the 2nd AIF was poised to deploy to New Guinea‚Äîits 21st and 25th Brigades would be assigned to the defence of Port Moresby, while its 18th Brigade would be sent to Milne Bay. On 12 June 1942, Morris ordered the PIB to patrol a wide area of the north coast around: Ioma, located approximately north-northeast of Kokoda; Awala, between Kokoda and Gona; and, Tufi, on Cape Nelson ‚Äì with headquarters at Kokoda. The battalion, commanded by Major William Watson, consisted of three companies with a total strength of 310, including 30 Europeans ‚Äì mainly officers and senior non-commissioned officers. Its role was reconnaissance. There were indications of Japanese plans to land in the vicinity of Buna. On 22 June Morris received orders from LHQ to deploy \\"Australian infantry\\" to Kokoda for the forward defence of Port Moresby. About the middle of July, GHQ was planning Operation Providence for development of an airstrip in the vicinity of Buna. When orders were issued to Morris for the Providence operation on 17 July, he intended to use the 39th Battalion as the force required under the plan to garrison the Buna area. The initial deployment of the 39th Battalion had an entirely different aim though. Author, Eustace Keogh, clarifies this: On 23 June, an initial order was given for a company of the 39th Battalion to deploy to Kokoda with the possibility of it being joined by the rest of the battalion. This was amended on 24 June for deployment of the battalion (less one company). The instrument for this was NGF Operational Instruction 18. It placed the PIB under command of the 39th Battalion. It also assigned detachments of service units in support. Attachments were placed under command of Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, commanding officer of the 39th Battalion. \\"Maroubra\\" was assigned as the code word. An advance party, the battalion's B Company, assembled at Illolo. Departing on 8 July, it arrived at Kokoda on 15 July. As a code word, \\"Maroubra\\" continued to be used throughout the campaign to refer to operations along the track and the Australian forces deployed forward‚Äîeven though references to \\"Maroubra Force\\" in sources is somewhat enigmatic. The Japanese landings around Buna and Gona saw B Company of the 39th Battalion in position at Kokoda and C Company advancing along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move and most of the battalion had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Campaign =Overview= Captain Thomas Grahamslaw of the ANGAU and Sergeant-Major Katue of the PIB, October 1942. Grahamslaw was at Buna when the Japanese landed. (AWM127566) In the early evening of 21 July 1942, Japanese troops landed close to Gona. The Japanese advance party moved rapidly towards Kokoda, reaching the Kumusi, at Wairopi in the afternoon of 23 July. The PIB and Australians engaged the advancing Japanese with ambushes. B Company, 39th Battalion assembled a force (including what remained of the PIB) to make a stand near Oivi on 26 July. One platoon remained at Kokoda. Threatened with encirclement, the force at Oivi withdrew south to Deniki. Having lost contact, the platoon at Kokoda also withdrew to Deniki on 27 July. With the force reassembled, it reoccupied the village unopposed on 28 July. The first battle at Kokoda was fought over 28‚Äì29 July. Repeated, determined attacks caused the Australians to withdraw to Deniki. Owen, commanding officer of the 39th Battalion, was mortally wounded in the fighting. There was a pause in the Japanese advance. Remaining companies of the 39th Battalion arrived overland and Major Allan Cameron, Brigade Major of the 30th Brigade was appointed to assume command of the force. He planned an attack for 8 August towards Kokoda, with three companies advancing on different lines. Two of the companies were held up and forced to retire. A Company was able to occupy Kokoda but, isolated and under attack, it withdrew during the night of 9 August. Companies of the 39th Battalion had withdrawn to Deniki by 12 August and were attacked the following morning. With the threat of envelopment, the battalion commenced to withdraw towards Isurava on the morning of 14 August. Meanwhile, the 53rd Battalion and headquarters 30th Brigade under Brigadier Selwyn Porter were sent as reinforcements. Two battalions of the 2nd AIF's 21st Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts were following. A defensive position was established by Porter at Isurava with the 30th Brigade to be relieved by the 21st Brigade force. As Potts' lead battalion approached, he took command of the combined force to effect the relief. However, the Japanese advance overtook events and, from 26 to 31 August, a battle ensued in which four Japanese battalions were committed. The 53rd Battalion failed to secure the eastern flank and, with the Japanese taking a commanding position to the Australian front, ultimately forced an Australian withdrawal. The 21st Brigade then fought a series of engagements between 31 August and 5 September as it withdrew from Eora Village to Templeton's Crossing. Officers of 30th Brigade, July 1942.

Findlay. (AWM 025958) The Japanese had landed at Milne Bay on 25 August but, as the Australian position there firmed, the third battalion of Potts' 21st Brigade was released to join the fighting along the track. With this reinforcement, he determined to make a stand on Mission Ridge, running forward from Brigade Hill. In fighting from 6 to 9 September, two battalions of the brigade withdrew, narrowly avoiding encirclement while the 2/27th Battalion was feared lost until its remnants emerged from the jungle three weeks later. Following the battle, Potts was recalled to Port Moresby, with Porter being placed in command. The depleted 21st Brigade was withdrawn to Ioribaiwa Ridge. It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion and awaited relief by the 25th Brigade, under command of Eather. Eather took command of the combined force but the Japanese attacked just as his battalions were taking up position‚Äîwith fighting over the period 14 to 16 September. He obtained permission to withdraw and consolidate at Imita Ridge‚Äîthe final defensive position along the Track. Meanwhile, American forces had landed at Guadalcanal on 7 August. Unable to support both operations, Horii was ordered to withdraw. When Eather attacked the Japanese positions on 28 September, he found them abandoned. The Australian forces cautiously pursued the Japanese withdrawal. The 16th Brigade was committed to the advance and direct command passed to the 7th Division, under Major General Arthur \\"Tubby\\" Allen. The 25th Brigade took the vanguard. On 10 October, Myola was occupied unopposed and contact was made with the Japanese defence. The 25th Brigade was held up at Templeton's Crossing from 16 October until the 16th Brigade pushed through on 20 October and advanced towards Eora Village. Here, the advance was held until the Japanese forces withdrew on 28 October. Pressured to hasten the advance by MacArthur, Allan was replaced by Major General George Vasey on 28 October. The 7th Division advanced towards Kokoda and, when a patrol reported it unoccupied, it was retaken on 2 November. A further battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari from 4 to 11 November. Vasey was able to turn the flank and rout the Japanese. On 15 November, the 7th Division crossed the Kumusi River and commenced its advance towards the beachheads at Buna‚ÄìGona. =Reasons for Japanese withdrawal= US Marines at Guadalcanal As the Kokoda Track campaign was taking place, a Japanese invasion force made up of Japanese Special Naval Landing Force units attempted to capture the strategically valuable Milne Bay area on the eastern tip of New Guinea in August 1942. The Battle of Milne Bay, fought from 25 August to 7 September 1942, resulted in a Japanese defeat. This was the first notable Japanese land defeat and raised Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre. Allied forces identified a Japanese airfield under construction at Guadalcanal, and 19,000 US Marines were embarked to capture the airfield. An amphibious landing was made on 7 August. The battle lasted until 9 February 1943 and was strongly contested, on land, at sea and in the air. Hyakutake's initial thrust on 14 September to re-take the island's Henderson Field was defeated. In an unequal battle, Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi's forces lost about 850 killed, while the American Marines lost 104. When the news reached Imperial General Headquarters in Japan, they decided in an emergency session that they could not support fronts in both New Guinea and at Guadalcanal. Hyakutake decided that he only had sufficient troops and material to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal. He prepared to send more troops to Guadalcanal in another attempt to recapture the airfield. With the concurrence of the Japanese command staff, he ordered Horii to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided. The Japanese troops were, after several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses, at Ioribaiwa, within of Port Moresby. There were also concerns that Allied forces might land at Buna at any time. An emaciated Japanese prisoner capture near Menari as the Australians advanced (AWM027085) Bullard, in the introduction to his translation observes: These instructions to halt the advance appear to date from as early as 16 August: \\"Senior Japanese officers interviewed after the war thought that the factor most influencing the postponement was not Guadalcanal but rather 'stronger than anticipated Australian resistance at Kokoda.'\\" Bullard reports orders to Horii of 28 August, \\"[to] advance to the southern slopes of the Owen Stanley Range ... but amass your main strength on the north side of the range in preparation for future operations\\". Bullard notes a degree of ambiguity with respect to defining the \\"southern slopes\\". On 8 September, the 17th Army ordered Horii to assemble the 41st Regiment in the Kokoda area. Horii did draw back the main body of his force but continued to thrust forward. When, on the 19 September, Hyakutake became aware that Ioribaiwa had been occupied on 16 September, he \\"issued strict orders for front-line troops to immediately occupy a position to the north of Mawai\\". An order of 23 September was to secure the Isurava‚ÄìKokoda area as \\"a base for future operations\\". Horii had out-run his supply line and therefore his force was faced with extreme rationing and was unable to advance any further. On 24 September, the 2nd/144th Battalion withdrew from Ioribaiwa. The 3rd/144th Battalion formed the rearguard and withdrew during the night of 26 September. =Logistics= Troops load ammunition wrapped in blankets to be airdropped. Blamey displays a keen interest AWM013836 Allied logistics This campaign and the battle that followed at the Japanese beachheads around Buna and Gona were defined, for both sides, by the limitations imposed by terrain and the capability to supply and maintain their forces under the conditions they faced. Morris said to Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell on handing over command of NGF, \\"The mountains will beat the Nips and we must be careful they don‚Äôt beat us.\\" Substantially devoid of infrastructure, Morris had set about an ongoing programme to expand, improve and develop harbour and airfield facilities at Port Moresby. Opened in early October, a T-shaped wharf was constructed on Tatana Island. It more than doubled the capacity of the port. Under orders from GHQ, an airfield and subsequent port facilities were developed at Milne Bay. This saw Allied forces fortuitously placed to counter the Japanese landing that occurred there. Roads were virtually non-existent. In concert with orders to deploy Maroubra Force to Kokoda, Lieutenant Bert Kienzle was ordered to construct an overland road for its resupply. Historian Peter Brune describes it as \\"one of the most ludicrous\\" orders ever given. Just over of road was completed by the end of September 1942, from McDonald's to Owers' Corner. Kienzle guided Templeton's B Company of the 39th Battalion across the track to Kokoda. As they went, Kienzle identified staging points along the track and made arrangements for provisioning them. When they arrived at Kokoda, food was running low. Kienzle made a brief visit to his homestead in the Yodda Valley and returned with supplies. The trek was considered too arduous for the soldiers to carry any heavy equipment. Arrangements had been made for a coastal vessel to transport supplies and other equipment to Buna. It was unloaded the day prior to the Japanese commencing their landings at Basabua, northward around the coast, near Gona. While Kokoda was held, it was possible to resupply by air landing. Owen flew into Kokoda to take command on 24 July. On 26 July, a platoon of D Company was landed. Lacking serviceable aircraft, this was done in two lifts by a single plane. Having returned overland, Kienzle made a report on the supply situation. A porter could carry a load equivalent to 13 days' rations. If he carried rations for a soldier, between them, they would consume the load in 6¬Ω days. This made no allowance for ammunition, other necessary equipment or the porter's return. The trek to Kokoda was 8 days. He concluded that operations could not be sustained without large scale air drops occurring. Aerial resupply commenced with drop sites at Kagi and Efogi but neither site was particularly suitable. Significant quantities fell outside the drop zone and could not be recovered. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. Recognising that a better drop zone was needed, Kienzle set out on 1 August, to find a large open area he recalled having seen from the air. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds near the crest of the range, which he called Myola. Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola. Access to this large area alleviated the proportion of supplies lost to the jungle. It also made the task of carriers achievable. He set about establishing it as a supply camp and cut a new track towards Eora Creek. It joined the existing track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named. Papuan carriers with a two-man load, moving along the track (AWM013002) While the discovery of Myola alleviated one of the problems associated with resupply, it did not solve them all. Air drops requested during the second battle at Kokoda were delayed by weather‚Äîwhich frequently interfered with air operations over the range. At the start of the campaign, effective air dropping techniques had not been developed. Belated drops to Kokoda were made by fighters because of the lack of transports. Belly tanks were filled with supplies but this could not be widely used. Parachutes were not initially available and, after a quantity were delivered in mid-September, remained in short supply and were reserved for essential equipment. Most supplies were \\"free dropped\\". Packaging was primitive by modern standards. Supplies were wrapped in blankets or tied in sacks. There was, however, a conscious choice to utilise packing, such as blankets, that were required by the troops and might otherwise have been supplied separately. The rate of breakage and loss was high‚Äîon average, 50 per cent and up to 90 per cent. Lieutenant Fayle, Allen's aide-de-camp, commented that: \\"The whole fact of the matter, and NGF seemed unable to understand all through the campaign, was that recoveries were never 100 per cent of the supplies dropped and wastage was at times terrific.\\" The lack of transport aircraft was another constraint. On 5 August, the only two aircraft available for supply work returned to Australia. On 17 August, a Japanese air raid on Port Moresby destroyed five aircraft and severely damaged eleven others when the aircraft had been parked close together. Of these, seven transports (later dubbed \\"biscuit bombers\\") were destroyed or put out of commission, leaving only one in service. This report by Gillison is indicative since there is considerable variation in the sources as to the number and type of planes damaged and destroyed. What is clear is that this was a disastrous event that significantly curtailed the Allied capacity to resupply the troops fighting along the track. Moremon says that no aircraft were available for dropping until 23 August while McCathy states this as 22 August. Given the tenuous supply situation, this was a significant break. Civilian aircraft and pilots were pressed into service in an effort to meet demand. They were mainly used in flights between Australia and New Guinea or in rear areas in order to release military planes and personnel for service in forward areas but this did not solve the immediate problem. Mules and pack horses being led past a 25-pounder being hauled forward on the first leg of the track from Owers' Corner (AWM027023) Potts' two battalions commenced their advance along the track on the basis that 40,000 rations plus ammunition and other supplies had been stockpiled at Myola and additional supplies existed at staging points along the route. Potts arrived at Myola on 21 August to find only 8,000 rations (five days' reserve) and a further two days' reserve forward. Potts was forced to hold his force at Myola until a sufficient reserve could be accumulated‚Äîwhich impacted his conduct of the battle at Isurava (commencing 26 August). The \\"missing\\" rations have been the subject of investigation‚Äîboth at the time and subsequently. Dudley McCarthy, the Australian official historian, concluded that the reason most likely lay in \\"faulty [staff] work by inexperienced staff\\". Rowell's investigation, made at the time, determined that the rations had been dispatched. The second and much larger, dry lake bed, Myola 2, was discovered by a patrol on 21 August. At this time, maps showed and air crew expected only one. John Moremon hypothesises that drops were likely made at the wrong one. Rowell noted in his memoirs that \\"all through the New Guinea Campaign cargo dropping remained notoriously unreliable\\". An airdrop over Myola (AWM P02424.071) In consequence of this short-fall and the earlier loss of transports at Port Moresby, urgent requests were forwarded by Rowell through the chain-of-command. Transport aircraft in the theatre at this time were largely operated by the Fifth Air Force, with Major General George Kenney commanding Allied Air Forces. MacArthur released six Douglas Dauntless dive bombers, one B-17 Flying Fortress and two transports. He noted that, at the time, there were only thirty transport planes in Australia and, of these, only 50 per cent were available at any one time. His response stated that the resources being made available should be sufficient for the of supplies necessary to supply forces at Wau and along the track (as estimated by Rowell) each day. The figure supplied by Rowell explicitly did not allow for any reserve to be established. MacArthur concluded by saying: When Potts asked for some additional 800 labourers to help alleviate the supply situation, Rowell replied that only 300 could be provided. There was simply not the labour force available to establish a reserve. As Allen was advancing, he estimated that he required 3,000 carriers to support his operations forward of Myola but in late October, there were only 1,250 forward of Myola and none to the rear. During the Australian advance, Myola 2 was developed as the major resupply point. A strip was developed there, being a larger area, but it was considered too risky for general use. A US Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport plane dropping supplies to the Australian 25th Brigade near Nauro Village in October 1942 As Potts withdrew from Isurava, Myola was lost‚Äîhis force destroying anything usable as it left. Successive withdrawals towards the start of the track eased the supply burden. As Allen advanced, following the withdrawing Japanese forces, he was acutely aware of the logistical problems facing his force. He faced pressure from Blamey and MacArthur to advance his forces without being able to assure their supply. His reluctance to do so was a significant factor leading to his replacement. McCarthy observes: \\"There was little that General Vasey could add immediately to General Allen's planning.\\" Japanese logistics Australian troops clearing grass and obstacles from the airstrip at Kokoda. The Japanese failed to take advantage of the strip. (AWM151044) Initial Japanese reconnaissance had indicated a trafficable road to Kokoda. Bullard reports the error in this. While the road was improved for vehicle transport to Sonobo, about halfway from Gona to Wairopi, levies from Rabaul and pack- horses would have to carry supplies the remaining distance to Kokoda and further forward. Meanwhile, allied airpower interfered with the Japanese line- of-communication, particularly at the Kumusi River, making it uncrossable by day. Soldiers advanced from Kokoda carrying 16 days' rations. The advance, from the end of July until Ioribaiwa, in mid September was to last for over forty-five days. Their load included ammunition for the artillery and machine guns as well as of rice per man. A convoy carrying four independent supply companies destined to arrive at Buna on 20 September was delayed: \\"The mechanism for maintaining supply for the South Seas Force was broken.\\" By the time the Japanese had advanced to Ioribaiwa, there was extreme rationing and the daily rice ration had been reduced to per day without the prospect of captured stores alleviating the difficulty. Horii's force was unable to advance further. As the Japanese withdrew, it was found that many of the enemy had died of malnutrition with evidence that some Japanese had been reduced to eating wood, grass, roots and other inedible material. Australian soldiers were also confronted with evidence of cannibalism. Dead and wounded Australian and Japanese soldiers who had been left behind in the Australian retreat from Templeton's Crossing were stripped of flesh. In 1987, a Japanese documentary Yuki Yuki te Shingun contained interviews with Japanese soldiers who confessed to cannibalism in New Guinea. The evidence of cannibalism inflamed and angered the feelings of the Australians towards their adversaries. The Japanese made little use of aerial resupply; an exception recorded is the drop of supplies at Kokoda on 23 September. When Australian forces reoccupied Kokoda, they found the strip there overgrown and unused. Papuan labour Papuan carriers in Australian service crossing a river between Nauro and Menari in October 1942 The pre-war plantation economy of the Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea was based on a system of indentured labour. On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort. While resupply of the Australian forces on the track would have collapsed without airdrops, the native carrier force remained an essential component, moving supplies forward from the drop zones under arduous conditions. Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon wrote of the conditions endured: \\"The condition of our carriers at Eora Creek caused me more concern than that of the wounded ... Overwork, overloading ... exposure, cold and underfeeding were the common lot. Every evening scores of carriers came in, slung their loads down and lay exhausted on the ground.\\" On their return, they would carry back the wounded with care: for which they have been mythologised as the \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\\". There are many testaments of praise for the care rendered. In relation to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that \\"the men on the stretchers ...[were] ... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse\\", while Frank Kingsley Norris recounted that, \\"if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available‚Äîregardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly\\".Quoted in . The carrier force under command of Kienzle supporting the Australian advance is reported at over 1,600. The total number that worked on the track was significantly larger, with attrition through desertion and sickness. Author Paul Ham estimates a total of up to 3,000 and claims a desertion rate of 30 per cent. The ever- increasing need for labour impacted on the communities from which they were conscripted by reducing the capacity for food production. The Japanese also relied on native labour to transport supplies for their forces on the Kokoda Track. Around 2,000 indentured workers were transported to the mainland from Rabaul, and a further 300 residents of the north coast of Papua were recruited. These labourers were poorly treated, and suffered from overwork. Many carriers who became sick or injured were murdered by Japanese forces. This mistreatment caused high desertion rates among the Papuan carriers. As the Japanese had difficulty obtaining replacement carriers, the casualties and desertions contributed to shortfalls in the quantities of supplies which reached the combat troops. Medical A Stinson L-1 Vigilant air ambulance operating at Kokoda, November 1942 (AWM P02424.085) When the 21st Brigade joined the fighting early in the campaign, the medical plan was for evacuation forward to Kokoda, and there, by air, on the premise that it would soon be recaptured. This was discarded as it quickly became apparent that this would not happen and any serious casualties were moved back toward Myola. Potts had requested air evacuation but this was refused for a lack of suitable aircraft. As Myola was threatened by the Japanese advance, the casualties gathered there had to be evacuated to the head of the track. The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with \\"absolute ruthlessness\\" and not provided with stretchers. In one case, a casualty with a severely fractured patella (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded. As the Australians advanced back along the track to Kokoda, Myola again became the main evacuation point. Aircraft were sent from Australia and approximately 40 patients were evacuated by air before a Ford Trimotor and a single-engined Stinson of unspecified model both crashed and further air evacuation from Myola was suspended. With the recapture of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation could occur from its landing strip and it became the main point of evacuation. As well as C‚Äì47s landing with supplies, Stinson L-1 Vigilant light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda. At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded. Many walked back along the track as they became sufficiently well to make the trek. Some had to wait up to two-and-a-half months before porters were available to carry the stretcher cases forward to Kokoda for evacuation by air. The last arrived at Port Moresby only a couple of days before Christmas. Norris later wrote and questioned: \\"why after three years of war no adequate ambulance planes were available\\"? =Heavy weapons= Members of 14th Field Regiment firing a captured 75 mm Type 41 regimental gun ‚Äì 1944 (AWM072161) Bullard reports that, while the munitions of the 144th Regiment were limited by what they could carry, this included eighteen [medium] machine guns (Type 92 Juki), three battalion (infantry) guns, two rapid-fire guns and two regimental artillery guns. The mountain artillery battalion deployed with three companies servicing a gun each, while leaving one gun in reserve at Buna. The 44th Regiment deployed with thirteen medium machine guns, three battalion guns, one regimental gun and one rapid-fire gun. Anderson indicates that the regimental and mountain artillery battalion guns were of the 75 mm Type 41, while the infantry guns were of the 70 mm Type 92. By virtue that the 37 mm guns were described as \\"rapid fire\\", these were most likely the dual-purpose Type 94 anti-tank gun which was a rapid-fire gun, as distinct from the earlier Type 11 37 mm infantry gun. It employed an automatic cartridge ejection and was capable of firing up to 30 rounds per minute. Primarily a direct-fire weapon, using telescopic sights, it had an effective range of and could be broken down into four loads of . The Type 92 battalion gun was a 70 mm light howitzer capable of direct and indirect fire. It had an effective range of , firing a high-explosive projectile of . The Type 41 was a mountain gun capable of firing a high-explosive projectile to a maximum range of . It could be broken down into eleven units of not more than . The Australian brigade structure included a regiment of artillery, consisting of two batteries, each equipped with twelve Ordnance QF 25-pounder guns. These had a range of but weighed and were not intended to be broken down into pack loads. As the Japanese advance threatened Imita Ridge the 14th Field Regiment (less one battery) deployed to near the head of the track to defend against a break-out by the Japanese into more open country. Two guns were hauled to Owers' Corner by caterpillar tractor. On 20 September, they shelled the Japanese positions at Ioribaiwa from a range of . A third gun was stripped down and man-handled forward, taking 50 men five days to move it just through the mountainous jungle terrain. However, by time they were in position and ready to fire the Japanese were out of range. 1st Mountain Battery was raised and a gun flown to Kokoda. A gun of the battery is shown here in action near Buna. (AWM013973) In response to the situation, the 1st Mountain Battery was raised and equipped with 3.7-inch pack howitzers hastily obtained from the Royal New Zealand Navy. Initially it was intended that the guns would be moved by pack horse; however, following the unit's arrival in Port Moresby in early October it soon became clear that horses would be unsuited to the humid conditions in New Guinea with the guns to be moved by jeeps and native carriers instead. It took about 90 porters to move one gun without ammunition. The battery did not take part in the fighting along the track but on 15 November, a detachment with one gun was flown into Kokoda to support the Australian 7th Division. An Australian infantry battalion had a mortar platoon with four Ordnance ML 3-inch mortars, capable of throwing a round . Battalions also had access to the Vickers medium machine gun. The Vickers, while water cooled, was of similar weight and capability to the Juki employed by the Japanese. When Australian forces deployed forward, neither of these weapons were carried. It was considered that they were too heavy to be carried and that they could not be effectively employed in jungle terrain. A post action report by the 2/14th Battalion identified that it was a mistake not to take these weapons forward. By the time of the Battle of Brigade Hill‚ÄìMission Ridge (from about 6 September), the 21st Brigade was operating a section of three 3-inch mortars that had been parachuted into Myola. When the Australians commenced the advance from Imita Ridge, most battalions moving forward carried a 3-inch mortar with twenty-four bombs and one Vickers machine gun with 3,000 rounds. Despite this increased fire-power, the Japanese still held a significant advantage by quantity and range. McCarthy recounts instances where Australian mortars and Vickers machine guns brought into service were quickly targeted and taken out by Japanese artillery. There was also a high rate of misfires with mortar ammunition that had been airdropped and, after such a round exploded in the barrel and killed the crew, the use of airdropped mortar ammunition was suspended by the 16th Brigade. The Japanese carried into the mountains thirteen artillery pieces and employed fifteen in the Battle of Oivi‚ÄìGorari at the end of the campaign. While Anderson reports that approximately 940 men were responsible for carrying the guns, ammunition and other paraphernalia across the Owen Stanleys, he concludes that, despite this burden: \\"Throughout the Kokoda campaign the Japanese held one distinct advantage over the Australians: artillery. The Japanese use of artillery pieces in each Kokoda battle was a force multiplier, and the Australians were never able to match the Japanese ranged weapons.\\" He attributes around 35 per cent of the Australian casualties to the Japanese artillery but observes that the effect upon morale was perhaps of equal significance: \\"The helplessness felt by the men who were subjected to relentless bombardment without the means to retaliate sapped both their number and their spirit.\\" Williams asserts that: \\"Japanese artillery provided an important, perhaps decisive, role on the battlefields of the Kokoda Track.\\" Other equipment Radio set operated by Signalman James Pashley (AWM P02038.146) Australian soldiers initially entered battle wearing a khaki uniform which contrasted with the darker greens of the jungle. Moreover, webbing of the 21st Brigade had been bleached white from their service in Syria. In contrast, the Japanese wore a green uniform more suited to the jungle environment and were adept at camouflage. By the time the 25th Brigade was committed to the fighting, it was wearing jungle green‚Äîalbeit that these were khaki uniforms that had been quickly dyed. This dye ran and caused skin complaints among the wearers. Much of the Australian equipment was standardised across the British army and the Commonwealth. This imperial legacy meant a force structure intended for fighting in open country and which was highly reliant on motor transport. Consequently, weight was not so much a consideration where equipment was not intended to be man-packed. The 109 radio set and associated equipment required nineteen carriers to transport, were temperamental as a result of the \\"excessive handling\\" and were susceptible to moisture and humidity. In contrast, the Japanese used compact wireless sets and lightweight aluminium signal wire. Captured stocks of Mills bombs (model 36M) were valued by the Japanese. The lever and striker mechanism of the Mills bomb was considered superior to their own service grenade, the Type 99, which had to be struck on a hard object to ignite the fuze immediately before throwing. =Air operations= A USAAF Bell P-39 Airacobra and ground crew, Port Moresby, August 1942 (AWM025894) Apart from the significant logistical contribution in support of the Australian forces, air operations included bombing missions against Rabaul, the Japanese base supporting the landings in Papua, and the attempts to resupply and reinforce the beachheads around Buna and Gona. Bombers were based in Australia, staging through Port Moresby‚Äîresulting in considerable crew fatigue. Bombing sorties also targeted the beachheads, particularly the airfield being constructed at Buna, and the Japanese line of communication. Regular missions against Buna effectively neutralised the airfield‚Äîdamaging it almost as fast as it could be repaired, thereby rendering it ineffective. The crossing of the Kumusi at Wairopi was regularly targeted and bridging works repeatedly destroyed. The Australian forces on the track called for bombing and strafing missions in support of operations on several occasions but such requests were not always fulfilled. Weather conditions across the range constantly interfered with operations. =Allied command= New Guinea. October 1942. A tea break at a canteen in the forward areas during a tour of inspection by US General, Douglas MacArthur. In the background, left to right, are: Major General G. S. Allen, Commander, Australian 7th Division AIF; Mr F. M. Forde, Australian Minister for the Army; General MacArthur, Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area; and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander, Allied Land Forces AWM150836 MacArthur, after being ordered to leave the Philippines, arrived in Australia on 17 March 1942 and was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). MacArthur had to compete with Admiral Chester Nimitz's plan to drive towards Japan through the central Pacific. Ambitious, he was concerned that his command should not be sidelined. Blamey had been recalled from the Middle East, arriving in Australia on 23 March 1942. Shortly after, he was appointed as commander-in-chief of the Australian Army and subsequently, to the separate position, which he simultaneously held, of commander, allied land forces SWPA. Papua and New Guinea had been the Australian 8th Military District under command of Morris. On 9 April 1942, it was formed into New Guinea Force, with Morris promoted major general. As events escalated and the forces involved increased, Rowell arrived from Australia with HQ I Corps, taking command of the force on 12 August 1942. Morris was moved to command the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU). At about this time, 7th Division was deploying to New Guinea and responsibility for the immediate defence of Port Moresby, including Maroubra Force and the Kokoda Track operation was devolved to divisional headquarters under Allan. Both Blamey's Allied Land Headquarters (LHQ) and MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) were increasingly alarmed by the situation on the track, with Australian forces suffering a series of reversals, and by the Japanese landings at Milne Bay (this battle was fought from 25 August to 7 September 1942). Vasey, then Blamey's deputy chief of the general staff, wrote privately to Rowell on 1 September, that \\"GHQ is like a bloody barometer in a cyclone‚Äîup and down every two minutes\\". MacArthur also had a poor opinion of the Australian troops and no real appreciation of the conditions under which the fighting in New Guinea was being conducted. On 6 September, MacArthur wrote to General George Marshall that, \\"the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking.\\" Jones observes, \\"The attitude that the Australians were poor fighters pervaded thinking at MacArthur's headquarters\\". General Sir Thomas Blamey chatting with troops during MacArthur's visit (AWM150815) The Australian government was also concerned. On 9 September, Army Minister Frank Forde directed Blamey to visit Port Moresby, which he did, from 12 to 14 September. On his return, he was able to assure the government of his confidence in Rowell and that the situation was in hand. Nonetheless, MacArthur persuaded the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to send Blamey to New Guinea to take command there and \\"energise the situation\\". By this manoeuvre, MacArthur ensured that Blamey would be the scapegoat if Port Moresby fell. MacArthur visited Port Moresby briefly from 2 October. On 3 October, he went as far forward as Owers' Corner, where he spent about an hour. He was present as the 16th Brigade, under Brigadier John Lloyd, was commencing its advance along the track. He subsequently established his advance headquarters in Port Moresby on 6 November 1942 (just after Kokoda was reoccupied) until January 1943. Command crisis The \\"command crisis\\" is referred to by McCarthy (among others) in the Australian official history as part of a chapter title: \\"Ioriabiawa: and a command in crisis\\". Academic and historian, David Horner's first book is titled, Crisis of Command: Australian Generalship and the Japanese Threat, 1941‚Äì1943, in which he studies the generalship in these early stages of the war with Japan. Anderson notes that, while the \\"command crisis\\" specifically relates to Blamey's sacking of Rowell, the phrase can also be applied to the sackings of Allen and Potts. =Rowell= Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell (AWM26583) Complying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 with only a small personal staff. It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters. McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns. Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters as much as the expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff. Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring. Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece. Perhaps, more importantly, there was a sense of disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. In at letter to Major General Cyril Clowes at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, \\"Either I am fit to command the show or I am not.\\" While the situation continued to simmer, it came to a head after Blamey had visited Milne Bay on 25 September at MacArthur's suggestion and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to Wanigela. Major General George Kenney noted that Rowell was \\"not even consulted anymore\\". Rowell confronted Blamey on the issue and was relieved of command on 28 September. In a communication to Curtin, Blamey referred to Rowell as insubordinate and obstructive. Rowell was replaced by Lieutenant General Edmund Herring. =Allen= On 9 September 1942, Allen's command responsibilities were narrowed to the direct prosecution of the Kokoda Track campaign and flank protection. Important to subsequent events, NGF retained control of aerial resupply. The Australian advance commenced with the attack of 28 September against the (abandoned) Japanese positions on Ioribaiwa Ridge. The 16th Brigade commenced to advance forward on 3 October. Major General Arthur Allen (left) and Brigadier Ken Eather (centre), September 1942 (AWM026750) Allen had advanced his headquarters to Menari by 11 October. The 25th Brigade was advancing on two tracks from Efogi, toward Templeton's Crossing. He was mindful of the need to keep his troops fresh enough to fight and of the supply problems imposed by operations over the track. There were already difficulties in air drops meeting the division's needs. These concerns were expressed to Herring on 7 October, including the need to create a reserve over and above the daily needs. As a consequence, the supply programme intensified. On 5 October, Blamey wrote to MacArthur in \\"hard terms\\" of the logistical difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen. Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen to increase his rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola‚Äîeffectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his point of supply. Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an \\"extremely risky\\" strategy. Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. The position of Blamey was premised on the proposition that the Japanese were an enemy in retreat. In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised. On 17 October, Allen, now at Myola, received the following message from Blamey: Allen's response was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report could be made by a liaison officer or more senior officer. MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: \\"Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty.\\" Allen replied, in part: \\"I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel that they could not have done better.\\" Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having \\"botched\\" the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays. On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey. Allen had vouched for the judgement and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification. =Potts= Brigadier Arnold Potts (left), forward area, September 1942 (AWM026716) Potts had been sent forward to Isurava with orders to attack and recapture Kokoda. Instead, his force was unable to withstand the Japanese attacks and he was forced to conduct a fighting withdrawal, suffering a disastrous defeat at Brigade Hill. Increasingly concerned, MacArthur applied pressure to the chain-of-command. Potts was recalled to Port Moresby by Rowell on 10 September, with Porter as his replacement. Horner reports Rowell's motive as dissatisfaction with Potts' \\"mishandling\\" of his brigade and a need to obtain a first-hand account of conditions. Anderson reports Allen agreed with the decision, judging that Potts was \\"either tired or losing a grip of the situation\\". On arriving at Port Moresby, Potts was interviewed by Rowell and Allen, whereupon, satisfied with his performance, he was returned to command his brigade. However, in a private interview (overheard by Potts' staff captain, Ken Murdoch) on 22 October, the day of the \\"running rabbit\\" address, Blamey told Potts he was no longer required in New Guinea: \\"Failures like the Kokoda Trail ... could not be tolerated‚Äîthe men had shown that something was lacking ..[and he] blamed the leaders.\\" Potts was transferred to command the 23rd Brigade reforming in Darwin, exchanging postings with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty. Herring has claimed that the decision was his‚Äîfeeling that Potts needed to be rested and wanting Dougherty to take the position. Murdoch was inundated with resignation papers from officers affronted by Potts' treatment. Potts instructed Murdoch to reject all resignations. The \\"running rabbits\\" incident On 22 October, after the relief of the 21st Brigade by the 25th Brigade, Blamey visited Koitaki, near Port Moresby, where the 21st Brigade was encamped. Shortly after relieving Potts, Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on a parade ground. The men of the Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. Instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been \\"beaten\\" by inferior forces, and that \\"no soldier should be afraid to die\\". \\"Remember,\\" Blamey was reported as saying, \\"it's the rabbit who runs who gets shot, not the man holding the gun.\\" There was a wave of murmurs and restlessness among the soldiers. Officers and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) managed to quiet the soldiers and many later said that Blamey was lucky to escape with his life. During the march-past, many disobeyed the \\"eyes right\\" order. In a later letter to his wife, an enraged Brigadier Potts swore to \\"fry his [Blamey's] soul in the afterlife\\" over this incident. According to witnesses, when Blamey subsequently visited Australian wounded in the camp hospital, inmates nibbled lettuce, while wrinkling their noses and whispering \\"run, rabbit, run\\" (the chorus of a popular song during the war). =Analysis= Lieutenant General Edmund Herring (AWM151139) Historian Peter Dean acknowledges the general interpretation that the actions of MacArthur and Blamey were \\"to salvage their own positions at the expense of the troops\\" but reports that MacArthur, himself, was under pressure, citing a cable from the US Joint Chiefs to MacArthur of 16 October, \\"reminding him that they viewed the situation in Papua as 'critical. Dean also notes that this coincided with the relief of Vice Admiral Robert Ghormley, Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the south Pacific who had operational control of the forces engaged at Guadalcanal. The pressure brought to bear by MacArthur was in the face of \\"complicated operational and strategic contexts\\", stating that, \\"an understanding of these contexts has been poorly done in most accounts of the fighting [in Papua].\\" This is encapsulated in correspondence from Brigadier General Stephen J. Chamberlin (MacArthur's operations chief) to MacArthur's Chief-of-Staff, Richard K. Sutherland, of 30 October 1942: \\"the key to our plan of action lies in the success or failure of the South Pacific in holding Guadalcanal ...\\" (that is, that the position at Guadalcanal was tenuous). However, with specific reference to Allen, Horner finds, \\"MacArthur showed an abysmal lack of trust in his subordinate [Blamey and his view that Allen was doing all he could], and an unwarranted interference in the tactical handling of troops some 1,500 miles from his headquarters.\\" While the Curtin government was largely steadfast in recalling the 2nd AIF from the Middle East to Australia against considerable opposition from Churchill, Horner observes the government's complete dependence on MacArthur, which compromised Blamey's relationship with it. His analysis also observes that these events were underpinned by the logistical problems faced by the NGF on the track and elsewhere. Horner's criticism of Blamey in sacking Allen is that he was in no position to accurately assess Allen's performance, observing that if Vasey could be flown into Myola to relieve Allen, then an assessment could have been arranged using the same means. Blamey acted to placate MacArthur because he (Blamey) was unwilling to risk his own job. Blamey had demonstrated \\"a remarkable lack of loyalty\\" toward his subordinate. To some degree, Herring shares in this criticism. Williams, however, observes that Allen's advance was nonetheless slower than might reasonably have been expected and that the criticisms leveled at him and leading to his sacking were reasonably justified. Horner observes of Rowell, that his only failure was an inability to work with Blamey and that Blamey was more culpable in that, he was unwilling to risk his own position. He should have shown more trust and loyalty toward his subordinate; negated MacArthur's manoeuvring and avoided the situation. Regardless of the justifications made, the sackings created a climate of suspicion, animosity, personal rivalries and a \\"toxic atmosphere\\" which pervaded the senior ranks and was detrimental to the war effort. Horner observes that Blamey trod a precarious line between \\"maintaining his own position and protecting the Australian commanders, between risking his own replacement and risking the distrust of his subordinates\\". Horner notes, \\"the arguments between generals and politicians might seem of little consequence. But the opposite is the case. It was errors by men like MacArthur and Blamey which lead to the near disaster in New Guinea. As usual, it was the men in the front line who paid the heaviest price.\\"Quoted in First phase ‚Äì Japanese advance =Japanese landings and initial advance= The Japanese brought rubber boats to cross the Kumusi River as they advanced. This one was left as they retreated. (AWM013707) The Japanese landings at Gona commenced at about 5:30 pm on 21 July 1942. They were opposed by Allied air attacks until darkness fell and again in the morning, for the loss of one transport ship. The Japanese landings were observed by patrols of the PIB and officers of the ANGAU. Templeton brought forward two of his platoons. His remaining platoon was to protect Kokoda. First contact was made at about 4.00 pm on 23 July. A PIB patrol led by Lieutenant Chalk ambushed advancing Japanese near Awala. The bridge across the Kumusi River at Wairopi was destroyed by the withdrawing Australians and the Japanese were harassed as they made a crossing. Owen had flown to Kokoda on 24 July and went forward with Templeton to assess the situation. Owen then returned to Kokoda and called for reinforcements to be landed. An ambush position was sited about east of Gorari and sprung at about midday on 25 July. The force of two platoons and the remaining PIB then withdrew to Oivi, taking up a position that evening. D Company's 16 Platoon arrived by air at Kokoda in two flights on 26 July. The first flight arrived at 10:00 am. They were immediately sent forward and had joined the force at Oivi before the Japanese attack at 3:00 pm. The force was able to hold the Japanese for a time, before being forced to retire on a secondary position. With the Japanese trying to encircle this position, Templeton was concerned for the second flight yet to arrive and set out to warn it. There was a burst of fire shortly after he left. Templeton was never seen again. Watson took command. As the force was increasingly threatened by encirclement, it broke toward Deniki. At Kokoda, Owen had lost contact with his forward platoons and also withdrew to Deniki, departing at 11:00 am on 27 July. On the following morning, a small party of stragglers arrived. Having spent the previous night at Kokoda, they reported the village unoccupied. Leaving two sections at Deniki, Owen quickly advanced back to the village. =Battle of Kokoda= By 11:30 am, Owen had reoccupied Kokoda with a force consisting of B Company, the remaining PIB and members of the ANGAU that had joined Maroubra Force, variously numbered at between 80 and 148. Owen called for reinforcements and shortly after, two planes appeared overhead but did not land as the defenders were slow in removing the barricades that had been placed across the airstrip and the pilots believed the situation too risky to land. There are inconsistencies in the various accounts of this event‚Äîmost significantly, whether this occurred on 28 July or the day earlier, when Owen was about to abandon Kokoda. Kokoda village and airfield, August 1942. (AWM128400) The Kokoda plateau is tongue shaped, with steep-sloped sides. The government station is located at its northern tip. The track from Oivi approaches the tip from the east. The track to Deniki runs down its centre to the south. Owen positioned his force around the station at its tip. At 1:30 pm, advance elements of the Japanese force that was to total approximately 200 were sighted. As the Japanese commander, Captain Ogawa, assembled his force, the Australian defenders were harassed through the night, including fire from light mortars and a Type 92 battalion gun, which was particularly telling as the Australians had no means to respond to it. The main attack commenced at 2:30 in the early morning of 29 July. Owen was in the forward positions to inspire his troops and received a mortal gunshot wound above his right eye. Watson assumed command and, as the force was being overrun, withdrew to Deniki. Following the first battle at Kokoda, there was a brief pause in fighting during which both the Japanese and the Australians concentrated their forces for the next phase. For the Japanese, this was the 1st Battalion of the 144th Infantry Regiment, of which the 1st Company had faced B Company at Kokoda. The battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tsukamoto Hatsuo. C Company and A Company of the 39th Battalion arrived at Deniki on 30 and 31 July respectively. Major Allan Cameron, Brigade Major of the 30th Brigade, had been sent forward to take command of Maroubra Force, arriving on 4 August. Cameron formed a low opinion of B Company after encountering troops moving southward along the track as he moved forward. Cameron's arrival coincided with a telephone line being established from the head of the track to Deniki. This greatly improved communications with Port Moresby. D Company arrived on 6 August. With this force, Cameron resolved to counterattack and recapture Kokoda. His plan was to advance along three routes assigned to each of his fresh companies with B Company securing Deniki. C Company was to advance along the main track to Kokoda. A Company, under Captain Noel Symington, was to advance along a parallel track to the east that was unknown to the Japanese. D Company was to advance on a track from Deniki to Pirivi. Pirivi was just south of the Oivi‚ÄìKokoda track and about east of Kokoda. There, it was to take up a blocking position. Final orders were issued by Cameron on the afternoon of 7 August, for an advance the following morning to the form-up points and an attack at noon. Cameron's force totaled 550 with the three attacking companies numbering 430. This was opposed by 522 men of 1/144 Battalion and a total force of 660, including an artillery platoon and combat engineers. Tsukamoto also chose to attack toward Deniki the same day along the main track and C Company encountered resistance, having advanced only . Corporal (later Sergeant) Sanopa, of the Royal Papua Constabulary, attached to the PIB, featured prominently in the fighting around Kokoda.(By William Dargie AWM ART23175) The attack on Kokoda was preceded with bombing and strafing by sixteen P‚Äì39s. Symington was able to advance into Kokoda and, meeting minimal resistance, was able to occupy it. A message was sent with Corporal Sanopa to Cameron requiring resupply by air and reinforcements to hold the village. C Company advancing on the main track, met increasing resistance as it came upon Tsukamoto's main force. Unable to advance further, it withdrew to Deniki, with the Japanese closely following. It arrived there at 5:50 pm. As D Company, under Captain Max Bidstrup took up a position at the junction on the Oivi‚ÄìKokoda track, it came under strong attack by engineers from both directions. Judging the attack on Kokoda had been unsuccessful he withdrew at 4:30 pm back to Deniki with his main force, arriving at about 1:30 pm on 9 August (with 17 Platoon, that had become isolated in the fighting, arriving the next day). Sanopa arrived with Symington's message in the morning of 9 August. Cameron requested both an air drop of supplies and aerial reconnaissance to ascertain the situation at Kokoda. He was informed that resupply could not occur until the following day. Tsukamoto had sent a company back to Kokoda, arriving at 11:30 am on 9 August. Without resupply and facing determined attacks Symington's force held until 7:00 pm on 10 August. It then withdrew westwards by a circuitous route back to Isurava, arriving on 13 August. The reconnaissance flight occurred in the morning of 10 August but the promised resupply was delayed by weather until 12 August when it was dropped into the hands of the Japanese. The Machine Gun Company of the 39th Battalion had deployed along the track (less its medium machine guns) and had been holding a position at Isurava for about a week. Cameron called it forward, arriving in Deniki at 5:00 pm on 12 August, it exchanged roles with B Company. Patrols from Deniki had reported the Japanese advancing en masse from Kokoda. Their attack commenced 5:30 am on 13 August and continued throughout the day. Sporadic gunfire continued through most of the night and the attack was renewed the next morning. As the Japanese threatened his flanks and rear, Cameron ordered the withdrawal to Isurava at 9:50 am. =Battle of Isurava= Tsukamoto did not continue to press the advance but waited for Horii to concentrate his main force, estimating that the Australian force holding Kokoda had numbered around 1,000, to 1,200. The force available to Horii was based on five infantry battalions with supporting arms and services variously reported at 3,000 and 5,000 strong. Horii planned to attack with four infantry battalions, holding one of these in immediate reserve to exploit the result. The force that engaged the Australians at Isurava totaled 2,130, including artillery. On 16 August, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived at Isurava to take command of the 39th Battalion. He also assumed command of Maroubra Force which, by then, included the first company of the 53rd Battalion to arrive at Alola, approximately south of Isurava. Command passed to Porter when he arrived with headquarters of the 30th Brigade on 19 August. Potts, with two battalions of the 21st Brigade was also moving forward but their advance was delayed at a \\"critical time\\" due to insufficient supplies at Myola. Potts assumed command of the combined force on 23 August, with orders to attack toward Kokoda and the intention of relieving the 39th Battalion in order to alleviate his supply difficulties. The Australian force he commanded amounted to 2,290. Papuan carriers evacuate Australian casualties on 30 August 1942 The position at Isurava occupied by the 39th Battalion was bounded front and rear by small creeks that ran into the gorge-like Eora Creek to the west; with a steep spur-line rising to the west. Main ridges, bounding Eora Creek ran north‚Äìsouth. The Isurava position and main track were on the \\"Isurava ridge\\" or western side of Eora Creek. A parallel track ran along the side of the \\"Abuari ridge\\" or western side of Eora Creek. Honner later recounted that it was: \\"as good a delaying position as could be found on the main track.\\"R. Honner, \\"The 39th at Isurava\\" in Stand-To, July‚ÄìAugust 1956; quoted in The position was, however, overlooked by a spur-line to the north (referred to in the sources as a ridge), which afforded the Japanese a position from which they could fire down on the Australian position. The main force of the 53rd Battalion was located at Alola but tasked with security of the Abuari track on the western flank. Forward positions and patrols on both tracks had been contacted on 26 August. The 39th Battalion positions came under artillery fire as the 2/14th Battalion was moving to occupy them. The 39th Battalion then took-up a position to their immediate rear. The 53rd Battalion was responsible for protecting the eastern flank and approach along the Abuari ridge. Through the 26 and 27 August, the position there became increasingly uncertain. Forward companies of the 53rd Battalion failed to act decisively, the command party of the battalion, moving forward to take direct command was ambushed, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward dead. The 2/16th Battalion was called up from near Myola to shore up the position on the eastern flank. From the 27 August, the Japanese attacks increased in intensity along both approaches. On the Abuari track, reinforcement by two companies of the 2/16th Battalion was able to stay the advance of the 2/144th Battalion on this axis. Japanese sources later noted that the defence by the 53rd and 2/16th on the right offered them \\"little opportunity to make a speedy exploitation\\",Committee of the 144th Infantry Regiment History (1974) p. 18 quoted in although, the Japanese commander has been criticised for not pressing his advantage there, apparently under the belief that it was more strongly held. On the approach to Isurava, the 2/14th and 39th Battalions came under increasing pressure from Japanese attacks, culminating in hand-to-hand fighting in which Private Bruce Kingsbury was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Eyewitnesses said that Kingsbury's actions had a profound effect on the Japanese, temporarily halting their momentum. His citation read, in part: > Private Kingsbury, who was one of the few survivors of a platoon which had > been overrun ... immediately volunteered to join a different platoon which > had been ordered to counterattack. He rushed forward, firing the Bren gun > from his hip through terrific machine-gun fire, and succeeded in clearing a > path through the enemy. Continuing to sweep enemy positions with his fire, > and inflicting an extremely high number of casualties upon them, Private > Kingsbury was then seen to fall to the ground, shot dead by the bullet from > a sniper hiding in the wood. Private Bruce Steel Kingsbury VC. (AWM P01637.001) Through this time, the Japanese were able to bring telling fire upon the Isurava position. Most accounts report this came from machine guns, [medium or heavy] mortars and artillery pieces. The account in Williams suggests that the mortars have been misidentified‚Äîattributing this instead to artillery alone. Williams reports eight artillery guns: with six artillery guns and machine gun fire falling on the rest house (later). The other two were dispersed in support of the 2/144th east of the gorge and the 1/144th in close support. The Australians were only able to reply with a single 3-inch medium mortar of the 39th Battalion that arrived on 27 August, having been brought up by the 2/14th after being airdropped at Myola. With the western flank threatened, the Australian force at Isurava withdrew to a position at the Isurava resthouse (between Isurava and Alola) during the late hours of 29 August. On 30 August, the 3/144th attacked from the western flank and cut the route rearward to Alola. The attack was preceded by intense fire from the Japanese mountain artillery. At 3:00 pm, Potts order a withdrawal to Eora Village. Many members of Maroubra Force became separated including Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key, who was subsequently captured and killed. In his post-operation report, Potts noted: \\"At no time were 2/14th and 2/16th Australian infantry battalions ever intact and available for a concerted operation, wholly and solely due to the delays occasioned by supply.\\" =Eora Creek ‚Äì Templeton's Crossing= Members of the 39th Battalion withdrawing after the battle of Isurava Disengaging from the battle at Isurava, Potts was compelled by the pursuing Japanese to conduct a fighting withdrawal. As the situation at Milne Bay stabilised, Allen released the 2/27th Battalion to join the rest of the 21st Brigade. Departing along the track on 30 August, it would take several days to reach the front and have no impact on this stage of the campaign. During the battle Horii decided to commit the 2/41st, under Major Mitsuo Koiwai, with the aim of conducting a wide arc to the west and emerging on the track to the south of Alola. They became lost, and in fact did not regain contact with the main Japanese force until after the battle, without firing a single shot. Horii now assigned the battalion to the vanguard to pursue the withdrawing Maroubra Force. In the initial withdrawal, the 2/16th Battalion had a screening role, withdrawing by stages from the rear of Alola toward Eora Village, while the village itself was held by what remained of the 39th Battalion. As most of Maroubra Force had withdrawn through their positions, the 2/16th Battalion then retired on Eora Village, arriving about midday 1 September. It then took up a defensive position on a bald spur on the southern side of the creek that overlooked the crossing and village. The 2/14th Battalion was about south along the track. The 39th Battalion, by then numbering less than 150, was ordered to proceed to Kagi and hold there. It remained forward until it was withdrawn on 5 September. On the morning of 31 August, the 53rd Battalion was sent out of battle and ordered to return to Myola, where part of the battalion remained, providing work parties. Commencing with Eora Village, the 2/16th Battalion occupied delaying positions along the track: withdrawing from Eora Village at 6:00 am on 2 September; to a position forward of Templeton's Crossing until dusk of 2 September; and, a position overlooking Dump 1 (on Eora Creek about south of Templeton's crossing), until the night of 4 September. At each stage, the 2/14th Battalion screened the withdrawal of the 2/16th Battalion. Potts was, with this final engagement, able to make a clean break from the Japanese advance but only with the loss of Myola‚Äîthe terrain afforded the Japanese too great an advantage and it could be bypassed, using the original track to the west. Potts abandoned Myola, destroying what supplies could not be carried out. It has been credited as a successful rearguard action for the Australians. =Battle of Brigade Hill= Men of the 2/27th Battalion returned to the Australian lines at Itiki after being isolated during the Battle of Brigade Hill‚ÄìMission Ridge. (AWM027017) Under mounting pressure from Allen and Rowell to make a stand, Potts determined to do so at Mission Ridge, which ran northward from Brigade Hill toward the village of Efogi. Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Cooper, commanding the 2/27th Battalion had reached as far as Kagi with the leading companies on 4 September. Cooper then concentrated his battalion in position just south of Efogi, where he could screen the brigade before he was recalled back to the position of the main force during the afternoon of 6 September. The 2/27th occupied a forward position astride the track. The 2/14th Battalion was to its immediate rear and slightly to the east. Brigade headquarters was approximately to the rear. The main force of the 2/16 Battalion was between brigade headquarters and the forward battalions, while its D Company was located with brigade headquarters as rear protection. Horii had become dissatisfied with the rate of advance made with the 41st Regiment in the vanguard and replaced it with 144th Regiment from 5 September. Colonel Kusonose Masao employed his 2nd and 3rd Battalions in the attack. As the Japanese moved into position through the night of 6 September, Australians observed lights which Anderson describes as a \\"lantern parade\\". An airstrike was called for the following morning with eight B‚Äì26 Marauders and four P‚Äì40s as escorts, bombing and strafing. Anderson reports that it had a greater effect on the morale; positive and negative of the Australians and Japanese respectively, than it did in causing casualties. During 7 September, the 3/144th Battalion probed toward the position of the 2/27th Battalion, with Japanese artillery and machine guns firing upon the forward Australian battalions. The 21st Brigade was only able to direct fire from a section of three mortars under command of the brigade. At 5:00 pm, the brigade war diary reports the 2/27th Battalion being \\"hammered by mortars, QF gun and HMG\\". During the night, the 2/144th Battalion conducted an undetected enveloping move to the west and attacked up the ridge just before dawn to join the track between brigade headquarters and the forward battalions. At much the same time, the 3/144th Battalion launched an intense attack against the 2/27th Battalion. In the fighting that developed, the 2/27th Battalion drew back on the 2/14th Battalion's position while the 2/16th and 2/14th Battalions counterattacked south. Brigade headquarters (and D Company of the 2/16th Battalion) also attacked north to try to dislodge the incursion of the Japanese 2/144th Battalion without success. Immediately before communication forward broke down, Potts passed command of the brigade group to Caro. As the situation deteriorated, the headquarters group withdrew to Nauro. The 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions broke track to the east and were able to rejoin the brigade. The 2/27th Battalion, however, were unable to follow and were considered effectively lost until they emerged from the jungle three weeks later. The battle at Brigade Hill ‚Äì Mission Ridge has been described as a \\"stunning victory\\" for the Japanese and a \\"catastrophe\\" for the Australians. =Ioribaiwa and Imita Ridge= An Australian soldier inspects Japanese artillery rounds abandoned at Ioribaiwa. These rounds had been carried the length of the track by Japanese soldiers. Even before the battle at Mission Ridge had concluded, Rowell had issued orders recalling Potts to Port Moresby. What remained of the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions rejoined the 21st Brigade and withdrew southwards towards Ioribaiwa and harassed the Japanese advance. Porter, having orders to stabilise the position, took command of Maroubra Force on 10 September. By this time, the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalion were so reduced in strength that they were formed into a combined force fielding a company strength from each. It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion and by the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion, although the latter did not move forward. The 25th Brigade under Eather was being sent forward to relieve the situation. As he prepared to attack, Eather assumed command of Maroubra Force. Porter had positioned the composite battalion astride the track on the Ioribaiwa ridgeline, running from the main range to the northwest. The track followed a spur-line falling north toward Ofi Creek. The 3rd Battalion was positioned on the ridge to its immediate right on the eastern side of the track. It was the major ridgeline before Imita Ridge and the head of the track. Eather planned to attack, advancing past Porters' flanks with two of his battalions‚Äîthe 2/31st Battalion on the western flank and the 2/33rd Battalion on the eastern flank. The 2/25th Battalion was his reserve. It took up a position on the track behind Porter's force. On the night 13‚Äì14 September, the 25th Brigade bivouacked to the rear of Porter's force ready to advance. As Eather's battalions were deploying, the Japanese attacked. Eather immediately called off the attack and adopted a defensive posture. This had the effect of placing his advancing battalions on either flank and significantly increasing his frontage. From Brigade Hill, Kusonose had continued to pursue the Australians with the 2nd/144th and 3rd/144th Battalions. Horii had halted his main force awaiting permission to continue the advance. Kusonose's initial attack was made with half of the 3rd/144th Battalion advancing along the axis of the track, while the 2nd/144th Battalion was to make a flanking attack from the west. Kusonose was able to bring fire on the Australian positions from eight guns. Fighting continued through the day but both attacks had been held. An attack on 15 September was made by his reserve, the second half of the 3rd/144th Battalion against what he thought was the eastern flank of the Australian force. Unaware that Maroubra Force had been reinforced, this lodged in a gap between the Australian 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion. Counter attacks by two companies of the 2/25th and two companies of the 2/33rd Battalion that day were unable to dislodge the Japanese from this foothold. Fighting on 16 September continued much as it had on the previous day, although the Japanese lodged between the 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion took to the high-ground‚ÄîSankaku Yama (Triangle Mountain). From there, they compromised Eather's communication with the 2/33rd Battalion. Feeling his position was vulnerable, he requested and received permission from Allen to withdraw back to Imita Ridge, with Allen stressing that there could be no further withdrawal. Eather commenced the withdrawal from 11:00 am, which Anderson describes as, \\"well-organised and orderly\\". Eather has been criticised, particularly by the author, Williams, for disengaging from battle too soon and ceding victory to Kusonose when the latter was at an impasse and frustrated. Having committed his reserve, Kusonose was still unable to break the Australian defence. Interlude ‚Äì Imita Ridge A 25-pounder gun of the 14th Field Regiment being pulled into position near Uberi. (AWM026855) On 17 September, Eather was able to consolidate his position on Imita Ridge. The 2/33rd Battalion had been tasked to delay any further Japanese advance. A number of ambushes were set with mixed results. The Australian position, near the head of the track substantially resolved the difficulty of supply and the force was soon to be bolstered by the arrival of the 16th Brigade. Two 25-pounder guns of the 14th Field Regiment would at last be able to provide artillery support to Maroubra Force. As the Japanese had advanced from Brigade Hill, a programme of patrolling was instigated to secure the flank approaches to Port Moresby. This utilised the 2/6th Independent Company extensively to patrol from Laloki along the Goldie River toward Ioribaiwa and for other tasks. Jawforce was raised from rear details of the 21st Brigade to patrol the eastern flank and approach from Nauro to Jawarere. Honner Force was raised with orders to attack Japanese supply lines between Nauro and Menari. Though the conceived plan came to nought through supply difficulties, it patrolled the western flank to the limit of its supply without encounter. Upon reaching Ioribaiwa, the lead Japanese elements began to celebrate‚Äîfrom their vantage point on the hills around Ioribaiwa, the Japanese soldiers could see the lights of Port Moresby and the Coral Sea beyond. They made no concerted attempt to advance on Eather's position at Imita Ridge. In this interlude, Eather patrolled toward Ioribaiwa, both to harass the Japanese and to gather intelligence on their disposition. By 27 September, he issued orders to his battalion commanders for an \\"all-out\\" assault the following day. The attack found that Ioribaiwa had been abandoned and the artillery fired by the Australians had been without effect. Patrols followed up immediately, with one of the 2/25th Battalion finding that by 30 September, Nauro was unoccupied. Ordered to withdraw, the position at Ioribaiwa had been abandoned by the last Japanese troops during the night of 26 September. Second phase ‚Äì Australian counter-offensive The Japanese withdrawal along the Kokoda Track The 25th Brigade, to which the 3rd Battalion was attached, commenced its advance against the Japanese and the 16th Brigade followed to occupy the positions on Imita Ridge. Allen was conscious of the supply difficulties he would encounter and moderated his advance accordingly but was pressured by Blamey and MacArthur to pursue what they perceived to be a fleeing enemy. In fact though, Horii's force had made a clean break and withdrawn back to a series of four defensive positions prepared in advance. These were the responsibility of the Stanley Detachment, which was based on the 2/144th Battalion. The first two positions were forward near the northern ends of the two tracks north from Kagi‚Äîthe main Myola track and the original track, also known as the Mount Bellamy Track. The third position overlooked Templeton's Crossing, where the two tracks rejoined. The fourth position was at Eora Village. =Second Battle of Eora Creek ‚Äì Templeton's Crossing= On 10 October, Myola was reoccupied by the Australians. By 12 October, the 2/33rd Battalion was advancing toward Templeton's Crossing on the Myola Track and the 2/25th Battalion on the Mount Bellamy Track. The 16th Brigade was advancing on Menari to take up a position at Myola with the intention of taking the vanguard as the brigade moved through Templeton's Crossing. Australian advance to contact Members of the 16th Brigade moving forward along the track. (AWM027054) On the Myola track, the Stanley Detachment had deployed its main force in-line along the track in considerable depth and in well developed positions. A forward patrol of the 2/33rd Battalion contacted the most lightly held forward position on 10 October. The positions resisted a series of frontal and flanking manoeuvres. Through 14 October, the 3rd Battalion moved around the western flank to co- ordinate with the 2/33rd Battalion in an attack on 15 October. However, the attack found that the Japanese had already withdrawn. On the Mount Bellamy Track, the 2/25th Battalion met with the lesser Japanese force on 13 October and, after reporting the Japanese positions clear on 15 October, patrolled to Templeton's Crossing the following day. These two engagements have subsequently been identified as the opening phase of the Second Battle of Templeton's Crossing ‚Äì Eora Creek. Templeton's Crossing The battalions of the 25th Brigade (less the 2/31st Battalion further back) reached the northern confluence of the tracks at Templeton's Crossing on 16 October. As the 3rd Battalion advanced, the Japanese position was identified in the late afternoon. It straddled the track on the high ground to the east of Eora Creek and north of the crossing. The Stanley detachment had occupied two parallel spurs running toward the creek from the main ridgeline. Cameron, now commanding the 3rd Battalion, concentrated his force for an attack on the morrow. Attacks on 17 and 18 October were directed from the high ground on the Japanese eastern flank by the 3rd Battalion and A and D Companies of the 2/25th Battalion but failed to achieve a decisive outcome. During the morning of 19 October, the 2/2nd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Cedric Edgar pushed forward to assist the 3rd Battalion, while the remaining two battalions of the 16th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier John Lloyd relieved the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions. On 20 October, the 2/2nd Battalion mounted an attack employing four companies from the high-ground to the east. This attack was to be renewed the following day, 21 October, but the Stanley Detachment had withdrawn in the night. Horii's main force had been withdrawn to Kokoda‚ÄìOivi. When the Stanley Detachment was forced to withdraw from Templeton's Crossing, he sent all available reinforcement to man the final position at Eora Village. Eora Village A log bridge on the track ‚Äì first crossing of Eora Creek north of Myola. (AWM P02424.100) The Australian advance then began toward Eora Village. As a patrol entered Eora Village at about 10:30 am, it was fired upon. From the village, the track crossed log bridges over Eora Creek and a tributary before following along the western side of Eora Creek as it headed northward. Overlooking the village from the north was a spur-line rising to the west. It was here that the Japanese had prepared two defensive positions ‚Äì one on the lower slopes of the spur and another much higher up. Anderson reports that the Japanese had spent nearly two months in fortifying the position. From these, they could bring fire from medium machine guns and five artillery pieces. On the afternoon of 22 October, against representations from his battalion commanders, Lloyd ordered a frontal attack on the Japanese [lower] position. This commenced shortly after. Anderson describes what followed as being highly confused but, dawn of 24 October found the attacking force of battalion strength largely pinned down in front of the Japanese position, having suffered 34 killed and many more injured, with no prospect of success. Lloyd then ordered the 2/3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel John Stevenson to attack down on the Japanese positions from the top of Eora Ridge (to the west) but this took two days to deploy to the forming-up point. The attack of the 2/3rd Battalion commenced in the morning of 27 October. Horii had ordered a withdrawal from the position on the night of 28 October. The 2/3rd Battalion resumed its attack on 28 October, co-ordinated with the remainder of the brigade. The position was now only lightly held by the 3rd/144th about to withdraw, and the situation turned into a rout. =Occupation of Kokoda= Flag-raising ceremony after the capture of Kokoda. (AWM013572) On 28 October, Vasey arrived at Myola to relieve Allen. The Australian advance recommenced on 29 October. With a loss of positions that commanded the Gap and the approach to Port Moresby, Horii turned his attention to defending the beachheads at Buna‚ÄìGona. He concentrated his force around Oivi and Gorari. While a rearguard force screened his preparations, this was successively withdrawn without contact being made. Aola was entered on 30 October and airdrops the following day alleviated supply problems as the Australian line-of-communication extended from Myola. On 2 November, a patrol of the 2/31st Battalion entered Kokoda and found that it had been abandoned. At 3:30 pm the following day, Vasey led a flag-raising ceremony with hundreds present. The 7th Division could now land supplies at Kokoda. On 6 November, Vasey held a further ceremony in which he awarded medals and made gifts of trade-goods to the Papuans that had supported the Australians. =Battle of Oivi‚ÄìGorari= From Kokoda, the route to Wairopi, and then, to Buna‚ÄìGona, was mainly easterly, whereas the advance from Eora Village was mainly to the north. On the main track from Kokoda to Waropi (at the crossing of the Kumusi River) Horii had constructed strong defensive positions, prepared several weeks before. These were centred on the heights overlooking Oivi, with a position in depth at Gorari, which also covered an approach from the southern parallel track. The 41st Regiment, with a battalion of the 144th Regiment and seven artillery pieces faced an advance from the west. Two battalions of the 144th Regiment held the position at Gorari and a track approaching from the south. The force headquarters was to the immediate rear. A 70 mm infantry gun captured during the fight at Oivi‚ÄìGorari. (AWM013644) The 16th Brigade (including the 3rd Battalion) patrolled toward Oivi, making contact on 4 November. In fighting that continued until 6 November, it tried unsuccessfully to break the position. Vasey then committed the 25th Brigade, with the 2/1st Battalion attached, to an attack from the south toward Gorari. The brigade was to advance along the southern parallel track as far as Waju. The 2/1st Battalion leading, initially overshot this and had to retrace its steps but was ready to advance north on 7 November. Horii had become aware of the Australian movement and dispatched his two battalions at Gorari south along the connecting track. They established an all-round defence on a position near Baribe, about halfway between the two parallel tracks. Horii also called the 1st/144th back from Oivi to occupy the position left vacant at Goari. On 8 November, Eather contacted the position at Baribe, enveloping it with the 2/25th and 2/31st Battalions. On 9 November, the 2/33rd and 2/1st Battalions pushed around the Japanese position on the connecting track and advanced on Gorari, where they attacked the 1/144th Battalion and Horii's headquarters. Bombing and strafing attacks were also conducted against the Japanese positions near Oivi. By 10 November, Horii ordered a withdrawal but the situation for the Japanese had degenerated into a rout. Fighting had largely ceased by midday 11 November. The Japanese lost around 430 killed, around 400 wounded and abandoned fifteen artillery pieces among other material. Advance on Buna‚ÄìGona Closing in on the Japanese beachhead, 16‚Äì21 November 1942 Most of the Japanese force withdrew to the Kumusi River and 1,200 are estimated to have made the crossing of the flooded river. Horii was swept downstream and later drowned. Others followed the river downstream to the coast. Milner reports the strength gathered there as 900, under command of Colonel Yazawa. The 25th Brigade contacted the Japanese rearguard near Wairopi on 12 November but these withdrew in the night. While most of Vasey's force was rested, patrols continued to search out Japanese survivors and engineers were dealing with the problem of establishing a bridgehead. The crossing of the two brigades was completed on the morning of 16 November and they began their advance on the Japanese beachheads. The 25th Brigade took the track toward Gona while the 16th Brigade advanced along the track toward Sanananda. Elements of the US 32nd Division were advancing on Buna by a coastal route from the southeast. =Flanking move by US 32nd Division= The US 32nd Division had arrived in Australia in May. With few US forces to choose from, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the divisional headquarters and two regimental combat teams from the 126th and 128th infantry regiments to deploy to Port Moresby. They arrived between 15 and 28 September 1942. On 11 September, MacArthur added a plan for the 126th Infantry Regiment to conduct a wide flanking move to the east with the goal to engage the Japanese rear near Wairopi. The 2nd Battalion 126th Regiment, with supporting elements attached, was tasked with traversing the track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure. From Jaure, at the headwaters of the Kumusi River, the force was to advance toward Wairopi. The little-used track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure was long. Soldiers of the 128th Inf Regt on the move at Wanigela as they head towards Buna. The 32nd established a position at Kalikodobu, nicknamed \\"Kalamazoo\\" by the GIs, a short distance along the track. From here, the main body of the 2nd Battalion departed on 14 October 1942. The battalion had assembled at Jaure by 28 October. The Americans were utterly unprepared for the extremely harsh conditions they faced which significantly delayed their advance. The planned envelopment of the Japanese forces never took place due to both the slow rate of the American advance and the unexpected, rapid withdrawal of the Japanese forces. While the 2/126th crawled over the Kapa Kapa Track, the balance of the 32nd Division was flown to newly developed advance airfields on the north side of the island. The 128th Regiment was flown to the most forward of these, located at Wanigella. From there, troops moved overland toward Buna or were ferried part of the way in coastal vessels, to meetup with Australian forces advancing on the Japanese beachheads. The first units of the 2/126th arrived in Soputa on 20 November 1942. A similar proposal for attacking the Japanese rear near Wairopi was made by Brigadier Potts, following withdrawal of the 21st Brigade after Ioribaiwa. Chaforce, raised from battalions of the 21st Brigade (each contributing a company) was to be assigned the task of penetrating from Myola into the Kumusi River valley. With initial approval to advance to Myola, the operation was subsequently cancelled sometime shortly after 18 October 1942. Aftermath =Subsequent events= The Japanese at Buna‚ÄìGona were reinforced by fresh units from Rabaul. The joint Australian‚ÄìUnited States Army operation faced a formidable defence that had been prepared well in advance of their arrival and the battle lasted until 22 January 1943. The 39th Battalion participated in the fighting at the beachheads and, following its withdrawal, was only able to parade about 30 members ‚Äì its ranks having been greatly depleted by injury and illness. In March 1943 it was withdrawn back to Australia where it was disbanded in July 1943. While this campaign, Milne Bay and the sea battles of Coral Sea and Midway ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn the citizenry until mid-1943, that an invasion was possible. Allied operations against Japanese forces in New Guinea, including Operation Cartwheel and the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign, continued into 1945. =Strengths and casualties= A total of 13,500 Japanese were ultimately landed in Papua for the fighting during the campaign. Of these, about 6,000 or two regiments, were directly involved in the \\"forward areas\\" along the Track. Against this, the Allies assembled approximately 30,000 troops in New Guinea, although at any one time no more than one infantry brigade, or approximately 3,500 troops, were involved in the fighting for most of the campaign. In terms of total troops committed over the course of the campaign, author Peter Williams estimates that \\"more than twice as many Australians than Japanese fought on the Kokoda Track\\". Private Vasil (Basil) Albert 'Babe' Lucas initially enlisted on 20 June 1940, aged 15 and was killed in action on 25 November 1942. (AWM P00322.009) Casualties amongst the Australians between 22 July and 16 November 1942 were 39 officers and 586 men killed and a further 64 officers and 991 men wounded, for a total of 625 killed and 1,055 wounded. Notably, three battalion commanders were killed or captured in the first month of fighting. Non-battle, or sickness, casualties are not accurately recorded but are stated to have been about two to three times the battle casualty figure. The exact number of Japanese casualties is not known, although Williams estimates battle casualties at 2,050 between the initial fighting around Awala and the final battle at Oivi‚ÄìGorari. Non-battle casualties, however, increase this figure and it is estimated that of the 6,000 troops, or five infantry battalions, that were committed to the fighting, up to 75% became casualties, being either killed, wounded or becoming ill. =War crimes= During the Tokyo War Crimes trial after the war, there was not enough evidence to bring formal charges with regard to the claims of cannibalism by Japanese soldiers. Some Japanese soldiers were tried and convicted in Australian-run military courts held in New Guinea. The Japanese were also responsible for the torture and execution of both combatant and non-combatant personnel including two female missionaries, May Hayman and Mavis Parkinson, during the campaign. Though not limited to the early stages of the campaign, McCarthy recounts events in the initial phase of the Kokoda campaign. All of the Australian servicemen captured during the course of the campaign were executed. Australian soldiers also treated their opponents harshly. Most took a \\"no quarter\\" attitude, and killed Japanese personnel rather than attempt to take them prisoner in the infrequent occasions where Japanese troops attempted to surrender. Despite official instructions against doing so, Australian soldiers often took the personal possessions of dead Japanese and there were several instances where gold teeth were taken from corpses. These attitudes were influenced by a view that the Japanese were deceitful, a desire to exact revenge for atrocities committed against Allied personnel (including the killing of prisoners of war) and latent racism. =Nomenclature= There is some debate as to whether the correct name for the route over the range is the \\"Kokoda Track\\" or \\"Kokoda Trail\\". The battle honour awarded for the campaign, as determined by the Battlefields Nomenclature Committee, is \\"Kokoda Trail\\". The Australian War Memorial has adopted \\"Trail\\", largely for this reason. Despite the historical use of \\"Trail\\", \\"Track\\" gained dominance in the 1990s, with the Australian Macquarie Dictionary stating that while both versions were in use, Kokoda Track \\"appears to be the more popular of the two\\". Battle honours For eligible Australian units, the battle honour \\"Kokoda Trail\\" was bestowed. Seven subsidiary honours were also bestowed. The honour, \\"Kokoda‚ÄìDeniki\\" was awarded to the 39th Battalion and the Pacific Islands Regiment, which succeeded the PIB. The honour, \\"Efogi‚ÄìMenari\\" was awarded for engagements between 6‚Äì9 September and included the battle at Brigade Hill‚ÄìMission Ridge. Other honours were: \\"Isurava\\", \\"Eora Creek‚ÄìTempleton's Crossing I\\", \\"Ioribaiwa\\", \\"Eora Creek‚ÄìTempleton's Crossing II\\" and \\"Oivi‚ÄìGorari\\". The 53rd Battalion did not receive any battle honour for the fighting during the Kokoda Track campaign. =Significance of the campaign= Bomana War Cemetery, near Port Moresby, where Australians killed in the campaign have been buried While the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I was Australia's first military test as a new nation, the fighting during the Kokoda campaign represents the first time in the nation's history that its security was directly threatened. The 1942 newsreel documentary, Kokoda Front Line! documented the Australian fighting during the campaign and brought the war home for many Australians. Filmed by Damien Parer, it won an Oscar for the documentary category ‚Äì the first time an Australian film/documentary was awarded an Oscar. Curator, Poppy De Souza, observes: \\"This iconic newsreel contains some of the most recognised images of Australian troops in the Second World War, images that have contributed to the collective visual memory of the events at Kokoda. ...[quoting Parer] a war that seemed until this point 'a million miles away‚Äô\\". Although it has since become accepted that an invasion of Australia was not possible, or even planned by the Japanese, at the time there was a very real belief within Australia that this was possible and as such the Kokoda campaign has come to be viewed by some as the battle that \\"saved Australia\\". As a result, within the collective Australian psyche, the campaign and particularly the role of the 39th Battalion has become a key part of modern notions of the Anzac legend. Indeed, the Battle of Isurava has been described as \\"Australia's Thermopylae\\", although the key premise of this comparison‚Äîthe idea that the Australians were outnumbered‚Äîhas since been shown to be inaccurate. Nevertheless, the Allied campaign was hampered by the poor intelligence available, which included antiquated maps, unfamiliarity with the terrain, and limited aerial photography. Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the extraordinarily difficult terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground. In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua‚Äîwidely criticised at the time‚Äîled to an eventual, though costly, victory. The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that \\"the only result, strategically speaking\\" of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua \\"was that after six months of bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the South West Pacific Area was exactly where it would have been the previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there\\". More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign. The campaign also served to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual soldiers and the lower level commanders. Following this and the fighting that followed at Buna‚ÄìGona, the American and Australian armies would take steps to improve individual and unit training and medical and logistic infrastructure would also be greatly improved, with an increased focus upon air transport to solve the supply problem. Within the Australian Army, there was a major restructure with the formation of Jungle divisions which addressed manpower issues and were more suited to operations in jungle environments. There was a significant reduction in the scale of motor transport, and Jeeps, with greater cross-country mobility, were employed rather than trucks. At battalion level, changes included increasing the number of mortars to eight, the addition of a machine gun platoon with four Vickers guns to enhance organic fire support, and a removal of the carrier platoon. The Land Warfare Centre, as it is now known, was established at Canungra, Queensland, with an emphasis on training for jungle warfare. Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force.

He is known primarily as a member of the household and workshop of painter Diego Vel√°zquez, who freed him in 1650. His 1661 work The Calling of Saint Matthew (sometimes also referred to as The Vocation of Saint Matthew) is on display at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. Biography Juan de Pareja was a Spaniard born into slavery in Southern Spain, probably in Antequera in Malaga province around 1610. Little is known on his background although Antonio Palomino describes him as a morisco (convert from Islam), being \\"of mixed parentage and unusual color.\\"Palomino, Antonio (1988). El museo pict√≥rico y escala √≥ptica III. El parnaso espa√±ol pintoresco laureado. Madrid : Aguilar S.A. de Ediciones The first known reference to Juan Pareja as a painter is in a letter addressed to Pedro Galindo, attorney of the city of Seville, written on the 12th of May 1630, in which Juan Pareja requests permission to move to Madrid in order to continue his studies together with his brother Jusepe. The autenthicity of this document is questioned since within it he claims to be a free man and does not once mention Vel√°zquez. It is unknown in which moment he began serving Vel√°zquez. In 1642 he signed as a witness in a power of attorney for Vel√°zquez in a lawsuit against scribes in the criminal court. He was also a witness in October and December 1647, for two other powers of attorney to manage his assets in Seville granted by Vel√°zquez and his wife Juana Pacheca. He would again sign a similar document on 1653 for Francisca Vel√°zquez, daughter of the painter. Corpus velazque√±o, pp. 182-185 y 290. In 1649 he accompanied Vel√°zquez on his second trip to Italy. This is where Vel√°zquez painted his famous painting \\"Portrait of Juan de Pareja\\", currently in the Museum of Metropolitan Art of New York. The painting was exposed in the Pantheon of Rome in March 1650 during the festivities in honor of the Patron of the Virtuosos of the Pantheon, which Vel√°zquez had recently joined. On the 23rd of November, while still in Rome, Vel√°zquez granted him letter of freedom, which would come into effect after four years on the condition that he did not escape or commit any criminal act in that period. The document of his manumission, discovered by Jennifer Montagu, is held in the Archivio di Stato in Rome.Burlington Magazine, volume 125, 1983, pp. 683-4 From then on until his death in Madrid he worked as an independent painter, demonstrating knowledge acquired in Velazquez's workshop, where he likely had wider responsibilities than Palomino suggests, as well as his knowledge of various other Spanish and Italian painters.

In April 1917, an ordinary piece of plumbing chosen by Duchamp was submitted for an exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, the inaugural exhibition by the Society to be staged at The Grand Central Palace in New York. In Duchamp's presentation, the urinal's orientation was altered from its usual positioning.Gavin Parkinson, The Duchamp Book: Tate Essential Artists Series, Harry N. Abrams, 2008, p. 61, Dalia Judovitz, Unpacking Duchamp: Art in Transit, University of California Press, 1998, pp. 124, 133, Fountain was not rejected by the committee, since Society rules stated that all works would be accepted from artists who paid the fee, but the work was never placed in the show area.Cabanne, P., & Duchamp, M. (1971). Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp Following that removal, Fountain was photographed at Alfred Stieglitz's studio, and the photo published in The Blind Man. The original has been lost. The work is regarded by art historians and theorists of the avant-garde as a major landmark in 20th-century art. Sixteen replicas were commissioned from Duchamp in the 1950s and 1960s and made to his approval. Some scholars have suggested that the original work was by an unidentified female artist who had submitted it to her friend Duchamp, but historians generally believe that Duchamp was solely responsible for Fountain's presentation.

L. Mott Iron Works, 118 Fifth Avenue. The artist brought the urinal to his studio at 33 West 67th Street, reoriented it 90 degrees from its originally intended position of use,To achieve an orientation resembling the photograph, an additional rotation by 180¬∞ about a vertical axis is necessary.

After much debate by the board members (most of whom did not know Duchamp had submitted it) about whether the piece was or was not art, Fountain was hidden from view during the show.Cabanne, Dialogs with Marcel Duchamp, p. 55 Duchamp resigned from the Board, and \\"withdrew\\" Tulip Hysteria Co-ordinating in protest. \\"Fountain\\", wrote the committee, \\"may be a very useful object in its place, but its place is not an art exhibition, and it is by no definition, a work of art.\\"Unsigned review, \\"His Art Too Crude for Independents\\", The New York Herald, 14 April 1917 (cited in Camfield, 1989, op.cit., 27) For this reason the work was \\"suppressed\\" (Duchamp's expression). > No, not rejected.

(Marcel Duchamp, 1971)Cabanne, Pierre, & Duchamp, Marcel, > Dialogues With Marcel Duchamp, Hudson, 1971, translated from French by Ron > Padgett, De Capo Press, archive.org The New York Dadaists stirred controversy about Fountain and its being rejected in the second issue of The Blind Man which included a photo of the piece and a letter by Alfred Stieglitz, and writings by Louise Norton, Beatrice Wood and Arensberg.The Blind Man, Vol. 2, 1917, p. 5. An editorial, possibly written by Wood, accompanying the photograph, entitled \\"The Richard Mutt Case\\",Tomkins, Duchamp: A Biography, p. 185. made a claim that would prove to be important concerning certain works of art that would come after it: In defense of the work being art, the piece continues, \\"The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges.\\" Duchamp described his intent with the piece was to shift the focus of art from physical craft to intellectual interpretation. In a letter dated 23 April 1917, Stieglitz wrote of the photograph he took of Fountain: \\"The \\"Urinal\\" photograph is really quite a wonder‚ÄîEveryone who has seen it thinks it beautiful‚ÄîAnd it's true‚Äîit is. It has an oriental look about it‚Äîa cross between a Buddha and a Veiled Woman.\\"Naumann, Francis M., The Recurrent, Haunting Ghost: Essays on the Art, Life and Legacy of Marcel Duchamp, New York, 2012, pp. 70‚Äì81 In 1918, Mercure de France published an article attributed to Guillaume Apollinaire stating Fountain, originally titled \\"le Bouddha de la salle de bain\\" (Buddha of the bathroom), represented a sitting Buddha.Guillaume Apollinaire, Le Cas de Richard Mutt, Mercure de France, 16 June 1918, Gallica, Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. The motive invoked for its refusal at the Independents were that the entry was (1) immoral and vulgar, (2) it was plagiarism, a commercial piece of plumbing. R. Mutt responded, according to Apollinaire, that the work was not immoral since similar pieces could be seen every day exposed in plumbing and bath supply stores. On the second point, R. Mutt pointed out that the fact Fountain was not made by the hand of the artist was unimportant. The importance was in the choice made by the artist. The artist chose an object of every-day life, erased its usual significance by giving it a new title, and from this point of view, gave a new purely esthetic meaning to the object. Menno Hubregtse argues that Duchamp may have chosen Fountain as a readymade because it parodied Robert J. Coady's exaltation of industrial machines as pure forms of American art. Coady, who championed his call for American art in his publication The Soil, printed a scathing review of Jean Crotti's Portrait of Marcel Duchamp (Sculpture Made to Measure) in the December 1916 issue. Hubregtse notes that Duchamp's urinal may have been a clever response to Coady's comparison of Crotti's sculpture with \\"the absolute expression of a‚Äîplumber.\\"Quoted in Hubregtse, \\"Robert J. Coady's The Soil and Marcel Duchamp's Fountain,\\" 32 Some have contested that Duchamp created Fountain, but rather assisted in submitting the piece to the Society of Independent Artists for a female friend. In a letter dated 11 April 1917 Duchamp wrote to his sister Suzanne: \\"Une de mes amies sous un pseudonyme masculin, Richard Mutt, avait envoy√© une pissoti√®re en porcelaine comme sculpture\\" (\\"One of my female friends under a masculine pseudonym, Richard Mutt, sent in a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.\\")Marcel Duchamp to Suzanne, 11 April 1917.

Francis M. Naumann and Hector Obalk (Ghent: Ludion Press, 2000), p. 47 Duchamp never identified his female friend, but three candidates have been proposed: an early appearance of Duchamp's female alter ego Rrose S√©lavy; the Dadaist Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven;Robert Reiss, \\"My Baroness: Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\\" in New York Dada, edited by Rudolf E. Kuenzli (New York: Willis Locker & Owens, 1986), pages 81‚Äì101. or Louise Norton (a Dada poet and a close friend of Duchamp, later married to the avant- garde French composer Edgard Var√®se),David M. Lubin, Grand Illusions: American Art and the First World War, Oxford University Press, 2016, who contributed an essay to The Blind Man discussing Fountain, and whose address is partially discernible on the paper entry ticket in the Stieglitz photograph.Francis M. Naumann, New York Dada, 1915‚Äì23 (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1994), p. 239, note 17. On one hand, the fact that Duchamp wrote 'sent' not 'made', does not indicate that someone else created the work. Furthermore, there is no documentary or testimonial evidence that suggests von Freytag created Fountain. Shortly after its initial exhibition, Fountain was lost. According to Duchamp biographer Calvin Tomkins, the best guess is that it was thrown out as rubbish by Stieglitz, a common fate of Duchamp's early readymades.Quoted in The reaction engendered by Fountain continued for weeks following the exhibition submission. An article was published in Boston on 25 April 1917: Duchamp began making miniature reproductions of Fountain in 1935, first in papier-m√¢ch√© and then in porcelain, for his multiple editions of a miniature museum 'retrospective' titled Bo√Æte-en-valise or 'box in a suitcase', 1935‚Äì66. The first 1:1 reproduction of Fountain was authorized by Duchamp in 1950 for an exhibition in New York; two more individual pieces followed in 1953 and 1963, and then an artist's multiple was manufactured in an edition of eight in 1964.Essay on Fountain These editions ended up in a number of important public collections; Indiana University Art Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Canada, Centre Georges Pompidou and Tate Modern. The edition of eight was manufactured from glazed earthenware painted to resemble the original porcelain, with a signature, reproduced in black paint. Interpretations Of all the artworks in this series of readymades, Fountain is perhaps the best known because the symbolic meaning of the toilet takes the conceptual challenge posed by the readymades to their most visceral extreme.See Similarly, philosopher Stephen Hicks argued that Duchamp, who was quite familiar with the history of European art, was obviously making a provocative statement with Fountain: :The artist is a not great creator‚ÄîDuchamp went shopping at a plumbing store. The artwork is not a special object‚Äîit was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling‚Äîat best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one with a sense of distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on. Since the photograph taken by Stieglitz is the only image of the original sculpture, there are some interpretations of Fountain by looking not only at reproductions but this particular photograph. Tomkins notes: :\\"Arensberg had referred to a 'lovely form' and it does not take much stretching of the imagination to see in the upside-down urinal's gently flowing curves the veiled head of a classic Renaissance Madonna or a seated Buddha or, perhaps more to the point, one of Br√¢ncu»ôi's polished erotic forms.\\"Julia D√ºr, Glasswanderers, If that‚Äôs art, I‚Äôm a Hottentott, Tout-fait, Vol. 2, Issue 5, April 2003, Succession Marcel Duchamp The meaning (if any) and intention of both the piece and the signature \\"R. Mutt\\", are difficult to pin down precisely. It is not clear whether Duchamp had in mind the German \\"Armut\\" (meaning \\"poverty\\"), or possibly \\"Urmutter\\" (meaning ‚Äúgreat mother‚Äù). The name R. Mutt could also be a play on its commercial origins or on the famous comic strip of the time, Mutt and Jeff (making the urinal perhaps the first work of art based on a comic).Francis M. Naumann, Beth Venn, Making mischief: Dada invades New York, Harry N. Abrams, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 20. Duchamp said the R stood for Richard, French slang for \\"moneybags\\", which makes Fountain a kind of scatological golden calf. Rhonda Roland Shearer in the online journal Tout-Fait (2000) suspects that the Stieglitz photograph is a composite of different photos, while other scholars such as William Camfield have never been able to match the urinal shown in the photo to any urinals found in the catalogues of the time period. In a 1964 interview with Otto Hahn, Duchamp suggested he purposefully selected a urinal because it was disagreeable. The choice of a urinal, according to Duchamp, \\"sprang from the idea of making an experiment concerned with taste: choose the object which has the least chance of being liked. A urinal‚Äîvery few people think there is anything wonderful about a urinal.\\"Hahn, Otto, Marcel Duchamp, L'Express, Paris, No. 684, 23 July 1964, p. 22. Quoted in Arturo Schwarz, The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp, New York, Abrams, 1970, p. 466 Rudolf E. Kuenzli states, in Dada and Surrealist Film (1996), after describing how various readymades are presented or displayed: \\"This decontextualization of the object's functional place draws attention to the creation of its artistic meaning by the choice of the setting and positioning ascribed to the object.\\" He goes on to explain the importance of naming the object (ascribing a title). At least three factors came into play: the choice of object, the title, and how it was modified, if at all, from its 'normal' position or location. By virtue of placing a urinal on a pedestal in an art exhibition, the illusion of an artwork was created.Rudolf E. Kuenzli, Dada and Surrealist Film, MIT Press, 1996, p. 47, Duchamp drew an ink copy of the 1917 Stieglitz photograph in 1964 for the cover of an exhibition catalogue, Marcel Duchamp: Ready-mades, etc., 1913‚Äì1964. The illustration appeared as a photographic negative. Later, Duchamp made a positive version, titled Mirrorical Return (Renvoi miroirique; 1964). Dalia Judovitz writes: > Structured as an emblem, the visual and linguistic elements set up a punning > interplay that helps us to explore further the mechanisms that Fountain > actively stages. On the one hand, there is the mirror-effect of the drawing > and the etching, which although they are almost identical visually, involve > an active switch from one artistic medium to the other. On the other hand, > there is the internal mirrorical return of the image itself, since this > urinal, like the one in 1917, has been rotated ninety degrees. This internal > rotation disqualifies the object from its common use as a receptacle, and > reactivates its poetic potential as a fountain; that is, as a machine for > waterworks. The \\"splash\\" generated by Fountain is thus tied to its > \\"mirrorical return,\\" like the faucet in the title. During the 1950s and 1960s, as Fountain and other readymades were rediscovered, Duchamp became a cultural icon in the world of art, exemplified by a \\"deluge of publications\\", as Camfield noted, \\"an unparalleled example of timing in which the burgeoning interest in Duchamp coincided with exhilarating developments in avant-garde art, virtually all of which exhibited links of some sort to Duchamp.\\" His art was transformed from \\"a minor, aberrant phenomenon in the history of modern art to the most dynamic force in contemporary art.\\" Legacy In December 2004, Duchamp's Fountain was voted the most influential artwork of the 20th century by 500 selected British art world professionals. Second place was afforded to Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and third to Andy Warhol's Marilyn Diptych (1962). The Independent noted in a February 2008 article that with this single work, Duchamp invented conceptual art and \\"severed forever the traditional link between the artist's labour and the merit of the work\\". Jerry Saltz wrote in The Village Voice in 2006: =Interventions= An inexact Fountain replica, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Several performance artists have attempted to \\"contribute\\" to the piece by urinating in it. South African born artist Kendell Geers rose to international notoriety in 1993 when, at a show in Venice, he urinated into Fountain. Artist / musician Brian Eno declared he successfully urinated in Fountain while it was exhibited in the MoMA in 1993. He admitted that it was only a technical triumph because he needed to urinate in a tube in advance so he could convey the fluid through a gap between the protective glass. Swedish artist Bj√∂rn Kjelltoft urinated in Fountain at Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1999.√Örets st√∂rsta konsth√§ndelse In spring 2000, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, two performance artists, who in 1999 had jumped on Tracey Emin's installation-sculpture My Bed in the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain, went to the newly opened Tate Modern and tried to urinate on the Fountain which was on display. However, they were prevented from soiling the sculpture directly by its Perspex case. The Tate, which denied that the duo had succeeded in urinating into the sculpture itself, banned them from the premises stating that they were threatening \\"works of art and our staff.\\" When asked why they felt they had to add to Duchamp's work, Chai said, \\"The urinal is there ‚Äì it's an invitation. As Duchamp said himself, it's the artist's choice. He chooses what is art. We just added to it.\\" On January 4, 2006, while on display in the Dada show in the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Fountain was attacked by Pierre Pinoncelli, a 76-year-old French performance artist, most noted for damaging two of the eight copies of Fountain.

Life magazine referred to him as \\"perhaps the world's most eminent Dadaist\\", Dada's \\"spiritual leader\\", \\"Dada's Daddy\\" in a lengthy article published 28 April 1952.Winthrop Sargeant, Dada's Daddy, A new tribute is paid to Duchamp, pioneer on nonsense and nihilism, Life, 28 April 1952, pp. 100‚Äì111 By the mid-50s his readymades were present in permanent collections of American museums. In 1961, Duchamp wrote a letter to fellow Dadaist Hans Richter in which he supposedly said: Richter, however, years later claimed those words were not by Duchamp. Richter had sent Duchamp this paragraph for comment, writing: \\"You threw the bottle rack and the urinal into their face‚Ä¶,\\" etc. Duchamp simply wrote: \\"Ok, √ßa va tr√®s bien\\" (\\"Ok, that works very well\\") in the margins.Hans Richter, Begegnungen von Dada bis Heute, K√∂ln, DuMont: pp. 155ff. Contrary to Richter's quote, Duchamp wrote favorably of Pop art in 1964, though indifferent to the humor or materials of Pop artists: Art market The prices for replicas, editions, or works that have some ephemeral trace of Duchamp reached its peak with the purchase of one of the eight 1964 replicas of Fountain.Marquis, Marcel Duchamp: The Bachelor Stripped Bare A Biography, p. 5. 17 November 1999, a version of Fountain (owned by Arturo Schwarz) was sold at Sotheby's, New York, for $1,762,500 to Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who declared that Fountain represented 'the origin of contemporary art'. The price set a world record, at the time, for a work by Marcel Duchamp at public auction.Francis M.

Biography =Early life= Samuel Hamersley was born in Guildford, Western Australia on 12 October 1842. The Hamersleys were a well connected family, and he was related by blood or marriage to a number of prominent Western Australian farmers and politicians. His father, Edward, was one of the leading Western Australian landholders of his day; his brother Edward also became a Member of the Legislative Council; William Locke Brockman was his uncle; his sister Margaret married Sir John Forrest; and his wife Matilda was sister to Maitland Brown. At the age of one, he went with his family to France. The family returned to Western Australia in 1850, building a home in Guildford. In his youth, he farmed in Toodyay, York and Swan Districts under a system of tenant farming. =Career= In 1863, he was a member of an exploring expedition to the Glenelg River. From about 1865 until 1868, he managed the family's Richmond property at Williams; he then spend some time at Wungong in the Canning district, before returning to Guildford in 1870. In 1873, he was running a butchering business, and in 1875 he inherited his father's Haseley property in Toodyay. Western Australia having obtained representative government in 1870, he stood for election in 1874, and on 2 October, he was elected to the Legislative Council seat of Murray and Williams. He held the seat until 12 February 1880, when he was succeeded by Septimus Burt. In February 1889, he contested the seat of Toodyay but was defeated by the incumbent George Shenton. The following May, he won the seat of Swan in a by- election, but was only required to hold it for five months before the Legislative Council was reformed with the advent of responsible government. =Personal life and death= In 1865, he married Matilda Brown, daughter of Thomas Brown and sister to Maitland and Kenneth. They had three sons and three daughters; one of his sons was Vernon Hamersley, who became the longest- serving Member of the Legislative Council ever. He died on 1 October 1896 in Guildford, Western Australia.

The work is widely regarded as a Modernist classic and has become one of the most famous of its time. Before its first presentation at the 1912 Salon des Ind√©pendants in Paris it was rejected by the Cubists as being too Futurist. It was then exhibited with the Cubists at Galeries Dalmau's Exposici√≥ d'Art Cubista, in Barcelona, 20 April‚Äì10 May 1912.Roger Allard, Sur quelques peintre, Les Marches du Sud-Ouest, June 1911, pp. 57-64. In Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914, The University of Chicago Press, 2008 The painting was subsequently shown, and ridiculed, at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City. Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 was reproduced by Guillaume Apollinaire in his 1913 book, Les Peintres Cubistes, M√©ditations Esth√©tiques. It is now in the Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.The Philadelphia Museum of Art Description √âtienne-Jules Marey: Man Walking, 1890-91 The work, an oil painting on canvas with dimensions of 147 cm √ó 89.2 cm (57.9 in √ó 35.1 in) in portrait, seemingly depicts a figure demonstrating an abstract movement in its ochres and browns. The discernible \\"body parts\\" of the figure are composed of nested, conical and cylindrical abstract elements, assembled together in such a way as to suggest rhythm and convey the movement of the figure merging into itself. Dark outlines limit the contours of the body while serving as motion lines that emphasize the dynamics of the moving figure, while the accented arcs of the dotted lines seem to suggest a thrusting pelvic motion. The movement seems to be rotated counterclockwise from the upper left to the lower right corner, where the gradient of the apparently frozen sequence corresponding to the bottom right to top left dark, respectively, becomes more transparent, the fading of which is apparently intended to simulate the \\"older\\" section. At the edges of the picture, the steps are indicated in darker colors. The center of the image is an amalgam of light and dark, that becomes more piqued approaching the edges. The overall warm, monochrome bright palette ranges from yellow ochre to dark, almost black tones. The colors are translucent. At the bottom left Duchamp placed the title \\"NU DESCENDANT UN ESCALIER\\" in block letters, which may or may not be related to the work. The question of whether the figure represents a human body remains unanswered; the figure provides no clues to its age, individuality, or character, while the gender of \\"nu\\" is male. Background Modern GIF of Eadweard Muybridge: Woman Walking Downstairs ‚Äì 1887 Corresponding still photos by Eadweard Muybridge The painting combines elements of both the Cubist and Futurist movements. In the composition, Duchamp depicts motion by successive superimposed images, similar to stroboscopic motion photography. Duchamp also recognized the influence of the chronophotography of √âtienne-Jules Marey and others, particularly Muybridge's Woman Walking Downstairs from his 1887 picture series, published as The Human Figure in Motion. Duchamp submitted the work to appear with the Cubists at the 28th exhibition of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, Paris, 25 March through 16 May 1912. It appeared under the number 1001 of the catalogue, entitled simply Nu descendant l'escalier, not Nu descendant un escalier n¬∞ 2. This catalogue revealed the title of the painting to the general public for the first time, even though the painting itself would be absent from the exhibition.Hommage √† Marcel Duchamp, Bo√Æte-en-catalogue, 1912‚Äì2012, Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, Nu descendant l‚Äôescalier Armory Show, 1913, the Cubist room, with works by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp and Alexander Archipenko, New York Tribune, 17 February 1913, p. 7 Duchamp's brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, sent by the hanging committee, asked him to voluntarily withdraw the painting, or paint over the title and rename it something else. According to Duchamp, Cubists such as Albert Gleizes found that his nude wasn't quite in line with what they had already investigated [trac√©e].Cabanne, Pierre, Ing√©nieur de temps perdu: entretiens [de Marcel Duchamp] avec Pierre Cabanne, Pierre Balfond, 1967Cabanne, Pierre, Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp, Da Capo Press, Aug 21, 1987 The hanging committee objected to the work, Duchamp stressed, on the grounds that it had \\"too much of a literary title\\", and that \\"one doesn't paint a nude descending a staircase, that's ridiculous... a nude should be respected\\".Dalia Judovitz, D√©plier Duchamp : passages de l'art, Presses Univ. Septentrion, Jan 1, 2000, p. 29 √âtienne-Jules Marey, Cheval blanc mont√©, 1886, locomotion du cheval, exp√©rience 4, Chronophotographie sur plaque fixe It was also believed that the descending nude came too close to the influences of Italian Futurism. Although the Section d'Or Cubists tolerated and even enjoyed the presence of foreign artists (e.g., Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Franti≈°ek Kupka, Alexander Archipenko, Amedeo Modigliani and Joseph Csaky), the French Cubists kept the door firmly closed to the influence of foreign trends. During the month of February 1912, a large Futurist exhibition was held in Paris at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune. Duchamp later denied the Futurist influence, claiming that the distance between Paris and Italy was too large for any tenable influences to occur.Kieran Lyons, Military Avoidance: Marcel Duchamp and the Jura-Paris Road, TATE Papers, Tate's online research journal.

The fact that I had seen chronophotographs of fencers in > action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) > gave me the idea for the Nude. It doesn't mean that I copied these > photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, > though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its > cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of > speed, was in the air.Stephen Kern, The Culture of Time and Space, > 1880‚Äì1918: With a New Preface, Harvard University Press, Nov 30, 2003 Duchamp later recalled of the relation between motion and his nude: > My aim was a static representation of movement, a static composition of > indications of various positions taken by a form in movement‚Äîwith no attempt > to give cinema effects through painting. The reduction of a head in movement > to a bare line seemed to me defensible.Note: After the 1912 Salon d‚ÄôAutomne, > the Cubists came under attack from Nationalist politicians in the French > National Assembly. Albert Gleizes mounted a defence in terms of their > straightforward patriotism. Further reading on the controversy: Kenneth > Silver, Esprit de Corps, Princeton 1989; David Cottington, Cubism in the > Shadow of War: the Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris 1905‚Äì1914, New Haven > 1998; Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century, > Yale University Press, New Haven, 2001 And with regard to the petition by the hanging committee of the Ind√©pendants: > I said nothing to my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took > my painting home in a taxi. It was really a turning point in my life, I can > assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after > that. Despite the controversy‚Äîwhether it was seen as such at the time or not‚Äîthe work was shown with its original title at the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie de la Bo√©tie, October 1912, and with the same group of artists that exhibited at the Ind√©pendants. His work also appeared in the illustrations to Du \\"Cubisme\\", and he participated in the La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), organized by the designer Andr√© Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Ind√©pendants). \\"The impression is\\", writes art historian Peter Brooke, \\"it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia\\".Peter Brooke, The 'rejection' of Nude Descending a Staircase It has been claimed (by others) that Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.

Walt Kuhn, Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Julian Street, an art critic for The New York Times wrote that the work resembled \\"an explosion in a shingle factory,\\" and cartoonists satirized the piece. It spawned dozens of parodies in the years that followed. A work entitled Food Descending a Staircase was exhibited at a show parodying the most outrageous works at the Armory, running concurrently with the show at The Lighthouse School for the Blind. In American Art News, there were prizes offered to anyone who could find the nude. After attending the Armory Show and seeing Marcel Duchamp's nude, President Theodore Roosevelt wrote: \\"Take the picture which for some reason is called 'A Naked Man Going Down Stairs'. There is in my bathroom a really good Navajo rug which, on any proper interpretation of the Cubist theory, is a far more satisfactory and decorative picture. Now, if, for some inscrutable reason, it suited somebody to call this rug a picture of, say, 'A Well-Dressed Man Going Up a Ladder', the name would fit the facts just about as well as in the case of the Cubist picture of the 'Naked Man Going Down Stairs'. From the standpoint of terminology each name would have whatever merit inheres in a rather cheap straining after effect; and from the standpoint of decorative value, of sincerity, and of artistic merit, the Navajo rug is infinitely ahead of the picture.\\"Mr. Roosevelt on the Cubists, The Literary Digest, April 5, 1913, p. 772  Provenance  During the Armory Show the painting was bought by the San Francisco lawyer and art dealer Frederic C. Torrey, who hung it in his home in Berkeley. In 1919, after commissioning a full-size copy of the work, Torrey sold the original to Louise and Walter Conrad Arensberg. In 1954 it entered the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art as a bequest from the Arensbergs. There it is displayed as part of the permanent collection alongside preliminary studies and a later copy by Duchamp.

The crew and passengers of the missing Concorde believe they are at Heathrow but are enslaved to work under guard of Plasmatons, humanoid blobs of protein held together by the psychokinetic field. One passenger, Professor Hayter, has seen through the illusion, and lets the Doctor know that they have been forced to work by the mystic Kalid to break into a central chamber at a nearby Citadel. As the Doctor sets off to see Kalid, Shapley and Hayter attempt to break the other humans free of the illusion, while Nyssa with her empathic abilities, is able to enter the central chamber freely along with Tegan to find the power source controlling the psychokinetic field. Nyssa briefly interrupts the power source, which causes Kalid's disguise to falter, revealing himself to the Doctor as the Master. The Master explains that he had been trapped in Earth's past after their last encounter, his own TARDIS damaged, and believed that he could repair it by acquiring the power source in the Citadel; he created the time corridor to obtain human slaves to help break the chamber open. However, now with the Doctor's TARDIS in his possession, the Master sets off in it to try to materialise in the central chamber. The Doctor finds that the humans have finally broken through the chamber, and he soon joins Nyssa and Tegan inside. They find that the power source is a gestalt intelligence of numerous Xeraphin. Their ship had crashed some time ago, and to survive against high radiation levels, they took the form of energy in the gestalt. However, when the Master arrived, his presence caused the gestalt to develop a split personality, some willing to help the Master while others fighting against him. The Master is unable to materialise the Doctor's TARDIS into the chamber but instead uses it to create an induction loop to transfer the gestalt to his TARDIS. On returning to his TARDIS, he finds that Stapley and Hayter have taken some of the key circuitry in their attempt to free the others, and he attempts to scavenge those parts from the Doctor's TARDIS. The Doctor proposes a truce, providing the spare parts including a temporal limiter, to repair the Master's TARDIS in exchange for dropping the psychokinetic field. The Master agrees, and quickly dematerialises when his TARDIS is ready. The Doctor ushers his companions and the freed humans to one of the Concordes, and uses his TARDIS to bring them back to the present at Heathrow. He reveals he programmed the temporal limiter to have the Master arrive later than they did, and thus is able to prevent the Master's TARDIS from rematerialising. Instead, as the Doctor had programmed, it will now rematerialise on the Xeraphin's home planet. After saying goodbye to Stapley and the rescued passengers, the Doctor and Nyssa leave. Tegan races out of the airport as the TARDIS vanishes, upset at being left behind. Production The Concorde used for the production was G-BOAC, the flagship of the BA fleet at the time. The registry can be read from the radar screen in the ATC scenes. The other registry, G-BAVF, was not a Concorde, but a Beechcraft 58 twin-engined light executive aircraft Although his character had been killed in the previous episode, Matthew Waterhouse's contract extended into the filming of Time-Flight, which is the reason for Adric's illusory appearance in Part Two. Tegan's apparent departure from the series was never intended to be permanent, but was planned as a sort of cliffhanger-ending to the 19th season. She would later return in the second episode of the next story, Arc of Infinity. =Cast notes= Peter Davison has said Time-Flight was the biggest disappointment from his time on the series, stating it was a \\"very good story, but we had run out of money. We filmed the prehistoric landscape of Heathrow airport in Studio 8 [at TV Centre] with a model Concorde in the back of the studio. The monsters were bits of foam. We didn't do the story justice.\\" In order to hide the Master's involvement in this story, the first episode did not credit Anthony Ainley as the Master. Instead, the credits and Radio Times listed \\"Leon Ny Taiy\\" (an anagram of \\"Tony Ainley\\") as playing Kalid. Keith Drinkel would later play Henry Hallam in the audio play Catch-1782. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Peter Grimwade, was published by Target Books in January 1983. =Home media= Time-Flight was released on VHS in July 2000. A double-pack DVD featuring both Time-Flight and Arc of Infinity was released on 6 August 2007. This serial was released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 135 on 5 March 2014.

They are composed of large amounts of extracellular matrix containing collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycan. Collagen type I and type III are abundant, but the collagen fibrils are formed abnormally. The presence of myomas is related with fertility. The presence of submucous myomas decreases fertility, and their removal increases fertility to baseline rates. Neither intramural nor subserosal myomas appear to affect fertility rates, and their removal has not been shown to increase fertility. Myomas in pregnancy can affect myoma growth, dependent on individual differences in genetics, circulating growth factors, and myoma-localized receptors. However, most myomas do not increase in size during pregnancy. Morover, 5% of myomas degenerates during pregnancy. https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(07)00221-X/fulltext#sec5 They are of two types. * The leiomyoma occurs in the skin or gut but the common form is the uterine fibroid. * Rhabdomyomas are rare tumors of muscles, they occur in childhood and often become malignant. Diagnosis Clinically significant subserosal and intramural myomas can usually be diagnosed by pelvic examination based on findings of an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus. However, the optimal selection of patients for medical therapy, noninvasive procedures, or surgery depends on an accurate assessment of the size, number, and position of myomas. The techniques available for confirming the diagnosis of myomas include sonography, saline-infusion sonography, hysteroscopy, and MRI. Transvaginal sonography is the most readily available and least costly technique and may be helpful for differentiating myomas from other pelvic conditions. Saline-infusion sonography uses saline inserted into the uterine cavity to provide contrast and better define submucous myomas, polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, or carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imagine is an excellent method to evaluate the size, position, and number of uterine myomas and is the best modality for exact evaluation of submucous myoma penetration into the myometrium. Magnetic resonance imaging may differentiate adenomyosis from myomas. https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(07)00221-X/fulltext#sec2.1 Treatment To remove the tumor from the body, a myomectomy or hysterectomy is often required, depending on the site and type of myoma.

Chisholm played as a central defender for Sunderland, Hibernian, Dundee and Partick Thistle. After retiring as a player, Chisholm became a coach, working in some of his roles as assistant to Ian McCall. Chisholm succeeded McCall as manager of Dundee United in 2005, and guided the club to the 2005 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 1‚Äì0 to Celtic. He was sacked the following season, however, and was subsequently appointed manager of Scottish First Division club Queen of the South. Chisholm guided the club to the 2008 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 3‚Äì2 to Rangers. Chisholm left Queens in 2010 to manage Dundee, but was made redundant when the club went into administration in October 2010. Playing career =In England= Chisholm started his career at Sunderland where he spent seven years and was a member of the side that reached the final of the Football League Cup in March 1985, where they lost 1‚Äì0 to Norwich City. Unfortunately for Chisholm, he deflected Asa Hartford's shot into the net for Norwich's winning goal. =In Scotland= Chisholm moved back to Scotland later that year, when he joined Hibernian for a ¬£60,000 fee.Jeffrey, pp36. He scored a goal on his Hibs debut, a Scottish League Cup semi-final win against Rangers. This meant that Chisholm achieved the unusual feat of playing in League Cup Finals in the same calendar year in both England and Scotland. Unfortunately for Chisholm, both finals were lost, as Hibs lost 3‚Äì0 to Aberdeen.http://qosfc.com/HeadlineNews/ViewFullStory/tabid/151/selectmoduleid/498/ArticleID/1124/reftab/36/Default.aspx \\"League Cup Doonhamers\\" on www.qosfc.com He later had spells at Dundee and Partick Thistle before retiring in 1992. Chisholm was a \\"tall, commanding central defender\\" who \\"could also play in the holding midfield role\\". Managerial career =Early managerial career= Chisholm had assistant manager roles at Partick Thistle, Clydebank, Ross County, Airdrie, Falkirk and Dundee United, primarily working with Ian McCall. =Dundee United= Chisholm was appointed as caretaker manager of Dundee United on 14 March 2005, following the sacking of Ian McCall. Chisholm suffered 3‚Äì2 defeats against both Celtic and Hibernian in his first two matches in charge. The following week, however, Chisholm's team triumphed over Hibernian, Rangers and Hearts. United then went on to end a run of eight games over three years without a win against neighbours Dundee, with goals by Mark Wilson and Jim McIntyre sealing a 2‚Äì1 win. These results meant that Chisholm won the SPL manager of the month award in his first full month in charge of the team (April 2005). Chisholm's team then retained SPL status in dramatic style with a late Barry Robson penalty at Inverness on the final day of the season. United's victory against Hibs meant that they reached the 2005 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 1‚Äì0 against Celtic. As Celtic had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, however, United qualified for the UEFA Cup. Chisholm was given the position of manager on a permanent basis on 24 May 2005. Despite spending considerable money on players such as Lee Miller, Dundee United were eliminated in the qualifying stage of the UEFA Cup by Finnish team MyPa. Poor league form and a 3‚Äì2 defeat against Aberdeen in the third round of the Scottish Cup, after having led 2‚Äì0, led to Chisholm being sacked on 10 January 2006 by Dundee United chairman Eddie Thompson. =Queen of the South= Semi final result on the scoreboard at Hampden Park Chisholm again became Ian McCall's assistant, this time at Dumfries club Queen of the South, until McCall's departure from the club at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Chisholm then accepted the role as manager, appointing Kenny Brannigan as his assistant manager. Chairman Davie Rae also announced that the club would become fully professional that season. In March 2008, Chisholm guided Queens to only their second ever Scottish Cup semi-final appearance with a 2‚Äì0 quarter final victory against Dundee, a game notable for a goal from 84 yards by Ryan McCann. Queens followed this with a 4‚Äì3 win against Aberdeen in the semi-final, which meant that Chisholm had guided Queens to their first ever Scottish Cup Final appearance. Despite second half Queens goals by Steve Tosh and Jim Thomson, Rangers ran out 3‚Äì2 winners in the Final. Queens finished fourth in the Scottish First Division.\\"Club History\\" on the official Queen of the South website As Rangers had already qualified for the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Champions League through their league position, Queens entered the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup competition. They were drawn in a qualification round against Danish club FC Nordsj√¶lland. The first leg, hosted at the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie, was played in a quagmire with the Danes running out 2‚Äì1 winners. Queens delivered a stronger performance in the return leg, controlling most of the game but with only one goal to show for their superiority. With a 1‚Äì0 victory of no value in an aggregate result due to the away goals rule and Queens pushing all out for the second goal, the Danes took advantage to score two goals in the last five minutes. Chisholm's team selection for the UEFA Cup ties caused some surprise. With Stephen Dobbie the most prolific striker at the club in a generation, Chisholm started with Dobbie on the bench for both ties instead preferring the workmanlike Stewart Kean.\\"Congratulations Stephen Dobbie\\" www.qosfc.com 30 May 2011 A strong start to the 2008‚Äì09 league campaign saw the club sitting top of the table in October.

The 2009‚Äì10 season progressed in a similar fashion to the season before. Queens were top of the table, but poorer results followed that dragged the club into a mid table position. The club also suffered a 4‚Äì0 defeat in the Scottish Cup against Airdrie.Results and fixtures Chisholm applied for the vacant managerial position at Kilmarnock,http://www.qosfc.com/HeadlineNews/ViewFullStory/tabid/151/selectmoduleid/498/ArticleID/1001/reftab/54/Default.aspx \\"The Kilmarnock scenario\\" but the job was taken by Jimmy Calderwood. Two months later, Chisholm was offered the vacant position at Dundee. Chisholm made the following comments after leaving QoS:http://www.qosfc.com/HeadlineNews/ViewFullStory/tabid/151/selectmoduleid/498/ArticleID/1127/reftab/36/Default.aspx 'Chis' takes over the 'hot seat' at Dundee\\" =Dundee= Chisholm took the Dundee job while they were top of the First Division, although the club had just sacked Jocky Scott after going four games without a win. Chisholm said ahead of his first game in charge, \\"It was an opportunity I just couldn't pass by at my time of life, but it will be a strange experience being on opposite sides tomorrow night.\\" Chisholm was the first person to manage both major Dundee clubs. Billy Dodds, who was the Queen of the South strikers coach under Chisholm, joined him at Dens Park as his assistant. Dundee failed to win promotion at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season and entered administration a few months later. The administrator made Chisholm and Dodds redundant the following day. =East Fife= After leaving Dundee in October 2010 and spending over a year out of professional football, Chisholm set up an estate agent business with his wife. In March 2012, Chisholm was appointed assistant manager of East Fife by Gordon Durie on a part-time basis. After Durie took ill during a game, Chisholm took control of the team. He resigned from his position at East Fife in October 2012 due to the pressures of combining both tasks and commuting from Lenzie to Methil. Chisholm was then appointed as international development coach with Sunderland.

The school is a part of Chesterfield County Public Schools. History In 1914, three schools consolidated to form Elkhardt School (eventually Elkhardt Middle School) at 6300 Hull Street Road, which had a faculty of four, including the principal. In 1916, the first public transportation to the school was provided by horse- drawn wagon. The name was changed to Manchester District High School in 1924, with the first graduating class, in 1925, consisting of eight students. Rapid population growth, following World War II, required that new facilities be built, and in fall 1964 the school was moved to 7401 Hull Street Road (now Manchester Middle School). Westward urban sprawl from the nearby city of Richmond, Virginia, required yet another move in 1992 to the current location at 12601 Bailey Bridge Road.Manchester High School at Public School Review Campus Manchester shares many of its facilities with the adjacent Bailey Bridge Middle School. It is home to Lloyd Swelnis Stadium, named after the long-time Manchester athletic director. In 2003 closed-circuit cameras were installed in the building and parking lots to provide better security for students and staff. An addition to the main building was completed in 2004 to house the Mass Communications and Spanish-Immersion Specialty Centers. Students Manchester High School has a diverse student body, consisting of approximately 1900 students, and is reflective of the multiple ethnicities present in Chesterfield County. The opening of Cosby High School in 2006, and the new location and recreation of Clover Hill High School has alleviated the over-crowding at Manchester High, allowing for the reduction in number of trailers previously used as classrooms. Activities Sports teams include baseball, basketball, football, cheerleading, volleyball, soccer, softball, field hockey, track and field, cross-country, tennis, wrestling, and golf. Notable clubs include a JROTC program, Foreign Language clubs, school news paper, Model UN, show choir, marching band, Red Cross and cheering.

Insurgentes has its origins in what was during the early 20th century known as the Via del Centenario which ran from city centre to the southern suburbs. Many decades later, after it was paved and widened, its name was changed to Avenida de los Insurgentes, apparently happening during the administration of President Miguel Alem√°n, when the area attracted wealthy urbanites for sophisticated, modern housing. The avenue was named after the Insurgent Army (Ej√©rcito de los Insurgentes) that fought for Mexican independence from Spain during the Mexican War of Independence from 1810 to 1821. The avenue's southern terminus is located near Volc√°n Ajusco in the intersection with the Viaducto Tlalpan avenue, where it becomes Highway 95 in direction to Cuernavaca. The northern terminus is located in the intersection with Avenida Acueducto where it becomes the highway to Pachuca. The avenue crosses five of the 16 boroughs of the city.

History  The APSP was founded in 1972 ‚Äî emerging from three earlier Black organisations in Florida, namely: the Junta of Militant Organizations (JOMO), the Black Rights Fighters, and the Black Study Group. JOMO, the most influential of the three organisations then led by Yeshitela, was a Black organisation protesting against racial discrimination, and racist police brutality and abuses against people of African descent in Florida, United States.

According to Klehr, the APSP styles its members as \\"true, genuine communists.\\" That same year (1972), the APSP adopted the oldest Black Power newspaper in the U.S. ‚Äî The Burning Spear Newspaper as its official publication.

The first party congress was held in Oakland in 1982. At that congress, the party passed a resolution to create the African Socialist International (ASI) organization. The ASI sought to be the \\"international party of the African working class\\", and has held conferences in various countries outside the United States. The APSP also founded the African National Reparations Organization in 1982, and the First World Tribunal on Reparations for African People was held in Brooklyn, New York.Araujo, Ana Lucia, Reparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade: A Transnational and Comparative History, Bloomsbury Publishing (2017), p. 159, (Retrieved 19 April 2019) On its official website, the APSP claims that \\"through this work, the African People's Socialist Party gave birth to the modern Reparations Movement.\\"The African People‚Äôs Socialist Party-USA official website. \\"History\\" : Founding of the African People's Socialist Party, (Retrieved 19 April 2019) Martin and Yaquinto however posits that, in the National Black Political Assembly's (NBPA) Black Agenda report published in 1974, the NBPA \\"endorsed the concept of African American reparations.\\" Citing Hakim (Hakim, I.

They were men who collected and processed trepang (also known as sea cucumber), a marine invertebrate prized for its culinary value generally and for its medicinal properties in Chinese markets. The term Makassan (or Macassan) is generally used to apply to all the trepangers who came to Australia. Some were from other islands in the Indonesian Archipelago, including Timor, Rote and Aru. Fishing and processing of trepang Mediterranean The creature and the food product are commonly known in English as sea cucumber, b√™che-de-mer in French, gamat in Malay, while Makassarese has 12 terms covering 16 different species. One of the Makassar terms, for trepang, taripa≈ã, entered the Aboriginal languages of the Cobourg Peninsula, as tharriba in Marrku, as jarripang in Mawng or otherwise as darriba. Trepang live on the sea floor and are exposed at low tide. Fishing was traditionally done by hand, spearing, diving or dredging. The catch was placed in boiling water before being dried and smoked, to preserve the trepang for the journey back to Makassar and other South East Asian markets. Trepang is still valued by Chinese communities for its jelly- like texture, its flavour-enhancing properties, and as a stimulant and aphrodisiac. Matthew Flinders made a contemporary record of how trepang was processed when he met Pobasso, a chief of a Makassan fleet in February 1803. Voyage to Marege' and Kayu Jawa Fishing fleets began to visit the northern coasts of Australia from Makassar in southern Sulawesi, Indonesia, from at least 1720 and possibly earlier. Campbell Macknight's classic study of the Makassan trepang industry accepts the start of the industry as about 1720, with the earliest recorded trepang voyage made in 1751. But Regina Ganter of Griffith University notes that a Sulawesi historian suggests a commencement date for the industry of about 1640. Ganter also notes that for some anthropologists, the extensive influence of the trepang industry on the Yolngu people suggests a longer period of contact. Arnhem Land Aboriginal rock art, recorded by archaeologists in 2008, appears to provide further evidence of Makassan contact in the mid-1600s. Based on radiocarbon dating for apparent prau (boat) designs in Aboriginal rock art, some scholars have proposed contact from as early as the 1500s. At the height of the trepang industry, the Makassan ranged thousands of kilometres along Australia's northern coasts, arriving with the north-west monsoon each December. Makassan perahu or praus could carry a crew of thirty members, and Macknight estimated the total number of trepangers arriving each year as about one thousand. The Makassan crews established themselves at various semi-permanent locations on the coast, to boil and dry the trepang before the return voyage home, four months later, to sell their cargo to Chinese merchants.Stephenson, P.(2010)Islam Dreaming: Indigenous Muslims in Australia. P.22-6. University of New South Wales Press, Sydney. Marege' was the Makassan name for Arnhem land (meaning \\"Wild Country\\"), from the Cobourg Peninsula to Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Kayu Jawa was the name for the fishing grounds in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, from Napier Broome Bay to Cape Leveque. Other important fishing areas included West Papua, Sumbawa, Timor and Selayar. Matthew Flinders, in his circumnavigation of Australia in 1803, met a Makassan trepang fleet near present-day Nhulunbuy. He communicated at length with a Makassan captain, Pobasso, through his cook, who was also a Malay, and learned of the extent of the trade from this encounter.

Using Daeng Rangka, the last Makassan trepanger to visit Australia, lived well into the 20th century, and the history of his voyages are well documented. He first made the voyage to northern Australia as a young man. He suffered dismasting and several shipwrecks, and had generally positive but occasionally conflicting relationships with Indigenous Australians. He was the first trepanger to pay the South Australian government for a trepanging licence in 1883, an impost that made the trade less viable (At the time this jurisdiction administered the Northern Territory). The trade continued to dwindle toward the end of the 19th century, due to the imposition of customs duties and licence fees and probably compounded by overfishing. Rangka commanded the last Makassar perahu, which left Arnhem Land in 1907. Physical evidence of Makassan contact Makassan stone arrangement near Yirrkala, Northern Territory. Photo by Ray Norris Archeological remains of Makassar processing plants from the 18th and 19th centuries are still at Port Essington, Anuru Bay and Groote Eylandt, along with stands of the tamarind trees introduced by the Makassan. Macknight and others note that excavations and development in these areas have revealed pieces of metal, broken pottery and glass, coins, fishhooks and broken clay pipes related to this trade. Macknight notes that much of the ceramic material found suggests a nineteenth- century date. In 1916, two bronze cannons were found on a small island in Napier Broome Bay, on the northern coast of Western Australia.

Effect on Indigenous people of Australia A female figure outlined in beeswax over painting of a white Makassan prau The Makassar contact with Aborigines had a significant effect on the latter culture, and likely there were also cross- cultural influences. Ganter writes \\"the cultural imprint on the Yolngu people of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine\\". According to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, the contact between the two groups was a success: \\"They traded together. It was fair ‚Äì there was no racial judgement, no race policy\\". Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect. Others who have studied this period have come to a different conclusion regarding the relationship between the aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. Anthropologist Ian McIntosh has said that the initial effects of contact with the Makassan fishermen resulted in \\"turmoil\\" with the extent of Islamic influence being noteworthy. In another paper McIntosh concludes, \\"strife, poverty and domination... is a previously unrecorded legacy of contact between Aborigines and Indonesians\\". A report prepared by the History Department of the Australian National University says that the Makassan appear to have been welcomed initially; however, relations deteriorated when, \\"aborigines began to feel they were being exploited... leading to violence on both sides\\". =Trade= Studies by anthropologists have found traditions that indicate the Makassan negotiated with local people on the Australian continent for the right to fish certain waters. The exchange also involved the trade of cloth, tobacco, metal axes and knives, rice, and gin. The Yolgnu of Arnhem Land also traded turtle-shell, pearls and cypress pine, and some were employed as trepangers.

Women were also occasional items of exchange according to Denise Russell, but their views and experiences have not been recorded.Russell, D.(2004) p.15 After visiting Groote Eylandt in the early 1930s, anthropologist Donald Thomson speculated that the traditional seclusion of women from strange men and their use of a portable bark screens in this region \\"may have been a result of contact with Macassans\\".Donald Thomson, Compiled and edited by Nicolas Peterson (2003): Donald Thomson in Arnhem Land.

Recent genetic studies showed that the Groote Eylandt families with MJD shared a Y-DNA haplogroup with some families of Taiwanese, Indian, and Japanese ancestry. =Economic= Some Yolngu communities of Arnhem Land appear to have re-figured their economies from being largely land-based to largely sea-based, following the introduction of Makassar technologies such as dug-out canoes, which were highly prized. These seaworthy boats, unlike the traditional Yolngu bark canoes, allowed the people to fish the ocean for dugongs and sea turtles. Macknight notes that both the dug-out canoe and shovel-nosed spear found in Arnhem Land were based on Macassarese prototypes. =Language= A Makassan pidgin became a lingua franca along the north coast, not just between Makassan and Aboriginal people, but also as a language of trade among different Aboriginal groups, who were brought into greater contact with each other by the seafaring Makassar culture. Words from the Makassarese language (related to Javanese and Indonesian) can still be found in Aboriginal language varieties of the north coast. Examples include rupiah (money), jama (work), and balanda (white person). The latter was adopted into the Makassar language via the Malay language term \\"orang belanda\\" (referring to Dutch person). =Religion= Drawing on the work of Ian Mcintosh (2000), Regina Ganter and Peta Stephenson suggest that aspects of Islam were creatively adapted by the Yolngu. Muslim references still survive in certain ceremonies and Dreaming stories in the early 21st century.Stephenson, P.(2010) p.31-34 Stephenson speculates that the Makassan may have been the first visitors to bring Islam to Australia.Stephenson, P (2004) \\"Islam in Indigenous Australia: Historic Relic or Contemporary Reality\\", in Politics and Culture, 2004, Issue 4.

Current situation Though prevented from fishing across Arnhem Land, other Indonesian fishermen have continued to fish up and down the west coast, in what are now Australian waters. This continues a practice of several hundred years, before such territories were declared ‚Äî and some use traditional boats that their grandparents owned. The current Australian government considered such fishing illegal by its rules. Since the 1970s, if the fishermen are caught by authorities, their boats are burned and the fishermen are deported to Indonesia. Most Indonesian fishing in Australian waters now occurs around what Australia coined \\"Ashmore Reef\\" (known in Indonesia as Pulau Pasir) and the nearby islands.Stacey, N.(2007) Boats to Burn, Bajo Fishing Activity in the Australian Fishing Zone.

First raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1917, he taught at his alma mater of the Athenaeum S. Apollinare from 1921 to 1932, and then entered the Roman Curia, as substitute adjunct of the Consistorial, on 16 December 1922. After holding a variety of pastoral and curial positions, Cicognani was appointed Apostolic Delegate to the United States and Titular Archbishop of Laodicea in Phrygia on 17 March 1933. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 23 April from Cardinal Raffaele Rossi, with Archbishops Giuseppe Pizzardo and Carlo Salotti serving as co-consecrators, in the Roman church of Santa Susanna. Cicognani would remain Apostolic Delegate to the United States, serving as liaison between the American hierarchy and the Vatican, for the next 25 years. During World War II, Cicognani expressed reservations about Zionism. In a letter dated 22 June 1943 to American representative Myron C. Taylor, he said: \\"It is true that at one time Palestine was inhabited by the Hebrew Race, but there is no axiom in history to substantiate the necessity of a people returning to a country they left nineteen centuries before ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ If a 'Hebrew Home' is desired, it would not be too difficult to find a more fitting territory than Palestine.

Because his brother, Gaetano, was already a living cardinal, having been elevated in 1953, an exception had to be made to the Church law that prohibited brothers from holding the title of cardinal simultaneously. On 14 November 1959, Cicognani became Secretary of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.

History  = Pre-formation and early years (1993‚Äì2000) = In 1993, drummer Trevor Reilly, guitarist John Carvalho and bassist Jonathan Teves formed the band Adam's Crack and recorded a Nirvana-inspired demo cassette. In 1994 Reilly and Carvalho started a side band with Nuno Pereira on vocals, and others. The side band played one show before disbanding. Members from the two bands would merge into one, taking the name Koen. The line-up of Koen consisted of Pereira (vocals), Reilly (drums), Teves (bass), Carvalho (guitar) and friend Mat Demelo (guitar and trumpet). Under the name Koen, the band released one cassette titled \\"The Big Fall...\\", this time with their sound evolving more into skate punk and ska. In 1997, the band changed its name again, this time to Smackin' Isaiah, and released a cassette titled \\"Give Girls More Beer...\\". Mat Demelo left the band shortly after. During this time, Reilly would switch between drumming and guitar duties, with an unknown drummer playing in the band for a brief amount of time. Nicholas Angelini was eventually tapped to play drums on a permanent basis. In 1998, Smackin' Isaiah released another demo cassette, titled \\"Gets Eaten Alive\\". = Tank Records era (2000‚Äì2001) = The band's first CD release was on Tank Records, a record label created by Carvalho and Teves. The CD was a split release with the bands Moronique and Merrick, entitled 6:6:6 after the number of tracks each band contributed. Soon after, the band released its debut album, The Way to a Girl's Heart Is Through Her Boyfriend's Stomach. The band considers this their first \\"real\\" release, as all the songs had been written after Angelini joined the band. In retrospect, they consider it their most cheerful record. It was reissued 2 years later on All About Records, but the band stayed with Tank Records to release its second album, Benefits Of Thinking Out Loud. During the album's recording, the band members had a strained relationship as they argued over its production. Six outtakes from the album's recording sessions were compiled onto an EP entitled The Champagne of Bands... We Know Sexy released by Fork in Hand Records. Following its release, Carvalho left the band. Christopher Levesque quickly replaced him. = Final name change and Nitro Records years (2002‚Äì2009) = With the band taking a more serious approach on Benefits, they decided to once more change their name, finally settling on A Wilhelm Scream. Signing with new label Jump Start Records, they re-released Benefits of Thinking Out Loud under their new name. After touring the United States and Canada a few times, they then began recording their next album, Mute Print, with Jump Start. For the recording of the album, the band decided to put \\"as much shit as you can possibly fit into a song and pull off live\\" into the songs, to which they attribute their faster, more aggressive and more technical sound. This album was recorded and produced by Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, whom the band looked up to. Although the album was finished while the band was signed to Jump Start, the rights to the album were then bought by Nitro Records, who released it in 2004. Only a year after Mute Print, the band released a second record on Nitro, again produced by Stevenson and Livermore. The record, entitled Ruiner, was released on August 16, 2005. Following stress from touring, founding member Jonathan Teves left the band, and was replaced by bassist Curtiss Lopez. They then embarked on their first European tour with Lagwagon, and also toured with Less Than Jake. Midway through the latter tour, Lopez abruptly quit the band. This left A Wilhelm Scream without a permanent bassist until Brian J. Robinson, former bassist of The Fullblast in April. The band continued to tour extensively throughout 2006. They also released a 7-inch EP titled Diver on Jump Start Records. This was because the title track was recorded during the Mute Print sessions, but left off the album, and thus was not purchased by Nitro Records. In 2007, the band returned to the Blasting Room again, with Stevenson and Livermore to record their third album with Nitro Records. The record, according to the band, was \\"very very fast\\" and a few songs were dropped for not being fast enough.\\"A Wilhelm Scream complete new album\\" Punknews.org The record, Career Suicide, was released on October 9, 2007. However, only two weeks before its street date, long-time guitarist Chris Levesque announced that he was leaving the band,\\"A Wilhelm Scream guitarist leaves band\\" Punknews.org.

The band began their tour in support of Career Suicide with several rotating guitarists, before Mike Supina, formerly of the Detroit-based band Alucard, was announced as Levesque's permanent replacement. The tour brought the band to over eighteen different countries, finishing in September 2008. Following its conclusion, guitarist Trevor Reilly announced in his blog that the band would take a break for the rest of the year, but implied that they would write new songs soon. In a post to celebrate the new year, the band released b-side \\"The I Hate ___ Club\\", which was left off the album at the producers' request.

Smith has been serving a life sentence since 1989 and is imprisoned in Lithgow Correctional Centre after he was moved from Long Bay Correctional Centre, New South Wales, where he spent 14 years of his life. Smith's bodyguard Graham 'Abo' Henry claimed in ABO - A Treacherous Life: The Graham Henry Story that the gang of criminals led by Smith committed crimes worth A$25 million in the 1980s. Early life Smith was born to an Australian mother and an American serviceman father whom he never knew, and he was brought up in Sydney. He attended boys' homes for roughly three years after becoming involved in burglaries and other offences. Criminal career Smith has spent much of the rest of his life in prison, serving sentences in 1963 to 1965, 1968 to 1975, 1978 to 1980, and 1989 to now.Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith Smith was a self-confessed heroin dealer, and armed robber, who gained notoriety for his violent temper. Standing tall and weighing in his prime, Smith exploited his size when involved in countless street fights and bar brawls. Journalist John Dale has commented that \\"there is no doubting Neddy Smith's physical size and menacing aura\\".\\"Visiting Ned in Long Bay\\" at newmatilda.com . Retrieved on 18 January 2008. In Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith, he claimed to have beaten up former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Bunny Johnson after a row outside a Sydney nightclub. However, he denies committing the rape for which he was imprisoned in 1968 and the numerous murders of which he has been accused. Smith gained further notoriety when he became a whistleblower and star witness for the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Wood Royal Commission. He obtained immunity for all crimes he had committed, except murder in exchange for testifying against former New South Wales Police detective Roger Rogerson and other allegedly-corrupt police officers. During ICAC proceedings, Smith testified that he had committed eight armed robberies and had made a large amount of money from dealing heroin. He alleged that members of New South Wales Police had given him a \\"green light\\" to commit crimes and had aided him in various robberies and other crimes. He also claimed to have paid corrupt police officers large sums of money to escape criminal charges himself and to assist his friends in avoiding criminal charges. In The Damage Done, Warren Fellows claimed he had witnessed Smith make death threats against two police officers, who attempted to take him in for questioning on his daughter's tenth birthday. Fellows also alleges that he was working for Smith when he was arrested in Thailand for attempting to smuggle of heroin back to Australia. Fellows was travelling in the company of Smith's brother-in-law, Paul Hayward, who was also charged with trafficking. Though Smith has been charged with eight murders, he was convicted only of the murder of brothel owner Harvey Jones and the murder-in-company of a tow-truck driver named Ronnie Flavell during an incident of road rage on 30 October 1987.Sun Herald (Sydney) article, page 2 \\"Neddy Smith\\" On Murder Charge.

The West Australian, 30 August 2017. Retrieved 7 September 2017 Popular culture =Blue Murder TV miniseries= Smith's claimed exploits and those of allegedly-corrupt New South Wales police officers are depicted in the miniseries Blue Murder, based on Smith's book, Neddy, and produced by Australia's public broadcaster, ABC TV. First aired in most of Australia in 1995, the show was banned in New South Wales until 2001 because of the ICAC hearings, the Wood Royal Commission and outstanding contempt of court charges. Australian actor Tony Martin played Smith, and Richard Roxburgh played Rogerson. In Blue Murder, Smith is shown murdering whistleblower prostitute Sallie-Anne Huckstepp. Smith was recorded in his prison cell confessing to that crime and later made the same confession to his publisher. However, he has otherwise consistently denied involvement in the murder and has maintained that he knew that he was being secretly recorded in his cell and made the statement to gain publicity for his book. He was subsequently charged with Huckstepp's murder but was acquitted. In his second book, Catch and Kill Your Own, Smith implies ignorance but told writer John Dale that he knows who committed her murder and would release the information once the killer is dead. Later life Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1981, Smith served 14 years in Long Bay Correctional Centre, New South Wales, and was a regular patient at the prison hospital. In 2003, he was moved to Lithgow Correctional Centre. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph reported that his Parkinson's medication had ceased being effective and that Smith's health had deteriorated, leaving him unable to maintain balance and using a wheelchair. Smith continues to refuse to assist police with ongoing investigations of unsolved murders, which were not covered by the immunity granted to him in exchange for his testimony against allegedly-corrupt police officers at the ICAC and the Wood Royal Commission hearings. In April 2017, Smith attempted to escape custody while being treated for heart problems at the Prince of Wales Hospital, in Randwick, New South Wales He allegedly sneaked past two prison guards, only to be caught by nurses in the corridor.

According to the , it has a population of people. Residents of the town of Barugo are traditionally referred to as Barugonon but often incorrectly referred to as Barugue√±os. Barugo is a town in the northern coastal part of Leyte facing Carigara Bay, north-west of Tacloban City, whose history dates back to the early days of Spanish colonization. It remains an agricultural town producing rice, corn and copra. Residents of a few coastal barangays are engaged in small-scale fishing and aquaculture. Its cottage industries are the manufacture of tuba (coconut palm wine) and roscas (sweet pastries made of flour, sugar, eggs and shortening). Not unlike the rest of the country, its economy is partly driven by dollar remittances from overseas workers. Geography =Barangays= Barugo is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. =Climate= History Early during the Spanish rule, the area was given the status of a pueblo (town) when it was established as an \\"encomienda.\\" An encomienda was a land estate awarded to deserving Spaniards for services rendered to the Spanish Crown. The grantee of an encomienda, known as encomiendero, was given the right to rule the encomienda in accordance with the Spanish laws and to extract tributes from the natives, part of which went to the Spanish Crown. Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, the first governor of the Islas Pilipinas, started the practice of designating large landed estates as encomiendas. Only ten months after Cebu and Manila became encomiendas, Barugo was also designated as one on November 3, 1571. Rodrigo de Vargas was the first encomiendero for Barugo. The education of the natives in Leyte started with the arrival of the Jesuits on July 16, 1595. The mission schools in the beginning concentrated on the basics of Christianity. Barugo initially was only a \\"visita\\" of Carigara, meaning that it was under the administrative and spiritual supervision of the curate of Carigara, and was under the care of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, who eventually became its first parish priest after Barugo was declared as an independent parish. It was Fr. Sanchez who established the first church in Barugo. The Jesuits stayed in Leyte from 1595 to 1767. During that time they expanded their influence starting from Carigara and Barugo, in the hinterlands of Ogmuc (Ormoc), Dulac (Dulag), Palo, Alangalang, Malibago (?) and the entire island of Cibabaw (Samar). When Charles III of Spain ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits from all Spanish dominions in 1767, the Jesuit mission on Leyte was handed over to the Augustinians. And later in 1843, the same missions were taken over by the Franciscan Friars. Fray Timoteo Calderon was the first Franciscan curate assigned to Barugo. At that time in 1843, Barugo already had 1,744 taxpayers and 8,381 residents. The towns of Alangalang, Jaro, Babatngon, Malibago (?) and San Miguel were once only \\"visitas\\" of Barugo. In Barugo there is a legend which was being taught to elementary pupils during the 1950s and 1960s regarding how the town got its name. The legend goes like this: \\"Once upon a time there was a man named Cassadok. One day while he was resting by the river bank under the shade of a giant tree, a Spaniard came along and asked him the name of the place. Cassadok did not understand Spanish and thinking the Spaniard was asking the name of the big shady tree, answered \\"Balugo.\\" From that time on, the place came to be known as \\"Balugo.\\" When the Americans came, they changed the letter \\"L\\" to \\"R\\" and thus to this day the town is called Barugo.\\" This story has no basis in fact and is simply a legend. For the early Spanish historians and chroniclers have always referred to the town by the name it carries today, Barugo. Today Barugo nestles along the coast of Carigara Bay. But the original settlement of Barugo was way upstream by the banks of the Himanglos River, which during the time of the conquistadores was called Barugo River. It is highly probable that the first Barugo settlement was in the place which is now known as Nasunogan, meaning a place burned down. This assumption is born by the fact that the old Spanish road leading to the towns of Tunga and Jaro starts at this place and the ruins of an old Spanish stone church is found there. This assumption is also corroborated, firstly, by the writings of Fr. Chirino wherein he described their travels by foot to Barugo and of a settlement by \\"la orilla,\\" meaning by the bank of a river and by the mouth of the river. Secondly, the story of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, regarding their attempt to reach a seriously sick man, tells of their travel from the town of Barugo by \\"a small boat in which we sailed to seek our sick man, who was living in horon, far from the town and near the coast.\\" From Nasunogan, after the old settlement was burned, the people moved to another place which is now called Binongto-an, meaning a place abandoned as a town, now a sitio of Barangay Pikas. The settlers did not stay there long and moved eventually to the present site of the town. This conclusion stems from the fact that lasting structures can be found in Binongto-an.

It was one of the species of Cypseloides controversially moved to Streptoprocne by the AOU (BLI 2004). Description This swift is a medium-sized species, 12.7-13.5 cm long, with a longish tail, and weighing 20 g. The male is blackish with a rufous collar. In females and immatures the rufous collar is incomplete or absent. Young birds also differ from the females in that they have reddish edges to the crown feathers. The Chestnut-collared Swift has a chattering chit-chit-chit call. Behaviour =Breeding= The chestnut-collared swift builds a nest of mud and plant material on a vertical surface in a damp shady location near water, such as in a cave, under a bridge, or in a culvert. The nest is shaped like a flattened cone, and the two white eggs are incubated by both sexes for 23 days, with a further 40 days to fledging. The young are fed on foodballs made from the collected prey. =Feeding= Chestnut-collared swifts feed in flight on flying insects, especially flying ants, often at a greater height than other swifts. Although breeding occurs at all levels where there are suitable sites, this species usually feeds over hill forests or more open woodland at 500 m or more.

He is a session and road-tour percussionist, and occasional actor, who has worked with several musically diverse bands and artists including George Harrison, Billy Joel, Rick Wakeman, Eric Clapton, Pink Floyd and Elton John. Cooper absorbed the influence of rock drummers from the 1960s and 1970s such as Ginger Baker, Carmine Appice and John Bonham. Incorporation of unusual instruments (for rock drummers of the time) such as cowbells, glockenspiel and tubular bells, along with several standard kit elements, helped create a highly varied setup. Continually modified to this day, Cooper's percussion set offers a large array of percussion instruments for sonic diversity such as the tambourine, congas, crash cymbals, cowbells, rototoms, tubular bells, the gong, snare drum and timpani. Life and career Cooper was born in Watford, Hertfordshire. In addition to percussion, Cooper studied classical piano, strings and woodwind, as well as theatre. He later joined the band Blue Mink, and as a session musician he played on records for artists such as America, Carly Simon and David Essex. He played on and co-produced the album Somewhere in England by former Beatle George Harrison in 1981 (Dark Horse Records DHK 3492). Cooper has long been associated with Elton John's career, playing on more than 90 recordings, and performing in more than 800 concerts with John both as a duo and in various band configurations. His first appearance with John was during the sessions for Madman Across the Water, and he played his first live show with him in early 1972. Cooper had a short stint with The Rolling Stones playing percussion for their 1974 It's Only Rock 'n Roll album. After contributing to various Elton John albums, Cooper joined the Elton John Band full-time in 1974 and spent the next two years recording and touring with the group. During John's semi-retirement in the late 1970s, Cooper played on various singles and albums for John, and recorded with George Harrison, the Kinks, Wings and Art Garfunkel. In 1977 and again in 1979, Cooper toured with Elton John as a duo in which John would play a solo set and then be joined by Cooper on percussion for the second half of the concerts. Cooper's relationship with the Rolling Stones continued into the 1980s. In 1981, he contributed to Bill Wyman's third solo album. In 1983, he participated in a short tour for the Ronnie Lane ARMS Charity Concert along with Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck and other artists, including Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts. In the 1980s, Cooper continued to record and tour periodically with Elton John. In 1986, he joined John's touring band for the Tour De Force (tour) concerts in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, augmenting Jody Linscott, who was the band's percussionist on the rest of John's world tour. Cooper showed up on Christine McVie's self-titled solo album in 1984. In 1985, Cooper appeared on both Mick Jagger's She's the Boss album and Bill Wyman's Willie & The Poor Boys. Also in 1985, Cooper performed as percussionist for a number of artists during the charity event Live Aid. In 1997, he guested with Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings for Struttin' Our Stuff. In every tour during 1990, Eric Clapton and the band played \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", which then flowed into a short one-minute drum solo by Steve Ferrone (drummer for Clapton's band on the tour), then into a 7-minute percussion solo by Ray Cooper on the tambourine, congas, and gong. During 1994 and 1995 Face to Face tours with Billy Joel, and during Elton John's tours in 1995, Elton John played \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\", which then flowed into a solo by Cooper on percussion. In the 1995 \\"Evening With Elton John and Ray Cooper\\" tour, the two men performed in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Costa Rica, where John performed a solo set, then was joined by Cooper on percussion for the second half of the show. On 15 September 1997, Cooper was the principal percussionist along with Phil Collins at the Music for Montserrat fund raiser concert in Royal Albert Hall. Cooper was part of the band at the Concert for George, the memorial concert for George Harrison, held at the Royal Albert Hall in 2002. He contributed to the tribute concert for Jim Capaldi in January 2007. He worked on Katie Melua's album Pictures (2007).  Film work  Towards the end of the 1980s, Cooper got involved in film as a musician, actor and producer, including movies for HandMade Films, which was owned by his friend George Harrison. He has played small roles such as the preacher in Robert Altman's feature film Popeye (1980) starring Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall. He has performed music in several of Terry Gilliam's productions, appearing on-screen in quirky roles like the technician who swats the beetle at the beginning of Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil and as the functionary whispering in the ear of Jonathan Pryce's Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson character in 1989's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. He appeared in the Concert for Cascara in the 1985 film Water, and appears as a street commercial for The Zero Theorem. The role of Albert Arthur Moxey in the hit television series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet was written with Cooper in mind by friends Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, with the character originally being conceived as an Irishman, after Cooper expressed an interest in acting. The role was however given to Christopher Fairbank, who opted to play him as a scouser, due to Cooper being unable to make it to the audition and commit to the show. The character of Moxey was given only limited lines and screentime in the first series of \\"Pet\\" due to Cooper's acting inexperience. Recent work Cooper has continued recording and performing with Elton John on various albums and tours, including John's The Million Dollar Piano show in Las Vegas. In 2009, John and Cooper performed a small exclusive series of shows, mostly in the UK and Europe, the first time since 1995 that the two had toured together without a band. Amongst their performances was one at the Royal Albert Hall to raise funds for a new organ which the Royal Academy of Music would assemble in their Duke's Hall. They raised further funds with a further performance at the Royal Opera House in 2011. The organ has been named the Sir Elton John and Ray Cooper Organ, and was heard for the first time on 7 October 2013. In a greeting to Cooper on his 70th birthday, John's website stated that when Elton composed the song \\"Tambourine\\" for his 2016 Wonderful Crazy Night album, he made sure to bring in Cooper to play the instrument on the track. As of June 2019, Cooper is touring with John as part of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road farewell tour. Instruments played Cooper is known to have played tambourine, congas, maracas, bongos, cymbals, wind chimes, bell tree, triangle, timpani, bells, tubular bells, shaker, vibraphone, marimba, gong, Rototoms, jaw bone, cowbell, finger cymbals, timbales, crotales, g√ºiro, glockenspiel, whistle, drum kit, snare drum, keyboards, piano, and guitar.

It is also the name of the 20th day of the tzolk ºin, the Maya divinatory calendar, on which a ruler's k ºatun-ending rituals would fall. Logogram for the 20th named-day of the Tzolkin Maya calendar cycle, Ajaw (this version is typical of many monumental inscriptions) Background The word is known from several Mayan languages both those in pre-Columbian use (such as in Classic Maya), as well as in their contemporary descendant languages (in which there may be observed some slight variations). \\"Ajaw\\" is the modernised orthography in the standard revision of Mayan orthography, put forward in 1994 by the Guatemalan Academia de Lenguas Mayas, and now widely adopted by Mayanist scholars. Before this standardisation, it was more commonly written as \\"Ahau\\", following the orthography of 16th-century Yucatec Maya in Spanish transcriptions (now Yukatek in the modernised style). In the Maya hieroglyphics writing system, the representation of the word ajaw could be as either a logogram, or spelled-out syllabically. In either case, quite a few glyphic variants are known. Not surprisingly, a picture of the ruler sometimes substitutes for the more abstract day sign. Meaning Ajaw denoted any of the leading class of nobles in a particular polity. It was not limited to a single individual, with a meaning variously rendered as \\"leader\\", \\"ruler\\", \\"lord\\", \\"king\\", or \\"queen\\", depending on the individual. Since the ajaw performed religious activities, it also designated a member of the Maya priesthood. The variant k ºuhul ajaw (\\"divine lord\\") indicates a sovereign leader of a polity, although the extent of the territory and influence controlled by an ajaw varied considerably, and k ºuhul ajaw could also be applied to persons who, in theory, recognised the overlordship of another person, dynasty, or state. When the title was given to women rulers, such as K'awiil Ajaw (640-681 AD) of Coba, the term was sometimes prefixed with the sign Ix (\\"woman\\") to indicate their gender. Earliest evidence The archaeological site of K ºo, associated with the Classic Maya city of Holmul located in modern-day Guatemala, boasts what may be the royal tomb of the earliest known Mayan ruler. This tomb has been dated to 350-300 BC. It contains the earliest evidence of the institution of ajaw in the Maya Lowlands.John Tomasic and Steven Bozarth (2011), New Data from a Preclassic Tomb at K ºo, Guatemala.

The serial is set on the planet Manussa 500 years after the 1982 serial Kinda. In the serial, the Mara takes over the bodies of the Doctor's companion Tegan (Janet Fielding) and Lon (Martin Clunes), the ruler's son, while seeking to manifest itself by using a crystal. Plot The arrival of the TARDIS on Manussa, formerly homeworld of both the Manussan Empire and Sumaran Empire, triggers nightmares in Tegan, who dreams of a snake-shaped cave mouth. It is evident to the Fifth Doctor that the Mara is reasserting itself on her mind following her possession by the entity while on the Kinda planet of Deva Loka (Kinda). He attempts to calm her by taking her and Nyssa in search of the cave but Tegan is too scared to enter when they find it, and runs away. Alone and confused Tegan lapses under the control of the Mara once more, revelling in horror and destruction. The emblem of the snake returns to her arm. Manussa is in the grip of a festival of celebration of the banishment of the Mara from the civilisation five hundred years earlier. In the absence of the Federator, who rules over the three- planet Federation, his indolent son Lon is to have a major role in the celebration, supported by his mother the Lady Tanha and the archaeologist Ambril, who is an expert in the Sumaran period. Lon is intrigued with the notion that the Mara might one day return as prophesied, but Ambril is unconvinced and believes such talk is the product of cranks. When the Doctor tries to get Ambril to take the threat seriously he too is dismissed as a maverick, though the young deputy curator Chela is more sympathetic and gives the Doctor a small blue crystal called a Little Mind's Eye, which is used by the Snakedancers, a mystical cult, in their ceremonies to repel the Mara. The Doctor realises the small crystal and its large counterpart, the Great Mind's Eye, can be used as focal points for mental energy and can turn thought into matter. This, he determines, is how the Mara will transfer from Tegan's mind to corporeal existence. He realises that the Manussans must once have been a very advanced people who could use molecular engineering in a zero-gravity environment. They created the Great Mind's Eye without realising its full potential, and the crystal drew the fear, hatred, and evil from their minds, amplified it and fed it back to them. Thus the Mara was born into Manussa and the reign of the Sumaran Empire began. Meanwhile, Tegan makes contact with Lon and passes the snake mark of the Mara to him too. They visit the cave from Tegan's dream, which contains a wall pattern, which could accommodate the Great Mind's Eye. Lon is sent back to the Palace while she causes more havoc and takes control of a showman, Dugdale, who is used for her pleasure. Lon meanwhile covers his arm and goes about trying to persuade Ambril to use the real Great Mind's Eye in the ceremony, placing it in a position in a wall carving that will evidently enable the Mara to return as the Doctor predicted. To persuade him to comply, Ambril is shown a secret cave of Sumaran archaeological treasures and warned they will all be destroyed if he does not help him. The Doctor and Nyssa have meanwhile been aided by Chela, who shares with them the journal of Dojjen, a snakedancer who was Ambril's predecessor. All three venture to the Palace to persuade the authorities to do something about the situation, but soon see Lon is in the grip of the Mara and orchestrating a very dangerous situation. All three escape and the Doctor now uses the Little Mind's Eye to contact Dojjen, who lives in sandy dunes beyond the city. They venture there and the Doctor communes with Dojjen by opening his mind after being bitten by a poisonous snake. He is told by the wise old snakedancer that the Mara may only be defeated by finding a still point in the mind. All three head back to the city to prevent the ceremony of defeating the Mara using the real Great Mind's Eye. The festivities are now at a peak, with a procession taking place which culminates in a ceremony at the cave. Lon plays the role of his ancestor Federator in rejecting the Mara. After a series of verbal challenges he seizes the real Great Mind's Eye and places it in the appropriate place on the wall. Tegan and Dugdale arrive and she displays the Mara mark on her arm, which is now becoming flesh having fed on the fear in Dugdale's mind. With the crystal in place, the Mara is able to create itself in the cave, becoming a vast and deadly snake. However, the Doctor arrives in time and refuses to look at the snake or recognise its evil, relying instead on the still place he finds through mental commune with Dojjen via the Little Mind's Eye. This resistance interrupts the manifestation of the Mara and its three slaves are freed while the snake itself dies and rots. The Doctor comforts a distraught Tegan, sure that the Mara has at last been destroyed. Production The success of Kinda and this story prompted Script Editor Eric Saward to commission Bailey to write a third and final story to feature the Mara: May Time. However, the story was abandoned due to production problems. In post-production, episode four of this story overran very badly. As a result, it had to be completely restructured. Originally the door for a third Mara adventure was to be left open, with closing scenes discussing the ultimate fate of the Great Crystal. Furthermore, a sequence in which the Doctor comforts Tegan had to be removed. The scene was reincorporated into the beginning of the subsequent serial, Mawdryn Undead (1983). =Cast notes= Brian Miller was the husband of Elisabeth Sladen who portrayed long-time companion Sarah Jane Smith. He later appeared in \\"Deep Breath\\" in Series 8 (2014), as well as playing Harry Sowersby in The Mad Woman in the Attic (2009), a story of The Sarah Jane Adventures, and providing Dalek voices for both Resurrection of the Daleks (1984) and Remembrance of the Daleks (1988).

Ittinuar (Inuktitut: ·ê≤·ëé·ïê ·êÉ·ë¶·ëé·ìÑ·êä·ïê; born January 19, 1950) is a Canadian politician. He was the first Inuk in Canada to be elected as an MP, and represented the electoral district of Nunatsiaq in the House of Commons of Canada from 1979 to 1984. Biography =Early life= Ittinuar, the grandson of Danish explorer, Peter Freuchen,Ittinuar, Peter Freuchen. The Canadian Encyclopedia was born in Chesterfield Inlet, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut). He spent part of his youth and adolescence being educated in Ottawa, Ontario, with two childhood friends, Zebedee Nungak and Eric Tagoona. All three later were important figures in advocating for the rights of the Inuit. Unbeknownst to them, they had been relocated to Ottawa by federal government authorities, as part of an experiment in cultural assimilation. These actions and their consequences form the subject of the documentary The Experimental Eskimos (2009).See, for example, Experimental Eskimo: A Critical Look at the Past; www.yorktonfilmfestival.com =Political career= Ittinuar was originally elected as a member of the New Democratic Party, but on November 26, 1982, he crossed the floor to sit with the Liberal caucus shortly after Indian Affairs and Northern Development minister John Munro announced plans to improve Inuit self-government by dividing the Northwest Territories into two (see Nunavut). In 1984 Ittinuar was charged with breach of trust, theft and forgery for allegedly using his parliamentary budget to purchase a boat motor. As a result of the court case he was suspended from the Liberal Party caucus, and he became an independent for the final few months of his term in office. Ittinuar ran for re-election in the 1984 federal election, but was defeated by the Progressive Conservative candidate Thomas Suluk. Ittinuar was later found not guilty on the 1984 breach of trust, theft and forgery charges. However, Ittinuar had earlier, in 1979, been convicted of possession of a small amount of cocaine. In addition, in 1986, he was convicted of assaulting his then wife, Susan Munro, daughter of former Liberal Cabinet Minister John Munro, and was fined. In 1993, Ittinuar again sought the NDP nomination in Nunatsiaq, but was unable to do so, due to then NDP leader Audrey McLaughlin refusing to endorse his candidacy. In 2008, while living in southern Ontario, Ittinuar ran unsuccessfully for the Green Party in the Nunavut riding in the federal election.

These plants are known commonly as skunk cabbage or less often as swamp lantern. The spelling Lysichitum is also found. The genus has two species, one found in north-east Asia (Japan and Russian Far East), the other in north-west America (Aleutians to Santa Cruz County in California).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesBiota of North America Program county distribution map Description Lysichiton has flowers which are typical of those of the family to which it belongs (the arum family or Araceae). The individual flowers are small and are tightly packed on a fleshy stem called a spadix which is surrounded by a white or yellow but otherwise leaf-like bract called a spathe. The spathe is hooded or boat-shaped at the top. Lysichiton has flowers with both male and female parts present (bisexual), unlike many other aroids. After fertilization, the green fruits become embedded in the spadix; each fruit usually has two seeds but may have up to four. Several large leaves appear either just before flowering or soon afterwards; each has a short stalk (petiole). Plants die down to a vertical rhizome in winter., in Taxonomy The genus Lysichiton was described by Heinrich Schott in 1857. The name is derived from two Greek words: (lysis, dissolve) and (chiton, armour), referring to the armour-like spathe enclosing the inflorescence that withers soon after flowering. Schott used two variants of this name in his original publication: one with a Latinized ending, Lysichitum, and the other with a Greek ending, Lysichiton. In two later publications he used only the second variant. Only one species was assigned to the genus, Lysichiton camtschatcensis. In a paper published in 1932, Eric Hult√©n and Harold St. John separated American plants into a second species. They decided that Schott's Lysichitum was correct under the rules of botanical nomenclature; accordingly older sources use this spelling as the generic name for both species. In 1956 they revised their view and decided that the correct generic name was the one which was adopted latest by Schott, namely Lysichiton. This is the spelling now used., search for \\"Lysichiton\\" Along with other members of the subfamily Orontioideae, Lysichiton has been placed in a group of \\"proto-aroids\\", which appear to have evolved before the characteristic features of most aroids emerged. Thus the genus has flowers which retain small petals and which are bisexual, whereas more \\"advanced\\" aroids have unisexual flowers without petals. =Species= This genus includes two species and the hybrid between them which occurred in cultivation: *Lysichiton americanus Hult√©n & H.St.John \\\\- Western skunk cabbage, Western North America *Lysichiton camtschatcensis (L.) Schott \\\\- Asian skunk cabbage, Northeastern Asia *Lysichiton √ó hortensis J.D.Arm. & B.W.Phillips ‚Äì Hybrid swamp lantern These two species were originally considered conspecific, under the earlier-described name L. camtschatcensis. The most obvious difference between them lies in the spathe, which is yellow with a green-suffused apex in L. americanus and white with at most a small amount of green at the apex in L. camtscatcensis. There are also differences in the leaves. At flowering time these are almost undeveloped in L. camtschatcensis, but about half grown in L. americanus. Lysichiton americanus has broader leaves, rounded at the base, with glossy upper surfaces, whereas L. camtschatcensis has less broad leaves, more pointed at the base, with dull, somewhat grey-green (glaucuous) upper surfaces. Uses Both species, but particularly L. americanus, have been used as ornamental garden plants. L. americanus was introduced into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1901 and has escaped to become naturalized in marshy areas in Britain and Ireland. The hybrid between the two species occurred in cultivation, and is larger than either parent, with a less unpleasant scent. Lysichiton americanus was used by indigenous people in various ways.

He represented the electoral district of Nunatsiaq in the House of Commons of Canada from 1984 to 1988 as a member of the Progressive Conservatives.  Biography  Thomas Suluk was born on March 14, 1950 in Arviat,Parliament of Canada then part of the Northwest Territories. After graduating from Arthur Turner Anglican Theological School in Pangnirtung, on Baffin Island, Suluk was posted to Apex, Iqaluit. However, at age 22, he was one year too young to go through the process of ordination. Instead of waiting, Suluk chose to enter politics, during a time when Inuit were beginning to learn of land claims and their civil rights. He began in his local council office, but moved on to working for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, as he had an interest in broader community issues. After working as a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio announcer for a short period, Suluk won an election to the House of Commons of Canada at the 1984 federal election, representing the electoral district of Nunatsiaq (now Nunavut). His election was close - his Progressive Conservative candidacy narrowly defeated the Liberal candidate, Robert Kuptana, by just 247 votes. During his time in Parliament, Suluk focused on land claims issues in Nunavut, and was also involved with the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut (now Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated), which was at the time the peak organisation tasked with negotiating land claims and treaties for Inuit. Suluk did not contest the seat at the following election. After his brief role in politics, Suluk opened a coffeeshop in Arviat, and as of 2008 was working on the 2007/8 Inuit Health Survey.

The area is bounded by Nottingham city centre to the west, Bakersfield to the north, Colwick to the east, and the River Trent to the south. Sneinton now lies within the unitary authority of Nottingham, having been part of Nottinghamshire until 1877. Sneinton has existed as a village since at least 1086, but remained relatively unchanged up until the industrial era, when the population dramatically expanded. Further social change in the post-war period left Sneinton with a multicultural character. Sneinton residents of note include William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, and mathematician George Green, who worked Green's Mill at the top of Belvoir Hill.  History  Nottingham and Sneinton, as they stood in 1831 The history of Sneinton is inextricably tied to that of its near neighbour, the City of Nottingham. When the area that is now Nottingham was settled by the Anglo- Saxon chieftain \\"Snot\\", he named the settlement \\"Snottingham\\" (the homestead of Snot's people, where inga = the people of; ham = homestead), and the area east of the city, also settled by Saxons, was called \\"Snottington\\" (the suffix ton = farmstead settlement). Sneinton is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where is referred to as \\"Notintone\\", which represents the Norman pronunciation of an Anglo-Saxon placename, with the \\"Sn\\" dropped in favour of \\"N\\", which was easier to say in the Norman language. The Norman pronunciation of \\"Nottingham\\" stuck, whereas their pronunciation of \\"Notintone\\" did not. In the years between 1086 and 1599, \\"Sneinton\\" became the agreed way of spelling the village name. = Industrial era = Until the 19th century Sneinton was no more than a village, standing on a high ridge about a mile east of Nottingham town centre overlooking the valley of the River Trent. The village was to change dramatically when the principal landowner of the time, the First Earl Manvers, sold off the land between Nottingham and Sneinton to developers. Housing was built on the land in which Nottingham's factory workers lived. Building regulations at that time where somewhat lax, and so the new landscape was to become a slum. Poverty and poor sanitation were facts of life for those living in these cramped tenements. Green's Mill, a red brick tower mill, was built around 1807 on the site of a previous smaller post mill. When the founder of the mill died, his son, renowned mathematician George Green, inherited and operated it until his death in 1841. Near Green's Mill stood the imposing Nottingham Lunatic Asylum, the first County Asylum to open in England, which existed from 1812 to 1902. It was later converted into a boarding school named King Edward's, governed by the infamous head master Alfred Tanner and his wife Mary. Children were killed in industrial accidents at the school. It has since been demolished and is now the location of King Edward Park. At the end of the Nineteenth century, the Third Earl Manvers sold off the remainder of the Pierrepont family land to developers, who subsequently build all of the Victorian housing on the slopes of Sneinton Dale. This housing was of a higher standard than the previous development, and still stands to this day. The population then grew to a peak of 23,093 in 1901, as lace and textile manufacturing expanded along with heavy industry. = Modern period = In the 1930s, Nottingham began to address the problem of overcrowding. Many people in Sneinton at the time were living in the older, cramped, unfit-for-purpose damp Victorian housing. These homes were generally rented, so it was a trivial process use clearance orders to evict tenants. Unfit houses were demolished, and the land redeveloped under the \\"Carter Gate\\" redevelopment. Further development was put on hold due to World War II, during which Sneinton was heavily bombed. A map produced by the local Civil Defence Departments showed that many of the industrial units on Meadow Lane received direct hits. Later in the 1950s came the \\"Chedworth Estate\\" redevelopment. A large amount of modern housing was built during this period, as well as five multi-story tower blocks, all of which stand to the present day. Around this time, economic migrants began to settle in Sneinton, drawn by affordable housing near to places of work. In the 21st century, Sneinton has retained a sense of community, giving it a village-like feel, which has so far resisted gentrification. As of 2014, Sneinton has the 11th lowest crime rate out of the 25 Nottingham districts, beating all other comparable inner city areas (such as St Ann's, the Meadows, and Radford). House prices have risen over the past few decades but housing remains cheaper in Sneinton than in other Nottingham suburbs. This may change when the planned \\"Eastside\\" urban renewal projects beside Sneinton are completed. Governance Boundaries of Sneinton Sneinton was officially incorporated into the borough of Nottingham in 1877. It now lies within the unitary authority of Nottingham, and so is governed by Nottingham City Council. Nottingham has been sending MPs to Westminster since 1295; the constituency was split up in 1885 and Sneinton has been part of Nottingham East ever since. Within the Nottingham East constituency, Sneinton mostly lies within the Dales electoral ward, though the Sneinton Elements estate is included in the St. Anns ward instead.  Geography  Colwick Woods from the hilltop, looking south-west Sneinton is the area around Sneinton Dale road, which runs for about two miles east of Nottingham city centre until it turns into Oakdale at a roundabout marking the boundary with the 1930s suburb of Bakersfield to the east. Otherwise the boundaries are blurred - Carlton Road and the A612 Newark road are generally regarded as the northern and southern boundaries of the residential area, but the Dales electoral ward, which includes Sneinton and Bakersfield, extends south of the Newark road down to the river. Thus the ward includes riverside industrial areas, the racecourse, Colwick Woods and Colwick Country Park as they are within the city boundary and Colwick is outside it in Gedling borough. The ward boundary mostly runs south of Carlton Road but some estate agents may describe property north of it around Victoria Park as being in Sneinton rather than the troubled area of St Ann's. The western boundary of the ward comes up from Lady Bay Bridge along the A6011 Meadow Lane which turns into the A612 Manvers Road. Sneinton sits on soft Bunter sandstone (of the Sherwood Sandstone Group type), overlaid on top of Keuper marls (of the Mercia Mudstone Group). Nottinghamshire's sandstone ridges can easily be dug with simple hand tools to create artificial cave dwellings. The general area around what is now Nottingham was once known in the Brythonic language as \\"Tigguo Cobauc\\" meaning \\"The Place of Caves\\" and was referred to as such by the Bishop of Sherborne Asser in 893 AD in The Life of King Alfred. Cave dwellings extended out into Sneinton, wherein they were referred to as the \\"Hermitage\\", being as they were occupied by members of a reclusive religious order. When Manvers Road was first constructed, brick buildings were built facing into the sandstone, using the caves as back rooms. In 1829 a rock collapse destroyed these buildings, and in 1897 a railway expansion forced Manvers Road to divert, cutting away much of the rockface, erasing most of Sneinton's remaining caves. What little remains can still be seen along the edge of Sneinton Hermitage.  Demography  In 1801 the population of Sneinton stood at just 558. By 1851, Sneinton's population had grown to 8,440. The population peaked at 23,093 in 1901. People from the West Indies, Southern Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, The Middle East, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, Africa, South America and North America are all represented in Sneinton, but the greatest single population comes from Pakistan. As result of this mixed migrant population, the area has a multicultural character, and has a diverse range of restaurants and stores. In 2011, the population stood at 12,689 people, of which 60% was white, 20% Asian, 8% black, 9% mixed, 2% other.  Economy  In the 19th century the local industries were lace and textile manufacturing, like most of Nottingham. In Sneinton, heavier industries were also represented, such as the iron foundry, engineering works, and brickworks, sited at the eastern end of Sneinton Dale. Most of the existing red brick terraced houses were built in the nineteenth century, and many of the factories and warehouses of that era have long since been demolished to make way for additional housing. Sneinton has a traditional open-air public market situated at the north-western end of Sneinton, where the district meets the city centre. Though the Market has struggled in recent years due to its relative isolation amongst surrounding derelict buildings, Sneinton Dale and Sneinton Boulevard, the two main high streets through the village, have weathered the recession and are thriving. The Sneinton Business Forum represents over 160 local businesses. There are major plans to dramatically renovate Sneinton Market and the entire area that forms a buffer zone between Sneinton and the Nottingham city centre. This urban regeneration project has been called \\"Nottingham Eastside\\" by developers, but the start date has been pushed back numerous times, due to a lack of funding amidst the Great Recession. The Eastside development ties in with Nottingham City Council's ambitions to develop the south eastern part of the city centre into a \\"Creative Quarter\\". The area includes the Lace Market, Hockley, Broadmarsh East, the Eastside Island site and BioCity, the project aims at creating growth and jobs. In July 2012, the government contributed ¬£25 million towards a ¬£45 million venture capital fund, mainly targeted at the Creative Quarter.  Culture  A live band plays in the Hermitage Square in 2007 The art gallery Trade is one of a number of projects at One Thoresby St, listed as one of \\"the world's best secret art galleries\\" by Alexander Farquharson of Nottingham Contemporary. Sneinton Dale was previously the site of an art deco film house called Dale Cinema, which operated from 1932 to 1957. There are around a dozen public houses in Sneinton, the oldest of which is The Lord Nelson, sited in a 500-year-old building which was originally a coaching inn called The Hornbuckles. The studios of regional radio station Gem 106 are nearby on the City Link. = Festival = Every July, Sneinton holds a festival organised around a different theme. The first festival was held in 1995, and is run by a volunteer group made up of local residents, representatives of local organisations, community groups, schools, church, youth and play groups, artists, musicians, performers and local project workers. Since 2002, the group has been supported and coordinated by the Sneinton Community Project. The Sneinton Festival has three elements: initial workshops, a week-long festival, and the final carnival. Workshops organised by The Festival Group take place in the run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to be creative around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of arts-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a parade held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment.  Sites of interest  Green's Mill was built in Sneinton in 1807, damaged by fire in 1947, and restored in the 1980s as a tourist attraction There are several parks and allotments within Sneinton, such as Belvoir Park and the Dale Allotments, but by far the largest green space is Colwick Woods. Colwick Woods lies to the east of Sneinton, and, at 50 hectares or 123 acres, is almost as large as Sneinton itself. It is a mixture of grassland and ancient woodland, and forms a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The ancient woodland is a habitat for indicator species such as dogs mercury and ramsons. The site is rich in mammal species including both species of pipistrelle and noctule bat. Public rights of way are marked out across the site, along with desire paths that run throughout the woods. The woods and meadows, unusually close to a city centre, are very popular with local people for outdoor activities including walking, mountain biking, and other activities. Steep hills are a characteristic feature of most of the site, and wheelchair access is only from Greenwood Road into the open grassland. Greenwood Dale High School shares a boundary with the reserve and educational events have been held in partnership with the school including photographic scavenger hunts and sapling collection. Open days are held in the summer allowing the public to be actively involved with the reserve. Colwick Woods has an active Friends Group who meet regularly to discuss the condition of the site and carry out wildlife conservation activities in the woods. Green's Mill is a restored and working 19th century tower windmill, located at the top of Belvoir Hill, overlooking the city of Nottingham. Built in the early 1800s for the milling of wheat into flour, it remained in use until the 1860s. It was renovated in the 1980s and is now part of a science centre, which together have become a local tourist attraction. The Sneinton Dragon The Sneinton Dragon is a large sculpture that stands at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from stainless steel, it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what they would like to see as a piece of public art to represent their area. It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the Christmas period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There are also three other sculptures in Sneinton. Transport The main High Street through the village is Sneinton Dale. Many of the residential streets in Sneinton are named after battles and generals of the Second Boer War. Sneinton is bounded to the north by the B686 (Carlton Road), and to the west and south by the A612 road (Manvers Street and Colwick Loop Road) which runs from Nottingham to Newark-on-Trent. The railway to Netherfield and Grantham runs through Sneinton but it has not had a station since the Racecourse station shut in 1959. The Nottingham Suburban Railway connected Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with Daybrook, but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1954. Tramlines once ran down Carlton Road. Buses * 43: Nottingham - Sneinton Dale - Bakersfield * 44: Nottingham - Sneinton - Colwick - Netherfield - Gedling  Education  Sneinton has six primary school providers, William Booth Primary School, Edale Rise Primary and Nursery School, Sneinton St Stephen's CofE Primary School, Windmill L.E.A.D. Academy, the Iona School, and The Nottingham Academy (operating from the former Jesse Boot Primary School). Nottingham Academy also runs the only secondary school in the area, on the sites of the former Greenwood Dale and Elliot Durham Schools. Sneinton has a public library, which can be found on Sneinton Dale (at the former Sneinton Police Station site).  Religion  St. Stephen's Church, the parish church of Sneinton The religious life of Sneinton reflects the diversity of its inhabitants. The main religious denomination has traditionally been the Church of England, which is represented by four churches: St. Christopher's, St. Cyprian's, St. Matthias' and St. Stephen's. St. Stephen's is the parish church at the centre of the parish of \\"St Stephen with St Matthias\\". Two former Church of England sites have been taken over by other denominations, namely St Alban's, which is now Catholic, and St. Luke's which is now the Congregation of Yahweh. The Albion Congregational Church also lies within Sneinton. St Mary's and St. George's is the local Coptic Christian place of worship, and Bethesda represents the Pentacostal faith. Beyond Christianity, there is also a Hindu Temple & Community Centre on Carlton Road, and the Jamia Masjid Sultania mosque was recently built on Sneinton Dale, giving the Muslim community a place to worship.  Sport  Sneinton Market Place and Victoria Leisure Centre. Gyms in the village include the award-winning Victoria Leisure Centre. Carlton Town F.C. is a local football team, that was founded as Sneinton F.C. in 1904. There are two local basketball teams; the men's team is the Beeston Tropics, and the women's is the Nottingham Wildcats.  Notable people  Sneinton was the birthplace of the mathematician George Green (born 1793) who lived in a house beside one of the village windmills, one of which he owned and ran. William Booth, the founder of The Salvation Army, was born in 1829 in the house which is now The William Booth Birthplace Museum, located on Notintone Place. Another famous son of Sneinton was the bare knuckle boxing champion, William Thompson, better known as Bendigo. A public house in the area still proudly bears a statue of the figure above its door, though it is now named The Hermitage. Lydia Beardsall, mother of D.H. Lawrence, came from Sneinton and married Arthur Lawrence in St Stephen's on 27 December 1875. A more recent Sneinton celebrity is the film director Shane Meadows who lived in Sneinton and filmed some of his early works partly in Sneinton, including Small Time in 1996.

The cars had an unusual seating arrangement, with a small child-sized seat behind the driver on the left and a conventional passenger seat diagonally behind and to the right. A. Felber & Co were a well known manufacturer of motorcycle sidecars, based in Vienna, Austria. The Autoroller was designed by Ernst Marold. From 1952 to 1953, about 400 units were built in two versions, all of which were painted light green using a standard paint then used for machinery which was cheaper than car paint. Early models had cycle-type mudguards that swivelled with the front wheels, later models had fixed wings. The owners had a very active club; The Austrian Autoroller Club, whose newsletter can be found in the Austrian National Library. In 1954, at the wedding of Mr. Marold, a remarkable corso of Felbers accompanied the wedding limousine in front of the Karlskirche in the Viennese City centre. After the liberalisation of car imports into Austria in 1954, car manufacture proved uncompetitive and the company began the manufacture of industrial washing machines instead. The company also moved into the sale and distribution of cars from Heinkel, Trojan, Spatz and Reliant. About twelve rolling chassis were delivered to specialist coachbuilding company Hofmann & Moldrich in Vienna who built upon them an egg shaped body out of 0.8mm aluminium plate called M√∂ve 101. The only known remaining car is in the car museum in Aspang in Lower-Austria. Two surviving Felbers are to be seen in the RRR scooter and microcar museum in Eggenburg, Austria. A third one is under restoration in Serbia near to the Hungarian border and one in Bavaria.

The doctrine of the White Lotus included a forecast of the imminent advent of the future Buddha, Maitreya.  Origins  The first signs of the White Lotus Society came during the late thirteenth century. Mongol rule over China during the Yuan dynasty prompted small yet popular demonstrations against its rule. The White Lotus Society took part in some of these protests as they grew into widespread dissent. The White Lotus originated as a hybrid movement of Buddhism and Manichaeism that emphasized strict vegetarianism; its permission for men and women to interact freely was considered socially shocking. Like other secret societies, they covered up their unusual or illicit activities as \\"incense-burning ceremonies\\". The Mongols considered the White Lotus society a heterodox religious sect and banned it, forcing its members to go underground. Now a secret society, the White Lotus became an instrument of quasi-national resistance and religious organization. This fear of secret societies carried on in the law; the Great Qing Legal Code, which was in effect until 1912, contained the following section:  White Lotus Revolution  The White Lotus was a fertile ground for fermenting rebellion. A Buddhist monk from Jiangxi named Peng Yingyu began to study the White Lotus and ended up organizing a rebellion in the 1330s. Although the rebellion was put down, Peng survived and hid in Anhui, then reappeared back in South China where he led another unsuccessful rebellion in which he was killed. This second rebellion changed its colors from white to red and its soldiers were known as the \\"Red Turbans\\" for their red bandanas. Another revolution inspired by the White Lotus society took shape in 1352 around Guangzhou. A Buddhist monk and former boy-beggar, the future Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang, joined the rebellion. His exceptional intelligence took him to the head of a rebel army; he won people to his side by forbidding his soldiers to pillage in observance of White Lotus religious beliefs. By 1355 the rebellion had spread through much of China. In 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang captured the important city of Nanjing (then called Jiqing) and made it his capital, renaming it Yingtian . It was here that he began to discard his heterodox beliefs and so won the help of Confucian scholars who issued pronouncements for him and performed rituals in his claim of the Mandate of Heaven, the first step toward establishing a new dynastic rule. Meanwhile, the Mongols were fighting among themselves, inhibiting their ability to suppress the rebellion. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang extended his rule to Guangzhou, the same year that the Mongol ruler, Toghon Tem√ºr, fled to Karakorum. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang and his army entered the former capital of Beijing and in 1371 his army moved through Sichuan to the southwest. By 1387, after more than thirty years of war, Zhu Yuanzhang had liberated all of China. He took the title Hongwu Emperor and founded the Ming dynasty, whose name echoes the religious sentiment of the White Lotus.  Later rebellions  A White Lotus uprising in 1622 was recorded in a Jonathan D. Spence book, The Death of Woman Wang. The White Lotus reemerged in the late 18th century in the form of an inspired Chinese movement in many different forms and sects. In 1774, the herbalist and martial artist Wang Lun founded a derivative sect of the White Lotus that promoted underground meditation teachings in Shandong province, not far from Beijing near the city of Linqing. The sect led an uprising that captured three small cities and laid siege to the larger city of Linqing, a strategic location on the north-south Grand Canal transportation route. After initial success, he was outnumbered and defeated by Qing troops, including local armies of Chinese soldiers known as the Green Standard Army. An account of Wang Lun's death was given to Qing authorities by a captured rebel. Wang Lun remained sitting in his headquarters wearing a purple robe and two silver bracelets while he burned to death with his dagger and double-bladed sword beside him. Wang Lun likely failed because he did not make any attempts to raise wide public support. He did not distribute captured wealth or food supplies, nor did he promise to lessen the tax burden. Unable to build up a support base, he was forced to quickly flee all three cities that he attacked in order to evade government troops. Though he passed through an area inhabited by almost a million peasants, his army never measured more than four thousand soldiers, many of whom had been forced into service. Beginning in 1794, two decades after Wang Lun's failed uprising, a movement also arose in the mountainous region that separates Sichuan from Hubei and Shaanxi in central China as tax protests. Here, the White Lotus led impoverished settlers into rebellion, promising personal salvation in return for their loyalty. Beginning as tax protests, the eventual rebellion gained growing support and sympathy from many ordinary people. The rebellion grew in number and power and eventually, into a serious concern for the government. A systematic program of pacification followed in which the populace was resettled in hundreds of stockaded villages and organized into militia. In its last stage, the Qing suppression policy combined pursuit and extermination of rebel guerrilla bands with a program of amnesty for deserters. The rebellion came to an end in 1804. A decree from the Daoguang Emperor admitted, \\"it was extortion by local officials that goaded the people into rebellion...\\" Using the arrest of sectarian members as a threat, local officials and police extorted money from people. Actual participation in sect activities had no impact on an arrest; whether or not monetary demands were met, however, did. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, there were also several White Lotus sects active in the area around the capital city of Peking. Lin Qing, another member of the Eight Trigrams sect within the White Lotus, united several of these sects and with them build an organization that he would later lead in the Eight Trigrams Uprising of 1813. Administrators also seized and destroyed sectarian scriptures used by the religious groups. One such official was Huang Yupian (), who refuted the ideas found in the scriptures with orthodox Confucian and Buddhist views in A Detailed Refutation of Heresy ( P≈çxi√© Xi√°ngbi√†n), which was written in 1838. This book has since become an invaluable source in understanding the beliefs of these groups. White Lotus adherents who collaborated with the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War were fought against by the Muslim General Ma Biao.http://military.china.com/zh_cn/dljl/krzz/01/11044207/20080919/15096066.html = Uses of the term \\"White Lotus\\" in later periods = While traditional historiography has linked many Maitreyist and millenarian uprisings during the Ming and Qing dynasties as all related to the White Lotus, there are reasons to doubt that such connections existed. B J Ter Haar has argued that the term \\"White Lotus\\" became a label applied by late Ming and Qing imperial bureaucrats to any number of different popular uprisings, millenarian societies or \\"magical\\" practices such as mantra recitation and divination. If this interpretation is correct, the steady rise in the number of White Lotus rebellions in imperial histories during the Ming and Qing does not necessarily reflect the increasing strength of a unified organization. Instead, this trend reflects a growing concern by imperial bureaucrats with any form of Buddhism practiced outside of the sanctioned frameworks of the monasteries. The White Lotus sect may have been one of the main ancestors of the Chinese organizations known as the Triads. The Triads were originally members and soldiers of the Tiandihui or \\"Heaven and Earth Society\\" during the period of the war between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Triads' formation was not for criminal purposes, but to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming to power. The White Lotus Society may have been one of five branches of the Heaven Earth Society which formed at the Shaolin Monastery from Ming loyalists. The Five Branches, known by some as the \\"Five Ancestors\\", were the Black, Red, White, Yellow and Green Lodges. After there was no longer any need for the triads on the battlefield, some high-level military leaders resorted to criminal activity in order to find means of survival.

In philately, the denomination is the \\"inscribed value of a stamp\\".Sutton, R.J. & K.W. Anthony. The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p.93. The denomination is not the same as the value of a stamp on the philatelic market, which is usually different, and the denominations of a country's stamps and money do not necessarily match. For instance, there might be a 47c stamp to pay a particular postal rate but there is unlikely to be a 47c coin.  No denomination shown  Where no denomination is shown, it may be because the stamp is deliberately non-denominated to pay the cost of a particular service, or because the stamp is not a postage stamp. It might be a cinderella stamp of some kind such as a poster stamp or charity label. =Letter-denominated first-class stamps= : Faced in 1978 with the problem of supplying stamps to satisfy an anticipated postal rate increase that had not yet been specifically determined, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp bearing the letter \\"A\\" instead of a numerical denomination, announcing that this stamp would cover whatever new first-class postal rate was approved by congress. Subsequent decades saw the issue of B, C, D, E, F, G and H stamps that similarly covered the periodic later rate increases. =Forever stamps= : In 2007 the United States Postal Service issued its first undenominated \\"Forever stamp,\\" which was guaranteed to remain valid for first-class postage despite any and all future postal rate increases. By 2011, the vast majority of new U. S. postal issues were forever stamps, although some new stamps still carried specific denominations. In 2015 the forever stamp was expanded into all other stamps (additional ounce, postcard, non-machinable surcharge, two ounce and three ounce) and stamps either have their intended purpose or the word \\"FOREVER\\" printed on them instead of a denomination.  Changes of denomination  German hyperinflation surcharge 1923. A 5 thousand mark stamp overprinted to change it to 2 million marks. Sometimes a stamp may have its denomination changed by the post office due to local circumstances. For instance, stocks of one value may be overprinted to show a different value due to stock shortages. In cases of hyper-inflation stamps have had their denomination changed by overprinting as existing denominations became worthless. In other cases, changes to the local currency have led to changes in denomination. For instance, when the Ryukyu Islands (at the time a United States protectorate) changed its currency from Yen to Dollars, a number of airmail stamps originally printed with Yen values were overprinted and re- denominated to cents in 1959‚Äì1960.  Hyperinflation Denominations  During periods of hyperinflation, non-overprinted postage stamps of extraordinary denominations have been issued. As one example, in Hungary, on 15 July 1946 a AP40,000 (Hungarian ad√≥peng≈ë) stamp featuring a diesel locomotive was issued. This was the equivalent of 80 quadrillion peng≈ë (P80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) See also *Bisects and splits (philately) *Face value *Non-denominated postage *Semi-postal  References  Category:Philatelic terminology ","title":"Denomination (postage stamp)"},{"id":"2098618","text":"1954 Felber M√∂ve The M√∂ve 101 was a microcar with egg-shaped coup√© bodywork based on a Felber Autoroller chassis.

The internal conversion coefficient may be empirically determined by the following formula: :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{number of de- excitations via electron emission}}{\\\\mbox{number of de-excitations via gamma- ray emission}} There is no valid formulation for an equivalent concept for E0 (electric monopole) nuclear transitions. There are theoretical calculations that can be used to derive internal conversion coefficients. Their accuracy is not generally under dispute, but since the quantum mechanical models they depend on only take into account electromagnetic interactions between the nucleus and electrons, there may be unforeseen effects which result in a conversion coefficient differing from one that is empirically determined. Internal conversion coefficients can be looked up from tables, but this is time-consuming. Computer programs have been developed (see the BrIcc Program) which present internal conversion coefficients quickly and easily. Theoretical calculations of interest are the R√∂sel, Hager-Seltzer, and the Band, superseded by the Band-Raman calculation called BrIcc. The Hager-Seltzer calculations omit the M and higher-energy shells on the grounds (usually valid) that those orbitals have little electron density at the nucleus and can be neglected. To first approximation this assumption is valid, upon comparing several internal conversion coefficients for different isotopes for transitions of about 100 keV. The Band and Band-Raman calculations assume that the M shell may contribute to internal conversion to a non-negligible extent, and incorporates a general term (called \\"N+\\") which takes into account the small effect of any higher shells there may be, while the R√∂sel calculation works like the Band, but does not assume that all shells contribute and so generally terminates at the N shell. Additionally, the Band-Raman calculation can now consider (\\"frozen orbitals\\") or neglect (\\"no hole\\") the effect of the electron vacancy; the frozen-orbitals approximation is considered generally superior.

He is listed as a founder of the Suez Canal Company.  Biography  Having taken advantage of a sound education that emphasized mathematics, drawing and painting, then having been given some experience at sea through the efforts of his father, Antoine-Marie, a naval officer, charting the coastal waters of Newfoundland, in 1814, aged fifteen. Having passed his entrance exams, young Linant embarked as a naval cadet on the frigate Cl√©op√¢tre, engaged on a mission to Greece, Syria, Palestine and Egypt, which he spent making drawings and doing relief mapping. One of the artists attached to the expedition having suddenly died, Linant was commissioned to replace him, drawing sites and ruins in Athens, Constantinople, Ephesus, Akka and Jerusalem. At Jaffa the expedition reached Damiatta by camel caravan, then sailed up the Nile to disembark at Cairo in December. The expedition was completed, but Linant decided not to return to France, and through a recommendation from the comte de Forbin, the expedition's director, briefly entered the service of the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, before setting out on a series of explorations that lasted from 1818 to 1830, which he described later in his M√©moires. In 1818‚Äì19 he was in lower Nubia, beyond the Cataracts of the Nile. In 1820 he joined the expedition of the French consul general and explorer Bernardino Drovetti to the oasis of Siwa in the Libyan Desert, where the oracle of Ammon had been consulted by Alexander the Great but to which no modern European had penetrated; his drawings illustrated the Voyage √† l'Oasis de Syouah, published by E. Jomard (1823). Within a few months he travelled with the Italian Alessandro Ricci to Sinai: the party left Cairo and followed the peninsula's eastern coast, passing through the Wells of Moses, Wadi Gharandel and Khazne Firaoun, to arrive at Maghara, where they made copies of the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Their intention to reach Petra was foiled by the insecurity of the area, but in returning to Cairo they passed through Sarbout el-Khadem and sketched its monuments. This first trip to Sinai enabled him to establish contacts with the Bedouin and prepare himself for the successful trip to Petra finally undertaken with L√©on de Laborde in 1828. Meantime he visited the Fayum in 1821, then was sent by the Englishman William John Bankes to the Sudan commissioned to get geographical information and draw the monuments there. He was gone from Cairo thirteen months from June 1821, discovering the ruins at Messaourat and at Naga, only slightly in advance of Fr√©d√©ric Cailliaud, the first European to reach Meroe. In 1824, Linant spent a couple of months in London, where the African Company proposed to support him in a voyage of exploration, as they had supported Burckhardt. After further travels in Nubia and Sudan, in 1827 he set out funded by the Association, to make his way as far up the White Nile as could be, in search of the fabled source of the Nile: tribal hostility forced him back at 13 degrees north latitude. In 1831 the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie of Paris commissioned a further attempt, which was postponed by the viceroy, who sent him instead to find the gold mines in Atbai. Ruins of Temple B700 of Jebel Barkal with relief of Senkamanisken clubbing enemies, drawn in 1821 by Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds In these travel Linant did not completely lose sight of his early experience in hydrology. In the Sinai in 1822 he had noted the traces of Trajan's canal, and had visited Suez and the peninsula's other lakes, and later he had roamed the Eastern Desert between the Nile and the Red Sea. \\"In 1827 and 1828\\" he wrote later, \\"I returned once more to the Isthmus, which I visited once again and its environs, and it was then that I began the first studies of a project of communication between the two seas.\\" These projects he discussed with Laborde as they recrossed the peninsula on the way to Petra in 1828. There is a valley in the Sinai, once his contracts with the African Association were successfully terminated, Linant \\"passed more than a year alone with a choice library in order to study seriously and without distractions in order to acquire what I lacked in scientific understanding to take up service with the Egyptian government in the character of an engineer.\\" =Linant as engineer= At his return to Cairo in 1831 Linant was named chief engineer of the public works of Upper Egypt, a position that associated him in a long and fruitful career with most of the great works of modernizing Egypt's network of irrigation canals, the grand lev√©es along the Nile. By 1837, fully in charge of public works in the Ministry of Public Instruction, he received the title of bey. All along, the idea of a communication between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea never left him. From 1830 he was expressing his ideas, first with the consul general of France, then with Ferdinand de Lesseps. In 1841 he submitted a preliminary plan for a canal to the Compagnie P√©ninsulaire et Orientale and in 1844, set before Lesseps his complete plans. In 1854 Lesseps obtained from the viceroy Muhammad Sa'id the firman for the canal concession on behalf of the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez, and Linant was named chief engineer, in which capacity he was soon assisted by the French hydraulics engineer Mougel, for Linant continued in charge of public works, as director general (1862), as Minister of Public Works (1869) and member of the viceroy's council. He retired in 1869 to write his vast memoir. In June 1873, the viceroy conferred upon him the title of pasha. He died leaving a vast accumulation of notes, memoirs, drawings, most of which remain unedited. A great number of visiting Europeans left their impressions of Linant.

As of 2011 census, it has a population of 950 inhabitants. It is the only place in Serbia that borders both Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina (Republika Srpska). History The history of the village dates back to Roman times as a military outpost on the river Sava (Savus River) against the Illyrians. The village has been destroyed and resurrected many times in its history. During World War II in 1943, Jamena was burned to the ground by the Croatian Nazi collaborators - the Ustashe. 2500 civilians were brutally murdered in a two-day rampage; there is a monument to the victims in the center of Jamena. The area and the surrounding forests where the scene of Partisan guerilla activity during World War II, there is a monument to the fighters on the side of the road heading towards Jamena near the army barracks. Since 1945, Jamena has flourished as a wealthy agricultural village on the outskirts of Serbia (Vojvodina). When Yugoslavia broke apart in 1991, Jamena lost its direct road to Moroviƒá and the rest of Serbia, because the only roads from the village go to Raƒçinovci and Stro≈°inci which are in Croatia. During the Yugoslav wars (1991‚Äì1995), the village was practically isolated from the rest of Serbia. The natality rate has been falling steadily and the village has rapidly declined in population. It was bombed in 1999 by Nato forces who killed one civilian. In the last few years, the population has steadied because of the people from abroad who have been working for years in Western Europe and who started building new homes in the village. Nowadays, the village is connected to the rest of Serbia by route 128.

It also borders Croatia, and there was a campaign to re-open the border with Croatia with the village of Stro≈°inci in 2007,Future border crossing Serbia-Croatia but nothing came of it, much to the dismay of residents from both sides of the border. There is a bus service that runs twice daily, in the morning and late afternoon, to the nearby town of ≈†id, from which people can travel to all major destinations in Serbia and neighbouring countries. Plans are under way to build a bridge over the river Sava to Bosnia and Hercegovina, construction should start in early 2008. To reach Jamena there is only one road from Moroviƒá which cuts through the forest and runs for approximately 20 km.

It currently competes in the ≈†id league, the club colors are red and white. Its ground has seating and shelter for about 300 spectators as well as standing areas. Every summer there is a mini pitch football tournament on the local courts in the village center. Other clubs include the \\"Sava\\" hunting club due to the large amount of game in the surrounding forests; game include deer, wild boar and pheasants. It shares the same forest often referred to as Tito's hunting ground with Moroviƒá. The area is also well known as a fishing area due to its close proximity to the Sava river as well as the Bosut river. There is also a ramp for launching boats on the Sava river in Jamena. As the village is located next to the Sava river there is a dedicated area for swimmers and bathers along the bank of the river about 200 meters upstream from the ferry crossing to Bosnia. Economy and features The village is largely agricultural as the soil around Jamena is very fertile, the main crops being corn, soy, wheat. The main stock breed and sold out of the village are hogs which are generally sold to large wholesalers for retail sale. The village contains 4 bars and 4 general stores as well as a local post office and a medical, dental and veterinary clinic.

The company also produces clothing ‚Äìthrough its subsidiary \\"Callaway Apparel\\"‚Äì. The line include polo shirts, fleeces, pants, sweaters, shorts. Another Callaway's subsidiary, \\"Cuater\\", produces golf shoes. The company sells its products through golf retailers and sporting goods retailers, through mass merchants, directly online, and through its pre-owned and trade-in services. Callway markets its products in more than 70 countries worldwide. The American company, based in Carlsbad, California, is the world's largest manufacturer of golf clubs. In past years, Callaway marketed products under the \\"Odyssey\\" putter brand, acquired in 1997, as well as \\"Top Flite\\", \\"Strata\\" and \\"Ben Hogan\\" brands picked up following the bankruptcy of Spalding's former golf division in 2003.  History  Callaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in LaGrange, Georgia, and was a graduate of Emory University. He had previously been successful in the textile and wine industries, and was also an avid golfer. Among his favorite club brands was Hickory Sticks USA, which was known for producing clubs with hickory shafts and steel cores. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz, and Tony Manzoni. When Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they began seeking investors and approached Callaway, who had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. In 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks USA and the company was renamed \\"Callaway Hickory Stick USA.\\" In 1983, he became the company's president and moved its headquarters to Carlsbad, California where he could be found selling clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for another $400,000. The company's name was changed to its present name in 1988.Golf - CBSSports.com CBS Sports - Golf In 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and, through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales, was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. He was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth. Golf club made by Callaway In 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter was named chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and that of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.Callaway Golf Company - Company History In 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges, constructed from carbon steel with modified U-grooved faces.Callaway Forged Wedge In 1996, Callaway announced development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing the ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company invested $170 million in research and development, and construction of the production facility. Callaway Golf Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. They settled on only two versions of the Rule 35 ball‚Äîchoosing to develop a \\"complete-performance\\" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company's product development objectives as follows: \\"We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer.\\"Callaway Golf Company Online Case In 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters. This led to introduction of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000. Ely Callaway resigned as CEO and President in 1996, remaining as Chairman of the Board. Donald H. Dye was named CEO and President. Callaway also continued as President and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company. In 1998 he again became President and CEO of Callaway Golf Company, but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001. Ron Drapeau assumed his positions.IPA Bulletin In 2003 Drapeau announced the company's intention to purchase Top- Flite Golf and its Ben Hogan Golf division, soon after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Diplomas American ISC has been accredited since 1984 by AdvancED, the leading American Certification Authority for excellence education development with more than 100 years of experience and active in 70 countries. The core curriculum, texts, supplementary materials and teachers are similar in quality to the K-12 educational system in the United States. The main curriculum at all levels includes Language, Arts, Literature, Math, Science, Social Studies, Modern Languages, Information Technology, Physical Education and Health. Brazilian ISC is accredited by MEC as a Brazilian school until Grade 12 and all students are required to use the Brazilian components of the curriculum. The classes of Language, Literature, History of Brazil and Brazilian Geography are taught in Portuguese. The other areas of knowledge are included in the American program. International Baccalaureate (IB) The school also offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP), an intensive and challenging program designed for 11th and 12th grade students. The IBDP is recognized around the world as a high school qualification for students planning to attend a university on the European continent. As a result of successful completion, students have the opportunity to obtain permanent college credits. The US diploma is mandatory for all students; the Brazilian diploma is mandatory for all Brazilian citizens; and the IB diploma is optional.  Early Childhood Center (ECC 1 through Kindergarten)  In the Early Childhood Center (ECC), children find a place where they are subject to their own experiences and are able to develop emotional and conceptual understanding through experimentation, research and the transformation of the space around them. In this way, inspired by the educational approach of Reggio Emilia schools, teachers listen to the students and propose the development of long-term projects, in which they are protagonists of their learning. This allows children to take initiatives and feel encouraged to learn and explore the world around them. Elementary School (Grades 1 through 5) Elementary School engage students in active learning to develop learners' skills as well as habits related to character and citizenship. The approach to literacy is based on the Reader's and Writer's Workshop, a customized methodology for international schools in which students in grades 5 through 8 apply learning in a meaningful way. In addition, other subjects are taught by hands-on projects that develop in the student the curiosity and the proactivity in relation to the learning process itself. Middle School (Grades 6 through 8) Middle School is based on interdisciplinary collaboration, in which different disciplines work together on the same subject. This integration aims to stimulate ethics, independent and enduring learning, critical thinking, and decision-making skills that prepare students for the next phase, High School. Students continue to apply Reader's and Writer's Workshop practices in English classes, and use the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for the Social Studies curriculum. In Grade 6, they are introduced to Service Learning activities. Middle School also focuses on social and emotional learning through the Advisory Program. High School (Grades 9 through 12) High School is focused on the student's experience, which plays a key role in their own learning process. The 21st Century Classroom and the Blended Learning concept are examples of teaching methodologies that promote the development of social skills such as teamwork, collaboration and leadership, as well as personal skills such as critical thinking, logical reasoning applied to problem solving and a globalized perspective. Service Learning activities continue to be developed as well as the use of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Social Studies. The development of social and emotional learning is accomplished through the 360 Wildcat Program. The 360 Wildcat Program represents ISC's commitment to the full development of our students. Social and emotional learning is an incredibly important and often underestimated area of study. Students in grades 9 and 10 learn about concepts such as healthy habits and international citizenship while practicing skills such as perseverance and the ability to discuss controversial issues. An interesting aspect of the program is that students experience the outdoors through hiking, surfing lessons and other activities. Middle and High School also have Robotics, Programming, Digital Arts, Audiovisual Production and Music Production classes. In Arts, there is Choir, Band, Theater and Visual Arts. There are also more than 20 Personalized Learning activities, including French, Cooking, Climbing and Independent Exploitation. Extracurricular Program After classes, ISC offers more than 100 extracurricular activities through the ISC Academy, a program designed to provide students of all ages with sports, arts and academic activities with free and paid options. For parents and staff, ISC offers the Wildcat Wellness Program with free activities such as yoga, zumba, French and English classes. ISC is equipped with an Arena. There is a dance room, music room, art room, climbing wall, work out area and two basketball, volleyball, and futsal courts.

Peter Henry Geoffrey Morgan (3 November 1919 ‚Äì 20 October 2003) was an English sports car manufacturer and Chairman of Morgan Motor Company (MMC) from 1959 until his death in 2003. Peter inherited the Malvern, Worcestershire-based company from his father H.F.S. Morgan. Despite pressures to \\"modernize\\", he maintained the family firm's traditions of hand-crafted workmanship and slow organic growth until his son Charles took over as managing director. Morgan was born in Chestnut Villa, his parents' house which was adjacent to the car factory in Malvern Link and where he grew up alongside his four sisters. He attended a local preparatory school, the Link School, before going to Oundle School in Northamptonshire. On leaving school he attended the Chelsea College of Automobile and Aero Engineering obtaining a first class diploma in 1940. His first job was with the British Ermeto Corporation but he shortly left and joined the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) where he served in the motor workshops in Sierra Leone before taking over responsibility for running the Nairobi workshops and being promoted to Captain. he was demobilised in 1946. In 1947 he joined the Morgan Motor Company as a draughtsman and joined the board as a director in 1949 becoming vice chairman in 1951. His first major project was the re-introduction of the Morgan 4/4 car in 1955. When his father H.F.S. Morgan died in 1959, he took over as chairman and had difficulties sorting a serious tax problem. Morgan retired on his eightieth birthday in 1999 but remained on the board as Chairman until 2003. Outside work he had a great interest in steam power and built an extensive ride-on miniature railway in his garden. He married Jane Christie, a friend of his sisters', at Maidenhead towards the end of 1940 and they had three children, Sonia, Jill and Charles. The couple divorced in the 1970s. Morgan married again in 1982 to a Canadian, Heather Williams. They remained deeply devoted until his death.

The screenplay is written by Lenore J. Coffee based on a novel by Stuart Engstrand.. The film marks Davis' last appearance as a contract actress for Warner, after eighteen years with the studio. She tried several times to walk away from the film (which only caused the production cost to go through the roof), but Warner refused to release her from their employment contract. She remembered the project as \\"a terrible movie\\",. and her death scene at end in the film as \\"the longest death scene ever seen on the screen\\". Plot Rosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city. Lewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down. During a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will. To prevent that eventuality, she shoots and kills Moose during the hunt. She is acquitted of this act by claiming she thought he was a deer. To Rosa's consternation, Latimer wants to avoid \\"any dirt\\" associated with them and Moose's demise; he suggests they wait \\"a month or so\\" before they go through with their plans. At home, Lewis assumes that Rosa will come to feel good about having a baby, but Latimer's change of plans, and her inherent resentment of the pregnancy, drives her to confess both her affair with Latimer and that she deliberately murdered Moose. Lewis says that he only cares about his baby and that after she gives birth, she can go where ever she pleases. From his office window, Lewis happens to see Rosa boarding a bus. He follows her to a neighboring town where she is sitting in a 'lawyer's office'; she reluctantly leaves with him but, on the way home, tricks him into stopping their car and going to the trunk. She gets out of the vehicle and throws herself down an embankment, desperate to abort. The result is peritonitis and a raging fever which makes her delirious. She enlists Jenny, her housekeeper, to help her dress and she leaves the house to catch the train to Chicago. Near the tracks, she collapses and dies.

Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 278: ‚Äú[Vidor], at the time, didn‚Äôt like the film himself.‚Äù And p. 271: Vidor: The film ‚Äúlooks better from a distance‚Äù Film historian David Melville suggests that Warner Brothers offered Bette Davis, the aging seventeen-year veteran of the studio, the role of Rosa Moline anticipating she would reject the project, a move that would allow executives to void her contract. She completed the film nevertheless, but it would be her last with Warner Brothers.Melville, 2013: ‚ÄúHollywood rumour claims that Warner Bros. only cast her as a ploy ‚Äì hoping she would rebel and walk out on her contract.‚Äù Baxter 1976 p. 75: ‚Äú...Warner's happily freed the aging star and she escaped from burdens of roles like that of Rosa [Moline] which mocked her increasingly middle-aged appearance.‚Äù Vidor and Davis feuded over direction of the picture throughout its filming. Baxter 1976 p. 75: ‚Äú[Davis] battled with Vidor constantly‚Ä¶‚Äù In an especially dramatic scene in the filming where Davis berates her ‚Äúdull-but- decent doctor husband‚Äù (Joseph Cotten), Vidor demanded ‚Äúgreater vehemence‚Äù in her delivery. In response, Davis went to Jack Warner to ask that Vidor be replaced with another director, which Warner declined. Vidor was unaware of the request until the shooting was completed.Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 274: See footnote on details. Also p. 236: Davis went to Jack Warner ‚Äúto have [Vidor] fired‚Äù over the incident. And Vidor unaware of it until after the film was finished. Davis‚Äô complaints concerning Vidor had the opposite effect and spurred Warner executives to cancel her contract, a finale satisfactory to both parties.Baxter 1976 p. 75: Davis ‚Äúused her irritation at [Vidor] as a lever to evade the rest of her Warner Brothers contract.‚Äù Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 236:‚Äú...Davis‚Äô threats to quit backfired; they were apparently an opportunity Warner's had been seeking, and her film was the last with the studio, for which she had worked for seventeen years.)‚Äù Melville, 2013: ‚ÄúHollywood rumor claims that Warner Bros. only cast her as a ploy ‚Äì hoping she would rebel and walk out on her contract. If so, they were sadly disappointed. Davis completed the film (although she did try, allegedly, to have Vidor fired as director) but it turned out to be her last for Warner's, a studio where she had reigned .‚Äù The final cut of the movie appeared without the sequence depicting Rosa‚Äôs abortion, an edit that Vidor only discovered when he viewed the picture as a local theater.Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 236‚Äú...Jack Warner had had its abortion sequence removed from release prints‚Äù a fact that Vidor had not been award until viewing his film in a theater. Location The scenes featuring the mythical town of \\"Loyalton, Wisconsin\\" were actually shot in Loyalton, California, a small, picturesque village in Sierra County. Reception Bette Davis =Critical response= Film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed the film upon its release, writing, > To be sure, the script by Lenore Coffee offers little for her to do but run > through the usual banalities of an infidelity yarn ... For those who have > not been embarrassed by pretensions in a fairly long time, let us recommend > the climax of this incredibly artificial film‚Äîthe final scene in which the > lady, apparently burning up with a bad case of peritonitis, drags herself > out of bed, pulls herself to her mirror, smears make-up on her face and gets > dressed in disheveled finery to stagger forth toward the railroad tracks and > death. With the clashing refrain of 'Chicago' beating in her head, she pays > for her selfish sins and follies. Quite an experience, we'd say ... Not to > be coy about it, we can see no 'Oscars' in the offing for this film. Writing in 2004, Dennis Schwartz was nearly as dismissive, summarizing the plot as \\"bombastic melodrama\\", but noting that, \\"The film's only redeeming value is in its almost camp presentation, which might find some in the audience entertained by the overblown acting on Bette's part (she caricatures herself) and the intense but laughable soap opera story.\\" In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. =Censorship= The film originally received a ‚ÄòC‚Äô classification from the Legion of Decency because of its abortion elements. This classification initially impacted the film‚Äôs box office, forcing the studio to negotiate cuts in order for the film to be reclassified as a ‚ÄòB.‚Äô =Box Office= Variety said the film earned $1.5 million. According to Warner Bros accounts the film earned $1,331,000 domestically and $407,000 foreign. Theme Novelist Stuart Engstrand in his 1948 novel of the same name describes anti-heroine Rosa Moline as the ‚ÄúWisconsin [Madame] Bovary‚Äù, a reference to 19th Century novelist Gustave Flaubert‚Äôs doomed character in his 1856 Madame Bovary. Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 271 And p. 308: Durgnat considers Beyond the Forest and Flaubert‚Äôs Madame Bovary ‚Äúapproximate pairs‚Äù in theme. Rosa, who considers herself the victim of ‚Äú[petty] bourgeois mediocrity‚Äù is the ‚Äúsmall-town girl so consumed with craving for the city [Chicago] that she becomes what looks like a camp caricature of herself.‚ÄùDurgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 271-272 Vidor‚Äôs portrayal of Rosa conveys a sympathy for Rosa‚Äôs life force, ‚Äúfrustrated and deranged though it is.‚ÄùDurgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 272Melville, 2013: ‚ÄúHer defeat and, finally, her downfall take on an inevitability that tilts Beyond the Forest away from melodrama and towards tragedy. Rosa may be a ham, but she is as irrevocably doomed as The Trojan Women.‚ÄùAnd ‚ÄúBeyond the Forest is one of a very few Hollywood films that invite us to question the forbidden and violent impulses of its lead character ‚Äì not to mention our own forbidden and violent impulses, should we dare to empathize with her.‚Äù And: Andrew Britton, one of the film‚Äôs most vocal defenders, insisted that ‚ÄúKing Vidor derives a critique of women‚Äôs oppression as audacious as any the cinema has given us from the story of a woman whose values and behavior are, on the face of it, merely reprehensible‚Äù Vidor diverges from Flaubert‚Äôs social outlook in that he expresses a genuine sympathy for the small factory town and its community relationships that that Rosa finds repellent.Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 272: ‚Äú...Vidor appreciates the [social and economic] life his Madame Bovary [Rosa Moline] despises.‚Äù p. 271 (emphasis in original) Rosa‚Äôs long sought destination, Chicago, is depicted as a threatening domain of heavy industrial oppression, heightened by a Max Steiner score that emphasizes the city‚Äôs ‚Äúbrutality‚Äù. In contrast, Vidor portrays the rural industry in the small town Loyalton, Wisconsin as comporting with the ‚Äúhuman pace‚Äù of life in the local community, the ‚Äúpollution-belching mill‚Äù a ‚Äútiny blemish.‚ÄùDurgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 273-274: ‚ÄúIn contrast to the city‚Äôs brutal industry, the film takes in its stride what is virtually a little documentary on small-town community, whose sawmills and rural industry set the slow, stolid human pace to which Rosa‚Äôs nervous intensity cannot adapt, and into whose neighborly concerns she cannot sink her spiritual roots.‚Äù Hampton, 2013: ‚ÄúLoyalton‚Äôs one tiny blemish is that it is built around a pollution-belching mill that runs day and night, and after dark the sawdust flames turn the townscape into a glowing inferno. Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 278: ‚Äú[Vidor], at the time, didn‚Äôt like the film himself. But Billy Wilder‚Äôs enthusiasm for it strikes us as completely founded. It is one of the most deeply driven of the studies in the monstrosity of female folly that Hollywood filmmakers from Wilder to Aldrich, and American dramatists from Tennessee Williams to Edward Albee, have done with a mixture of moralistic wildness and mordant fascination that only looks like camp.‚Äù (emphasis in original) Melville, 2013: ‚Äú[Davis] staggers to her bedroom mirror and smears herself, grotesquely, with lipstick and mascara. Her reflection leering out at her (and us) is an eerie flash-forward to Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (Robert Aldrich, 1962). Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 278:‚ÄúBeyond the Forest is rooted- unusually for an American film. And still more for an American ‚Äòwoman‚Äôs drama‚Äô - in the sense of a town‚Äôs economics...Rosa‚Äôs one unforgivable sin isn‚Äôt adultery‚Äô; it‚Äôs collecting the debts owed him by the town [residents].‚Äù Legacy =Who‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf?= Vidor‚Äôs film noir-like melodrama of a middle-aged woman trapped in a small town she despises and married to a husband she regards as a weakling was provided a fulsome tribute in playwright Edward Albee Who‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.Melville, 2013: What a dump ‚Äúrecycled by Edward Albee in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Hampton, 2013: ‚Äú...her saintly sap of a husband (Joseph Cotton at his most obsequiously masochistic).‚Äù Married couple Martha and George, whose relationship is reminiscent of Bette Davis/Joseph Cotten in Vidor‚Äôs film, have an exchange over a scene in Beyond the Forest, that opens with Martha invoking the now-famous line, ‚ÄúWhat a dump.‚Äù: Film historian Raymond Durgnat observed that ‚ÄúVidor‚Äôs exasperated melodrama‚Äù in Beyond the Forest ‚Äúwears a lot better after the resurgence of high melodrama‚Äù that appeared in Edward Albee‚Äôs Who‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 271 Comedienne Carol Burnett incorporated the epithet into her routines on The Carol Burnett Show.Hampton, 2013: ‚Äú‚ÄòWhat a dump‚Äô, a phrase both Edward Albee and Carol Burnett borrowed to great effect.)‚Äù =Accolades= Composer Max Steiner was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture) in 1950.

These strong radar echoes are associated with the extremely cold temperatures that occur above continental Antarctica during the summer. Rocket and radar measurements indicate that a partial reflection from a multitude of ion layers and constructive interference causes at least some of the PMSE. Generally PMSE exhibits dramatic variations in height and intensity as well as large variations in Doppler shift. PMSE exhibit strong signal power enhancements of scattering cross section at VHF radar frequencies in the range 50 MHz to 250 MHz, at times even to over 1 GHz, that occur in summer at high latitudes. The peak PMSE height is slightly below the summer mesopause temperature minimum at 88 km, and above the noctilucent cloud (NLC) and/or polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) layer at 83‚Äì84 km. The usual instrument for observing PMSE is a VHF Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) radar, although LIDARs and sounding rockets have also been used. PMSE is believed to be caused by structural irregularities in the ionospheric electron density at lower altitudes. The exact cause of PMSE is not yet known, although theorists have proposed steep electron density gradients, heavy positive ions, dressed aerosols, gravity waves and turbulence as possible explanations. PMSE occurs in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and is sometimes accompanied by noctilucent clouds.

The black-and-white film is set in New York City and stars Ray Milland, Charles Laughton, and Maureen O'Sullivan. Elsa Lanchester and Harry Morgan, in an early film role, also appear. Noel Neill has an uncredited part as an elevator operator very early in the film.. Plot The film opens with George Stroud (Ray Milland), editor-in-chief of Crimeways magazine, hiding from building security inside the \\"big clock.\\" The clock is the largest and most sophisticated clock ever built; it dominates the lobby of the Janoth Publications building in New York City, where he works. The film flashes back to thirty-six hours earlier. Stroud is eager to go on a long-postponed honeymoon in Wheeling, West Virginia, with his wife Georgette (Maureen O'Sullivan) and son. His tyrannical boss, Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton) wants him to stay and follow up on a missing persons story Stroud has just cracked, but Stroud refuses and Janoth fires him. Stroud goes to a bar to drink and is distracted by the attentions of Janoth's glamorous mistress, Pauline York (Rita Johnson), who proposes a blackmail plan against Janoth. When Stroud loses track of time and misses their scheduled train, Georgette angrily leaves for Wheeling without him. Stroud spends the evening drinking and going out on the town with York at various locations, buying a painting and a sundial. Stroud and York go to York's apartment, but she sees Janoth arriving, and Stroud leaves. Janoth sees someone leaving but does not recognize Stroud in the dark. Janoth assumes York is cheating on him, leading to a quarrel which ends with him striking York with the sundial and killing her. Janoth goes to his assistant, Hagen (George Macready), and tells him what happened, intending on going to the police and confessing. But Hagen talks him out of it and convinces him that they can frame the man Janoth saw leaving York's apartment for the crime. Janoth decides to use the resources of Crimeways to find the man instead of calling the police. Stroud has since caught up with his wife and son in West Virginia and tells her that he has been fired (but leaves out his adventures with York). Janoth calls to re-hire him, to lead the effort to find the mystery man (leaving out any mention of York). He mentions enough details for Stroud to know that the mystery man is himself. He reluctantly agrees to return to his job and lead the manhunt, to Georgette's disappointment. During the manhunt, Stroud has to appear to lead the investigation diligently, and at the same time, prevent the investigation from identifying him as its target. Meanwhile, he must also secretly carry out his own investigation to prove Janoth's guilt. Eventually York is identified by the Crimeways team and witnesses are found that saw her out on the town with the mystery man. These witnesses are brought to the Janoth Building. One is eccentric artist Louise Patterson (Elsa Lanchester), who did the painting that was purchased by Stroud. Asked to paint a portrait of the mystery man, she produces a modernist abstract of blobs and swirls. Stroud tries to avoid the witnesses, but one of them sees and recognizes him as the mystery man. Stroud slips away before the witness points him out to the investigators, but now the investigators know that the mystery man is in the building, though not who he is. All exits from the building are sealed, and everyone must leave by the main door, with the witnesses watching for the mystery man. Building security men sweep the building to flush out the wanted man. Stroud evades the dragnet by various maneuvers, finally hiding in the clock (ending the flashback segment of the film). In the climax of the film, Stroud confronts Janoth and Hagen. He presents evidence which appears to point to Hagen as the killer. Hagen implores Janoth to clear him, but Janoth tells him only that he will provide him the best possible legal defense. Enraged, Hagen turns on Janoth and reveals that Janoth killed York and he helped cover it up. Janoth shoots Hagen and flees. Janoth tries to escape in an elevator, but the elevator car is stuck floors below (jammed there by Stroud earlier while evading the security men); Janoth falls down the elevator shaft to his death. Cast * Ray Milland as George Stroud * Charles Laughton as Earl Janoth * Maureen O'Sullivan as Georgette Stroud * George Macready as Steve Hagen * Rita Johnson as Pauline York * Elsa Lanchester as Louise Patterson * Henry Morgan as Bill Womack * Harold Vermilyea as Don Klausmeyer * Dan Tobin as Ray Cordette * Richard Webb as Nat Sperling * Elaine Riley as Lily Gold * Luis Van Rooten as Edwin Orlin, a reporter * Bobby Watson as Morton Spaulding * Lloyd Corrigan as Colonel Jefferson Randolph aka McKinley * Frank Orth as Burt * Margaret Field as Second Secretary * Noel Neill as Elevator Operator * Al Ferguson as Guard (uncredited) Morgan's screen name later would become \\"Henry 'Harry' Morgan\\" and eventually Harry Morgan, to avoid confusion with the popular humorist of the same name. Production Paramount bought the rights to the novel before publication. (Fearing's earlier novel The Hospital (1939) had been a best seller.) The purchase price was a reported $45,000. Jonathan Latimer was assigned to write the script and Ray Milland to star. Leslie Fenton was announced as director but he was held up on Saigon so John Farrow took over. Filming began February 17, 1947. Charles Laughton was cast as the villain. This was Maureen O'Sullivan's first film in five years, since Tarzan's New York Adventure, after which she had concentrated on raising her family. She did it as a favor for her husband, director John Farrow. Reception The film was very well received by critics, and as of September 7, 2020, holds a 100% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times extolled the film's virtues as a thriller, writing, \\"When you hear the musical chime at the end of this ticking review of The Big Clock, it will be exactly the time for all devotees of detective films to make a mental memorandum to see it without possible fail.\\" He added that the film \\"is a dandy clue-chaser of the modern chromium-plated type [and] requires close attention from the start ... Scriptwriter Jonathan Latimer and Director John Farrow have fetched a film which is fast-moving, humorous, atmospheric and cumulative of suspense.\\" Film critic Bruce Eder wrote, \\"The Big Clock is a near-perfect match for the book, telling in generally superb visual style a tale set against the backdrop of upscale 1940s New York and offering an early (but accurate) depiction of the modern media industry.\\". In 1998 film writer David N. Meyer wrote, \\"More screwball comedy than noir, The Big Clock's big moments derive from snappy dialogue and over-the-top humor.\\" Dennis Schwartz wrote in 2004 that \\"John Farrow directs this thrilling psychological film noir with style, though it's barely a work of noir in the full sense of that genre.\\" In 2001, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills. The Big Clock is 27th on the list of \\"Most Heart Pounding Movies\\". Remakes The story was remade in 1976 as Police Python 357 and in 1987 as No Way Out with Kevin Costner. The 1948 film is closer to the novel. The 1976 remake, on the other hand, updated the events to the Orl√©ans Police Department in France, whereas the 1987 remake updated the events to the United States Department of Defense in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War.

In the renewal of this treaty in 1208 he suggested that the Teutonic Order and Hospitallers should make a new peace treaty offer with Malek-Adel. The accord was criticised by Pope Innocent III. There were few military actions during his rule; the Fourth Crusade never arrived in the Holy Land. The King of Armenia was in opposition to the Knights regarding the Gastein stronghold.

Dotted lines represent relationships on which Schr√∂der was unclear. H√°lfdanar saga Eysteinssonar is a legendary saga from early 14th century Iceland about Halfdan Eysteinsson. The main events appear to take place in the 9th century. Halfdan's grandfather was √ûr√°ndr, the eponymous king of Trondheim, who in turn was the son of S√¶mingr, king of H√•logaland and son of Odin. S√¶mingr had married Nauma who had given her name to Namdalen. √ûr√°ndr had married Dagm√¶r, the sister of Svanhv√≠t, the heroine of Hr√≥mundar saga Gripssonar, and they had had the sons Eysteinn and Eirikr inn v√≠√∞f√∂rli. Eirikr is the hero of Eireks saga v√≠√∞f√∂rla and discovered √ìd√°insakr. Eysteinn married √Åsa, the daughter of Sigurd Hart, and √Åslaug, the daughter of Sigurd Snake-in- the-Eye. They had several sons, of whom Halfdan was one. It deals with Eysteinn's adventures in Staraja Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), his conquest of Alaborg, and the adventures of his son Halfdan.

Demographics Climate Language The majority of the population speak Eastern Miraya, an Albay Bikol language of Inland Bikol group of languages. The language is also spoken in four towns of Albay and some parts of Pilar and Castilla, Sorsogon. It is mutually intelligible with Western Miraya. People of Donsol can also speak and understand Tagalog or Filipino, the national language, and English. Religion The majority of the people adhere to Catholicism and each barangay has a patron saint and fiestas are held annually. Iglesia ni Cristo is the second largest religion of the population and has several local congregations in the municipality.  Tourism  =Whale shark (butanding) viewing= Swimming with whale sharks, locally known as butanding, was featured as the Best Animal Encounter in Asia by Time magazine in 2004. Whale sharks can be seen between November and June, with presence peaking between February and May. The presence of whale sharks in the town of Donsol was known to the local residents for more than 100 years, but the locals believed these gentle giants were dangerous. This wrong notion changed when on December 26, 1997, a group of scuba divers led by Romir Aglugub ‚Äì a PADI diving instructor, discovered their presence, interacted with, and came in contact with the whale sharks. Even the members of the diving group of Romir were having second thoughts about whether the fish is docile, until the instructor led the way into the water and came in contact with the whale sharks. Copy of video footage taken by the group was passed on to the media and the WWF-Philippines. By March 1998, Donsol became world-class tourist destination and now known as the ‚ÄúWhale Shark Capital of the World‚Äù. Butanding whale shark (Donsol, Sorsogon) Interaction with the whale sharks is regulated by the local Department of Tourism (DOT) office. WWF guidelines are generally observed to protect the sharks. Rules include limiting the number of swimmers per boat to six, prohibiting scuba divers, and requiring staying farther than three meters from the sharks. In recent years the number of male sharks have out-numbered female sharks by 20:1. Generally, the females that are seen are large mature adults in the 7m ~ 9m range. Increasing numbers of sharks show propeller marks on their backs. Anecdotal evidence from local fishermen suggests that prop strikes are from fishing boats in the off-season, rather than from tourist boats during the main February‚ÄìJune tourist season. In 2006 five sharks were found dead on the surface of the water, within 30 miles of Donsol. They had all been shot at close range. One shark had 13 bullet wounds to the head. The locals blame this on commercial fishermen shooting the sharks if they are caught in their nets. Manta rays, which are also protected in the Philippines, are also over-fished and sold in local markets in the Sorsogon area. Groups from Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines make up the largest groups of visitors. Most tourists book guided tours with dive centers familiar with whale shark interaction. =Food= Bicolano delicacies are plentiful in Donsol. Bicolano cuisine is well known for dishes cooked in \\"gata\\" or coconut cream. A famous dish to try is \\"laing\\" or \\"gabi\\", which is dried taro leaves cooked in coconut cream with cuts of meat or fish. Another famous Bicolano dish available in Donsol is \\"Bicol Express\\" which is pork stir fried with shrimp paste, heavy coconut cream, and green chilli peppers. It is a spicy dish that is best eaten with hot, steamed rice. A Filipino favourite is a dish called Sisig. Sisig is deep fried pork simmered in Calamansi juice, salt, pepper, and chilli peppers. It is eaten with hot, steamed rice or as a bar snack. There are a few restaurants in Donsol that serve these dishes. =Accommodations= Tourism continues to develop piecemeal in Donsol. The first hotel in the area is the Amor Farm Beach Resort, established in 1997, followed by the Woodland Beach Resort in 1998 that started off as a family vacation house. Interest to visit the quaint and quiet town grew as soon as news of whale shark sightings grew amongst the international marine biologist community. Tourists can now avail rooms that cater to all financial budgets, from the backpacker to the family vacationer from various resorts and homestays in Donsol. Most establishments accept only cash, but there is an ATM in Donsol located inside the Municipal Town Hall. There now are several resorts that accept credit cards. Giddy's Place PADI Dive Resort in the town center and Elysia Beach Resort in Dancalan are two of them. Landlines are non existent in Donsol and most rely on mobile telephones. Internet service came to Donsol in 2008 using cellular technology. There are a few internet shops in town. Fruit stand, Donsol =Other attractions= Donsol has a not so known, but equally unique, night firefly tour and shrimp-catching night tour available all-year round. Donsol also is becoming the best jump-off and base for divers to the Manta Bowl and San Miguel Island in Ticao due to the existence of better tourist facilities than the other rural towns. Diving in Donsol itself is not allowed. Donsol also is a great trekking and biking site, due mainly to the abundance of hilly areas and fields.

According to the , it has a population of people. Gubat is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. The people who live here speak the Gubat language which is also a dialect of Waray-Waray of Eastern Visayas, a Southern Sorsoganon sub-language and they were called Gubatnons. Geography Gubat is in the south-eastern part of Luzon Island, along the coast of the Pacific Ocean on the Bicol Peninsula. It is the third largest town in the province of Sorsogon. It is divided into 2 districts: the North District and South District. =Barangays= Gubat is politically subdivided into 42 barangays. Barangays with (Poblacion) indicate that barangay is part of the town proper or poblacion =Climate= History Gubat was originally a big barrio of Bulusan, inhabited by a few Tagalogs, Visayans and Albayanons who travelled on foot to hunt wild animals. These people built their homes close to the shore and called their location Buri, which today is the barrio of Buenavista. In 1764, Gubat finally became a town with Don Pedro Manook, the first Teniente del Barrio, also becoming the first gobernadorcillo. The town proper is named after Don Pedro Manook. The word \\"g√∫bat\\" means forest in Tagalog. However, the name applied to the town is derived from the verb \\"guinobat\\", a term used by the natives which means \\"raided\\". In the early days when Christians and Muslims were constantly at odds, Muslim pirates would come in from the southern seas to raid the town. Because of the frequent raids, the town was referred to as \\"guinobat\\" which eventually became \\"Gubat\\". Legend has it that during one of those raids, the pastor along with the townspeople held up a statue of St. Anthony to ward off the attack, praying for a miracle. In one account, it was said that the child Jesus in St. Anthony's arms drove back the pirates. St. Anthony of Padua became the town's patron saint and his feast day is lavishly celebrated as an official parish and town holiday every 13 June. The town settlers had to move a number of times before finally deciding to settle at a place they considered safe and peaceful. Eventually, they began to expand, laying out permanent streets, the first of which are what we now know as Luna and Calderon Streets. The main parish church itself has an interesting history. In 1768, the people decided to build a church. The locals, being poor, urged the town captain, Don Juan Bonifacio, to require all men to contribute one cubic meter of \\"talaksan\\" (coral stone) apiece. It took ten years of preparation and it was not until 1778 that construction finally started. Although it has since undergone several renovations, the church foundation is still the original one built in 1778. The rectory is the oldest and one of the only two remaining rectories dating back that far in the entire Bicol region. In November 2006, Gubat became the site of a scientific expedition by astronomers Dr. Armando Lee, Bamm Gabriana, and Rochelle Derilo to observe the rare Mercury transit. Gubat was the best town in Luzon to observe the event. Demographics =Religions= Although, the dominant religion is Roman Catholicism, there are Gubatnons devoted to: *Iglesia ni Cristo *Protestant Evangelical Baptist *Islam (some traders and residents) *Buddhism (Chinese traders and residents) *Members Church of God International * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints * Seventh Day Adventist * Baptist Economy The main livelihoods of the people, then and now, are agriculture and fishing. Harvest times for rice crops are from April to May, and December. Fishing is year-round. Forestry products are also source of income here. Transportation Bus Terminal in Gubat Gubat can be reached mostly through land transport from Manila by bus, taking about 12 hours. There are several bus companies that operates daily from Manila to Gubat and vice versa: Alps The Bus Inc., JVH Transport/Pamar, Elavil Tours Phils. Inc., Raymond Transportation, St.Jude Transit, CUL Transport, DLTBCo., Penafrancia Tours/RSL/Isarog and Philtranco. There are also jeepneys that provide transportation to Sorsogon City, Bulusan, Barcelona, Prieto-Diaz, Casiguran, Irosin and local barangays like Tigkiw, Bentuco and Benguet. Local tricycles travels to the innermost barangays like Union, Bulacao, Rizal, Cabigaan and Sangat.

The sand bottom beach breaks of Barangays Ariman and Buenavista (Dangkalan and Rizal Beach) produce 2 to 5 feet waves from September to May. With the formation of Gubat Bay Surfers by Bidge Villarroya and surfboards donated by the Local Government Unit under Mayor Ding Ramos, surfing is more accessible to the local population and tourists alike. The new group of Gubat Sorsogon Surfer's Association, still under Bidge Villarroya is now performing well in the National Surf Competition Scene, winning 5 national surf championships and numerous finalist positions. Gubat is the Top 1 in Ngo Sport Airsoft Society by the NGO Bicol Sorsogon Chapter.

According to the , it has a population of people. Its local tourism is considered to have a great potential, as ecological tourism is becoming popular worldwide. Geography Irosin is the only land-locked municipality in the province. =Barangays= Irosin is politically subdivided into 28 barangays. =Climate= History Earlier than 1847, Irosin was a far inland valley unspoiled by human settlers and covered by vast forest expanse teeming with wild animals. Irosin was among the last places in the Philippines to be populated. Most of the natives during the early 1800s lived along the coastal areas where it was more accessible to commercial, travel and communication activities at the time. The place had been an undisturbed sanctuary for wildlife until settlers from Bulusan came in search of wild quarry and rattan. These pioneers, using the slash-and-burn method, cleared a settlement beside a river which gave birth to a clearing called Hin-ay, an Albayanon word which denotes the arrangement of the abaca yarn or tupos into a zigzagging pattern ( hinan-ay ) in preparation for its actual weaving. Accordingly, the hin-ay or the pattern was the image drawn to connote the waving rivers crisscrossing from the mountains down the valley. In yet another account, the word hin-ay was purported to have been derived from the term an-hay which means gradually ascending. The original settlement which is now called San Agustin is located east of the town proper at a higher elevation, thus the gradual ascent from the lower villages to the then barrio center of San Agustin. It was in 1847 when Hin-ay was declared a barrio of Bulusan. The Gobernadorcillo of Bulusan visited Hin-ay and appointed Apolonio Capido as the first barrio lieutenant. Deeply influenced by Catholicism brought by the Spanish friars, the natives of Hin-ay constructed a makeshift chapel and dedicated it to their patron Saint Michael Archangel. As years passed, the original clearing had grown into a bustling community and eventually, the settlers requested the church authorities to bestow upon San Miguel a status independent and separate from that of Bulusan. The petition was granted and Holy Masses on Sundays and holidays of obligation were held regularly. In 1876, the Parish of San Miguel was officially recognized with Father Mariano Miranda as its parish priest and consequently, Hin-ay became known as San Miguel. On December 12, 1879, through a Royal Decree executed by the Governor General Domingo Moriones y Murillo, San Miguel was made a duly constituted pueblo or town. During those years Pedro Fruto (1881-1882), Domingo Gamba (1883-1884) and Juan Gallarda (1885-1886) were the public officials who were addressed as Capitanes del Pueblo. From the year 1880, the town of San Miguel flourished as an independent political unit under the Province of Albay when Sorsogon, until October 10, 1894, was not yet separated from its mother province. The first Guardia Civil came to Irosin in 1883. Its members were Filipinos headed by a Spanish Captain. With the spread of the underground movement called by the Spaniards hombres rebeldes in 1894, more Spanish forces called casadores were dispatched to Irosin. They imposed curfew hours in a bid to curtail the local uprisings. It was during the incumbency of Father Esteban Rivera in 1887 when the name San Miguel was again changed to Irosin. The word was derived from the local term iros which means to cut-off a part. The word was traced to have come from an old tailor‚Äôs term synonymous with tabas as in ‚Äùirosi an hiniro‚Äù or cut a part of the cloth. Iros was the image most probably drawn to connote the gush or flow of floodwaters eroding riverbanks and cutting through lands to eventually form another river or river route. The old historical tale of Elias Cuadro and Sabiniano Gacias (1937) runs thus: :Gnaning maontoc na an guibong pagtabas, :pag-iros can salog, sa banua pagrompag; :segun supersticion, encantong balignag, :maraot na pagtubod, ay sosogon nangad. :Con caya guinibo, iboniag Irosin, :gnaranan an banua, apodon nin siring; :ta sogno-sognoon an hoyog na quiling, :pag-iros can tubig nin banuang Irosin. (translation:) :Hearken what was done to stanch :the vale's ruin by the river's wrath; :of lore handed from the aged, :ah, wicked elfin, ye must be railed. :So t'was known to everyone :the name Irosin bestowed then on, :rail it was at what recurs, :bane to the vale, wrath of the rivers! Giving credence to the above account, Irosin was indeed frequently eroded due to inundations of the rivers. On the 24th of December 1933, massive flooding occurred sending many inhabitants to death. A concrete river control dike in 1937 under Mayor Felipe Santiago and Congressman Norberto Roque was constructed to keep the violent surge of the river from eroding the town‚Äôs mainland.Note: Brief historical account and poetic translation were drawn from the Irosin Town Fiesta '93 (September 20‚Äì29, 1993) Souvenir Magazine, \\"A toast to an alternative celebration!\\" - LG Ubalde Demographics Tourism Irosin has many potential tourist spots varying from natural parks, hot and cold springs, viewing areas and historical landmark. The famous tourism attractions in the municipality are the Mateo Hot and Cold Spring Resort, St. Michael Archangel Roman Catholic Hilltop Church and protected areas. The Bolos Crystal Spring and the Valley View Park where eateries, kiosks and parking spaces were set up had become a rest area for truckers and travelers plying the Maharlika Highway. Another potential tourist attraction is the Mapaso mineral hot spring famous for its purported healing qualities. Irosin is an ideal jump-off site for mountaineering and ecological trek that is becoming popular among tourists both foreign and local. The municipality is an entry and exit area to BVNP one of the remaining tropical forests and is a protected area in the Bicol Region. Mount Jormajam and Mount Mara-ot Banwa are the other alternative places for mountaineering and ecological trekking. There are also a number of tourist accommodations and facilities in Irosin. The Mateo Hot and Cold Springs Resort have conference halls, dormitories, cottages, eatery and swimming pools ideal for rest and recreation, conference and seminars. There is also the Guest World Resort and Nature Spring Resort with pools and accommodations. There are other lodging houses such as Villa Lim Condominium and Saint Michael Lodging House. Restaurants, snack bars and eateries are found along the CBD and inside the Irosin Public Market. The most common cultural activities in the municipality are the annual santacruzan, barangay fiestas and town fiesta where Paray Festival is showcased. The Paray Festival in September culminates with the street play Viva San Miguel, celebrated in honor of Saint Michael Archangel, the patron saint of Irosin. The local tourism industry has a great potential since ecological tourism is the trend worldwide and the national government intends to develop Bicol as a major hub for tourists. Given the variety of natural tourist spots in the municipality and its strategic location, Irosin can be a convergence area of foreign and domestic tourists and visitors.Irosin Tourism Education ;Primary education There are two kinds of Primary Education in Irosin. The public schools, particularly Irosin Central School and one private school the Holy Spirit Academy of Irosin ;Secondary education Irosin has many secondary educational institutions. The largest public high school is Gallanosa National High School.

Demographics Climate Attractions Though whale sharks are more associated with the town of Donsol, whale sharks can also be seen in Pilar Bay near San Antonio. Interaction with the whale sharks is regulated by the local department office. With the help of WWF, strict guidelines were developed to protect the sharks. These include limiting the number of swimmers per boat, no scuba divers and staying further than three meters away from the sharks. In practice, this rule is almost never applied. As many as 14 boats at a time may 'mob' a shark, with up to 30 or 40 swimmers following the shark on the surface. In recent years the number of male sharks have out-numbered female sharks by 20:1. The females that are seen are generally large mature adults in the 7m ~ 9m range. Increasing numbers of sharks show propellor marks on their backs. Anecdotal evidence from local fishermen suggests that prop strikes are from fishing boats in the off-season, rather than from tourist boats in the main January‚ÄìMay tourist season.

Foner was a prolific author and editor of more than 100 books. He is considered a pioneer in his extensive works on the role of radicals, blacks, and women in American labor and political history, which were generally neglected in mainstream academia at the time. A Marxist thinker, he influenced more than a generation of scholars, inspiring some of the work published by younger academics from the 1970s on. In 1941, Foner became a public figure as one among 26 persons fired from teaching and staff positions at City College of New York for political views, following an investigation of communist influence in education by a state legislative committee, known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee. Foner is best remembered for his 10-volume History of the Labor Movement in the United States, published between 1947 and 1994. He also edited the 5-volume collection The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass, and wrote a biography of the abolitionist leader. His works Organized Labor and the Black Worker, (1974 and 1982 editions) and the two-volume Women in the American Labor Movement (1979 and 1980) also broke new ground in history. For his American Labor Songs of the Nineteenth Century (1975), Foner received the Deems Taylor Award, presented by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). His scholarship, publications and political affiliations were considered to be on the far left. In 1979, the New York State Board of Higher Education formally apologized to Foner and other persons who lost their jobs as a result of the Rapp-Coudert Committee, saying it had seriously violated academic freedom. A controversy over Foner's work and scholarship practices arose in academic circles in 2003, with a discussion of plagiarism and sloppy scholarship. The New York Labor History Association had awarded Foner a lifetime achievement award in 1994. It reiterated its support in 2003 that the value of his work exceeded his shortcomings. Background Foner was born in 1910 into an Eastern European immigrant family on the Lower East Side of New York City.Lawrence Van Gelder, \\"Philip S. Foner, Labor Historian and Professor, 84.\\", New York Times, December 15, 1994, pg. B20. His parents were Jewish immigrants from the Russian empire. Foner grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and graduated from Eastern District High School. Philip Foner had three brothers, who also became important figures in the American Left, coming to adulthood during the Great Depression. His twin brother Jack D. Foner (1910‚Äì1999) became a professional historian, and was the father of historian Eric Foner. Two other brothers were leading unionists: Moe Foner was active in 1199 of the United Healthcare Workers and was particularly notable for running the union's cultural programs. Henry Foner led the Furriers' Union. Foner obtained his Bachelor's degree from the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1932, where he and his brother Jack were both students of historian Allan Nevins. He earned his Master's degree from Columbia University in 1933. In 1941 he received his Ph.D. from Columbia. Career  Foner became an instructor of history at City College of New York in 1933, the same year in which he obtained his master's degree. He taught there through 1941, when his first book was published, Business and Slavery: The New York Merchants and the Irrepressible Conflict.Herbert Shapiro, \\"Philip Sheldon Foner (b. 1910),\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First edition. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pp. 232-233. Foner was one of 26 faculty and staff members of City College who were fired from their jobs by the end of 1942 as a result of an investigation of communist influences in higher education by the New York State Legislature's Rapp-Coudert Committee. Established in spring 1940, it was officially known as the Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Educational System of the State of New York.Stephen Leberstein, \\"Purging the Profs: The Rapp Coudert Committee in New York, 1940‚Äì1942,\\" in Michael E. Brown et al. (eds.), New Studies in the Politics and Culture of U.S. Communism. New York: Monthly Review Press, c1993. 105. Foner testified at the investigative hearings in April 1941, during which he denied being a member of the Communist Party. The next month he was brought up on charges by the Board of Higher Education's Conduct Committee. In August the Board held a trial in his case on charges that he belonged to the Communist Party, had participated in such related activities as the publication of The Teacher-Worker, a newsletter of a Communist Party unit active at City College; and had given false testimony at his hearing. The trial committee made a report recommending his dismissal in November 1941.The trial transcript and other trial documents are held in the Records of the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York; RG 1368; YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York, N.Y. Foner's three brothers: his twin Jack, a professor of history at CCNY; Moe, a worker in the CCNY registrar's office; and Henry, a substitute teacher in the New York City public schools, were also caught up in the investigation. They were fired from their jobs as well. After his dismissal from City College, Foner became a principal and chief editor for Citadel Press, based in New York City. This was his primary means of survival during the years of being blacklisted. In 1947, the first volume of what would become Foner's magnum opus, A History of the Labor Movement of the United States, was released by International Publishers, a publisher considered close to the Communist Party USA. Writing as a Marxist, Foner emphasized the role of the working class and their allies in a class struggle dating to the earliest days of the American republic. One historian described his work as presenting \\"a formidable challenge to the orthodox John R. Commons interpretation of labor history.\\" This school of thought at the University of Wisconsin considered unionized workers to be improving their position in American capitalism. By contrast, according to historian Nelson Lichtenstein, Foner believed that \\"unions were part of a broader movement for democratization -- a means of struggling for political and social goals such as equality and power, as well as better wages, hours, and working conditions.\\" He published nine more volumes in this history during his life, with the last, ending at the eve of the Great Depression, published shortly before his death. In 1949, Foner published the first volume of his multi- volume work, The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass, also produced by International Publishers in New York City. The work totaled five volumes, being published between 1949 and 1952. His nephew Eric Foner, known for his own work on the Reconstruction era, said that Douglass had been largely forgotten as an important abolitionist and African-American leader when his uncle started publishing his writings. In 1967, the power of the blacklist finally waned. Philip Foner was hired as a history professor at Lincoln University, a historically black university located near Oxford, Pennsylvania. Foner served here until his retirement in 1979. Following his retirement, Foner continued to publish books. He usually worked as a co-author and editor of document collections in association with a younger scholar. An historian of a later generation described his style as amassing primary documents, in the manner of some 19th-century historians. In 1979, nearly three decades after the mass firings at City College, the New York State Board of Higher Education formally apologized to Foner and persons attacked by the Rapp-Coudert Committee, whose lives had been disrupted by firings, political fears and rumors. The Board described the conduct of the Rapp-Coudert Committee as \\"an egregious violation of academic freedom.\\"\\"Jack D. Foner\\", Perspectives, American Historical Society, April 2000. Foner became a professor of history at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey in 1981. Following his wife Roslyn's death, Foner married again in 1988. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1991.  Criticism  Foner's work was politically controversial in a period of American fears about immigrant anarchists, labor unrest, and the power of the Soviet Union and Communist Party. Some historians have also criticized his work on scholarly grounds. In 1971, writing in Labor History journal, historian James O. Morris documented that Foner had plagiarized material from Morris' 1950s unpublished master's thesis in his 1965 book, The Case of Joe Hill.Labor History, vol. 12, no. 1 (Winter 1971), pp. 81-114. Morris wrote that \\"About one quarter of the Foner text is a verbatim or nearly verbatim reproduction\\" of his manuscript, and had other complaints. Scholars such as labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein acknowledge that Foner's shortcomings were recognized in the 1970s and 1980s, but supporters believe that he still made substantial contributions to the field. In May 2003, complaints about Foner were discussed among labor historians on H-Labor and in postings at the History News Network, with accusations of plagiarism and sloppy scholarship. Scott McLemee reviewed the controversy in an article in Chronicle of Higher Education and noted that old political debates were being re-opened.Scott McLemee, \\"Seeing Red\\", Chronicle of Higher Education vol. 49, no. 42 (June 27, 2003), pg. A11. Many academics, intellectuals and artists had suffered suppression during the McCarthy era. Foner's nephew Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University said that \\"his uncle's radical politics are the crux of the recent debate. 'Obviously, any charge of plagiarism needs to be taken seriously,' he says. 'But I think that this controversy is being muddied up with powerful ideological issues that ought to be kept quite separate'.\\" In May 2003, labor historian Mel Dubofsky accused Philip Foner of having \\"borrowed wholesale from my then unpublished dissertation\\" on the Industrial Workers of the World for use in Volume 4 of his History of the Labor Movement in the United States.Melvyn Dubofsky in \\"Was Foner Guilty of Plagiarism?\\" History News Network, George Mason University, June 2, 2003. Retrieved May 31, 2010. Dubofsky said that Foner extracted large chunks of this dissertation \\"without attribution or inverted commas.\\" Dubofsky alleged that Foner had similarly used unpublished work of other young scholars \\"too numerous to mention.\\" But Dubofsky also noted that many young labor historians in the 1970s felt that Foner had suffered enough in being blacklisted and were reluctant to take any official action against him. He said, \\"So even the people whose work he had borrowed from freely did not want to say anything.\\" Historian John Earl Haynes, who has used Soviet archives for his multi-volume work on the American Communist Party, said there had long been criticisms of Foner for plagiarism, but said he was a \\"hero to radical historians.\\" In a posting on the History News Network, Haynes said that Foner had inaccurately footnoted references to some of Haynes' work.John Earl Haynes in \\"Was Foner Guilty of Plagiarism?\\" History News Network, George Mason University, June 2, 2003. Retrieved May 31, 2010. Eric Foner added another perspective to his uncle's work: > He edited the writings of Frederick Douglass at a time when, believe it or > not, nobody remembered him. He edited seven volumes of documents on the > history of black labor in the United States, and collections of material > from black political conventions in the 19th century. And he did all of it > without research assistants or grants. This debate is not doing justice to > his contributions to scholarship. In recognition of the value of the historian's body of work, the president of the New York Labor History Association said it had no plans to revoke the lifetime-achievement award it gave to Foner in 1994. Personal life and death  Foner married Roslyn Held in 1939. The pair had two daughters, Elizabeth and Laura. Philip S. Foner died age 83 on December 13, 1994, the day before his 84th birthday.

He was the chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries from 1982 to 1987. He was best known by the public for his BBC television show, Troubleshooter, in which he advised struggling businesses. Early life John Henry Harvey-Jones was born in Hackney, London, but spent most of his early childhood in Dhar, India, where his father, Mervyn Stockton Harvey-Jones (n√© Harvey), a former Captain in the Indian Army and bank employee, was guardian and tutor to a teenage maharajah. He was shipped back to Britain at age six to attend a prep school at Deal, Kent. He entered Dartmouth Royal Naval College at age 13. Royal Navy career Harvey-Jones joined Dartmouth Royal Naval College as a cadet in 1937, and in 1940, at the age of 16, he joined HMS Diomede as a midshipman. The next two ships that he served with, HMS Ithuriel and HMS Quentin, were sunk by enemy action. Harvey-Jones went on to join the submarine service in 1942, and received his first command at age 24. With the end of World War II, Harvey-Jones went to the University of Cambridge to learn Russian in six months and joined Naval Intelligence as an interpreter. He married Mary Bignell in 1947, and he commanded the Russian intelligence section under the guise of the \\"British Baltic Fishery Protection Service\\", which used two ex-German E-boats for gathering clandestine intelligence on the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Rising to the rank of lieutenant-commander, Harvey-Jones was awarded a military MBE in 1952 for his work in Naval Intelligence, although his citation stated that the award was for \\"fishery protection duties in the Baltic\\". Commercial career =Imperial Chemical Industries= Refused permission by the Royal Navy to spend more time with his wife and daughter Gaby, who had contracted polio, he resigned his commission in 1956 and joined Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) on Teesside as a junior training manager. In 1973, at age 49, he was promoted to sit on the main board of directors. In April 1982, he became chairman of ICI, only the second split- career man and non-chemist to reach the top. Mentored in part by John Adair, Harvey-Jones saw his responsibilities to both stockholders and employees as \\"making a profit out of the markets where the market is\\". He maintained a firm belief in \\"speed rather than direction\\", on the assumption that \\"once travelling a company can veer and tack towards the ultimate objective.\\" Thus, at the business level he cut non-profit making and what he saw as non-core businesses, so that at board level he could concentrate on putting more power in fewer hands \\"to reduce the number of those who can say 'no' and increase the motivation of those who can say 'yes'\\", maintaining that \\"there are no bad troops, only bad leaders\\". After only 30 months in the job, having cut the UK workforce by one third, he had doubled the price of ICI shares and turned a loss into a one-billion-pound profit. =Media career= According to one newspaper, it was the BBC's Troubleshooter series, first broadcast in 1990, that made Harvey-Jones the most famous industrialist since Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It ran to five series and several specials in the 1990s and also won him a BAFTA award. His advice was at times controversial‚Äîin particular he was critical of the Morgan Motor Company, which some argue was vindicated, as it is still trading successfully today. =Other positions= In 1989, he became chairman of The Economist, was a non-executive director of Grand Metropolitan plc (now part of Diageo), and honorary vice-president of the Institute of Marketing. Harvey-Jones was also chairman of the Burns-Anderson Group plc, a conglomerate spanning merchant banking, financial services, recruitment, marketing and business services, and stockbroking. Between 1986 and 1991, Harvey-Jones served as the second Chancellor of the University of Bradford. A commemorative painting exists in the University of Bradford collection,University of Bradford portraits at Cornucopia and Harvey-Jones also agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar for a terracotta portrait at Clyro in July 2004.Picture of bust at Jon Edgar web site He was chairman of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and member of the Advisory Council of the Prince's Trust. In 2001, he became the president of the MS Trust. Personal life Described by The Guardian as one of the best-known British advocates of Transcendental Meditation, Harvey-Jones said, \\"I don't make a drama out of a crisis. If I gave it up now, my wife would leave me.\\" Having lived most of his post-retirement period in Ross-on-Wye, he died in his sleep after a long illness, aged 83, at the Hereford County Hospital.

Life Walfrid was born of John Kerins and Elizabeth Flynn in Ballymote, a village in south County Sligo in Connacht in the west of Ireland. His ancestors, the √ì C√©ir√≠n (later anglicised as \\"Kerins\\"), were anciently Gaelic lords of Ciarraige Locha na n√Åirne, with a long history in County Mayo. He studied teaching and in 1864 joined The Marist Brothers Teaching Order. He moved to Scotland in the 1870s and taught at St. Marys School and the Sacred Heart School where he was appointed headmaster in 1874. He also helped found St. Joseph's College, Dumfries. In 1888, he founded The Celtic Football Club as a means of raising funds for the catholic poor and deprived in the east end of Glasgow. In 1893 Walfrid was sent by his religious order to London's East End. Here he continued his work, organizing football matches for and showing great kindness to the barefoot catholic children in the districts of Bethnal Green and Bow. The charity established by Walfrid was named The Poor Children's Dinner Table. He died on 17 April 1915, leaving a surviving brother, Bernard, in Cloghboley, County Sligo. Walfrid is buried in the Mount St. Michael Cemetery in Dumfries.  Commemoration  A commemorative sculpture of Walfrid was erected outside Celtic Park on 5 November 2005. Brother Walfrid sculpture at Celtic Park The sculpture by Kate Robinson was cast in bronze and its pedestal carved from granite.

I‚Äôve travelled half a million miles in my years here... It‚Äôs time to go , The Herald, 29 September 2007. The veil for the unveiling ceremony was made by workshops in fourteen schools and community centres throughout Glasgow. Funded by Sense Over Sectarianism, artists worked with young people to create images of footballers and football strips which were digitally printed onto the veil itself. The unveiling was performed by former assistant manager and player Sean Fallon, himself a native of Sligo. The ceremony was attended by the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Mario Conti who blessed the statue, several thousand fans and former Celtic and Rangers captains and managers Billy McNeil and John Greig. New music for the ceremony called Walfrid at the Gates of Paradise was composed by relative James MacMillan. Archbishop Conti presented club officials with a Celtic cross from the church where Celtic were established, Saint Mary's, Calton the second oldest church in the Archdiocese of Glasgow. After the ceremony, the Celtic Charity Fund presented a cheque of ‚Ç§5,000 for St Mary's, to help the restoration fund for the church and to recognise the important link between club and community.

He established David Chipperfield Architects in 1985. His major works include the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire (1989‚Äì1998); the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany; the Des Moines Public Library, Iowa (2002‚Äì2006); the Neues Museum, Berlin (1997‚Äì2009); The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in Wakefield, UK (2003‚Äì2011), the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri (2005‚Äì2013); and the Museo Jumex in Mexico City (2009‚Äì2013). Rowan Moore, the architecture critic of the Guardian of London, described his work as serious, solid, not flamboyant or radical, but comfortable with the history and culture of its setting. \\"He deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and in art.\\" \\"A Master of Permanence Comes Home\\", The Guardian\\" David Chipperfield Architects is a global architectural practice with offices in London, Berlin, Milan, and Shanghai. Career Chipperfield was born in London in 1953, and graduated in 1976 from Kingston School of Art in London. He studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, receiving his diploma in architecture in 1977. He worked in the offices of several notable architects, including Douglas Stephen, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, before founding his own firm, David Chipperfield Architects, in 1985.ed.Thomas Weaver, 'David Chipperfield, Architectural Works 1990‚Äì2002'(Ediciones Poligrafa, Barcelona, 2003) p.326 As a young architect Chipperfield championed the historically-attuned, place-specific work of continental architects such as Moneo, Snozzi and Siza through the 9H Gallery situated in the front room of his London office.Interview: David Chipperfield, 'Architecture Today' 14 February 2011 He first established his reputation designing store interiors in London, Paris, Tokyo and New York. Among Chipperfield's early projects in England was a shop for Issey Miyake on London's Sloane Street.Jonathan Glancey (7 October 2010), David Chipperfield wins Royal Gold Medal for architecture The Guardian. His shops in Japan led to commissions to design for a private museum in the Chiba prefecture (1987), design for a store for the automobile company Toyota in Kyoto (1989), and the headquarters of the Matsumoto Company in Okayama (1990). His firm opened an office in Tokyo in 1989. He first commission to design an actual building was for a house for the fashion photographer Nick Knight in London in 1990. His first completed projects in London were the gallery of botany and the entrance hall for the Museum of Natural History (1993), and restaurant Wagamama, both in London. His first major project in Britain was the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames (1989) (see below). He also began to build in Germany, designing an office building in D√ºsseldorf (1994‚Äì1997). Other projects in the 1990s included the Circus Restaurant in London (1997) and the Joseph Menswear Shop (1997). The latter shop featured a curtain of glass six meters high around the two lower floors, and an austere modernist interior with dark gray sandstone floors and white walls. In 1997 he began one of his most important projects, the reconstruction and restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been largely destroyed during World War II. After 2000, he won commissions for several other major museum projects in Germany, designed several major museum projects in Germany, including the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach (2002‚Äì2006), and the Galerie Am Kupfergraben 10 in Berlin (2003‚Äì2007). In the same period he designed and built, at rapid speed, a new headquarters for the America's Cup in Valencia, Spain (2005‚Äì2006), and an enormous judicial complex in Barcelona, Spain, which consolidated the offices previously contained in seventeen different buildings into nine new immense concrete blocks. He also constructed his first project in the United States, an extension of the Museum of ethnology and natural history in Anchorage, Alaska (2003‚Äì2009). Until 2011 most of his major projects were on the continent of Europe, but lin 2011 he opened two notable museum projects in Britain, the Turner Contemporary (2006‚Äì11) in Margate, and The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield. In 2013 he opened the Jumex Museum in Mexico City, and the extension of the Saint Louis Art Museum in the United States. His most remote project was the Museum of Naga, on a site in the desert 170 kilometers northeast of Khartoum in Sudan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He designed a structure to preserve the remains of two ancient temples and an artesian well, dating to 300 B.C.-300 A.D. The building, built of the local stone, blends into reddish mountains around it. In 2015, Chipperfield won a competition to redesign the modern and contemporary art wing of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. He also began his first ground-up building in New York City, the Bryant, a thirty- three story hotel and condominium project next to Bryant Park in Manhattan. In 2017 he and his associates were engaged in a multitude of major projects around the world; including new flagship stores for Bally and Valentino, the reconstruction of the U.S, Embassy in London; One Pancras Square, an office and commercial complex behind King's Cross Station in London.a project for the Shanghai Expo tower in China, the new Nobel Center headquarters for the Nobel Prize in Stockholm, a headquarters store for the online firm SSENSE in Montreal, the Kuntshaus cultural center in Zurich, the Haus der Kunst cultural center in Munich, the completion of the headquarters of Amorepacific in Seoul, Korea, and the Inagara Reien Project, a temple complex in Japan'Renovation Haus Der Kunst, 'Architects24' Kunsthaus Zurich Extension, 'Dezeen' Sept 28 2009 Major projects (1997-2010)  File:River-Rowing-Museum- Henley.jpgRiver and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK, (1989-1997) File:Central Branch, Des Moines Public Library.jpgDes Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa (2002-2006) File:MarbachLiteraturmuseumModerne.jpgMuseum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany (2002-2006) File:Veles e Vents.jpgAmerica's Cup Building, Valencia, Spain, (2005-2006) File:Grand escalier du Hall du Neues Museum (Berlin) (6098967815).jpgNeues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997-2009) =River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK (1989‚Äì1997)= The River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames is devoted particularly to the sports of rowing; the town hosted is home to the Annual Royal Regatta Olympic boating events in 1908 and 1948. The building is a blend of modernist and traditional forms and materials. It was inspired by the form of traditional boat sheds, as well as the traditional barns of Oxfordshire. The building occupies a space of 2300 square meters, and is lifted above the ground on concrete pillars to avoid flooding. The exterior and parts of the interior are covered in planks of non-treated oak, matching the local rural architecture. The roofs and sunscreens are of stainless steel,The entrance has glass walls, and the galleries on the ground floor receive natural light through roof.Ivor Richards, '1997 January: River and Rowing Museum by David Chipperfield (Henley, UK)' in 'The Architectural Review', 23 February 2011 =Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa (2002‚Äì2006) = The Des Moines Public Library in Des Moines, Iowa, covers an area of 110,000 square feet, and cost 32.3 million dollars to construct. The two-story building has no front or back; instead it fans out into three wings. a glass tunnel allows passers-by to stroll through the library. Its most distinct feature is an exterior of glass panels with cooper mesh sandwiched between them; the mesh blocks eighty percent of the sunlight, while allowing library patrons to gaze out at the park around the library. Chipperfield told Christopher Hall of the New York Times: \\"The architecture is neutral and amorphous; almost no architecture at all, and the copper mesh is an attempt to veil the building as much as possible while allowing the outside in.\\"New York Times, July 30, 2005 =Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach, Germany (2002‚Äì2006)= The Museum of Modern Literature is located in the town of Marbach, Germany, the birthplace of the poet Schiller. and benefits from a panoramic view of the Neckar River. It is located next to the beaux-arts building of the national Schiller Museum, built in 1903, and a more modern building of the German Literary Archives, from the 1970s. Visitors enter through a pavilion on the top floor and descend to the reading rooms below. While the lighting on the interior is entirely artificial, to protect the manuscripts, each level has a terrace overlooking the countryside. The facades of concrete, glass and wood are designed to give the impression of both solidity and modernity. The building was awarded the Stirling Prize in 2007. =America's Cup Building (Veles e Vents), Valencia, Spain (2005‚Äì06)= Chipperfield won a 2005 competition and construct a new headquarters for the America's Cup on the coast in Valencia, Spain. It was completed in just eleven months. The distinctive features of the 10,000 square meter building are three horizontal levels which overhang the terrace below by as much as fifteen meters, providing shade and an unobstructed view of the sea. The predominant color inside and out is white, with panels of white metal on the ceilings, floors of white resin, and exterior trim of white-painted stainless steel. Exterior accents are provided by planks of wood. =The Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997‚Äì2009)= In 1997 Chipperfield, along with Julian Harrap, won a competition for the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been severely damaged during World War II. His commission was to recreate the original volume of the museum, both by restoring original spaces and adding new spaces which would respect the historic structure of the building. Reinforced concrete was used for new galleries and the new central staircase, while recycled bricks were used in other spaces, particularly in the north wing and the south dome. In addition, some of the scars of the war on the buildings walls were preserved, as an essential part of its history. As Chipperfield explained, the architects used these materials so that \\"The new would reflect that which was lost, without imitating it.\\" The building received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2011. In 2007 Chipperfield began a new project with the museum, to construct a new gallery, the James Simon Gallery, inspired on the colonnade of the old museum. The new section will house more than ten thousand objects from the archeological collections, including the famed bust of Queen Nefertiti.

It is composed of ten trapezoidal blocks; its upper-level galleries are lit by natural light from large windows in the pitched roofs. Its windows have views of the river, historic waterfront and the city skyline. The building's fa√ßade is clad with self-compacting pigmented concrete made on site, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The architects selected the material to emphasise the gallery's sculptural appearance. =City of Justice complex, Barcelona, Spain (2002‚Äì2011)= The City of Justice is a group of nine buildings with 241,500 meters of space, which consolidate courtrooms and offices which previously were scattered among seventeen different buildings. The courtrooms are on the ground floor, with offices above. Four of the buildings are connected together by a four-story hallway. in addition to the judicial buildings, the complex, on the outskirts of Barcelona, includes a commercial center and retail stores, and a block of low income residential housing. The facades of the buildings are all the same, made of concrete poured in place and lightly tinted in different shades. Chipperfield wrote that the purpose of the building was to \\"break the image of justice as rigid and monolithic\\", but architectural critic Rowan Moore of the Guardian said it appeared \\"uncomfortably prison-like.\\"Rowan Moore 'A Master of Permanance Comes Home', The Guardian, 5 February 2011 =Saint Louis Art Museum expansion (2005‚Äì2013)= The Saint Louis Art Museum project in Saint Louis, Missouri (2005‚Äì2013) involved building a major new wing attached to a landmark of American architecture, the gallery built by beaux-arts architect Cass Gilbert in 1904. The new building by Chipperfield, with 9000 square meters of space, harmonizes smoothly with the classic building; its ground level is the same as that of the main floor of the Gilbert Building. The walls are dark concrete were poured and polished in place, and the roof of concrete caissons is designed to modify the light entering the galleries. To give the facade a distinctive look which also blended with the Gilbert building, Chipperfield speckled the dark gray polished concrete walls with fragments of the same kind of sandstone used in the Gilbert building. Edwin Heathcote of the Financial Times called it \\"a gem of clarity and deceptive simplicity...It is a building designed to glow, inside and out, one that is more about the intangibility of light than about mass reinforced by shadow.\\"Review by Edwin Heathcote, The Financial Times', July 3, 2013 =Turner Contemporary gallery, Margate, UK (2006‚Äì2013)= The Turner Contemporary gallery is located beside a beach in Margate, to the north of Kent in the south of England. It is devoted to the works of J.M.W. Turner and his contemporaries, and those he influenced, and is close to the historic rooming house where the artist stayed. The museum is composed of six identical glass galleries, called \\"Cristalins\\", which are interconnected. The sunlight from the south is softened by a system of shutters over the ceiling, and the buildings are raised on pylons to avoid flooding from the neighboring sea. The fritted facades are designed to resist the dampness, corrosion and winds coming from the sea. =Colecci√≥n Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009‚Äì2013)= The Colecci√≥n Jumex in Mexico City displays one of the largest private collections of contemporary art in Mexico, neighboring a theater and another museum in a modern neighborhood of the city. Zoning restrictions limited the space available, so Chipperfield put the museum administration, shop, and library in existing adjoining buildings, and devoted the Museum almost entirely to exhibit space. The galleries on the upper levels receive natural light from the skylights on the roof facing toward the west. The buiidling is supported on fourteen columns, and is built of concrete covered with plaques of travertine limestone from Xalapa, in Veracruz province. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the lower floors have frames of stainless steel. Style and philosophy Chipperfield's buildings cannot be described as following one particular style, although his work is sometimes seen as a reaction against the more flamboyant projects of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or Santiago Calatrava. In 2005, he told Christopher Hall of the New York Times, \\"I'm very interested in doing buildings that people are fond of, but with each project I also try to push the boundaries, to make something familiar but different. I'm not so interested in convincing the architectural community that I'm a genius.\\"New York Times, \\"A Briton's View Takes Hold in the Heartland\\", interview with Christopher Hall, July 30, 2005 In a 2014 interview with Andy Butler in Designboom , Chipperfield declared: \\"The one thing you can't do in architecture, at least in my opinion, is to limit your way of thinking to a style, or a material, you have to be responsive to the circumstances of a project.\\" He declared that \\"architecture could not be globalized\\", because it varied depending upon the culture of a city. \\"However contemporary we feel that we are, we still want to find different characteristics in different places. When we are building in a city we have a responsibility in a way to join in and to understand why buildings are as they are in that city. I find it very weak for an architect to disregard the history and culture of a city and say \\"I have an international style.\\" There's absolutely no justification for that. It's the equivalent of having no variation in a cuisine, you may as well just place all the different types of food in a blender and consume it as a protein-rich shake.\\"Interview with Andy Butler, Designboom, April 30, 2014 Architecture critic Rowan Moore observed that \\"Chipperfield stresses less glamorous questions, such as, \\"how is a building going to look five or ten years later?\\" He quotes Chipperfiield on his work on the Neues Museum, a project which lasted twelve years. \\"How you do things is profoundly important. the quality of the Neues museum construction is extraordinary even by German standards, and people can smell the quality. The concept would not have been so convincing without it.\\" Chipperfield described the style of his recent The Bryant residential tower in New York City (2013‚Äì2018) as \\"classical elegance in terms of its symmetries and simple grids and order.\\" Describing the Bryant Park, Tim McKeough of the New York Times wrote \\"In contrast with other big-name architects who wow with audacious forms and breathtaking structural feats, Mr. Chipperfield is best- known for buildings with a pared-down aesthetic purity.\\" He noted that Chipperfield's signature on the building was the facade, composed of precast terrazzo panels with a mosaic of marble and sandstone chips, polished to a matte finish, to give the building a distinctive reflective color.The New York Times, September 18, 2015 Criticism Rowan Moore of The Guardian reviewed the body of Chipperfield's work in a 2011 article. He was critical of some buildings, such as the Hepworth Gallery, which he suggested resembled \\"a bunker\\", and the law courts in Barcelona, which he said were \\"uncomfortably prison-like, as if defendants were guilty until proven innocent,\\" but he also found much to admire in Chipperfield's work: \\"He is much sought after for projects that help define cities' modern view of themselves, often in relation to a rich or fraught history. He deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and art. He likes \\"permanence\\", \\"substance\\", and \\"meaning\\", and dislikes designs that are spectacular for the hell of it...His buildings have a strong presence, with right angles and straight lines prominent. He likes solid masonry and concrete, where you seed that stuff that is holding the building up, and sense its mass. He adheres, arguably too much, to the classical idea that architecture is about naked materials and structures seen in daylight. Mobility, surface, illusion, or the way artificial lighting forms cities at night, is less important to him...He likes the appearance and reality of permanence, and is skeptical about architect's common feeling that buildings can be as light and transient as airplanes or tents.\\" He cites Chipperfield: \\"'You always have to dig a hole in the ground and pour a lot of concrete into it.'\\" Moore wrote: \\"What all these projects have in common is the desire to bring out the best in the thing that Chipperfield finds in the brief or site ‚Äì the ruins in Berlin, the light in Margate, the art in Wakefield.\\" Teaching Chipperfield has taught architecture in Europe and the United States, and has lectured extensively, including as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1995 to 2001.The Board appoints new Directors: David Chipperfield for Architecture and Alberto Barbera for Cinema La Biennale di Venezia, 27 December 2011.

In medicine, it is usually defined as the recurrence of symptoms after a period of remission or quiescence, in which sense it can sometimes be synonymous with relapse. In a narrower sense it can also be such a recurrence with higher severity than before the remission. In infectious diseases, recrudescence is the return of detectable symptoms in a patient whose blood stream infection has previously been at such a low level as not to be clinically demonstrable or cause symptoms. For example, the Plasmodium parasites, which are responsible for malaria, can persist in the blood without causing apparent symptoms for a few months, but recrudescence easily occurs, mainly due to challenges that tax the immune system. This is an example of where the term recrudescence is reserved for a separate meaning from relapse, as relapse in this context occurs due to an awakening of the parasite from its dormant form (hypnozoite) in the liver. The bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bovine virus diarrhea) is said to be recrudescent for some time after clinical signs have abated, because antibodies plateau c. weeks 10‚Äì12, and are not lifelong, auto infection may potentially occur in the acutely infected non-pregnant animal.

Moody fought racism and segregation from when she was a little girl ..in Centreville, Mississippi, and continued throughout her adult life around the American South. Life Moody, n√©e Essie Mae Moody on September 15, 1940, was the oldest of eight children. After her parents split up when she was five or six years old, she grew up with her mother, Elmira aka Toosweet, in Centreville, Mississippi, while her father, Diddly, lived with his new wife, Emma, in nearby Woodville. At a young age Moody began working for white families in the area, cleaning their houses and helping their children with homework for only a few dollars a week, while earning perfect grades in school and helping at Mount Pleasant church. After graduating with honors from a segregated, all-black high school, she attended Natchez Junior College (also all black) in 1961 on a basketball scholarship. Moody then moved on to Tougaloo College on an academic scholarship, to earn a bachelor's degree. She became involved with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). After graduation, Moody became a full-time worker in the civil rights movement, participating in a variety of different protests such as marches and a sit-ins. Moody participated in a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Jackson, when a mob attacked her, fellow student Joan Trumpauer, and Tougaloo professor John Salter, Jr., joined her. The mob continuously poured flour, salt, sugar, and mustard on them, as depicted in a Jackson Daily News photograph. Two weeks after the sit-in, the Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated outside his family home in Jackson. She was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi for attempting to protest inside of a post office with 13 other protesters, including Joan Trumpauer, Doris Erskine, Jeanette King, and Lois Chaffee. In the 1960s, Anne Moody went underground. In other words, she moved to New York and lived quietly for decades. She enforced that she would be a part of no interviews during this time. It was in New York, where Anne Moody wrote \\"Coming of Age in Mississippi.\\" During her quiet time she worked a number of non-writing jobs. Anne Moody wrote her second book, \\"Mr. Death,\\" in 1975. \\"Mr. Death\\" was filled with short stories aimed at younger people to teach them the theme of mortality. During Freedom Summer (1964), Moody worked for CORE in the town of Canton, Mississippi. In 1967, she married Austin Straus, a white man who was an NYU graduate student. In 1971, she gave birth to her son Sasha Strauss. In 1972, her family moved to Berlin after receiving a full-time scholarship, and they remained there until 1974 when they returned to America. Upon her return, she wrote a sequel to her autobiography, entitled Farewell to Too Sweet, which covered her life from 1974 to 1984, and in a 1985 interview with Debra Spencer she spoke of writing other books of memoirs, AU 76 OHP 403. all of which remain unpublished. Moody was also involved in the anti-nuclear movement. She resettled in Mississippi in the early 1990s, though never felt at ease there, according to her sister Adline Moody. Death On February 5, 2015, Moody died at her home in Gloster, Mississippi at the age of 74, under the care of her younger sister Adline Moody, having suffered from dementia in recent years. Autobiography Moody's autobiography, Coming of Age in Mississippi (1968), is acclaimed for its realistic portrayal of life for a young African American before and during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Her perspective of life in rural Mississippi is unique but not abnormal. Moody grew up in a household where her mother would suppress any idea of questioning the way things were or the concept of segregation. The book has been published in seven languages and sold around the world. Moody's autobiography opens onto her early life on a plantation with her mother, Toosweet, her father, Diddly, and her younger sister, Adline. At the time, she was called Essie Mae. Her uncle, George Lee, who was eight years old at the time, would watch over five-year-old Essie Mae and one-year-old Adline while their parents went to work. George Lee would neglect and abuse the girls. He was eventually dismissed from his babysitting duties after he started a fire in Essie Mae's family's two-bedroom shack. Essie's parents' relationship began to unravel after Diddly's friend, Bush, died and Diddly began seeing a lot more of Bush's wife, Florence. He began having an affair while Essie's mother was pregnant with their 3rd child, Junior. Toosweet eventually left Diddly, taking her children with her, and moved in with their Aunt Cindy. They stayed with her until Essie Mae's mother found a better job and moved them into a new home. Later on, Essie's mother had her fourth child, James, with a soldier named Raymond. The soldier and Miss Pearl, the soldier's mother, took the baby in because Toosweet was unable to afford to take care of four children at the time. Essie and her family continued to visit James while Raymond was in town, but they stopped visiting when he got called to service due to the cold treatment that Toosweet received from Miss Pearl. In chapter three, Essie began to notice how all of the white people she encountered had nicer homes, better food, and more privileges in general than the average black person. Essie had received her first job working for an old white lady named Mrs. Carter. She swept her porch for 75 cents and some milk. Shortly after, Essie started working for Mrs. Claiborne who paid her three dollars a week. Essie enjoyed working for Mrs. Claiborne, because this woman taught her new things and allowed Essie to eat dinner with her family. Essie's mother later gets pregnant with her fifth baby, which is also her second child with Raymond. Due to this news Raymond begins building a house for Essie and her family. Essie, and her mother, began choosing furniture for their newly built house. Essie began playing for the basketball team at her school, she was the tallest on the team. So, consequently, the coach paid close attention to Essie. However, when the time came to play in her first basketball game, Essie froze, and her teammates laughed at her; she later quit. While living in her newly built house, built close to Miss Pearl's home, Essie noticed her mother had a difficult time being accepted into Raymond's family. Her Aunt Caroline later moved closer to the family, so her mother, Toosweet, would have someone to talk to. Essie's mother gave birth to her fifth child, they named her Virginia after Mrs. Johnson; however, she was called Jennie Ann. In an attempt to be accepted into Raymond's family, Toosweet took herself and her children to Centreville Baptist Church, which was the church Raymond and his family went to. Toosweet went once, but stopped due to no progress in her relationship with Raymond's family, but Essie and her siblings kept going. Essie was later manipulated by her mother into going to their old church, Mount Pleasant. Essie was then baptized, even though she didn't want to be baptized at Mount Pleasant, due to her mother's manipulation. In the 2nd winter Essie's family spent at their newly built home; Raymond decided he wanted to become a big- time farmer. In early March, Raymond went and bought a piece of land, as well as a mule, and began plowing the land and later planting cotton. Raymond got Essie and all of the other children to pick his cotton. Eventually, Essie had passed out from the intense heat and had to take a break from the hard labor. In chapter seven, Essie started school again. Her and her family began picking pecans at Mr. Wheelers to get money for new school clothes. Shortly after, Essie found work at Miss Minnie's picking pecans and sweeping her floors. After pecan season ended, she began working for Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. The Jenkins just had their second child named Johnny. Toosweet finally married Raymond, without his mother's approval, nor her consent. Shortly after their marriage, Raymond and Toosweet had their third child together, Raymond Jr., but they called him Jerry. Essie Mae won a contest at school and was crowned homecoming queen. At the time she didn't have much money and did not want the hand-me-down gown that her employer, Mrs. Jenkins, offered her at the time. In her last effort, she wrote to her father. She met with her father for the first time in many years and was given a beautiful dress for the parade. It was in chapter nine where Essie discovered her legal name. Essie received her birth certificate in the mail, which had the wrong name. The name that was on the certificate was Anne Moody. After a great deal of convincing, Toosweet allowed her to change her name, although Toosweet wasn't entirely on board. Anne and her rival in class, Darlene, always fought to have the better grade. One day, their teacher went over everyone's final grade, Darlene and Anne were on the edge of their seats; waiting to see who had the best grade. However, they both fell short. Betty Posey, a classmate, received a better grade than the two girls. Due to Anne's employers having their second child, they built a home further away and moved there shortly after. Anne found a job working for Mrs. Jenkins mother, Mrs. Burke, whom she didn't like. Anne took up this job, regardless of how much she disliked Mrs. Jenkins mother, because Toosweet had her fourth child with Raymond, and the baby was named Ralph. With another mouth to feed and Raymond being unemployed, Annie felt obligated to do her part. Chapter ten was all in regard to Emmett Till's murder. Toosweet demanded that Anne act as if she didn't know a thing of Emmett Till's murder. When Anne would ask her mother about the boy's death, her mother refused to tell her. No one would explain to Anne about the murder of this dear boy. Until she asked her teacher, Mrs. Rice. Mrs. Rice explained a lot to Anne, not only about Emmett Till, but also about the NAACP. She was later fired, and Anne had no explanation as to why. Since the Emmett Till murder, strange things began to happen near Anne's hometown. Anne's classmate was beaten, and an entire family was burned to death. Anne desperately needed to get away from it all, and so she left for the summer. She quit working for Mrs. Burke and moved in with her uncle Ed for the summer. Anne's first job for the summer was housekeeping for a poor white family. Later, the family left unexpectedly and didn't pay her for any of her work that week. A friend of Anne's got her a job at a Caf√©, that Anne received by lying and saying she was over the age of 18 and out of school. However, when her employer discovered these lies, she was fired. Once Anne returned home, she took on many hobbies to distract her from everything. Once Anne was back home, she began working for Mrs. Burke again, where she grew intimately interested in her son, Wayne. Anne tutored Wayne and his friends for extra cash. One evening, Mrs. Burke accused Junior, Anne's brother, of stealing and shook him down. Anne later quit and began working for Mrs. Hunt, whom she worked for until she moved into her aunt's house in New Orleans for the summer. Once at her aunts, Anne tried looking for a waitress job for about a month, but as much as she tried, she came up short. Anne reluctantly began working at a chicken factory for about a month. Anne's aunt called the work slave work. Black people protested outside of the factory each day she worked there. Anne later found a job substituting for a dishwasher at a restaurant. She stayed working there and worked herself up to a bus girl, and later became a waitress. In chapter 16, Toosweet's husband and Anne's stepfather, Raymond began eyeing her. Once Anne recognized this for what it was, she moved in with her father and her stepmother, Emma. While living under her father's roof, one-night Emma's sister, Janie, was fighting with her husband, Wilbert, who was armed with a gun. In the process of protecting Janie, Emma's foot was almost shot clean off. Emma began acting differently once home out of the hospital, due to becoming handicapped. Later in this chapter Anne finally graduated high school and planned to move back to New Orleans and get back her restaurant job. Post-1968 In 1969, Coming of Age in Mississippi received the Brotherhood Award from the National Council of Christians and Jews, and the Best Book of the Year Award from the National Library Association. In 1972, Moody worked as an artist-in-residence in Berlin. She went on to work at Cornell and in 1975, released a collection of short stories, titled Mr. Death: Four Stories. One of the stories, New Hope for the Seventies, won the silver award from Mademoiselle magazine. She and Austin Straus divorced in 1977. Moody declined to make public appearances or grant interviews, with one exception: the above-mentioned interview with Debra Spencer, in 1985. Moody was absent from the spotlight during and after the civil rights movement, partly because she (like many people) needed time to heal from the physical and psychological wounds received during those efforts. She lived in New York City, worked as a counselor for the New York City Poverty Program, and had been working on a book, The Clay Gully, prior to her death. Books * (Delta reprint, 2004, ).

Pope Gregory XVI granted the image a Canonical Coronation on 15 August 1838 through the Papal bull C√¶lestis Regina. Pope Pius XII crowned the image again and ordered a public religious procession during the Marian year of 1954. The image was cleaned and restored by the Vatican Museum in 2018. The phrase Salus Populi Romani goes back to the legal system and pagan rituals of the ancient Roman Republic.Livy, Book 7: \\"Nobis deum benignitate, felicitate tua populique Romani, et res et gloria est integra...\\" After the legalisation of Christianity by Emperor Constantine the Great through the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, the phrase was sanctioned as a Marian title for the Blessed Virgin Mary.Gerhard Wolf, \\"Salus Populi Tomani\\" in Die Geschicte r√∂mische Kultbilder (Weinheim, 1991) pp161-70; J. Linderski, The Augural Law in Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase, eds. Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren p 2256 (this paper in English)  History  The image is held to have arrived from Crete in the year 590 AD during the Pontificate of Pope Gregory the Great, who welcomed the image in person on its arrival borne with a floral boat from the Tiber river. For centuries it was placed above the door to the baptistery chapel of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (considered the third of the Roman patriarchal basilicas) where in the year 1240 it began to be called Regina Caeli (English: \\"Queen of Heaven\\") in an official document. Later it was moved to the nave, and from the 13th century it was preserved in a marble tabernacle. Since 1613 it has been located in the altar tabernacle of the Cappella Paolina that was built specifically for it, later known to English- speaking pilgrims as the Lady Chapel. The church and its Marian shrine are under the special patronage of the popes. From at least the 15th century, it was honored as a miraculous image, and it was later used by the Jesuit Order in particular to foster devotion to the Mother of God through the Sodality of Our Lady movement. The image is one of the so-called \\"Luke images\\" believed to have been painted from real life by Saint Luke himself. According to the legend: The Roman Breviary states, \\"After the Council of Ephesus (431) in which the Mother of Jesus was acclaimed as Mother of God, Pope Sixtus III erected at Rome on the Esquiline Hill, a basilica dedicated to the honor of the Holy Mother of God. It was afterward called Saint Mary Major and it is the oldest church in the West dedicated to the honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\" The Roman Pontifical gives the following account:  Description  alt= The image is five feet high by three and a quarter feet wide (117 x 79 cm) ‚Äì very large for an icon, especially one with an early date. It is painted on a thick cedar panel. Mary wears a gold-trimmed, dark blue mantle over a purple/red tunic. The letters in Greek at the top identify Mary as \\"Mother of God\\" (ŒúŒÆœÑŒ∑œÅ ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶ in lower case and ŒúHŒ§HŒ° ŒòŒïŒüŒ• in upper case), as is usual in Byzantine art (Christ may originally have had an inscription under later re-painting). Christ is holding a book in his left hand, presumably a Gospel Book. His right hand is raised in a blessing, and it is Mary not he who looks directly out at the viewer. The folded together position of Mary's hands distinguishes this image as a version of the earlier type from before the development of the iconography of the Hodegetria image in the 10th century, where she points to Christ with her right hand.Vasilakƒì, Maria. Images of the Mother of God: Perceptions of the Theotokos in Byzantium, p.196, Ashgate publishing Co, Burlington, Vermont, \\"Rather than offering the Child, she keeps his body closer to hers and seeks physical and tactile contact with him.\\" However the few other examples of this type do not have the Virgin's hands folded together ‚Äì the right hand holds Christ's knee. The Virgin holding in her right hand a mappa (or mappula, a sort of embroidered ceremonial handkerchief), originally a consular symbol, later an imperial one, means this image is probably one of the type showing Mary as Regina coeli or \\"Queen of Heaven\\".Topographies of Power in the Early Middle Ages By Mayke de Jong, F. (Frans) Theuws, Carine van Rhijn, p64 In addition, the Virgin also wears a plain, golden, ring band in her middle finger of her right hand, later obscured by a gemstone. The image no longer wears its Canonical crowns and jeweled regalia, which has now been transferred in the treasury of the sacristy of Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica.  Dating by art historians  The image adorned with its Canonical crowns and jewel regalia, no longer attached today. The crowns are stored within the treasury department of Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica. The image \\"has been confidently dated to almost every possible period between the fifth century and the thirteenth\\".de Jong op cit, p64, n.33 The recent full-length study by Gerhard Wolf says, cautiously, that it is \\"probably Late Antique\\" in its original form. The icon in its current state of overpainting seems to be a work of the 13th century (as witnessed by the features of the faces), but other layers visible under the top one suggest it is a repainting of a much earlier piece; especially revealing is the modeling of Child's right hand in the first layer, which can be compared to other early Christian icons that display 'Pompeian' illusionistic qualities.Herbert Kessler, Rome 1300: on the path of the pilgrim, Yale University Press, 2000. The areas of linear stylization, such as Christ's garment which is rendered in golden hatching producing a flat effect, seem to go back to the 8th century, and can be compared with a very early icon of Elijah from Mount Sinai. A second restoration process started around 1100 and came to an end in the 13th century. The Virgin's blue mantle which is wrapped over her purple dress was severely altered in the outline; the red halos are also not part of the original image. The image type itself suggests it is not a medieval invention, but rather an Early Christian concept dating from antiquity: a majestic, half-length portrait showing a frank outward gaze of the rulerlike Virgin, with her upright, stately pose and folded hands gently clasping the Child, unique among all icons. Lively turning of the maturely developed and attired Child also attests to the painting's antiquity. The vivid contrapposto of the two bodies, which suggests direct observation, can be compared with a 5th-century Mount Sinai icon of the Virgin and Child in Kiev, and contrasted with the Pantheon Marian icon from 609, which already shows the Mother slightly subordinated to the Child by the imploring gesture and the turn of the head, and where the interaction of the bodies exists only in a flat plane.Hans Belting, Likeness and Presence: a history of the image before the era of art, The University of Chicago Pres, 1996. These comparisons suggest a date of the 7th century for the icon. The early fame of the icon can be gauged from the production of replicas (a fresco in Santa Maria Antiqua seems to have reproduced it already in the 8th century), and the role it played in the ritual on the feast of the Virgin's Assumption, where the Acheiropoieta (the panel painting of Christ from the Lateran Basilica) was moved in a procession to Santa Maria Maggiore to 'meet' with it. Monneret de Villard has shown that engravings of this icon brought by Jesuits to Ethiopia influenced the art of that country from the 17th century onwards, repeating \\"every detail of her own and the Child's posture, the position of the hands being especially characteristic.\\"David Buxton, The Abyssinians (New York: Praeger, 1970), p. 148 More far flung apparent copies include a Moghul miniature, presumably based on a copy given to Akbar by the Jesuits, and copies in China, of which a 16th-century example is in the Field Museum in Chicago.  Pontifical approbations  The image has been venerated by several Popes and acted as a Roman Catholic Mariological symbol, for the city of Rome and its peoples. * Pope Gregory I in 593 had the icon carried throughout Rome during the Easter festivals and prayed for an end to a plague at that time. * Pope Pius V in 1571 to pray for victory at the Battle of Lepanto * Pope Gregory XVI also venerated the image in 1837 to pray for the end of the cholera epidemic. The same Pontiff would crown the image a year later on 15 August 1838, the Marian feast of the Assumption whilst issuing his Papal bull C√¶lestis Regina. * Pope Pius XII ordered the icon to be carried through Rome in a procession to celebrate the first Marian year;The Church at Prayer by Ir√©n√©e Henri Dalmais, Aim√© Georges Martimort, Pierre Jounel 1985 page 135 and issued another coronation to the image accompanying his Papal encyclical Ad C≈ìli Reginam, which also initiated the feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The same Pontiff in 2020 used the icon during an extraordinary Urbi et Orbi blessing to pray for an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restoration In 2017, the Vatican Museum was tasked with the full restoration and conservation process of the venerated image. The restoration process included the following conservations: * Refilling of insect holes and various damage to the image, to the mantle, faces and background. * The restoration of its golden halo, from the corroded red lacquer (oxidized). * The brightening of the faces of the image, re-highlighting its facial structures. * The repainting of the hands and forehead cross, once obscured by gemstones and various ornaments. * The restoration of the mantle to its indigo blue paint and its diagonal checkered border. * The varnishing of the backside of the image, strengthening its original frame. The process was completed within a year and was given the honor of a Pontifical Mass by Pope Francis on 28 January 2018, on the anniversary of the translation of the icon to its new permanent shrine.  In the Schoenstatt Movement  Salus Populi Romani is also said to be the source of the title Mater ter Admirabilis (Mother Thrice Admirable) used for the Blessed Virgin Mary within the Schoenstatt Marian Movement. Salus Populi Romani was the centerpiece of the Colloquium Marianum in Ingolstadt, in 1604. According to the Schoenstatt, on 6 April 1604, Father Jakob Rem, SJ, desired to know which of the invocations from the litany of Loreto would please the Virgin Mary the most. He reported that after meditation and looking at the image of Salus Populi Romani, the title Mother Thrice Admirable was revealed to him. The title Mother Thrice Admirable has since become part of the Schoenstatt Movement and is also associated with another well known Madonna, namely the 1898 Refugium Peccatorum Madonna by the Italian artist Luigi Crosio which was purchased by the Schoenstatt Sisters in Switzerland in 1964 and has since been called the Mother Thrice Admirable Madonna.

First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797) The War of the First Coalition broke out in autumn 1792, when several European powers formed an alliance against Republican France. The first major operation was the annexation of the County of Nice and the Duchy of Savoy (both states of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia) by 30,000 French troops. This was reversed in mid-1793, when the Republican forces were withdrawn to deal with a revolt in Lyon, triggering a counter-invasion of Savoy by the Kingdom of Piedmont- Sardinia (a member of the First Coalition). After the revolt in Lyon had been suppressed, the French under General Kellermann managed to push back the Piedmontese with just 12,000 troops, winning engagements at Argentines and St Maurice in September and October 1793. The conflict soon escalated with Austrian and Neapolitan forces being mobilised for an invasion of southern France to recover Nice and strike into Provence. The Allied forces were bolstered by some 45,000 Austrians, Piedmontese, and Neapolitans, with additional support from the British Royal Navy. Before the Allies could launch this assault the French, under tactical command of Andr√© Mass√©na, launched the Saorgio Offensive (April, 1794), which was planned by the army's artillery commander, General Napoleon Bonaparte. This two-pronged French offensive drove back the Allied force, despite their strong positions, and firmly captured the mountain passes that led into Piedmont. A new offensive, again devised by General Bonaparte, was similarly successful despite its more complicated nature, calling for the co-ordination of the Army of Italy and the Army of the Alps. Further French assaults on the Allied positions were called off under orders from war minister Carnot, who was concerned about supply lines being cut by rebels behind the front. The commanders in the field were unhappy about this decision, but appeals were interrupted by the overthrow of the Committee of Public Safety and its leader, Maximilien de Robespierre (28 July 1794). During the political chaos that ensued in the French army, the Allies launched an assault on Savona. Ignoring Carnot's orders, the commander of the Army of Italy launched a counter-offensive and secured supply routes to Genoa following victory at the First Battle of Dego. Following this the French consolidated the front and awaited further opportunities. The main focus of the war then shifted north to the Rhine, until 29 June 1795, when the Austrians launched an attack against the depleted and poorly supplied French Army of Italy. Nominally 107,000-strong, the Army of Italy could only manage to field an effective force of about 30,000. Kellermann, who had resumed command, appealed to Carnot for reinforcements. Instead, General Bonaparte was appointed to the general staff where he devised a third plan for an attack towards Vado and Ceva. Kellermann was replaced by General Sch√©rer soon after and he carried out the attacks, gaining victory at Loano. =Bonaparte's war= Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David. Following a short respite in hostilities Sch√©rer resigned and Bonaparte was appointed commander- in-chief on 2 March 1796. The motives for Bonaparte's appointment were most likely political. On 9 March, Bonaparte had married Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, who had shared her imprisonment (under Robespierre) with the woman who had become wife to Tallien, one of the then Directors of the French Republic. It was \\"universally believed\\" that Josephine had been introduced by her friend to the First Director, Barras, and had become his lover. Lockhart phrases this elliptically, \\"It was commonly said‚Äîindeed it was universally believed‚Äîthat Josephine, whose character was in some respects indifferent, possessed more than legitimate influence over the First Director.\\" Josephine's letters claim Barras had promised the command to Bonaparte, before she'd consented to marry him. John Gibson Lockhart, Napoleon Buonaparte, new edition, (London: Bickers & Son, 1927). Barras is cited by his colleagues as saying of Bonaparte, \\"Advance this man or he will advance himself without you.\\" Bonaparte had shown himself to be highly ambitious and had made a name for himself following 13 Vend√©miaire in 1795.McLynn 1998, p.94 By placing him in command of the Army of Italy, Bonaparte was being assigned to an obscure front: of the Republic's thirteen principal field armies, the Italian force was the most neglected and was in terrible condition when Bonaparte arrived. Bonaparte launched attacks almost immediately after he arrived on the front on 27 March. His 37,000 men and 60 guns were facing more than 50,000 Allied troops in the theatre. His only chance of support came from Kellermann's Army of the Alps, which was faced by a further 20,000 Allied troops. Bonaparte had no chance of gaining reinforcements as the Republican war effort was being concentrated on the massive offensives planned on the Rhine. At the Battle of Montenotte Bonaparte defeated the Austrians and fought a second engagement around Dego soon after. Following these battles he launched an all-out invasion of Piedmont and won a further victory at Mondov√¨. Piedmont was forced to accept the Armistice of Cherasco on 28 April, knocking it out of the war and the First Coalition. It had taken Bonaparte just a month to defeat Piedmont (between his arrival and the armistice), a country which had resisted the French armies for over three years. Total losses during the lightning campaign were 6,000 French troops and over 25,000 Allied. Bonaparte reorganised his newly enthused army following the short let-up in operations that followed Piedmont's defeat. Following this he manoeuvred his army into more opportune positions along the Po River. A small French victory at Codogno led to a retreat by Coalition forces across the Adda River. At the river, the Austrian army of General Beaulieu was defeated in the Battle of Lodi on 10 May. The Army of Italy was now reinforced to almost 50,000 men and Bonaparte continued on the offensive, striking at Austrian forces mobilising in the vicinity of the fortress of Mantua. A series of minor Coalition defeats resulted in the garrison at Mantua being reinforced to 12,000. Placing Mantua under siege, Bonaparte then led a French division south to invade and occupy Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States, defeating Papal forces at Fort Urban. Next he turned north and with 20,000 men defeated some 50,000 Austrians under Field Marshal Wurmser at the battles of Lonato and Castiglione. The Austrian commander was forced back into the Alps. Wurmser was reinforced once again to compensate for some 20,000 losses sustained in the past two months and made an attempt to relieve the siege of Mantua. Some 45,000 Austrian troops were left behind to guard against any new French offensive whilst the main body of the Austrian army moved on Mantua. At Rovereto on 4 September, Bonaparte inflicted a heavy defeat on the Austrians and was then well-placed to strike at the rear of Wurmser's army. Reacting slowly to this new threat, the Austrians were again defeated at the Battle of Bassano, where their army was reduced to just 12,000. The remaining troops marched rapidly towards Mantua, but became trapped there by General Mass√©na's advance party. bridge of Arcole Additional Austrian forces arrived whilst Bonaparte's army was weakened by disease and his supply lines threatened by rebellion. Government political commissars, especially Cristoforo Saliceti, brutally put down the uprisings, but the French position was weakened. To stabilise the situation Bonaparte created the client states of Transpadane Republic and the Cispadane Republic. Following this a new Austrian commander, Joseph Alvinczy, arrived and made another attempt to relieve Mantua. Bonaparte drove back Alvinczy, but his counter-offensive was seriously hampered by Vaubois‚Äô defeat over five days in the villages of Cembra and Calliano. Alvinczy held off a French attack at Caldiero on 12 November and Bonaparte was forced to withdraw. In the following three-day Battle of Arcole, Bonaparte won an important and surprising victory against Alvinczy. Both sides were reinforced before Alvinczy launched another attack in January. Bonaparte defeated this renewed assault at the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting some 14,000 casualties. Then he surrounded and captured a second Austrian relief column near Mantua. Soon after, Mantua finally surrendered to the French, making it possible for the French to continue their advance eastwards towards Austria. After a brief campaign during which the Austrian army was commanded by the Emperor's brother, the Archduke Charles, the French advanced to within 100 miles of Vienna, and the Austrians sued for peace. Bonaparte's campaign was important in bringing an end to the War of the First Coalition. Second Coalition (1799‚Äì1800) The second phase of the war in Italy began in 1799 as part of the War of the Second Coalition and was different from the first in that Russian forces participated in the campaign. However, at the beginning of the conflict the Russians were yet to arrive. Bonaparte, meanwhile, was away from the continent, as from May, 1798 to September, 1799 he was leading the Egyptian Campaign. Some 60,000 French troops under Sch√©rer faced off against an equal number of Austrians. An additional 50,000 Russians were expected to arrive shortly. The French were occupied with the pacification of Naples and this halved their effective strength to face the Austrians. In order to avoid a completely untenable situation arising, Sch√©rer attacked as soon as possible in an attempt to preempt Austrian attacks. Russian troops under Generalissimo Suvorov crossing the Alps in 1799. Austrian commander P√°l Kray defeated the French at Verona and Magnano in late March and early April. Sch√©rer retreated back and left a small detachment of 8,000 in several forts. The Austrian commander, Michael von Melas, was slow to pursue the retreating French and was soon replaced as overall Coalition commander in the theatre by the brilliant Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov. Sch√©rer too was soon replaced by General Moreau, a man of greater fame and prestige. The French defeat at the Battle of Cassano on 26 April was followed by withdrawal from Lombardy and an overall unfavourable situation for the French. General Macdonald's army returned from Naples to support Moreau. An initial Allied attack across the Po failed on 11 May. Moreau's army was in tatters with just 9,000 men remaining. An attempted counter-attack was beaten back by Russian General Petr Bagration. Suvorov soon occupied Turin and proclaimed the restoration of Piedmont to its king. The Army of the Alps engaged the Austro-Russian forces in a series of minor skirmishes, but did not come to the rescue of the Army of Italy. Suvorov overran a number of French garrisons and continued his relentless advance. Macdonald engaged Suvorov in the Battle of the Trebbia and was crushed. Macdonald retreated with the remnant of his army to Genoa whilst Suvorov reached Novi. The Austrian high command ordered a halt to Allied offensives whilst the French garrisons of Mantua and Alessandria were overrun (see siege of Mantua and siege of Alessandria). Soon after this Moreau was dispatched to the Rhine and Joubert was sent to command the Army of Italy. Suvorov, acting under orders from the Coalition high command, paused to gather his strength for an offensive in Autumn. On 9 August, the French launched offensive of 38,000 men called the Battle of Novi. The offensive was thoroughly defeated by Suvorov, and resulted in the death of Joubert. Moreau, who had yet to depart for the Rhine, seized the initiative and led the survivors back to Genoa and began preparing a defence of the city. Suvorov monument in the Swiss Alps However at that time the Allied high command in Vienna ordered Suvorov to move out of Italy and concentrate on breaking through the Swiss front. The respite thus given the reeling Army of Italy led to a turning point in the war. Melas, who resumed command of Coalition forces in Italy, now almost exclusively Austrian, paused the offensive and consolidated his forces, now that the Russians had been removed from Italy. By the spring of 1800 Russia had withdrawn entirely from the Coalition. The situation in Italy, however, was still very much on the side of the Coalition. Melas had some 100,000 men under his command, opposed by just 50,000 French troops who were thoroughly dispersed. The Allies prepared for a thrust into southern France and across the Rhine, much further north. Melas moved forward slowly, laying siege to Genoa and halting his advance elsewhere. It was at this time that the First Consul of France, Napoleon Bonaparte (who had seized French power in the Brumaire Coup of 9 November 1799) led his Reserve Army through the Great St Bernard pass with the aim of relieving Mass√©na in the Siege of Genoa, who was threatened by severe food shortages resulting from the combination of encirclement on land and naval blockade by the British. Genoa fell before the First Consul could reach it. He concentrated his army and struck at the Austrians in an attempt to beat them before they too concentrated their forces again. The Reserve Army fought a battle at Montebello on 9 June before the main confrontation at Marengo. The consul was almost defeated here until General Desaix made a timely arrival with reinforcements and drove back Melas, thus turning a French rout into a French victory. In this counter-attack Desaix was killed, but Bonaparte later honoured him with monuments commemorating his bravery and his name has the place of honour on the face of the Arc de Triomphe, which was erected to celebrate Napoleon's victories. Marengo was the last major engagement on the Italian front during the Revolutionary Wars. Following it the massive Battle of Hohenlinden brought the Austrians to the negotiating table (singing the Armistice of Treviso) and the war ended shortly after.

It has been one of the most-exported United Kingdom television shows; according to the Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television (PACT), it had been sold to 129 countries by April 2005. The series follows a group of real-life volunteers as they are trained by former spies in espionage techniques, including maintaining a false identity, surveillance, persuasion and recruitment. The programme's psychological challenges, dramatic tension, high production values, and personable cast led to its being called 'the most addictive thing on TV at the moment' by The Daily Telegraph. The series further develops a format that first appeared in the Wall to Wall television productions Spymaster (2002; UK) and Spymaster USA (2003; USA). SPY: A Handbook, a companion book written by Harry Ferguson, a trainer featured on the show, was published in 2004 by Bloomsbury in the UK ().  Candidates and competition  Over 5,000 candidates from across the United Kingdom applied to be on the show. The candidates were narrowed down to a pool of eight recruits before the start of the show. As the show progressed, recruits who failed to demonstrate sufficient potential as agents were unceremoniously dismissed from the competition. In the final episode, Nicola Jackson emerged as the winner, but there was no prize other than the satisfaction of knowing that they had what it takes to be a real spy. The recruits, in alphabetical order, were: * Daoh, Andrew (19, male) * Dhiri, Reena (28, female) * Dilworth, Simon (35, male) * Glantz, Suzi (58, female) * Jackson, Nicola (24, female) * Moule, Jennie (27, female) * van Schweiger, Max (35, male) * Winn, Gabriel (24, male) The three experts, called their \\"tutors\\", who devised the training missions, trained the recruits, and evaluated their performance were: * Mike Baker, a former CIA field operations officer * Sandy Williams, a former Intelligence Officer * Harry Ferguson, formerly of MI6 Additional training was conducted by John Potter, and narration was provided by Paul Brightwell.  Episodes  Ten hour-long episodes were originally produced. The show was then recut into a series of 15 half-hour episodes. Broadcasters in some markets air the original series, while broadcasters in other markets air the other. Summaries published for the original ten episodes follow: ; #101 -- Into the Unknown : Stripped of their old identities, the raw recruits meet for the first time in London on day one. They receive their first briefing from their 'tutors.' With no time to unpack, they are sent on their first mission: a real test used by Mossad, the Israeli Secret Service. They are given just 10 minutes to talk their way into a stranger‚Äôs flat and be seen by their trainers drinking a glass of water on the balcony. After only 24 hours on the course, the recruits must learn a vital lesson: every spy can break under pressure. Without warning they are abducted from their safe-houses in the middle of the night and interrogated by intelligence professionals. They must stick to their cover names and avoid giving away any details about their real lives. ; #102 -- Open Your Eyes : The wannabe spies hone their skills at 'going grey' - the art of mingling in a crowd without being noticed. The trainers instruct them in using effective body language and building an instant rapport with strangers. The recruits then embark on their toughest mission yet, which will test their skills of persuasion, nerve and the ability to think on their feet. They attempt to gain access to an office building (during working hours) and take photographs of confidential documents without getting caught. ; #103 -- Under Cover : The greatest spies in history are those who blend effortlessly into any new environment. Will the recruits be up to the job? Their mission brief is simple ‚Äì go undercover, assume a new identity and fool those around them into believing that they‚Äôre someone they‚Äôre not. Their trainers, real former spies, are monitoring their progress and have a devious trap to find the recruits out. Will all of them make it through? ; #104 -- The Confidence of Strangers : The recruits continue their quest to master the spying game. Following the dismissal of the first candidate, the remaining recruits struggle with their feelings as they are taught the ruthless art of cultivation - how to lie and manipulate others. Whether it‚Äôs gaining confidential information from a hotel receptionist or getting a total stranger to look after a sensitive document for them, the recruits will need all their skills of charm and persuasion to pull it off. The recruits‚Äô final, highly confidential mission is to win the trust of each other‚Äôs nearest and dearest. They are to manipulate the person to gain entry into the family home and photograph the master bedroom without being detected. ; #105 -- Too Close for Comfort : The art of surveillance is a core skill for any would-be spy. Working in teams, the recruits practice the basics of following targets without being noticed or drawing attention to themselves. The would-be spies are tested as the trainers watch and judge them on their triumphs and failures. For their latest mission, the recruits must use all their spy skills and put their professionalism to the ultimate test in a one-on-one surveillance mission in Brighton. They don‚Äôt realize until the last minute that their target is actually their closest friend or family member whom they haven‚Äôt been allowed to see since starting the course. If they allow their personal feelings to compromise the mission, they risk being thrown out of spy school. ; #106 -- Safe as Houses : Having mastered observation and surveillance skills, the recruits are now faced with their first 36-hour mission. They have to mount a surveillance operation on the occupants of two target houses. They must break into target properties, plant secret cameras and bugs and fix tracking devices to cars. Split into teams, the recruits‚Äô relationships are put to the test as they share cramped and claustrophobic living conditions for the duration of their stake-out. ; #107 -- Crossing the Line : The art of cultivating an agent is the core work of an intelligence officer. Teaming up in pairs, the six remaining recruits take temporary jobs at a barber shop, a gym and a clothing store. Their fellow employees are unaware that their new coworkers are spies. After working undercover cultivating and befriending a complete stranger in order to turn them into their agent, it is time for the recruits to complete their mission. They will have to manipulate their target and get them to cross the line of morality, by persuading them to lie, sign a fake document or help them in a legally questionable way. ; #108 -- The Enemy Within : After six weeks on the course, the recruits have learned to rely on each other and have come to appreciate the value of trust and collaboration. But this time they will have to embrace the darker side of spying: betrayal. Two recruits are the subjects of internal investigations and it is up to their fellow spies to set a trap and gather incriminating evidence. For some this will mean the end of the course. Spy school is closed and the recruits are about to graduate to their final mission, but first they must pass the ultimate test of loyalty. They find out what it‚Äôs like when a spy thinks their organization has turned against them, and that they‚Äôve been left out in the cold. ; #109 -- Out in the Cold : The tension mounts as the four remaining recruits are exposed to their most dangerous scenario to date and their loyalty is tested to the limit. The trainers have assigned all the recruits a mission that is truly impossible. Each recruit is led to believe that, having failed, they must leave the project. The recruits must keep their heads among false sex scandals and offers of vast sums of money from PR consultant Max Clifford. At their most vulnerable, will they give in to greed and hunger for instant fame, fall into the trap and betray their organization by selling secrets to the tabloids? As in the real world of espionage, any recruit who betrays their organization will face the consequences. ; #110 -- End Game : The final three recruits have been tested to their limits and beyond in their bid to come to grips with the spying game. With their training now complete, the trio must undertake a final confidential mission abroad, working against professionals. Without the support of their trainers and unsure if they can trust each other, they must complete their mission without being detected by their target or the local authorities. There is also a final twist in the tale, as the recruits and their cameraman are taken by police for questioning at local jail. Only one recruit will return from this mission as the perfect spy.

He was born Louis Cicot in Boucherville, Lower Canada in 1812. He studied law and was called to the bar in 1839. He helped found the Aide-toi, le Ciel t‚Äôaidera (God helps those who help themselves) society, which is credited with introducing the celebration of Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day for French Canadians, and was also its secretary-treasurer. He supported the Patriotes but apparently took no part in the Rebellions of 1837‚Äì38. He believed, correctly as it turned out, that rebellion would lead only to an imposed union with Upper Canada. In 1838, he set up a practice in Saint-Hyacinthe. In 1851, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly representing Saint-Hyacinthe. He became part of the Hincks-Morin government for a short time in August 1853. He was re-elected in 1854 and elected speaker. In the same year, he was named Queen's Counsel. In November 1857, he was chosen as Commissioner of Crown Lands, serving until 1 August 1858.Report of the Bureau of Archives for the Province of Ontario vol. 1, p. 47 He was re-elected in 1858 and became Commissioner of Public Works in the Cartier-Macdonald government from 1858 to 10 January 1859. He was Joint Premier of the Province of Canada with John Sandfield Macdonald from May 24, 1862 to May 15, 1863. He refused a cabinet post in the Macdonald-Dorion government that followed and, after his reelection in 1863, introduced a motion of non-confidence, which was rejected by a small margin. In September 1863, he accepted an appointment as judge of the Superior Court in the Saint-Hyacinthe district, serving until 1887. He died in Saint-Hyacinthe in 1889.

Dramatic structure Wilson's first full-length play, Balm in Gilead centers on a caf√© frequented by heroin addicts, prostitutes, and thieves. It features many unconventional theatrical devices, such as overlapping dialogue, simultaneous scenes, and unsympathetic lead characters. The plot draws a parallel between the amoral and criminal activity that the characters engage in to provide escape from their boredom and suffering, and the two main characters' becoming a couple in order to escape from their lives. The play takes its title from a quote in the Old Testament (Book of Jeremiah, chapter 46, verse 11). Production history Wilson wrote the play while living in New York City, finding inspiration by sitting in caf√©s and eavesdropping. He approached Marshall W. Mason, whom he knew from the Caffe Cino, to direct the production.

Plot summary Balm in Gilead is set in Frank's caf√©, a greasy spoon diner in New York City's Upper Broadway neighborhood, over the course of three days. The plot loosely centers on Joe, a cynical drug dealer, and Darlene, a na√Øve new arrival to the city. Joe and Darlene spend the night together hours after meeting, but he soon pushes her away, overwhelmed by his debt to a local kingpin named Chuckles. Meanwhile, Darlene finds herself ill-equipped to handle life in a slum, and she becomes increasingly vulnerable to the attentions of the various low-rent men who hang around the caf√© looking for an easy target. Joe sees in Darlene a chance for a fresh start, and briefly considers giving up dealing. Just as he is about to return Chuckles' money, however, he is killed by one of the dealer's thugs. The play ends with all the lead characters droning their lines from the first scene over and over again in a circle, implying that their lives are stuck in a demoralizing rut.

NGC 147 is a member of the Local group of galaxies and a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It forms a physical pair with the nearby galaxy NGC 185, another remote satellite of M31. It was discovered by John Herschel in September 1829. Visually it is both fainter and slightly larger than NGC 185 (and therefore has a considerably lower surface brightness). This means that NGC 147 is more difficult to see than NGC 185, which is visible in small telescopes. In the Webb Society Deep-Sky Observer's Handbook, the visual appearance of NGC 147 is described as follows: > Large, quite faint, irregularly round; it brightens in the middle to a > stellar nucleus. The membership of NGC 147 in the Local Group was confirmed by Walter Baade in 1944 when he was able to resolve the galaxy into individual stars with the telescope at Mount Wilson near Los Angeles. Characteristics A survey of the brightest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the area of radius 2‚Ä≤ from the center of NGC 147 shows that the last significant star-forming activity in NGC 147 occurred around 3 Gyr ago. NGC 147 contains a large population of older stars which show a spread in metallicity and age. The metallicity spread suggests that NGC 147 has had chemical enrichment. However, H I has not been observed and the interstellar medium (ISM) mass upper limit is much lower than expected had the material which is emitted from evolving stars been kept in the galaxy. This implies depletion of the ISM. Distance measurements At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to NGC 147. The surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to NGC 147 using this technique is 2.67 ¬± 0.18 Mly (870 ¬± 60 kpc). However, NGC 147 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to NGC 147 using this technique is 2.21 ¬± 0.09 Mly (680 ¬± 30 kpc). Averaged together, these distance measurements give a distance estimate of 2.53 ¬± 0.11 Mly (780 ¬± 30 kpc).

Provincial Politics In 1836, Sherwood was elected to the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada representing the town of Brockville. This was the last Parliament of the province of Upper Canada, which in 1841 was united with the province of Lower Canada into the new Province of Canada by the Act of Union 1840, enacted by the British Parliament. In March 1841, Sherwood stood for election to the new Parliament of the Province of Canada, this time from Toronto, with the Mayor of Toronto, George Monro, as his co-candidate on a Tory ticket. Despite having the full backing of the Orange Order and the conservative establishment, they were defeated in the election by the Reform candidates, Isaac Buchanan and John Dunn. A riot ensued the next day when a victory parade by the Reformers was attacked by Orangemen carrying knives, sticks and firearms. The Orangemen were based at the Coleraine Tavern and had been brought in from Scarborough, Ontario by the tavern's owner, Samuel Sherwood, who happened to be Henry's brother. One man was killed by a shot fired from the tavern. Charles Dickens, visiting Toronto at the time, observed: :It is a matter of deep regret that political differences should have run high in this place, and led to the most discreditable results. It is not long since guns were discharged from a window in this town at the successful candidates in an election, and the coachman of one of them was actually shot in the body, though not dangerously wounded. But one man was killed on the same occasion; and from the very window whence he received his death, the very flag which shielded his murderer (not only in the commission of his crime but from its consequences), was displayed again on the occasion of the public ceremony performed by the Governor General, to which I have just adverted. Of all the colours in the rainbow, there is but one which could be so employed: I need not say that the flag was orange.Charles Dickens, American Notes for General Circulation, 1842; reprinted as American Notes and Pictures from Italy (London: Heron Books, 1970), p. 245. In 1843, Dunn resigned from the Legislative Assembly to protest Governor Metcalfe's refusal to consult the Executive Council on patronage appointments. In the resulting by-election, Sherwood again stood for election and was successful. He was re-elected to the second Parliament in 1844, and the third Parliament in 1848. He was not originally elected to the fourth Parliament in 1852, but was elected in 1853 in a by-election. From May 28, 1847, to March 11, 1848, Sherwood served as Joint Premier of the Province of Canada for Canada West along with his counterpart Denis-Benjamin Papineau who represented Canada East. Municipal Politics At the same time, Sherwood was involved in municipal politics in Toronto. He was alderman of St. David's Ward when chosen as the seventh Mayor of Toronto from 1842 to 1844, succeeding Munro. He was a successful mayor. Credit belongs to the committees, but he was the mayor that oversaw the regulation of the market, paving the streets and collecting taxes. In 1842, 94 gas lights illuminated King and Yonge Streets and a waterworks was underway. Mayor Sherwood saw that the Town Hall was too small for the growing civic government and the plans were drawn for Toronto's first municipal offices. Construction began on the new City Hall (now St. Lawrence Market South) in the summer of 1844 at Jarvis and Front Streets. Sherwood sat on city council after his final mayoralty term until 1849. Sherwood's brother and tavern owner, Samuel, would serve as the city's police chief from 1852 to 1859. Death He suffered from ill health later in life and died in Bavaria in 1855 while travelling in Europe.

Born in Saint-Michel-de-Bellechasse, Lower Canada, into a large Roman Catholic farming family, Morin was identified by the parish priest at a young age as a boy of exceptional talent and intelligence. The parish priest therefore arranged for his education at the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, beginning in 1815. After leaving the seminary, Morin worked as newspaperman in order to earn money for the study of law as clerk in the office of Denis-Benjamin Viger. By 1828 he was practicing law independently, and by 1830 had become involved with colonial politics. Morin helped draft the Ninety-Two Resolutions. Although he took part in the Lower Canada Rebellion and was later arrested, it was not felt that a charge of high treason was justified. Following the union of Lower Canada and Upper Canada into the new Province of Canada in 1841, Morin was elected to the first Parliament of the new Province, for the Nicolet electoral district. He resigned his seat a year later on appointment to the district court for Rimouski, but served on the bench for less than a year. He resigned from the court and was re-elected to Parliament, this time for the riding of Saguenay, in November, 1842. Morin served as Joint Premier of the Province of Canada from Canada East along with his counterparts from Canada West Francis Hincks (from October 28, 1851 to September 11, 1854), and with Allan Napier MacNab (from that date until January 27, 1855). He resigned from government due to ill health. However, Morin was named a judge in the Quebec Superior Court and he also took part in the commission which drafted a new civil code for Canada East. Morin-Heights, Quebec and Val-Morin, Quebec, which Morin help found, are named for him. He also helped found Sainte-Ad√®le, Quebec, which was named after his wife Ad√®le Raymond, the sister of Joseph-Sabin Raymond. He died at Sainte-Ad√®le in 1865.

The state park features a clear blue, natural underground spring that pumps of water per hour into two concrete-ringed swimming pools. The park's recreational area was expanded in 2013 when the Forever Wild Land Trust purchased 100 acres adjoining the park for the purpose of providing hiking trails. The Magnolia Trail, along with two short connector trails, opened in 2018. The trail crosses 2 miles of southeast Alabama forest and provides views of the west fork of the Choctawhatchee River. The trailhead is located in the park with most of the trail traversing the adjacent Forever Wild Blue Springs State Park Addition. History Harrison's Hotel, built in 1890, was among the first efforts to turn the village of Blue Springs into a health spa. Ten years later, J.T.E. Whigham began work on the Blue Springs Hotel, which eventually featured 28 rooms and modern bathhouse. In 1913, the spring pool was lined with concrete and another smaller pool designed for use by children was added to the site. The area became a popular spot for political rallies, three-day horse-trading events, and annual reunions of Confederate soldiers. The large pool remained in operation until about 1938. J.D. McLaughlin sold the property to the state resulting in creation of the state park in 1963.

However, there are other species of spider that resemble bird droppings, for example species of Mastophora (a bolas spider). Habitat and appearance The males are much smaller than the females, about 2.5 mm as opposed to 12 mm. The females have up to 13 egg sacs, with about 200 eggs each, strung together with strong threads. Their toxicity is unknown, but may be able to cause mild illness in humans. Celaenia excavata is found throughout large parts of eastern and southern Australia and have also been recorded in central Australia; they are also seen in suburban gardens. The egg sacs of the bird-dropping spider are large, marbled brown colored spheres, each about 12 mm in diameter and containing over 200 eggs. Up to 13 sacs are silked together in a group, beneath which the spider may be found awaiting prey. =Hunting= Its diet consists almost exclusively of male moths, which it hunts at night by mimicking the scent of female moths. The bird dropping spider stays motionless on its web during the day, only hunting for prey at night. It hangs down from a single silk thread and releases a pheromone which mimics the sex smells released by female moths. When a moth comes near, the spider will capture it with its powerful front legs.

The Burmese vipassana movement has its roots in the 19th century, when Theravada Buddhism came to be influenced by western modernism, and some monks tried to restore the Buddhist practice of meditation. Based on the commentaries, Ledi Sayadaw popularized vipassana meditation for lay people, teaching samatha and stressing the practice of satipatthana to acquire vipassana (insight) into the three marks of existence as the main means to attain the beginning of awakening and become a stream- enterer. It was highly popularized in the 20th century in traditional Theravada countries by Mahasi Sayadaw, who introduced the \\"New Burmese Satipatthana Method\\". It also gained a large following in the west, due to westerners who learned vipassana from Mahasi Sayadaw, S. N. Goenka, and other Burmese teachers. Some also studied with Thai Buddhist teachers, who are more critical of the commentarial tradition, and stress the joined practice of samatha and vipassana. The 'American vipassanƒÅ movement' includes contemporary American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein, Tara Brach, Gil Fronsdal, Sharon Salzberg, Ruth Denison and Jack Kornfield. Most of these teachers combine the strict Burmese approach with the Thai approach, and also other Buddhist and non-Buddhist ideas and practices, due to their broader training and their critical approach of the Buddhist sources. And while the New Burmese Method is strictly based on the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma and the Visuddhimagga, western teachers tend to base their practice also on personal experience and on the suttas, which they approach in a more textual-critical way. A recent development, according to some western non-monastic scholars, is the understanding that jhana, as described in the nikayas, is not a form of concentration-meditation, but a training in heightened awareness and equanimity, which forms the culmination of the Buddhist path. None of the well known and broadly respected scholar monks seems to agree with this assumption. History According to Buswell, by the 10th century vipassana was no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of Maitreya. According to Braun, \\"the majority of Theravadins and dedicated Buddhists of other traditions, including monks and nuns, have focused on cultivating moral behavior, preserving the Buddha‚Äôs teachings (dharma), and acquiring the good karma that comes from generous giving.\\" Southern Esoteric Buddhist practices were widespread in the whole Theravadin world before being replaced by the Vipassana movement. The interest in meditation was re-awakened in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728‚Äì1816), who wrote vipassana manuals. The actual practice of meditation was re-invented in Theravada-countries in the 19th and 20th centuries and simplified meditation techniques, based on the Satipatthana sutta, the Visuddhimagga, and other texts, emphasizing satipatthana and bare insight were developed. In the 19th and 20th century the Theravada traditions in Burma, Thailand and Sri Lanka were rejuvenated in response to western colonialism. They were rallying points in the struggle against western hegemonism, giving voice to traditional values and culture. But the Theravada-tradition was also reshaped, using the Pali scriptural materials to legitimize these reforms. Ironically, the Pali canon became widely accessible due to the western interest in those texts, and the publications of the Pali Text Society. A major role was also being played by the Theosophical Society, which sought for ancient wisdom in south-East Asia, and stimulated local interest in its own traditions. The Theosophical Society started a lay-Buddhist organisation in Sri Lanka, independent from power of conventional temples and monasteries. Interest in meditation was awakened by these developments, whereas the main Buddhist practice in temples was the recitation of texts, not of meditation practice. Lay participation in Theravada countries grew strongly in the 20th century, and eventually also reached the west. Most influential in this renewed interest was the \\"new Burmese method\\" of Vipassana practice, as developed by U NƒÅrada (1868‚Äì1955) and popularized by Mahasi Sayadaw (1904‚Äì1982). Ultimately, this practice aims at stream entry, with the idea that this first stage of the path to awakening safeguards future development of the person towards full awakening, despite the degenerated age we live in. This method spread over South and Southeast Asia, Europe and America, and has become synonymous with Vipassana. A comparable development took place in Thailand, where the Buddhist orthodoxy was challenged by monks who aimed to reintroduce the practice of meditation, based on the Sutta Pitaka. In contrast to the Burmese vipassana teachers, Thai teachers taught vipassana in tandem with samatha. The practical and doctrinal differences have been heatedly debated within south-east Asian Theravada Buddhism.Bhikkhu Sujato, Reform They have also influenced western teachers, who have tended to take a more liberal approach, questioning the new orthodoxy and integrating various practices and doctrines.Jack Kornfield (interview), in Shankman (2008), The Experience of Samadhi Since the 1980s, the Vipassana movement has given way to the largely secularized \\"mindfulness\\" practice, which has its roots in Zen and vipassana-meditation, and has eclipsed the popularity of vipassana meditation.Matt Nisbet (2017), The Mindfulness Movement, Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 41.3, May/June 2017 In the latter approach, mindfulness, understood as \\"the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally\\", is the central practice, instead of vipassana.Jon Kabat-Zinn (2013), Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition), p. XXXV Meditation techniques Insight Meditation Practice at Dhammadrops Foundation, Chiang Mai The vipassanƒÅ movement emphasizes the use of vipassanƒÅ to gain insight into the three marks of existence as the main means to attain wisdom and the beginning of awakening and become a stream-enterer, c.q. attain full liberation.Analayo, The Dynamics of TheravƒÅda Insight Meditation, Centre for Buddhist Studies, University of Hamburg Dharma Drum Buddhist College, Taiwan. The practices are based on the Satipatthana sutta, the Visuddhimagga, and other texts, emphasizing satipatthana and bare insight.Cousins, Lance. The Origins of Insight Meditation The various movements espouse forms of samatha and vipassanƒÅ meditation. The various vipassana teachers also make use of the scheme of the insight knowledges, stages of insight which every practitioner passes through in their progress of meditation. The foundation for this progress is the meditation on the arising and passing away of all contemplated phenomena (anicca), which leads to an understanding of their unsatisfactory (dukkha) nature and insight into not-self (anatta).

Contemporary Burmese TheravƒÅda Buddhism is one of the main creators of modern vipassanƒÅ practice, which has gained popularity from the 1950s onward. = Ledi Sayadaw = Ledi Sayadaw (1846‚Äì1923) prepared the ground for the popularisation of meditation by a lay audience, by re- introducing the practice of meditation, based on the Abhidhamma. = S.N. Goenka = S. N. Goenka (1924‚Äì2013) was a well-known Indian lay teacher in the Ledi-lineage who was taught by Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899‚Äì1971). According to S. N. Goenka, vipassanƒÅ techniques are essentially non-sectarian in character, and have universal application. One need not convert to Buddhism to practice these styles of meditation. Meditation centers teaching the vipassanƒÅ popularized by S. N. Goenka exist now in Nepal, India, other parts of Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, Middle East and Africa. In the tradition of S.N.Goenka, vipassanƒÅ practice focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind. The practice is usually taught in 10-day retreats, in which 3 days are given to the practice of anapanasati, intended to increase consistency and precision of attention, and the rest of the time is given to vipassanƒÅ in the form of \\"body sweep\\" practice in which the meditator moves through the body in sections, or as a whole, paying attention to the various sensations that arise without reacting to them. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, \\"this form of meditation has by now become what probably is the most widely taught form of insight meditation world-wide.\\" Analayo, The Dynamics of TheravƒÅda Insight Meditation = Other teachers = Ruth Denison (1922‚Äì2015) was another senior teacher of the U Ba Khin method. Anagarika Munindra studied with both S.N. Goenka and Mahasi Sayadaw, and combined both lineages. Dipa Ma was a student of his. =The Mahasi (\\"New Burmese\\") Method= Teachers The \\"New Burmese method\\" was developed by U NƒÅrada (1868‚Äì1955) and popularized by his student, Mahasi Sayadaw (1904‚Äì1982). It was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1939, but became popular in the 1950s with the arrival of Burmese monks, where it gained great popularity among the laity, but was also severely criticised because of its disregard of samatta. Most senior western vipassana teachers (Goldstein, Kornfield, Salzberg) studied with Mahasi Sayadaw and his student Sayadaw U Pandita. Nyanaponika Thera (1901‚Äì1994) ordained already in the fifties, contributing to the interest in vipassana with his publications. Prominent teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi is a student of Nyanaponika. Ajahn Tong was a Thai master who studied for a short time under Mahasi Sayadaw before returning to found his own Vipassana lineage at Chom Tong in Thailand. Practice The \\"New Burmese Method\\" emphasizes the attainment of vipassana, insight, by practising satipatthana, paying close attention to the ongoing changes in body and mind. Gil Fronsdal: Nyanaponika Thera coined the term \\"bare attention\\" for the mindfulness practice of the \\"new Burmese Method.\\" Yet, Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of \\"correct view\\", not just \\"bare attention\\": =Other Burmese teachers= Mogok Sayadaw Mogok Sayadaw (1899-1962) taught the importance of the awareness of noticing the 'arising' and 'Passing away' of all experience as the way to gain insight into impermanence. Mogok Sayadaw emphasized the importance of right understanding and that a meditator should learn the theory of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada) when practicing vipassana. The Mogok vipassana Method focuses on meditation of Feeling (Vedanannupassana) and meditation on Mind states (Cittanupassana). Pa-Auk Sayadaw The method of the Pa Auk Sayadaw is closely based on the Visuddhimagga, a classic Theravada meditation manual. He promotes the extensive development of the four jhanas, states of meditative absorption and focus. The insight element is based on surveying the body by observing the four elements (earth, water, fire and wind) by using the sensations of hardness, heaviness, warmth and motion. Western teachers who work with this method include Shaila Catherine, Stephen Snyder and Tina Rasmussen. United States and western world Since the early 1980s, insight meditation has gained a growing popularity in the western world, and saw a synthesis of various practices and backgrounds, with the growing insight in its roots and doctrinal background, and the introduction of other modern traditions. A major developments is the popularisation of mindfulness as a technique of its own. =Establishment= Spirit Rock Meditation Center founded by Kornfield in 1987 Jack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein taught a series of classes at Naropa University in 1974, and began teaching a series of retreats together for the next two years. The retreats were modeled on 10- and 30-day Goenka retreats, but the technique taught was mainly based on Mahasi Sayadaw's practice (with the inclusion of Metta meditation). In 1976 Kornfield and Goldstein, along with Sharon Salzberg and Jacqueline Schwartz founded the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, followed by its sister center, Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Marin County, California. =New developments= Kornfield, and related teachers, tend to de-emphasize the religious elements of Buddhism such as \\"rituals, chanting, devotional and merit-making activities, and doctrinal studies\\" and focus on meditative practice. According to Jack Kornfield, Some teachers adhere to a strict 'Burmese approach', in which meditation is equated with kasina (concentration) meditation, and vipassana is the main aim. Others, like Bhikkhu Thannissaro, who trained in Thailand, criticise the Burmese orthodoxy, and propagate an integrative approach, in which samatha and vipassana are developed in tandem. Kornfield, who trained in both Burma and Thailand, also propagates an integrative approach. A main criticism of the Burmese method is its reliance on the commentatorial literature, in which vipassana is separated from samatha, and jhana is equated with concentration meditation.Thanissaro Bhikkhu stresses the fact that the kasina method is marginally treated in the suttas, in which the emphasis is predominantly on jhana. In the suttas, samatha and vipassana are qualities of the mind which are developed together. This point is also reiterated by Shankman, arguing that samatha and vipassana cannot be separated. Groundbreaking research on early Buddhist meditation has been conducted by Bronkhorst, Vetter, Gethin, Gombrich, and Wynne arguing that jhana may have been the core practice of early Buddhism, and noting that this practice was not a form of concentration-meditation, but a cumulative practice resulting in mindful awareness of objects while being indifferent to it. Polak, elaborating on Vetter, notes that the onset of the first dhyana is described as a quite natural process, due to the preceding efforts to restrain the senses and the nurturing of wholesome states. Recently Keren Arbel, elaborating on Bronkhorst, vetter and Gethin, has argued that mindfulness, jhana, samatha and vipassana form an integrated whole, leading to an alert, joyful and compassionate state of mind and being. Polak and Arbel, following Gethin, further note that there is a \\"definite affinity\\" between the four jhanas and the bojjha·πÖgƒÅ, the seven factors of awakening. =Mindfulness= The \\"bare attention\\" propagated in the New Burmese Method has been popularized as mindfulness, starting with Jon Kabat Zinn's mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed in the late 1970s, and continuing in applications such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM). The Pa-auk method is mindfulness of breathing based on sutan and visuddhimagga. Prominent women Women have been quite prominent as teachers in the vipassanƒÅ movement. Though the formal TheravƒÅda vipassanƒÅ tradition has been maintained by an almost exclusively male monastic tradition, nuns and non-monastic female adepts have played important roles, despite being completely absent or only noted in the background of the historical record. These teachers and practitioners expand the framework of vipassanƒÅ to incorporate the immanence of the female body and its innate opportunities for enlightenment through the cycles of its physiology and the emotions of marriage, childlessness, childbearing, child loss, and widowhood. =Dipa Ma= The modern Bangladeshi teacher Dipa Ma, a student of Anagarika Munindra, was one of the first female Asian masters to be invited to teach in America. As a widowed, single mother, Dipa Ma was a householder (non-monastic) who exemplified liberation and taught vipassanƒÅ as not only a retreat practice but also a lifestyle. Her message to women and men was you don't have to leave your family to reach high states of spiritual understanding, and she taught a radical inclusiveness. She encouraged women who were mothers of young children to practice vipassanƒÅ through the daily activities of mothering. She once said to Joseph Goldstein that \\"Women have an advantage over men because they have more supple minds... It may be difficult for men to understand this, because they are men.\\" When asked if there was any hope for men, she replied \\"The Buddha was a man, and Jesus was a man. So there is hope for you.\\"Schmidt, Amy. Dipa Ma: The Life & Legacy of a Buddhist Master Blue Bridge Books, 2005, p. 120. Dipa Ma's mettƒÅ (loving-kindness) meditation instruction was a core component to be practiced after each vipassanƒÅ session. It involves five stages, the first of which was the mastery of self-compassion in mind and heart, then continuing to the other stages. The prayer of the first stage, given in English is as follows: =Ilaichidevi Goenka= Indian teacher Ilaichidevi Goenka, was the wife of the Burmese-trained S. N. Goenka and mother of six children, began practicing adhittan vipassanƒÅ when her youngest child was four years old,http://www.udaya.dhamma.org/ebook/Sayagyi_U_Ba_Khin_Journal/Interview_with_Mataji.html eventually joining her husband on the teaching platform as co-teacher to thousands of students at retreat centers and prisons all over India as well as internationally. Prisoners who do vipassanƒÅ meditation reportedly experience less behavior problems while incarcerated and have lower rates of recidivism. \\"Mataji\\", as she is lovingly referred to by her students, also used to lead chants with her husband. =Shambhavi Chopra= Indian Shambhavi Chopra, a former textiles designer and divorced mother of two who is now co-director of the American Institute of Vedic Studies, writes of her 10-day vipassanƒÅ meditation training at a retreat center in Germany in her book Yogini: The Enlightened Woman,Chopra, Shambhavi. Yogini: The Enlightened Woman, Wisdom Tree Press, 2007. and encourages students to explore vipassanƒÅ practice and mastery as a devotion to the Divine Mother of all. VipassanƒÅ in prisons VipassanƒÅ movement traditions have offered meditation programs in some prisons. One notable example was in 1993 when Kiran Bedi, a reformist Inspector General of India's prisons, learned of the success of vipassanƒÅ in a jail in Jaipur, Rajasthan. A ten-day retreat involved officials and inmates alike was then tried in India's largest prison Tihar Jail near New Delhi. Vipassana is being taught in Jail 4 of Tihar Prisons to inmates in two ten day courses every month around the year since 1994 onwards. This program was said to have dramatically changed the behavior of inmates and jailers alike. Inmates who completed the ten-day course were less violent and had a lower recidivism rate than other inmates. This project was documented in the documentary film, Doing Time, Doing Vipassana. Vipassana prison courses are routinely offered at the Donaldson Prison Facility in Alabama through the Vipassana Prison Trust.

He was the first masked hero to appear in American comic books. History Created by cartoonist George Brenner, the Clock first appeared in the Comics Magazine Company publication Funny Picture Stories #1 (Nov 1936). According to Secondary Superheroes of Golden Age Comics: A hypnotist with a secret underground lair, his minimalist costume as a master of disguise was a three-piece suit and mask. The Clock used a number of gadgets (including a cane whose head becomes a projectile, and a diamond stud which fires tear gas), and customarily left a calling card with a clock face and \\"The Clock Has Struck\\". The Clock's secret identity was eventually disclosed as Brian O'Brien, a wealthy member of high society. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"the criminals he fights are usually ordinary gangsters and Nazis, but there is also the occasional mad scientist and superhuman (like the massive, bullet-proof idiot Stuporman)\\". Quality Comics' Crack Comics #1 (May 1940) The character appeared in Funny Pages #6‚Äì11 and other titles from the Comics Magazine Company, including Detective Picture Stories and Keen Detective Funnies. In 1937 the company was bought by Ultem Publications, which encountered financial difficulties and sold the Clock (and other characters) to Quality Comics. Ultem was purchased and renamed Centaur Publications; despite the sale to Quality, Centaur continued to reprint old Clock stories. The Clock continued to be written and drawn in new stories by Brenner in Feature Funnies (later retitled Feature Comics) from #3 (December 1937) through #31 (April 1940), and was featured on the cover of issues #25, #28 and #29. The Clock feature was moved to Crack Comics #1 (May 1940). When Centaur sold the Clock to Quality, he acquired a sidekick. He was first assisted by Pat \\"Pug\\" Brady, a former boxer who looked exactly like Brian O'Brien; they met when picking each other's pockets in Crack Comics #1. Pug's disguise was even more minimal, consisting of a handkerchief worn like a bandanna. In his first story with the Clock, Pug discovered his secret identity and killed another character who made the same discovery. In Crack Comics #21 Pug disappeared without explanation as the Clock, shot, crawled into a basement to die. A young girl, Butch Buchanan, was squatting in the basement and nursed him back to health. She became his \\"moll\\", and from issue #22 his costume was similar to that of the Spirit. The Clock alternated appearances on the cover of Crack Comics with the Black Condor until #19, continuing as a backup feature of that title until his final appearance in Crack Comics #35 (Autumn 1944). After Quality Comics ceased operations in 1956, DC Comics acquired the rights to its characters. It did not renew the copyright for most of its characters (including the Clock), allowing them to fall into the public domain, and has not used the Clock apart from a few mentions. In the DC Universe, the Clock was initially said to have been killed in 1944 (the year of his final appearance). In Starman Vol. 2 #19 the Shade wrote in his journal: \\"Brian O'Brien told me the reports of his death were greatly exaggerated\\". In Starman #20 O'Brien was said to be active in Chicago, despite several Golden Age references to his home city as a seaport. Other versions In 1992, Malibu Comics published 20 issues of The Protectors, starring a superhero team including several characters from the Centaur line. In this universe, Brian O'Brien was the first costumed hero. With the advent of super-powered heroes, he gave up crimefighting and joined the army. O'Brien rose through the ranks, eventually becoming President of the United States. In 2013, Dynamite Entertainment published an eight-issue miniseries, Masks, with several pulp and comic-book characters fighting the Justice Party (which has taken over New York State). In issue #7, Brian O'Brien is revealed as the shadowy figure behind the Party.

(LDL) receptor (LDL-R) is a mosaic protein of 839 amino acids (after removal of 21-amino acid signal peptide) that mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL. It is a cell-surface receptor that recognizes the apoprotein B100, which is embedded in the outer phospholipid layer of LDL particles. The receptor also recognizes the apoE protein found in chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants (IDL). In humans, the LDL receptor protein is encoded by the LDLR gene on chromosome 19. It belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. It is most significantly expressed in bronchial epithelial cells and adrenal gland and cortex tissue. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein were awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their identification of LDL-R and its relation to cholesterol metabolism and familial hypercholesterolemia. The LDLR gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The LDLR gene resides on chromosome 19 at the band 19p13.2 and is split into 18 exons. Exon 1 contains a signal sequence that localises the receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum for transport to the cell surface. Beyond this, exons 2-6 code the ligand binding region; 7-14 code the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain; 15 codes the oligosaccharide rich region; 16 (and some of 17) code the membrane spanning region; and 18 (with the rest of 17) code the cytosolic domain. This gene produces 6 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = This protein belongs to the LDLR family and is made up of a number of functionally distinct domains, including 3 EGF-like domains, 7 LDL-R class A domains, and 6 LDL-R class B repeats. The N-terminal domain of the LDL receptor, which is responsible for ligand binding, is composed of seven sequence repeats (~50% identical). Each repeat, referred to as a class A repeat or LDL-A, contains roughly 40 amino acids, including 6 cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds within the repeat. Additionally, each repeat has highly conserved acidic residues which it uses to coordinate a single calcium ion in an octahedral lattice. Both the disulfide bonds and calcium coordination are necessary for the structural integrity of the domain during the receptor's repeated trips to the highly acidic interior of the endosome. The exact mechanism of interaction between the class A repeats and ligand (LDL) is unknown, but it is thought that the repeats act as \\"grabbers\\" to hold the LDL. Binding of ApoB requires repeats 2-7 while binding ApoE requires only repeat 5 (thought to be the ancestral repeat). Next to the ligand binding domain is an EGF precursor homology domain (EGFP domain). This shows approximately 30% homology with the EGF precursor gene. There are three \\"growth factor\\" repeats; A, B and C. A and B are closely linked while C is separated by the YWTD repeat region, which adopts a beta- propeller conformation (LDL-R class B domain). It is thought that this region is responsible for the pH-dependent conformational shift that causes bound LDL to be released in the endosome. A third domain of the protein is rich in O-linked oligosaccharides but appears to show little function. Knockout experiments have confirmed that no significant loss of activity occurs without this domain. It has been speculated that the domain may have ancestrally acted as a spacer to push the receptor beyond the extracellular matrix. The single transmembrane domain of 22 (mostly) non-polar residues crosses the plasma membrane in a single alpha helix. The cytosolic C-terminal domain contains ~50 amino acids, including a signal sequence important for localizing the receptors to clathrin-coated pits and for triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis after binding. Portions of the cytosolic sequence have been found in other lipoprotein receptors, as well as in more distant receptor relatives. = Mutations = Mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor are known to cause familial hypercholesterolaemia. There are 5 broad classes of mutation of the LDL receptor: * Class 1 mutations affect the synthesis of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). * Class 2 mutations prevent proper transport to the Golgi body needed for modifications to the receptor. **e.g. a truncation of the receptor protein at residue number 660 leads to domains 3,4 and 5 of the EGF precursor domain being missing. This precludes the movement of the receptor from the ER to the Golgi, and leads to degradation of the receptor protein. * Class 3 mutations stop the binding of LDL to the receptor. **e.g. repeat 6 of the ligand binding domain (N-terminal, extracellular fluid) is deleted. * Class 4 mutations inhibit the internalization of the receptor- ligand complex. **e.g. \\"JD\\" mutant results from a single point mutation in the NPVY domain (C-terminal, cytosolic; C residue converted to a Y, residue number 807). This domain recruits clathrin and other proteins responsible for the endocytosis of LDL, therefore this mutation inhibits LDL internalization. * Class 5 mutations give rise to receptors that cannot recycle properly. This leads to a relatively mild phenotype as receptors are still present on the cell surface (but all must be newly synthesised).  Function  LDL receptor mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL and thus maintains the plasma level of LDL. This occurs in all nucleated cells, but mainly in the liver which removes ~70% of LDL from the circulation. LDL receptors are clustered in clathrin-coated pits, and coated pits pinch off from the surface to form coated endocytic vesicles that carry LDL into the cell. After internalization, the receptors dissociate from their ligands when they are exposed to lower pH in endosomes. After dissociation, the receptor folds back on itself to obtain a closed conformation and recycles to the cell surface. The rapid recycling of LDL receptors provides an efficient mechanism for delivery of cholesterol to cells. It was also reported that by association with lipoprotein in the blood, viruses such as hepatitis C virus, Flaviviridae viruses and bovine viral diarrheal virus could enter cells indirectly via LDLR-mediated endocytosis. LDLR has been identified as the primary mode of entry for the Vesicular stomatitis virus in mice and humans. In addition, LDLR modulation is associated with early atherosclerosis-related lymphatic dysfunction. Synthesis of receptors in the cell is regulated by the level of free intracellular cholesterol; if it is in excess for the needs of the cell then the transcription of the receptor gene will be inhibited. LDL receptors are translated by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum and are modified by the Golgi apparatus before travelling in vesicles to the cell surface.  Clinical significance  In humans, LDL is directly involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the process responsible for the majority of cardiovascular diseases, due to accumulation of LDL-cholesterol in the blood . Hyperthyroidism may be associated with hypocholesterolemia via upregulation of the LDL receptor, and hypothyroidism with the converse. A vast number of studies have described the relevance of LDL receptors in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and steatohepatitis. Previously, rare mutations in LDL-genes have been shown to contribute to myocardial infarction risk in individual families, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with myocardial infarction risk in the population. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein C-III. Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk. Overall, LDLR has a high clinical relevance in blood lipids. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the LDLR gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

A part of the Fremont Street Experience, it is the oldest and smallest hotel (106 rooms) on the Fremont Street Experience. John F. Miller initially opened a temporary tent hotel ‚Äì the Miller Hotel ‚Äì on the property in 1905, while he planned to construct a permanent hotel structure, which opened as the Hotel Nevada on January 13, 1906. A casino operated within the hotel until a statewide gambling ban took effect in 1909. In 1931, the property was expanded and renamed as Sal Sagev (\\"Las Vegas\\" spelled backwards). The casino reopened that year when gambling in Nevada was legalized again. In 1955, the casino was renamed as the Golden Gate. The entire property was renamed as the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino in 1974. The Golden Gate was known for its cheap shrimp cocktails, served from 1959 to 2017. History =Early history (1905 ‚Äì 1974)= John F. Miller was among the first to come to Las Vegas in 1905. An auction for property in the city's future downtown area was held in May 1905. Miller purchased a $1,750 parcel at the southeast corner of Main Street and Fremont Street. On the property shortly thereafter, he established the Miller Hotel, a temporary tent hotel that was also known as the Hotel Nevada. In August 1905, Miller had plans to construct a permanent two-story hotel structure on the property. Construction on the new hotel was to begin as soon as the Kuhn Mercantile Company could vacate the property. In September 1905, the Miller Hotel became the first lodging establishment in Las Vegas to receive plumbing. In December 1905, plans were underway for a two-story retail and apartment building, to be constructed adjacent to the Hotel Nevada. The front of the new building was to be cemented to blend in with the hotel. Miller planned for the hotel to be modern, with amenities that included heating, electricity, and a telephone system. The two-story Hotel Nevada, located at 1 Fremont Street, opened on January 13, 1906, becoming the first hotel structure in Las Vegas, and the only concrete hotel in southern Nevada. The hotel rooms measured 10 feet square, cost $1 per day, and were referred to by a local newspaper as \\"first class\\". Due to the hotel's popularity, Miller announced in June 1906 that he would soon have a third story added to the property, expected to be finished by September 1, 1906. In October 1906, construction was underway on the addition, which consisted of brick and measured 20 feet by 30 feet. The addition added a kitchen and four bedrooms. In 1907, Las Vegas' first telephone was installed at the Hotel Nevada, with the number 1. The hotel's casino operated until 1909, when gambling was banned in Nevada. The casino's blackjack and poker tables were subsequently put into storage. By March 1918, Miller was considering a large addition to the hotel that would consist of reinforced concrete and would include 40 feet of frontage along Fremont Street. The hotel gained additional popularity beginning in 1925, when city officials had Fremont Street paved. The Hotel Nevada reopened its casino in 1931, when gambling in Nevada was legalized again. That year, the property was expanded to four stories and renamed as the Sal Sagev (Las Vegas spelled backwards). In July 1955, Abe Miller ‚Äì the property's longtime operator and the son of John F. Miller ‚Äì was approved for plans to lease the Sal Sagev's ground floor to a 23-man group, which would sublease the floor for $25,000 per month to eight Italian-American men, nearly all of them from Oakland, California. The eight men planned to open the Golden Gate casino on the ground floor of the Sal Sagev. Renovations on the new casino were underway that month and were being financed by the 23-man group, with an estimated cost of $330,000. Abe Miller was to receive $2,300 per month, as well as five percent of the gambling profits. The Golden Gate casino, named after the Golden Gate Bridge, opened on the ground floor later in 1955, while the hotel retained the Sal Sagev name. Italo Ghelfi, one of the eight partners, operated the casino for nearly 40 years. In February 1957, John F. Miller died during a nap at his apartment, located within the Sal Sagev hotel. He was 92 years old, and had experienced a substantial period of declining health. Abe Miller continued to operate the Sal Sagev into the 1960s. In 1964, the hotel was expanded to include a total of 106 rooms. In 1965, the hotel's exterior was covered in aluminum siding, which remained until its removal in 1990. As of 1969, Abe Miller operated the property with his sister, Helen Nugent. =Later years (1974 ‚Äì present)= In 1974, the entire property was renamed as the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino. Abe Miller and his sister had died by 1985, and his sister willed her small ownership of the property to nuns at The Convent of the Good Shepherd of Las Vegas. Ghelfi's family purchased the property from the partnership in 1990, and removed the metal-screen fa√ßade that had earlier been applied to the structure. The Golden Gate's 90th anniversary was marked by numerous celebrations in late May 1996, including Las Vegas mayor Jan Laverty Jones proclaiming it to be \\"Las Vegas' Most Historic Hotel.\\" Mid-2000s logo The 106-room, four-story hotel was renovated in 2005. By that time, the property was managed by Mark Brandenburg, Ghelfi's son. Brandenburg later became the owner. In March 2008, Brandenberg sold a 50% interest in the property to Desert Rock Enterprises, the investment company of Derek and Greg Stevens, who also owned the Las Vegas 51s baseball team and a 19% stake in the Riviera casino. With new money infused by the Stevens, the Golden Gate undertook casino upgrades and hotel room renovations. The following year, the Stevens raised their stake to 60%, and Derek took over as CEO, with Brandenburg as president. In 2010, a Du-par's restaurant opened inside the Golden Gate, replacing the Bay City Diner. Du-par's operated as a leased tenant of the Golden Gate. In 2012, the Golden Gate began its first major renovation in more than 50 years, gutting the old piano bar area and vintage hotel lobby area in favor of a more open and modern look, including scantily- clad women at the betting tables known as dancing dealers. The $12 million renovation includes a 35,000-square-foot, five-story hotel tower with 14 new suites and two penthouses, a new porte cochere, a new check-in and slot club desks, an expansion of the casino floor and a new high limit gaming area. Greg and Derek Stevens became full owners of Golden Gate in 2016.https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/stevens-to-acquire- remaining-35-percent-of-golden-gate/ On February 7, 2017, the Du-par's restaurant closed due to financial reasons, as it had been struggling with lease payments. It was owned by Biff Naylor, son of one of Golden Gate's original owners, Tiny Naylor. That month, construction began on an expansion to the Golden Gate's casino. The expansion would take Golden Gate's footprint into the space formerly occupied by the La Bayou casino. The Golden Gate closed around 2:00 a.m. on August 21, 2017, to allow for the multimillion- dollar renovation project, which had been planned for eight months. The project doubled the casino size and added 100 new slot machines. The project also added a new casino entrance, and extended the outdoor OneBar by 20 feet. The renovations occurred at the site of the former La Bayou as well as an alley that once separated the two casinos. The Golden Gate reopened 106 hours later, at 12:00 p.m. on August 25, 2017. The casino contains of space. Shrimp cocktail The famed Golden Gate shrimp cocktail as served in 2008. The Golden Gate was the first to serve a fifty cent shrimp cocktail in 1959, now a Las Vegas clich√©. The idea came from owner Italo Ghelfi, who based it on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.Ashley Powers, A jumbo Las Vegas deal doubles its price, Los Angeles Times, June 15, 2008, Accessed June 17, 2008. The Original Shrimp Cocktail consists of a regular-sized sundae glass filled with small salad shrimp and topped with a dollop of cocktail sauce. In 1991, the price was raised from 50¬¢ to 99¬¢, as the property was losing $300,000 a year on shrimp cocktails under the previous price. The price was raised in 2008 to $1.99. Until the 2012 renovations, there was a deli bar from which the shrimp cocktails were served. On April 26, 2008, the price on the famous shrimp cocktail rose to $1.99, due to a rise in fuel costs; it was the first increase in 17 years. Prior to the price increase, the casino lost about $300,000 a year on shrimp cocktails. As of October 26, 2012, the price stood at $2.99. As of August 2013, the price was $3.99. With the closure of the privately owned Du-par's restaurant, Golden Gate discontinued serving its shrimp cocktail. Derek Stevens, co-owner of Golden Gate, stated that the shrimp cocktail recipe is owned by the casino, and that it would return with the next restaurant concept to open at the hotel.

It operates at the link layer of the Internet model,RFC 1122 and is responsible for gathering various information required for internet communication, including the configuration of local connections and the domain name servers and gateways used to communicate with more distant systems.RFC 4861, Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6), T. Narten et al. (September 2007) The protocol defines five different ICMPv6 packet types to perform functions for IPv6 similar to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Router Discovery and Router Redirect protocols for IPv4. However, it provides many improvements over its IPv4 counterparts (RFC 4861, section 3.1). For example, it includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), thus improving robustness of packet delivery in the presence of failing routers or links, or mobile nodes. The Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) protocol extension (RFC 3122) allows nodes to determine and advertise an IPv6 address corresponding to a given link-layer address, similar to Reverse ARP for IPv4. The Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol (SEND), a security extension of NDP, uses Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) and the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to provide an alternative mechanism for securing NDP with a cryptographic method that is independent of IPsec. Neighbor Discovery Proxy (ND Proxy) (RFC 4389) provides a service similar to IPv4 Proxy ARP and allows bridging multiple network segments within a single subnet prefix when bridging cannot be done at the link layer. Functions NDP defines five ICMPv6 packet types for the purpose of router solicitation, router advertisement, neighbor solicitation, neighbor advertisement, and network redirects. ;Router Solicitation (Type 133): Hosts inquire with Router Solicitation messages to locate routers on an attached link. Routers which forward packets not addressed to them generate Router Advertisements immediately upon receipt of this message rather than at their next scheduled time. ;Router Advertisement (Type 134): Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a Router Solicitation message. ;Neighbor Solicitation (Type 135): Neighbor solicitations are used by nodes to determine the link layer address of a neighbor, or to verify that a neighbor is still reachable via a cached link layer address. ;Neighbor Advertisement (Type 136): Neighbor advertisements are used by nodes to respond to a Neighbor Solicitation message. ;Redirect (Type 137): Routers may inform hosts of a better first hop router for a destination. These messages are used to provide the following functionality: * Router discovery: hosts can locate routers residing on attached links. * Prefix discovery: hosts can discover address prefixes that are on-link for attached links. * Parameter discovery: hosts can find link parameters (e.g., MTU). * Address autoconfiguration: optional stateless configuration of addresses of network interfaces (see and ). * Address resolution: mapping between IP addresses and link-layer addresses. * Next-hop determination: hosts can find next-hop routers for a destination. * Neighbor unreachability detection (NUD): determine that a neighbor is no longer reachable on the link. * Duplicate address detection (DAD): nodes can check whether an address is already in use. * Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) and DNS Search List (DNSSL) assignment via a router advertisement (RA) options. This is a proposed standard since 2010 and updated in March 2017, but not supported by all clients. * Packet redirection to provide a better next-hop route for certain destinations.

On 14 May 2006 he succeeded Matthias Platzeck as chairman of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). He resigned from that post on 7 September 2008. On 28 September 2012 he announced his resignation from the post of minister-president. He was succeeded by social minister Malu Dreyer.Steinbr√ºck: We want to remove this governmenthttp://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/beck-hoert-als- ministerpraesident-und-spd-chef-in-rheinland-pfalz-auf-a-858667.html Following Peter Struck's death in 2012, Kurt Beck together with Dieter Schulte took chair of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Biography Beck was born in Bad Bergzabern, Rhineland-Palatinate, to the bricklayer Oskar Beck and his wife Johanna. Both his parents had their roots in the town Kapsweyer in southern Rhenish Palatinate. He grew up in Steinfeld. From 1963 to 1968, he became an electrician. After military duty in 1968 and 1969, he graduated from an evening school in 1972. Since then, he served as an employee representative on works councils. Political career Merkel and Beck (2007) After joining the SPD in 1972, mainly because of the Party's programme as well as the personality of Willy Brandt, Beck became chairman of the SPD of Rhineland Palatinate in 1993 and deputy chairman of the federal party in 2003. He served in this function until 14 May 2006. Beck has been active in local affairs since 1974, when he was first elected a member of the Kreistag. From 1989 to 1994, he was mayor of his hometown Steinfeld. From 1979, he was a directly elected member of the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate, in which he served as the speaker for social affairs of the Parliamentary group of the SPD (from 1982 to 1985) and as a member of the governing body of the group from 1985 to 1991, when he was elected chairman. =Minister-President of Rhineland- Palatinate, 1994‚Äì2013= On 26 October 1994 Kurt Beck was elected Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate, succeeding Rudolf Scharping. He was re- elected three times, in 1996, 2001 and 2006. As Minister President he was known for his centrist approach, which is also apparent from the choice of his coalition partner (the liberal FDP instead of the left-wing Green Party, with which the SPD has recently allied itself). In this respect, he follows the policy of Scharping. In March 2006, Beck's SPD gained an absolute majority in the state elections; Beck offered to continue the coalition but since the FDP declined, the SPD formed a government without a partner. After Edmund Stoiber resigned in 2007, Beck was the senior Minister President in Germany. During his time in office, Beck's decisions in Rhineland-Palatinate to increase efficiency in the state government via administrative reorganisation, and to introduce full-day schooling and free kindergartens, drew national attention. The state also emerged as one of the country‚Äôs top economic performers.Hugh Williamson (May 12, 2006), Doubts surround SPD‚Äôs down-to-earth new leader Financial Times.

It is less sedating than older antihistamines. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied and use when breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking histamine H1-receptors. Levocetirizine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions.  Medical uses  Levocetirizine is used for allergic rhinitis. This includes allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hives, and itching.  Side effects  Levocetirizine is called a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts, and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. Cardiac safety with repolarization may be better than some other antihistamines, as levocetirizine does not significantly prolong the QT interval in healthy individuals. However, some people may still experience some slight sleepiness, headache, mouth dryness, lightheadedness, vision problems (mainly blurred vision), palpitations and fatigue.XOZAL technical specifications booklet.  Pharmacology  Levocetirizine is an antihistamine. It acts as an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increase the blood supply to the area, and provides relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever.  Chemistry  Chemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary enantiomer of cetirizine, also called the l-enantiomer of cetirizine. It is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines.  History  Levocetirizine was first launched in 2001 by Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB.  Society and culture  = Availability = On 31 January 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved an over-the-counter version. Although the drug was authorized by the FDA in 2007, it was already available in most European countries. Like many new drugs it entered the market at a higher price than currently available third and second generation antihistamines. In India, one form of the drug is available as Crohist MK tablets and syrup, a formulation of levocetirizine hydrochloride and montelukast. In India, Crohist MK is a Schedule 'H' drug and may only be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner. = Brand names = Different brands (Actavis, Glenmark, UCB) Levocetirizine tablets and oral solution.

After transferring across the lunar samples and other equipment, Falcon was jettisoned. It would fire its rocket engine to cause it to impact the lunar surface. Apollo 15 spent one more day in lunar orbit, continuing Worden's observations. After releasing a subsatellite, they ignited their service propulsion system to put them on a trajectory back to Earth. The next day, Worden performed an EVA to retrieve the film cassettes from the scientific instrument module (SIM) bay cameras. The twelfth day in space was uneventful, with Mission Control holding a press conference where the astronauts were asked questions submitted by the news media. On their 13th and final day they prepared for reentry. During descent one of their three parachutes failed, and they splashed down successfully with only two. Rendezvous and docking Falcon lifted off from the lunar surface at 171 hours, 37 minutes and 16 seconds GET. During ascent from the Moon, Worden played \\"The Air Force Song\\". Although he thought it was only being played for Houston, unbeknownst to him, a switch had been flicked in Mission Control that relayed his voice transmissions to the LM. It is understood that Scott was not very happy with this, as it was impossible to make out any communications from Mission Control while the song played. Apollo 15's LM Falcon as seen by the CSM Endeavour, during rendezvous. The object in the foreground is the EVA floodlight. The LM was placed into a 42 by 9 nm (77.8 by 16.7 km) orbit. Apollo 15 would be the first direct rendezvous, where the two craft would rendezvous within one orbit. The LM orbit was not perfectly in the same plane as the CSM's, so another burn of the LM's ascent engine was required. During the following near side pass, the spacecraft continued to close, with Falcon, in its lower orbit, catching Endeavour. Once about 120 feet (40 m) apart the spacecraft started to station-keep -- keeping the distance between them constant. As on all Apollo flights, the crew extensively photographed and filmed this process. Endeavour closed in to hard dock and the mission of Falcon had come to an end. Apollo 15's CSM Endeavour as seen by from the LM Falcon, during rendezvous After opening the hatches, the crew began the task of transferring the rock samples that had been collected on the surface. Scott and Irwin also vacuumed their spacesuits to try to rid them of as much dust as possible. Also transferred were film magazines, food, used urine and fecal bags (they were included for medical investigators). One Oxygen Purge System (OPS) was also transferred. On the lunar surface the OPS would be used as an emergency oxygen supply, or by the crew of the LM in the event that they were unable to achieve hard docking with the CSM and had to undertake an EVA to transfer across from the LM. Worden would use it during his EVA later in the mission. Following the completion of the transfer, the crew resealed the hatches between the two craft and prepared to jettison the LM. This was different from the undocking that took place before landing. In this case it would be an explosive jettison as much of the docking probe structure was now unneeded and will stay in the LM. There was some difficulty in getting the tunnel between the craft to depressurize. This suggested that there was an improperly sealed hatch, delaying the separation by one orbit. After checking the hatches the crew could not find a cause for the improper seal, but the tunnel now vented successfully. In his 2001 memoir, Flight Director Christopher Kraft wrote that some of these difficulties may have been the result of crew fatigue. Because of the longer lunar stay time, by this point Scott and Irwin had gone an arduous 22 hours without sleep, and both men had experienced some heart irregularities on the lunar surface after their EVAs. Kraft wrote that coordination between ground controllers and the crew broke down several times at this point in the mission, and he recalled this as one of the most stressful experiences during his career in mission control. A change in crew procedure had come after the deaths of three crewmembers of Soyuz 11 less than a month before the launch of Apollo 15. On Soyuz 11 the crew had been killed after a repressurization valve opened during the separation of the orbital and service modules from the reentry module of the Soyuz spacecraft. Mission planners for Apollo 15 decided that the crew should now wear their pressure suits during the separation of the LM from the CSM, something that had not previously occurred. The suits caused some problems for 15 as during an integrity test before the tunnel venting they were unable to achieve suit integrity in Scott's suit. After finally jettisoning the LM, the CSM performed a small RCS burn to further separate from the LM. Falcon was directed to burn its ascent stage engine, so that it would impact the lunar surface. The delay has meant it would not impact in the planned site, instead impacting at 26¬∞12' N, 0¬∞6' E, about 56 miles (90 km) from the landing site. The crew should have started their sleep period, but due to the delays now had to finish housekeeping chores. Mainly these centered around turning back on the SIM instruments which had been turned off during the rendezvous and docking and orientating the spacecraft for their proper use. Just before the sleep period, Deke Slayton, who was effectively the astronauts' boss, radioed the crew and told them to take a Seconal sedative. The crew decided against this. Doctors on the ground had become worried when they saw that Scott's and Irwin's EKG had developed a bigeminy rhythm. Caused by a lack of potassium, the ventricles beat in couplets, instead of a single constant beat. The potassium deficiency is thought to have been caused by the training schedule and stress of the flight. Irwin would later die in 1991 of a heart attack. Finally 3¬Ω hours after they were meant to go to sleep and 2 hours after Mission Control first said good night to the crew, they started their sleep period on the 54th orbit of the Moon. Scott and Irwin had been awake over 23 hours and Worden 21 hours. Last day in lunar orbit and TEI Earthrise as seen by the crew of Apollo 15 near the end of their mission Apollo 15 spent one final day in lunar orbit before trans-Earth injection (TEI), the SPS burn that would put them on a trajectory back to Earth. This day was spent mainly on the same tasks that had occupied Worden during the past four days. Mission Control decided to make many changes to the flight plan. The Laser Altimeter failed and was declared a lost cause. The crew were asked to use a 250 mm telephoto lens instead of an 80 mm lens on the Hasselblad. They were also instructed to take as many photographs as they liked. There was no point in them returning to Earth carrying unexposed film. Among their photographic targets were the terminator region, where the Sun would appear to be either rising or setting for an observer on the ground. These photographs were extremely useful as they showed surface features in strong relief. Now, with three persons on board, the crew were able to acquire many more handheld photographs, with one person always available to run the SIM and receive flight plan updates from Mission Control. The crew were also instructed to just turn on the Panoramic Camera and let it run now that all its primary targets had been imaged. As Apollo 15 appeared from behind the Moon on its 73rd orbit, there were only two more orbits left before TEI. During this time the crew had to release the subsatellite and prepare for the rocket burn that would send them home. Like all parts of the CSM and LM, the SPS was highly redundant. The only parts that were not were the engine bell and the combustion chamber. The subsatellite The subsatellite was designed to measure the gravitational field of the Moon and investigate the Earth and Moon's magnetospheres. It was 31 inches (79 cm) long, with a 14-inch (36 cm) hexagonal body. Weighing a total of 78.5 pounds (35.6 kg), it was powered by solar cells for daytime operations and a silver-cadmium battery for the nighttime. It had three booms that extended after release, which were 5 ft (1.5 m) long. Before releasing the subsatellite, the crew performed another engine burn to raise their orbit. This was designed to allow the subsatellite to last longer. The three-second burn raised their orbit from 65.4 by 52.2 nautical miles (121.1 by 96.7 kilometres) to 76.0 by 54.3 nautical miles (140.8 by 100.6 km). In this new orbit it was expected that the subsatellite would survive for one year. The Moon as Apollo 15 travels back to Earth. Mare Australe is in the center. The crater Humboldt is in the lower center. Near the top on the terminator Vallis Schr√∂dinger is visible, with Sikorsky crater cutting across it. As they began their 74th and final orbit of the Moon, the crew positioned the spacecraft for the correct attitude for release. The subsatellite was released on schedule. The release process involved two pyrotechnic bolts being fired to release the satellite which was launched using a spring-loaded mechanism, a pin in a curved groove to impart a spin in the satellite. The spinning helped to stabilise the craft. After having the information needed to burn the SPS to send them home radioed from Mission Control, Apollo 15 disappeared behind the Moon for the last time. Igniting on time, the SPS burned for 2 minutes, 21 seconds, adding 3,050 ft/s (930 m/s) to their speed. Little was left for the crew to do on their tenth day in space. They continued to photograph the lunar surface as it receded from them, using up the remaining film. And now they were back in the constant sunlight of cis- lunar space, they put the spacecraft into PTC. Day 11 and EVA The main task on the eleventh day in space was an EVA by Worden. This was the first EVA by a Command Module Pilot since Scott performed one on Apollo 9. As the crew began their preparations, they left the Lunar Sphere of Influence at 238 hours, 14 minutes, 51 seconds GET, at which point the gravitational pull of the Earth was stronger than that of the Moon. From now on they would start to accelerate towards the Earth. After retracting and turning off the equipment in the SIM bay, the crew donned their space suits. They disabled the RCS thrusters that were near the SIM and if accidentally fired would have been dangerous to Worden. Guards were also placed over the control panel to ensure that switches were not flicked by an errant foot. After suit checks and depressurizing the spacecraft, the hatch was opened. After mounting a TV and film camera on the hatch, Worden jettisoned two bags of rubbish that did not need to be returned to Earth. Then using handholds built into the craft he moved along to the SIM bay. Along with retrieval he was tasked with inspecting the instruments to find the cause for the various problems experienced with them. Al Worden during his EVA to retrieve film from cameras in the SIM bay. This is a frame from the a 16 mm film shot by Jim Irwin from the hatch. First he retrieved the film cassette from the Panoramic Camera and returned that to the cabin. After inspecting the \\"V-over-H\\" sensor on the Mapping Camera he retrieved its film cassette. He found that there was nothing obscuring the sensor as had been postulated by Mission Control as a cause for its problems. Later analysis would find that the problem was related to the optical signal- to-noise ratio. As the other instruments had radioed their data back to Earth, there were nothing else to collect. Twenty minutes after opening the hatch, it was closed and locked again. The SIM bay was turned back on so that the X-ray Spectrometer could be pointed at Scorpius X-1 and Cygnus X-1. Day 12 During the night, the crew set a new space endurance record for the Apollo program (though not for all spaceflight with Gemini 7 having stayed in space for 14 days, and Soyuz 11 for a month). The twelfth day in space for the crew was one of the quietest. As on all Apollo lunar flights, on the return trip there was little left to do, with the main objectives already accomplished. The crew undertook another light flash experiment, this time keeping the cabin lights on to see if this affected the visibility. They found that they were less visible. Mission Control ran over the stowage of items in the cabin. It was extremely important that stowed items were placed such that the spacecraft's center of gravity was within the set limits. Especially important were items like the rock samples weighing 170 lb (77 kg) and the 55 lb (25 kg) film cassettes from the panoramic camera. The Earth bound portion of the flight coincided with a lunar eclipse. This occurs when the Moon passes through the shadow of the Earth. The crew was instructed to photograph it but due to the hand-held nature of the cameras and the length of the exposures, most of the photos were blurred. Instruments on the lunar surface left by the crew also recorded the eclipse, though only through noting the drop of the surface temperature by 185 kelvins. The crew also conducted an in-flight press conference, with questions having been submitted by members of the press to be read by the CAPCOM. First they were asked what was the event that would like to repeat and any they would not like to. Scott responded that looking down on the plain from Hadley Delta was for him the best moment. For Worden it was LOI, and their first close up views of the Moon and TEI, which meant they were coming home. Irwin enjoyed the launch the most, but would not like to repeat falling down in front of the TV camera while deploying the rover. Most of the questions centered around the surface operations, such what to the crew were the most important findings. Irwin responded that to him it was the \\"organization that was revealed in the side of Mount Hadley\\". Scott was asked to describe what it was like to land Falcon. He said that the cratering on the surface was much more subtle than expected making landmark sighting harder. Scott was also asked about the physical workload of doing three 7 hour EVAs. He said that he saw no problem with it and praised their training on the Earth before the mission in preparing them for all possible events. The rover was of interest, with Irwin describing it as a bucking bronco that at times only had two wheels still touching the surface. Scott said that he felt it was a very stable machine that in the 1/6 gravity had a tendency to float a bit. Scott was also asked about the drill which he had much trouble with. He said that after about a meter below the surface he ran into hard rock that he was unable to drill through easily. Although he and Irwin had great difficulty extracting the core sample, he felt it was worthwhile. Scott answered a question about the loss of the North Complex by saying that in terms of the original mission objectives, the North Complex was not even mentioned and was only added later. Although personally disappointed, it would have been more of a bonus. As always there were questions related to what the American taxpayer was getting out of the mission except for some \\"pretty television pictures\\". Scott said that man must explore and that along with huge amounts of scientific data, there was the great sense of exploration that came from the flight. Worden and Irwin agreed totally with these sentiments. When asked about the problems on board, the crew thought that they had a very smooth flight except for some popped circuit breakers and the problem with the SPS thrust switch. Irwin said that \\"it seemed like a very tame simulation\\". When asked to describe his geological observations from orbit, Worden talked about the cinder cones he had seen and how many of the craters they observed, especially on the far side seemed to have been filled by lava flows. The press were also interested in what a man thinks about when he is alone for three days. He responded that with the flight plan there was little time to sit back and think. The three days seemed to go very quickly for him. When asked why on his EVA he had come in so soon, he said that he didn't come in soon, he just came in when the job was finished. The sixth course correction was canceled after the press conference. The TEI had the spacecraft on such a good trajectory that it was thought that no further trims were needed. Scott, Irwin, and Worden began their final sleep period at 278 hours. Reentry After awaking on their final day in space, the crew shut down the SIM bay for the last time. The gamma-ray spectrometer boom was stowed and all the equipment was made safe. Along with the rest of the service module it would burn up as it reentered the Earth's atmosphere. The final midcourse correction of the mission (MCC-7) or the corridor control burn, was a 21 s RCS thruster, slowing them down by 5.6 ft/s (1.7 m/s). Now all that was left for them to do was separate from the service module and assume the blunt-end-forward orientation. The CM's own RCS system was pressurized and the VHF radio link checked. VHF would be used after passing through the radio communications blackout of reentry. The separation from the SM was a highly important event. First, a series of pyrotechnic systems were armed; a switch was then flicked to initiate separation. From here an automatic system took over. A timer was started to have the RCS thrusters fire to increase the separation. The electrical connections between the two craft were severed using cannon-style plug and socket connectors that were ejected using small pyrotechnic charges. A pyro-powered guillotine severed the wire bundles and plumbing. Further charges severed tension ties that connected the two modules, which were then pushed apart using springs. After entering the atmosphere, the acceleration built, peaking at 6 g (59 m/s¬≤). This dropped as they slowed down, coming out of radio blackout. Passing through 7,300 metres (24,000 ft), the apex cover was blown by a pyrotechnic charge. This exposed the two sets of parachutes. First the two drogue parachutes were released, which slowed and stabilized the capsule from 500 km/h to 280 km/h. They pulled out the three large main parachutes some twenty seconds later. The capsule of Apollo 15 descends under only two good parachutes. The recovery forces in the area reported that only two of the main parachutes had inflated. Worden said after splashdown that all three parachutes did inflate properly at first but after dumping the RCS fuel (highly toxic hydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide), he noticed that one was not inflated anymore. Post flight analysis would find that two or three of the six shroud lines on the failed parachute were missing. Although no conclusive cause was found, it is thought that the loss of the shroud lines was due to the RCS fuel dump. The splashdown point was estimated to be , 330 statute miles (530 km) north of Honolulu, Hawaii and 5.3 n mi (9.8 km) from the prime recovery ship, the USS Okinawa. The loss of a parachute was of no consequence for the capsule, which was designed to land safely on just two parachutes, the third parachute being a redundancy in case one parachute had failed. After splashing down the capsule stayed upright, which meant their recovery was not delayed while it righted itself. Frogmen from the Okinawa were at the capsule within minutes attaching a sea anchor and opening the hatch to get the crew into a life raft. Apollo 15 was the first mission where the crew did not go into quarantine in case of any lunar microorganisms, after it was found from previous flights that the Moon was lifeless. They were flown to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. From there they were flown in a Lockheed JetStar to Ellington Air Force Base, Houston.

It was written in Mossgiel in 1785 and published in the Kilmarnock volume in 1786. The poem was written as a humorous portrayal of the Devil and the pulpit oratory of the Presbyterian Church. It begins by quoting from Milton's Paradise Lost as a contrast with the first two lines of the poem itself: These lines are also a parody of a couplet in Alexander Pope's satire The Dunciad. The poem was written in a Habbie stanza with the stanza six lines long and the rhyme scheme AAABAB. Burns used a similar stanza in Death and Doctor Hornbrook.

They collected a total of of lunar surface material during 18¬Ω hours outside the Lunar Module Falcon.Map of Mare Imbrium. The Apollo 15 landing site is marked \\"J\\". Landing At 104 hours, 30 minutes and 12 seconds GET the descent engine of Falcon ignited. Burning at about 10% for the first 26 seconds so that the guidance computer could gimbal the engine to direct the thrust through the center of gravity of the LM, it then thrust up to 100%. Irwin confirmed that the Abort Guidance System (AGS) agreed with the Primary Guidance and Navigation System (PGNS) on their height and rate of descent. At three minutes the computer rolled the spacecraft so that they were now on their back, with the windows facing away from the lunar surface. This was so the landing radar could acquire the surface. Scott then announced the altitude and velocity lights, indicating the computer was getting acceptable data from the radar. Six minutes into the burn they were 30,000 feet (9000 m) above the surface. In Mission Control, the Flight Director learned that tracking data indicated they were going to land 3000 feet (900 m) south of the targeted landing site. Although at first he decided not to tell the crew, Ed Mitchell, the CapCom, convinced him otherwise. During this time Scott was trying to see the ground through his window. He thought they were going to land as long as he could see Mount Hadley Delta. He was unable to see the Rille, something that had been possible in the simulators. Falcon on the Plain at Hadley. Irwin took this photo from that ALSEP at the start of the third EVA. It shows the decided lean of the LM. Nine minutes and ten seconds into the burn, Program 64 started on the computer and the LM pitched forward and the crew could see the ground. Using scribe marks on the window and angles read to him by Irwin, Scott found where the computer was predicting the landing site to be and then used a hand controller to move the predicted location. He did this 18 times during the landing, moving the target site a total of 338 meters (1110 feet) uprange and 409 meters (1341 feet) north. Scott's main problem was that there was very little detail on the surface. The best images of the site only had 66 ft (20 m) resolution and photoanalysers had overenhanced the images. The main problem was overestimating the depth of craters, so as to make them have shadows at higher sun angles. Fortunately he was able to see four craters, Matthew, Mark, Luke and Index (the reason it was called Index and not John was due to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an outspoken atheist who had sued NASA over the reading of Genesis during Apollo 8. Although she lost the case, NASA remained squeamish on overtly religious announcements on later flights). Irwin began reading the altitude, rate of descent and the projected landing site. At 400 ft (120 m), the computer was switched to Program 66, designed for the landing phase. From now on Scott was flying manually. Irwin stopped reading out the projected landing site. Passing through 120 ft (37 m) Scott said he was picking up some dust. By the time they got to between 60 and 50 ft (18 to 15 m) the view outside would be completely obscured by dust. Irwin then announced that the contact light had illuminated, indicating one of the landing probes on the LM's feet had contacted the ground. Immediately Scott cut the engine. With the extended engine bell there was a fear that it could touch the ground and cause exhaust to travel back into the engine. It is estimated that they were travelling 6.8 ft/s (2 m/s) when they hit, twice as fast as previous missions. A few seconds later, Scott informed the ground that \\"Okay, Houston. The Falcon is on the Plain at Hadley.\\" Falcon was tilted nearly 10 degrees to its back left, just 5¬∞ below the maximum acceptable angle. It set down on the rim of a crater such that its engine bell was damaged, and with one of the legs in the crater. They were about 600 meters north and about 175 meters west of the targeted landing site. This was of little concern though thanks to the capabilities of the rover. Stand-up EVA Silver Spur as seen by a telephoto image. It was named after Leon Silver. Before they ventured outside for the first time, Scott and Irwin would sleep. Both had realized that in order to be at their best for their seven-hour Extra-vehicular activity they would need to be rested. But Scott had also learned the need to get an overview of a new survey site before venturing outside. As such he convinced mission planners to let them conduct a stand-up EVA before the first sleep period. It also gave them a stable platform to use a 500 mm telephoto lens that was carried on this mission for the first time. The lens had been a struggle to get on board a spacecraft where weight savings were measured in pounds. Two hours after landing, they depressurized the LM and removed the top hatch and docking mechanism. Then, Scott stood on top of the ascent engine cover and put his head outside. Looking around, Scott was familiar with the territory having spent months studying maps of the area. He could easily recognize Mons Hadley, Mons Hadley Delta, the Swan Range, the Silver Spur, Bennett Hill, Hill 305, and the North Complex. Scott's first task was to take a 22-picture stereo panorama of the area using a 60 mm lens. Then he photographed targets of interest with the telephoto lens, and then a color panorama of the area with the 60 mm lens. He was able to put to bed any further concerns about the use of the Rover. Radar observations from Earth had given the impression that the area was covered in large boulders that would make it impossible to traverse with the Rover. Scott saw that there was nothing bigger than 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) near them. He then described the features he could see around him. Basically this was to give a general setting of the area and make sure there were no great surprises. Thirty minutes after opening the hatch, Scott re-entered and the hatch was closed and Falcon repressurized. EVA-1 The traverses undertaken by Dave Scott and Jim Irwin during Apollo 15. Throughout the astronauts' sleep period, Mission Control had watched with some concern as the pressure inside descent stage oxygen tanks of the LM slowly dropped. To conserve power during the night, the LM was run on a low-data-rate telemetry stream, so Mission Control could not tell the exact cause. Unwilling to wake the crew they decided to wait until they had woken up. In the end, Flight Director Peter Frank chose to wake the crewmen an hour early and got them to turn back on the high-data-rate telemetry. With this they saw that the valve of the Urine Transfer Device was open even though the receptacle was capped. A total of about 8 out of 95 pounds (3.6 out of 43 kg) of oxygen had been lost. About half of the total amount was reserve. Scott and Irwin would state in the post- flight Technical Debrief that Mission Control should have awakened them as soon as the leak was detected. Once they were awake, it was decided to start their preparations for the first lunar EVA of their mission. As with everything in Apollo, it was an involved procedure. Not only did they have to prepare Falcon, but had to don their space suits. Apollo 15 was the first crew that got to sleep in long johns rather than having to stay in their space suits. It would not be until four hours after waking up that Mission Control gave the Go to depressurize the LM. As Scott became the seventh man to step onto the lunar surface, he said: > As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of > realize there's a fundamental truth to our nature. Man must explore. And > this is exploration at its greatest. After inspecting the LM, Scott began to unpack the Modularised Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), which was attached to the side of the LM and carried the Apollo TV camera, sample bags, batteries, CO2 scrubbers for the space suits, and other equipment needed while the astronauts were outside the spacecraft. About seven minutes after Scott stepped outside Irwin is on the surface. Irwin working at the Rover at the end of the first EVA Irwin's first task was to collect a contingency sample of lunar rock. This was collected in case of an emergency, i.e., suddenly having to leave the lunar surface within the first few minutes. In such an event having a contingency sample meant that the crew would not return to Earth empty-handed. However, the contingency sample was not of much value because the ground surrounding the landing site had been disturbed by the LM descent engine. After Scott positioned the TV camera on a tripod so Mission Control could see the deployment of the Lunar Rover, he and Irwin began the process by pulling on two lanyards. These released the Rover and let it swing down on hinges. As it did, it began to unfold. They experienced some problems at first due to the angle the LM was sitting on, but within minutes it was on the ground almost ready to go. Scott had the honor of the first test drive, taking it around the LM. The Rover had both front and back steering, but Scott found that only the rear-wheel steering was working (mysteriously the front steering would be working at the start of the second EVA). Other difficulties came from how their space suits did not bend very much when they sat down. When training on Earth, their body weight had forced the suits down, but on the Moon, they ended up reclining in the seats. Apart from the steering there were no other problems and the crew set about loading up the Rover for their first geological traverse. During lunar surface operations, Commander Scott always drove the rover, while Lunar Module Pilot Irwin was a passenger who assisted with navigation. This division of responsibilities between the two crew positions was used consistently throughout Apollo's J missions. The astronauts could not travel any farther than the distance they could walk with the remaining oxygen in their Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS). So the earlier they set out, the farther they could travel. They would travel to the farthest point of the traverse and then work their way back. On EVA-1 they would travel to the base of Hadley Delta via the Rille. Their first target was the crater dubbed Elbow crater, so- called as it sat at a bend in the Rille. The first EVA also served an important task of working out exactly where they had landed. The Rover carried a navigation system that could calculate the distance and direction of a known starting point. By travelling to a known point this could be calibrated. Scott set off at 9 km/h (6 mph), slow by terrestrial standards, but due to the lowness of the chassis of the Rover and the roughness of the surface, the astronauts would say it seemed quite quick. Throughout the journey, the astronauts had trouble identifying where they were. Due to not knowing exactly where the landing site was and over-enhanced maps, little was familiar. But the route chosen for this first drive had been picked with this in mind. By driving along the side of the rille it would be hard to miss their target. After arriving at Elbow, Irwin's first task was to take a panorama of the site. At the same time Scott aligned the S-band antenna of the Rover with the Earth. This allowed Mission Control to operate the TV camera. Ed Fendell was in charge of controlling the camera and took his own pan so geologists in the backroom could see the site. The backroom kept track of everything that astronauts did on geology. As a sample was collected they would note its number, location and description on a card. Dave Scott bent over the rock at Station 2. In the foreground is the 6-meter crater. Scott and Irwin took a radial sample of the crater, taking samples at increasing distances in a straight line from the rim of the crater. After placing the photocalibration gnomon to the west of each sample, it was photographed, before being collected and placed into a numbered bag. Within ten minutes they had gathered four rock samples and it was time to move onto Station 2 -- St George. Five hundred meters south of Elbow was the 3 km wide St. George crater. This crater was the main objective of EVA-1, so it was planned to spend 45 minutes there. The flight plan had called for them to use the crater as a way of investigating the interior of Hadley Delta by collecting its ejecta. But as they approached they found there was no ejecta so it was decided not to bother visiting the rim of St George. Instead they travelled to a boulder sitting in the open by a 6-meter crater. Taken at the double-core site by Irwin. It shows the view up the rille toward the northwest. Scott is at the Rover and the gnomon is on the ground at his right foot. Scan by Kipp Teague. The rock they stopped at was about 5 feet (1.5 m) across. The larger a rock is, the more likely it was formed in the area, instead of being thrown there by an impact. Firstly they took a soil sample at the base of the rock, then another from a small depression down the hill a bit. Scott announced that after this they would roll the rock over and sample the soil from underneath it. After a couple of futile attempts they managed to chip some pieces off it. In A Man on the Moon Andrew Chaikin writes that Dale Jackson of USGS was having dinner with some astronauts that night in Houston and happily proclaimed that \\"they did everything but fuck that rock.\\" Other samples in the area were made using a specially designed rake with tines spaced 1 cm apart to collect small pebbles from the regolith. The last task at Station 2 was to take a core sample. This was done using a tube driven into the ground by a hammer. Mission Control announced that it had decided to cancel a planned stop at a crater named Flow due to time constraints. Thus the astronauts boarded the Rover and drove back past Elbow and on their way to the LM. About 125 meters before a crater named Rhysling, Scott spied a large piece of vesicular basalt sitting by itself. Not wanting to just leave it there, he stopped the Rover. The stop was unplanned so he just told Mission Control his seatbelt had come loose, but quickly got off the Rover, ran over to the rock, using his collection tongs for a calibration in the photos, took a sample and got back to the Rover. During this time, Irwin distracted Mission Control by describing the surrounding craters. It was not until the sample boxes returned to Earth that the stop was discovered. The vesicular basalt is sample 15016, and it is sometimes called the seatbelt basalt. Back at Falcon, Scott and Irwin set about deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). Scott would drill the holes for the heat-flow experiment and put in the probes, while Irwin would set up the rest of the equipment. The ALSEP consisted of the passive seismic experiment, lunar surface magnetometer, solar wind spectrometer, suprathermal ion detector, cold cathode gauge experiment, lunar dust detector and the heat- flow experiment. Not included in the ALSEP but deployed by Irwin as well were the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (LRRR) and the Solar Wind Composition Experiment. The ALSEP equipment was attached via cables to the Central Station powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Scott had major trouble with the drilling. The first 40 cm were easy, but from then on it became more and more difficult. After 1.6 m, half of what was planned, he could get no further and Mission Control told him to just emplace the probes and start on the next hole. The extreme torque had locked the chuck meaning it had to be freed with a wrench, further delaying him. He could only get 1 meter into the ground on the second hole before Mission Control called it a day and told them to return to the LM. They had been outside for 6¬Ω hours. Returning to the LM gave the crew a much-needed rest. Irwin was dehydrated as his water bag had not worked, and he had gone over seven hours without liquids. EVA-2 The target of the second EVA was Mount Hadley Delta again, but the crew drove via a more direct route and to a site east of where they had travelled the previous day. Travelling at 5.5 mph (9 km/h) they made good time across the plain. The first stop of the day, Station 4 was cancelled to give them more time to finish the drilling the holes for the heat flow experiment. This was at Dune crater, on the western edge of the South Cluster. The astronauts would, however, briefly visit Dune on the return trip to the LM. After making a navigation stop at Spur, they started to travel the 1.9 mi (3 km) along the base of the Delta to reach Station 5, at a site named Front. Scott found there was little variation in the surroundings and decided that Front was going to offer little difference, so it was decided to stop at a site about 1.9 mi (3 km) from St George and 320 ft (100 m) up to the Delta. It was interesting work, with the slope being about 10 degrees. Not reaching Front cancelled Station 5, placing them instead at Station 6. ALSEP. Dune crater is in the foreground and the hills of the North Complex are beyond Falcon. They first sampled a fresh-looking 1-meter crater, that was part of the rim of the older 3-meter crater. More samples were made above the area where they had parked the Rover. Most were breccias, but they did find one porphyritic basalt. Scott decided to move down to a 40 ft (12 m) crater, which was the largest one nearby. He went down inside it to sample, but found most of the rocks to be too large. Mission Control called up and said they would like the crew to dig a trench to study the soil mechanics and take a core sample. Irwin dug the trench, which Scott photographed. Then the core sample was taken from inside the crater. Returning to the Rover, they drove 650 ft (200 m) to a large boulder. Even walking short distances on the slope was time consuming so it was easier to just have the crew use the Rover to get there. The boulder was 10 ft (3 m) across. It was necessary for one crewmember to stay by the Rover, holding it to make sure it did not slide down the hill, which now had a 15-degree slope. With time running out on the stop, Scott was able to confirm what Irwin had seen earlier -- the rock had a greenish tinge. The color was found to come from magnesium oxide. Back on the Rover, they traveled onward to Spur crater, which was 320 ft (100 m) across and 66 ft (20 m) deep. Reaching the crater's rim they found small fragments, including one with a white vein. At first Irwin thought he had kicked up some green soil, but Scott found it was just caused by the visors of the helmets which were coated gold. It was then that they saw what would become the most famous lunar sample collected during the entire Apollo program -- sample #15415 or as it was dubbed by the media, the \\"Genesis Rock\\". It looked at first just like a partially crystalline rock, but the closer they looked they realized it was almost pure plagioclase, meaning it was anorthosite. It was originally thought they had found a piece of the Moon's primordial crust, but later analysis would show that the rock was only 4.1 ¬± 0.1 billion years old, which is younger than the Moon itself, and was formed after the Moon's crust solidified. But it was still an extremely old sample, and was from the pre-Imbrian era. With time running out, and the walk-back constraint approaching, the geology backroom decided that they wanted the astronauts to collect as many small fragments as they could from the area. Irwin had wanted to sample a large breccia but after spending so much time on #15415, there was little time left at the site. They also took some rake samples, netting 78 fragments from the regolith. With only three minutes before they had to move on, Irwin hit a large rock with his scoop, breaking it along one of its fracture lines. The chip they collected would be the second-largest rock collected on the mission. They returned to Falcon along essentially the same path as they came. Passing the South Cluster and Dune, Scott decided to stop and collect some samples. Joe Allen, the CapCom, warned them that they only had ten minutes to spend here. Irwin's camera jammed after acquiring a panorama of the area, forcing Scott to take all the remaining documentation photography. Working quickly, they collected samples, including several from a large basalt boulder on the rim of Dune. On returning to the LM, Scott began another attempt at drilling holes for the heat-flow experiment. Irwin took some manual core samples from around the ALSEP site. Again like the previous day the drill continued to get stuck, refusing to go any further. Scott was able to advance a few centimeters by pulling the drill up to clear the flutes on the drill bit and then letting the drill advance only using its own weight. This process however would cause the drill bit sections to come apart, meaning that what Scott was really doing was creating a new obstruction below the surface without realizing it. When he tried to emplace the probes they only went in 3 ft (1 m). Post-flight analysis would find that the drill design was flawed, with the flutes too close together at the joint joining the sections of the stem. A soil mechanics experiment was undertaken by digging a trench and using a penetrometer to measure the strength of the regolith. Scott began drilling another hole, this time for a deep core sample. At 2.4 meters, Scott decided that this was far enough as they were well below the depth of the heat-flow probes, the main reason for taking the core sample. Not wanting to lose time the next day returning to remove the core, he started to pull it out. He managed to get it up 20 cm but then it refused to move any further. The last task of the day was to set up the flag of the United States. They were outside Falcon for 7 hours and 12 minutes. EVA-3 Overnight, Mission Control decided to cancel the traverse to the North Complex. Time saved not going there would be spent on pulling out the deep core sample. Although annoyed by this, Scott understood that although he was in command of the mission, he was part of a team, and the mission scientists had decided that the core sample was more important than sampling the North Complex. Jim Irwin salutes the US flag Before setting off to the ALSEP site, the crew took some customary publicity shots of them and the flag. Back at the core sample drill, both Scott and Irwin grabbed hold of the drill and tried to pull it out. Slowly but surely, they managed to work it out of the ground by getting up under the drill. A few more tries and it was completely out of the ground. When they came to break the stem apart they found that a vice built into the Rover for the purpose had been installed backwards. Scott by this time was becoming more and more annoyed at the amount of time being spent on this sample and said \\"How many hours do you want to spend on this drill, Joe?\\" Analysis of the core samples found that pebble concentration and density varied dramatically. Along the 7.9 ft (2.4 m) length of the sample, there were more than 50 distinct layers, varying in thickness from 0.2 to 8.2 inches (0.5 to 21 cm). Of particular interest was that the deepest portions of the core samples were too deep for cosmic rays to penetrate, meaning that they had not been affected by recent cosmic ray activity. The Rover TV camera was having problems. Any attempt to pan up or down would cause it to flop down, leaving it pointing uselessly at the ground and requiring an astronaut to repoint it. After making a 16 mm film of the Rover driving for the engineers on Earth, they set off for the main target of their last EVA, Hadley Rille. On the way, they stopped to photograph a rock they suspected had formed a crater nearby. There was no time to stop and sample it. They arrived at a 50 ft (15 m) crater near to their original target crater, Scarp. Scott decided to stop there as it met the original objective of Scarp, which was to collect debris from near the rille. After taking a panorama of the site, Scott took some samples, finding them to be extremely soft. It is thought that the area around them was the youngest ever walked on by an astronaut. Moving on, they traveled to the rille. One of the objectives of Apollo 15 was to sample exposed bedrock at its point of origin. On previous missions, the basalt collected had been thrown there by impacts. As Irwin took the site panorama, Scott used the 500 mm telephoto lens to image the far side of the Rille, which was about 0.6 mi (1 km) across. They were looking for layering in the wall of the Rille, which could help geologists to find if the lava flows that had filled Palus Putredinis came in one go or over time. Irwin started a radial sample. He found a rectangular rock that was too large to return to Earth. Due to the slope of the surrounding area, he was able to see some bedrock below the rim of the Rille that appeared to be above them further along. They walked to a 10 ft (3 m) crater and sampled the meter-sized rocks that it had thrown up. The Lunar Rover at the end of the last EVA of the mission in its final resting place It was meant to be time to move on again, but the geology backroom decided that the loss of another sampling station was offset by the chance of sampling true bedrock, so they were given more time. Moving down to the very edge of the rille, they sampled a 7 ft (2 m) rock. Back at the Rover, they took another rake sample and a core sample. Scott then decided to sample a vuggy, coarsely grained basalt. He decided to take the whole football-shaped rock. Dubbed \\"Great Scott\\", the 21 lb (9.6 kg) sample would be the biggest returned on Apollo 15 (Sample 15555). They moved on to the last station of the mission, Station 10. With little time left, all they could do was photograph the site at a 200 ft (60 m) crater. Scott had one more thing to do once he returned to the lunar module: > Well, in my left hand, I have a feather; in my right hand, a hammer. And I > guess one of the reasons we got here today was because of a gentleman named > Galileo, a long time ago, who made a rather significant discovery about > falling objects in gravity fields. And we thought where would be a better > place to confirm his findings than on the Moon? And so we thought we'd try > it here for you. The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather > for our Falcon. And I'll drop the two of them here and, hopefully, they'll > hit the ground at the same time. And they did. Later investigations found that the feather may have been extracted from the wing of a female gyrfalcon. Scott then drove the Rover for the last time to a point 300 ft (90 m) from the LM so that it could observe the liftoff. He placed a small Bible on the hand controller and then walked about 20 ft (6 m) to a small hollow where he placed a plaque bearing the names of the fourteen known astronauts and cosmonauts to have lost their lives (two cosmonaut deaths had not been made public at the time ‚Äì Valentin Bondarenko and Grigori Nelyubov). Beside it he placed the Fallen Astronaut statuette. They were outside the LM for 4 hours and 50 minutes.

In 2011, Wilkinson received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art & Design. She has also won four Overseas Press Club Awards and two Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards for Cartooning, along with other various awards.  Biography  = Early life and education = Wilkinson was born into a Quaker family in Wichita Falls, Texas on July 25, 1950. She later received a Bachelor of Arts in English at the University of Denver. After earning her degree, she attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; to support herself, she later worked with graphic design at the Academy of Natural Sciences, and various regional newspapers hired her as a stringer. = Career = After Wilkinson received her BA in English, she began to pursue careers in journalism. She worked as a reporter, stringing for the Daily Post, the King of Prussia, and the West Chester Daily Local News. She also worked for the Quakers and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University before working for a housing project in Cyprus. This job shortly ended due to a coup d'√©tat in Cyprus, followed by a military invasion from Turkey. Once Wilkinson returned to reporting, she would draw the people she reported on. Realizing her interest in both art and politics, Wilkinson attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for the duration of a year. During her time at the art school, she stringed for various Philadelphia and New York publications. In 1982, she earned a full-time job at the San Jose Mercury News where she spent three and a half years working as a cartoonist. In the mid 1980s, Wilkinson went on to work for the Philadelphia Daily News as a cartoonist where she still draws five cartoons a week. In 1992, she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. The same year, she released her first collection of cartoons entitled, Abortion Cartoons on Demand. Additionally, Wilkinson has also created cartoons for Working Woman, Ms., Organic Gardening, the Institute for Research on Higher Education and several other publications, such as the Friends Journal and the University Barge Club newspaper. In 1992, she published her first collection of her work, entitled Abortion Cartoons on Demand. In 2005, she released her second collection of cartoons, One Nation, Under Surveillance: Cartoon Rants on Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Privacy. She served as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists from 1994 to 1995. On November 21, 2007, Wilkinson launched a syndicated daily comic strip with United Media entitled Family Tree. This strip focused on environmental issues. 'Family Tree' concluded on August 27, 2011. For Organic Gardening magazine, Wilkinson created a comic strip entitled Shrubbery that centered on botanical and political topics. The Washington Post Writers Group syndicated Wilkinson's cartoons.

Her name combines the Japanese words for \\"chaste\\" (sada) and \\"child\\" (ko). Sadako's fictional history alternates between continuities, but all depict her as the vengeful ghost of a psychic who was murdered and thrown into a well. As a ghost, she uses nensha, her most distinctive power and weapon, to create a cursed video tape that will kill whoever watches it exactly one week later unless the tape is copied and shown to another person, who then must repeat the same process. Sadako Yamamura has been played by a number of actresses in films, including Rie In≈ç in Ring and Ring 2, Hinako Saeki in Rasen, Yukie Nakama in Ring 0: Birthday as the villainous protagonist, Ayane Miura in Ring: Kanzenban, Tae Kimura in Ring: The Final Chapter and Rasen, and Ai Hashimoto in Sadako 3D. Foreign adaptations renamed the character, with Bae Doona portraying Park Eun-suh in the South Korean film The Ring Virus, and Daveigh Chase portraying Samara Morgan in the American films The Ring and The Ring Two; Bonnie Morgan would later take over the role in Rings. Sadako Yamamura appears in K≈çji Shiraishi's 2016 crossover film, Sadako vs. Kayako, with the Ju-on antagonist Kayako Saeki. She is portrayed by Elly Nanami. Origin Sadako's initial origin story differs between the novels and the films. In the novels, Sadako was born in 1947 to Shizuko Yamamura and Dr. Heichachiro Ikuma in Oshima Island. The year before, Shizuko gained psychic powers after retrieving an ancient statuette of En no Ozuno from the ocean. Shizuko also gave birth to a baby boy but he died four months later due to an illness. Planning to move to Tokyo with Ikuma, she entrusted her mother to take care of baby Sadako. At Tokyo, at Ikuma's encouragement, Shizuko displays her psychic powers during a publicized demonstration. However, Shizuko bows out of the demonstration due to migraines brought on by her powers. The press denounces Shizuko as a fraud because of this. Depressed, Shizuko eventually returns to Oshima Island for Sadako. At the age of nineteen, Sadako joins a Tokyo-based acting troupe and falls in love with the sound operator, Hiroshi Toyama. He learns of her powers but accepts them. Unfortunately, an early form of the curse is created in the form of a sound recording which kills four people including the troupe's director, resulting in a heartbroken Sadako leaving Toyama. Sadako visits Ikuma in hospital, only to be raped by a doctor named Nagao Jotaro who cared for her father. However, he discovers that she had Testicular Feminization Syndrome, possessing the genitalia of both sexes. When Sadako attacks him with her powers, Nagao throws her down a nearby well and seals her within. Foreseeing herself being reborn years later, Sadako vows revenge on the world before she dies. As a vengeful ghost, Sadako created a cursed videotape that will kill anyone who watches it 7 days later. Besides wreaking her vengeance upon humanity, Sadako creates the curse to reproduce and ultimately be reborn, something she can not biologically do herself due to being genetically male. The curse is specifically referred to as the \\"Ring Virus\\", embedded within the cursed videotape, since she will \\"live on\\" in it, as long as her DNA merged with that of a strand of the smallpox virus, which she contracted from the rape, still exists. In the novel Spiral, it unfolds that Sadako intended on resurrecting herself through the power of her curse, actually a mutated biological virus that cause heart attacks or pregnancy in women if the right requirements are met. After Mitsuo Ando and Mai Takano have sex, the latter goes through a rapid pregnancy, giving birth to Sadako, who grows into her adult self in a matter of hours. She uses the virus to clone and resurrect Ryuji Takayama as well, and convinces Ando to spread the virus in the form of Kazuyuki Asakawa's journal of the curse in return for resurrecting his own son Takanori. In Loop and its subsequent sequels, the virus was still present in LOOP, a supercomputer project that stimulates the emergence of life and replicates scenes from the previous novels. After LOOP's creator decides to replicate Ryuji's death, by cloning him and inserting him to someone's womb, the virus was unleashed and mutated into Metastatic Human Cancer (MHC), threatening to kill all forms of life. Films Her past alters in the film series. Sadako is not the biological child of Dr. Ikuma and Shizuko but is heavily implied to be the result of sexual intercourse between Shizuko and an enigmatic sea demon after Shizuko spent hours staring at the ocean, which is confirmed by her brother Takashi who spied on her from behind. Takashi later learns of Shizuko's psychic prediction of Mount Mihara's eruption and tells everyone about it, making her an instant celebrity. Dr. Ikuma, eager to prove the existence of ESP, encouraged her to participate in a demonstration at Tokyo. During the demonstration, Shizuko was successfully able to prove her psychic abilities but a spiteful journalist, Miyaji, accused Shizuko of being a fraud, inciting other journalists to join in the slanderous uproar. Sadako, who watched from backstage, snapped and killed Miyaji, to stand up for her mother.Takahashi Hiroshi, \\"Ring\\", translated by J. Lopez, [unpublished, from http://www.curseofthering.com/RingText.txt] Ai Hashimoto played Sadako in Sadako 3D. Sadako eventually split into identical twins, one good and innocent, and the other destructive. After Shizuko committed suicide due to severe depression from the infamous ESP demonstration, Ikuma moved to Izu with the twins. The good Sadako grew into an adult and became an actress, while the evil twin was locked up by Ikuma and drugged to stunt her growth. Sadako's evil self haunted her, leading to her beaten her to death by fellow theatre troupe members, aside from Toyama. Akiko Miyaji, the fianc√© of the journalist whom Sadako killed, leads an angry mob to kill the evil Sadako, only for the twins to merge into one and slaughter her tormentors. Ikuma then wounded and threw Sadako down the well behind his house. Sadako survived within for thirty years and died shortly before the events of Ring, creating the cursed videotape. At the end of the Sadako 3D 2, Sadako's daughter is revealed, which is briefly described by Kashiwada as \\"the seed of despair, growing, and ready to bloom\\", which is also the real cause of the deaths, not Nagi, Akane Ayukawa's daughter. Sadako appears in the crossover film Sadako vs. Kayako, encountering Kayako Saeki, the antagonist of the Ju-On films. Sadako's cursed videotape, in this version, is reduced to a 2-day deadline instead of the traditional 7 day deadline. She is also shown to be much stronger and violent this time, forcing people who try to hinder her curse or escape to kill themselves in brutal ways. The two ghosts battle each other to kill two women who are under both of their respective curses, they are lured to an old well with the help of psychics Keizo Tokiwa and Tamao in an attempt to destroy them both. However, it ends up causing the two ghosts to fuse into Sadakaya. Furthermore, prior to the battle and subsequent fusion, Sadako's curse is inadvertently transferred from the cursed videotape to the Internet, potentially causing her curse to be unleashed by anyone who watches it online. Appearance Sadako's backstory is heavily inspired by the Japanese legend of Okiku. Sadako appears as a young woman whose face is hidden under her long dark hair, and she wears a white dress. This appearance is typical of y≈´rei. Specifically, Sadako is a type of y≈´rei known as an onry≈ç, bound by a desire for vengeance. In Sadako 3D, Sadako appears as her human self while still displaying traits of an onry≈ç, in addition to the standard y≈´rei appearance. Ring: Kanzenban was the only rendition that differs from a traditional y≈´rei appearance. She is shown similarly as a young woman with Testicular Feminization Syndrome, yet her hair rarely covers her face and is frequently portrayed nude as opposed to a white garment. Sadako is also an amalgamation of two famous Japanese ghosts, Oiwa and Okiku. From Oiwa, Sadako takes the single, misshapen eye. From Okiku, the style of murder, of being thrown down a well and then having the ghost rise from the well to seek vengeance. The success of the 1998 film Ring brought the image of the y≈´rei to western popular culture for the first time, although the image has existed in Japan for centuries. This image is often used in J-Horror films, such as Ju-on (and its remake The Grudge), One Missed Call, and Dark Water. Chizuko Mifune, a famous psychic in the early 20th century, is an inspiration for Sadako and her mother Shizuko. Sadako is also based on the life of early-20th century psychic Sadako Takahashi, an apparent practitioner of nensha, the art of projecting images onto film by thought alone. In 1931 Takahashi was studied by psychologist Tomokichi Fukurai for his book, Clairvoyance and Thoughtography. Fukurai also worked with psychic Chizuko Mifune, who inspired the backstory of Sadako and her mother Shizuko. Powers Sadako has a variety of psychic powers throughout all the Ring cycle books and films. The most famous is her ability to create the \\"cursed\\" video tape. =Videotape= In the films her method of killing with the video curse is not explained, but when someone is killed by it she is seen climbing out of a nearby surface, often a television screen, and approaching them. The corpses are discovered with looks of unearthly anguish on their faces. In Spiral, the curse is explained in detail, and is discovered to be a virus. When someone watches the cursed tape (or something else carrying the curse) some of their DNA is changed to become that of the Ring Virus (a hybrid of Sadako's DNA and that of the smallpox virus). This travels throughout their body and in most cases causes a sarcoma to form on one of the arteries of their heart. If the curse has not been appeased within seven days, the sarcoma detaches from the artery and clogs it, causing heart failure. Eventually, however, the virus is able to infect people through means other than videotapes, such as a report detailing the events of Ring written by Kazuyuki Asakawa in which the virus had entered from Asakawa's body, a novel version of the report published by Asakawa's brother, a movie based on the novel (which Sadako was cast as herself in), and finally the Metastatic Human Cancer virus that appears in the third novel, Loop. Each version of the video tape contains disturbing imagery. The novel version features messages at the start and end of the tape, though the method to removing the curse was recorded over. Most of the footage is from Sadako's perspective, including being sexually assaulted by Nagao Jotaro. The films' incarnation has more abstract imagery, and features an enigmatic figure whose face is obscured by a towel, pointing out to something off-screen. He is collectively referred to as the \\"Towel Man\\", and is speculated to symbolise Sadako's unknown, possibly otherworldly biological father. He appears in Ring, directing Reiko to Yoichi watching the tape, and later points out the copy she made of the tape, implying he may actually be Ryuji Takayama following his death. The final shot of the tape is of the well, which extends with each viewing, until the deadline of the curse where Sadako emerges from the well and then crawls out of the nearest reflective surface to kill her victim. An alternate version of the tape was featured in Ring: The Final Chapter, portrayed as being recorded during pop singer Nao Matsuzaki's music video, and the deadline for the curse was extended to thirteen days. The American film incarnation is probably the longest, and mostly consists of abstract imagery or exaggerated visions that Samara Morgan has seen, but still adapts a lot from the Japanese version including the infamous final sequence where Samara emerges from a television to kill her victims. Other versions =Park Eun- Suh= Sadako was the source for the character Park Eun-Suh from the 1999 Korean remake, The Ring Virus. She is portrayed by Korean actress Bae Doona. Park Eun-Suh more closely resembles the Sadako from the novels. She appears to be about the same age as Sadako, though her age is never confirmed; she is only said to have disappeared after high school. She and her mother both had supernatural powers (similar to Sadako and Shizuko) and were rumored to be witches. After Eun-Suh's mother throws herself off a cliff into the sea, Eun- Suh's powers mysteriously disappear. As she grows older, she works at a nightclub under the name \\"Sunny Park\\". Her powers return. She is able to turn on an unplugged TV, and murders a man with her abilities after she catches him peeping on her showering. Eun-Suh is raped by her half brother shortly before her death, during which he discovers that she is a hermaphrodite. She is ashamed, and telepathically threatens him. Horrified, he chokes her unconscious and drops her in a nearby well at the Sanitarium he was staying at for smallpox. =Samara Morgan= Daveigh Chase played Samara Morgan in The Ring. Sadako was the main influence on Samara Morgan from the 2002 American remake, The Ring and its sequels, The Ring Two and Rings. She was played by Daveigh Chase, Kelly Stables and Bonnie Morgan, respectively. Samara Morgan is depicted as an otherworldly little girl, responsible for the creation of the cursed videotape from the American version of the Ring story. Her usual appearance is of a girl with long, dark hair covering her face and wearing a white dress. Samara possesses the power of nensha like Sadako, capable of burning images onto surfaces and into the minds of others. Unlike Sadako, Samara psychically disfigures her victims' faces before they finally die of a heart attack. Samara's history is covered through the American films. The Ring explains that Samara is adopted by Anna and Richard Morgan (Shannon Cochran and Brian Cox), who own a horse ranch on Moesko Island, Washington. As Samara grows older, her powers burn horrible images into her adoptive mother's mind, nearly driving her insane. Richard banishes Samara to live in the ranch's barn, but she uses her powers to drive Anna's beloved horses to suicide. At some point, Samara is taken to a psychiatric hospital but the doctors are unable to explain how she created the images. During a family vacation on Shelter Mountain, Anna attacks Samara as she stands before an old well, suffocating her with a garbage bag and then dropping her down the well. Anna then commits suicide by jumping off a cliff. However, Samara clings to life for seven days alone in the well before dying from a combination of starvation and hypothermia. Eventually, a set of rental cabins are built near the well, one on top of it. This allows Samara to project her visions into a VCR tape, creating the seven-day curse. Samara's curse kills Katie (Amber Tamblyn), the niece of journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), who investigates the tape's origins. Rachel, her ex-boyfriend Noah Clay (Martin Henderson) and their son Aidan (David Dorfman) all watch the video. Rachel meets Richard, who warns her to stay away and then kills himself via electrocution. Rachel and Noah eventually find Samara's corpse in the well and bury it. Unfortunately, this releases a corporeal, grotesque form of Samara's spirit and she kills Noah as per the rules of the curse. Rachel destroys the original video cassette in a fit of rage, but uses a copied version of the video to continue the curse in order to save Aidan. The Ring Two expands upon Samara's backstory: her mother, a woman named Evelyn (Sissy Spacek and Mary Elizabeth Winstead), believed that her daughter had a demon inside her and tried to drown the girl, but she was prevented by nuns. Evelyn is sent to an insane asylum, while Samara was put up for adoption. In the film's present timeline, Samara deliberately manipulates the tape to get back to Rachel, having decided to make Rachel her new mother. After Rachel burns the tape, Samara possesses Aidan. Rachel drugs Samara and then nearly drowns Aidan to exorcise her. Samara retreats to a television set, Rachel being willingly pulled into Samara's visionary world and down the well. Rachel climbs out of the well with Samara pursuing her, but Rachel covers the seal on the well just in time. In Rings, expands further back on Evelyn's backstory, Evelyn, (Kayli Carter), was kidnapped by a local priest, Galen Burke (Vincent D'Onofrio), who raped and impregnated her which led to Samara's conception during Evelyn's captivity. Years after his daughter's death, Burke sealed Samara's remains in a wall of his house at some point after the events of the first film, knowing her spirit still plagues those who have encountered her. He also blinded himself so Samara couldn't kill him. Samara has been looking for a compassionate host in order to be reborn, which she finds in the high school graduate, Julia (Matilda Lutz). Burke tries to kill Julia, but Samara rises out of Julia's iPhone, restores Burke's sight, and kills him. After the cremation of her remains, Samara's spirit now resides in Julia. In the film's closing scenes, Samara's video begins spreading online and goes viral. Portrayals A number of actresses have portrayed Sadako in the numerous films and television adaptations of the novels, as well as in foreign adaptations. =Sadako Yamamura= *Rie In≈ç ‚Äì Ring, Ring 2 *Hinako Saeki ‚Äì Rasen *Ayane Miura ‚Äì Ring: Kanzenban *Tae Kimura ‚Äì Ring: The Final Chapter, Rasen *Yukie Nakama ‚Äì Ring 0: Birthday *Ai Hashimoto ‚Äì Sadako 3D *Elly Nanami ‚Äì Sadako vs. Kayako *Ayaka Minami - Sadako =Park Eun-Suh= *Bae Doona ‚Äì The Ring Virus =Samara Morgan= *Daveigh Chase ‚Äì The Ring (The Ring Two & Rings (2017) (archival footage)) *Kelly Stables ‚Äì The Ring (stunts), The Ring Two and Rings (2005) *Bonnie Morgan ‚Äì The Ring Two (stunts) and Rings (2017) Reception The character of Sadako and Samara Morgan have been well received by audiences and film critics alike. The Movie Book describes Sadako as influencing the whole Japanese horror genre, making the mythological image of the yurei popular in film. British film critic Mark Kermode lists Sadako's iconic crawl out of a television set as his seventh scariest moment from the horror film genre. The scene also came sixth in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Scary Moments. On August 10, 2002, Sadako was given a public funeral at the Laforet Museum in Harajuku, Tokyo, to tie-in with the opening of a Ring exhibit at the museum and the release of The Ring, with Koji Suzuki attending the funeral. Empire's Mark Dinning described Samara as one of the film industry's most \\"unrelenting, unreasonable, plain uncontrollable baddies ever.\\" Daveigh Chase has been praised for her performance as Samara Morgan, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain at the 2003 ceremony.

Apollo 15 was the first mission to carry the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay, which contained a panoramic camera, gamma ray spectrometer, mapping camera, laser altimeter and mass spectrometer. Worden had to operate the shutter and lenses on the cameras and turn on and off the various instruments. During the coast back to Earth, he would perform an EVA to retrieve film cassettes from the cameras. Day 1 A section of a panoromic camera photograph showing a high resolution view of the landing site. Boulders are easily seen in the rille and the ground disturbed by the lunar module engine shows as a white patch at lower left. South is up. Many of his observations were of far side features that had not been seen in great detail. The panoramic camera was a modified version of the U.S. Air Force's KA-80A camera for its spy satellites, using a 610 mm f/3.5 lens. This particular camera was similar to those used by the Lockheed U-2, A-12 Oxcart and SR-71 Blackbird. It could see features as small as 3 ft (1 m) across on the lunar surface. It would take long strips, 205 by 13 mi (330 by 21 km) of the surface, on 3.8 foot by 4.5 inch (114.8 by 11.4 cm) strips of film. Over the course of the mission it would take 1,529 usable images, exposing 2 km of film. The film cassette weighed 55 lb (25 kg). The other camera in the SIM bay was the Mapping Camera. This consisted of two cameras, the Metric Camera and the Stellar Camera. The Metric Camera took square frames of film, covering about 27,000 km¬≤ of the lunar surface, with a resolution of about 20 m. Using the stellar camera, R√©seau plates (which added the familiar crosses to Apollo photographs), and other data provided by the laser altimeter, it was possible to identify the exact position on the lunar surface of the photograph taken. A total of 2,240 usable photographs were produced. The Laser Altimeter could measure the height of the CSM above the lunar surface to within one meter. It used a pulsed ruby laser operating at 694.3 nanometers and 200 millijoule pulses of 10 nanoseconds duration. The Stellar Camera was used during the runs of the Laser Altimeter on the night side of the Moon. It would show the exact position of the laser beam, for calibration of the altimeter's results. During his first pass over the landing site, after landing, Worden attempted to see Falcon using the 28 times magnification sextant. He was successful, refining the position of the site. This was of great help to mission planners as it would help them further refine the planning of the traverses by Scott and Irwin, and also help with photographic interpretation from the surface. Another experiment performed on Apollo 15 involved using the radio signal of Endeavour and was termed the Downlink bistatic radar Experiment to find the dielectric constant of the surface material. During the 17th near side pass, while Worden was eating his dinner, the spacecraft was oriented so that its radio signal would reflect off the Moon and be received by the Earth. The strength of this signal varies with the angle of incidence. The Brewster's angle is when the signal is the weakest and is a function of the dielectric constant. Before going to sleep, Worden orientated the spacecraft best for the various experiments of the SIM bay, specifically the spectrometers. The Gamma-ray Spectrometer detected radiation with energies of 1 MeV to 10 MeV. As the gamma ray passed through a cylinder of doped sodium iodide, it would emit light that would be detected by a photomultiplier tube. Another photomultiplier tube detected charged particles that passed through a plastic shield around the cylinder. All of this was on the end of a 25 ft (7.6 m) boom that would be deployed and retracted periodically during the mission. It sat at the end of the boom so that it would not be contaminated by the spacecraft. The Alpha Particle Spectrometer measured the alpha particles emitted by the surface, specifically by the gaseous radon-222 and radon-220. It was optimized to detect particles of energies of 4.7 to 9.1 MeV. It was built into the same casing as the X-ray Spectrometer. The X-ray Spectrometer was used to investigate the properties of the upper layers of the lunar surface. As solar X-rays strike the surface, they cause the elements to fluoresce X-rays with well defined energies. The spectrometer could measure these and determine the composition of the lunar surface. Day 2 Worden's first full day of solo operations was much the same as the previous day. He spent much of his time switching various experiments on and off and acquiring photographs of targets of interest on the lunar surface. Even after one day in orbit, mission scientists were extremely pleased with the data returned by the spectrometers. However, due to orbital mechanics, they would only get data from the part of the Moon along their orbital track. During the six days in lunar orbit, the Moon only rotated about 20% and the spacecraft's orbit was only inclined by 26¬∞. So only a small amount of the lunar surface was actually covered. Ideally for scientists, a mission would be placed in a polar orbit for a month, from where it could observe the entire lunar surface. Lunar scientists were particularly interested in rocks that had higher concentrations of samarium, uranium, thorium, potassium and phosphorus. They gave these rocks the acronym KREEP (potassium (atomic symbol K), rare earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P)). The gamma-ray spectrometer was designed to detect these types of rocks. They had been found at the Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 landing sites but not at the Apollo 11 site, which was about 1,000 km to the east of the Apollo 14 site. At the time of Apollo 15, scientists were interested in whether KREEP rocks were found all over the Moon or just in the region around 12 and 14. It is believed that KREEPs represent the last chemical remnants of the \\"magma ocean\\" after the lunar crust formed. KREEPs floated to the surface because their component elements are \\"incompatible\\", that is, they did not incorporate into compact crystal structures. In the late 1990s, results from Lunar Prospector's gamma ray spectrometer shows that KREEP-containing rocks are concentrated in the Mare Imbrium rim, the near side maria and highlands near Imbrium and the Mare Ingenii South Pole-Aitken basin and are distributed at a lower level in the highlands. The distribution seen by Lunar Prospector supports the idea that the impact which formed Mare Imbrium excavated KREEP-rich rocks and ejected them over the Moon, and the South Pole-Aitken basin impact also exposed KREEP- rich material. One of the more personal things that Worden did during the mission was how he greeted Mission Control after reappearing from behind the Moon on each orbit. He and Farouk El-Baz had decided to use the phrase \\"Hello Earth; Greetings from Endeavour\\" but in different languages, ranging from Arabic to Spanish. Problems developed with the Panoramic Camera. It used what was called a \\"V-over-H\\" sensor to measure the motion of the surface beneath it, from which is worked out how to move the camera to compensate for this motion. From the beginning this sensor had begun to play up, with only about 80% of images being without some blurring. It would not affect the camera greatly but was an annoyance. Aristarchus and to its right is Herodotus. This photograph was taken on the second to last day, after the LM had redocked. One of the targets of particular interest was the crater Aristarchus. In 1963, Jim Greenacre saw a reddish glow in the region. This was confirmed by four other observers including the then-director of the Lowell Observatory. Apollo 15 was the first manned spacecraft to pass over the site. At the time it was not in direct sunlight but was illuminated by light reflected off the Earth -- Earthshine. Worden did not see any glows, even though he described it as being \\"so bright in Earthshine, it's almost as bright, it seems like, as it is in sunshine. Very, very bright crater.\\" A regular task for the crew was exercise. It had been found on even the short duration flights, the crews became weakened due to the lack of gravity. The Exergym was a bungee cord that the crew would pull on to keep their shoulders and arms strong. Worden would also fold away the center couch and jog on the stop. Other exercises the crew found that they could do were to position themselves between the bulkhead and the couches and to do kneebends against their arms. During the Technical Debrief at the end of the mission, the crew said that although it was planned for all of them to do equal amounts of exercise, Worden did twice as much, as he was in weightlessness for the entire mission, while the other two would spend three days in the one-sixth gravity of the Moon. During a pass over the Littrow region, Worden reported seeing \\"small, almost irregular shaped cones\\", which he said looked like cinder cones. This observation would become one of the main reasons for going there on Apollo 17. It would turn out that one of these 'cinder cones' was just an impact crater, when visited by Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17 and that what in fact he was seeing were young craters with dark ejecta blankets. Evidence did emerge for volcanic activity at Shorty when orange soil was found there. This was composed of orange glass beads which were sprayed while molten from a fumarole or \\"fire fountain\\" 3.64 billion years ago. Day 3 Hadley-Apennine area as seen from the Mapping Camera. The mountain in the center is Mons Hadley Delta. During the third day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some problems with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located on the end of a boom that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that guide pins were barely coming through the guide slot. Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the motor stalling out, implying that the parts of the boom were being deformed by thermal expansion. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on Apollo 16 and Apollo 17. 146 hours after launch, Worden position the spacecraft so that he could take photographs of the region of the 'sky' opposite the Sun, in hopes of seeing the gegenschein. This faint glow is thought to be caused by tiny particles in the interplanetary medium reflecting light back at the observer. Due to aiming errors, no useful data was returned. Other non-lunar targets were the zodiacal light and the corona of the Sun. Day 4 The fourth solo day was an extremely busy one, for both crews. Scott and Irwin had a five-hour LEVA and for liftoff from the Moon. Worden would then have to perform a rendezvous and docking with the LM. Before all of this, Worden had to perform a plane change burn. During the three days, the orbital path of Endeavour had drifted so that it no longer passed over the landing site. As such, without this burn, rendezvous would have been complicated. This was an 18-second burn of the SPS, coming just after Endeavour reappeared from behind the Moon on its 45th orbit. Worden then attempted to make a sighting of Falcon on the surface. This was done to provide accurate information of the new orbit of the CSM, to help with the upcoming rendezvous. However he had difficulty due to the Sun having risen higher, making the relief much less and the surface much brighter.  References  *Chaikin, Andrew (1994).

It is an account of Garner's presence at the separate trials of Anu Singh and her friend Madhavi Rao, who were accused of murdering Singh's boyfriend Joe Cinque and Garner's attempts to understand the events that led to his death, as well as the legal and personal responses to the crime. The book was adapted into a 2016 film of the same name. Joe Cinque's Consolation explores themes of grief and loss, culpability and criminal responsibility, duty of care, punishment and retribution, personality psychology (particularly narcissistic personality disorder and dependent personality disorder), social class in Australia, drug use, and other social problems. A national bestseller, the book has sold 100,000 copies.  Joe Cinque's death  Anu Singh, a law student at Canberra's Australian National University, killed her boyfriend Joe Cinque on 26 October 1997 with a lethal dose of heroin, after she had laced his coffee with Rohypnol. A number of her friends and acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him and some were present at parties she held in which he was drugged; none of these friends alerted authorities or police. She was subsequently found guilty of his manslaughter. The most involved of the friends, Madhavi Rao, was acquitted of all charges. Rao moved abroad and adopted a new identity after the conclusion of the trials, while Singh was released from prison in 2001.  Summary  Joe Cinque's Consolation begins with Garner being informed of Singh's second 1999 trial and its circumstances, when it was already in progress. She becomes interested and travels from her Sydney residence to attend the hearings in Canberra. She relates her impressions of the trial, including her negative reactions to Singh and her mystification at Rao's and others' lack of shock at and complicity in Singh's plans, which she determines to be a state of apathy and abandonment of compassion. As the trial progresses she becomes acquainted with Cinque's mother Maria and feels that the court system is not distributing sufficient justice to the victim or his family. After the trial Garner interviews Singh's family and attempts to interview Singh and Rao, but both refuse or are uncontactable. Because of Singh's refusal to be interviewed or contacted, Garner bases most of her information about the woman from erstwhile friends, anecdotal evidence and court transcripts. Singh is portrayed as socially gifted and ambitious, but highly narcissistic, with significant self-esteem issues. Additionally, Garner notes the accused kept diaries about her interactions with men as a teen in which she treated them as disposable commodities, wore high heels to high school, and according to anecdotal evidence from her former best friend, treated Cinque with an element of derision-sometimes mocking him and making jibes about what she thought was a lack of intellect and sophistication to her friends. Some of Singh's former friends thought her to be shallow, self-obsessed and desperate for male approval. As the book progresses, Garner becomes interested in victim's rights, interviews the presiding judge and repeatedly visits and becomes a friend of Cinque's family, and eventually concludes that the purpose of the book is to be consolation for Joe Cinque, as the trial proceedings could not be. =Themes= Garner uses the case to explore far-reaching themes of human behaviour, culpability and responsibility, duty of care, victims' rights and crime/punishment. She also touches on issues that range from the nature of human memory, including how it is not explicitly clear or cohesive, nor is it linear, and thus under cross-examination in a courtroom, any kind of lapse in memory, or contradiction of a preceding statement, may portray a person as a liar or an unworthy witness. Class and cultural clashes are drawn between the working class Italian-Australian family of the Cinques, compared to the \\"professional class\\" Indian-Australian family of the Singhs. This comparison starkly juxtaposes the blue-collar or working class Cinques (although Joe Cinque had a degree in engineering), from a working-class Newcastle suburb with the middle class status of the Singhs, who lived in comfortable inner- west Sydney. Furthermore, the use of psychiatry in law, is alluded to various times. Garner questions whether a \\"psychological sophistication\\" that has developed in light of modern behavioural science overrides the fact that some actions are plainly wrong and should be punishable, regardless of the pathology of the person who commits them. She poses this question in reference to Anu Singh. Singh's defence team used her \\"abnormality of mind\\" (a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and psychotic depression was referenced in the court proceedings) as an explanation for her killing Cinque, akin to the insanity defense. Finally, Garner laments on the perfunctory decision that the Crown psychiatrist would not be given direct access to Singh, and her diagnosis would be made instead on the basis of transcripts and interviews with mental health professionals in the past ‚Äì Garner admits this \\"floored\\" her. Additionally, one reviewer writing for the Australian Book Review opined that it was Maria Cinque who called out the \\"flaky moral relativism\\" of the ANU students who were indifferent to Singh's plans, as well as the Canberra courts, the defence lawyers and the judge who handled the case. The complicity of the students, and whether or not they played a role in Cinque's death by not alerting authorities, was also a topic debated extensively throughout the text.  Critical response  Joe Cinque's Consolation was reviewed in a number of major newspapers and magazines. It was praised for Garner's writing and its positioning as Joe Cinque's story. Criticisms of the book centered on it failing to tell the story it set out to tell, particularly its inability to explain Singh or her actions and her failure to engage with the purpose of the adversarial justice system. Some saw this as a deliberate attempt by Garner - to honour Cinque, whose family had been not been given a voice or adequate justice by the court. In his review for the Australian Book Review, Peter Rose remarked that \\"books such as Joe Cinque‚Äôs Consolation often dignify the parents' agony and indignation. In Maria Cinque we have one of the great stalwarts in this literature of loss. She is always there in court ‚Äì listening, occasionally hissing and weeping, raging when she must. 'They were keeping vigil,‚Äô Garner says, marvelling at the Cinques' stamina. Which is what Garner becomes conscious of doing.\\" He further commented on the book being Garner's conscious testament to the injustice dealt to Joe Cinque and his family: \\"For what are these books but tributes to the dead, swipes at our forgetfulness, minor consolations for the living: the parents and siblings and friends who feel devastated and betrayed? One thinks of all the unattested lives, the little murders\\". Elisabeth Hanscombe, writing for Academia, wrote that Garner's writing, and her depiction of Anu Singh, addressed the notion that for a layperson it \\"may perhaps be difficult to understand that someone can be extremely intelligent, can function well academically, be beautiful and at the same time be seriously disturbed\\". One reviewer compared it with The First Stone (1995), noting that it was less about the underlying debates and more about the story. Another, Maryanne Dever (writing for the Australian Women's Book Review) criticised similarities in the themes of both books, particularly Garner's perceived hostility to the women subjects and their physical appearance. The cover of the re-printed edition from 2006 contains a blurb extracted from a review in The Bulletin, which reads: \\"A book which functions at one level as a psychological mystery, but at deeper levels is an exploration of the adequacy of the law to dispense justice, and the responsibility that human beings have to each other...It is told with compassion, a singular kind of honesty, and unadorned intelligence\\".  Media response  Both Singh herself and Cinque's parents gave interviews shortly after the book's release. Singh recounted her own memories of the killing and her feelings about it after her release and expressed regret at not agreeing to an interview by Garner. She told interviewers that she wished to redress some of the book's imbalance towards her. Maria Cinque said that she would never forgive Singh for killing her son and did not believe her defence against the murder charge. Garner also stated that she still did not understand or empathise with Singh, although some aspects of her behaviour resonated.

Marcelin Berthelot, Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs (3 vol., Paris, 1887‚Äì1888, p.161); F. Sherwood Taylor, \\"The Origins of Greek Alchemy,\\" Ambix 1 (1937), 40. Zosimos of Panopolis () was an Egyptian-born Greek alchemist and Gnostic mystic who lived at the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th century AD. He was born in Panopolis (present day Akhmim, in the south of Roman Egypt), and flourished ca. 300. He wrote the oldest known books on alchemy, which he called \\"Cheirokmeta,\\" using the Greek word for \\"things made by hand.\\" Pieces of this work survive in the original Greek language and in translations into Syriac or Arabic. He is one of about 40 authors represented in a compendium of alchemical writings that was probably put together in Constantinople in the 7th or 8th century AD, copies of which exist in manuscripts in Venice and Paris. Stephen of Alexandria is another. Arabic translations of texts by Zosimos were discovered in 1995 in a copy of the book Keys of Mercy and Secrets of Wisdom by Ibn Al-Hassan Ibn Ali Al-Tughra'i', a Persian alchemist. Unfortunately, the translations were incomplete and seemingly non-verbatim.Note: A selected list of articles from this journal which were previously posted online have been removed.

If you wish to re-attempt this, the original link was: http://washacadsci.org/Journal/Journalarticles/ZosimosText.H.S.ElKhadem.pdf, and the following is a link to the page on the Wayback Machine. The famous index of Arabic books, Kitab al-Fihrist by Ibn Al-Nadim, mentions earlier translations of four books by Zosimos, however due to inconsistency in transliteration, these texts were attributed to names \\"Thosimos\\", \\"Dosimos\\" and \\"Rimos\\"; also it is possible that two of them are translations of the same book. Fuat Sezgin, a historian of Islamic science, found 15 manuscripts of Zozimos in six libraries, at Tehran, Cairo, Istanbul, Gotha, Dublin and Rampur. Mich√®le Mertens analyzed what is known about those manuscripts in her translation of Zozimos, concluding that the Arabic tradition seems extremely rich and promising, and regretting the difficulty of access to these materials until translated editions are available. Alchemy Zosimos provided one of the first definitions of alchemy as the study of \\"the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying and disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies.\\" In general, Zosimos' understanding of alchemy reflects the influence of Hermetic and Gnostic spiritualities. He asserted that the fallen angels taught the arts of metallurgy to the women they married, an idea also recorded in the Book of Enoch and later repeated in the Gnostic Apocryphon of John. In a fragment preserved by Syncellus, Zosimos wrote: The external processes of metallic transmutation‚Äîthe transformations of lead and copper into silver and gold were said to always to mirror an inner process of purification and redemption. In his work Concerning the true Book of Sophe, the Egyptian, and of the Divine Master of the Hebrews and the Sabaoth Powers, Zosimos wrote: Greek alchemists used what they called ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ Œ∏Œµ·øñŒøŒΩ, meaning both divine water, and sulphurous water. For Zosimos, the alchemical vessel was imagined as a baptismal font, and the tincturing vapours of mercury and sulphur were likened to the purifying waters of baptism, which perfected and redeemed the Gnostic initiate. Zosimos drew upon the Hermetic image of the krater or mixing bowl, a symbol of the divine mind in which the Hermetic initiate was \\"baptized\\" and purified in the course of a visionary ascent through the heavens and into the transcendent realms. Similar ideas of a spiritual baptism in the \\"waters\\" of the transcendent pleroma are characteristic of the Sethian Gnostic texts unearthed at Nag Hammadi. This image of the alchemical vessel as baptismal font is central to his Visions, discussed below. Carl Jung and the Visions of Zosimos One of Zosimos' texts is about a sequence of dreams related to Alchemy, and presents the proto-science as a much more religious experience. In his dream he first comes to an altar and meets Ion, who calls himself \\"the priest of inner sanctuaries, and I submit myself to an unendurable torment.\\" Ion then fights and impales Zosimos with a sword, dismembering him \\"in accordance with the rule of harmony\\" (referring to the division into four bodies, natures, or elements). He takes the pieces of Zosimos to the altar, and \\"burned (them) upon the fire of the art, till I perceived by the transformation of the body that I had become spirit.\\" From there, Ion cries blood, and horribly melts into \\"the opposite of himself, into a mutilated anthroparion\\"‚Äîwhich Carl Jung perceived as the first concept of the homunculus in alchemical literature. Zosimos wakes up, asks himself, \\"Is not this the composition of the waters?\\" and returns to sleep, beginning the visions again‚Äîhe constantly wakes up, ponders to himself and returns to sleep during these visions. Returning to the same altar, Zosimos finds a man being boiled alive, yet still alive, who says to him, \\"The sight that you see is the entrance, and the exit, and the transformation ... Those who seek to obtain the art (or moral perfection) enter here, and become spirits by escaping from the body\\"‚Äîwhich can be regarded as human distillation; just as how distilled water purifies it, distilling the body purifies it as well. He then sees a Brazen Man (another homunculus, as Jung believed any man described as being metal is perceived as being a homunculus), a Leaden Man (an \\"agathodaemon\\" and also a homunculus, but see also Agathodaemon the alchemist). Zosimos also dreams of a \\"place of punishments\\" where all who enter immediately burst into flames and submit themselves to an \\"unendurable torment.\\" Jung believed these visions to be a sort of Alchemical allegory, with the tormented homunculi personifying transmutations‚Äîburning or boiling themselves to become something else. The central image of the visions are the Sacrificial Act, which each Homunculus endures. In alchemy the dyophysite nature is constantly emphasized, two principles balancing one another, active and passive, masculine and feminine, which constitute the eternal cycle of birth and death. This is also illustrated in the figure of the uroboros, the dragon that bites its own tail (and which appears earliest in the Chrysopoeia). Self-devouring is the same as self-destruction, but the unison of the dragon's tail and mouth was also thought of as self- fertilization. Hence the text of \\"Tractatus Avicennae\\" mentions \\"the dragon slays itself, weds itself, impregnates itself.\\" In the visions, circular thinking appears in the sacrificial priest's identity with his victim and in the idea that the homunculus into whom Ion is changed devours himself‚Äîhe spews fourth his own flesh and rends himself with his own teeth. The homunculus therefore stands for the uroboros, which devours itself and gives birth to self. Since the homonculus represents the transformation of Ion, it follows that Ion, the uroboros, and the sacrificer are essentially the same. The Book of Pictures This book is divided into 13 chapters, each of them being introduced by a separate image. Two chapters contain a whole series of images, which - according to Zosimos‚Äô statements - are meant to be pondered upon in order to better understand his teaching. The whole text gives a lively dialogue between an alchemical couple: i.e. Zosimos and his female student Theosebeia, revolving about Zosimos' teaching. It reports Theosebeia's complaining about unclear statements of Zosimos as well as Zosimos' anger about her inability to understand his statements. At first sight, the dialogue deals with question upon how to understand statements of alchemical philosophers like Agathodaimon, Democritos, Isis, Moses, Maria, Ostanes, as well as with questions about technical aspects of the alchemical work. But again and again, Zosimos emphasises that he does not talk about the substances and processes as such, as matter, but that they have to be understood symbolically. Zosimos describes the alchemical work by means of a series of images and says to Theosebeia: \\"What I wrote and told you, and with the picture I made for you with me in it, I gave you what you need to know, and this should be enough for you.\\". He also states, that these images depict his own innerpsychic process of transformation. Zosimos' teaching is based on the one hand on his own dream visions, reported in the text. Another source for his teaching was his suffering of a passionate love relationship to Theosebeia, being not allowed to be simply lived out physically. This led him to understand the alchemical work as psychic transformation, enabling the adept to hold and contain the fire of attraction. Correspondingly, Zosimos drew symbolic images of his own death and resurrection as explanation for Theosebeia. Following Abt, the book can be regarded as the earliest historical description of an alchemical work based on a psychic transformation.‚Äú And it ‚Äúis a testimony of the painstaking quest to understand not only the problem but also the meaning of attraction, repulsion and ultimate reconciliation between the outer male and female as well as the inner fire and water‚Äù a process that ‚Äúis described [‚Ä¶] with basic substances, mirroring the very elemental, collective character of this process.‚Äù In this book, we find fragments of writings from ‚ÄûThe Sulfurs‚Äú, which are ascribed to Zosimos and from his ‚ÄúLetters to Theosebeia‚Äù. In the course of the dialogue, those fragments seem to be interrupted by Theosebeia's questions and by further explanations. By this, Zosimos‚Äô teaching is presented in an easier and more understandable way, as Abt holds. With regard to content and style, there are similarities between both books, \\"the Book of Pictures\\" and the \\"Book of Keys\\" (see there). Up to now, only one single Arabic manuscript of the \\"Book of Pictures\\" is extant. In the fourth part of the \\"Book of the Rank of the Sage (Rutbat al-·∏§akƒ´m) its author Maslama al-Qur»õubƒ´ (formerly wrongly assigned to Maslama al-Magriti)For the discussion on the authorship, see W. Madelungs English \\"Introduction\\" to the Arabic edition: The Book of the Rank of the Sage. Rutbat al-·∏§akƒ´m by Maslama al-Qur·π≠ubƒ´. p. 9-24. quotes extensively from the ‚ÄúBook of Pictures‚Äù. He is the first author quoting it, but using another Greek original than the one published in 2015 The Greek authorship has been debated, see the introduction of the English translation of 'The Book of Pictures' by Th. Apt. P. Lory states that Th. Abt has convincing arguments on the Greek authorship of the Book of Pictures. See his review on Th. Abt's Zosimos of Panapolis. The Book of Pictures. Mushaf as-suwar. In: Bulletin critique des Annales Islamologiques, BCAI 28 (2012), Institut fran√ßais d‚Äôarch√©ologie orientale (IFAO), Le Caire, p. 133. than the version published 2015 (CALA III, by Th. Abt) For a list of such fragments see Manfred Ullmann: Die Natur- und Geheimwissenschaften im Islam. Handbuch der Orientalistik I. Abteilung, Erg√§nzungsband VI, zweiter Abschnitt. p. 161f. On the Risalat as- Sirr, see p.162f. On the Kitab al-Habib, see p.179. and has influenced several alchemists like the early Arabic alchemist Ibn Umail, the \\"Kitab al-Habib\\" (Book of the Friend/Lover; including a dialogue between a so-called Rusam and Theosebeia) and the alchemist \\"Hermes of Dendera\\", author of \\"Risalat as-Sirr\\" (Epistle of the Secret; including a similar dialogue between Hermes Budasir und Amnutasiya). Other traits of Latin symbolic alchemy, like the traditional division of the work in 12 parts or the representation of inner and outer relationship between adept and soror mystica (e.g. in \\"Rosarium Philosophorum\\" and in \\"Mutus Liber\\") can be traced back to this book and seem to be influcend by it. Fragments of the text of the \\"Book of Pictures\\" can be found in \\"Rosarium Philosophorum\\" and \\"Artis Auriferae\\". (e.g. titled \\"Tractatus Rosini ad Euticiam\\" (=\\"Treatise of Rosinus to Euticia\\"). The Book of Pictures itself is influenced by Ancient Egyptian thinking, its iconography showing relations to pharaonic iconography and having motifs paralleling Egyptian books of the underworld like Amduat, which was known until Greek-Roman times. Regarding the inner and outer relationship between man and woman or between psychic male and female aspects, the \\"Book of Pictures\\" forms a cultural bridge between pharaonic thoughts and European medieval alchemy.  The Book of the Keys of the Work  This book is written as commentary in 10 chapters on \\"the Book of the 10 Keys\\", a work ascribed to Democritus (Democritus of Abdera or Pseudo- Democritus). As at the beginning of the book (fol. 41a.3-4) is written, this commentary was Zosimos‚Äô last text written for Theosebeia. According to Abt, the book gives an essence of Zosimos‚Äô teachings, as the preamble says, that the book is so clear and understandable, that after its reading, Theosebeia \\"understood the [alchemical] work\\". There are many parallels between the \\"Book of the Keys of the Work\\" and \\"The Book of Pictures‚Äú in terms of subject and style: Both books are written \\"to my lady\\" and mainly \\"in dialogue form, [... have] the same emphasis on the fact that there is just one alchemical operation [...], the alchemical work is one and emphasises the same central role for Democritus, 'the head of the sages of his time' [...]. The operation in both books centres on a composition of vapours [...]. It has the same essential feature of extracting the subtle with 'gentleness' [...] from all four natures, the mixture of like with like, and the need to bind the fugitive spirit. They have analogies in common, for example that of copper with the human being. As in the \\"Book of Pictures\\", one can trace motives and symbols of Zosimos' teachings that go back to the worldview of pharaonic Egypt. Integrating these motives allows a better understanding of the text.

O'Carroll is a former chairman of the now disbanded Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) and was at one time a prominent member of the International Paedophile and Child Emancipation (now known as Ipce). Earlier life O'Carroll grew up in Coventry, attending Whitmore Park Primary School and Woodlands school. in 1967 he graduated from Lancaster University with a degree in history. He worked as a teacher at Henry Parkes Primary School and Caludon Castle School in the 1970s. As a postgraduate, O'Carroll studied education at Downing College, Cambridge.http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tom_O%27Carroll_Biography =Paedophile Information Exchange= O'Carroll was working as a press officer for the Open University in the 1970s when he was told of the existence of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) after admitting he was a paedophile to lesbian members of the OU Women's Group. At that time, he was editor of the OU staff newspaper Open House and had been covering a Women's Group meeting on homosexuality.Paedophilia: The Radical Case, paperback edition, p. 208. In his book Paedophilia: The Radical Case, he writes: \\"The general public in the UK has long been aware of 'child-molesting' and 'perversion'. But only in the 1970s did it come to hear about 'paedophilia', a designation suddenly lifted from the obscurity of medical textbooks to become a crusading badge of identity for those whom the term had been designed to oppress\\". His activism with PIE cost him his job at the OU, and he was dismissed in February 1978. O'Carroll appealed to an industrial tribunal which ruled in May 1979 rejecting his complaint as he had placed himself in a position which meant that he could not do his job effectively because of his connection to PIE. At the time O'Carroll sat on the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) sub-committee for gay rights. However, NCCL's association with PIE was controversial internally. The Winter 1978 issue of Gay Left magazine reported that the NCCL executive had voted not to distribute a transcript of O'Carroll's speech to the organisation's 1977 conference in which he had objected to the punishment of sex offenders. Although PIE had campaigned for the age of consent to be lowered to 4 years old, O'Carroll stated that his personal view is that full sexual relations should be allowed at 12. =Paedophilia: The Radical Case= O'Carroll's book Paedophilia: The Radical Case was published in 1980. \\"I am not interested in why I am a paedophile\\", he writes \\"any more than others are interested in why they are 'normal'.\\" He advocates the normalisation of adult- child sexual relationships, and details his own illicit experiences. O'Carroll asserts his belief that each stage of the sexual relationship between an adult and child can be \\"negotiated\\", with \\"hints and signals, verbal and non-verbal, by which each indicates to the other what is acceptable and what is not... the man might start by saying what pretty knickers the girl was wearing, and he would be far more likely to proceed to the next stage of negotiation if she seemed pleased by the remark\\".Tom O'Carroll, Paedophilia: The Radical Case, Chapter 3, London: Peter Owen Ltd, 1980 (hardback); Boston, Mass.: Alyson Publications, 1982 (paperback). Mary-Kay Wilmers in the London Review of Books wrote: \\"Since Mr O‚ÄôCarroll sees nothing wrong with paedophilia, he isn‚Äôt interested in our sympathy; and since his opinion of the non-paedophile world is no higher than the opinion the non-paedophile world has of him, he doesn‚Äôt waste time trying to be conciliatory\\". At the time of its release, the book received mainstream reviews which were either scathingly dismissive,Charles Rycroft \\"Sensuality from the start\\", Times Literary Supplement, 21 November 1980John Rae, \\"Suffer little children\\", The Times Educational Supplement, 17 October 1980. like Wilmers, or supportive of the author, if not entirely of the \\"radical case\\" he had set out.Maurice Yaff√©, \\"'Age of Consent\\", New Statesman, 7 November 1980, p. 31.Eric Taylor \\"Too young to love?\\", New Society, 30 October 1980, p. 246. Sociologist Jeffrey Weeks described the book as \\"the most sustained advocacy\\" of \\"intergenerational sex\\", and stated that there were two powerful arguments against O'Carroll's views about the possibility of children consenting to sex: the feminist argument that \\"young people, especially young girls, do need protection from adult men in an exploitative and patriarchal society\\" and the argument that while adults are fully aware of the sexual connotations of their actions, young people are not, and that there is thus \\"an inherent and inevitable structural imbalance in awareness of the situation.\\"Jeffrey Weeks, Sexuality and Its Discontents, Routledge, London, 1993, pp.225-226 In 2003, The Guardian described it as \\"a book justifying the behaviour of those who prey on children.\\" =Conviction in 1981= In 1981, O'Carroll was convicted for conspiracy to corrupt public morals over the contact ads section of the PIE magazine and was imprisoned for two years. Since 2002 =Court case in 2002= In August 2002, O'Carroll was convicted at Southwark Crown Court of importing indecent photographs of children from Qatar, which had been found by Customs in October 2001 hidden in his luggage after his arrival at Heathrow Airport. In his packing cases, 94 full-frontal images of naked children aged between 2 and 10 were discovered, apparently taken without their consent or, the judge assumed, without that of their parents. According to O'Carroll, they were equivalent to an art exhibition. O'Carroll was sentenced to nine-months imprisonment on three counts. The conviction was later overturned in November 2002 by the Court of Appeal which held that the trial judge had been overly influenced by O'Carroll's campaigning. The photos were described in the ruling as having \\"the quality of indecency in the context in which they were taken, but were of the kind that parents might take of their children entirely innocently\\". O'Carroll's name was no longer required to be added to the Sex Offenders register.\\"Paedophile campaigner walks free\\", BBC online, 26 November 2002 (accessed 25 June 2009). In 2003, he made an extended appearance on the TV discussion programme After Dark in a BBC revival of the series, featuring Esther Rantzen and Helena Kennedy, among others. =Conviction in 2006= O'Carroll was convicted in 2006 of conspiring to distribute indecent photographs of children after supplying an undercover Metropolitan Police officer with a cache of child pornography obtained from his co-defendant Michael Studdert's secret vault containing 50,000 pornographic images. O'Carroll said the images with which he was connected had been in his possession for a \\"very long time\\". A new group O'Carroll was involved in running, International Paedophile Child Emancipation Group, and an offshoot, Gentlemen With An Interesting Name had been infiltrated by an undercover police officer. According to the police, O'Carroll considered the groups as an attempt at creating an \\"international secret society\\" of \\"academic\\" child abusers. O'Carroll was arraigned on 1 June 2006 on child pornography charges.Olivia Richwald \\"Police charge man over child sex ring\\", The Northern Echo, 1 June 2006. In September 2006, he admitted to two counts of distributing indecent images of children between 1994 and July 2005. On 20 December 2006, he was jailed for 2¬Ω years at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court.\\"Paedophile rights campaigner jailed for child porn distribution\\", breakingnews.ie, 20 December 2006. O'Carroll was placed on the sex offenders register for ten years and would be prevented from working with children in future. =Michael Jackson's Dangerous Liaisons= After a gestation of many years, O'Carroll's book on singer Michael Jackson was published in 2010 under the pen name Carl Toms.The identity of Carl Toms and Tom O'Carroll is confirmed in Michael Bailey's review of the book. The book, Michael Jackson's Dangerous Liaisons, concerns the entertainer's alleged intimate relationships with young boys. It was published in the UK by Troubador.\\"New Titles Spring 2010\\" Troubador Publishing Ltd. After publication, J. Michael Bailey, professor of psychology at Northwestern University, reviewed the book for the academic journal Archives of Sexual Behavior. Describing the author as \\"an unapologetic pedophile\\", Bailey observed that the book takes \\"a pro-pedophilic stance\\" and argues \\"persuasively\\" that Jackson was \\"almost certainly pedophilic\\". Bailey wrote, \\"The idea that pedophilic relationships can be harmless or even beneficial to children is disturbing to many people, including me.\\" But, he continued, \\"O‚ÄôCarroll argues against my intuitions and he argues well.\\"J. Michael Bailey. \\"Michael Jackson‚Äôs Dangerous Liaisons\\" (book review), Arch Sex Behav. DOI 10.1007/s10508-011-9842-1 In 2010, O'Carroll's writing was affected following complaints to Amazon.com about a book by another author, Phillip R. Greaves, which encouraged sexual contact between adults and children. After a campaign by outraged Amazon readers, Amazon dropped the book, along with several other books that appeared to promote paedophilia, including O'Carroll's earlier book, Paedophilia: The Radical Case.J. Michael Bailey. \\"Michael Jackson‚Äôs Dangerous Liaisons\\" (book review), p.3, Arch Sex Behav. DOI 10.1007/s10508-011-9842-1 In 2019, an independent documentary, Square One: Michael Jackson was released detailing connections with the 1993 allegations brought by Evan Chandler with an attendee of the 1986 NAMBLA conference, in which members were suggesting that if Jackson was perceived to be a paedophile, their movement would be better received by the general public. =Expulsion from the Labour Party= O'Carroll joined the Labour Party after Jeremy Corbyn became party leader in September 2015. When this became public knowledge on 16 February 2016, via a report in The Times, John Mann, the Labour Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw, and other party figures advocated his immediate expulsion. A Labour Party spokesman told ITV News a few hours later that O'Carroll had been suspended on the basis that he is a \\"safeguarding risk\\". The next day, the party confirmed that O'Carroll had been expelled.

Set in a Melbourne mental hospital in 1971, Cos√¨ is semi-autobiographical, and is the sequel to his previous semi-autobiographical play, Summer of the Aliens.In the introduction and blurb of Currency Press' published version of the play, it states that Cos√¨ is indeed a sequel to Summer of the Aliens, continuing the story of a much older Lewis. The play was adapted into the 1996 film Cosi.  Plot summary Set several years after the events of Summer of the Aliens, Lewis is now in a strained relationship with a bossy woman named Lucy, and in a friendship with political extremist, Nick. Lewis is always desperate for work as he states \\"I need the money\\". The venue is a theatre that smells of \\"burnt wood and mould\\", the cast are patients with very diverse needs, and the play is Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte. Through working with the patients, Lewis eventually discovers a new side of himself which allows him to become emotionally involved and to value love, while anti-Vietnam war protests erupt in the streets outside.  Characters  The patients make up a wide spectrum including Roy, a manic-depressive with a passion for theatre; Cherry, who has a food obsession and is a Lewis-addicted romantic; Ruth, suffering from obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD) and is shown as obsessed with counting and distinguishing between illusions and reality; Doug, a pyromaniac, who loves sexual innuendo; Julie, dependent on drugs in the outside world; Henry, an older, silent man, previously a lawyer; and Zac, a drugged-up pianist. Other characters include Justin, a social worker at the mental institution; Lewis's girlfriend Lucy and his best mate Nick, whose strongly left-wing ideals Lewis has followed up until now without question. Meeting patients with views different from Lucy's and Nick's opens Lewis' eyes to other people and the world around him, teaching him to be more tolerant.

It was established in 1984 by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), and was located at the ESO headquarters in Garching bei M√ºnchen, Germany. The ST-ECF ceased operations on 31 December 2010.http://www.stecf.org The ST-ECF provided detailed technical information about the HST and its science instruments, supported European astronomers who were preparing HST observing proposals and coordinated the development of computer software tuned to the specific data analysis needs of HST users. In all these duties the ST-ECF staff maintained close contacts with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, which is charged with the scientific operation of the HST observatory. The ST-ECF was last headed by Robert (Bob) Fosbury. Deputy was Jeremy Walsh. User support This view of the Cartwheel Galaxy was produced by ST-ECF from Hubble data, and released in December 2010. Founded before the era of the internet and widely available computer resources the ST-ECF was founded with user support for European astronomers as the main goal. When internet connections across the Atlantic and powerful computers became the mainstay, the focus of the organization shifted towards data product and dedicated instrument science support. Instrument science The ST-ECF was actively engaged in software development in many areas related to HST data calibration, analysis and visualisation for especially the Hubble instruments Faint Object Spectrograph, STIS, and Advanced Camera for Surveys. For example: * aXe ‚Äì Slitless Spectroscopy Extraction software * SLIM: A Slitless Spectroscopy Simulator for ACS * Faint Object Spectrograph Post Operational Archives calibration pipeline (included in STSDAS, done by the Instrument Physical Modeling Group) * The STIS Spectrograph calibration enhancement project (done by the Instrument Physical Modeling Group) * NICMOSlook and Calnic C * Lucy-Hook coaddition method Science archive Together with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) the ST-ECF operated and maintained the ESO/ST-ECF Science Archive Facility from where all the scientific data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope could be accessed by the public. In collaboration with the HST archives at the STScI and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) data products and access methods were continuously improved to assure the best possible science data for astronomers around the world. This includes work on the Virtual Observatory, On-The-Fly Calibration, and B Associations. Earlier work pioneered projects like Astrovirtel and Astrophysical Virtual Observatory. After the closure of ST-ECF the European HST Archive were moved to ESA's European Space Astronomy Centre in Spain, where most of ESA's Space Science Archives are located and operated from. Public outreach and education One of the groups at the ST- ECF was the Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre (HEIC), which, since 1999, has been the leading Hubble outreach activities group in Europe (headed by the science communication specialist Lars Lindberg Christensen and graphic designer Martin Kornmesser). HEIC's mission statement is to fulfill the Hubble Space Telescope outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. HEIC became a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. After the closure of ST-ECF the Outreach component continued on an ESO contract for ESA, as part of ESO's Education and Public Outreach department. The ESA/Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material ‚Äì press releases, images, brochures, web pages, books etc. ‚Äì suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provided a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page. The work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of European Space Agency‚Äôs Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more. All publicised material can be found on spacetelescope.org. The group is home to the FITS Liberator project and the \\"Hubble ‚Äì 15 Years of Discovery\\" project that also led to the book Hubble - 15 Years of Discovery.

The name derives from the club's design to fill the \\"gap\\" between sand and pitching wedges. History Over time the loft angle on irons in matched sets has been reduced for multiple reasons. Manufacturers, always wanting to advertise longer distances than their competitors, sometimes \\"cheat\\" by de-lofting their iron sets by a degree or two compared to their competitor's set, producing between 2-5 yards of extra distance per degree of \\"strengthening\\". In addition, several significant advances in clubhead design, most notably the 1970s development of investment- cast \\"cavity-back\\" designs, and the 1990s introduction of clubfaces that increased backspin to improve \\"bite\\", resulted in clubs with higher launch angles and flight paths for the same loft angle than their predecessors. Clubmakers then compensated for this in both cases by reducing loft, to translate that higher flight path into greater distance. Currently, the pitching wedge of a typical matched iron set has a loft similar to a 9-iron from the 1980s, at about 46 degrees, and much stronger lofts are found in game improvement sets. However, sand wedges generally have not received this same reduction in loft, even as they were designed with similar weight-distribution and backspin-improving features. This is because the sand wedge is typically not used with distance in mind; its eponymous purpose requires the traditional 54-56¬∞ loft angle in order to dig into the soft sand surrounding the ball and lift it out. The sand wedge's nominal loft and \\"bounce\\" angles have not changed appreciably from Gene Sarazen's original concept based on the niblick. Cavity-backed, perimeter-weighted sets may de-loft this club by a degree or two compared to a forged set, but this is nowhere near the amount of loft reduction seen in the numbered irons. This leaves a \\"gap\\" in loft angle between the pitching and sand wedges of up to 10 degrees, causing a distance difference with a full swing of up to 30 yards, both of which are differences normally seen between irons two or more loft numbers apart (e.g., between a 7 and 9 iron) instead of \\"adjacent\\" lofts as the PW and SW traditionally are. As a result, some players who had upgraded to these newer de-lofted iron sets began carrying the pitching wedge of an older set, lofted around 50-52¬∞, to \\"fill the gap\\". This additional wedge, with a full swing, falls between the average distances of a sand and pitching wedge, allowing the player to fine- tune their approach shot's distance without needing excessive variations in swing speed. Clubmakers, sensing an opportunity, began to offer a purpose- built wedge in this general loft range starting in the early to middle 1990s. These have become known colloquially as \\"gap wedges\\" due to their origin, despite various proprietary names applied to wedges in this class by their manufacturers. Design Gap wedges are loosely defined, but typically have the loft between that of a pitching wedge and sand wedge, between 50 and 54 degrees. At the extremes there is redundancy with either the pitching wedge (typically 48¬∞) or the sand wedge (typically 56¬∞), however some players will \\"fine-tune\\" the lofts of these other wedges to their play style, leading to alternate loft choices for a gap wedge. Most players look for a separation of 4 degrees between clubs, and so with the standard pitching and sand wedge lofts, the complementary gap wedge would be 52¬∞. Within the range of lofts seen in gap wedges, the angle that the sole makes to the ground at address, also known as the club's \\"bounce angle\\", varies from 0¬∞ up to 12¬∞ or more. Lower lofts typically benefit from a lower bounce angle, suiting their use as effectively an \\"11-iron\\" for shots from firmer lies such as grass. Higher lofts, generally used from softer lies where the ball may have dug itself in more, require a higher bounce similar to the sand wedge to dig in and then lift back out of the ground. The most common 52¬∞ wedge is sold in a wide range of bounce angles; 8¬∞ is a common \\"medium bounce\\" choice, allowing the golfer to use the club in a variety of lies, from the fairway or rough to \\"fried egg\\" semi-embedded sand or mud situations. The relation between actual loft and bounce can change based on how the player addresses the ball; the more forward the ball, and the more open the clubface, the higher the effective loft and bounce angles. Some clubmakers will vary the amount of bounce that the sole has from toe to heel, allowing the player to fine-tune the club to the specific situation by opening it. When square at address, such a club behaves more like a lower-bounce pitching wedge, while when opened, the club behaves more like a sand wedge (without the bounce becoming too high and making a \\"skulled\\" shot more likely, as it would with a constant bounce angle from tow to heel). A few manufacturers call attention to this by labeling the wedge \\"D\\" for \\"dual wedge\\", indicating it can be used as either a pitching or sand wedge (or anything in between). There is little consistency in labeling gap wedges; most manufacturers simply label the wedge with its angle, optionally including additional information about the amount of bounce (sometimes the angle measure, more often a series of one to three dots indicating \\"low\\", \\"medium\\" and \\"high\\" bounce). Some manufacturers call it an \\"Approach\\", \\"Attack\\" or \\"All\\" wedge, labeling it in these cases with \\"A\\". The Karsten Manufacturing Company, maker of the Ping brand of golf clubs, favored the use of \\"U\\" for \\"utility wedge\\", but currently only uses this label on wedges sold in matched sets; most individual Ping wedges are currently labelled with their angle. It is actually uncommon to find a gap wedge labeled \\"G\\"; Adams Golf, Cobra, Mizuno, and Wilson are among the few manufacturers that do so. Controversy The necessity of the gap wedge is contested by some golfers and clubfitters, who assert that this additional wedge would not be necessary if clubmakers had not de-lofted the clubs in the first place as a marketing move, to attract amateurs looking for more distance from each number. In addition, many matched sets do not include a gap wedge, when most clubmakers have included the pitching wedge since irons first began to be offered as matched numbered sets in the 1930s. The end result, critics claim, is that the 3 and 4-iron of a matched set have become just as hard to hit as the 1 and 2-irons of the 1970s, and with the average golfer carrying a set numbered between 4-iron and gap wedge, clubmakers might as well simply reduce all their labelled loft numbers by one, making the pitching wedge a 9-iron and the gap wedge a pitching wedge. Instead, most clubmakers continue to include the 3-iron and exclude the gap wedge from matched sets, which forces golfers to buy a 3-iron they are extremely unlikely to ever use, while not getting the much more important gap wedge and so having to buy it individually. For their part, clubmakers contest that the modern golfer demands customization; wedges (including gap wedges) are available in many combinations of loft and bounce angle, allowing the player to choose exactly the combination they find most useful. Including a 52-degree mid-bounce wedge in a matched set may prove useless to a golfer who prefers a different loft or bounce than this standard offering. They also contend that, adjusting for inflation ($1.00 in 1970 would have the same buying power as $6.13 in 2014), the price of a matched iron set has decreased over this time period, even as design and manufacturing advances have genuinely increased the distance and accuracy that the average golfer can expect, compared to a club of an older design but similar launch angle. They also assert that these design advances have made the modern long irons easier to hit well than older generations, so golfers should at least try these long irons before removing them from the bag. Lastly, some manufacturers do in fact include a gap wedge as part of a matched iron set, often removing the 3 iron to provide the same overall number of clubs in the set (and in response to the concern about including such a difficult-to-use club). Ping, for instance, offers its G-series iron sets in two loft ranges, 3-PW and 4-UW.

History =Early history= Coulby Newham began as farmland and this is reflected in the names of some of the streets such as Lingfield, Manor Farm Way and Paddock Wood. 'Colebi' and 'Nieweham', were separate medieval hamlets when identified in the Domesday Book of 1086, formerly covered this site. The agricultural legacy of the area, reminiscent indeed of that of the entire wider Middlesbrough area, is still touched on today by the working Newham Grange Leisure farm, itself harking as far back to life in this particular spot of rural North Yorkshire as the 17th century. Only as the 1970s dawned, in the shadow of the rest of modern Middlesbrough's continual southerly urban expansion, did this change. Coulby Newham developed after the building of the A174 Parkway (after which the suburb's shopping Mall, the Parkway Shopping Centre, opened in 1986, was subsequently named). =Education= The first major building in Coulby Newham was Coulby Newham Secondary School (replaced in 2003 by The King's Academy).The King's Academy Official website Coulby Newham Secondary opened with Year 7-10 in the late 1970s, receiving many students that had been excluded from Acklam schools Hustler and Boynton. The school began with many young teachers and in its formative years was a successful school which was at the centre of the growing community of Coulby Newham. There are now three primary schools; Sunnyside Primary School, Rose Wood Academy and St Augustine's RC School. The suburb also contains two churches, Coulby Newham Baptist Church and a Roman Catholic cathedral. =Food chains= Coulby Newham remains a rapidly developing suburb of Middlesbrough, Tesco choosing to locate a new ¬£2m store in the area in 2005. There are many new private housing developments in the suburbs, making Coulby Newham spread in the direction of Great Ayton and other villages close to the hills. Other large chain stores developed in Coulby Newham include Pets at Home, Halfords, Boyes, Home Bargains, Burger King, McDonald's, KFC, Poundland, Greggs, Cooplands, Specsavers, Costa and Subway. =Farm fire (2017)= In July 2017, a series of arson attacks took place at Newham Hall Farm; a 12-year-old boy was found responsible for one of the blazes, and two other boys of the same age were interviewed in connection with the fires.

After spending two hours in orbit around the Earth, the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V was reignited to send them to the Moon. During the retrieval of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) from its stowed position below the command and service module (CSM), a light came on on the control panel that indicated the valves of the service propulsion system were open and the engine should be firing. A short was found in a switch that controlled the redundant valves for the engine. New procedures were developed to deal with this. During their first inspection of the LM, Scott and Irwin found that the glass cover of a tapemeter had broken forcing them to clean up the glass shards lest they breathe them in. On the fourth day they entered into lunar orbit and prepared for lunar descent. Launch and trans-lunar injection The crew were awakened at 4:19 am EST. After brief medical exams, they ate breakfast with the backup and support crews. They then put on their space suits and were taken by van to the launch site, where they arrived at 6:45 am. This was about two-and-a-half hours before launch. During the launch phase of the flight, Scott sat in the left-hand seat of the CSM, Worden in the center seat, and Irwin in the right- hand seat. Apollo 15 was launched at 9:34:00 am EST on July 26, 1971. One of the few problems encountered during the launch phase came at the separation of the first and second stages. Solid-fuel ullage rockets had been removed from the interstage between the first and second stages. These rockets were used to settle the fuel and oxidizer in the S-II. The first stage also carried only four retrorockets whereas previous missions had used eight. The first stage engines did not cutoff cleanly, taking over four seconds to drop from 2% thrust to zero. This meant that the S-IC was closer to the S-II than planned and the ignition of the second stage disabled the telemetry package on the first stage. Eleven minutes and 34 seconds after launch the crew were in their Earth parking orbit 92.5 by 91.5 nm (171.3 by 169.5 km). An orbit of this height is not sustainable for very long due to friction with the Earth's atmosphere, but the crew would only spend three hours before reigniting the S-IVB third stage to put them on a lunar-bound trajectory. About 485 lb (220 kg) of liquid oxygen (LOX) was lost through an open vent of the S-IVB after the rocket was pitched down too quickly after cutoff. One of the windows of the Apollo 15 CSM was specifically designed to transmit ultraviolet radiation, permitting the crew to acquire UV photographs of the Earth and the Moon. These photographs began as soon as they reached Earth orbit and would continue throughout the mission. During times when they were not using the window, Mission Control had them place a cover over the window that blocked the UV, in an effort to minimize their exposure. Two hours, 50 minutes and 2.6 seconds after launch the S-IVB reignited and burned for 5 minutes and 49 seconds. The burn increased the spacecraft's speed from 25,620 feet per second (7,809 m/s) to 35,522 feet per second (10,827 m/s). The altitude had been raised to 167.4 nautical miles (310.0 km). Engine problems The next major task for the crew was transposition, docking, and extraction. The lunar module sat below the command and service module, head-to-tail. As such, it was required for the CSM to separate from the S-IVB, travel a short distance, turn 180 degrees and then dock with and extract the lunar module. First the CSM separated, taking ten minutes to turn, come back and hard dock. About half an hour later, after pressurizing the lunar module and checking the integrity of the docking latches, the crew extracted Falcon from the S-IVB. The S-IVB would be put on a trajectory so that it would impact the lunar surface at 3¬∞39'S, 7¬∞35'W. It was sometime during the transposition and docking that the \\"SPS Thrust\\" light on the entry monitor system part of the control panel came on. The service propulsion system (SPS) was the rocket engine of the CSM and this particular light was used to indicate the valves in the engine were open and that the rocket should be firing, something that was not in fact happening. As a precaution the crew opened the circuit breakers that controlled the valves to stop them being opened by a short circuit and causing the engine to fire. After some period of troubleshooting it was determined that there was a short circuit in the \\"Delta-V Thrust\\" switch. This switch opened the valves in the SPS. With the cause being in the switch it meant that the engine itself was fine, but new procedures would have to be used when operating the engine to stop accidental ignition. One of the reasons for the success of the Apollo program was the redundancy of critical systems--in the case of the SPS, there were two independent valve systems for the engine. The short in the switch only affected one of these sets of valves and as such it was still possible to fire the engine. But instead of having both sets of valves open at the start of each ignition, only the trouble-free valves would be used. For long burns, the valves affected by the short would be opened only after ten seconds, and closed before the end of the burn. Mission Control decided to cancel the first midcourse correction (MCC-1). This would give them a chance to fire the SPS engine at the second planned correction. This cancellation meant that tasks that would have been done later could be brought forward and the crew could get to sleep sooner. These tasks included a water dump and putting the spacecraft into passive thermal control (PTC) or what was often called \\"barbecue mode\\", as the spacecraft was put into a slow roll so that there was even heat distribution. Nearly 15 hours after launch, the crew switched off the lights in the cabin and went to sleep. Day 2 The second day of Apollo 15 centered around the second planned midcourse correction and a preliminary check of the lunar module, Falcon. Mission Control first got the crew to perform a 0.7 second burn of the SPS engine before the planned second course correction. This was designed to isolate the location of the short in the Delta-V Thrust switch. The burn allowed Mission Control to confirm that the SPS would only be ignited accidentally if the faulty switch was armed. It was found after the flight that a 0.06 inch (1.4 mm) length of wire had found its way into the switch, and had shorted it. The engine burn itself was good enough, adding 5.3 ft/s (1.62 m/s) to their speed, that Mission Control cancelled the planned second and third course corrections. After venting the atmosphere of the lunar module overboard (in case there was some contamination in the spacecraft), and then replenishing it from the CSM, the crew removed the hatch between Endeavour and Falcon and entered the LM. Scott and Irwin checked the switch settings in the LM to make sure none had changed since launch and also checked the electrical, environmental and communications systems. They found that a glass cover on one of the tapemeters had broken and that there was glass in the cabin. This did not impair the meter's use, but was of concern, as glass could be inhaled by the crew or get into the environmental systems. After replacing the hatch, the crew ate and went to bed to end their first full day in space. Day 3 The \\"morning\\" of the third day centered around an \\"eye flash\\" experiment. Some previous crews had experienced bright flashes even when they closed their eyes. Irwin reported that he had seen them during the two previous sleep periods. The experiment involves the crew facing in the same direction, wearing blindfolds and having placed shades over the windows. They described the position, color and time of the flashes. They spent an hour doing this. It is thought that the flashes were caused by Cherenkov radiation from high energy cosmic rays passing through the eyes. The crew entered Falcon for a second time. Mission Control had them vacuum the spacecraft and then leave the vacuum cleaner running while they did the rest of their \\"housekeeping\\". This was in an effort to remove any glass particles left in the cabin. During this period, the spacecraft passed the point when the lunar gravity becomes stronger than that of the Earth's as felt by Apollo 15. After a quiet day, the crew had some problems after they discovered a water leak. Due to zero-gravity the water was just a large ball, and although the spacecraft was water-resistant, if it had grown too large and broken apart, water everywhere would have been unpleasant for the crew. The leak came from a loose fitting on the chlorine injector outlet. During the flight the crew would add chlorine to the water to stop any bacterial or fungal growths. The place where this was injected into the tank had come loose. Day 4 and LOI The fourth day saw the fourth planned midcourse correction, although it was only the second actually performed on the mission. The burn lasted 0.91 seconds, adding 5.4 ft/s (1.65 m/s) to their speed. The crew then put on their A7L space suits for the jettisoning of the SIM bay door. This door was jettisoned using explosive cord and there was a small risk that it could cause the spacecraft to depressurize. It was possible, in an emergency for the crew to spend the cruise back to Earth in their pressurized space suits. The major event of day 4 was lunar orbit insertion (LOI). Occurring behind the Moon, out of contact with the Earth, this engine burn put the spacecraft into orbit around the Moon. It was the first test of the new procedures for using both SPS during a long burn. Loss of signal (LOS) was at 78 hours, 23 minutes and 31 seconds GET as the spacecraft went behind the Moon as seen from the Earth. This was about 8 minutes before LOI. As with all the LOI performed during Project Apollo it was perfect, the SPS burned for 6 minutes and 38 seconds, placing them into a 169 by 59 nautical miles (313 by 109.3 km) orbit. Carmichael and Hill. The black shape on the left is a thruster on the LM. The photo was taken during the 13th orbit of the Moon, by Dave Scott. Much of the first hour or so in lunar orbit was spent describing the landforms over which they were orbiting. The crew had become highly trained field geologists, especially Worden who spent time observing the Earth from an airplane, trained by Farouk El-Baz. They also photographed many features, with this crew being the first to enter into a highly inclined orbit. Previous Apollo crews had been in lunar orbits that were just over equatorial regions. The descent orbit insertion (DOI) burn was performed behind the Moon on the second orbit. This burn placed them into a 58.8 by 9.5 nautical mile (108.9 by 17.6 km) orbit, with the low point over Hadley Rille landing site. On Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 this burn was done by the lunar module after it had undocked from the CSM. From Apollo 14 onwards, it was done by the CSM as a way of conserving fuel on the LM, allowing it to land with more equipment and consumables on board. A major issue for all lunar orbiting spacecraft are mass concentrations or mascons. These are regional areas where denser material is under the surface. Apollo 15 travelled over regions that had never been covered on previous flights, so it was unknown how its orbit would be affected by them. Mission Control predicted that by the time the crew awoke the next \\"morning\\", the lowest point of their orbit, perilune, would have dropped to about 8.6 nm (16.1 km) but this turned out to be an underestimate. Lunar orbit up to PDI During the crew's sleep period, the mass spectrometer was collecting the prime part of its data. The spacecraft was kept in a perfect attitude for the instrument which was designed to investigate the extremely tenuous lunar atmosphere. The \\"Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report\\" said that most of the measurements of gas made by the spectrometer were actually caused by the spacecraft itself. The crew was woken 18 minutes early when it was found that their orbit had decayed to 58.8 by 7.6 nm (108.8 by 14.1 km). The low point was lower than planned for and the crew had to perform a small trim burn to raise this. This was done on the opposite side of the Moon to their landing site at the end of their ninth orbit of the Moon. It was a 20-second burn of the reaction control system (RCS) and added 3.1 ft/s (0.94 m/s) to their speed. It raised the lowest point of their orbit to about 9.6 nm (17.8 km). During the eleventh orbit, Scott and Irwin began to transfer to Falcon. The crew spent the period behind the Moon activating the LM and general housekeeping in preparation for the undocking. They also updated the guidance computer on the LM and made landmark sightings to improve the accuracy of the known position of the landing site. Undocking was meant to come at the end of their eleventh orbit of the Moon, but was delayed by an improperly attached umbilical that sent the signal to the docking probe to disengage. After Worden fixed the connection, undocking and separation occurred properly about half an orbit late. The only effect of the late separation was the need to delay some landmark sighting by one orbit. At the end of the twelfth orbit, Worden performed a circularization burn with SPS, raising the perilune of his orbit. The reason for this was that in the case of an abort during landing by Falcon, a circular orbit is much easier for rendezvous than to an elliptic orbit. Without the LM, the SPS only had to burn for 4 seconds, raising its orbit to 65.2 by 54.8 nm (120.7 by 101.4 km). During the 13th orbit, Worden placed Endeavour into the science collecting attitude. On Falcon, Scott and Irwin continued to check the spacecraft, and prepared for powered descent, when they would burn the descent engine of the LM to begin their landing.

This dialect is often hard to understand for people outside the region where it is spoken due to heavy assimilation and elision. The term also refers to the inhabitants of Minas Gerais. History Minas Gerais was settled during the late 17th and early 18th centuries by a mix of recent Portuguese immigrants ( or ) and earlier colonists that came from S√£o Paulo (). There was an intense rivalry between the two groups, fighting over the gold mines (from which the name of the province was taken, Minas Gerais means \\"General Mines\\"). These conflicts required the intervention of the Portuguese Crown after a serious uprisal developed into civil war (Guerra dos Emboabas) with the final defeat of the paulistas in 1708. In the 19th century, the state was being forgotten due to the decline of gold mining. Due to this isolation, the state was influenced by the dialect of Rio de Janeiro in the southeast, while the south and the Triangulo Mineiro region, began to speak the rustic dialect of S√£o Paulo (caipira). The central region of Minas Gerais, however, developed their own dialect, which is known as Mineiro or mountain dialect. This dialect is also present in cities of the center and southest of the state, which is surrounded by mountains and mines. Recently, the influence of mineiro has been increasing and spreading, due to local pride and rejection of other accents.

Fenton (December 15, 1908 ‚Äì June 17, 2005) was an American scholar and writer known for his extensive studies of Iroquois history and culture. He started his studies of the Iroquois in the 1930s and published a number of significant works over the following decades. His final work was published in 2002. During his career, Fenton was director of the New York State Museum and a professor of anthropology at the State University of New York. Early career (1908‚Äì1955) Fenton was born William Nelson Fenton in New Rochelle, New York, in 1908. The Fenton family had had interactions with the Seneca people since the 1860s. He grew up in the west of New York State, where the Seneca had their traditional territory. After attending local schools, he studied at Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1931. He went on for graduate study and earned a doctorate in anthropology from Yale University in 1937. During the 1930s, Fenton lived among the Seneca in western New York, becoming fluent in their language and doing field studies. The Seneca nation adopted Fenton into the Hawk clan on January 26, 1934. This was the same clan that had adopted Lewis Henry Morgan. Fenton soon became known as a leader of studies of the Iroquois. Fenton wrote a number of position papers during the 1940s and 1950s that outlined problems and issues relating to Iroquois studies which required further work. He encouraged other students of the Iroquois to meet and discuss issues of concern in the field, notably in meetings at Red House in New York. Fenton focused attention on such issues as diversity in culture and connections between northern and southern tribes. In his work as an ethnologist with the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology, Fenton drew attention to existing historic and ethnographic sources. During the 1930s and 1940s, Fenton undertook substantial studies of Iroquois music and dance while working at the Smithsonian. Later career (1956‚Äì2005) After becoming senior ethnologist at the Smithsonian Institution in the 1950s, he went to work at the New York State Museum at Albany. Becoming director, he developed an extensive collection of Iroquois materials. Some tribal representatives criticized Fenton for failing to return artifacts. He regarded museums as necessary safeguards for cultural heritage. Some tribal leaders also criticized him for revealing too much material about sacred rituals. Fenton chaired the Committee on Anthropological Research in Museums (CARM) from 1965 to 1973, during the majority of its life. CARM, a subcommittee of the American Anthropological Association, encouraged scholarly use of museums and museum collections in anthropological research. CARM also encouraged the early use of computers in documenting and inventorying museums collections across North America. In 1965 Fenton was awarded the Cornplanter Medal. Fenton left the New York State Museum to become Professor of Anthropology at the State University of New York at Albany. He worked there until his retirement in 1979. He remained active in continued research and writing about the Iroquois. He published The Great Law and the Longhouse: A Political History of the Iroquois in 1998 when he was nearly 90. He died on June 17, 2005 in Cooperstown, New York, at the age of 96, on the way to the hospital. Publications Fenton wrote extensively on Iroquois ethnology, historiography, the history of anthropology, and museum anthropology for several decades. Some of his works include: * An Outline of Seneca ceremonies at Coldspring Longhouse, 1936, work at Yale University, studying for his doctorate.

It is a thin and long thrusting sword, generally used by a type of heavy cavalry (husaria, the famed Polish hussars) and optimized to defeat body armor (either by piercing directly through mail links, or by thrusting between the plates of plate armor), but not used to cut or slash. The koncerz originated from a medieval sword and appeared at the end of the 15th century when it was about long, and relatively unwieldy compared to single-handed thrusting swords designed for use by infantry. By the late 16th century it had increased in length to a typical overall‚Äî blade‚Äîand had a more optimized weight distribution and balance. The koncerz was used more like a lance while on horseback; it provided a rider with a very long reach in a relatively compact format suitable for a sidearm (the typical primary weapon of hussars was a very long lance). Since it was optimized for thrusting, the koncerz had no cutting edge, only a very sharp point; the blade itself was triangular or square in cross section in order to be more rigid.

The screenplay by John Kostmayer is loosely based on an attempted murder that happened in 1983, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where Frances Toto repeatedly tried to kill her husband, Anthony. She spent four years in prison for attempted murder and was released in 1988. Plot Joey Boca (Kevin Kline) is the owner of a pizza parlor located in Tacoma, Washington, and has been married to Rosalie (Tracey Ullman) for years. Their marriage seems a typical one until Rosalie discovers in the public library that Joey is a womanizer and has been cheating on her for a long time, and with multiple women. Rosalie does not want to allow Joey the pleasure of having every woman he wants, so she refuses divorce. Taking extreme measures, she enlists the help of her mother (Joan Plowright), and her young co-worker Devo (River Phoenix), who's secretly in love with her, to kill Joey in order to put an end to his infidelity. They also hire two incompetent, perpetually stoned hit-men, cousins Harlan and Marlon James (William Hurt and Keanu Reeves). To her surprise, Joey proves impossible to kill. Even though Rosalie poisons Joey with sleeping pills, he simply gets a stomach cramp, and dismisses it as a virus. They then ask Devo to come over and shoot Joey, but Devo looks away and only ends up wounding Joey behind the ear. When Marlon's cowardice stops him from being present at Joey's murder, Harlan shoots Joey through the chest, missing the intended target of the heart. Eventually a convict at the local commissary reveals their plan, and when the police arrive they find the wounded Joey in some pain. Joey is taken to the hospital, and Rosalie, her mother, Devo, and the James cousins are arrested. Recognizing the errors in his ways and at his mother's behest, Joey refuses to press charges and bails everyone out of jail. As he waits for Rosalie with flowers and a box of chocolates, he meets the James, with whom he makes peace. After meeting Rosalie again, he asks her to take him back, but still offended, she runs out. Joey manages to catch her and in the janitors' closet they reveal their love with some intimacy, much to Devo's dismay and the surprise of Rosalie's mother. Cast Reception =Box office= The film earned $4 million on its opening weekend and grossed over $16 million in North America. =Critical response= I Love You to Death received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 56% based on reviews from 25 critics. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C on scale of A to F. Jonathan Rosenbaum, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, described the film as a \\"fair- to-middling black comedy\\" and that \\"although the pacing is sluggish in spots, people with a taste for acting as impersonation will enjoy some of the scenery chewing‚Äîespecially by Plowright, Kline, and Hurt\\". Roger Ebert describes the film as \\"an actor's dream\\" but isn't quite so sure it is a dream film for an audience. He praises Ullman for her performance, noting it is all the more effective against the overtly comic performance of Kline. Ebert remarks \\"William Hurt could have walked through the role of the spaced-out hit man, but takes the time to make the character believable and even, in a bleary way, complex\\". Ebert suggests Kasdan was attracted to the script because it seems almost impossible to direct, and although he is not sure it succeeds, it is certainly not boring.

The white-collared mangabey was declared a separate species by the IUCN in 2016, but it retains the endangered conservation status. Habitat and ecology The sooty mangabey is native to tropical West Africa, being found in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. It lives in both old growth and secondary forests as well as in flooded, dry, swamp, mangrove, and gallery forests. The primate is arboreal and diurnal. They are omnivores whose diet includes primarily fruits and seeds, sometimes feeding on small animals. They live in social groups of four to twelve individuals, but occasionally groups as large as 95 individuals have been recorded. Taxonomy There are two distinctive subspecies of this mangabey, and it is possible they should be considered separate species. Both were formerly considered subspecies of a widespread Cercocebus torquatus. * Cercocebus atys atys (west of the Sassandra River) * White-collared (or White-crowned) mangabey, Cercocebus atys lunulatus (east of the Sassandra River). Disease Sooty mangabeys are naturally infected with a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), known as SIVsmm. Due to extensive human-mangabey contact in sub-Saharan Africa, SIVsmm has jumped from this species into humans on many occasions, resulting in HIV-2 virus. The HIV-1 strain by contrast came from the common chimpanzee strain of SIV. The sooty mangabey can also contract leprosy, as can humans, the nine- banded armadillo, the common chimpanzee, and the crab-eating macaque. Status The sooty mangabey is believed to be decreasing in numbers as its forest habitat is degraded, with trees being felled for firewood and timber, and it is hunted for food in some parts of its range. It is more terrestrial than some of its relatives and sometimes raids farms, which brings it into conflict with humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as vulnerable.

It is inserted into a specially prepared hole, or seating, in the top of a stone, preferably above its centre of mass. It works by applying principles of the lever and utilises the weight of the stone to act on the long lever-arms which in turn results in a very high reaction force and friction where the short lever-arms make contact with the stone inside the hole and thereby prevents slipping. Etymology The name lewis may come from the Latin levo -avi, -atum meaning to levitate or lift, but the Oxford English Dictionary Online states, \\"the formation and the phonology are not easily explained on this hypothesis\\", preferring \\"origin obscure\\", and speculating that the term may derive from a personal name. The Romans used the lewis. The specially shaped hole that is shaped to fit the device is known as a lewis hole. Lewis holes in the uppermost masonry coursings are neatly repaired with matching indented plugs after the stone has been set in place. Use A lewis is most useful when it is not possible to lift the stone with chains or slings, because of either the location or shape of the stone, or delicate projections. Examples include the closing stone in a string course, cylindrical column drums, decorated column capitals, and coping stones in a pediment. Heavy ashlar stones are also bedded using a lewis. The lewis is liable to slip out of the seating if some of the weight of the stone is subtracted from the appliance, such as when the stone bumps on the scaffolding on its way up to its final location. For this reason, a safety sling should always be used together with the lewis until the stone is reasonably close to its final position. Lifting the stone a small distance from the ground before hoisting is the best way to test a lewis. Any sign of looseness or damage should be corrected by adjusting the lewis hole or packing the lewis with metal shims. Bedding a stone using a lewis: The stone is placed on dunnage laid flat with enough clearance for a mortar bed to be placed beneath it. The safety straps are removed, the stone is lifted using the lewis alone, and the dunnage removed with fingers clear. The stone is then lowered onto the mortar bed, and positioned with sharp taps from a rubber mallet. Types of lewis There are a number of different types of lewis used in the stonemasonry trade: =Chain-linked lewis= A chain-linked lewis or chain lewis is made from two curved steel legs, linked by three steel rings. The legs fit into a seating cut in the top of the stone, above the centre of mass. When the top of the curved legs are pulled together by the rings, the bottom portions are forced into the lower part of the seating, thereby providing enough friction to lift the stone. =Split-pin lewis= The split-pin lewis is similar to the chain- linked lewis in that it uses a scissor-like action to produce friction against the inside of the lewis hole. The two legs, semicircular in section, lie side- by-side, and fit inside a hole drilled in the stone. This type of lewis seating is the simplest to prepare, requiring a single drilled hole. =Two- pinned lewis= A two-pinned lewis consists of two pins, linked by a short chain. The pins are inserted into opposing holes that are drilled into the top of the stone at about 15¬∞ from vertical. It operates by gripping the stone (like two fingers lifting a tenpin bowling ball) as the weight of the stone is taken up by a crane or winch. The advantage of using this type of lewis is that it is simple to prepare: two angled drill holes are all that is necessary. Like other types of lewis, it is susceptible to pulling out as the stone is lifted. It should always be tested before hoisting, and used in conjunction with safety slings. =Three-legged lewis= A three-legged lewis, also known as a dovetailed lewis, St Peter's keys, or a Wilson bolt fits into a dovetailed seating in the top of a building stone. It is made from three pieces of rectangular-section -thick steel legs held together with a shackle, allowing connection to a lifting hook. The middle leg is square throughout its length, while the outer legs are thinner at the top, flaring towards the bottom. Held together, the three legs thus form a dovetail shape. The lewis hole seating is undercut (similar to a chain-linked lewis hole) to match its profile. The first outer leg is inserted into the lewis hole, followed by the second outer leg. The inner (parallel) leg is inserted last, pushing the outer legs into contact with the inside of the lewis hole. The shackle is unbolted, placed over the legs, and the bolt fastened through both the shackle eyes and the eye in the top of each leg. (See gallery below for diagram.) This type of lewis is the safest to use because it relies on its dovetailed shape for security instead of friction alone, but the seating is time-consuming to prepare. Their resemblance, once assembled, to a bunch of keys gave rise to an alternative name for them of \\"St Peter's keys\\". This has frequently been represented allegorically, drawing the name of \\"St. Peter\\" as \\"the Rock on which I shall found my Church\\" into an allegory between the fabric of a church building and the community of the church itself. Some illustrations of St Peter even show him carrying a bunch of keys which appear to have no wards. These are not keys in the lock-making sense, but in this sense of stonemasonry. =External lewis= The external lewis, kerb lifter or slab lifter is a type of lifting device used in the stonemasonry trade since Medieval times. The external lewis was originally shaped like a pair of scissor-tongs, and swung from a treadwheel crane.Gunther Binding published this example of an external lewis hanging from a tripod in \\"Medieval Building Techniques\\" (Tempus Publishing). This type of tong device has been known as dogs and the holes in the stone as dog holes for many centuries. Many old bridges and walls in UK still have dog holes to reveal how the stones were lifted particularly onto bridge parapets. The external lewis has been modified to handle kerbstones and large slabs of polished stone in contemporary stone yards. A kerb lifter lifting kerb stones in Hainan, China. A manual kerb lifter is a large, adjustable pair of tongs, made with a pair of handles so that two men can manoeuvre heavy blocks of stone into position. A mechanical kerb lifter can also be made to fit mechanical lifters like forklifts or crane-trucks so that larger stones can be placed. In stone yards, a slab lifter is hung from a shed gantry or forklift to transport slabs of stone between storage racks and stone processing machines. It consists of two hinged, weighted friction pads that close astride the top of a slab, and are pulled tightly together by the weight of the slab itself. The slab lifter uses two safety devices. Safety chains and a support bracket allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting appliance also has a safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated by the weight of the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/gmd2007/vgmd26.pdf Gallery File:Lewis Hole Indents.JPGIndented lewis holes File:CWO (3).JPG A split-pin lewis placed in the top of an altar stone File:Louve de carrier.JPGa French- type chain-linked lewis File:Wilson bolt.jpgSt Peter's keys in the Duomo, Florence File:Three-legged lewis diagram - 02.pngThe principle of the three- legged lewis.

Fishing Port Lochinver is the second largest fishing port in Scotland; frequented by European fishermen primarily from Spain and France. Lochinver underwent a major renewal project in the 1990s where the harbour area was rebuilt and a new and much improved loading area was created. This new development involved blasting an area of several hectares out of the surrounding rock. At present the area is mostly undeveloped, with the exception a new Sports Centre. The back of Lochinver is a beautiful part of Assynt with local tourism and nature areas being developed in conjunction with small-scale forestry activities. Birdlife in Lochinver includes the curlew, oystercatcher and hooded crow. Local Villages Other local villages include Inverkirkaig - accessed by the road leading up the River Culag - and on the coastal road north: Achmelvich, Clachtoll, Clashmore, Stoer, Clashnessie, Drumbeg and Culkein Drumbeg. Old Railway Link In the 1890s, it was suggested that a railway be constructed from Invershin to Lochinver, to 'open up' the Highlands and provide a direct rail connection with ferries to the Western Isles. This scheme was as an alternative to a proposed route to Ullapool from Garve. In the event, neither were able to obtain funding.

They are a common species, often considered a pest of domestic houses and, particularly, natural history museums, where the larvae may damage natural fibers and can damage carpets, furniture, clothing, and insect collections. A. verbasci was also the first insect to be shown to have an annual behavioral rhythm and to date remains a classic example of circannual cycles in animals. Description Larval form of Anthrenus verbasci (4.6 mm long) Adult A. verbasci range in length from . The body is rounded, almost spherical. The elytra and pronotum are covered in fine scales of different colours, creating an irregular pattern of white, brownish and yellowish patches on these features. The white scales are focussed along the lateral margins of the pronotum and on the elytra, where they form three bright, wavy transverse bands. In addition to these morphological features, their antennae are 11-segmented, with a club of 3 segments. The larval form of A. verbasci, commonly known as 'woolly bears' (a name shared with the larvae of Arctia caja and many other moths of the subfamily Arctiinae), measures up to in length. The larvae are elongated and densely covered in large setae (hairs). These hairs are organised into alternating, transverse groups of light and dark-brown patches: the larva appears covered in brown stripes. The body is usually wider at the back than at the front where it also bears 3 pairs of hair tufts along its rear abdomen that can be used for self-defense. =Life cycle= Larva of A. verbasci. Front view A. verbasci has a life cycle ranging from 1‚Äì3 years, depending upon the environmental conditions. A study in 1958 found that temperature is able to affect larval development, concluding that the periods of incubation and pupation of A. verbasci decrease with increase of temperature (the life cycle is thus quickened with a modern rise in temperature). Incubation decreased from 54 days at 15 ¬∞C to 12 days at 30 ¬∞C, and the pupation decreased from 89 days at 10 ¬∞C to 9 days at 25 ¬∞C. Relative humidity was shown to have little effect. Larvae hatch from eggs in the spring and early summer, often in the nests of birds (including those of the house sparrow and house swift) or around stored fabrics. Adults emerge between late May and early August (in England), flying to and feeding on the pollen and nectar of flowering plants. The life expectancy of the beetle is about two weeks. During this period, mating occurs and the eggs are laid, either close to the human environs or in bird nests, tree hollows and similar, dry places where larvae can find their food. Then the cycle begins anew. Distribution and habitat This species is present in most of Europe, in the eastern Palearctic realm, in the Near East, in the Nearctic realm, in North Africa and in North Asia, also in the Neotropics.Robinson, W. Handbook of Urban Insects. p.98 Diet and behaviour Larvae feed on keratin and chitin of natural fibers (dead insects, animal hair and feathers) throughout their development, eventually experiencing a dormancy period (also known as diapause) prior to pupation into the adult stage. The length of the dormancy appears to depend on environmental factors, with the most likely zeitgeber being photoperiod. Adults feed on the pollen and nectar of flowering plants. =Predators= Among the natural predators of A. verbasci, one of the most well-studied is the parasitoid wasp Laelius pedatus (in the family Bethylidae). Upon discovering an A. verbasci larva, a female wasp will land on the larva's dorsal side and attempt to line up its long, stinger-like ovipositor for a paralyzing blow to the thorax. In response, the larva will erect long hairs on their abdomen and attempt to brush these hairs against the encroaching wasp. The hairs detach and stick to the wasp on contact, presumably causing some sort of irritation. Evidently, such irritation is not enough to deter an attack on A. verbasci larvae, as the vast majority of attacks are successful. By comparison, the closely related beetle species Anthrenus flavipes ‚Äì which has slightly longer hairs than A. verbasci ‚Äì uses such a defense more effectively. After a single successful sting, the beetle is permanently paralyzed. The entire process from landing to complete paralysis lasts approximately 40 seconds. L. pedatus does not lay eggs immediately after the beetle is paralyzed, waiting as long as 24 hours before oviposition. During this time, she grooms herself, removing any hairs that might have stuck to her during the attack. During this lengthy process she appears to monitor the larva's state of paralysis by repeatedly biting it and monitoring its reaction. Once sufficiently clear of hairs, the wasp creates a bare patch on the larva's abdomen and lays 2‚Äì4 eggs. Eggs hatch in 3‚Äì4 days and the larvae feed on the beetle for 3‚Äì7 days, eventually killing the host. They then spin cocoons near the empty shell of the host, emerging some time later as adult wasps. Interaction with humans =As a domestic pest= Anthraenus verbasci caught on a sticky blunder trap in a museum. The larvae of A. verbasci are a common household pest. Adult beetles usually lay their eggs in air ducts, in closets, under furniture, or under baseboards. Once hatched and until they pupate into adults, the larvae hide in dark, undisturbed areas and feed on organic material. The larvae are thus responsible for the damage of various items, such as furniture, clothing, blankets, furs, and carpets. They are commonly found in musical instruments which have been stored for lengthy periods of time, feeding on pads and felts most commonly found in woodwind instruments. =As a museum pest= Collections of specimens, especially of insects, are also vulnerable to attack, making A. verbasci a common pest in museums. In a 1987 survey of British national history museums, at least five noted that A. verbasci was categorised as a major pest for biological collections. Larvae are often found in the nests of sparrows and wagtails, and so larvae and adults may enter museums at upper levels through windows and roof spaces. Infestations can be prevented by removing the larvae and adults through regular vacuum cleaning, dry cleaning or airing clothing outside, placing naphthalene balls in closets, and removing abandoned bird and insect nests attached to the building. Signs of an infestation include the presence of damaged articles, moulted larval skins in dark areas, and an abundance of adult beetles near windows. Susceptible people may also find that hairs shed from the larvae cause irritated itchy welts that may be confused with bedbug bites. Deterring or killing A. verbasci can be accomplished using insecticides, oxygen deprivation, freezing, and pheromone and scent traps.

Chainsaws incorporate numerous safety features common to many engine-driven power tools. Manufacturers have invented numerous design features to improve safety. Some features have become de facto standards, and others are legal requirements in particular jurisdictions. Best practice dictates that an operator should inspect the saw before starting work and only operate the saw if all the safety features are properly functional. Additional safety features are a significant commercial advantage to chainsaw producers. Companies continue to develop new features over time. Most chainsaw safety features are focused on the kickback problem, and seek to either avoid it (chain and bar design), or to reduce the risk of injury should it occur (chain brakes). In addition to the safety features built into the chainsaw, operators should also wear specific chainsaw safety clothing. Most older saws have few or none of these features, and extra care should be taken in their use. scabbard over the bar and chain  Chain  chain The chain has to be properly matched to the guide bar and the saw. Chainsaw manufacturers specify a selection of suitable chains for each model of saw. Best safety requires that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the depth gauge setting. The depth gauge is the small steel protuberance in front of each cutting tooth. The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the depth gauge determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the depth gauge is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase. Some chains also have guard links in front of each cutter link. The guard link reduces the tendency of the leading edge of the depth gauge to snag on small-diameter objects such as small branches, or to engage with ordinary timber if forced into contact with it.  Chainsaw bars  = Kickback reduction = Kickback is primarily caused by cutting with the chain in the \\"kickback zone\\" on the bar, the upper quarter of the nose. Some saws, usually electric saws intended for domestic garden use, shield this whole area from contact with a \\"tip protector\\". All cutting produces a reaction force on the saw: normally this should be the lower edge of the bar, where the chain is travelling towards the saw and the reaction tends to pull the saw safely towards the log, against the spur dogs. Where the chain is moving downwards, as at the tip of the bar, the same reaction force now acts upwards and will cause a kickback upwards. Tip protectors are metal or plastic devices that fit over the bar tip and are usually fitted to small, domestic-class saws. While these are effective, they hamper the saw in terms of the type and capacity of cuts it can execute, and are not widely used. They find a useful application in pole pruners and one-handed battery-powered saws that are used for trimming, hedge laying etc. The hooked nose of the tip protector can be used to \\"grab\\" branches for cutting, and presents no great drawback since these very small saw units are not used for cuts where the bar tip is buried. = Carving bars = Chainsaw carving often makes deliberate use of plunge cuts, and cuts on the tip of the bar. By simply reducing the diameter of the chain nose, the amount of chain, and thus the force generated during a kickback, may be reduced. Specialist carving bars are available with small pointed noses.  Chain brake  Front handguard, and combined chain brake lever Chain brakes prevent movement of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the driven clutch drum. Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, it can be used to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal. The chain brake is principally operated by the top-hand guard being pushed forward to engage the brake, and pulled back to disengage. The spring-loaded action allows powerful braking under emergency conditions and can halt a chain under full power in a fraction of a second. Correspondingly, it may require considerable force to reset. The chain brake may be activated deliberately by the operator, or automatically by the force of a kickback event. In the former, the operator usually rotates his left wrist and knocks the top hand guard forward with the back of his hand, re-setting it by reaching forward with his fingers to pull the top hand guard backwards. In the case of a kickback event the operator's left hand may be violently dislodged from the handle and the top hand guard will be thrown onto his hand, forcing activation of the chainbrake. Husqvarna models also incorporate a link between the top handle and the chain brake trigger, applying the brake if the saw's bar is forced suddenly upwards. This is known as an \\"inertia\\" chainbrake and will allow activation of the chainbrake even if the operator's left hand is not removed from the handle. The chain brake may also be of use when sharpening a chain on a bar, as it allows robust filing to take place without the chain slipping about. \\"Wrap-around\\" top-hand guards restrict movement and make no allowance for the fact that when the handle is gripped on the lower section of the handle (left side of the saw from the operator's viewpoint) it is usually for making lateral, right-to-left cuts. In this situation the operator's head, neck and shoulders are out of the cutting plane of the saw and will generally not be struck even if a kickback does occur. = Chainsaw kickback = Chainsaw kickback can occur when the tip of the bar comes into contact with a relatively massive or immovable object with the chain under power. The area of the bar tip most likely to be involved is known as the \\"kickback quarter\\". Looking from the side of the bar, the kickback quarter is the 90¬∞ section of bar found between a line going along the centreline of the bar, and another line at 90¬∞ to the first, rising upwards from the centre of the nose sprocket. If this area of chain comes into contact with - for instance - a log, the chain will initially cut the wood, but will also produce a reaction force which pushes the bar upwards. As the bar rises, the chain is forced harder into contact with the wood and climbs upwards even harder. In a fraction of a second the chain may jam hard into the wood and hurl the bar upwards towards the operator, often causing very severe injury or death. The violence of a full kickback event is such that no evasive action is possible, and if the operator's head, neck or shoulders are in line with the plane of the bar, they will certainly be struck by it. At this point, the operator must rely on the chainbrake and protective clothing to save them from injury or worse. Another form of kickback may occur where the top of the bar is used for cutting and becomes suddenly pinched by the wood moving. In this case the saw may be forced backwards towards the operator, or forced into a position where the tip is pinched and the saw transitions into a classic tip-driven kickback. Kickback may also occur as a result of a failed or improperly executed boring cut. Bore cutting is a specialised technique requiring proper training, and should not be attempted without such training. = Kickback reducing systems = By far the most effective tool in preventing kickback is operator training. By preventing contact between the bar tip and solid objects, kickback may be avoided. By keeping their head and body out of the cutting plane of the bar, injury may be prevented if kickback occurs. A useful tip is that if the operator can't read the logo on the side of the bar, they are too close to the cutting plane and should lean left to ensure safety. Correct chain sharpening is paramount to safety in this context. Blunt chain cuts poorly and leads to increased operator fatigue and increased bar loading. Depth gauges filed too low make the chain grab at the wood and may negate the benefits offered by safety chain. Two low kickback chainsaw chains. The upper chain uses the newer bumper drive link design to reduce kickback. The lower chain uses the older bumper tie strap design to reduce kickback. Chain design plays a major part in kickback reduction. Older, non-safety designs carried only teeth and depth gauges. Since these present a solid leading edge at the depth gauge should an object be suddenly forced into the chain, they can easily be made to engage fully with the foreign body and launch into a full kickback. Careful filing of the depth gauges, making a radius down to the leading edge, reduces the risk somewhat. Newer chains with ramped drive links fill in the gap ahead of the depth gauge, reducing the tendency to grab still further. Full safety chains have extra bumper links between the cutting links, maintaining nearly full depth gauge height along the full extent of the chain and reducing the risk of kickback to very low levels. Full safety (bumpered) chains are often fitted as original equipment to domestic and entry level saws. Modern \\"professional\\" chains offer far higher cutting performance than full safety chain, and offset their increased risk with an assumption of a much higher degree of operator competence. In reality they are still safer than traditional chains due to the vastly improved depth gauge design, with a deep ramp ahead of the gauge point. Bar design is another factor in reducing kickback risk. The larger the radius of the bar tip, the greater the risk of kickback as the degree of engagement with the log (or other body) will be greater for a larger tip. Domestic class bars, climbing saw bars and entry- level professional bars usually have very small tips. Professional bars designed for logging and felling may have much larger tips as they are often used for boring cuts to free trapped timber or fell difficult trees, and a tapered, small-tipped bar will wedge easily when boring, stalling the chain. A large-tipped bar with nearly parallel sides bores easily and does not tend to jam. While kickback prevention is a great concern in the context of chainsaw use, it is not the only means by which an operator can be injured by a saw. Local conditions, operator competence and many other factors need to be considered before undertaking sawing operations.  Chain catcher  Chain catcher The chain catcher helps prevent the chain being thrown back towards the user, if the chain breaks or becomes derailed.Stihl, Chain Saw Safety Manual The catcher catches the chain when it derails downwards and shortens it. Then the chain moves underneath the saw body smashing against the rear hand protection at the rear handle (The bottom of the handle is wider to the ba side as to the other). As shown in the image, chain catchers are made of aluminum not to damage the chain. A worn out chain catcher can be changed.  Safety throttle  Safety throttle The engine throttle is operated by the trigger under the rear handle of the saw. Unless the lock-out switch above the rear handle is also pressed, the throttle cannot move from the idle position, and the chain will not be driven. The safety throttle prevents the chain from being driven if the trigger is accidentally pushed by an obstruction, such as a branch in undergrowth. It also prevents throttle activation when hot- starting a saw on the ground with one boot inside the rear handle. The safety throttle is an additional layer of protection in this case, since the chainbrake should be applied before starting a saw in any context. The pictured model has an enlarged lock-out or 'dead man' switch which, when released, also activates the chain brake, thus instantly halting the running chain as well as disengaging the throttle. When needed the lock can be bypassed with a zip tie.  On/Off switch  On/off switch In a gas-powered chainsaw, the on/off switch stops the engine running by preventing the ignition coil from firing. This switch is also called kill switch. It must be clearly marked with the stop position. There must be a positive click action, so that there is no chance that the switch will change position accidentally, even while the saw is vibrating under heavy load. If the switch were to move to the off position while the operator was in the middle of a critical cut while felling a tree, there would at least be a delay, which increases the chance that the tree might fall in an uncontrolled manner. Also, the saw might jam in the cut, requiring that the operator spend extra time under the unsafe tree freeing it. A switch failing \\"on\\" would also present a hazard, since the saw may then start inappropriately, such as when testing compression or assessing starter function. If the operator is injured while using the saw, a bystander might have to move in to turn the saw off. The bystander may be unfamiliar with the saw and needs to be able to identify the on/off switch by its markings. The Stihl model shown combines the choke, throttle start setting and ignition switch into one unified control lever. Other brands of saw usually have separate controls for all three, or a combined throttle start setting and choke control with a separate ignition switch. If the switch fails to operate, a saw may be reliably stopped by operating the choke control to flood the engine.  Centrifugal clutch  Centrifugal clutch The centrifugal clutch disengages the chain from the engine when the engine is only at idling speed, engaging the drive automatically when the throttle is squeezed and the engine is at full speed. The purpose of this clutch is to avoid having a moving chain when the saw is idling and temporarily not cutting. At idle the chain should not move.HSE, Chainsaws at work, p. 7 Many rear-handled chainsaws are used in a state, owing to poor maintenance, where there is some clutch drag and so the chain does move slowly at idle. For top-handled saws though, this is extremely dangerous and the clutch (and chain brake) on such a saw must always be functioning correctly. Some early chainsaws used a manual clutch instead, but this is long obsolete.  Anti-vibration system  rubber bush metal spring Excessive vibration over long periods can cause the user to develop hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), or white finger. This is a potentially permanent and debilitating industrial injury. To reduce vibration, saws are divided into two parts. One part is a rigid assembly of the cutter bar and engine. This part vibrates strongly when the chain is cutting. The other part is a rigid assembly of the handles and controls of the machine, the part the user holds. These two rigid assemblies are joined together by mounts which provide spring suspension and damping. Both metal springs and rubber bushes can be used to provide suspension. Metal springs are more robust and longer wearing, but rubber bushes provide damping in addition to a spring action. Many modern saws incorporate electrically heated handles. This can help prevent HAVS by encouraging circulation to the fingers. Husqvarna models with this option have a \\"G\\" suffix after the model number and Dolmar saws an \\"H\\".  Rear handle  Rear-handled chainsaw and two-handed grip The front and rear handles of a typical \\"rear handle\\" chainsaw are widely spaced,Stihl, Chain Saw Safety Manual pp. 2-3 so as to provide enough leverage for good control,Stihl, Chain Saw Safety Manual pp. 11 and also to provide some degree of control in the event of a kickback.Stihl, Chain Saw Safety Manual pp. 12-16 The operating controls of the chainsaw, such as the throttle and the engine stop (or on/off) switch, are placed so that they may operated whilst retaining a good grip on the rear handle. It is impossible to use a rear-handled chainsaw single-handed. Their balance is such that this is not merely unwise, but so impractical as to be beyond a reasonable chance of it even being attempted. = Top-handled chainsaws = Top-handled chainsaws Top-handled chainsaws are a form of chainsaw whose safety is deliberately compromised in order to permit them being used single-handed where this is essential. They are restricted to working at height, such as up a tree. In all other cases, it should be possible to arrange the cutting task so that it can instead be carried out with two hands and the safer rear-handled chainsaw. In the top- handled saw, the rear handle and its operating controls are moved to the top of the saw. This gives a balance to the saw such that it can now be used one- handed. The front handle remains the same. The chain brake lever is usually separate, rather than being combined into the protective hand guard. In most cases, the top-handled chainsaw is used two-handed.AFAG, Top-handled, ¬ß30,¬ß32 It is only used single-handed when this is essential, such as when one hand is required for climbing.AFAG, Top-handled, ¬ß34 At ground-level, top-handled saws should not be used. Owing to the nature of work at height, and the difficulty of continually restarting the saw, the engine will often still be running when it is not used for cutting at that moment. For this reason it is particularly important that the centrifugal clutch is operating correctly so that the chain doesn't rotate when the engine is idling.AFAG, Top-handled, ¬ß11 The chain brake should also be engaged manually when not actually required,AFAG, Top- handled, ¬ß37 which is why top-handled saws usually have an easy brake control lever. In many jurisdictions, use and even purchase of top-handled chainsaws is restricted to those holding the relevant certificate of competence in their use. However in the United States and New Zealand such saws may be freely purchased and used. = Rear hand guard = The rear hand guard protects the users right hand from being struck by a snapped or derailed chain. It also allows the rear of the saw to be held down by the operator's boot for starting. This is especially useful for cold engines, and larger (70 cc+) saws. Handedness The majority of chainsaws are designed to be used by a right handed person. Using such a chain saw in a left hand way constitutes an additional safety hazard. A left handed person should learn to use it in a right-handed way. There are no manufactured left hand user chainsaws.  Exhaust  Warning sign for mandatory use of spark arresters The exhaust directs the hot and noxious gases coming from the engine away from the user. A faulty exhaust increases noise, decreases engine power, can expose the user to unsafe levels of exhaust gases, and can increase the chance that the user could accidentally touch extremely hot metal. Most models feature a spark screen which is integrated into the muffler. The spark screen prevents sparks from being discharged from the exhaust and potentially igniting sawdust. The spark screen also reduces noise. Hand/Eye/Ear Defender Symbols Warning labels In the EU at least, it is a legal requirement that chainsaws carry certain standardized warning labels which warn of the dangers of kickback as well as making clear the need for protective clothing.  Scabbard  scabbard The cutter chain is sharp enough to cause injury even when it is not being driven. The scabbard covers the chain when the saw is in storage or being transported. It also protects the chain from damage, for instance blunting by contact with concrete floors.

Josef Terboven, Reichskommissar for Norway during the Nazi occupation 1940‚Äì1945, to his left. Photo: National Archives of Norway A founding member of the NSDAP in 1921; after the re-establishment of the party, he rejoined in 1925 and quickly became one of Adolf Hitler's favourites. He was appointed Gauleiter of the Gaus North Rhineland and Ruhr between the years 1925 and 1928, then Gauleiter of Hamburg on 15 April 1929, a post he was to hold until 1945. He was also elected a member of the German Reichstag in November 1932. After Hitler gained power, Kaufmann was appointed Reichsstatthalter (Regional Governor) of Hamburg on 16 May 1933 with absolute power over some 1.8 million people. One of his first acts was to turn over control of the city's Fuhlsb√ºttel Prison to the SA and SS, where it quickly became the nucleus of the notorious Kola-Fu concentration camp. In September 1941, after Allied bombing of Hamburg had rendered many people homeless, Kaufmann petitioned Hitler to allow him to deport local Jews so that he could confiscate their property to rehouse bombed-out citizens. Hitler quickly responded, allowing Kaufmann the dubious distinction of being the first Nazi leader to deport German Jews, in this instance to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto in Poland. A member of the SS since 1933, he was promoted to SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 30 January 1942. On 16 November 1942, he was appointed Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. Adolf Hitler declared Hamburg as fortress, similar to the Festung Warschau, the cities of Pozna≈Ñ, or Kolberg. In April 1945, Kaufmann and Commander Generalmajor Alwin Wolz wanted, independently of each other, to capitulate without further struggle. After negotiations and the publication of a pamphlet prepared by Kaufmann--without Kaufmann's consent--Hamburg was declared an \\"open city\\" by Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, then president of Germany.  After the war  Arrested shortly after the occupation of Hamburg by British forces in 1945, in 1946 Kaufmann was witness at the Nuremberg Trials; he was subsequently tried for war crimes and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, but released soon after on the grounds of ill health after an accident. He was to be arrested twice more before being finally released in 1953. Kaufmann died on 4 December 1969 in Hamburg.  Apologetic account  In his book Das letzte Kapitel (The last chapter) published in 1947, Kurt Detlev M√∂ller described Kaufmann as a \\"good Gauleiter\\", a \\"rebel against the leader\\", and the \\"rescuer of Hamburg\\", because of the capitulation without struggle of the city of Hamburg.

The Proto-Elamite period, also known as Susa III, is the time from ca. 3100 BC to 2700 BC in the area of Elam. In archaeological terms this corresponds to the late Banesh period, and it is recognized as the oldest civilization in Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is an Early Bronze Age writing system briefly in use before the introduction of Elamite cuneiform.  Overview  During the period 8000‚Äì3700 BC, the Fertile Crescent witnessed the spread of small settlements supported by agricultural surplus. Geometric tokens emerged to be used to manage stewardship of this surplus.Salvador Carmona & Mahmoud Ezzamel:Accounting And Forms Of Accountability In Ancient Civilizations: Mesopotamia And Ancient Egypt, IE Business School, IE Working Paper WP05-21, 2005), p.6 The earliest tokens now known are those from two sites in the Zagros region of Iran: Tepe Asiab and Ganj-i-Dareh Tepe.Two precursors of writing: plain and complex tokens The Mesopotamian civilization emerged during the period 3700‚Äì2900 BC amid the development of technological innovations such as the plough, sailing boats and copper metal working. Clay tablets with pictographic characters appeared in this period to record commercial transactions performed by the temples. The most important Proto-Elamite sites are Susa and Anshan. Another important site is Tepe Sialk, where the only remaining Proto-Elamite ziggurat is still seen. Texts in the undeciphered Proto-Elamite script found in Susa are dated to this period. It is thought that the Proto-Elamites were in fact Elamites (Elamite speakers), because of the many cultural similarities (for example, the building of ziggurats), and because no large-scale migration to this area seems to have occurred between the Proto-Elamite period and the later Elamites. But because their script is yet to be deciphered, this theory remains uncertain. Some anthropologists, such as John Alden, maintain that Proto-Elamite influence grew rapidly at the end of the 4th millennium BC and declined equally rapidly with the establishment of maritime trade in the Persian Gulf several centuries later. Proto-Elamite pottery dating back to the last half of the 5th millennium BC has been found in Tepe Sialk, where Proto- Elamite writing, the first form of writing in Iran, has been found on tablets of this date. The first cylinder seals come from the Proto-Elamite period, as well. File:Striding Figure Proto-Elamite period.jpgthumbStriding figure, Proto-Elamite or Mesopotamian (3000-2800 BC).

There is a possibility that the Egyptian script was invented independently from the Mesopotamian script. It is uncertain whether the Proto- Elamite script was the direct predecessor of Linear Elamite. Both scripts remain largely undeciphered, and it is mere speculation to postulate a relationship between the two. A few Proto-Elamite signs seem either to be loans from the slightly older proto-cuneiform (Late Uruk) tablets of Mesopotamia, or perhaps more likely, to share a common origin. Whereas proto- cuneiform is written in visual hierarchies, Proto-Elamite is written in an in- line style: numerical signs follow the objects they count; some non-numerical signs are 'images' of the objects they represent, although the majority are entirely abstract. Economical tablet in Proto-Elamite, Suse III, Louvre Museum, reference Sb 15200, circa 3100-2850 BC. Proto-Elamite tablet with transcription. Proto-Elamite was used for a brief period around 3000 BC (Jemdet Nasr period in Mesopotamia), whereas Linear Elamite is attested for a similarly brief period in the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. Proponents of an Elamo-Dravidian relationship have looked for similarities between the Proto-Elamite script and the Indus script.David McAlpin: \\"Linguistic prehistory: the Dravidian situation\\", in Madhav M. Deshpande and Peter Edwin Hook: Aryan and Non-Aryan in India, p.175-189 =Inscription corpus= The Proto-Elamite writing system was used over a very large geographical area, stretching from Susa in the west, to Tepe Yahya in the east, and perhaps beyond. The known corpus of inscriptions consists of some 1600 tablets, the vast majority unearthed at Susa. Proto-Elamite tablets have been found at the following sites (in order of number of tablets recovered): *Susa (more than 1500 tablets) *Anshan, or Malyan (more than 30 tablets) *Tepe Yahya (27 tablets) *Tepe Sialk (22 tablets) *Jiroft (two tablets) *Ozbaki (one tablet) *Shahr-e Sukhteh (one tablet) None of the inscribed objects from Ghazir, Chogha Mish or Hissar can be verified as Proto-Elamite; the tablets from Ghazir and Choga Mish are Uruk IV style or numerical tablets, whereas the Hissar object cannot be classified at present. The majority of the Tepe Sialk tablets are also not proto-Elamite, strictly speaking, but belong to the period of close contact between Mesopotamia and Iran, presumably corresponding to Uruk V - IV. = Decipherment attempts = Although Proto-Elamite remains undeciphered, the content of many texts is known. This is possible because certain signs, and in particular a majority of the numerical signs, are similar to the neighboring Mesopotamian writing system, proto-cuneiform. In addition, a number of the proto-Elamite signs are actual images of the objects they represent. However, the majority of the proto-Elamite signs are entirely abstract, and their meanings can only be deciphered through careful graphotactical analysis. While the Elamite language has been suggested as a likely candidate underlying the Proto-Elamite inscriptions, there is no positive evidence of this. The earliest Proto-Elamite inscriptions, being purely ideographical, do not in fact contain any linguistic information, and following Friberg's 1978/79 study of Ancient Near Eastern metrology, decipherment attempts have moved away from linguistic methods. In 2012, Dr Jacob Dahl of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford, announced a project to make high-quality images of Proto-Elamite clay tablets and publish them online. His hope is that crowdsourcing by academics and amateurs working together would be able to understand the script, despite the presence of mistakes and the lack of phonetic clues. Dahl assisted in making the images of nearly 1600 Proto-Elamite tablets online.Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative. University of California, Los Angeles. Retrieved 9 March 2015.

They formed in 1978 out of the Star Spangled Washboard Band, a comedy jug band whom the New York Times described as \\"reminiscent of collision between the Earl Scruggs Review and the Three Stooges.\\" Blotto's music combined new wave and soul/R&B;, but with comedic themes. It began as a pick-up band in Saratoga Springs at a club then known as 17 Maple Ave. (later The Metro), with three Washboard Band alumni (who took the stage names Bowtie Blotto, Sergeant Blotto, and Broadway Blotto), plus a drummer and a bassist (Lee Harvey Blotto, and Cheese Blotto). They were joined by Blanche Blotto, who contributed vocals and keyboards and inspired the band's drumhead lady logo. They began to amass a following and played in the New York City area at clubs such as The Ritz, SNAFU, Eighty-Eight, and My Father's Place. DJ Vin Scelsa of WNEW-FM picked up on their initial recording of \\"I Wanna Be A Lifeguard,\\" which soon became the theme song of the Jones Beach Lifeguards. Their songs were played on the Dr. Demento Show, and they appeared on television's Uncle Floyd Show. They toured frequently and were popular primarily in the northeastern United States, especially among college students. After releasing two EPs on their own Blotto Records label, they produced an early music video for \\"I Wanna Be A Lifeguard\\" with video production students at SUNY Albany. The video was played on MTV's very first day on the air in 1981, and continued in frequent rotation. This exposure helped the band produce their album Combo Akimbo, which was released with assistance from Peter Pan Records, as well as a \\"Video 45\\" on VHS from Sony with three videos of Blotto songs that also received wide exposure from airplay on MTV, including \\"Metalhead,\\" with Buck Dharma from Blue √ñyster Cult on lead guitar. Blotto worked with producer Bob Clearmountain on one song on the album. North Lake Sound Chief Engineer, Chris Cassone, produced and engineered the rest of Combo Akimbo. Cassone was also working with Don Roeser (Buck Dharma of BOC) at the time and suggested he hear the homage Blotto had recorded, \\"Metalhead.\\" Because of a one-time mistaken erasure of a guitar track, he was dubbed \\"Eberhard Blotto.\\" The group disbanded in 1984, with the players pursuing more profitable interests. Drummer Lee Harvey Blotto (Paul Rapp) graduated from Albany Law School, became an attorney specializing in intellectual property law, and continued to play with the band as \\"F. Lee Harvey Blotto\\" (a pun on the names of famous lawyer F. Lee Bailey and JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald). Bassist \\"Cheese Blotto\\" (Keith Stephenson) died suddenly in October 1999 of cardiomyopathy brought on by a liver condition. All of Blotto's studio recordings (with one exception, the song \\"Bud ... Is After Us\\") were reissued on a 1994 compact disc compilation, Collected Works. In 1999, the band released Then More Than Ever, a CD comprising previously unreleased live concert recordings, excerpts from a 1982 appearance on the \\"BBC College Concert\\" radio series, and tracks recorded for the never- completed follow-up album to \\"Combo Akimbo.\\" The band in its current incarnation (Broadway, Bowtie, Sergeant, F. Lee Harvey, Clyde and Hammerhead Blotto) is still active, and has reunited for occasional concerts in the Albany area, including an appearance at the 2008 4th of July celebration at Empire State Plaza, and several shows in 2011 at local festivals. On August 6, 2015, the band opened for Blue √ñyster Cult at an \\"Alive at Five\\" concert in Albany. Founding member and lead vocalist Sarge Blotto (real name Greg Haymes) died on April 10th, 2019. In March 2020, Blotto was inducted into the Capital Region Thomas Edison Music Hall of Fame. Members Group members went by pseudonyms on their recordings and in performance.

She was also a maternal great-aunt of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II. A granddaughter of Queen Victoria and an older sister of Alexandra, the last Russian Empress, Elisabeth became famous in Russian society for her beauty and charitable works among the poor. After the Socialist Revolutionary Party's Combat Organization assassinated her husband with a bomb in 1905, Elisabeth publicly forgave Sergei's murderer, Ivan Kalyayev, and campaigned without success for him to be pardoned. She then departed the Imperial Court and became a nun, founding the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent dedicated to helping the downtrodden of Moscow. In 1918 she was arrested and ultimately executed by the Bolsheviks. In 1981 Elisabeth was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate. Princess of Hesse The Hessian grand ducal family in May 1875 Elisabeth was born on 1 November 1864 as the second child of Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Princess Alice, daughter of Queen Victoria. She was given the names Elisabeth Alexandra Luise Alix: \\"Elisabeth\\" after both St. Elizabeth of Hungary (the ancestress of the House of Hesse) and her paternal grandmother, Princess Elisabeth of Prussia, and \\"Luise\\" and \\"Alix\\" after her parents. Elisabeth was known as \\"Ella\\" within her family.Carte de visite of the young princess http://www.jcosmas.com/cdvimages/cdv-26combined.jpg Though she came from one of the oldest and noblest houses in Germany, Elisabeth and her family lived a rather modest life by royal standards. The children swept the floors and cleaned their own rooms, while their mother sewed dresses herself for the children. During the Austro-Prussian War, Princess Alice often took Elisabeth with her while visiting wounded soldiers in a nearby hospital. In this relatively happy and secure environment, Elisabeth grew up surrounded by English domestic habits, and English became her first language. Later in life, she would tell a friend that, within her family, she and her siblings spoke English to their mother and German to their father. In the autumn of 1878, diphtheria swept through the Hesse household, killing Elisabeth's youngest sister, Marie on 16 November, as well as her mother Alice on 14 December. Elisabeth had been sent away to her paternal grandmother's home at the beginning of the outbreak and she was the only member of her family to remain unaffected. When she was finally allowed to return home, she described the meeting as \\"terribly sad\\" and said that everything was \\"like a horrible dream\\". Admirers and suitors Charming and with a very accommodating personality, Elisabeth was considered by many historians and contemporaries to be one of the most beautiful women in Europe at that time. As a young woman, she caught the eye of her elder cousin, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. He was a student then at Bonn University, and on weekends he often visited his Aunt Alice and his Hessian relatives. During these frequent visits, he fell in love with Elisabeth,Packard, Jerrold M, Victoria's Daughters, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1998. p. 176. writing numerous love poems and regularly sending them to her. Wilhelm proposed to Elisabeth in 1878, only for her to reject him. Besides the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, she had many other admirers, among them Lord Charles Montagu, the second son of the 7th Duke of Manchester, and Henry Wilson, later a distinguished soldier. Yet another of Elisabeth's suitors was the future Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden, Wilhelm's first cousin. Queen Victoria described him as \\"so good and steady\\", with \\"such a safe and happy position,\\" that when Elisabeth declined to marry him the Queen \\"deeply regretted it\\". Frederick's grandmother, the Empress Augusta, was so furious at Elisabeth's rejection of Frederick that it took some time for her to forgive Elisabeth. Other admirers included: *Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia (the poet KR), who wrote a poem about her first arrival in Russia and the general impression she made to all the people present at the time. *Prince Felix Yusupov considered her a second mother, and stated in his memoirs that she helped him greatly during the most difficult moments of his life. *As a young girl, Queen Marie of Romania was very fascinated with her Cousin Ella, and would later describe her beauty and sweetness in her memoirs as \\"a thing of dreams\\". *The French Ambassador to the Russian court, Maurice Paleologue, wrote in his memoirs how Elisabeth was capable of arousing what he described as \\"profane passions\\". Ultimately, it was a grand duke of Russia who would win Elisabeth's heart; Elisabeth's great- aunt, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, was a frequent visitor to Hesse. During these visits, she was usually accompanied by her youngest sons, Sergei and Paul. Elisabeth had known them since they were children, and she initially viewed them as haughty and reserved. Sergei, especially, was a very serious young man, intensely religious, and he found himself attracted to Elisabeth after seeing her as a young woman for the first time in several years. At first, Sergei made little impression on Elisabeth. But after the death of both of his parents within a year of each other, Elisabeth sympathised with Sergei because she had felt this same grief after the death of her mother. Their other similarities (both were artistic and religious) drew them closer together. It was said that Sergei was especially attached to Elisabeth because she had the same character as his beloved mother. So when Sergei proposed to her for the second time, she accepted‚Äîmuch to the chagrin of her grandmother Queen Victoria. Grand Duchess of Russia Elisabeth and her husband Sergei Sergei and Elisabeth married on 15 (3) June 1884, at the Chapel of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg; upon her conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, she took the name Elizabetha Feodorovna. It was actually at the wedding that Sergei's 16-year-old nephew, Tsarevich Nicholas, first met his future wife, Elisabeth's youngest surviving sister Alix. Elisabeth was not legally required to convert to Russian Orthodoxy from her native Lutheran religion, but she voluntarily chose to do so in 1891. Although some members of her family questioned her motives, her conversion appears to have been sincere. The new Grand Duchess made a good first impression on her husband's family and the Russian people. \\"Everyone fell in love with her from the moment she came to Russia from her beloved Darmstadt\\", wrote one of Sergei's cousins. The couple settled in the Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace in St. Petersburg; after Sergei was appointed Governor-General of Moscow by his elder brother, Tsar Alexander III, in 1892, they resided in one of the Kremlin palaces. During the summer, they stayed at Ilyinskoe, an estate outside Moscow that Sergei had inherited from his mother. The couple never had children of their own, but their Ilyinskoe estate was usually filled with parties that Elisabeth organized especially for children. They eventually became the foster parents of Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, Sergei's niece and nephew. Elisabeth was somewhat instrumental in the marriage of her nephew-by-marriage, Tsar Nicholas II, to her youngest sister Alix. Much to the dismay of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth had been encouraging Nicholas, then tsarevich, in his pursuit of Alix. When Nicholas did propose to Alix in 1894, and Alix rejected him on the basis of her refusal to convert to Orthodoxy, it was Elisabeth who spoke with Alix and encouraged her to convert. When Nicholas proposed to her again, a few days later, Alix then accepted. Photograph of Ivan Kalyayev taken just after the assassination. I threw the bomb from less than four steps. I was taken by the explosions, I saw the carriage flew to pieces...My overcoat was strewn with splinters of wood all around, it was torn and burnt, there was blood on my face... On 17 February 1905, Sergei was assassinated in the Kremlin by the Socialist-Revolutionary, Ivan Kalyayev. The event came as a terrible shock to Elisabeth, but she never lost her calm. It was as if her prophecy had come true that \\"God will punish us severely\\" which she made after the Grand Duke expelled 20,000 Jews from Moscow, by simply surrounding thousands of families' houses with soldiers and expelling the Jews without any notice overnight out of their homes and the city. Her niece Marie later recalled that her aunt's face was \\"pale and stricken rigid\\" and she would never forget her expression of infinite sadness. In her rooms, said Marie, Elisabeth \\"let herself fall weakly into an armchair...her eyes dry and with the same peculiar fixity of gaze, she looked straight into space, and said nothing.\\" As visitors came and went, she looked without ever seeming to see them. Throughout the day of her husband's murder, Elisabeth refused to cry. But Marie recalled how her aunt slowly abandoned her rigid self-control, finally breaking down into sobs. Many of her family and friends feared that she would suffer a nervous breakdown, but she quickly recovered her equanimity. According to Edvard Radzinsky, > Elizabeth spent all the days before the burial in ceaseless prayer. On her > husband's tombstone she wrote: 'Father, release them, they know not what > they do.' She understood the words of the Gospels heart and soul, and on the > eve of the funeral she demanded to be taken to the prison where Kalyayev was > being held.

'Do not listen to your pride. Repent... and > I will beg the Sovereign to give you your life. I will ask him for you. I > myself have already forgiven you.' On the eve of revolution, she had already > found a way out; forgiveness! Forgive through the impossible pain and blood > -- and thereby stop it then, at the beginning, this bloody wheel. By her > example, poor Ella appealed to society, calling upon the people to live in > Christian faith. 'No!\\" replied Kalyayev. 'I do not repent. I must die for my > deed and I will... My death will be more useful to my cause than Sergei > Alexandrovich's death.' Kalyayev was sentenced to death. 'I am pleased with > your sentence,' he told the judges. 'I hope that you will carry it out just > as openly and publicly as I carried out the sentence of the Socialist > Revolutionary Party. Learn to look the advancing revolution right in the > face.'Edvard Radzinsky, The Last Tsar, page 82. Kalyayev was hanged on 23 May 1905. In 1915 the All-Russian Zemstvo Union was organised under her auspices to provide support for sick and injured soldiers during the First World War. Religious life Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna as a nun after her husband's death After Sergei's death, Elisabeth wore mourning clothes and became a vegetarian. In 1909, she sold off her magnificent collection of jewels and sold her other luxurious possessions; even her wedding ring was not spared. With the proceeds she opened the Convent of Saints Martha and Mary and became its abbess. She soon opened a hospital, a chapel, a pharmacy and an orphanage on its grounds. Elisabeth and her nuns worked tirelessly among the poor and the sick of Moscow. She often visited Moscow's worst slums and did all she could to help alleviate the suffering of the poor. For many years, Elisabeth's institution helped the poor and the orphans in Moscow by fostering the prayer and charity of devout women. In 1916, Elisabeth had what was to be her final meeting with her sister Alexandra, the tsarina, at Tsarskoye Selo. While the meeting took place in private, the tutor to the tsar's children apparently recalled that the discussion included Elisabeth expressing her concerns over the influence that Grigori Rasputin had over Alexandra and the imperial court, and begging her to heed the warnings of both herself and other members of the imperial family. In 2010 a historian claimed that Elisabeth may have been aware that the murder of Rasputin was to take place and secondly, she knew who was going to commit that particular murder when she wrote a letter and sent it to the Tsar and two telegrams to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Zinaida Yusupova, her friend. The telegrams, which were written the night of the murder, reveal that the Grand Duchess was aware of who the murderers were before that information had been released to the public, and she stated that she felt that the killing was a \\"patriotic act.\\"M. Nelipa (2010) The Murder of Grigorii Rasputin. A Conspiracy That Brought Down the Russian Empire, p. 269-271. Death In 1918, Vladimir Lenin ordered the Cheka to arrest Elisabeth. They then exiled her first to Perm, then to Yekaterinburg, where she spent a few days and was joined by others: the Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich; Princes Ioann Konstantinovich, Konstantin Konstantinovich, Igor Konstantinovich and Vladimir Pavlovich Paley; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and Varvara Yakovleva, a sister from the Grand Duchess's convent. They were all taken to Alapayevsk on 20 May 1918, where they were housed in the Napolnaya School on the outskirts of the town. Mine shaft in Siniachikha where Elisabeth and her family were murdered At noon on 17 July, Cheka officer Pyotr Startsev and a few Bolshevik workers came to the school. They took from the prisoners whatever money they had left and announced that they would be transferred that night to the Upper Siniachikhensky factory compound. The Red Army guards were told to leave and Cheka men replaced them. That night the prisoners were awakened and driven in carts on a road leading to the village of Siniachikha, some from Alapayevsk where there was an abandoned iron mine with a pit deep. Here they halted. The Cheka beat all the prisoners before throwing their victims into this pit, Elisabeth being the first. Hand grenades were then hurled down the shaft, but only one victim, Fyodor Remez, died as a result of the grenades. According to the personal account of Vasily Ryabov, one of the killers, Elisabeth and the others survived the initial fall into the mine, prompting Ryabov to toss in a grenade after them. Following the explosion, he claimed to have heard Elisabeth and the others singing an Orthodox hymn from the bottom of the shaft. Unnerved, Ryabov threw down a second grenade, but the singing continued. Finally a large quantity of brushwood was shoved into the opening and set alight, upon which Ryabov posted a guard over the site and departed. Early on 18 July 1918, the leader of the Alapayevsk Cheka, Abramov, and the head of the Yekaterinburg Regional Soviet, Beloborodov, who had been involved in the execution of the Imperial Family, exchanged a number of telegrams in a pre-arranged plan saying that the school had been attacked by an \\"unidentified gang\\". A month later, Alapayevsk fell to the White Army of Admiral Alexander Kolchak. Lenin welcomed Elisabeth's death, remarking that \\"virtue with the crown on it is a greater enemy to the world revolution than a hundred tyrant tsars\\".The French Revolution and the Russian Anti-Democratic Tradition: A Case of False Consciousness (1997). Dmitry Shlapentokh. Transaction Publishers. . p. 266The Speckled Domes (1925). Gerard Shelley. p. 220 Legacy =Fate of the remains= On 8 October 1918, White Army soldiers discovered the remains of Elisabeth and her companions, still within the shaft where they had been murdered. Despite having lain there for almost three months, the bodies were in relatively good condition. Most were thought to have died slowly from injuries or starvation, rather than the subsequent fire. Elisabeth had died of wounds sustained in her fall into the mine, but before her death had still found strength to bandage the head of the dying Prince Ioann with her wimple. With the Red Army approaching, their remains were removed further east and buried in the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Mission in Peking (now Beijing), China. In 1921, the bodies of Elisabeth and of Sister Barbara (Varvara Yakovleva), one of her nuns, were taken to Jerusalem, where they were laid to rest in the Church of Mary Magdalene at Gethsemane. The Russian Orthodox Mission in Beijing was demolished in 1957 and its cemetery paved over as a parking lot in 1986. =Canonisation= Elisabeth was canonised by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in 1981, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate as Holy Martyr Elizabeth Feodorovna. Her principal shrines are the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent she founded in Moscow, and the Saint Mary Magdalene Convent on the Mount of Olives, which she and her husband helped build, and where her relics (along with those of Nun Barbara (Varvara Yakovleva, her former maid) are enshrined. Tomb and mosaic icon of Princess Elizabeth =Commemoration= She is one of the ten 20th-century martyrs from across the world who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey, London, England,Burials and memorials in Westminster Abbey#20th Century Martyrs and she is also represented in the restored nave screen installed at St Albans Cathedral in April 2015. A statue of Elisabeth was erected in the garden of her convent in Moscow after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Its inscription reads: \\"To the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna: With Repentance.\\" Rehabilitation On 8 June 2009, the Prosecutor General of Russia officially posthumously rehabilitated Elizabeth Feodorovna, along with other Romanovs: Mikhail Alexandrovich, Sergei Mikhailovich, Ioann Konstantinovich, Konstantin Konstantinovich and Igor Konstantinovich. \\"All of these people were subjected to repression in the form of arrest, deportation and being held by the Cheka without charge,\\" said a representative of the office.

The company had 6 theatres at its peak. It is now owned by Cineplex Entertainment. History In July 2005, following Cineplex's acquisition of main rival Famous Players Theatres, the group was put up for sale. In 2005, the Fifth Avenue Cinemas and Park Theatre Cinemas locations in Vancouver were sold to Festival Cinemas, which has since been sold to Cineplex Entertainment on March 1, 2013. Around 2006, the University 4 Cinemas location in Victoria was sold to Empire Theatres, which was later sold to Landmark Cinemas on October 31, 2013. Landmark Cinemas currently operates the theatre. In 2007, The Bayview Village Cinemas location in Toronto shut down, potentially due to a failure to reach a lease agreement. The Cumberland 4 Cinemas location in Yorkville, Toronto was shutdown in May 2012. This left the company with only the Beaches Cinemas location left.

Early years and education Harding was born in Haywards Heath, Sussex, the son of Paul Harding, an insurance executive. He attended Abingdon School in Abingdon-on-Thames from 1964 until 1971. He was a member of the badminton first team, for which he was awarded half-colours, in addition to being a cricket first XI player, captain of the colts cricket team and a member of the hockey second XI. Although he enjoyed the sport, he did not enjoy the school ethos, earning a single 'A' Level in Latin. In June 1995, he was appointed a \\"Steward‚Äù of Abingdon School and presented the awards at ‚ÄúLeavers‚Äô Day‚Äù. He also donated ¬£500,000 towards the school‚Äôs ‚ÄúMercers Court‚Äù, a new IT centre where one of the rooms was named ‚ÄùThe Matthew Harding Careers Room‚Äù in his honour after his particular interest in offering career‚Äôs advice to the students. He returned to the school just weeks before his death to speak to a small group of sixth formers about his road to success. Career He left school and went to London. Through his father's friendship with Ted Benfield, he joined the insurance brokers Benfield, Lovick & Rees and it was in the insurance industry that he made his fortune, starting out by making the tea and going on to be a director. By 1980, he had acquired a 32% stake in the company, becoming one of Britain's 100 richest men. Chelsea FC Stamford Bridge in 2014, in tribute to Harding. It reads \\"Matthew Harding's Blue & White Army\\" A lifelong fan of Chelsea Football Club, Harding responded to Chelsea chairman Ken Bates' call for new investment in the club in 1993. In October 1993, he was appointed as a Chelsea Football Club director. He invested ¬£26.5 million in the club, including ¬£7.5m towards construction of the \\"Matthew Harding Stand\\", ¬£16.5m to buy the Stamford Bridge freehold and transfer funds. Death and legacy Harding died at the age of 42 in a helicopter accident in October 1996, while flying back from a Chelsea match at Bolton Wanderers, along with the pilot and three passengers, including journalist John Bauldie. The crash of the Eurocopter AS355 √âcureuil 2 aircraft took place at night and in poor weather, near Middlewich, Cheshire. An investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that the pilot did not have the experience or qualifications necessary to safely pilot by instruments in such conditions.

These observatories, including the first successful space telescope, provided the first high-quality observations of many objects in ultraviolet light. Although two OAO missions were failures, the success of the other two increased awareness within the astronomical community of the benefits of space-based observations, and led to the instigation of the Hubble Space Telescope. OAO-1 The first OAO was launched successfully on 8 April 1966, carrying instruments to detect ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray emission. Before the instruments could be activated, a power failure resulted in the termination of the mission after three days. The spacecraft was out of control, so that the solar panels could not be deployed to recharge the batteries that would supply power to the electrical and electronic equipment on board. OAO-2 OAO-2 was launched on 7 December 1968, and carried 11 ultraviolet telescopes. It observed successfully until January 1973, and contributed to many significant astronomical discoveries. Among these were the discovery that comets are surrounded by enormous haloes of hydrogen, several hundred thousand kilometres across, and observations of novae which found that their UV brightness often increased during the decline in their optical brightness. OAO-B OAO-B carried a ultraviolet telescope, and should have provided spectra of fainter objects than had previously been observable. The satellite was launched on 30 November 1970 with \\"the largest space telescope ever launched\\",\\"U.S. Fails to Orbit Large Telescope\\", The New York Times, December 1, 1970, pA23 but never made it into orbit. The payload fairing did not separate properly during ascent and the excess weight of it prevented the Centaur stage from achieving orbital velocity. The Centaur and OAO reentered the atmosphere and broke up, destroying a $98,500,000 project. The disaster was later traced to a flaw in a $100 explosive bolt that failed to fire.\\"A Faulty Bolt Is Blamed For Failure of Satellite\\", The New York Times, January 13, 1971, pA43 OAO-3 (Copernicus) A flight spare of the grazing incidence mirror built for OAO-3 (Copernicus). The mirror was part of the X-ray telescope built by University College London. It is now held in the collections of the Science Museum, London. OAO-3 was launched on 21 August 1972, and proved to be the most successful of the OAO missions. It was a collaborative effort between NASA and the UK's Science Research Council (currently known as the Science and Engineering Research Council), and carried an X-ray detector built by University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in addition to an 80 cm UV telescope built by Princeton University. After its launch, it was named Copernicus to mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus operated until February 1981, and returned high resolution spectra of hundreds of stars along with extensive X-ray observations. Among the significant discoveries made by Copernicus were the discovery of several long-period pulsars, with rotation times of many minutes instead of the more typical second or less.

It is located at the crossroads of Dalston Lane, Kingsland Road and Balls Pond Road. The station served by London Overground East London line and is in Zone 2.http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.pdf The station is located in a short section of cut and cover tunnel north of the Kingsland Viaduct. History =Original station= The station was first opened on 1 November 1865 by the North London Railway on its \\"City Extension\\" from the North London line to Broad Street in the City of London. It had three island platforms with four through lines joining the west side of the North London line, and two joining the east. The station had no overall roof. The line to Broad Street and the station closed after the last trains ran on 27 June 1986. However, the location at the corner of Kingsland High Street and Dalston Lane retained the name Dalston Junction on road and bus signs throughout the period that the station was closed. =Re-opened station= New platforms Rebuilding the station for the London Overground network began with site clearance in early 2005. The station was opened by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on 27 April 2010. A limited weekday \\"preview\\" service started that day with the first train leaving Dalston Junction at 12.05. The service was of eight trains per hour between Dalston Junction and station from 07:00 to 20:00; four of the eight trains continued to and four to . The full service to West Croydon with branches to and began on 23 May 2010, at hours similar to those of the London Underground. The service interval to each of the three southern terminals is approximately fifteen minutes for most of the day, though greater early mornings, late evenings, and parts of Sundays. The South London line was open to the public on 9 December 2012 and officially launched the next day by the Mayor, with the station now serving as the northern terminus to and trains. (via ) and trains now start from Highbury & Islington. In the first phase of the extension of the East London Line, Dalston Junction was the temporary northern terminus for all trains. From 28 February 2011 to 9 December 2012, trains from West Croydon and Crystal Palace continued beyond Dalston Junction, taking the relaid west curve north of the station to . As stated above, Dalston Junction still remains a terminal for trains, using the two bay platforms in the middle of the station. Transport for London and Hackney London Borough Council are currently developing the extensive station site with a bus interchange and high-rise towers above the new station. On 6 December 2012, The Co-operative Food opened a branch, located left of the station's main entrance. The new station has two platform islands, the outer sides of each providing through services, the inner bay faces supporting terminating services. Although the route eastward at the north end of the station has been protected it would require substantial reconstruction first. The entire station is underneath a new building development. Station layout Track layout from south The western of the two chords north of the station was reinstated on 28 February 2011 for East London Line services to . There are no plans to rebuild the eastern chord but its alignment has been safeguarded. The eastern chord was used by Broad Street services to Poplar until 1944 and freight services until 1965.Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley The City Extension to the south was mainly four-track but now has only two. The wide site at Dalston Junction has in the past had six platforms. Services =London Overground= Rail services are provided by London Overground.

CMBS tend to be more complex and volatile than residential mortgage-backed securities due to the unique nature of the underlying property assets.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 4 (Thomson West, 2017 ed.). CMBS issues are usually structured as multiple tranches, similar to collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), rather than typical residential \\"passthroughs.\\" The typical structure for the securitization of commercial real estate loans is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), a creation of the tax law that allows the trust to be a pass-through entity which is not subject to tax at the trust level. Many American CMBS transactions carry less prepayment risk than other MBS types, thanks to the structure of commercial mortgages. Commercial mortgages often contain lockout provisions (typically a period of 1-5 years where there can be no prepayment of the loan) which they can be subject to defeasance, yield maintenance and prepayment penalties to protect bondholders. European CMBS issues typically have less prepayment protection. Interest on the bonds may be a fixed rate or a floating rate, i.e. based on a benchmark (like LIBOR/EURIBOR) plus a spread. Organization The following is a descriptive passage from the \\"Borrower Guide to CMBS\\" published by the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association and the Mortgage Banker's Association: Commercial real estate first mortgage debt is generally broken down into two basic categories: (1) loans to be securitized (\\"CMBS loans\\") and (2) portfolio loans. Portfolio loans are originated by a lender and held on its balance sheet through maturity. In a CMBS transaction, many single mortgage loans of varying size, property type and location are pooled and transferred to a trust. The trust issues a series of bonds that may vary in yield, duration and payment priority. Nationally recognized rating agencies then assign credit ratings to the various bond classes ranging from investment grade (AAA/Aaa through BBB-/Baa3) to below investment grade (BB+/Ba1 through B-/B3) and an unrated class which is subordinate to the lowest rated bond class. Investors choose which CMBS bonds to purchase based on the level of credit risk/yield/duration that they seek. Each month the interest received from all of the pooled loans is paid to the investors, starting with those investors holding the highest rated bonds, until all accrued interest on those bonds is paid. Then interest is paid to the holders of the next highest rated bonds and so on. The same thing occurs with principal as payments are received. This sequential payment structure is generally referred to as the \\"waterfall\\". If there is a shortfall in contractual loan payments from the Borrowers or if loan collateral is liquidated and does not generate sufficient proceeds to meet payments on all bond classes, the investors in the most subordinate bond class will incur a loss with further losses impacting more senior classes in reverse order of priority. The typical structure for the securitization of commercial real estate loans is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). A REMIC is a creation of the tax law that allows the trust to be a pass-through entity which is not subject to tax at the trust level. The CMBS transaction is structured and priced based on the assumption that it will not be subject to tax with respect to its activities; therefore, compliance with REMIC regulations is essential. CMBS has become an attractive capital source for commercial mortgage lending because the bonds backed by a pool of loans are generally worth more than the sum of the value of the whole loans. The enhanced liquidity and structure of CMBS attracts a broader range of investors to the commercial mortgage market. This value creation effect allows loans intended for securitization to be aggressively priced, benefiting Borrowers. Industry participants =Primary servicer (or sub-servicer)= (Also see primary servicer) In some cases the borrower may deal with a primary servicer that may also be the loan originator or mortgage banker who sourced the loan. The primary servicer maintains the direct borrower contact, and the master servicer may sub-contract certain loan administration duties to the primary or sub-servicer. =Master servicer= The master servicer‚Äôs responsibility is to service the loans in the pool through to maturity unless the borrower defaults. The master servicer manages the flow of payments and information and is responsible for the ongoing interaction with the performing borrower. =Special servicer= (Also see special servicer) Upon the occurrence of certain specified events, primarily a default, the administration of the loan is transferred to the special servicer. Besides handling defaulted loans, the special servicer also has approval authority over material servicing actions, such as loan assumptions. =Directing certificateholder / controlling class / B-piece buyer= The most subordinate bond class outstanding at any given point is considered to be the directing certificateholder, also referred to as the controlling class. The investor in the most subordinate bond classes is commonly referred to as the \\"B-piece buyer\\". B-piece buyers generally purchase the B-rated and BB/Ba-rated bond classes along with the unrated class. =Trustee= The trustee‚Äôs primary role is to hold all the loan documents and distribute payments received from the master servicer to the bondholders. Although the trustee is typically given broad authority with respect to certain aspects of the loan under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA), the trustee typically delegates its authority to either the special servicer or the master servicer. =Rating agency= There will be as few as one and as many as four rating agencies involved in rating a securitization. Rating agencies establish bond ratings for each bond class at the time the securitization is closed. They also monitor the pool‚Äôs performance and update ratings for investors based on performance, delinquency and potential loss events affecting the loans within the trust.

Character Sir Toby is an ambiguous mix of high spirits and low cunning. He first appears in the play's third scene, when he storms onto the stage the morning after a hard night out, complaining about the sombre melancholy that hangs over his niece's household. \\"What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I'm sure care's an enemy to life.\\" This immediately establishes Sir Toby at the opposite pole from the languishing melancholy which dominated the first scene (including Orsino's speech, \\"If music be the food of love...\\"), identifying him as a force for vitality, noise and good cheer, as his name suggests. At the beginning Sir Toby appears to be friends with another character, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, a guest of Olivia, Sir Toby's niece. However as the play progresses, it transpires that Sir Toby is just taking advantage of Sir Andrew's riches. His tormenting of the steward Malvolio is similarly double-edged in its tone of \\"sportful malice\\" (V,1). The plot against Malvolio is generally considered a comic highlight of the play, but critics have often complained of its cruelty.See the discussion in William Shakespeare, Twelfth Night, or What you Will, ed. by Keir Elam (London: Arden, 2008), pp. 8‚Äì9. The play ends with the quarrel still unresolved, and Olivia warning that Malvolio \\"hath been most notoriously abused\\" (V,1). Though he taunts Malvolio with the demand \\"Art any more than a steward?\\" (II,3), he only does so after Malvolio has threatened him with being turned out if he doesn't reform his ways. Indeed part of Malvolio's complaint is that Sir Toby and his companions are not acting like noblemen by drinking and singing, but like \\"tinkers\\" in an \\"alehouse\\". His appreciation of Maria, though couched in terms that might not please every woman: \\"She's a beagle, true-bred\\" (II,3), and eventual marriage, shows that he thinks his title of no particular account compared to his love for her.

The presently visible castle was probably built in the 1260s by Gruffydd Maelor II, a prince of Powys Fadog, on the site of several earlier structures, including an Iron Age hillfort. Dinas Br√¢n has been variously translated as the \\"crow's fortress\\" or \\"fortress of Br√¢n\\", with Br√¢n as the name of an individual or of a nearby stream. An English name, \\"Crow Castle\\", has also been used since at least the 18th century. Toponym Looking westwards from Dinas Br√¢n towards the Eglwyseg. The name Dinas Br√¢n has been debated since at least the 17th century. In modern times it is sometimes incorrectly translated as the City of Crows: the word dinas, \\"city\\" in modern Welsh, in Middle Welsh signifies a defended enclosure, while br√¢n is the Welsh for \\"crow\\", singular, (plural: brain), suggesting a meaning \\"the crow's fortress\\". An alternative theory is that Br√¢n is a personal name. Humphrey Llwyd and William Camden both suggested it came from that of a Gaulish chieftain, \\"Brennus\\". There is a legend which says that Br√¢n was a Cornish prince, the son of the Duke of Cornwall, while another suggests Br√¢n could be named for King Br√¢n Fendigaid (the Blessed) also called Bendigeidfran, a Celtic God who appears in both Welsh and Irish mythology. Camden also suggested the name was simply derived from the word bryn, \\"hill\\". A further suggestion is that Br√¢n simply refers to a mountain stream of the same name which originated in the Eglwyseg Rocks and ran at the northern foot of the hill, a suggestion made by Thomas Pennant amongst others. The 17th century scholar Edward Lhuyd, in Adversaria, confirmed that to his knowledge the name Br√¢n came from \\"the brook of this name by Lhangollen\\". As with several other streams in Wales, the word Br√¢n was applied to the brook apparently due to the black colour of its water. The castle is known in English as \\"Crow Castle\\". This form of the name has been used since at least the 18th century, having been recorded in Gough's edition of William Camden's Britannia. By the mid 19th century this was the form of the name said to be used by most of the inhabitants of Llangollen, where there was an inn of the same name. History =Iron age = A large hillfort was built on the hill around 600BCE during the British Iron Age. An earthen rampart - probably with a wooden palisade - surrounded a number of roundhouses. An extra deep ditch was cut to defend the gentler slopes on the southern side of the hill. This was one of many hillforts in this part of North Wales; for example Moel y Gaer near the Horseshoe Pass, Y Gardden in Ruabon, and on Foel Fenlli and Moel Arthur in the Clwydian Hills. =Post Roman Britain= The earliest structure that might have been built at Dinas Br√¢n is believed to have belonged to Elisedd ap Gwylog during the 8th century. Elisedd, who was a Romano British ruler during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is named on the Pillar of Eliseg and is considered one of the founders of the Kingdom of Powys, however, no archaeological evidence for any structure from this period has been found. =Late Medieval period= The inner bailey at Dinas Br√¢n Dinas Br√¢n may have been a fortification in the Kingdom of Powys. When its last Prince, Gruffydd Maelor, died in 1191, his kingdom was divided into Powys Fadog in the north and Powys Wenwynwyn in the south. His son, Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor, the lord of Powys Fadog, who founded Valle Crucis Abbey at Llantysilio in 1201 might have ruled from Dinas Br√¢n. Whatever structure existed at this site, it would have been a wooden fortification probably consisting of a wooden palisade surrounding a hall and other buildings. Early records attest to this early castle being destroyed by fire. Following the destruction of the wooden castle, Gruffydd II ap Madog, Lord of Dinas Bran, the son of Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor, rebuilt Dinas Br√¢n in stone sometime in the 1260s. At the time Gruffydd II ap Madog was an ally of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd Prince of Wales, with Powys acting as a buffer state between Llywelyn's heartland of Gwynedd and England. Dinas Br√¢n was one of several castles being built following the signing of the Treaty of Montgomery which had secured Wales for Llywelyn, free from English interference. The castle at Dolforwyn Castle near Newtown, which was ordered to be built by Llywelyn around the same time, has some similarities to Dinas Br√¢n and may have been the work of the same master mason. When Gruffudd died in 1269 or 1270, the castle was inherited by his four sons. Madoc the eldest son was senior but each of the sons may have had apartments at Dinas Br√¢n. The peace between Llywelyn and Edward I did not last long. In 1277 Edward launched the Conquest of North Wales from Chester. Two of Gruffudd's sons, Llywelyn and Madoc, quickly made peace with Edward. However, their surrender documents state the need to recapture Dinas Br√¢n proving that the fortification was not under Madoc's control. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln was sent with forces from Oswestry to capture Dinas Br√¢n. As soon as he had arrived he was told that the defenders of the castle, probably the younger brothers Owain and Gruffudd - who were still allies of Llywelyn Prince of Wales, had abandoned the castle and set it alight. The reason for this action is not clear but it may be that they had no confidence that they could defend the castle so did not want to let it fall intact to the English or their elder brother. Despite the fire, the castle was not badly damaged. The Earl Lincoln recommended to Edward that the castle be repaired and garrisoned. The castle was occupied by the English till at least the Treaty of Aberconwy when Llywelyn sued for peace and ordered some repair work was undertaken. When the war restarted in 1282, the history of the castle is not recorded. It may have been recaptured by the Welsh like many other castles in the early months of the war, but ultimately it fell to the English. After Madoc died: the three surviving brothers all fought for Llewelyn. Following the end of the war in October 1282 and the death of Llywelyn, most of Powys Fadog including the castle was granted to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Rather than rebuild Dinas Br√¢n, De Warenne choose instead to build a new castle by the River Dee at Holt on the Flintshire-Cheshire border. Dinas Br√¢n was left to fall into ruin. Layout Dinas Br√¢n southern wall and deep rock cut ditch Dinas Br√¢n has rectangular stone defensive walls with the longer sides running in an east-west direction. The northern wall is defended with the steep natural slope that falls sharply downards for several hundred feet. The walls on the gentler slopes on the southern and eastern sides are strengthened with an additional deep rock-cut ditch and counterscarp bank. At the south-eastern corner where the ditch is at its deepest stood the keep, which looks out onto a relatively easy approach to the castle from the River Dee. The two-storey structure00 would have been the strongest part of the castle, with its own defended approach through a narrow passage. Adjacent to the keep at the north eastern corner is a gatehouse, which was originally approached by a wooden bridge spanning the ditch. There is however almost no evidence remaining of the bridge and its supporting structure so that the exact configuration remains unclear. The bridge was also overlooked by the keep which allowed archers stationed there to guard the entrance. The Gatehouse had two towers either side of a decorated covered passageway into the castle courtyard. The Great Hall is sited on the castle's southern side, where some of the more visible remains still stand. This was a large room used for dining and receiving visitors. Its much enlarged windows still look south across the valley and an arched gateway leads from the west end of the room to what was once the Kitchens in the basement of the adjacent apsidal ('D' shaped) tower. This tower, called the Welsh Tower, is a typical feature of Welsh castles of the period. It would have protruded from the castle wall into the defensive ditch and provided archers with a clear view of any attackers attempting to approach the southern wall. The tower had perhaps three storeys with living quarters on the upper floors. In the south western corner was a Postern gate. This was an additional exit from the castle, designed to be used in times of siege to allow the garrison to 'sally' out and attack their besiegers. Fragments of the arch remain as well as the slot for the door's drawbar. Originally, in the enclosed area of the castle there would have been stables, workshops, storage buildings and maybe a chapel but as these were built of wood nothing remains above ground level. In the 19th century there was a local tradition, recorded by Walter Hawken Tregellas, that at Tower Farm, about a mile from the castle, had formerly stood a tower that was an outwork of the castle defences. Legends and literature Castell Dinas Br√¢n viewed from the north west Whilst the historical record for Dinas Br√¢n is sparse, there are many myths and legends associated with the ancient site. The popular Welsh song 'Myfanwy' was composed by Joseph Parry and first published in 1875. Parry wrote the music to lyrics written by Richard Davies ('Mynyddog'; 1833‚Äì77). The lyrics were probably inspired by the fourteenth-century love-story of Myfanwy Fychan of Castell Dinas Br√¢n, and the poet Hywel ab Einion. That story was also the subject of the popular poem, 'Myfanwy Fychan' (1858), by John Ceiriog Hughes (1832‚Äì87) and of Felicia Hemans's poem 'Howel's Song', set to music by John Parry in his 'Welsh Melodies' (1822). The castle first literary appearance is in a 12th-century historical document entitled \\"Fouke le Fitz Waryn,\\" or \\"The Romance of Fulk Fitzwarine.\\" In this tale the castle, named \\"Chastiel Bran,\\" is referred to as a ruin during the early years of the Norman Conquest. The tale continues to tell of an arrogant Norman knight, Payn Peveril, who hears that no one has had courage enough to stay overnight inside the castle ruins, for fear of evil spirits. Payn and 15 'knightly followers' determine to stay the night. A storm blows up and an evil, mace-wielding giant called Gogmagog, appears. Payn defends his men against the attacks of the giant with his shield and cross, then stabs Gogmagog with his sword. As the giant is dying he tells of the earlier bravery of King Br√¢n who had built the castle to try to defeat the giant. Despite King Br√¢n's attempts against Gogmagog the King had been forced to flee and since then the giant had terrorised all the land around for many years. The giant also tells of a great treasury of idols buried at Dinas Br√¢n which includes swans, peacocks, horses and a huge golden ox but dies without revealing its location. Preservation Recent archaeological research at Castell Dinas Br√¢n The castle is a scheduled ancient monument owned and maintained by Denbighshire council with the assistance of Cadw. It is open all year round for visitors. Due to the exposed steep routes up to the castle, official advice suggests stout walking shoes and warm, waterproof clothing.

Construction of the tower began in 1898 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's discovery of Newfoundland, and Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. In 1901, Guglielmo Marconi received the first trans-Atlantic wireless message at a position near the tower, the letter \\"S\\" in Morse Code sent from Poldhu, Cornwall, United Kingdom. Cabot Tower is now the centre of the Signal Hill National Historic Site of Canada, with walking trails and an interpretation centre. History Begun in 1898, to commemorate both Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and the 400th anniversary of John Cabot's (Giovanni Caboto) voyage to the New World, Cabot Tower was completed in 1900 and has been a part of a number of historic events. Although now one of the most recognizable symbols of St. John's and Newfoundland and Labrador, its construction was not well supported in the town. Most of St. John's burned to the ground in 1892 and the banks in Newfoundland crashed in 1894. When Judge D.W. Prowse, a prominent local man, suggested building Cabot Tower, one person said in a local paper that \\"it's like putting a silk hat on the head of a man who can't afford to buy a pair of boots.\\" Another project, the Victoria Wing of the local hospital, received much more public support. Cabot Tower postage stamp The building was used primarily for flag signalling. The British military first used Signal Hill, originally known as the Lookout, for this purpose in around 1704. There was a mast at the highest point on the hill, and it would be the job of a signalman to keep an eye out for ships approaching the city. When one was spotted he would indicate by flag what type of ship it was, what country it was from and fire off a peterra so that the men below in the town would know to look towards the hill. Then they would fire the same type of cannon in response. By the end of the 18th century, a blockhouse had been constructed on the site. By the 19th century, the signalling was done mostly for the various merchants who operated out of St. John's. Cabot Tower was the last in a line of signalling blockhouses built on Signal Hill. It was used for flag signalling until 1958. Signal Hill and Cabot Tower, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada In 1933, a Marconi station, which operated until 1960, was opened on the second floor of Cabot Tower. In 1920, one of the first wireless transatlantic transmissions of the human voice was made there. Men at the wireless station were able to talk with the steamship Victoria which was steaming out of England. Today, the Society of Newfoundland Radio Amateurs operates a ham radio there. Architectural value View from south Located at the highest point of Signal Hill, overlooking the city and the ocean, Cabot Tower is an example of late-Gothic Revival style. Built of irregularly coursed red sandstone, it is composed of a two-story, 30 foot, square structure with a three-story, 50 foot octagonal tower that stands on the southeast corner of the building. The corners are buttressed at the first floor level and further emphasized through the use of heavier blocks of stone. On the main body of the building, at the top of the second storey level, is a line of repeating pattern like an exaggerated dentil row or inverted crenelations. The attached tower, which houses the main entrance, is very plain with a double string course marking the divisions between second and third storeys and heavy corbel tables marking the eight corners of the turret at the flared upper level. The windows on both the corner turret and the body of the tower proper are rectangular and set under heavy stone lintels. The architect of Cabot Tower, William Howe Greene, was a prominent St. John's architect and an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

Ellman, When Theories Touch: A Historical and Theoretical Integration of Psychoanalytic Thought, Karnac Books, 2010, p. 233.  Paranoid-schizoid position  In object relations theory, the paranoid-schizoid position is a state of mind of children, from birth to four or six months of age. Melanie Klein has described the earliest stages of infantile psychic life in terms of a successful completion of development through certain positions. A position, for Klein, is a set of psychic functions that correspond to a given phase of development, always appearing during the first year of life, but which are present at all times thereafter and can be reactivated at any time. There are two major positions: the paranoid-schizoid position and the subsequent depressive position. The earlier more primitive position is the paranoid-schizoid position and if an individual's environment and up-bringing are satisfactory, she or he will progress through the depressive position. The paranoid-schizoid position is considered the state of mind of children from birth to four or six months of age. Although this position develops into the next position, it is normal to move back and forward between the two positions although some people operate in the paranoid schizoid position for much of the time. As one of the originators of Object Relations theory, Klein sees emotions as always related to other people or objects of emotions. Relations during these first months are not to whole objects but only to part objects, such as the breast, the mother's hands, her face etc. Paranoid refers to the central paranoid anxiety, the fear of invasive malevolence. This is experienced as coming from the outside, but ultimately derives from the projection out of the death instinct. Paranoid anxiety can be understood in terms of anxiety about imminent annihilation and derives from a sense of the destructive or death instinct of the child. In this position before the secure internalisation of a good object to protect the ego, the immature ego deals with its anxiety by splitting off bad feelings and projecting them out. However, this causes paranoia. Schizoid refers to the central defense mechanism: splitting, the vigilant separation of the good object from the bad object. Klein posited that a healthy development implies that the infant has to split its external world, its objects and itself into two categories: good (i.e., gratifying, loved, loving) and bad (i.e. frustrating, hated, persecutory). This splitting makes it possible to introject and identify with the good. In other words: splitting in this stage is useful because it protects the good from being destroyed by the bad. Later, when the ego has developed sufficiently, the bad can be integrated, and ambivalence and conflict can be tolerated. Later, with greater maturity and the resolution of the depressive position, the ego is able to bring together the good and bad object, which leads to whole object relations. Achieving this involves mourning the loss of the idealised object, and associated depressive anxieties. Klein described development as proceeding through two phases: the paranoid-schizoid position and the depressive position.http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elljwp/klein.htm In the paranoid- schizoid position, the main anxiety is paranoia and hypochondria, and the fear is for the self. When things are going well, the mother is experienced as an all benign figure. However, inevitably when needs or desires of the young baby are not immediately met by the mother, because she is not there to fulfill them, the absence of the good object is experienced as the presence of the bad object. The bad object is then hated and attacked in phantasies. The hated frustrating object quickly becomes persecutory as it is imagined to get revenge in a similar way to how it is being treated. This is why the baby feels persecuted, hence the \\"paranoid\\" in paranoid schizoid. As well as the bad (aggressive, hateful) parts of the self deriving from the death instinct being projected onto the object, goodness is also projected onto the object. It is easier to see why badness is projected outside the self rather than it being felt to be within. It is more difficult to understand why goodness also may be projected out. The reason for this is that when the person does not feel that they can sustain goodness themselves, it is safer to project it into the object. This is the basis for idealisation, and it can be useful in certain situations, e.g. idealising a surgeon who is operating. The projection of badness into the object is the basis of racism, homophobia, or any other irrational hatred of another group seen as (but essentially not being) different from the self, e.g. estate agents, liberals, conservatives, cyclists, car drivers, single mothers, Northerners, Southerners, traffic wardens, etc. Over time the baby becomes more able to tolerate frustration and hold on to the good object for increasing periods, enabling the baby to tolerate its own bad impulses without fear that these will destroy it. This enables a more realistic view of the self and object as possessing both good and bad attributes, leading to the greater integration and maturity of the depressive position. Klein emphasizes that the good and bad parts of the self are projected onto or into the object. This represents the operation of the life and death drive, of love and hate. Depressive position Klein saw the depressive position as an important developmental milestone that continues to mature throughout the life span. The splitting and part object relations that characterize the earlier phase are succeeded by the capacity to perceive that the other who frustrates is also the one who gratifies. Schizoid defenses are still in evidence, but feelings of guilt, grief, and the desire for reparation gain dominance in the developing mind. In the depressive position, the infant is able to experience others as whole, which radically alters object relationships from the earlier phase. ‚ÄúBefore the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object. It is only in the depressive position that polar qualities can be seen as different aspects of the same object.‚Äù Increasing nearness of good and bad brings a corresponding integration of ego. In a development which Grotstein terms the \\"primal split\\", the infant becomes aware of separateness from the mother. This awareness allows guilt to arise in response to the infant‚Äôs previous aggressive phantasies when bad was split from good. The mother‚Äôs temporary absences allow for continuous restoration of her ‚Äúas an image of representation‚Äù in the infant mind. Symbolic thought may now arise, and can only emerge once access to the depressive position has been obtained. With the awareness of the primal split, a space is created in which the symbol, the symbolized, and the experiencing subject coexist. History, subjectivity, interiority, and empathy all become possible.. The anxieties characteristic of the depressive position shift from a fear of being destroyed to a fear of destroying others. In fact or phantasy, one now realizes the capacity to harm or drive away a person who one ambivalently loves. The defenses characteristic of the depressive position include the manic defenses, repression and reparation. The manic defenses are the same defenses evidenced in the paranoid-schizoid position, but now mobilized to protect the mind from depressive anxiety. As the depressive position brings about an increasing integration in the ego, earlier defenses change in character, becoming less intense and allowing increasing awareness of psychic reality. In working through depressive anxiety, projections are withdrawn, allowing the other more autonomy, reality, and a separate existence. The infant, whose destructive phantasies were directed towards the bad mother who frustrated, now begins to realize that bad and good, frustrating and satiating, it is always the same mother. Unconscious guilt for destructive phantasies arises in response to the continuing love and attention provided by caretakers. > [As] fears of losing the loved one become active, a very important step is > made in the development. These feelings of guilt and distress now enter as a > new element into the emotion of love. They become an inherent part of love, > and influence it profoundly both in quality and quantity. From this developmental milestone come a capacity for sympathy, responsibility to and concern for others, and an ability to identify with the subjective experience of people one cares about. With the withdrawal of the destructive projections, repression of the aggressive impulses takes place. The child allows caretakers a more separate existence, which facilitates increasing differentiation of inner and outer reality. Omnipotence is lessened, which corresponds to a decrease in guilt and the fear of loss. When all goes well, the developing child is able to comprehend that external others are autonomous people with their own needs and subjectivity. Previously, extended absences of the object (the good breast, the mother) was experienced as persecutory, and, according to the theory of unconscious phantasy, the persecuted infant phantisizes destruction of the bad object. The good object who then arrives is not the object which did not arrive. Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object. In phantasy, the good internal mother can be psychically destroyed by the aggressive impulses. It is crucial that the real parental figures are around to demonstrate the continuity of their love. In this way, the child perceives that what happens to good objects in phantasy does not happen to them in reality. Psychic reality is allowed to evolve as a place separate from the literalness of the physical world. Through repeated experience with good enough parenting, the internal image that the child has of external others, that is the child's internal object, is modified by experience and the image transforms, merging experiences of good and bad which becomes more similar to the real object (e.g. the mother, who can be both good and bad). In Freudian terms, the pleasure principle is modified by the reality principle. Melanie Klein saw this surfacing from the depressive position as a prerequisite for social life. Moreover, she viewed the establishment of an inside and an outside world as the start of interpersonal relationships. Klein argued that people who never succeed in working through the depressive position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense guilt feelings over the death of a loved one may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there because of a lack of differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a defense mechanism to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the internal object of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the internal object forever.  Further thinking regarding the positions  Wilfred Bion articulates the dynamic nature of the positions, a point emphasised by Thomas Ogden, and expanded by John Steiner in terms of '\\"The equilibrium between the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions\\"'.John Steiner, in Robin Anderson ed., Clinical Lectures on Klein and Bion (London 1992) p. 46-58 Ogden and James Grotstein have continued to explore early infantile states of mind, and incorporating the work of Donald Meltzer, Ester Bick and others, postulate a position preceding the paranoid- schizoid. Grotstein, following Bion, also hypothesizes a transcendent position which emerges following attainment of the depressive position. This aspect of both Ogden and Grotstein's work remains controversial for many within classical object relations theory.

The Keeling Curve measures the progressive buildup of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. Early life and early career Keeling was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Ralph Keeling and Grace L Keeling (n√©e Sherberne). His father, an investment banker, excited interests of astronomy in a 5-year-old Charles, while his mother instilled a lifelong love of music. He graduated with a degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1948. Charles Keeling earned a PhD in chemistry from Northwestern University in 1953 under Malcolm Dole, a polymer chemist. Most of Dole's graduates were going straight into the oil industry; Keeling \\"had trouble seeing the future this way\\" and had become interested in geology, for which he had acquired most of the undergraduate coursework during his PhD. Keeling had applied for postdoctoral positions as a chemist almost exclusively to geology departments \\"west of the continental divide.\\" He received an offer from Harrison Brown who had recently started a geochemistry department at California Institute of Technology. He was a postdoctoral fellow in geochemistry there until he joined Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1956, and was appointed professor of oceanography there in 1968. At Caltech he developed the first instrument able to measure carbon dioxide in atmospheric samples with consistently reliable accuracy. Keeling camped at Big Sur where he used his new device to measure the level of carbon dioxide and found that it had risen since the 19th century. Work with Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 1958‚Äì2005 Atmospheric CO2 concentrations measured at Mauna Loa Observatory: The Keeling Curve. Keeling worked at the Scripps Institution for 43 years during which time he published many influential papers. Roger Revelle, the Director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, based at La Jolla, California, persuaded Keeling to continue his work there. Revelle was also one of the founders of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957‚Äì58 and Keeling received IGY funding to establish a base on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, two miles (3,000 m) above sea level. Keeling started collecting carbon dioxide samples at the base in 1958. By 1960, he had established that there are strong seasonal variations in carbon dioxide levels with peak levels reached in the late northern hemisphere winter. A reduction in carbon dioxide followed during spring and early summer each year as plant growth increased in the land-rich northern hemisphere. In 1961, Keeling produced data showing that carbon dioxide levels were rising steadily in what later became known as the \\"Keeling Curve\\". In the early 1960s, the National Science Foundation stopped supporting his research, calling the outcome \\"routine\\". Despite this lack of interest, the Foundation used Keeling's research in its warning in 1963 of rapidly increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases. A 1965 report from President Johnson's Science Advisory Committee similarly warned of the dangers of extra heat-trapping gases, which cause the temperature of the Earth to rise. The data collection started by Keeling and continued at Mauna Loa is the longest continuous record of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the world and is considered a reliable indicator of the global trend in the mid-level troposphere. Keeling's research showed that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide grew from 315 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 380 (ppm) in 2005, with increases correlated to fossil fuel emissions. There has also been an increase in seasonal variation in samples from the late 20th century and early 21st century. Personal life Keeling was an enthusiastic outdoorsman who made many hiking and camping trips to the Western mountains, particularly the Cascade Mountains of Washington state. He was an active member of the Wilderness Society for much of his life.Paul M. Keeling, \\"The Path to Mauna Loa\\", Wilderness (2008): 12-14 Keeling married Louise Barthold in 1954. They had five children, one of whom (Ralph Keeling) followed in his father's footsteps and was a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Charles Keeling was also an accomplished classical pianist who almost chose a career in music. Keeling was a founding director of the University of California San Diego Madrigal Singers. He was also general chairman of the citizens committee which drafted the Del Mar General Plan (or \\"Community Plan\\") in 1975.Peter Kaye, San Diego Union-Tribune, \\"Plaque honors Del Mar planners\\" (June 24, 2007, retrieved May 25, 2015) Keeling died in 2005, aged 77, of a heart attack. Legacy * At a White House ceremony held in July 1997, Keeling was presented with a \\"special achievement award\\" from Vice President Al Gore.

History In the early 1960s both the Royal Marines, then largely based aboard commando carriers, and the British Army required a vehicle that could be carried by air to replace the Austin Champ. They had taken delivery of the Westland Wessex helicopter, which could carry a load slung beneath. The smallest Land Rover available at the time was a Series IIA 88 inch (2235 mm) wheelbase, which was too heavy. Land Rover began work on a lightweight version to fit the specifications in 1965. A new modification to the basic Series IIA was devised by making many body components easily detachable and removing many non-essential items. The result was the Land Rover Half-Ton, known widely as the Lightweight or Airportable. In practice, to reduce weight sufficiently for the helicopters of the day to lift them in combat conditions, the tilt (roof) and sticks, the upper parts of the body, the doors and windscreen were removed, to be refitted later. The most significant change, however, was a reduction in width by 4 inch (100 mm), by redesigning the standard Series IIA axles and fitting shorter half-shafts, which meant it would fit on a standard pallet. Complete, the Lightweight IIA weighed , over the specified weight. The term Lightweight appears misleading as a standard 88 Land Rover weighed , but the higher total weight was due to the various frame reinforcement required for military usage.Cremers, p. 149 However, with the removable body panels taken-off it was below the limit. Since improvements to the helicopters meant more lift was available, the MoD accepted it for use. The main applications were actually to be shipped by cargo aircraft or stacked on train wagons, with helicopter transport a rare occurrence. The first production models were completed on 11 November 1968, and production continued until 1984. Production 1970 Series IIa 1983 Series III HT with Danish registration. Although a very few prototypes had been built between 1965 and 1967, and about six pre-production models early in 1968, 'Lightweight' Series IIA quantity production began on 11 November 1968, with a total of 15 vehicles being produced on that day. Total production of Series IIa 'Lightweights' was between 1,500 and 2,000 vehicles. Later Series IIa models had the headlamps moved out into a revised front wing, to comply with revised lighting regulations. It is easy to confuse later Series IIa models with the Series III, though nothing was changed on these vehicles other than the location of the headlamps. The Series IIA Lightweight was replaced by the Series III Lightweight in 1972, soon after the replacement of the civilian Series IIA with the Series III. The vehicle remained in essence the same, with a few relatively minor changes - there are detail differences to the chassis; and a revised gearbox had synchromesh on second through fourth gears instead of just third and fourth. In the electrical department the Series III was fitted with an alternator in place of the dynamo of the Series IIa; the new indicator switch incorporates a headlamp flasher and horn; and the ignition switch was now fitted in a new steering column cowl instead of on the dashboard. The Lightweight did retain the earlier Series IIa metal dashboard even after the upgrade. Around 1980, in line with civilian models, the engine had five main bearings instead of three. Lightweight production ended in 1984, when the parent Land Rover Series III was replaced by the models 90 and 110. A total of 37,897 Lightweights, petrols and diesels, were built.

It is used in different traditions of Orthodox chant until today (‚Üí Neobyzantine Octoechos). The name \\"nana\\" is taken from the syllables (written in ligatures \\" Ö Ö\\") sung during the intonation which precedes a melody composed in this mode. The name \\"phthora\\" derived from the verb and means \\"destroy\\" or \\"corrupt\\". It was usually referred to the diatonic genus of the eight mode system and as a sign used in Byzantine chant notation it indicated a \\"change to another genus\\" (), in the particular case of phthora nana a change to the enharmonic genus. Today the \\"nana\\" intonation has become the standard name of the third authentic mode which is called \\"echos tritos\\" () in Greek and \\"third glas\\" () in Old Church Slavonic.  The different functions of phthora nana  In the theory and notation of Byzantine and Orthodox chant nana is the name of a special phthora which had been used in different ways according to its historic context:For a general description of the different aspects of phthora see Ioannis Zannos (1994, 181‚Äì187). #as a phthora which has its proper melos (intonation and cadence formulas), it may denote a special kind of echos (mode) that has been identified with the echos tritos (third mode) since the 16th century, but deviates from the later diatonic echos tritos by the division of its tonal system and its tetrachord. The name \\"\\" ( Ö Ö) was used for its proper enechema, and within the Hagiopolitan Octoechos whole troparia can be found in the tropologion or the chant book Octoechos which are composed in the melos of phthora nana (). #within the heirmologic or sticheraric melos, it may denote a temporary change to the enharmonic genus () and to the triphonic tone system () within another mode, like echos tritos, echos plagios tetartos or echos plagios protos (plagal first mode) for instance, to an intervallic structure and tone system that is proper to phthora nana as an own echos.See Andr√© Barbera's article about \\"Metabole.\\" \\"Triphonia\\" () is the Greek name for a tone system which is organized in conjunct tetrachords, in case of Nana: C ‚ÄîD ‚ÄîE ‚ÄîF ‚ÄîG ‚Äîa ‚Äîb flat . It also corresponds to the ancient Greek \\"lesser perfect system.\\" #as echos kratema, phthora nana could used as an own mode which had been used in improvised sections like kratemata or teretismoi which had been sung over abstract syllables. Byzantine composers like Manuel Chrysaphes the Lampadarios mentioned, that the phthora nana always leads to the echos plagios tetartos (fourth plagal mode), before the melos can change into another mode. #as exoteric \\"phthora atzem\\", the sign was used for the transcription of music composed in makam acem, a makam connected to a certain Persian dastgah. #as a modulation sign, phthora nana played a crucial role to change between the third to the plagal fourth mode. Hence, there can be found some parallels between the b flat as used by Guido of Arezzo, and the temporary use of phthora nana in psaltic compositions which changed between the modes. As such phthora nana was used as an alteration sign within the heptaphonic solfeggio of Chrysanthos' New Method, which transcribed its triphonic tone system by a frequent use transposition (a certain which turns into similar to the Guidonian mutation memorised as ¬´F fa ut¬ª).  Hagiopolites treatise about phthora nana  It is supposed that the Hagiopolites treatise served during the 9th century as a manual preceding a chant book called tropologion. The book contained a collection of simple hymns troparia as well as heirmoi which served as melodic models () for the 10 modes of Octoechos. Nana holds the status one of the two \\"special\\" additional echoi or \\"mesoi\\" (medial forms between authentic and plagal echoi) in the system of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos. The other one is called nenano. Already in the Hagiopolites treatise the phthorai nana and nenano have been characterized as both echoi and \\"not echoi, but phthorai\\" (‚Üí phthora). This means that they were proper modes with their own models, but they had to be integrated within the Octoechos and its eight-week cycle.See the quotation in the article of phthora nenano which concerned both phthorai. Thus, phthora nana was subordinated to the tetartos, and the treatise also referred to it as \\"Mesos tetartos\\": as a third medial mode of the tetartos which was neither authentic (kyrios) nor plagal (plagios). dialogue treatise (GR-AOd Ms. 570, f. 21r) dialogue treatise (GR-AOd Ms. 570, f. 21v)  Phthora nana according to the theory and practice of psaltic art  The concrete intervals of the enharmonic genus are less subject than the explanation of relationships between the modes. Often certain paragraphs of the Hagiopolites concerned about the phthora nana have been re-interpreted again and again according to the current tradition of psaltic art.See the quotations collected by Ioannis Zannos (1994, 103‚Äì117). = Its enechema = In contemporary theoretical explanations the phthora nana had not only been regarded as a melodic model for stichera and heirmoi, but also as a transition model as well, which mainly connected tritos with tetartos echoi.GB-Lbl Ms. Harley 5544, f. 35v) According to theoretical explanations of the Papadike, phthora nana was not only defined by its melos like a proper echos itself, as such it had been subordinated to certain echoi already in the Hagiopolites treatise. Manuel Chrysaphes, Lampadarios at the Byzantine court, emphasised that phthora nana is only used as a phthora of the echos tritos, but within its melos it causes always a change into the echos plagios tetartos. Any other changes have to be made after the transition into the plagios tetartos: > .Manuel Chrysaphes (Conomos 1985, 58f). He also mentioned that the phthora had its own solf√®ge (parallage), so that it solved the diatonic echos tritos and binds it to the echos plagios tetartos ( \\"binding and solving\\"). > .Manuel Chrysaphes (Conomos 1985, 58f). The distinction, that it was by the own solf√®ge (apo parallagon) \\"like a kyrios echos of its own\\" (os echos kyrios),Manuel Chrysaphes illustrates the autonomy of phthora nana, that whole heirmoi, idiomela and prosomoia, stichera kalophonika, alleluiaria and polyeleoi had been composed just in this phthora as if it was a real kyrios echos. meant on the surface, that the tritos could be based on the octave on B flat (heptaphonia) with the finalis F, while it had to change into the tetartos octave which was based on C and therefore used b natural as seventh degree.Likewise it could change from tritos, F‚Äîf with the finalis c, to the tetartos octave (G‚Äîg with f sharp) and its plagal finalis G. The triphonic solf√®ge could be solved again from the enharmonic into the diatonic genus, but it was in fact not just a change of the genus (, metavole kata genos), but also a change from the triphonic into the tetraphonic tone system (, metavole kata systema).Zum Begriff der \\"Metabole\\" siehe Barbera (2011). It was not organised by separated tetrachords (tetraphonia), but by connected ones (triphonia: C‚ÄîF‚Äîb flat). Hence, the \\"own triphonic parallage\\" intermediated between both octave species, which were otherwise very far from each other. Already in this transitional function it formed an alternative melos of the tetartos echoi. = Its tone system = The phthora could intermediate, because it was distinct by its triphonic tone system and its enharmonic genus (the minor tone was always on the top of a tetrachord and smaller than a Western half tone‚Äîa diesis). Ioannis Plousiadinos invented an own system of parallage in shape of a square made up by four X. It was constructed to represent the triphonic combinations of conjunct tetrachords, but only the last two X on the bottom described the triphonia of the phthora nana‚Äîthe triphonia based on echos varys (left) and the triphonia based on the plagios tetartos (right). Both possibilities were illustrated at the end of John Koukouzeles' didactic chant Mega Ison.See Kyriatzides' edition (1896, 141‚Äì144) of Chourmouzios' transcription (EBE MŒ†Œ§ 703). \\"\\" in an 18th-century manuscript (Athos, Docheiariou monastery, Ms. 319, fol. 18v) = Its great sign and its dynamis as echos kratema = The Papadikai list between six and ten phthorai which represent the ten modes of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos‚Äîthe diatonic eight modes (which did not need eight phthorai, since the echoi just represented the four elements of a tetrachord) and the two additional phthorai as their own echoi.A published collection of Byzantine music treatises is found in Lorenzo Tardo's ¬´L'antica melurgia bizantina¬ª (1938). GB-Lbl Ms. Harley 5544, f. 5v). In this very particular sense, the term \\"phthora\\" did neither refer to nenano nor nana, but simply meant the use of a transposition sign in order to indicate the precise place of a temporary transposition (). > .Manuel Chrysaphes (Conomos 1985, 58). > Note also, that these phthorai [ and ] are different from those of , and or > , since the phthorai of the latter [diatonic] echoi bind or solve quickly > and thus, they only create a temporary change from one echos to another one, > this is the only purpose they have. The list of phthora did not include one to indicate a change into the melos of phthora nana. This change was instead caused by one of the great signs (), the xeron klasma (), like here in the sticherarion of the Biblioteca ambrosiana, where the medial signature of phthora nana (a temporary change into its melos) is prepared by this great sign.For a general study see the dissertation by Maria Alexandru (2000).I-Ma Ms. gr. A139 sup., f. 141v). This sticheron could be sung as well by a protopsaltes in the soloistic kalophonic style. If the medial signature of nana was the end of the section chosen for the realisation of a sticheron kalophonikon, this sign could cause, that a whole kratema, a section in abstract syllables like for instance, was created in the phthora nana as an echos kratema.See for example the sticheron kalophonikon over the first section of the sticheron idiomelon in echos tetartos dedicated to Saint Peter (29 June ). John Koukouzeles' kratima was composed in phthora nana as \\"echos kratema.\\"  Nana as exoteric phthora atzem  The phthora nana was called in various theories \\"phthora atzem\\" which referred to perde acem (the fret on the long necked lute tambur called \\"acem\\" which was a common reference for Ottoman musicians) or even to makam acem‚Äîthe \\"Persian makam\\" or \\"phthora.\\" Panagiotes Keltzanides' edition offered a seyir‚Äîa melodic example to illustrate makam acem‚Äîon page 81: Keltzanides 1881, 81) It is close to the melodic models of the Persian DastgƒÅh-e ≈†ur.  The enharmonic echoi of the current Octoechos  The reform of the Byzantine neume notation in the early 19th century redefined the mele according to each genre (troparic, heirmologic, sticheraric, papadic), it also transcribed for the first time the rhythm which was so far part of an oral tradition or method, how to do the thesis of the melos. In these transcriptions the diatonic tritos echoi had little relevance. Chrysanthos of Madytos, together with Chourmouzios the Archivist and Gregorios the Protopsaltes one of the three \\"great teachers\\" that undertook the reform, published a treatise explaining the principles of the new system, entitled \\"Theoretikon Mega tes Mousikes\\".Chrysanthos (1832). While there was once a diatonic form of echos tritos and echos varys, it has no longer any relevance for the current tradition of Orthodox chant, even if it based on Byzantine monodic chant. Orthodox chanters know nowadays only the intonation \\"nana\\" (), when they would like to perform melodies composed in echos tritos. Already Papadikai of the 16th century identified \\"nana\\" signature in their lists with the diatonic intonation \\"aneanes.\\"See GB-Lbl Harley 5544, fol. 7r-v. But its long formula was already replaced by the short of in Chrysanthos explanation of the former papadic practice of solf√®ge using the enechemata: 1832, p. 30) This simple form is used until today, but Chrysanthos also developed its whole melos as a kind of exegesis (\\"interpretation\\") of the simple traditional echema of phthora nana: Chrysanthos 1832, 137f) Chrysanthos 1832, 138‚Äî¬ß311) Chrysanthos' exegesis of the real nana intonation uses the enharmonic intervals: > .Chrysanthos (1832, p. 114, ¬ß 261). > Hence, if the melos of the enharmonic genus starts on F , F Œ≥Œ± and b flat > [‚àí6] should be symphonous, and not the phthongos c ŒΩŒ∑'. And like the > diatonic and chromatic scales are made of tetraphonia, here they are made of > triphonia: :::C ŒΩŒ∑‚ÄîD œÄŒ±‚ÄîE sharp []‚ÄîF , F ‚ÄîG ‚Äîa ‚Äîb flat [‚àí6], b flat [‚àí6]‚Äîc ‚Äîd ‚Äîe flat [‚àí6]. > Thus, also conjunct similar tetrachords are constructed by the same > intervals in the middle [12+13+3=28]: C ‚ÄîD is equal to F ‚ÄîG , D ‚ÄîE sharp [] > to G ‚Äîa , E sharp []‚ÄîF is equal to a ‚Äîb flat [‚àí6], etc. He applied this intonation to the traditional varys enechema: Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß313) Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß313) There is also a diatonic form of echos varys,According to Georgios Konstantinou (1997), the theory of the school of Lycourgos Angelopoulos and Simon Karas, also the phthora nana is sung in a so-called \\"hard diatonic\\" intonation which sounds like the modern equal temperament in comparison with traditional singers, who still intone the melos of the phthora with enharmonic intervals. but according to Chrysanthos' adaption to the Ottoman tone system it was no longer based on a pentachord between kyrios tritos and varys, but on a tritonus on a low b natural.Oliver Gerlach (2015).

Such items may be used in wet environments or underwater to specified depths. Water-resistant and waterproof often refer to penetration of water in its liquid state and possibly under pressure, whereas damp proof refers to resistance to humidity or dampness. Permeation of water vapour through a material or structure is reported as a moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR). The hulls of boats and ships were once waterproofed by applying tar or pitch. Modern items may be waterproofed by applying water- repellent coatings or by sealing seams with gaskets or o-rings. Waterproofing is used in reference to building structures (such as basements, decks, or wet areas), watercraft, canvas, clothing (raincoats or waders), electronic devices and paper packaging (such as cartons for liquids). In construction In construction, a building or structure is waterproofed with the use of membranes and coatings to protect contents and structural integrity. The waterproofing of the building envelope in construction specifications is listed under 07 - Thermal and Moisture Protection within MasterFormat 2004, by the Construction Specifications Institute, and includes roofing and waterproofing materials. In building construction, waterproofing is a fundamental aspect of creating a building envelope, which is a controlled environment. The roof covering materials, siding, foundations, and all of the various penetrations through these surfaces must be water-resistant and sometimes waterproof. Roofing materials are generally designed to be water- resistant and shed water from a sloping roof, but in some conditions, such as ice damming and on flat roofs, the roofing must be waterproof. Many types of waterproof membrane systems are available, including felt paper or tar paper with asphalt or tar to make a built-up roof, other bituminous waterproofing, ethylene propylene diene monomer EPDM rubber, hypalon, polyvinyl chloride, liquid roofing, and more. Walls are not subjected to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps are designed to be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have vapor barriers or air barriers. Damp proofing is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete. Within the waterproofing industry, below-ground waterproofing is generally divided into two areas: * Tanking: This is waterproofing used where the below-ground structure will be sitting in the water table continuously or periodically. This causes hydrostatic pressure on both the membrane and structure and requires full encapsulation of the basement structure in a tanking membrane, under slab and walls. * Damp proofing: This is waterproofing used where the water table is lower than the structure and there is good free-draining fill. The membrane deals with the shedding of water and the ingress of water vapor only, with no hydrostatic pressure. Generally, this incorporates a damp proof membrane (DPM) to the walls with a polythene DPM under the slab. With higher grade DPM, some protection from short-term Hydrostatic pressure can be gained by transitioning the higher quality wall DPM to the slab polythene under the footing, rather than at the footing face. In buildings using earth sheltering, a potential problem is a too much humidity, so waterproofing is critical. Water seepage can lead to mold growth, causing significant damage and air quality issues. Properly waterproofing foundation walls is required to prevent deterioration and seepage. Another specialized area of waterproofing is rooftop decks and balconies. Waterproofing systems have become quite sophisticated and are a very specialized area. Failed waterproof decks, polymer or tile, are one of the leading causes of water damage to building structures, and of personal injury when they fail. Where major problems occur in the construction industry is when improper products are used for the wrong application. While the term waterproof is used for many products, each of them has a very specific area of application, and when manufacturer specifications and installation procedures are not followed, the consequences can be severe. Another factor is the impact of expansion and contraction on waterproofing systems for decks. Decks constantly move with changes in temperatures, putting stress on the waterproofing systems. One of the leading causes of waterproof deck system failures is the movement of underlying substrates (plywood) that cause too much stress on the membranes resulting in a failure of the system. While beyond the scope of this reference document, waterproofing of decks and balconies is a complex of many complimentary elements. These include the waterproofing membrane used, adequate slope-drainage, proper flashing details, and proper construction materials. The penetrations through a building envelope must be built in a way such that water does not enter the building, such as using flashing and special fittings for pipes, vents, wires, etc. Some caulkings are durable, but many are unreliable for waterproofing. Also, many types of geomembranes are available to control water, gases, or pollution. From the late 1990s to the 2010s, the construction industry has had technological advances in waterproofing materials, including integral waterproofing systems and more advanced membrane materials. Integral systems such as hycrete work within the matrix of a concrete structure, giving the concrete itself a waterproof quality. There are two main types of integral waterproofing systems: the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic systems. A hydrophilic system typically uses a crystallization technology that replaces the water in the concrete with insoluble crystals. Various brands available in the market claim similar properties, but not all can react with a wide range of cement hydration by-products and thus require caution. Hydrophobic systems use concrete sealers or even fatty acids to block pores within the concrete, preventing water passage. Sometimes the same materials used to keep water out of buildings are used to keep water in, such as a pool or pond liners. New membrane materials seek to overcome shortcomings in older methods like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Generally, new technology in waterproof membranes relies on polymer-based materials that are very adhesive to create a seamless barrier around the outside of a structure. Waterproofing should not be confused with roofing, since roofing cannot necessarily withstand hydrostatic head while waterproofing can. The standards for waterproofing bathrooms in domestic construction have improved over the years, due in large part to the general tightening of building codes. In clothing Some garments, and tents, are designed to give greater or lesser protection against rain. For urban use raincoats and jackets are used; for outdoor activities in rough weather there is a range of hiking apparel. Typical descriptions are \\"showerproof\\", \\"water resistant\\", and \\"waterproof\\". These terms are not precisely defined. A showerproof garment will usually be treated with a water-resisting coating, but is not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. This is suitable for protection against light rain, but after a short time water will penetrate. A water-resistant garment is similar, perhaps slightly more resistant to water but also not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. A garment described as waterproof will have a water-repellent coating, with the seams also taped to prevent water ingress there. Better waterproof garments have a membrane lining designed to keep water out but allow trapped moisture to escape (\\"breathability\\")‚Äîa totally waterproof garment would retain body sweat and become clammy. Waterproof garments specify their hydrostatic rating, ranging from 1,500 for light rain, to 20,000 for heavy rain. Waterproof garments are intended for use in weather conditions which are often windy as well as wet and are usually also wind resistant. Footwear can also be made waterproof by using a variety of methods including but not limited to, the application of beeswax, waterproofing spray, or mink oil In other objects Waterproofing methods have been implemented in many types of objects, including paper packaging, cosmetics, and more recently, consumer electronics. Electronic devices used in military and severe commercial environments are routinely conformally coated in accordance with IPC-CC-830 to resist moisture and corrosion but encapsulation is needed to become truly waterproof. Even though it is possible to find waterproof wrapping or other types of protective cases for electronic devices, a new technology-enabled the release of diverse waterproof smartphones and tablets in 2013. This method is based on a special nanotechnology coating a thousand times thinner than a human hair which protects electronic equipment from damage due to the penetration of water. Several manufacturers use the nano coating method on their smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras. A water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface A 2013 study found that nanotextured surfaces using cone forms produce highly water-repellent surfaces. These nanocone textures are superhydrophobic (extremely water-hating).

Ampacity is defined as the maximum current, in amperes, that a conductor can carry continuously under the conditions of use without exceeding its temperature rating. Also described as current-carrying capacity. The ampacity of a conductor depends on its ability to dissipate heat without damage to the conductor or its insulation. This is a function of the insulation temperature rating, the electrical resistance of the conductor material, the ambient temperature, and the ability of the insulated conductor to dissipate heat to the surrounds. All common electrical conductors have some resistance to the flow of electricity. Electric current flowing through them causes voltage drop and power dissipation, which heats conductors. Copper or aluminum can conduct a large amount of current without damage, but long before conductor damage, insulation would, typically, be damaged by the resultant heat. The ampacity for a conductor is based on physical and electrical properties of the material and construction of the conductor and of its insulation, ambient temperature, and environmental conditions adjacent to the conductor. Having a large overall surface area can dissipate heat well if the environment can absorb the heat. In electrical cables different conditions govern, and installation regulations normally specify that the most severe condition along the run will govern each cable conductor's rating. Cables run in wet or oily locations may carry a lower temperature rating than in a dry installation. Derating is necessary for multiple cables in proximity. When multiple cables are in proximity, each contributes heat to the others and diminishes the amount of external cooling affecting the individual cable conductors. The overall ampacity of insulated cable conductors in a bundle of more than three cables must also be derated, whether in a raceway or cable. Usually the derating factor is tabulated in a nation's wiring regulations. Depending on the type of insulating material, common maximum allowable temperatures at the surface of the conductor are 60, 75, and 90 ¬∞C, often with an ambient air temperature of 30 ¬∞C. In the United States, 105 ¬∞C is allowed with ambient of 40 ¬∞C, for larger power cables, especially those operating at more than 2 kV. Likewise, specific insulations are rated 150, 200, or 250 ¬∞C. The allowed current in a conductor generally needs to be decreased (derated) when conductors are in a grouping or cable, enclosed in conduit, or an enclosure restricting heat dissipation. e.g. The United States National Electrical Code, Table 310.15(B)(16), specifies that up to three 8 AWG copper wires having a common insulating material (THWN) in a raceway, cable, or direct burial has an ampacity of 50 A when the ambient air is 30 ¬∞C, the conductor surface temperature allowed to be 75 ¬∞C. A single insulated conductor in free air has 70 A rating. Ampacity rating is normally for continuous current, and short periods of overcurrent occur without harm in most cabling systems. Electrical code rules will give ratings for wiring where short-term loads are present, for example, in a hoisting motor. For systems such as underground power transmission cables, evaluation of the short-term over-load capacity of the cable system requires a detailed analysis of the cable's thermal environment and an evaluation of the commercial value of the lost service life due to excess temperature rise. Design of an electrical system will normally include consideration of the current-carrying capacity of all conductors of the system. Some devices are limited by power rating, and when this power rating occurs below their current limit, it is not necessary to know the current limit to design a system. A common example of this is lightbulb holders. Current rating For electronic components (such as transistors, voltage regulators, and the like), the term current rating is more-commonly used than ampacity, but the considerations are broadly similar. However the tolerance of short-term overcurrent is near zero for semiconductor devices, as their thermal capacities are extremely small.

Programmers can mark program elements (e.g. classes and methods) with attributes to indicate that they maintain application-specific or domain- specific semantics. For example, some programmers may define a \\"logging\\" attribute and associate it with a method to indicate the method should implement a logging function, while other programmers may define a \\"web service\\" attribute and associate it with a class to indicate the class should be implemented as a web service. Attributes separate application's core logic (or business logic) from application-specific or domain-specific semantics (e.g. logging and web service functions). By hiding the implementation details of those semantics from program code, attributes increase the level of programming abstraction and reduce programming complexity, resulting in simpler and more readable programs.

The movement was modeled on the Young Germany () movement led by Heinrich Heine. Originally a derogatory epithet applied to these nationalist intellectuals by their mostly Baltic German opponents, the term \\"Young Latvia\\" () was first used by Gustav Wilhelm Sigmund Brasche, the pastor of Nƒ´ca, in a review of Juris AlunƒÅns' Dziesmi≈Üas latvie≈°u valodai pƒÅrtulkotas (\\"Little Songs Translated for the Latvian Language\\") in the newspaper Das Inland in 1856. Asking who could appreciate such literature in Latvian (AlunƒÅns' book was the first major translation of classic foreign poetry into Latvian), Brasche warned that those daring to dream of \\"a Young Latvia\\" would meet the tragic fate of the boatman in Heine's poem \\"Die Lorelei,\\" a translation of which appeared in AlunƒÅns' anthology. The New Latvians were also sometimes known as \\"Lettophiles\\" or \\"tautƒ´bnieki\\" (\\"ethnicists\\").  Beginnings  Though the New Latvians can be seen as part of a primarily cultural and literary movement, their cause had significant political ramifications due to the socio-economic conditions then prevailing in Latvia (part of the Russian Empire, it was nonetheless dominated by the Baltic German nobility). 1856 is usually given as the date of the movement's beginning because of the publication of AlunƒÅns' book and the founding of the major Latvian language newspaper MƒÅjas Viesis which provided a counterpoint to the pro-German newspaper Latvie≈°u Avƒ´zes. Another contemporary and seminal event was the public declaration of nationality by a leader of the movement, Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs; a student at the University of Tartu (then Dorpat) from 1854 to 1858, ValdemƒÅrs affixed a carte de visite to his door that read \\"C. Woldemar stud. cam. Latweetis.\\" At the time, it was almost unheard of for an educated person to call himself a Latvian; education meant Germanisation, and ValdemƒÅrs' act has been compared to Martin Luther's posting of the 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg in its importance for Latvian nationalism. Just as some scholars consider the posting of the 95 Theses to be apocryphal, ValdemƒÅrs' notice can be seen as less dramatic if taken in context. The historian Arveds ≈†vƒÅbe noted that ValdemƒÅrs denied being a radical in his own writings; the New Latvians had no political program threatening the Baltic Germans until the 1860s; according to ≈†vƒÅbe, their political opposition to the prevailing order was crystallized under the influence of the Slavophiles in connection to the reforms of Alexander II of Russia.  Leaders  Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs, leader of the movement ValdemƒÅrs is seen as the spiritual father of the Awakening. With AlunƒÅns, he led student gatherings while at Tartu and advocated the study of folklore and the founding of marine academies to turn the Latvians and Estonians into seafaring peoples. Kri≈°jƒÅnis Barons began collecting dainas under ValdemƒÅrs' direct influence, and in 1862 ValdemƒÅrs, AlunƒÅns and Barons collaborated in St. Petersburg to publish Pƒìterburgas Avƒ´zes. The most radical newspaper hitherto published in Latvian, it was closed by the authorities in 1865. From 1867 to 1873, Atis Kronvalds (often known as Kronvaldu Atis) renewed the \\"Latvian evenings\\" begun by ValdemƒÅrs at Tartu. His Nationale Bestrebungen (1872) can be seen as the manifesto of the New Latvians. Two of their older colleagues included Kaspars BiezbƒÅrdis, the first ethnic Latvian philologist, who helped draft petitions to the tsar on the harsh conditions among the Latvian peasantry (for which he was exiled to Kaluga in 1863), and Andrejs SpƒÅƒ£is, the first writer to draw western European attention to the Baltic problem. Fricis Brƒ´vzemnieks (Treuland) is considered the father of Latvian folkloristics; Barons later made the collection of dainas his life's work. The poet Auseklis (the nom de plume of Krogzemju Mikus), in the diplomat and scholar Arnolds Spekke's words, represented \\"the romantic and mystic search for the nation's soul.\\" The Young Latvian Andrejs Pumpurs later penned the national epic LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, \\"The Bear Slayer.\\"  Directions and divisions  Defining the movement in retrospect in 1889, Pumpurs wrote: \\"Those in the grouping that for twenty-five years fought for freedom were called the New Latvians. Their fate was almost always the same. Without a homeland, their people devoid of rights, without goods or sustenance, often without lodging and without bread, they were doomed to wandering. All doors were locked before them, and they were prevented from finding residences or jobs. With a heavy heart they left their beloved homeland and went abroad, into the interior of Russia, searching for sustenance and at the same time gathering knowledge.\\" In fact, close to half of the ethnic Latvians who received a higher education were forced to seek work in Russia. As ≈†vƒÅbe saw it: \\"With their selfish and shortsighted politics, the [Baltic] German aristocracy and bourgeoisie pressure Latvians into Russophilia.\\" Even Baltic German intellectuals devoted to the study of the Latvian culture and language, like August Johann Gottfried Bielenstein (the editor of Latvie≈°u Avƒ´zes), opposed the New Latvians -- whilst the editor of Die Zeitung f√ºr Stadt und Land declared that \\"to be educated and Latvian is impossible -- an educated Latvian is a nothing\\" (\\"sei ein Unding\\"). Pastor Brasche, writing that there is no Latvian nation and that the Latvian people have no past, suggested replacing \\"New Latvians\\" with the term \\"New Peasants\\" (\\"Jung-Bauernstand\\"). The foremost Lutheran publication declared that Latvians had been a nation in the 13th century but had since been reduced to a peasant class; did every class require its own language? \\"The Latvian must die.\\" Ethnic Latvian supporters of the Baltic Germans came to be known as \\"Old Latvians\\"; partly because many of the New Latvians' opponents were associated with the Lutheran church, the movement also had a pronounced anti-clerical character. Though one stream of the National Awakening was at first centered in Tartu, moved to St. Petersburg, and later shifted to Moscow, in the late 1860s Lettophiles finally succeeded in establishing themselves in Latvia, by founding a relief fund for victims of the famine in Estonia and Finland in 1867 and receiving permission to establish the Riga Latvian Association a year later. Similar associations followed in other towns, the Rƒ´ga original receiving the hypocorisma \\"mommy\\" (\\"mƒÅmuƒºa\\"). The Rƒ´ga Latvian Association staged the first Latvian play, held the first conference of Latvian teachers, and organized the first Latvian song festival in 1873. ValdemƒÅrs engaged in polemics with Keuchel (the author of \\"sei ein Unding\\"), penning Nationale Bestrebungen in German as a response to his critics. A pragmatist and materialist, ValdemƒÅrs -- in exile and under police supervision in Moscow -- came further under the influence of the Slavophiles, working for the publisher Mikhail Nikiforovich Katkov. To ValdemƒÅrs, \\"the kulak could never be as dangerous as the German's nails of flint.\\" Legacy The efforts by Barons and other Young Latvians to collect folklore and dainas became vital for the forming of the Baltic neopagan movement Dievturƒ´ba, which was created in the 1920s by Ernests Brasti≈Ü≈° and KƒÅrlis Marovskis-Breg≈æis.

She served as a Member of Parliament from 1973 to 1989, representing the county of Nordland, as the first parliamentary leader of the Socialist Left Party from 1977 to 1989. She was a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1991 to 2002, and served as the committee's vice chair from 1993 to 1998. During her term on the Nobel committee, she participated in the decisions to award the Nobel Peace Prize to individuals such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat and Kofi Annan. She worked for the thoroughly nazified German Red Cross in the ending years of the Second World War, and she was convicted for treason following her repatriation to Norway in 1947. By profession, she was a teacher. Early life Hanna Kvanmo grew up in a working-class family in the Norwegian town Harstad. Her father was a fisherman and her mother was a factory worker. Her parents were divorced, and she was brought up mostly by her mother. As an 18-year-old (in 1944), Kvanmo joined the German Red Cross as a nursing student. She was stationed for some time on the Eastern Front, and in the last days of the war, she worked as a practical nurse in Berlin. After the German defeat, she was interned in the British sector of Germany; she was returned to Norway in late 1947 where she was tried and convicted for treason. She received an 8-month prison sentence and a ten-year suspension of her rights as a citizen; the prison sentence was suspended after an appeal to the Supreme Court. Career After several years as a single mother working as a cleaning lady and cook, she married and passed the university entrance exam (examen artium) with distinction and worked as a gymnasium teacher at Rana Gymnasium from 1962 to 1973. Kvanmo joined local politics in Rana, and in 1973 she was elected to the Storting, representing the Socialist Left Party (SV). From 1977 she served as the parliamentary leader for the party. In 1975 and 1981 she was also a delegate to the UN general assembly. From 1985-1989, her vararepresentant was Asle Amundsen. She retired from parliament in 1989. From 1991 to 2002, she was a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, serving as the committee's vice chairman 1993-1998. Her activities during the war were often questioned later in her political career in the Socialist Left Party. She described her perspective and her reasons for joining the German war effort in a book in 1990. The book sold approximately 83,000 copies in Norway, and was considered a best-seller. Kvanmo was an opponent of the EU. After her retiring from parliament she moved with her husband to southern Norway and the town of Arendal. Views She was highly critical of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for their efforts of negotiating Israeli-Egyptian peace in the late 1970s. The Socialist Left Party, with Hanna Kvanmo as its leader, was the only party in the Norwegian Parliament that advocated recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1980s. She later wished to withdraw the Peace Prize awarded to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Books *Derfor (1985) *Glis (1986) *Dommen (1990) *Anders Langes saga (1993, with A. Rygnestad).

It stars Sean Connery, Harry Andrews, Ian Bannen, Ossie Davis, Ian Hendry, Alfred Lynch, Roy Kinnear and Michael Redgrave. Plot In a British Army \\"glasshouse\\" (military prison) in the Libyan desert, prisoners convicted of service offences such as insubordination, being drunk while on duty, going AWOL or petty theft etc. are subjected to repetitive drill routines as a punishment in the blazing desert heat. The arrival of five new prisoners slowly leads to a clash with the camp authorities. One new NCO guard who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments, which include forcing the five newcomers to repeatedly climb a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies, a power struggle erupts between brutal Staff Sergeant Williams (Ian Hendry), humane Staff Sergeant Harris (Ian Bannen), Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson (Harry Andrews) and the camp's medical officer (Michael Redgrave) as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles. Roberts (Sean Connery) is a former squadron sergeant major from the Royal Tank Regiment, convicted of assaulting his commanding officer ‚Äì which he explains to his fellow inmates was because he was ordered to lead his men in a senseless suicidal attack. Roberts openly scorns Williams's brutality and serves as challenge to his authority. The RSM is a career soldier, powerful within the prison in which he is working, but realistic, \\"No one's going to pin a medal on us\\". However, he sees his duty to be as important as any other ‚Äì that of breaking down failed soldiers, then building them back up again, in his words, \\"Into men!\\" Staff Sergeant Williams is new to the prison, and his ambition is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as means for promotion. When Roberts is accused of cowardice, he asks Staff Sergeant Williams, \\"And what are you supposed to be ‚Äì a brave man in a permanent base job?\\" The RSM also questions Staff Sergeant Williams's motives for getting out of London, as in another scene, he slyly mentions the fact that the Germans were bombing the UK (including the civilian prison Williams worked at) just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Williams openly admits that he is trying to impress the RSM by showing that he has got what it takes to do the job, and attempts to undermine the RSM with a late night drinking contest. Staff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathises with the men, too closely, according to the RSM. The officers, both the CO (Norman Bird) and the medical officer, take their duties casually and, as Roberts points out, \\"everyone is doing time here, even the screws\\" (prison officers). In the finale, the camp's medical officer and Staff Sergeant Harris decide to report the abuses at the camp. Sadistic Staff Sergeant Williams goes to administer one final, perhaps fatal, beating to Roberts, when two prisoners intervene and appear to attack and very severely beat Williams. Roberts pleads with them to stop, knowing that if the prisoners beat up a prison officer, then any case they may have had against them is hopelessly lost, they are still prisoners, and the prison staff have a much stronger hand to inflict whatever cruelty they now wish to.

Movie rights were bought by Seven Arts Productions, which had a production deal with MGM. Producer Kenneth Hyman arranged for Rigby's script to be rewritten by other people, but when Sidney Lumet came on board as director, Lumet went back to Rigby's original draft. He and Rigby did cut out around 100 pages of material before filming. \\"There really isn't a lot of story\\", said Lumet. \\"It's all character ‚Äì a group of men, prisoners and jailers alike, driven by the same motive force, fear.\\" Sean Connery agreed to play the lead because it represented such a change of pace from James Bond. \\"It is only because of my reputation as Bond that the backers put up the money for The Hill\\", he said. Lumet says he told Connery before filming began that, \\"'I'm going to make brutal demands of you, physically and emotionally', and he knew I'm not a director who has too much respect for 'stars' as such. The result is beyond my hopes. He is real and tough and not at all smooth or nice. In a way he's a 'heavy' but the real heavy is the Army.\\" Filming took place in Almer√≠a, Spain starting 8 September 1964. An old Spanish fort in M√°laga was used for the prison. Many people associated with the production had regarded the filming as pleasant, despite difficult conditions: Temperatures went above 46 ¬∞C (114 ¬∞F) and nearly all the cast and crew became ill, even though thousands of gallons of fresh water were brought in.Ben Mankiewicz on Turner Classic Movies The Hill did not perform well in cinemas, although it received excellent reviews and Ray Rigby's screenplay won at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival. Rigby published a novel of the story in 1965.

The sperm types might differ in size, shape and/or chromosome complement. Sperm heteromorphism is also called sperm polymorphism or sperm dimorphism (for species with two sperm types). Typically, only one sperm type is capable of fertilizing eggs. Fertile types have been called \\"eusperm\\" or \\"eupyrene sperm\\" and infertile types \\"parasperm\\" or \\"apyrene sperm\\". One interpretation of sperm polymorphism is the \\"kamikaze sperm\\" hypothesis (Baker and Bellis, 1988), which has been widely discredited in humans. The kamikaze sperm hypothesis states that the polymorphism of sperm is due to a subdivision of sperm into different functional groups. There are those that defend the egg from fertilization by other male sperm, and those that fertilize the egg. However, there is no evidence that the polymorphism of human sperm is for the purpose of antagonizing rival sperm.Moore, H. D. M., M. Martin and T. R. Birkhead, ‚ÄòNo evidence for killer sperm or other selective interactions between human spermatozoa in ejaculates of different males in vitro‚Äô, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (1999), B, 266: 2343-2350  Distribution  Sperm heteromorphism is known from several different groups of animals. =Insects= *Lepidoptera (i.e. butterflies and moths): Almost all known species produce two sperm types. The fertilizing type has a longer tail and contains a nucleus. The other type is shorter and lacks a nucleus, meaning it contains no genetic information at all. *Drosophila (fruit-flies): the D. obscura group of species in the genus Drosophila is sperm heteromorphic. As with the Lepidoptera, there is a long, fertile type and a short, infertile type. However, the infertile type has a nucleus with a normal, haploid chromosome complement. It is not known why the shorter sperm are infertile, though it has been suggested that the slightly wider head of the infertile type might prevent it from entering the micropyle of the egg. *Diosidae (stalk-eyed flies): several species have a long, fertile type and a shorter infertile type. *Carabidae (ground beetles): some species produce large, infertile sperm that may contain up to 100 sets of chromosomes. =Molluscs= *Some prosobranch gastropods (snails) produce two or three sperm types. The infertile types may be large \\"carrier\\" types the fertile sperm attach to for transport, or \\"lancet\\" types. The lancet sperm sometimes contain many lysosomes. =Fish= *Some Sculpin may be sperm heteromorphic. Their ejaculates appear to contain fertile sperm as well as disc-shaped, infertile sperm. Possible functions of sperm heteromorphism =Non-adaptive= The non-fertilising morph(s) have no function, and are simply developmental errors. This is thought to be unlikely in many sperm heteromorphic species because the production of infertile sperm may be highly regulated, and infertile sperm can make up >90% of the total sperm in some Lepidoptera and Drosophila. =Provisioning= The non-fertilising morph(s) are a means in which males can provide nutrition to the female, her eggs or the fertilising sperm. =Facilitation= The non-fertilising sperm help the fertilising sperm by assisting their sexual transport or capacitation (i.e. the acquisition of fertilisation competence). This has been demonstrated in Bombyx mori. In silkworms, there is good evidence that fertile sperm are unable to fertilise if the non-fertile sperm are not present. The researchers artificially inseminated fertile sperm, non-fertile sperm or a mixture of both. Only the last group resulted in offspring production. =Sperm competition= Scanning electron microscopic image of immature parasperm lancet (infertile sperm morph) of Fusitriton oregonensis showing the tail brush still present, which later develops into part of the body of the parasperm. It is producing when sperm competition occurs. Non-fertile sperm increase the fertilisation success of the male producing them when sperm competition occurs. This might be offensive (e.g. displacing or even killing rival fertilising sperm) or defensive (e.g. by blocking areas of the female tract or creating a hostile pre-fertilisation environment). =\\"Cheap filler\\"= Non-fertile sperm delay or prevent the female mating again, thus allowing the male producing the non- fertile sperm a greater share of the paternity of her offspring (because the male avoids Sperm competition). For example, sperm might fill up the sperm storage organs so that female \\"perceives\\" that she does not need to re-mate to obtain more sperm. Alternatively, the sperm may transfer chemicals similar to sex peptide, a chemical carried on the sperm of Drosophila melanogaster that makes females less likely to accept mates (i.e. it is an anti- aphrodesiac).Cook, P.A., and Wedell, N. 1999. Non-fertile sperm delay female remating. Nature 397: 486. There is correlational evidence for this theory in a butterfly, Pieris napi. Females that were receptive to a second mating had fewer of the non-fertile sperm type in storage than did non-receptive females. Thus, the infertile sperm may be responsible for delaying female remating. This theory was also tested in the fruit-fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, but the results suggested that \\"cheap filler\\" was not important in that species.Swallow, J.G., and G.S. Wilkinson. 2002.

Not a statistician, Huff was a journalist who wrote many \\"how to\\" articles as a freelancer. The book is a brief, breezy illustrated volume outlining errors when it comes to the interpretation of statistics, and how these errors may create incorrect conclusions. In the 1960s and 1970s, it became a standard textbook introduction to the subject of statistics for many college students. It has become one of the best-selling statistics books in history, with over one and a half million copies sold in the English-language edition.\\"Over the last fifty years, How to Lie with Statistics has sold more copies than any other statistical text.\\" J.

Themes of the book include \\"Correlation does not imply causation\\" and \\"Using random sampling\\". It also shows how statistical graphs can be used to distort reality, for example by truncating the bottom of a line or bar chart, so that differences seem larger than they are, or by representing one-dimensional quantities on a pictogram by two- or three- dimensional objects to compare their sizes, so that the reader forgets that the images do not scale the same way the quantities do. The original edition contained illustrations by artist Irving Geis. In a UK edition, these were replaced with cartoons by Mel Calman.  Controversy  In the 1960s Huff was funded by the tobacco industry to produce a follow-up book titled How to Lie with Smoking Statistics that attempted to use statistical arguments to undermine claims that smoking was harmful to health. The book was never published but Huff has subsequently been criticised by statisticians for his involvement and the arguments advanced in draft copies.

The population of the civil parish was 5,169 at the 2001 census, increasing to 5,637 at the 2011 census. Geography River Slea south of the village near the A153 Ruskington is approximately to the north of Sleaford, from Newark and Grantham, and from Boston and Lincoln, with a flat landscape. The Spires and Steeples Trail passes north-south through the village, following the River Slea into Sleaford. The High Street is split into two parts, High Street North and High Street South, by The Beck, a brook that flows from Bloxholm west of the village before merging into the Slea at Haverholme Park. A large number of Mallard ducks inhabit the Beck and surrounding gardens. Roxholm is to the west of the civil parish, and the boundary passes south of Roxholm Grange. On the road to Dunsby it meets Brauncewell, passes eastward through Cottage Farm, crossing the road to Bloxholm, then crossing the B1188, Lincoln Road, north of the village, where it meets Dorrington, skirting the northern edge of the village. The border crosses the railway south of Cedar Farm (in Dorrington), then follows to the south of the road from Dorrington out onto the fens (Ruskington Fen). At Sylcote, it meets North Kyme, following Farroway Drain to the south at Ruskington Dales. It then follows Anwick Bank westward, where it meets Anwick to the south. At Highfield, it follows the Anwick road to the south, crossing the A153. North of Haverholme Priory (outside the parish), meeting Ewerby and Evedon at the River Slea, which it follows for over to the west, before meeting Leasingham.

Electro- Harmonix is a New York-based company that makes high-end electronic audio processors and sells rebranded vacuum tubes. The company was founded by Mike Matthews in 1968. It is best known for a series of popular guitar effects pedals introduced in the 1970s and 1990s. Unknown to most people, EH also made a line of guitars in the 70's. During the mid-1970s Electro-Harmonix established itself as a pioneer and leading manufacturer of guitar effects pedals. Electro-Harmonix was the first company to introduce, manufacture, and market affordable state-of-the art \\"stomp-boxes\\" for guitarist and bassists, such as the first stomp-box flanger (Electric Mistress), the first analog echo/delay unit with no moving parts (Memory Man), the first guitar synthesizer in pedal form (Micro Synthesizer), and the first tube-amp distortion simulator (Hot Tubes). In 1980, Electro-Harmonix also designed and marketed one of the first digital delay/looper pedals (16-Second Digital Delay) and a line of guitars in the 70's.  Company history  = Founding years (1967‚Äì1968) = Electro-Harmonix was founded by rhythm and blues keyboard player Mike Matthews in October 1968 in New York City with $1,000. He took a job as a salesman for IBM in 1967, but shortly afterwards, in partnership with Bill Berko, an audio repairman who claimed to have his own custom circuit for a fuzz pedal, he jobbed construction of the new pedal to a contracting house and began distributing the pedals under a deal with the Guild Guitar Company. Fuzzboxes were in demand following a trail of hits involving their sound, including \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" by The Rolling Stones two years before (the pedal's stomp switch can be clearly heard at 0:35 before Richards plays the song's trademark riff), and recent popularization of Jimi Hendrix. The latter connection resulted in the pedals being branded the 'Foxey Lady'. In addition several low priced models of acoustic guitars were sold. Following the departure of his partner, Matthews was introduced to inventor and electric engineer Robert Myer through IBM colleagues. Together they designed a circuit to create a distortion-free sustain. A simple line booster used by Myers in testing to preamplify the guitar's signal was also manufactured from 1969 as the Linear Power Booster (LPB-1), and has continued production in present day. =First products= The Axis fuzz pedal, also sold under the name 'Foxey Lady' for the Guild guitar company, and LPB-1 Linear Power Booster were the first products in 1969. The LPB-1 massively boosted a guitar signal & could be used to overdrive an amplifier, resulting in a raw distorted sound, full of sustain and harmonics. Several similar devices, which sold well, followed, such as the Treble Booster and Bass Booster. The Mike Matthews Freedom Amp, a portable guitar amp powered by 40 \\"D\\" batteries, was popular in many venues that lacked an A/C power source. = Change of direction = Electro-Harmonix Tubes (KT88) Electro- Harmonix stopped making pedals in the mid-1980s, and in the early 1990s started selling vacuum tubes re-branded with its name for guitar amplifiers, which it had also been making since the 1970s. However, due to demand and the high prices guitarists were paying for old 1970s pedals on the vintage market, it reissued the more popular old pedals in the mid-1990s, including the Big Muff Pi and Small Stone. In 2002 it started designing new pedals to add to its range. Company policy was that all reissued effects remained as close as possible to the original, vintage designs; however, casings, knobs and especially the old-fashioned mini-jack power plug were not up to later standards. In 2006 the smaller and more standardized \\"micro\\" and \\"nano\\" effect lines using surface-mount circuit components were introduced. Circuit board manufacture was outsourced, and the pedals assembled in New York.  Effects pedals  preamp. Electro-Harmonix produces pedals with many different types of sound manipulation suitable for guitar, bass, vocal, keyboard, and other instruments. It also sells rebranded vacuum tubes carrying the Electro- Harmonix brand name. = Big Muff = NYC & a Russian Sovtek re-issued versions In 1969 Bob Myer and Mike Matthews designed the Big Muff Pi, a fuzzbox that added a bass-heavy sustain to any guitar sound. It is described by the company as \\"the finest harmonic distortion-sustain device developed to date\\". Originally this was intended to be a pedal that would mimic the fuzz tones of Jimi Hendrix and other guitarists at the time, but the result was a mix of a fuzz and distortion pedal with a very heavy sound. It also made small amps sound much better and allowed distortion at any volume. The pedal sold well and was used by Carlos Santana, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Alex Lifeson of Rush and, later, Metallica's bassist Cliff Burton, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and in the 1990s KoRn's rhythm guitarist Munky, Vicente Freitas, Jack White of The White Stripes, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., The Edge of U2, and Billy Corgan (on The Smashing Pumpkins landmark album, Siamese Dream). The band Mudhoney titled their debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff. Although the first Big Muff production date was for many years cited as 1971, the first version of the Big Muff was actually sold in 1969 as a hand-made \\"perf board\\" version. A production version with an etched PCB board was made in early 1970. Mike Matthews was friends with Jimi Hendrix and claims Jimi bought one from Manny's Music in New York, shortly after they were released and had one in the Electric Lady Studios shortly before Jimi's death in 1970. Several variations of the Big Muff Pi followed throughout the 1970s. Electro-Harmonix produced a reissue assembled in New York City; until 2009 it produced a version made by Sovtek in Russia which provided a slightly different tone. The Bass Big Muff replaced the Russian version. Several other variations (some of which are not actually Big Muffs) of the pedal were in production , including the Metal Muff (intended to achieve the higher gain Metal guitar sound), the Double Muff, which incorporates the original Muff Fuzz circuit, twice in series with a single overdrive control for each circuit, providing the user either with a cascaded 'Double Muff' sound or the original Muff Fuzz circuit, the Little Big Muff, a smaller version, and a variation in circuit, of the NYC Big Muff, which produces yet another variation in sound, and the Big Muff with Tone Wicker, which is similar to the 2008 revision NYC Big Muff, with two added features: a tone bypass switch allowing you to bypass the tone control and a switch that adjusts the frequency of three high frequency filters in the circuit. The Germanium 4 Big Muff Pi is a dual unit, housing an overdrive and a distortion circuit featuring 2 Germanium transistors each, and simulating a dying battery with a Volt control, which characteristically affects the sound of the distortion. In 2018, Electro-Harmonix released three vintage Big Muff re-issues the Green Russian Big Muff, the Op-Amp Big Muff, and the Triangle Big Muff, and in early 2020 the Ram‚Äôs Head Big Muff was reissued. = Phasers, chorus and flanger = Small Clone chorus pedal Electro-Harmonix often produces a range of pedals based on a single effect, and then combines two or more into higher end units. For instance, the Epitome combines the MIcro POG, Stereo Electric Mistress, and Holy Grail Plus into one effect unit. The widely used Small Stone phase shifter is a 4-stage phaser designed by David Cockerell, whom Electro-Harmonix hired from his former employer EMS.Small Stone history The phased sounds of French composer Jean-Michel Jarre depended heavily on the Small Stone unit. It was reissued years later by EHX and a smaller version of the pedal was eventually introduced in a 'Nano' casing (officially called the \\"Small Stone (Nano Chassis)\\"). The Small Clone chorus is a very popular chorus pedal, used by Kurt Cobain, both live and in studio. Like the Small Stone, it is issued in both the standard size and two different smaller versions (the Nano Clone is based on the Clone Theory circuit, while the neo clone is the standard). The Electric Mistress is an analog flanger. It had first been sold in 1976 and was by that the first flanger in pedal format.History of the Electric Mistress The Deluxe version has been reissued and is still in production, although in 2015, a new Deluxe Electric Mistress was introduced in the company's smaller \\"XO\\" casing. As well, there are two digital recreations called NEO Mistress and Stereo Electric Mistress. Except for the very first blue/red version the Electric Mistress featured a \\"Filter Matrix mode\\" which allowed the user to freeze it at any point in the flange, offering distinctive chime-like tones. On the Neo and Stereo Mistress, this is achieved at a certain setting on the \\"rate\\" knob. Notable users include David Gilmour, Todd Rundgren, Alex Lifeson, Robin Trower, Andy Summers of The Police, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante. The Flanger Hoax pedal is a more advanced unit, allowing further control of the various parameters of phaser, flanger and chorusing effects. The Polychorus allows highly adjustable chorus, flanger, filter matrix, and slapback echo effects. Notable users include Cobain (i.e. \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\"), Adrian Belew, and more recently Ryan Jarman of The Cribs. Electro- Harmonix's 'XO' line added the Stereo Polyphase, an analog optical envelope- and LFO-controlled phase shifter. = Delays and loopers = Electro-Harmonix also manufactures delay pedals, including the Deluxe Memory Man, Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai, and #1 Echo. They also produce the '2880' pedal, which allows complex looping and multi-track overdubbing. The #1 Echo provides basic digital echo capability, while the Deluxe Memory Man provides more control over length, repeats, etc. The Deluxe Memory Man also includes built-in chorusing and vibrato effects. The digital Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai (distinct from the Analog Deluxe Memory Man) also includes reverse echo effect and looping/overdubbing. The Memory Toy and Memory Boy delay pedals are essentially smaller budget versions of the Deluxe Memory Man. The Memory Man effects pedal was used by Edge from the band U2 to record the songs \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". One of the singles from the band Deerhunter's 2010 album Halcyon Digest was named \\"Memory Boy\\". = Reverb = The Holy Grail, Holy Grail Plus, Holier Grail (discontinued), Holiest Grail (discontinued), Oceans 11, and Cathedral pedals produce reverberation. These cover a range of capability, including reverb length, room simulation, etc. The company's Holy Stain multi-effects pedal also includes two different types of reverb. = Tremolo and Vibrato = Tremolo and vibrato are included as well, in both solid-state and vacuum tube options. These are available in the Stereo Pulsar (solid-state) and Wiggler (tube) pedals. = Octave, pitch and synthesizer = Also available are a series of pitch modulation pedals. These include the Micro Synthesizer (for bass or guitar), HOG (Harmonic Octave Generator), POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator, released in 2005), POG 2 (2009), Micro POG (in an XO casing), Nano POG, Octave Multiplexer, and Pitch Fork. The POG line of pedals has been used extensively by several prominent 2000s-era rock guitarists, including Jack White (of The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, etc.), and Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures, etc.). = Envelope, EQ and compression = Electro-Harmonix offers several pedals for envelope/equalization modulation. Amongst them are the Bassballs (appropriately named for its intended use with bass guitars), Doctor Q and the Q-Tron. Another pedal of note was the vacuum tube-powered Black Finger Compressor which adds distortion-free sustain to the sound and which appeared in the mid 1970s. The solid-state White Finger followed. In 1995, Electro- Harmonix owner Mike Matthews commissioned Mike Beigel, former owner of Musitronics Corp. and inventor of the Mu-tron III envelope filter, to design a new envelope filter using the same analog circuitry as the original Mu-tron III, thus keeping the sound as close to the original as possible while adding new features to bring the effect into the new millennium. The pedal featured the same controls as the Mu-tron III and incorporated a \\"Boost\\" feature, which activates an internal pre-amp and changes the function of the gain knob giving the Q-Tron a sound almost identical to the Mu-tron III. Another feature added to Q-Tron was an effects loop switch and attack response switch. Units with these features are called the Q-Tron+. A smaller more compact version, the Mini Q-Tron, is also available, as well as an even smaller version, the Micro Q-Tron. Electro-Harmonix also currently produces a modulated envelope filter, the Blurst = Other pedals = Electro-Harmonix currently manufactures over one hundred other pedals. These include the Graphic Fuzz (a fuzzbox which includes an EQ section), the Frequency Analyzer (which creates ring modulation) and the Voice Box, a vocoder. The Voice Box has been included in a series of demonstration videos produced by Jack Conte. Electro-Harmonix has also made a few small power amp pedals for use as a simple guitar amplifier. The EHX 22 Caliber was a 22 watt solid state pedal capable of driving either an 8 ohm or 16 ohm speaker cabinet. It has been discontinued. The 22 Caliber was replaced in the lineup by the EHX 44 Magnum, a similar pedal capable of driving the same speaker load, but at a 44 watt output. Several pedals produced in the decades prior have also been discontinued, many of which are still in high demand for their unique sound. = Acoustic guitars = These guitars were only available from EH for a very short time in 1974. They were available through a special offer for $87.50 with the purchase of $50 or more in certain scratch-n-dent EH products. The list price was $187.50. They didn't buy out a warehouse and put their name on them. These are the model names and descriptions: EH-7010 EH acoustic guitar (mahogany back and sides), EH-7020 EH acoustic guitar (D-28 copy, rosewood back and sides), and EH-7030 EH acoustic guitar (D-41 copy, rosewood back and sides, pearloid binding and inlay, 3 piece back). They bought them from Moridaira/ Morris Guitar who at the time were the best guitar maker in Japan, making guitars for Fender and many big companies. They put the EH on the guitars. The guitar, marked with the brand \\"Brody\\" is another Japanese-made acoustic that EH had made for them in the 70's. Mike Matthews has stated that Brody was his mother's maiden name. Unlike the other EH guitar, this one is of a lesser quality.

After the disappearance of her half-brother, the caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, in 1021, she was instrumental in securing the succession of her nephew Ali az-Zahir, and acted as the de facto ruler of the state until her death on 5 February 1023. Family and early life She was born in September/October 970 at the palace- city of al-Mansuriya in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia), to the prince Nizar‚Äîthe future fifth Fatimid imam‚Äìcaliph, al-Aziz Billah (). Her mother was an unnamed concubine (umm walad), who is most likely to be identified with the al-Sayyida al-Aziziyya (\\"the Lady of al-Aziz\\") frequently mentioned in the sources. Al- Sayyida al-Aziziyya was a Melkite Christian, most likely of Byzantine Greek origin, possibly from a family of the provincial aristocracy of Sicily who were captured in the wars against the Byzantines there sometime before 965. It is known that al-Sayyida al-Aziziyya refused to convert to Islam. Al-Aziz's love for her was great, but scandalized pious Muslim opinion, especially at a time when al-Aziz was at war with the Byzantines in Syria. Her Christian faith reportedly caused suspicion that she was behind his tolerance towards Christians and Jews, which went as far as the appointment of a Christian, Isa ibn Nasturus, as vizier. In 986, two of her brothers were appointed to high office in the Melkite Church: Orestes became Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Arsenios was made metropolitan bishop of Fustat, and later Patriarch of Alexandria. It is still debated among modern scholars whether al-Sayyida al- Aziziyya was also the mother of Sitt al-Mulk's younger brother, and al-Aziz's heir and successor, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (), but the evidence appears to be against it. When her mother died in November 995, the historian al-Maqrizi reports, Sitt al-Mulk held vigil at her tomb for one month. From her mother the princess inherited a slave girl, Taqarrub, who became her chief confidante and spy in the palace. One year before the birth of Sitt al-Mulk, the Fatimid armies had conquered Egypt. In 972‚Äì973, the Fatimid court moved from Ifriqiya to Egypt to take up residence in their newly built capital, Cairo. Thus Sitt al-Mulk spent her childhood at the palace of Qasr al-Bahr on the shores of the Nile, and later had her own rooms in the Western Palace at Cairo. Sitt al-Mulk was doted on by her father, and was his favourite daughter. Al-Aziz lavished gifts and wealth on her, and even put a military unit at her disposal. Her wealth allowed her to fund a number of charitable endowments. She was renowned for her beauty, but, following common Fatimid practice, she remained unmarried to avoid dynastic complications. Sitt al-Mulk inherited her father's open- mindedness and tolerance, and, uniquely among Fatimid palace ladies, appears to have been involved in politics. She exercised not a little influence on him during his reign, as seen by the attempt of the Christian vizier Isa ibn Nasturus, when he was dismissed from his post, to regain his post through her intercession (for which he placed 300,000 dinars at her disposal). Reign of al-Hakim Caliph al-Aziz died suddenly at Bilbays on 13 October 996, while preparing an expedition against the Byzantines in northern Syria. His sudden death opened the issue of succession, as the caliph's only surviving son, al- Mansur, was eleven years old. His half-sister Sitt al-Mulk therefore supported another candidate, an adult son of the prince Abdallah, who had been the first designated heir to Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah () but had died shortly before him, leading to the accession of al-Aziz. According to the Arab chroniclers, she had fallen in love with this otherwise unknown cousin and intended to marry him. The princess reportedly hurried back to Cairo with the senior courtiers and the palace guard to take control of the palace and raise her candidate to the throne, but the eunuch Barjawan, who was al-Mansur's tutor, pre-empted her by putting the crown on the boy's head as soon as news of al-Aziz's death arrived. Al-Mansur thus became caliph with the regnal name of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, while Sitt al-Mulk was placed under house arrest. Nevertheless, although not much information survives, during the early part of al-Hakim's reign, the relations between Sitt al-Mulk and her brother appear to have been normal and even amicable: in 997, she made him rich gifts, and soon after Barjawan's murder in 1000, which allowed al-Hakim to take over the reins of government himself, he conferred estates with an annual income of 100,000 gold dinars on her. In 1000, al-Hakim even married one of her slave girls. In at least one instance she also intervened to inform her brother, who was rather ignorant of state affairs, of a conspiracy by two senior officials that led to the execution of the vizier Abu'l-Ala Fahd ibn Ibrahim, followed by the extortion of vast sums from tax officials in Palestine. In 1013, she mediated with her brother for a pardon to the Jarrahid chieftain al-Hasan ibn Mufarrij, who had previously risen in revolt against Fatimid rule in Palestine along with his father, Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah. Soon, however, al-Hakim's reign began to degenerate into terror and arbitrary rule. The state suffered from an increasingly erratic governance, as the Caliph issued a bewildering array of prohibitions ranging from food and singing in public to dogs and baths, launched a persecution of Christians and Jews (culminating in the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009), purged the old guard of officials he had inherited from his father, and introduced doctrinal innovations, even to the point of seemingly accepting the divine status accorded to him by some of the Isma'ili faithful (who would later found the Druze sect). As a result, the two siblings drifted apart. The princess opposed al-Hakim's intolerant politics, and he was jealous of her, suspecting her of having lovers, including among his generals. The event that most contributed to the rift between the two was connected to the succession: in 1013, al-Hakim chose a cousin, Abd al-Rahman ibn Ilyas, as the designated heir apparent (walƒ´  øahd al-muslimƒ´n), violating the direct line of succession and overturning a century of precedent of excluding the males of the wider dynasty from all affairs of state. Sitt al-Mulk was committed to the succession of al-Hakim's surviving son Ali, and took him and his mother, the umm walad Ruqayya, into her palace to shield them from the Caliph. The downfall of al-Hakim's erstwhile favourite Malik ibn Sa'id al-Fariqi in 1014/5 is apparently related to this: Malik, who had been raised to head both the judiciary, as chief qƒÅ·∏çƒ´, and of the Isma'ili da øwa, as chief dƒÅ øƒ´, was accused of being close to her (apparently siding with her over the choice of heir), and was executed. On the night of 13 February 1021, the Caliph disappeared during one of his nightly walks in the streets of Cairo. After a couple of days of search, evidence of his murder was found, and he was declared dead. Of the three contemporary historians to write about these events (and who in turn provided the material for many later historians), the account of the Baghdadi chronicler Hilal al- Sabi directly implicates the princess, writing that after Sitt al-Mulk quarreled with her brother over the direction of the state and the future of the dynasty, she began to fear that he would have her killed. She thus approached the Kutama general Ibn Dawwas, whom the Caliph suspected of being one of her lovers, and conspired with him to have al-Hakim killed, which was done by Ibn Dawwas' slaves. Given the fervently anti-Fatimid bias of Hilal, this account is suspect, but the later historians Sibt ibn al-Jawzi and Ibn Taghribirdi, apparently relying on the second contemporary account, that of the Egyptian Shafi'i qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ al-Quda'i, report that she ordered the execution of all those who participated in the conspiracy to kill al-Hakim. This has been interpreted by modern historians as an attempt to cover up her involvement. On the other hand, Yahya of Antioch, a Christian who had fled al-Hakim's persecution, mentions nothing of Sitt al-Mulk's involvement in al-Hakim's death. Modern scholars are likely divided, with some, such as Yaacov Lev and Fatema Mernissi, considering her participation as probable, and others, such as Heinz Halm, considering it dubious, since there were many other members of the Fatimid establishment, including Ibn Dawwas, who had an interest in eliminating the erratic caliph. Even Halm admits, however, that the rumours were persistent, and that, as the affair around Malik al-Fariqi shows, al- Hakim did not trust his sister. Regency Following the disappearance of al- Hakim, and even before he was declared dead, Sitt al-Mulk moved to establish her control of the court, distributing money to the court dignitaries and military commanders (according to Hilal, with the aid of Ibn Dawwas). Hilal reports that al-Hakim's son Ali was raised to the throne, with the regnal name al-Zahir li-i'zaz Din Allah, only seven days after al-Hakim's disappearance, but all other sources mention that he was crowned on 27 March, with Sitt al- Mulk as the de facto ruler of the state in the meantime. All sources agree that she quickly had Ibn Dawwas executed as the one responsible for al-Hakim's death (and perhaps to cover up her own culpability). This was followed soon after by al-Hakim's designated heir, Abd al-Rahman ibn Ilyas, who was then serving as governor of Damascus: he was lured back to Egypt, imprisoned, and killed. The new caliph had long been under her tutelage during al-Hakim's reign, and remained so for some time after his coronation, which led to tensions with al-Zahir's mother, Ruqayya. During this early period of al- Zahir's reign, Sitt al-Mulk was the effective governor of the state, known in contemporary sources as \\"the Princess-Aunt\\" (al-Sayyida al- øAmma) or \\"the Princess Aziz\\" (al-Sayyida al- øAzƒ´za). In this capacity, she began to reverse al-Hakim's decisions, and restore orderly government, with a particular attention to the state finances: among other measures, she cancelled the estate grants and salaries that al-Hakim had conferred on his favourites, and restored the customs duties that he had abolished for being un-Islamic. She also reversed her brother's manifold prohibitions, allowing women to leave their homes, and permitting again the listening to music and the drinking of wine. The non-Muslims (dhimmƒ´s) who had been forced to convert to Islam under al-Hakim were allowed to return to their old faith, and those who had fled the country were allowed to return. Historian Yaacov Lev points out that she was able to do so as the result of several factors. On the one hand, while women of the Fatimid dynasty were not usually involved in politics, they were \\"not secluded from social and economic life\\", which not only allowed them contact with the world outside the palace, but even necessitated the supervision of the administrative and financial agents acting on their behalf, giving them some experience in such matters. Finally, particularly after the chaos and terror of al-Hakim's last years, the ruling elite was quite prepared to accept direction from her, for they had little left to lose. As Lev writes, in this atmosphere, \\"machinations and the readiness to shed blood had become accepted ways of conducting political life, and by these standards, Sitt al-Mulk was a ruler worthy of the name, for she inspired hayba [i.e., awe]\\". However, while she was widely praised by medieval chroniclers for both her personal qualities as well as for her sound policies, her position was anomalous, and dependent on the entirely exceptional circumstances. She may have de facto exercised the functions of a caliph, but it was unthinkable for her to hold power in her own name and claim sovereignty, for example by having her name included in the khu·π≠ba. It is unclear how long her regency lasted; the contemporary official and historian al-Musabbihi indicates that power soon passed to a new circle of officials, and that she lost her influence and died in obscurity, while al- Maqrizi indicates that she maintained her control over state affairs until her death. She also severely persecuted the Druze religion, which believed in al- Hakim's divinity. She succeeded in eliminating it entirely from Egypt, and restricting it to the mountains of Lebanon. She also worked to reduce tensions with the Byzantine Empire over the possession of Aleppo, but before negotiations could be completed, Sitt al-Mulk died of dysentery on 5 February 1023 at the age of fifty-two.

Interpretation In lines AP and AQ, in the phrase \\"gaf j\\" (\\"gave j\\"), the j-rune may be an ideogram standing for its rune name jara, meaning \\"harvest\\" or \\"bountiful or fruitful year.\\"MacLeod (2006:112-113). One author suggests that line AQ is describing an animal sacrifice in return for a good harvest as part of a fertility ritual.Looijenga (2003:29, 182). History The Stentoften runestone was discovered in 1823 by the dean O. Hammer. It was lying down with the inscription facing downwards, surrounded by five sharp larger stones forming a pentagon or a pentagram. Consequently, the stone has been part of a larger monument like the Bj√∂rketorp Runestone further east. In 1864, the runestone was moved into the church of S√∂lvesborg. Most scholars date the inscription to the 7th century and it is carved with a type of runes that form an intermediate version between the Elder Futhark and the Younger Futhark. A characteristic example of this is the a-rune 10px which has the same form as the h-rune of the younger futhark. This is the rune that is transliterated with A. The k-rune, which looks like a Y is a transition form between 10px and 7px in the two futharks. There are quite few intermediary inscriptions like this one. Three more are known from Blekinge, i.e. the Bj√∂rketorp Runestone, the Istaby Runestone and the Gummarp Runestone, which were moved to Copenhagen and lost in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. The Stentoften, Istaby Runestone and Gummarp Runestone inscriptions can be identified with the same clan through the names that are mentioned on them,Looijenga (2003:188). and the names are typical for chieftains. The Bj√∂rketorp Runestone lacks names and is raised some tens of kilometers from the others. However, it is beyond doubt that the Bj√∂rketorp runestone is connected to them, because in addition to the special runic forms, the same message is given on the Stentoften Runestone. These runestones are probably not carved by the same person, and so it appears that they reflect a specific runic tradition in the Blekinge area during the 7th century. Runologist Michael Schulte suggests that the archaic text of the Stentoften stone is more effective from a dramatic perspective than the younger and more explicit version on the Bj√∂rketorp stone.Schulte 2008:17-18. The name Hariwulfa is a combination of hari meaning \\"warrior\\" and wulafa \\"wolf,\\" while the ha√æu of Ha√æuwulfz means \\"battle.\\"Looijenga (2003:181). It has been suggested that the assignment of such lycophoric names may have been related to ritualistic practices and religious wolf-symbolism used in the initiation of young warriors.Gr√§slund (2006:125). A shortened form of the name Hariwulfa survived into the Viking Age and is attested in the inscription on the H√¶rulf Runestone.Sundqvist & Hultg√•rd (2004:585).

Her recordings were inducted into the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register in 2017. Although there has been dispute as to whether she or Truganini was the last full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal, Smith was officially recognised as the last Tasmanian Aboriginal by the Government in 1889. Early life Fanny Cochrane's mother Tanganutura and a man named Nicremeric or Nicermenic, sometimes reported as her father, were two of the Tasmanian Aboriginals settled on Flinders Island in the 1830s by George Augustus Robinson; according to Tindale her father was Cottrel Cochrane, of European descent, and Nicremeric was her stepfather. She was born at Settlement Point (or Wybalenna, meaning Black Man's House) on Flinders Island. No indigenous name is known; Robinson gave European names to all the Indigenous Tasmanians who arrived at the Island as part of his attempt to suppress their culture. From the age of five to eight she lived in the home of Robert Clark, the Wybalenna preacher, and was then sent to the orphan school in Hobart to learn domestic service skills, after which she returned to Wybalenna. She served as Clark's servant until the station closed in 1847. In 1847 her parents, along with the survivors of Wybalenna, were removed to Oyster Cove. Note that there is no evidence that Nicermenic was her father or that he was on Flinders Island in the 1830s.Van Diemen's Land: An Aboriginal History p300 In June 1834, the year of Fanny's birth on Flinders Island, he was reported to Robinson as being involved in stealing a boat on the Leven River on the NW Coast with Probelatter.FM p. 893 Family In 1854, Fanny married William Smith, an English sawyer and ex-convict, and between 1855 and 1880 they had 11 children. Following her marriage, Fanny and her husband ran a boarding-house in Hobart. After receiving a government annuity of ¬£24 and a land grant of , she selected land near Oyster Cove to be near her mother, sister and brother and the couple moved there shortly before their first child was born. The Smiths grew their own food but derived their income from timber. Final years Following the death of Truganini in 1876, Fanny laid claim to be \\"the last Tasmanian\\". While there was some dispute as to whether she or Truganini was the last Tasmanian Aboriginal person, the government of the Colony of Tasmania recognised her claim in 1889 and granted her of land and increased her annuity to ¬£50. She became a Methodist and gave the land needed to build a Methodist church at Nicholls Rivulet, which opened in 1901. Cochrane Smith died of pneumonia and pleurisy at Port Cygnet, from Oyster Cove, on 24 February 1905. In 1898, Henry Ling Roth published a paper in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute examining Smith's claim to be a \\"full- blood\\" Aboriginal Tasmanian. He did not examine her personally, but compared locks of her hair with samples of earlier Tasmanians, and conducted a photographic comparison of her and Truganini. Roth concluded that Smith was actually mixed-race, as she had \\"Europeanised\\" facial characteristics, much lighter skin than Truganini, and hair that was \\"wavy\\" rather than \\"woolly\\". Legacy 1903 recording Smith is known for her wax cylinder recordings of Aboriginal songs, made in 1903, which constitute the only audio recordings of an indigenous Tasmanian language. Five cylinders were cut; however, when it was 1949, only four remained as \\"A fifth cylinder, on which was recorded the translation of the songs, was broken some time ago\\". Upon hearing her own performance, Smith had cried \\"My poor race. What have I done\\"; she believed the voice to be that of her mother. The recording of Smith's songs was the subject of a 1998 song by Australian folk singer Bruce Watson, The Man and the Woman and the Edison Phonograph. Watson is the great-grandson of Horace Watson, who recorded Fanny in 1903.Musicological Society of Australia A photograph of Fanny Cochrane Smith and Horace Watson is displayed in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.

The 426 m (1,398 ft) long tunnel was a technical sensation; 24 m (80 ft) beneath the surface, two 6 m (20 ft) diameter tubes connect central Hamburg with the docks and shipyards on the south side of the river Elbe. This was a big improvement for tens of thousands of workers in one of the busiest harbors in the world. Four large lifts on either side of the tunnel carry pedestrians and vehicles to the bottom. The two tunnels are both still in operation, though due to their limited capacity by today's standards, other bridges and tunnels have been built and taken over most of the traffic. In 2008 approximately 300,000 cars, 63,000 bicycles, and 700,000 pedestrians used the tunnel. The tunnel is opened 24 hours for pedestrians and bicycles. For motorized vehicles, opening times are currently Monday to Friday from 5:20 AM to 8:00 PM and on Saturdays from 5:20 AM to 4:00 PM. History On 22 July 1907 the construction, undertaken by Philipp Holzmann,Gro√ü, p. 50 started to connect the quarters of St. Pauli near the Landungsbr√ºcken and Steinwerder. Work was done under pressure because the tunnel was below the water table of the Elbe. This type of building technique was used in the 19th century, in large engineering excavations, such as with the piers of bridges and with tunnels, where caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding the excavations, such as the foundations of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. Workers who spend time in high-pressure atmospheric pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson without slowly reducing the surrounding pressure. Due to the problems associated with decompression sickness, many of the men working on the Elbe tunnel were affected by what was known at the time as \\"Caissons Disease\\". Of 4,400 workers three men died, 74 suffered severe cases and more than 600 came down with light symptoms. The tunnel opened on 7 September 1911. Modern usage In the tunnel an art exhibitionElbArt and a long-distance running event Elbtunnel- Marathonwebsite of the organiser take place.Runter in die R√∂hre (Down into the tube) Hamburger Abendblatt Retrieved July 31, 2008 In 2008 the tunnel participated in the Tag des offenen Denkmals (\\"Day of the open heritage site\\"), a Germany-wide annual event sponsored by the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz that opens cultural heritage sites to the public. Media The old tunnel has featured in several films including The Odessa File, Matchless, $, The American Friend (Der Amerikanische Freund) and Secret Agent Fireball. The tunnel was also featured in the music video for \\"One (Always Hardcore)\\" by German band Scooter.

The real and the pseudo wavefunction and potentials match above a certain cutoff radius r_c. In physics, a pseudopotential or effective potential is used as an approximation for the simplified description of complex systems. Applications include atomic physics and neutron scattering. The pseudopotential approximation was first introduced by Hans Hellmann in 1934.  Atomic physics  The pseudopotential is an attempt to replace the complicated effects of the motion of the core (i.e. non-valence) electrons of an atom and its nucleus with an effective potential, or pseudopotential, so that the Schr√∂dinger equation contains a modified effective potential term instead of the Coulombic potential term for core electrons normally found in the Schr√∂dinger equation. The pseudopotential is an effective potential constructed to replace the atomic all-electron potential (full-potential) such that core states are eliminated and the valence electrons are described by pseudo-wavefunctions with significantly fewer nodes. This allows the pseudo-wavefunctions to be described with far fewer Fourier modes, thus making plane-wave basis sets practical to use. In this approach usually only the chemically active valence electrons are dealt with explicitly, while the core electrons are 'frozen', being considered together with the nuclei as rigid non-polarizable ion cores. It is possible to self-consistently update the pseudopotential with the chemical environment that it is embedded in, having the effect of relaxing the frozen core approximation, although this is rarely done. In codes using local basis functions, like Gaussian, often effective core potentials are used that only freeze the core electrons. First-principles pseudopotentials are derived from an atomic reference state, requiring that the pseudo- and all-electron valence eigenstates have the same energies and amplitude (and thus density) outside a chosen core cut-off radius r_c. Pseudopotentials with larger cut-off radius are said to be softer, that is more rapidly convergent, but at the same time less transferable, that is less accurate to reproduce realistic features in different environments. Motivation: # Reduction of basis set size # Reduction of number of electrons # Inclusion of relativistic and other effects Approximations: # One-electron picture. # The small-core approximation assumes that there is no significant overlap between core and valence wave-function. Nonlinear core corrections or \\"semicore\\" electron inclusion deal with situations where overlap is non-negligible. Early applications of pseudopotentials to atoms and solids based on attempts to fit atomic spectra achieved only limited success. Solid-state pseudopotentials achieved their present popularity largely because of the successful fits by Walter Harrison to the nearly free electron Fermi surface of aluminum (1958) and by James C. Phillips to the covalent energy gaps of silicon and germanium (1958). Phillips and coworkers (notably Marvin L. Cohen and coworkers) later extended this work to many other semiconductors, in what they called \\"semiempirical pseudopotentials\\".M. L. Cohen, J. R. Chelikowsky, \\"Electronic Structure and Optical Spectra of Semiconductors\\", (Springer Verlag, Berlin 1988) = Norm- conserving pseudopotential = Norm-conserving and ultrasoft are the two most common forms of pseudopotential used in modern plane-wave electronic structure codes. They allow a basis-set with a significantly lower cut-off (the frequency of the highest Fourier mode) to be used to describe the electron wavefunctions and so allow proper numerical convergence with reasonable computing resources. An alternative would be to augment the basis set around nuclei with atomic-like functions, as is done in LAPW. Norm-conserving pseudopotential was first proposed by Hamann, Schl√ºter, and Chiang (HSC) in 1979. The original HSC norm-conserving pseudopotential takes the following form: :\\\\hat{V}_{\\\\textit{ps}}(r) = \\\\sum_l \\\\sum_m  Y_{lm} \\\\rangle V_{lm}(r) \\\\langle Y_{lm}  where Y_{lm}\\\\rangle projects a one-particle wavefunction, such as one Kohn-Sham orbital, to the angular momentum labeled by \\\\\\\\{l,m\\\\\\\\}. V_{lm}(r) is the pseudopotential that acts on the projected component. Different angular momentum states then feel different potentials, thus the HSC norm-conserving pseudopotential is non-local, in contrast to local pseudopotential which acts on all one-particle wave-functions in the same way. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials are constructed to enforce two conditions. 1\\\\. Inside the cut-off radius r_c, the norm of each pseudo-wavefunction be identical to its corresponding all-electron wavefunction: :\\\\int_{r, :where \\\\phi_{\\\\mathbf{R},i} and \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}_{\\\\mathbf{R},i} are the all-electron and pseudo reference states for the pseudopotential on atom \\\\mathbf{R}. 2\\\\. All- electron and pseudo wavefunctions are identical outside cut-off radius r_c. = Ultrasoft pseudopotentials = Ultrasoft pseudopotentials relax the norm- conserving constraint to reduce the necessary basis-set size further at the expense of introducing a generalized eigenvalue problem. With a non-zero difference in norms we can now define: :q_{\\\\mathbf{R},ij} = \\\\langle \\\\phi_{\\\\mathbf{R},i}  \\\\phi_{\\\\mathbf{R},j} \\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}_{\\\\mathbf{R},i}  \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}_{\\\\mathbf{R},j} \\\\rangle, and so a normalised eigenstate of the pseudo Hamiltonian now obeys the generalized equation :\\\\hat{H}  \\\\Psi_i \\\\rangle = \\\\epsilon_i \\\\hat{S}  \\\\Psi_i \\\\rangle, where the operator \\\\hat{S} is defined as :\\\\hat{S} = 1 + \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{R},i,j}  p_{\\\\mathbf{R},i} \\\\rangle q_{\\\\mathbf{R},ij} \\\\langle p_{\\\\mathbf{R},j} , where p_{\\\\mathbf{R},i} are projectors that form a dual basis with the pseudo reference states inside the cut-off radius, and are zero outside: :\\\\langle p_{\\\\mathbf{R},i}  \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}_{\\\\mathbf{R},j} \\\\rangle_{r. A related technique is the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.  Fermi pseudopotential  Enrico Fermi introduced a pseudopotential, V, to describe the scattering of a free neutron by a nucleus. The scattering is assumed to be s-wave scattering, and therefore spherically symmetric. Therefore, the potential is given as a function of radius, r: :V(r)=\\\\frac{4\\\\pi\\\\hbar^2}{m}b\\\\,\\\\delta(r), where \\\\hbar is the Planck constant divided by 2\\\\pi, m is the mass, \\\\delta(r) is the Dirac delta function, b is the bound coherent neutron scattering length, and r=0 the center of mass of the nucleus.Squires, Introduction to the Theory of Thermal Neutron Scattering, Dover Publications (1996) The Fourier transform of this \\\\delta-function leads to the constant neutron form factor. Phillips pseudopotential James Charles Phillips developed a simplified pseudopotential while at Bell Labs useful for describing silicon and germanium.

According to him, The Bracari women warriors fought defending their town \\"never turning, never never showing their backs, or uttering a cry,\\" preferring death to captivity. It has long been known that they spoke a Celtic language, as can be seen in the inscription dedicated to the goddess Nabia at Braga's Fonte do √çdolo (Portuguese for the Fountain of the Idol), or in the name of their town Tongobriga (in Marco de Canaveses).

Baffert (born January 13, 1953) is an American racehorse trainer who trained the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah and 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. Baffert's horses have won six Kentucky Derbies, seven Preakness Stakes, three Belmont Stakes and three Kentucky Oaks. He tied the record for most Kentucky Derby wins by a horse trainer with Authentic's win at the 2020 Derby. Early life and career Baffert grew up on a ranch in Nogales, Arizona, where his family raised cattle and chickens. When he was 10, his father purchased some Quarter Horses and he practiced racing them on a dirt track. In his teens, he worked as a jockey for $100 a day in informal Quarter Horse races on the outskirts of Nogales. He moved from there to racing at legalized tracks, scoring his first victory at age 17 in 1970. Baffert graduated from the University of Arizona's Race Track Industry Program with a Bachelor of Science degree, got married, and began training quarter horses at a Prescott, Arizona farm. By age 20, he had developed a reputation as a trainer and was hired by other trainers to run their stables. In the 1980s, Baffert moved to California and worked at Los Alamitos Race Course, where he switched to training Thoroughbreds. He got his first big break in 1992 when he won his first Breeder's Cup race with Thirty Slews. He became the leading money-winning trainer in the United States four times. American classic history Baffert's history in the American classic races began in 1996 when he trained a three-year-old colt named Cavonnier, who ran second in the Kentucky Derby. In 1997, he trained the gray colt Silver Charm to win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, finishing second in the Belmont. Baffert revisited the Derby the next year, sending two top colts, Real Quiet and Indian Charlie, to Louisville. Real Quiet won the race that year, but Baffert also finished third with Indian Charlie. Real Quiet won the Preakness as well, but, like Silver Charm, the horse was denied a Triple Crown win and finished second in the Belmont Stakes by a nose. Baffert, however, became the first trainer in history to win the Derby and Preakness in back-to-back years. Baffert did not win another classic race until 2001, when he swept the Preakness and Belmont Stakes with eventual Hall of Fame member Point Given. Although he was denied a Derby win that year, he finished third in the race with Congaree. Baffert won the Derby a third time the following year with War Emblem. The colt went on to win the Preakness Stakes, giving the trainer his third shot at winning the Triple Crown. The colt lost the Belmont Stakes after breaking poorly from the starting gate. Baffert did not have a horse hit the board again in any of the Triple Crown races until 2009, when he trained Pioneerof The Nile to a second-place finish in the Derby. Finally, after waiting eight years, Baffert trained Lookin At Lucky, co-owned by longtime client and good friend Mike Pegram, to win the Preakness Stakes in 2010. The colt skipped the Belmont Stakes but became the champion three-year-old colt that year. In 2012, Baffert saddled Bodemeister, named for the trainer's youngest son, Bode, to second-place finishes in the Derby and Preakness. He saddled Paynter in the Belmont Stakes later that year, but that colt, like his stablemate Bodemeister, finished second. In 2015, Baffert trained the 2014 champion two-year-old colt American Pharoah to win the Triple Crown, the first to do so in 37 years. He won the 141st Kentucky Derby, bringing his total number of victories in the race to four; Baffert also ran the third-place finisher, the previously undefeated colt Dortmund. American Pharoah next won the 140th Preakness Stakes, making six victories in that race for Baffert, who also finished fourth with Dortmund. Then, when American Pharoah won the 2015 Belmont Stakes, the win was the fourth attempt at a Triple Crown for Baffert, who at age 62 became the second-oldest trainer to win a Triple Crown. Baffert also trained the 2018 Triple Crown Winner, Justify and the 2020 Kentucky Derby winner, Authentic. Accomplishments Between 1997 and 1999 he won the Eclipse Award as outstanding trainer three years running and was voted the 1997 Big Sport of Turfdom Award. Baffert has trained horses that won fifteen American Classic Races, fifteen Breeders' Cup races, three Dubai World Cups and the inaugural Pegasus World Cup. In 2010 Baffert scored a first when Misremembered, a horse he bred, owned by his wife Jill and their friend George Jacobs, won the Santa Anita Handicap, marking Baffert's first Grade I win as a breeder. He also has nine wins in the Santa Anita Derby, nine in the Haskell Invitational Handicap, and fourteen wins in the Del Mar Futurity, a race he won seven straight times from 1996 to 2002, when run as a Grade II event. He also won the race in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 when run as a Grade I event. He has won the Kentucky Oaks three times: first in 1999 with Silverbulletday, who was later selected for the Hall of Fame, then with Plum Pretty in 2011 and lastly with Abel Tasman in 2017. Following Authentic's win the 2020 Kentucky Derby, Baffert tied the record for most Kentucky Derby wins at six.https://www.wcvb.com/article/2020-kentucky-derby-unlike-any- other/33932726 Only Ben Jones, who won Kentucky Derbies between 1938 and 1952, would also score six Kentucky Derby wins as a horse trainer. Clients Baffert has trained for numerous owners including The Thoroughbred Corporation (Prince Ahmed bin Salman), Golden Eagle Farm (John C. Mabee), the late Bob Lewis and his wife Beverly, Robert and Janice McNair, for whom he trained champions Chilukki and five-time Grade I winner Congaree, and his good friend Mike Pegram, for whom he has trained champions Real Quiet, Silverbulletday, Captain Steve, Midnight Lute, and Lookin At Lucky. In 2014, Baffert teamed with owner Kaleem Shah to win his first Breeders' Cup Classic with Bayern. Most recently, Baffert has trained horses for Zayat Stables, including Pioneerof The Nile, Zensational, Bodemeister, Paynter, and American Pharoah, and for Juddmonte Farms, most notably Arrogate. Hall of Fame Baffert in California Baffert was inducted into Lone Star Park's Hall of Fame in 2007, and in 2009, he was nominated and inducted to the National Museum of Racing's Hall of Fame. Baffert was elected alongside one of the best fillies he trained, Silverbulletday.Press Release Racing Museum April 20, 2009 Point Given was nominated in 2009, but elected and inducted in 2010. Personal life Baffert has five children: four from his first marriage to wife Sherry: Taylor, Canyon, Forest, and Savannah. He married his second wife, Jill, a former television reporter based in Louisville, in 2002. They had a son in 2004 they named \\"Bode\\" ( ), after skier Bode Miller. Baffert and his family reside in California. He appeared in an episode of the TV show Take Home Chef. Bob survived a heart attack in late March 2012 while in Dubai for a world- class race at Meydan. Following the 2015 Belmont win, Baffert outlined several charities that he and his wife Jill supported. He had been paid $200,000 to allow The Burger King to stand behind him in the grandstand during the televised broadcast of the Belmont, after having turned down $150,000 to allow the mascot to appear with him at the Preakness. At the post-Belmont press conference, Baffert announced he and his wife would be making substantial donations of $50,000 each to the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, the California Retirement Management Account (CARMA), and Old Friends Equine, all programs for retired race horses; and to the Permanently Disabled Jockey's Fund in memory of a Quarter Horse Jockey named Robert Z. \\"Bobby\\" Adair. A friend of Baffert's and an inductee into the American Quarter Horse Association Hall of Fame, Adair died on Preakness Day, May 16, 2015, at the age of 71.

The Celtici (in Portuguese, Spanish, and Galician languages, C√©lticos) were a Celtic tribe or group of tribes of the Iberian peninsula, inhabiting three definite areas: in what today are the regions of Alentejo and the Algarve in Portugal; in the Province of Badajoz and north of Province of Huelva in Spain, in the ancient Baeturia; and along the coastal areas of Galicia. Classical authors give various accounts of the Celtici's relationships with the Gallaeci, Celtiberians and Turdetani. Classical sources Map of the main pre-Roman tribes in Portugal and their migrations. Turduli movement in red, Celtici in brown and Lusitanian in blue. Several classical sources, Greek and Roman, mentioned the Celtici. ::Strabo (3, 1, 6) echoed Poseidonius when he mentioned the Keltikoi as the main inhabitants of the region located between the rivers Tagus and Guadiana, approximately where the Alentejo (Portugal) stands today. The Celts in Iberia: An Overview The Celtici were not considered a barbarian people. On the contrary, they were what the Greeks considered a civilized people, almost in the same degree as the Turdetani. ::They shared the same \\"gentle and civilized\\" character of the Turdetani. Strabo put this down to the fact that they were neighbouring populations, and Polybius proposed that they were related, \\"although the Celtici are less [civilized] because they generally live in hamlets (Str., 3, 2, 15).\\" Their main cities were Lacobriga (probably Lagos in the Algarve), Caepiana (in Alentejo), Braetolaeum, Mir√≥briga (near Santiago do Cac√©m), Arcobriga, Meribriga, Catraleucus, Turres, Albae and Arandis (near Castro Verde and Ourique). Other important cities were Nertobriga, Turobriga, Segida, Ebora, Caetobriga and Eburobrittium (√ìbidos), among other settlements. They appear to be the main group responsible for the \\"celticization\\" of the Conii, in the Algarve. ::Their most famous city was Conistorgis (Str., 3, 2, 2), which, according to different sources, belonged to the Cunetes or Conii (App., Iber. 56-60). Similarly, Strabo (3, 2, 15) indicated that the Celtici established colonies, such as Pax Julia (Beja). The origin of the Baeturian Celts was, according to Pliny, from the Celtici of Lusitania and were also kin to the Gallaeci: ::Celticos a Celtiberis ex Lusitania advenisse manifestum est sacris, lingua, oppidorum vocabulis, quae cognominibus in Baetica distinguntur.C. PLINII NATVRALIS HISTORIAE LIBER III ::The Celtici from Guadiana had blood links with the Galician Celts, since there had been large- scale migration to the northwest of these Celts along with the Turduli (Str., 3, 3, 5). ::...[Pliny considers the Celtici who extend into Baetica] to have migrated from Lusitania which he appears to regard as the original seat of the whole Celtic population of the Iberian peninsula including the Celtiberians, on the ground of an identity of sacred rites, language, and names of cities.Sir William Smith (1854), Dictionary of Greek and Roman geography, Volume 2, Boston, Little, Brown and Company. These migratory patterns have persisted on the same axis until modern times, supporting a centuries-old traditional and seasonal farming and animal husbandry transhumance along the ancient Roman or Carthaginian Silver road that served for its rich mines production transport, and for the Astorga region peddlers and wagoneers, the Maragatos. Pliny also noted that already in Roman times the inhabitants of Mir√≥briga (one of the Celtic cities of the region, near Santiago do Cac√©m) used the surname of Celtici: \\"Mirobrigenses qui Celtici cognominantur\\". In the sanctuary of Mir√≥briga a resident leaves their Celtic origin recorded: :::http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/GERI/article/viewFile/GERI8888220019A/14757.pdf Breve noticia sobre o santu√°rio campestre romano de Mir√≥briga dos C√©lticos (in Portuguese) Origins Traditional theories hold that the Celtici were a group that included several populi, namely the Saefes and the Cempsii, of unknown origin, which according to modern research possibly belonged to one of the first settlements of Celtic origin; and initially perhaps also the possible proto-Lusitanians (the Ligus, Lusis or Lycis), all mentioned in the Ora Maritima (\\"Sea Coasts\\") of Avienus,The Celts in Portugal, Teresa J√∫dice Gamito, University of Algarve, Volume 6 / The Celts in the Iberian Peninsula - E-Keltoi, Center for Celtic Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2008 Alarc√£o, Jorge.

The Celtici of Alentejo and Baeturia Celtic expansions in western Europe (Celtici - south Portugal and south-western Spain). The main Eburones‚Äô cities were their presumed capital Ebora (√âvora), Segovia (archeological site near Campo Maior, Elvas), the coastal town of Mirobriga Celticorum (archeological site near Santiago do Cac√©m), and five other towns within Alentejo. Around the 3rd Century BC they managed to push southwards towards the western Algarve coast where they founded the port of Laccobriga (Monte Moli√£o, near Lagos) in Conii territory. In Baeturia, the Bituriges set their capital at Nertobriga (Cerro del Coto, Fregenal de la Sierra ‚Äì Badajoz) whilst the Turones placed theirs at Turobriga (Llanos de La Belleza, near Aroche ‚Äì Huelva) and both peoples controlled six other cities. The Celtici of Ultima Celtiberia In Baetica the Celtici held or had a presence in some city-states, namely Celti (Pe√±aflor ‚Äì Seville), Urso (Osuna ‚Äì Seville), Obulco/Obulcula (Castillo de la Monclova, Fuentes de Andaluc√≠a ‚Äì Seville; Iberian-type mint: Ipolca), Tribola (Baena ‚Äì C√≥rdoba), Munda (Montilla? ‚Äì C√≥rdoba), Tucci/Itucci (Los Martos, near Ja√©n ‚Äì C√≥rdoba), Turobriga (Tur√≥n ‚Äì Granada), Cartima (C√°rtama ‚Äì M√°laga), Arunda (Ronda ‚Äì M√°laga) and Acinipo (Ronda la Vieja ‚Äì M√°laga). The Celtici of Gallaecia Further North in Gallaecia, another group of CelticiCeltici: Pomponius Mela and Pliny; ŒöŒµŒªœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ: Strabo dwelt the coastal areas. They comprised several populi, including the Celtici proper: the Praestamarci south of the Tambre river (Tamaris), the Supertamarci north of it, and the Neri by the Celtic promontory (Promunturium Celticum), whom Strabo considered related to the Celtici of Lusitania, settled in Gallaecia after a military campaign held jointly with the Turduli Veteres. Pomponius Mela affirmed that all the inhabitants of the coastal regions, from the bays of southern Gallaecia and up to the Astures, were also Celtici: \\"All (this coast) is inhabited by the Celtici, except from the Douro river to the bays, where the Grovi dwelt (‚Ä¶) In the north coast first there are the Artabri, still of the Celtic people (Celticae gentis), and after them the Astures.\\"', Pomponius Mela, De Chorographia, III, 7-9. He also mentioned the fabulous isles of tin, the Cassiterides, as situated among these Celtici.Pomponius Mela, De Chorographia, III, 40. The Celtici Supertarmarci have also left a number of inscriptions, Cf. Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss / Slaby . as the Celtici Flavienses did. Several villages and rural parishes still bear the name C√©ltigos (from Latin Celticos) in Galicia. This is also the name of an archpriesthood of the Catholic Church, a division of the archbishopric of Santiago de Compostela, encompassing part of the lands attributed to the Celtici Supertamarci by ancient authors. Culture Archaeology confirms that the material culture of the southwestern Celtici was deeply influenced by the Arevaci of Celtiberia and beyond, as their metalwork shows strong parallels with south-central Gaul, Liguria, Etruria, and central Italy. The Baetic Celtici soon fell under the cultural influence of their Iberian Turdetani neighbors, as well as receiving Hellenistic elements from the Carthaginians. History Submitted to Carthaginian rule just prior to the 2nd Punic War, the Celtici of Alentejo and Beturia recovered their independence in 206 BC whereas their Baetic counterparts simply shifted their allegiance from Carthage to the Roman Republic. In 197 BC the Ultima Celtiberia was included in the new Hispania Ulterior Province, though they were only conquered by the Ulterior Praetor Tiberius Gracchus the Elder in 179 BC. The Beturian Celtici tribes however, rose in support of a Turdetanian rebellion soon afterwards,Livy, Ad Urbe Condita, 33: 21, 6. and allied with the Lusitani and Vettones, promptly began to raid the lands of the Roman Spanish allies in Baetica and the Cyneticum throughout the 2nd Century BC. They proved to be the most reliable allies of the Lusitani ‚Äì whose chieftain Viriathus used western Beturia as a rear base for its military operations on the south ‚Äì in deep contrast to the Celtici city-states of Baetica, who frequently changed sides according to circumstances.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliothekes Istorikes, 33, 7, 4-7. When the tide turned against the Lusitani in 141 BC, the Beturian Celtici were subjected to the punitive campaigns conducted in the Iberian southwest by Consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus, who invaded eastern Beturia and plundered five towns allied with Viriathus.Appian, Iberik√©, 68.

The album was released in 2000 by the duo's own label Hands on Music. The album exclusively features cover versions of thirteen songs by the duo, chosen and recorded to reflect the band's contemporary musical influences. As such, the album contains no Steve Knightley compositions. The album was recorded over two days in Chudleigh Town Hall, Devon, with producer Gerald O'Farrell, and features only \\"straight performances\\", with its songs being untouched by post-production or techniques such as overdubbing or double tracking, presenting a \\"live\\" sound. The album followed their limited edition release Folk Music (1998), which featured the band's versions of traditional folk songs, and was the duo's first array into creating an album of music without Knightley compositions. The album was released to a positive critical reception, with Dave Tuxford of Living Tradition was \\"superbly produced\\" and that \\"it's unlikely that you'll be less than impressed.\\" The album's cover version of Billy Joel's \\"The Downeaster 'Alexa'\\" was featured on the band's compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands (2007). A follow-up album of cover versions, Covers 2, was recorded with Miranda Sykes and released in November 2010. Background In 1996, Show of Hands performed at the Royal Albert Hall, London, with the performance resulting in the live album Live at the Royal Albert Hall. The performance was not expected to be a success, but tickets sold out in advance, and the live album became the band's best-selling album. Steve Knightley of the duo noted that as a result of its success, \\"it's easier to get in local papers. But we now need to replace that with a story about the music. That's the dilemma.\\" The following album Dark Fields (1997) was ultimately a critical success, despite its single \\"Crazy Boy\\" underperforming commercially. After touring in promotion of Dark Fields, the duo recorded Folk Music (1998), an album featuring the band's new versions of traditional folk songs, released only for a short time at the band's concerts and on their website.Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes. The duo had not previously recorded an album of music that did not feature any compositions by Knightley, disregarding the album's rendition of \\"The Train\\". Although the album was a limited edition, its concept would prove inspirational on the duo for their next album. With Knightley releasing his solo album Track of Words (1999), Show of Hands did not want to work on another album featuring Knightley's songs so quickly, and instead, the duo decided to record an album of cover versions that reflected the band's increasing number of contemporary influences. Recording and music The album was recorded at Chudleigh Town Hall (pictured). The album was recorded at the Town Hall of Chudleigh, Devon, over two days in January 2000. Recording with regular producer Gerald O'Farrell, the duo decided on capturing a \\"live\\" sound for the album, with no post-production work. The album contains what Knightley described as \\"straight performances\\"; the duo set up a small PA system in the hall and recorded into it, with Knightley noting that what \\"came out on the other end was the finished production\\".Roots: The Best of Show of Hands liner notes. As such, the album contains no multitracking or overdubs, and the duo are the only musicians to feature on the album, becoming their first album not to feature guest musicians.Liner notes. The album contains thirteen cover versions, chosen by the duo to reflect some of their contemporary musical influences.Roots: The Best of Show of Hands. The album has been described as \\"eclectic\\". One of the songs, \\"Counting is a Pleasure\\", is a traditional song, featuring Nic Jones' arrangement of the song. The album opens with a \\"sensitive reading\\" of Ian Anderson's \\"Wond'ring Around\\". Their cover version of Lowell George's \\"Willin'\\" was described as \\"gutsy\\", whilst their version of Mike Chapman's \\"lament to a lost love\\", \\"No Song to Sing\\", is complemented by their version of Ralph McTell's \\"leaving song\\", \\"The Setting\\", which the duo had \\"skilfully interwoven\\" with the traditional Celtic piece \\"Mary from Dungloe\\". The album concludes with an acoustic version of The Kinks' \\"Waterloo Sunset\\". Release The album was released in early 2000 on the band's own label Hands on Music with the catalogue number HMCD12.Liner notes. The album's artwork is completely black and white, bar the silver face of the CD. The album received a positive reception from music critics. Dave Tuxford of Living Tradition praised the album as an \\"eclectic collection ranging from Tom Robinson to Bob Dylan\\" and noted to readers that \\"if you're a fan you're bound to enjoy this CD, superbly produced as usual by Gerard O'Farrell. Even if you're not, it's unlikely that you'll be less than impressed.\\" Following its release, the band returned to recording albums of their own compositions, beginning with Cold Frontier (2001). Nonetheless, in November 2010, they released a follow-up album to Covers entitled Covers 2. The album, a collaboration with Miranda Sykes, was again an attempt to reflect the duo's influences. In 2007, the duo's cover of Billy Joel's \\"The Downeaster 'Alexa'\\" from Covers was featured on the band's best-of retrospective compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands.

He served on the High Court of Australia from 1930 to 1976, the longest-serving judge in the court's history. McTiernan was born in Glen Innes, New South Wales. He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1915, and was called to the bar the following year. McTiernan was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1920, representing the Labor Party, and was soon after appointed Attorney-General of New South Wales. He served as attorney-general under John Storey, James Dooley, and Jack Lang, but left state politics in 1927. McTiernan was elected to the House of Representatives in 1929, but served for little over a year before Prime Minister James Scullin nominated him to the High Court. He was 38 at the time; only H. V. Evatt (another Scullin nominee) was appointed at a younger age. On the court, McTiernan was considered a moderate, and was known for the consistency of his decisions. He generally favoured the position of the federal government, upholding the constitutionality of contentious legislation from both sides of politics. McTiernan retired reluctantly at the age of 84, after just under 46 years on the High Court bench. He lived to the age of 97, and was the last surviving MP from the 1920s. Early years McTiernan was born in Glen Innes, New South Wales, the second of three sons born to Isabella (n√©e Diamond) and Patrick McTiernan. His parents were Irish Catholic immigrants; his father worked as a policeman. McTiernan began his education at Metz Public School, located in a small settlement west of Hillgrove. He and his family moved to Sydney in 1900, when he was about eight. He completed his education at Catholic schools, Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham, and St Mary's Cathedral College.John M. Williams and Fiona Wheeler, 'McTiernan, Sir Edward Aloysius (Eddie) (1892‚Äì1990)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mctiernan-sir-edward-aloysius- eddie-14854/text26039, published first in hardcopy 2012, accessed online 18 October 2017 McTiernan left school in 1908 initially lacking the funds to attend university, instead joining the Commonwealth Public Service as a clerk. He eventually began studying part-time at the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1912. He subsequently served his articles of clerkship at Sly & Russell while completing a Bachelor of Laws, graduating with first-class honours in 1915. He was called to the bar the following year and was taken on as an associate of Justice George Rich, whom he would eventually join on the High Court. He was rejected for military service during World War I due to an arm fracture sustained in childhood that had never properly healed. Political career McTiernan as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. After five years as a barrister, McTiernan was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1920 as the Member for Western Suburbs. McTiernan served in the ministry as Attorney-General of New South Wales from April 1920 to April 1922 and again from June 1925 to May 1927, He was heavily involved in Premier Jack Lang's attempt to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council. He retired from the Assembly in 1927 and took up a position as a law lecturer with his alma mater. Two years later, however, he was elected to federal parliament as the member for Parkes. This was to be short-lived, as in 1930, one year into McTiernan's term, Prime Minister James Scullin nominated him to the High Court of Australia, along with H. V. Evatt. Their appointment was controversial, due to their youth (McTiernan was 38 and Evatt 36), perceived inexperience, and political connections ‚Äì both were members of the Labor Party up until taking office, and the Labor caucus had publicly resolved \\"that the government should appoint to the bench two men known to have social views sympathetic to Labor\\". High Court McTiernan c. 1930 As a judge of the High Court, McTiernan was involved in several significant cases in Australian legal history, including Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth, which struck down an attempt to nationalise the banks, Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth, which struck down an attempt to ban the Communist Party of Australia and R v Kirby; ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia, which reinforced the doctrine of the separation of powers. He was the sole dissenter in Attorney-General (Vic) ex rel Dale v Commonwealth (1945), which struck down the Chifley Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and triggered a constitutional amendment. He served under five Chief Justices - Sir Isaac Isaacs, Sir Frank Gavan Duffy, Sir John Latham, Sir Owen Dixon and Sir Garfield Barwick, and was knighted himself in 1951.Sir Edward McTiernan (family history) McTiernan was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court; the others were Edmund Barton, Richard O'Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy.Evatt served in the Federal Parliament after his resignation from the High Court. He was also one of six justices to have served in the Parliament of New South Wales, along with Barton, O'Connor, Albert Piddington, Adrian Knox and H. V. Evatt. McTiernan was a member of the High Court for 46 years, making him the longest-serving judge in its history. This record is unlikely to be broken, as a constitutional change in 1977 introduced compulsory retirement ages for federal judges; a justice of the High Court must now retire at 70.Constitution section 71, after Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) 1977 McTiernan had no intention of resigning from the bench even into the 1970s, but, after breaking a hip at the age of 84 in 1976 while chasing a cricket in his hotel with a rolled up newspaper, Chief Justice Barwick's refusal to include a wheelchair ramp in the design of the new High Court building prompted his retirement. =Secret inquiry= In 1943, McTiernan was approached by Attorney-General H. V. Evatt to conduct an inquiry into claims that test results at the Aircraft Production Commission Testing Laboratory in Sydney had been fabricated. This might have compromised the structural integrity of Bristol Beaufort bombers being used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Arthur Calwell, the Minister for Information, applied strict wartime censorship to the inquiry, with no press coverage allowed. The full report has never been made public, although a summary prepared for cabinet is held by the National Archives. McTiernan was effectively granted the powers of a Royal Commissioner. His inquiry is the third and most recent occasion on which a sitting High Court judge was called upon to investigate a matter on behalf of the federal government (usually regarded as a breach of separation of powers). The other two instances occurred during World War I, when George Rich and Samuel Griffith conducted Royal Commissions. Personal life According to Jack Lang, McTiernan was \\"very much attached to his parents\\". He did not marry until the age of 56, wedding Kathleen Lloyd on 27 December 1948 at St Roch's Catholic Church, Glen Iris, Melbourne. The couple had no children. McTiernan died in Turramurra, Sydney, on 9 January 1990, at the age of 97. He was buried in Rookwood Cemetery. He is the oldest lived High Court judge, and at the time of his death was the last remaining member of parliament from the 1920s.

Some sources, like Alarc√£o,See Jorge de Alarc√£o, Portugal Romano, Lisboa, 1973 (see page 18 of the 1976 edition) - also published in English as Jorge de Alarc√£o, Roman Portugal, Warminster, 1988 (in 4 volumes). also state that the Coelerni lived in the north of modern Portugal, in the province of Tr√°s-os-Montes, in the mountains between the rivers Tua and Sabor - this seems to be incorrect and predates the finding of the Tessera Hospitalis of Castromao. However there was a lusitanian people of the Colarni (inscription of Alcantara) living near the Douro river in Lamego, that could have some link with the galician Coelerni. Classical Sources The Coelerni are known from few literary sources, such as Pliny and Ptolemy, and because they appear as one of the ten civitates of the convent Bracarensis that are cited in the Inscription of the Peoples of Chaves (the Roman Aquae Flaviae), a column in the Roman bridge in Chaves where those people rend homage to Emperor Vespasian.This inscription, made in 79, commemorates the road open by the Legionnaires of the VII Gemina Felix Legion, because that road had been opened with the contributions of ten Civitas, named alphabetically: Aquiflaviensis, Aobrigensis, Bibali, Coelerni, Equaesi, Interamnici, Limici, Naebisoci, Quarquerni and Tamagani. Pliny, knew the Iberian Peninsula, as he had worked there as an administrator during the reign of Vespasian. The results of a census he passes on to us informs about the following: ¬´The jurisdiction of Lucus contains 15 peoples both unimportant and bearing outlandish names, excepting the Celtici and the Lemavi, but with a free population amounting to about 166,000. In a similar way the 24 states [civitates] of Braga contain 285,000 persons, of whom besides the Bracari themselves may be mentioned, without wearying the reader, the Biballi, Coelerni, Callaeci, Equaesi, Limici and Querquerni (Naturalis Historia, III, 3, 28).[28] Iunguntur iis Astrum XXII populi divisi in Augustanos et Trasmontanos, Asturica urbe magnifica. in iis sunt Gigurri, Paesici, Lancienses, Zoelae. numerus omnis multitudinis ad CCXL liberorum capitum. Lucensis conventus populorum est sedecim, praeter Celticos et Lemavos ignobilium ac barbarae appellationis, sed liberorum capitum ferme CLXVI. Simili modo Bracarum XXIIII civitates CCLXXXV capitum, ex quibus praeter ipsos Bracaros Bibali, Coelerni, Callaeci, Equasei, Limici, Querquerni citra fastidium nominentur. Main city The main city of the Coelerni was Coeliobriga, now Castromao in Celanova The Tabvla Imperii Romani states (p. 46): ¬´Coeliobriga (Castromao. Celanova) - Importante castro que permite situar Coeliobriga en Castromao gracias al hallazgo de la tessera de hospitalidad entre los Coelerni y el prefecto de la cohors I Celtiberorum, fechada en 132 d.C.¬ª. (Ourense, Galicia, Spain). This Castro was inhabited from the 6th century BC until the beginning of the 4th century CE. Treaty with Rome A Treaty of Friendship between the Coelerni and the Romans was made in 132. A Tessera Hospitalis was found stating a pact of hospitality between the tribe of the Coelerni, thus accepting their peaceful integration in Hispania Citerior, and the Roman military commander of the Legion VII Gemina Civitas Limicorum, Gneo Antonius Aquilus Novaugustanus, in exchange for their defence under Emperor Hadrian. The exact text of the Tessera Hospitalis states: G(neo) IVLIO. SERVIO. AUGURINO. G(eneo) TREBIO. SERGIANO. CO(n)S(ulibus). COELERNI. EX-HISPANIA. CITERIORE. CONVENTUS. BRACARI. CVM. G ( neo).

Which can be translated as: Being Consuls Gneo Julio Augurino and Gneo Trebio Sergiano, the Coelerni of Hispania Citerior and of the convent Bracari, made a pact of hospitality with Gneo Antonio Aquilino Novaugustano, prefect of the first Cohort of the Celtiberians, with his sons and descendants.

The Time Protocol may be implemented over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). A host connects to a server that supports the Time Protocol on port 37. The server then sends the time as a 32-bit unsigned integer in binary format and in network byte order, representing the number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January, 1900 GMT, and closes the connection. Operation over UDP requires the sending of any datagram to the server port, as there is no connection setup for UDP. The fixed 32-bit data format means that the timestamp rolls over approximately every 136 years, with the first such occurrence on 7 February 2036. Programs that use the Time Protocol must be carefully designed to use context-dependent information to distinguish these dates from those in 1900. Many Unix-like operating systems used the Time Protocol to monitor or synchronize their clocks using the rdate utility, but this function was superseded by the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the corresponding ntpdate utility. NTP is more sophisticated in various ways, among them that its resolution is finer than one second.

His name was derived as a result of his association with the city of Madurai as a protector of the city. Madurai veeran is worshiped as a guardian deity by the Tamils. The folklore is that the town of Madurai was troubled by bandits and the Pandyan king ordered Veeran to resist. Veeran then met Vellaiyammal, a royal danseuse, who was attracted to him because of his looks and skill in various arts. She asked him to teach her the Natya Shastra (tenets of dancing). The Pandyan king, who was himself attracted to Vellaiyammal, did not appreciate this development and viewed this as an affair. Some of his generals, who hated the closeness of Veeran to the king, used the opportunity to inform the king that the delay in suppressing the robbers was deliberate as Veeran was conniving with the robbers themselves. Furious, the king ordered a traitor's death for Veeran, who was taken to the gallows and had his limbs chopped off. Hearing of this, Bommi and Vellaiyammal attend the gallows to see the severed limbs and chastise the king for his injustice. The legend says that Veeran is brought back to life by the virtues of both these women and is vindicated by the presence of gods. Veeran, thereafter retires to a cave beneath what is now Meenakshi Amman Temple. A shrine was later erected at the east gate of Meenakshiamman Temple by the Pandyan king.

It lies approximately south of Redhill on the A23 London to Brighton road. The village is within the civil parish of Salfords and Sidlow which covers a population of 3,069,Census and has a parish council. Etymology of the place-name Salfords means \\"willow-tree ford\\" from Old English sealh/salh \\"willow\\" and ford \\"ford. The name was recorded Selefrid in 1193. This is similar to the derivation of Salford, Greater Manchester. Description The village has its own 20th century church, Christ The King,Church of England active churches finder primary school,Salfords Primary School cricket club,Salfords cricket club some shops, cafes, a social club, a tanning salon, a number of restaurants and a take away. Salfords Stream runs through the village and can cause flooding in the autumn and winter months.Surrey flood alert The southern boundary is marked by the Burstow stream. Both are minor River Mole tributaries, itself a tributary of the River Thames. The only buildings old enough to be listed structures in the village are two adjoining houses on Brighton Road and The Mill House Hotel on the Salfords Stream. The village once boasted a wooden watermill with two sluice gates next to the Mill House Hotel. It produced breakfast cereals in the early twentieth century. By the 1950s it was defunct and has since been dismantled and partly washed away. Salfords made the national news in January 2008 when a farmer named Robert Fidler built a personal home at Honeycrock Farm similar in style to a Tudor castle and disguised it with hay bales and tarpaulin for four years in an attempt to avoid planning permission from Surrey County Council.BBC NEWSBBC NEWShttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-36445848 Surrey Police applied for planning permission in 2010 for permission to build a 30-cell custody suite at the IO business centre to replace the existing facility at Reigate. This was extremely unpopular with the residents who packed out two meetings with Surrey Police in the local village hall to air their concerns over increases in crime and traffic, resulting in the first meeting being postponed to a larger venue. Surrey Police continued with the planning application despite the overwhelming opposition of the community, but the application was subsequently refused by Reigate and Banstead Council in June 2010. Surrey Police announced in December that they were appealing the decision; this has now been referred to the Planning Inspectorate. Subsequently the Planning Inspectorate decided to ignore the wishes of both the local community and the council and have granted permission to Surrey Police to build the facility to a revised design. History Until the 1970s Salfords was part of Horley and with its own Victorian Chapel Church, owing its existence to the construction of the A23 road. The original trackway passed just to the east, on the other side of what is now the London to Brighton railway, dated as pre medieval. This trackway came from Redhill, passing in front of the Royal Earlswood Hospital, through Whitebushes and crossing the stream/river 'Sal' at Dean Farm, Salfords. It then ran in front of the former Monotype Corporation site towards the Horley gasometer, passed the moated Thunderfield Castle (a 13th-century manor) on 'Harolds Lea' and reached the south coast near Brighton. In the 1870s a state school was built on the fork between the London Road and Woodhatch Road on Petridge Common. The school consisted of four classrooms three were divided by sliding glass doors. The head teacher was located upstairs above the cloakrooms. In World War II two air raid shelters were built on opposite sides of the long tapering playground. In the mid-1950s the then \\"Salfords County Primary School\\" started to expand and relocated to Copsleigh Avenue. The railway station was built in 1915 to enable workers access to the Monotype Corporation factory. Today it is served by London Bridge/London Victoria to Horsham trains. On the main road Hall & Co, the dominant building materials supplier in the south east of England had their regional maintenance depot, used in WWII to repair war tanks. Cricket club Salfords Cricket Club Salfords Cricket Club is a village cricket club. The club runs two Saturday League sides in the Surrey Downs League and a Sunday friendly side. The club host a \\"Cricket Week\\" of mid-week games each July, and a tour every August. The club now play on a council-owned ground on Petridge Wood Common, off Woodhatch Road. Salfords Cricket Club was formed in 1921. The Club's first captain was Tom Enever, whose photograph can be seen in the pavilion today. The Council relocated the club to its present ground at Petridge Wood Common in 1960.

It can also refer to abilities that influence or prevent the abilities or actions of other characters. Crowd control can be extremely powerful, controlling the possible outcomes of an encounter, as it forces opponents to use a smaller set of abilities/actions. Players use crowd control to create offense/defense ratio imbalances between themselves and their opponents; used properly, CC often renders an opponent nearly useless, allowing the CCer to use abilities/actions against an opponent without fear of retaliation or response. In a group setting, crowd control often makes combat safer, easier, or viable. Types of crowd control All crowd control abilities fall into one or more of three broad categories. =Movement modifiers= The ability to move faster than an opponent provides a form of crowd control, often through kiting. Any modifier that decreases an opponent's speed will allow more efficient kiting. Many forms of crowd control use this type of modifier. Traditionally, \\"root\\" and \\"snare\\" effects that directly modify opponents' movement rates by lowering them or simply preventing movement have been the staple of this type of crowd control. The abilities include, but are not limited to: * Trapping - situates the target(s) in an area where they have limited movement. * Poison - poisons the targeted character doing damage over time, usually slowing the target * Root - immobilizes character while allowing all other actions to occur * Cripple/Snare - Movement speed debuffs * Knockback - forces opponents away from the CCer * Levitate - allows CCer to use terrain advantages to line-of- sight or safely fall from a height in order to cover more ground than normally possible * Direction changes - forces opponents to move in another direction, often resulting in tempo or distance gains for the CCer * Fear/Stun/Mesmerize (\\"mez\\")/Charm - robust CC abilities that usually include other types of CC alongside one from the above list =Action/ability rate modifiers= Abilities that can decrease the number of times one can perform an action in a given time (usually by increasing cast time and/or cooldown time) or stop a player from performing actions all together. Abilities in this group may include, but are not limited to: * Silence ‚Äì Prevents the target from using spells or other such abilities, limiting their usefulness in a fight * Disarm ‚Äì The target is unable to attack normally via physical means/autoattacks, sometimes due to the target losing their weapon * Magic Immunity ‚Äì While technically a buff, a target that is magic immune cannot be affected by magical abilities * Interrupt ‚Äì An extremely brief stun that can easily disrupt channelled abilities These abilities can also affect the amount of \\"energy\\" to perform an action, be it mana or otherwise. Others can decrease damage given from actions, or increase healing from allies. =Forced action modifiers= This is the most unusual category of crowd control spells, but abilities that fall under it are often considered the most powerful. These abilities force an opponent to use certain abilities without their consent. Examples include, but are not limited to: * Mind Control ‚Äì takes control of the opponent and allows one to use some or all of their abilities * Charm ‚Äì forces opponent to fight for the caster (against its real allies) * Fear ‚Äì forces opponents to run away from the user. * Feign death ‚Äì makes it less likely or impossible for an opponent to attack the user. * Taunt ‚Äì forces opponents to attack the user. EverQuest Crowd control is generally considered critical in EverQuest, because most monsters in the modern version of the game are a match for an entire group of player characters. In EverQuest, crowd control is usually handled by the Enchanter and Bard classes, who can mesmerize (\\"mez\\") opponents through spells or songs. These stop a monster from being able to attack players; however, if the monster is affected in such a way that its hit points are reduced, the mesmerization is broken and the monster will immediately begin to attack. The duration of these effects varies by class and level. Bards can generally only mesmerize for 18 seconds at a time, but higher level Enchanters can mesmerize monsters for upwards of 72 seconds. Several types of monsters are entirely immune to this effect, and all mesmerization spells will only mesmerize monsters up to a certain level. Stuns can be used for crowd control in EQ as well. Enchanters are the primary class for this method, with a full range of point-blank AOE (PBAOE) stuns. With three or more loaded PBAOE stuns, they can \\"stun lock\\" opponents by casting the next stun before their previous stun expires. Some other classes, such as the Cleric and Necromancer, also have a limited ability to perform crowd control in this fashion, generally by using short-duration targeted stuns. Another method of Everquest crowd control is to keep the monster occupied, such as by assigning a player to \\"tank\\" it. This is made much more effective by the use of abilities that Taunt targets, forcing them to attack the user. Only certain classes can Taunt. Monsters can also be charmed and sent against other mobs. Only creatures up to a certain level can be charmed, and charms are usually of random duration. With additional skills, charms can be made fixed duration or even permanent. Charms generate a lot of hate, so the character doing the charming runs the risk of becoming the target of attacks from the mob. World of Warcraft In World of Warcraft different classes have different crowd control abilities. As of version 1.12, every class has at least one spell that can render an enemy target (player or non- player) unable to move and/or attack for a short period of time. Some of these spells have a cooldown, while others can be chain cast and used to incapacitate a non-player target for as long as required. In general, longer and more powerful crowd control effects render the victims immune to damage or will break after they take damage, and in PvP combat these effects have so- called diminishing returns, which means applying the same effect repeatedly will decrease the length of the effect for the next application. Generally, the third application of the same effect in a short period of time renders the target immune to that effect for 15 seconds, which is also the time for the diminishing returns' timers for an effect to reset. Death knights can silence enemies and interrupt their spell-casting, stop them and make them gradually regain their full movement speed, and if specialized for it, fully incapacitate all targets around them for a short period of time by encasing them in blocks of ice. In addition, death knights have a unique spell called Death Grip, which can also be considered a crowd control effect as the ability instantly pulls an enemy target to them. Druids can put beast and dragonkin type monsters to sleep, root enemies in place with a vine spell, and incapacitate any enemy (player or non-player) for a short duration with Cyclone, which causes the victim to be immune to any damage or healing. Hunters are able to set up freeze traps that can encase an opponent in a solid block of ice as they walk over it, frost traps to slow movement considerably in a small radius, and snake traps which slow movement and cause damage. They can also scare beasts making them run around in fear for a while. If specialized for it, hunters can also cast a scatter shot which disorients the target or a wyvern sting which puts the target to sleep. Mages can use a spell called Polymorph to turn humanoid and beast type enemies into harmless sheep or other critters for 50 seconds (10 seconds in PvP), although the victim will regenerate health very quickly in this state. Any damage done to the target will remove the effect and will be in vain if the victim is polymorphed again, as the victim will regenerate to full health in just a few seconds. Mages can cripple their opponents' spell casting ability as well by using Counterspell, which will force the target to interrupt their spellcasting and block similar spells for a few seconds. The Frost Nova spell roots multiple targets in place around the mage for several seconds and can also be used for crowd control, while Blast Wave allows mages specialized in it to snare enemies in a radius. Priests can perform an AoE fear every 30 seconds and they have the ability to Mind Control enemies. They also can shackle undead type enemies, rendering them unable to move or attack for 50 seconds. Paladins can stun enemies for six seconds with the Hammer of Justice spell every minute and fear undead and demon monsters, preventing attacks and forcing them to run away. Rogues, while in stealth and out of combat, are able to Sap a humanoid opponent that is not in combat, incapacitating it for up to one minute. Most methods of crowd control in WoW, will initiate combat with the target, so the victim will attack the player when the incapacitating effect wears off. However, Sap is a notable exception; neither the Sapped victim nor the surrounding enemies will engage in combat. Like most crowd control spells, the Sap effect will also be removed by any damage, but it cannot be applied repeatedly in combat. Rogues have other types of crowd control effects mostly for PvP combat, such as stuns, poisons. Shamans have the ability to reduce a single opponent's movement speed (Frost Shock) and a group of opponents' movement speed (Earthbind Totem). They can also interrupt a target's spellcasting with Wind Shear, similarly to the way mages can with Counterspell, however Wind Shear's cooldown and duration of the spell block effect is lower. Hex, introduced in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, allows shamans to turn enemies into a frog for a short period of time, rendering them unable to attack but free to move around. Warlocks can banish elementals and demons, making them immune to everything, but unable to move or attack. Using a Succubus (a summoned demon), warlocks can seduce humanoids, causing them to stand love struck and unable to act. Warlocks can also cast Fear on their opponents, making them run around in panic. There is no cooldown on this ability and it can affect any creature type. Warriors have various stun and spell casting interrupt abilities. Protection warriors (tanks) can stun a whole pack of enemies in front of them with their Shockwave ability. Warriors can also intimidate enemies around them with a fierce shout, making them run around or freeze in fear for a short time. City of Heroes and City of Villains In City of Heroes and its expansion, City of Villains, the Controller archetype is the primary provider of crowd control effects. Controllers, depending on their primary power set, have a variety of options for crowd control‚Äîessentially all of the effects in the above list‚Äîbut the most commonly used effect is the Hold, which prevents an opponent from attacking or moving at all for a time. Dominators, a City of Villains archetype, share the Controllers' crowd control abilities, but with substantially reduced duration under most circumstances. To balance this limitation, a Dominator has access to an inherent power called \\"Domination.\\" After a Dominator has inflicted enough damage with his or her attacks, this power can be activated, which doubles the duration and \\"magnitude\\" of his crowd control effects for a short time. Domination allows the Dominator, when it is most needed, to provide considerable crowd control and damage. However, while Controllers and Dominators are designed to provide crowd control, all other archetypes have access to some crowd control effects; for instance, all Blasters have access to Immobilization effects in their secondary power sets. Crowd control in City of Heroes is generally very short in duration and not particularly effective on large groups of opponents or powerful opponents (such as Bosses, Archvillains, and Giant Monsters), in keeping with the game's design principles. This limitation is a function of \\"magnitude,\\" which can be circumvented to a degree by using multiple crowd control effects or by augmenting magnitude using Domination. Because of these problems, crowd control is not considered an essential function in City of Heroes, and many groups operate effectively without a Controller or any appreciable use of crowd control effects by simply overwhelming their opponents with massive force. In Issue 5, all crowd control was substantially weakened by reducing the duration and increasing the recharge of powers that offer it, especially if those powers could affect multiple targets. This has further deemphasized its role in gameplay. As in EverQuest, crowd control can also be provided by having a sufficiently resistant character, such as a Tanker, Scrapper, or Brute archetype character, keep the opponents occupied by \\"tanking\\" them. Tankers and Brutes are intended to be much more effective in this role, and it is not unheard of for a Tanker to \\"tank\\" upwards of 10 opponents at once and survive. Tankers, Scrappers, and Brutes all have powers that Taunt, which makes this task easier, but changes to the game in Issue 5 limit the number of targets that can be effectively controlled in this fashion, and the overall reduction in character defense makes tanking more dangerous. As of Issue 7, the Mastermind archetype has an inherent power called \\"Bodyguard\\" that, under specific circumstances, allows him to redistribute damage taken to his pets. Despite his limited hit points, a Mastermind can act as a \\"tank\\" using this power if carefully played. In City of Heroes PvP combat, Controllers and Dominators who successfully Hold an opponent inflict triple normal damage with their powers. In Issue 5, Controllers gained a similar version of this advantage in the rest of the game through a new inherent power called \\"Containment.\\" This power allows a Controller to inflict double damage against any target that is suffering from a Hold, Immobilize, Sleep, or Disorient effect. A similar version of Containment is part of the inherent power of Stalkers, Assassination. These characters have a chance to land a critical hit for double damage against any target under a Hold or Sleep effect in both PvP and PvE combat. Ultima Online In Ultima Online, the most common CC spells are Paralyze and Poison (although Poison is meant to be a debuff or damage over time, it also prevents a character from healing himself with certain methods). There are other CC abilities that also prevent healing as well as a spell known as Force Field, meant to block passages. Two skilled players can create a \\"cross\\" by casting Force Field along the X and Y axes of the map, locking the target in place for a time much longer than Paralyze. This allows them to subsequently cast spells for a longer time without fear of retaliation from the target (unless the target can attack from afar, like archers and magical users). MOBAs In MOBAs, crowd control refers to anything which prevents or limits a player or mob‚Äôs ability to fight, as well as impair their ability to move. There are a wide variety of types of crowd control, and most player-controlled characters have some means of crowd control. The most common forms of CC are slows, which decrease the player‚Äôs movement, cripples which reduce attack speed, and stuns, which stop the player from moving or performing any actions. The support (tank) role will usually have more forms of CC than other roles due to their play-style being more about defense and area control. There are also other forms of CC in MOBAs, including silences, which remove the player‚Äôs ability to cast spells or abilities; taunts, which force the player to run to a certain point or character (usually the caster of the taunt); hex, which transforms the player into a harmless creature and unable to perform any actions other than moving; fears, which force the player to run away from a certain point or character (usually the caster of the fear), and many other forms of CC that take place in their respective game.

History The Network was a professional wrestling stable that was formed in 1999 when ECW began to broadcast nationally on TNN. TNN did not give ECW much money to produce their program, yet expected ECW to have high-quality production values like WCW Monday Nitro and Monday Night Raw. Also, TNN poorly advertised and promoted ECW, producing barely any press releases or TV ads, even though ECW was TNN's highest rated weekly program at that point. The only real time that TNN actually advertised ECW was during the ECW program itself. In fact, during ECW broadcasts, there were actually commercial ads for the archrival WCW's programs, such as Thunder! Heyman decided to recruit Don Callis, who played the part of Cyrus, to serve as a metaphor, so to speak, for the real problems between ECW and TNN at that point. Callis played a representative for TNN/The Network, who constantly criticized the violent nature of ECW programming, and commentator Joel Gertner in particular for his sexually-loaded commentary and ring introductions. Callis would threaten to replace ECW's programming with episodes of RollerJam. Cyrus was joined in his quest against ECW by Steve Corino, the self-proclaimed \\"King of Old School\\", who got heat railing against hardcore wrestling. Corino brought with him the wrestlers he managed who then became \\"The Network\\"; Rhino, Yoshihiro Tajiri, and Corino's own manager and old school wrestler Jack Victory. When Corino turned on Justin Credible, the group slowly imploded until only Cyrus, Rhino and Jerry Lynn remained allies, up until the point where Cyrus managed Rhino to the ECW World Heavyweight Championship and Jerry Lynn against the returning Rob Van Dam at the final pay-per-view.

Following the duo's successful Royal Albert Hall performance in 2001 which was televised as The Big Gig, the duo released the studio album Cold Frontier in September of that year, which saw the duo use a more basic instrumental set up that what they had grown accustomed to. A critical success, they followed it with The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001. The tour was unusual in that the duo opted to perform both obscure older material and cover versions in re- arranged formats, in addition to material from Cold Frontier. Many of the tracks had never featured on a Sho of Hands album before. A critical success, the duo and Mick Dolan had recorded performances from the tour for usage as the live album Cold Cuts. The album was released on 22 July 2002 by the duo's own record label Hands on Music. It reflects the unusual tour's track listing and re-arrangements, and was a critical success, being seen as more than just a souvenir for the tour and being a worthwhile acquisition in its own right. Despite being their sole live album to contain unreleased material, the album is often overlooked by the duo. Unlike other CD-released albums by the duo, none of its songs feature on their retrospective compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands (2007), nor is the album referred to in its booklet. Background and tour After releasing their sixth studio album Dark Fields (1997), Show of Hands focused on releasing albums of material by other artists, namely an album of traditional folk music, Folk Music (1998), and an album of contemporary cover versions designed to reflect the duo's contemporary influences, Covers (2000). The latter album presented a stripped down sound with no overdubs or multitracking.Covers liner notes. They followed this with their second concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was filmed for their VHS concert film The Big Gig ‚Äì Show of Hands @ The Royal Albert Hall (2001). The film was filmed by ITV franchise holder Carlton Productions, who broadcast it on ITV Carlton as two dedicated half-hour programmes. The performance and television transmission, which themselves were a measure of the reputation the duo had built up until then, had increased interest in the duo. They recorded their ninth studio album, Cold Frontier (2001), which was co-produced between the duo and Mick Dolan, engineer for Steve Winwood, after their previous producer and manager Gerrard O'Farrell left for Australia. Cold Frontier was their first album composed by Steve Knightley of the duo since Dark Fields. Recorded in early 2001 by the River Exe in Countess Wear, Devon, the album saw the duo return \\"to a more basic instrumental setup\\" than what they had grown accustomed to. One description noted that the duo had \\"created their own unique musical style by combining the narrative strengths of English and Celtic traditional music with instruments and textures from other cultures.\\" The album was critically acclaimed, and they followed this with the seven-date The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001. The tour was unlike previous tours by the duo; in addition to performing songs from Cold Frontier, the opportunity was taken to revisit older material and showcase some new arrangements of songs from other writers both familiar and unfamiliar. The tour, which was called a \\"triumph\\" by one critic, was recorded in part by Mick Dolan for usage as a live album. The duo's previous live albums, Show of Hands Live (1992) and Live at the Royal Albert Hall (1996), both document a single concert each, but the Cold Frontier Tour live album would be a compilation of tracks recorded across the tour. The duo named the album Cold Cuts (cold cuts), both a pun on Cold Frontier and also a reference to \\"deep cuts\\", a musical term meaning music that is generally not well known, reflecting the content of the tour and album itself. Music Four of the songs were recorded at The Phoenix, Exeter. Cold Cuts was recorded over each concert of the tour and, according to the duo, features \\"the new, the rearranged, and the previously unreleased songs\\" that they played on the tour. The album features a track list faithful to the material on the tour, featuring songs from Cold Frontier, obscure older material and showcase some new arrangements of songs from other writers both familiar and unfamiliar. Roughly half of the album is cover versions, some of which had been in the duo's repertoire for a while but not all of which had previously been recorded or released onto an album. One review noted that some of the cover versions are \\"quite radical rethinks\\", but that \\"none prove any less than pretty fine as covers go\\". The cover versions of Free's \\"My Brother Jake\\", Leonard Cohen's \\"First They Take Manhattan\\" and Mike Lennon's \\"Rose in the Thorn\\" have been described as being \\"surprising choices\\" upon initial inspection, but that \\"show Of Hands really make them their own\\". The \\"submarine-driven reading\\" of Cyril Tawney's \\"Sally Free and Easy\\" is energetic. Knightley's own Show of Hands songs on the album has mostly been re-arranged from their original versions. \\"Faith in You\\" and \\"Track of Words\\" feature pared down settings and revised pace, which puts a different complexion on the songs from their fulsome production on the earlier studio recordings. The latter song was never previously recorded by Show of Hands, originally being the title track on his 1999 album of the same name.Liner notes. An inspired medley, where \\"The Battle of the Somme\\" and \\"Time After Time\\" frame \\"The Keeper\\", features over three songs.Liner notes. Release The album was released 22 July 2002 by the duo's own record label Hands on Music, with the catalogue number HMCD17. It was their first album packaged in a digipak since Dark Fields. All of the duo's subsequent albums released on Hands on Music have been released in digipaks. The album was released to a positive critical reception. Dave Kidman of NetRhythms said that \\"Cold Cuts presents a sequence of live recordings from that tour, and gives a very good indication of the duo's compelling live presence and uniformly high level of instrumental and vocal accomplishment.\\" He was particularly praiseful of the re-arrangements of the duo's own material, and concluded that \\"all in all, Cold Cuts does its job really well, and in the end represents rather more than just a satisfying add-on tour memento for existing fans, being a worthwhile acquisition for its own sake.\\" Despite the critical favour, the album been somewhat ignored by the duo. No recordings from the album featured on their retrospective compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands (2007). The second disc of that album, subtitled Longdogs, featured one track each from every one of their albums, the specific tracks being chosen by an individual poll on the duo's former internet forum Longdogs. Whilst the rest of the duo's albums are covered, except for the early cassette releases which were effectively replaced with the compilation Backlog 1987‚Äì1991 (1995), Cold Cuts was the sole album omitted from the track listing. Additionally, it is also not written about in the liner notes.

He is the second and current Archbishop of Galveston-Houston, serving since 2006. He previously served as Bishop of Sioux City from 1998 to 2004. On November 12, 2013, he was elected as the Vice President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. On November 15, 2016, he was elected as the President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/us-catholic-bishops-elect- texas-cardinal-top-post-43546956 exercising a leading administrative role in the Catholic Church in the United States, until his term ended in November of 2019. DiNardo was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007. He is the first cardinal from a diocese in the Southern United States. Early life and education Daniel DiNardo was born in Steubenville, Ohio, to Nicholas and Jane (n√©e Green) DiNardo. One of four children, he has an older brother, Thomas; a twin sister, Margaret; and a younger sister, Mary Anne. The family later moved to Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. As a child, DiNardo would pretend to celebrate Mass in vestments sewn by his mother and at an altar his father constructed. He attended St. Anne Elementary School from 1955 to 1963, and graduated from the Jesuit Bishop's Latin School in 1967. He then entered St. Paul Seminary at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, where he was a classmate of David Zubik (who later became Bishop of Pittsburgh). In 1969, DiNardo was accepted as a Basselin Scholar in philosophy at Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and earned a BA in 1971 and MA in 1972, both in philosophy. He continued his studies in Rome, earning a S.T.B. at the Pontifical Gregorian University and a S.T.L. at the Patristic Institute \\"Augustinianum.\\" Priesthood DiNardo was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Vincent Leonard on July 16, 1977. He then served as parochial vicar at St. Pius X Church in Brookline until 1980. In 1981, he was named Assistant Chancellor of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and part-time professor at St. Paul Seminary. While at St. Paul, he served as spiritual director to the seminarians. From 1984 to 1990, DiNardo worked in Rome as a staff member of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia. During this time, he also served as the director of Villa Stritch (1986‚Äì1989), the house for American clergy working for the Holy See, and as an adjunct professor at the Pontifical North American College. Upon his return to the United States in 1991, he was named Assistant Secretary for Education for the Pittsburgh diocese and concurrently served as co-pastor with Paul J. Bradley of Madonna del Castello Church in Swissvale. He became the founding pastor of Saints John & Paul Parish in Franklin Park in 1994. Episcopal career =Bishop of Sioux City= On August 19, 1997, DiNardo was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Sioux City, Iowa, by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 7 from Bishop Lawrence Soens, with Bishops Donald Wuerl and Raymond Burke serving as co- consecrators, in the Church of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ. He adopted as his episcopal motto: Ave Crux Spes Unica, taken from the Latin hymn Vexilla Regis and meaning, \\"Hail, O Cross, Our Only Hope.\\" He succeeded Soens as the sixth Bishop of Sioux City upon the latter's retirement on November 28, 1998. =Archbishop of Galveston-Houston= DiNardo was later named Coadjutor Bishop of Galveston-Houston, Texas, on January 16, 2004. The diocese was elevated to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese by John Paul II on the following December 29, and he thus became Coadjutor Archbishop. When Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Joseph Fiorenza, DiNardo succeeded him as the second Archbishop of Galveston-Houston on February 28, 2006. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Benedict XVI on June 29 of that year. He once commented, \\"There is a certain sense of the church in Texas...It is more laid-back, informal, which I think is good.\\" He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Eusebio in the consistory of November 24, 2007. In 2008 he was awarded Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. On January 17, 2009, he was made a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture. In March 2009, he described the choice of President Barack Obama to be the commencement speaker for the University of Notre Dame's graduation ceremony as \\"very disappointing,\\" given Obama's support for legal abortion. Outside of the Archdiocese, Cardinal DiNardo serves on the Board of the National Catholic Partnership for Persons with Disabilities, a position to which he brings a certain empathy, contending as he does with significant hearing loss in both ears. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Catholic University of America, is an advisor to the National Association of Pastoral Musicians, is a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People and is part of the Ad Hoc Committee to Oversee the Use of the Catechism for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He is the Grand Prior of the South West Lieutenancy of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a Papal order of Knighthood, in which he holds the rank of Knight Grand Cross. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis. On November 14, 2014, at the fall meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal DiNardo was elected as a delegate to the 2015 Synod of Bishops on the Family, pending Vatican approval.http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/us-bishops-elect- delegates-to-synod-kurtz-chaput-dinardo-gomez-42472/ On November 20, 2018, it was reported that Cardinal DiNardo has kept two priests accused of past abuse in current active ministry. John LaBonte accused the Rev. John Keller of sexually molesting him at age 16. The abuse allegedly included attempting to get him drunk and fondling him in bed. LaBonte first reported his allegation to the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston in 2002. The archdiocese said in a reply that Keller admitted to \\"holding [LaBonte] in a manner inappropriate for a priest\\" and promised to admit him to therapy. However, it also stated that Keller \\"[denied] any sexual intent\\" and claimed that it \\"could not conclude that\\" what happened \\"constituted sexual abuse.\\" Keller remained in ministry. Furthermore, in a sworn affidavit, an alleged victim accused Rev. Terence Brinkman of sexual misconduct. The events allegedly took place during the 1970s. The archdiocese stated that the person making the accusation \\"provided a physical description that does not match Father Brinkman.\\" DiNardo promised to release a list of credibly accused priests in January 2019. In November, CBS News spoke to 20 people who claim to have knowledge of incidents of misconduct, and none of them had been contacted. On January 30, 2019, DiNardo released a list of names of 40 priests from the Archdiocese of Galveston- Houston who have faced allegations of sexual misconduct deemed credible by archdiocese officials in the past 70 years. One of them was Keller. However, he was criticized for allowing Keller to offer Mass publicly at his parish the morning after the list was released. Personal DiNardo wears hearing aids because calcium deposits in his ears have impaired his hearing. Despite his hearing difficulties, he still prefers to sing or chant parts of the Mass. DiNardo suffered a stroke on March 15, 2019.

The principal other component was a group from the Young Socialist League, the youth group of an adult organization called the Independent Socialist League, led by Max Shachtman.\\"The Party: The Socialist Workers Party, 1960-1988\\", Barry Sheppard, 2005, p. 21 The principal figures from the YSL were Tim Wohlforth, Shane Mage, and James Robertson, who joined with young members of the SWP (hence the word \\"alliance\\") to found the \\"Young Socialist\\" newspaper.

In late 1961 at the second YSA convention, held in Chicago, the SWP central leadership arranged the removal of Wohlforth and Robertson from the YSA on age grounds and replaced the initial majority group with Barry Sheppard and Peter Camejo from Boston, Sheppard as national chairman and Camejo as national secretary.\\"The Party: The Socialist Workers Party, 1960-1988\\", Barry Sheppard, 2005, p. 65-67, At that time the Young Socialist Alliance had approximately 150 members nationally\\"North Star: A Memoir\\", Peter Camejo, 2010, p. 27 An early activity of the YSA was a national campaign in defense of three of its members who were students at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, Tom Morgan, Ralph Levitt, and Jim Bingham, who were indicted in 1963 by local prosecutor Thomas Hoadley under a little used anticommunist statute. The students were eventually acquitted.\\"The Party: The Socialist Workers Party, 1960-1988\\", Barry Sheppard, 2005, p. 86-92, At the YSA's fourth convention, held over the 1964-65 New Year weekend in Chicago, Jack Barnes succeeded Barry Sheppard as YSA national chairman.\\"The Party: The Socialist Workers Party, 1960-1988\\", Barry Sheppard, 2005, p. 124-25, Barnes had joined the SWP in Minneapolis while a student at Carleton College in Minnesota.

The YSA achieved substantial influence in the anti-Vietnam War movement between 1965 and the early 1970s, including near complete control over the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, a national campus organization with a peak membership of some 100,000.\\"Out Now!

His first music teacher was most likely his father, organist of Beauvais Cathedral. At some point during his youth Dumage moved to Paris and studied under Louis Marchand. He also befriended Nicolas Leb√®gue, who in 1703 procured for Dumage a position of organist of the Saint- Quentin collegiate church.Apel 1972, 744. In 1710 Dumage was appointed titular organist of the Laon Cathedral. Due to strained relations with his superiors in the cathedral chapter, Dumage left on 30 March 1719, at the age of 45, and became a civil servant.Higginbottom, Grove. He apparently neither played nor composed music professionally until his death. Dumage's only surviving work is Premier livre d'orgue, published in 1708. This collection is dedicated to the chapter of Saint Quentin. It contains a single Suite du premier ton: eight pieces in the traditional French forms: Plein jeu, Fugue, Trio, Tierce en taille, Basse de Trompette, R√©cit, Duo and Grand jeu. In the brief preface Dumage explains that these are his first works, and that he modelled them after the music of his former teacher Marchand. Dumage's music is, however, of very high quality, and entirely representative of French organ music of the period. Musicologists F√©lix Raugel and Willi Apel both singled out Dumage's R√©cit for its \\"delicate and gentle lyricism\\", and Apel also praised the Tierce en taille and the Grand jeu as particularly striking. Dumage's second livre d'orgue was presented in 1712 to the chapter of Laon Cathedral, but has never been found. Notes References *Apel, Willi. 1972. The History of Keyboard Music to 1700.

St. John was educated at Midhurst, Sussex, and about 1828 obtained a clerkship in the treasury, but resigned in 1834, in which year in November he married Ann Gibson, the daughter of a rich banker in Newcastle.

Written, produced, and directed by Andrew L. Stone, the film stars Dirk Bogarde, Maria Perschy, and Alfred Lynch. It is a lighthearted take on the true story of Sergeant-Major Charles Coward, written under the pseudonym John Castle by Ronald Charles Payne and John Williams Garrod. Plot Sergeant- Major Charles Coward (Dirk Bogarde) is a senior British NCO incarcerated in the prisoner of war camp Stalag VIII-B. He encourages his fellow inmates to escape, and tries to humiliate the German army guards at every opportunity. When he was being transferred to Stalig VIII-B, the injured Coward escaped from a forced POW march, finding refuge in a French farmhouse and barn that is soon requisitioned by a German army unit needing to set up a field hospital. Inadvertently thought to be a wounded German soldier, Coward is taken to a hospital, where his identity is soon discovered, but not before he is awarded the Iron Cross as he lies in his hospital bed. Coward is sent on to POW camp Stalig VIII-B, but on the way to the camp he engineers the total destruction of a passing enemy ammunition train using tossed bundles of straw, set on fire with his cigarette lighter. At the camp he is involved in the elaborate tunnel-digging schemes and plans an escape with fellow prisoner Bill Pope (Alfred Lynch). Unfortunately an older, closed tunnel is discovered by camp officials, but not their primary tunnel. Coward then attempts to deceive his camp commander and Luftwaffe officials that he has knowledge of a secret allied bomb sight. He receives special favours, which he uses to bribe guards to get vital materials needed for the coming escape. When his ruse is discovered Coward is transferred to a Polish work camp where he is set up by the Germans as a traitor, with the camp's commanding officer trying to use his fellow British prisoners to kill Coward. When the scheme fails, he blackmails the Unteroffizier (Reginald Beckwith), who thinks he was responsible for a devastating fire that Coward had actually engineered. Coward extracts an extraordinary privilege in being able to go to and from the neighbouring town without an escort. When he makes contact with an attractive Polish resistance agent (Maria Perschy), he attempts to leave Germany by rail with his new friend providing assistance, but he is captured at a railway station.Despite the film's title, the password Coward uses to identify the agent, an optometrist, turns out to be the phrase \\"cleaning cloths\\". After the failure of that escape, Coward and his other escape partner, Pope, are assigned to the IG Farben work camp. They manage to escape again by masquerading as workmen clearing rubble in a rural area. After learning that the American front line is only a mile away, they steal an unattended fire engine in order to get past the enemy soldiers blocking their escape. Their plan works. A German troop convoy on the road moves aside to allow them to speed past to get to a non- existent fire, and they drive off to freedom.

Production The recreation of German prisoner of war camps took place in the English countryside. The Password Is Courage is based on John Castle's biography of Sergeant-Major Charles Coward. Serving as technical advisor during the filming, Coward also has a cameo in the film during a party scene. The film is shot entirely in England; street scenes were filmed in the Chiltern market towns of Amersham and Chesham.Tanitch 1988, pp. 110‚Äì111. The film raised some debate among ex-prisoners of war. There are no known survivors of any of Coward's escapes, and the National Ex-Prisoner of War Association (in its Autumn 2006 newsletter) suggested that some of the stories in his biography might have happened to other men in the camps, with some events \\"borrowed\\" for the book and for the film.Allan, Les. \\"Charlie Coward.\\" The National Ex- Prisoner of War Association Newsletter, Autumn 2006.

Reception The Password Is Courage received mixed reviews from critics because this true story of a prisoner of war was done in a jocular vein, and was considered inauthentic as a result. The review in Variety noted: \\"Andrew L. Stone‚Äôs screenplay, based on a biog of Sergeant-Major Charles Coward by John Castle, has pumped into its untidy 116 minutes an overdose of slapstick humour.

Origins Mentioned by Pliny the ElderPliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, IV, 113. and by a local epigraphic source, the 2nd Century AD Ponte de Alc√¢ntara inscription, near C√°ceres,CIL II 760: Municipia / provinciae / Lusitaniae stipe / conlata quae opus / pontis perfecerunt / Igaetani / Lancienses Oppidani / Talori / Interannienses / Colarni / Lancienses Transcudani / Aravi / Meidubrigenses / Arabrigenses / Banienses / Paesures. along with the other Lusitani tribes, their ethnic and Linguistic affiliation has not yet been fully determined. It has been suggested that the Paesuri were of Thracian origin,Ferreira do Amaral, Povos Antigos em Portugal‚Ä¶ (1997), p. 141. though to what extent they were celticized by their neighbors, the Lusitani, Gallaeci and Turduli Veteres, remains unclear. Location Located between the rivers Douro and Vacua or Vagua (Vouga), in the modern northern central Portugal, the Paesuri comprised four subtribes ‚Äì Ireucutiori, Aravoni, Seareae and Paesicaeci or Paesici ‚Äì which settled the mountains of Freita, Arada, and the northern slopes of Caramulo around the 5th Century BC. History Like their neighbours the Turduli Veteres and Gallaeci, the Paesuri did not fall under Carthaginian rule at the later 3rd Century BC and appear to have not taken part in the 2nd Punic War. It is still not clear if they played any significant role in the Lusitanian Wars of the 2nd century BC. Allied with the Lusitani, they bore the brunt of the first Roman thrusts into the Iberian northwest.

Chester and Frank Bevis, directed by Jacques Tourneur and starring Dana Andrews, Peggy Cummins and Niall MacGinnis. It is adapted from the M. R. James story \\"Casting the Runes\\" (1911). The film's storyline concerns an American psychologist who travels to England to investigate a satanic cult suspected in more than one death. The production was turbulent due to artistic differences that arose between producer Hal E. Chester on one side and director Tourneur and writer Charles Bennett on the other. The original plan was not to show the demon on screen, but Chester inserted a special effects creature over the objections of the writer, the director and lead actor Dana Andrews. To accelerate the pace, the 95 minute British feature was trimmed down to 83 minutes and retitled Curse of the Demon for the US market, playing there in June 1958 as the second half of a double feature with either The True Story of Lynn Stuart or The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), depending on the local film market.Warren, Bill (1986). \\"Keep Watching The Skies Volume 2\\". McFarland & Co., Inc. . Page 776 Plot In England, Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) begs his rival, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis), to rescind the curse he inflicted on Harrington; in return, Harrington will cease his investigation into Karswell's Satanic cult. After learning that a parchment he gave Harrington has been destroyed, Karswell ushers him out and promises to do what he can. As Harrington arrives home, he perceives a gigantic demon materializing in the trees. Harrington tries to escape in his car but crashes into power lines. The authorities declare electrocution as the cause of death. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in Britain to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. He is informed that the only link between Harrington's death and Karswell's cult is a man suspected of murder, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Holden meets Karswell at the Reading Room of the British Museum. When a rare book that Holden requests goes missing, Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins). She gives him Harrington's diary, which details Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. When a very strong windstorm abruptly starts, Karswell claims to have created it with a spell. When Holden mocks him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days. Holden and his colleagues discuss Karswell and make plans to further examine Rand Hobart. Then Holden goes to dinner with Joanna and she shows him her uncle's diary. Harrington's diary mentions a parchment with runic writing on it that was passed to him by Karswell, and Holden finds a similar parchment that Karswell secretly passed to him at the library. A powerful wind comes through the window, blowing the parchment from his fingers towards the fireplace, only to be stopped by the fire guard. Holden then recovers and pockets it. Holden begins to feel more uneasy after a visit to Hobart's family to seek permission to hypnotise Hobart and find out about the death he is suspected of. The mother gives her consent but says that the family are 'believers.' As Holden leaves, the parchment is blown from his hand again. Hobart's family becomes fearful and declares Holden to be \\"chosen.\\" Later, Holden compares the parchment's runes to ones inscribed on the nearby stone circle at Stonehenge. Joanna takes Holden to a s√©ance at the invitation of Karswell's mother (Athene Seyler). The male medium claims to channel Harrington, who tells them that Karswell has the key to reading the runes in his copy of the rare book, but Holden abruptly exits, saying it is all nonsense. After they leave, Joanna says she intends to search for the book's key and they drive to Karswell's mansion. There, Holden insists he will break into the house while she waits outside. Entering through an open window, he is attacked by a cat that seems to morph into a panther. Holden is rescued by Karswell entering and switching on the light, saying he knew Holden would come. Against Karwell's warning, Holden leaves through the woods, as he had arrived, and believes he is chased by a mysterious cloud of smoke and fire before escaping. He and Joanna report the events to the police, but he feels embarrassed by their scepticism and leaves. Under hypnosis, the suspect Hobart reveals to Holden that he was \\"chosen\\" to die by having a runic parchment passed to him, but avoided death by passing it back to the person who had given it to him. When Holden shows Hobart the parchment he had received from Karswell, Hobart thinks he is trying to give it to him. He goes berserk and jumps out of a window to his death. Holden learns Karswell is taking a train to Southampton, and on the train discovers that he has kidnapped and hypnotised Joanna. As the time for Holden's predicted death draws near, Karswell becomes agitated, and when the train stops at the next station, he tries to leave. Holden manages to sneak the parchment into his coat pocket, but when Karswell retrieves it, it flies from his hand. He chases it down the tracks, but as he reaches it the parchment combusts. As an oncoming train approaches, the demon manifests and violently attacks Karswell. When his corpse is found by the tracks, the police believe that he was struck and dragged by the train. Holden is shaken and, instead of going to inspect the body, accepts Joanna's advice that \\"it's better not to know,\\" and they leave together.

He sold his script to independent producer and former child actor Hal E. Chester shortly before going to America. Bennett later regretted selling the script, because on arrival in America he was approached by RKO, who wanted to purchase it and allow Bennett to direct the film. Actors Robert Taylor and Dick Powell had been in line for the leading roles if this production had taken place.Peary, 1989 Jacques Tourneur was brought in by Chester on the recommendation of Ted Richmond, the producer of Tourneur's previous film, Nightfall (1957).Fujiwara 1998, pp. 242‚Äì246 However, Tourneur and Chester had serious disagreements during filming. One argument was about the wind scene; Tourneur tried to convince Chester to replace two electric fans with two aeroplane engines. When Chester hesitated, star Dana Andrews threatened to leave the picture if Chester did not let \\"the director direct the picture\\". Locations for the film include Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire (as Lufford Hall), Stonehenge, Bricket Wood railway station and the Reading Room of the British Museum. After completion of the principal shooting, producer Chester decided to show the demon at the beginning and end of the film. Tourneur later said that he was against the addition: \\"The scenes where you see the demon were shot without me...the audience should never have been completely certain of having seen the demon\\". Stop motion master Ray Harryhausen was requested by Columbia Pictures to create the demon for the production, but he was already committed to his Dynamation film The 7th Voyage of Sinbad with producer Charles H. Schneer. Author Tony Earnshaw's book Beating the Devil: The Making of Night of the Demon argues that showing the demon was planned early on in the production (despite Tourneur's protests to the contrary), in order to heighten the tension in the film by letting the audience know the demonic powers were real. Bennett, also angry at the script changes, said \\"If [Chester] walked up my driveway right now, I'd shoot him dead\\".Jeff Stafford. \\"Curse of the Demon (1958) Articles\\" tcm.com.

A Blu-ray edition from Powerhouse Films' Indicator label, featuring four different cuts of the film, was released as a UK all-region release on 22 October 2018.Powerhouse Films Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin commented that Tourneur's direction was \\"handled with much of the assurance the same director brought to Cat People\\" and that the film was \\"way above average\\". The review commented on the image of the demon, stating whenever the demon takes on a visible form, \\"especially the ending\\", it seemed more like a product of \\"a child's nightmare than an adult's imagination\\". In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Night of the Demon placed at number 52 on their top 100 list. Director Martin Scorsese placed Night of the Demon on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%, based on , with an overall weighted average rating of 8.2/10.

The Sunheri Mosque (, or Golden Mosque), also known as the Talai Mosque, is a late Mughal architecture-era mosque in the Walled City of Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. Location Sunehri Mosque is located in the Walled City of Lahore. History Unlike the Wazir Khan Mosque and Badshahi Mosque which were built at the zenith of the Mughal Empire in the 17th century, the Sunehri Mosque was built in 1753 when the empire was in decline. The architect of the mosque was Nawab Bukhari Khan, deputy governor of Lahore during the reign of Muhammad Shah.Lahore, 'Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, (Routledge, 1996), 159. Local shopkeeper had objected to the construction of a large mosque in a congested area, so Bukhari Khan acquired a fatwa from local religious leaders in order for construction to begin. =Sikh Rule= During Sikh rule, the mosque was seized by Sikh authorities and converted into a gurdwara, after a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was installed in the mosque following Sikhs complaints that the Muslim call to prayer from the mosque was disturbing their religious ceremonies at a newly constructed baoli (stepped well) nearby. The mosque was restored in the late 1820s after Fakir Azizuddin persuaded Ranjit Singh to transfer ownership back to the Muslim community. The Muslim community was required to reduce the volume of the call to prayer, and forfeited rent from the leasing of shopfronts. Architecture A view of the prayer hall from the mosque's inner courtyard The mosque was built on a plinth elevated 11 feet off of the bazaars surface, with shops occupying the ground floor beneath the mosque. The shops rents were used to pay for the mosque's upkeep. The architectural style of the mosque reflects influences of Sikh architecture from nearby Amritsar. The staircase in front of the mosque has 16 steps, and opens up to a small courtyard measuring 65 feet by 43 feet. An ablution tank is in the centre of this courtyard. The prayer chamber measures 40 feet long, and 16 feet wide. The mosque has a gateway, which measures 21.3 metres in length and a courtyard that measures . The marble domes cover seven prayer chambers. Four lofty minarets stand at the four corners of the mosque, each with an outer circumference of , soaring up to . Conservation In 2011, the Government of Punjab began a project to restore the mosque with funding from the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the United States of America. Minarets were resurfaced while the domes were re-gilded, while new marble floors were installed.

The group came together from the firing of Crush and Savio Vega from the Nation of Domination stable in June 1997 and consisted of four main members: Crush, Chainz, Skull and 8-Ball. History DOA began to form on the June 9, 1997 edition of Raw is War when, the leader of the Nation of Domination, Faarooq fired both Savio Vega and Crush from the stable. As a result, Crush proceeded to form his own Hells Angels-themed stable. The group consisted of Chainz, Skull and 8-Ball (both of whom are real-life cousins of Chainz). They were introduced on the June 23, 1997 edition of Raw is War and proceeded to feud with the new Nation of Domination led by Faarooq and Los Boricuas led by Savio Vega. Late in 1997, Crush left the group, and the WWF in protest of the Montreal Screwjob, and believing he would fare better in WCW. The WWF addressed this by saying Crush was Kayfabe put out of action by Kane. DOA continued as a stable with Chainz assuming leadership. With the loss of Crush, DOA started to team on a semi-regular basis with Ken Shamrock and Ahmed Johnson to battle The Nation of Domination. They also feuded against the Truth Commission and their spiritual leader, The Jackyl. During this time, DOA would make their ring entrances astride custom-made Titan Motorcycles. As time passed, Skull and 8-Ball began to focus on their tag team career, leaving Chainz to compete as a singles wrestler. In June 1998, Chainz left the WWF, and Skull and 8-Ball continued as a tag team using the DOA name. They entered a feud with The Legion of Doom and Droz, during the course of which the Legion's former manager Paul Ellering turned on his former charges and sided with DOA. However, that angle soon died out and DOA entered a brief feud with Southern Justice. Soon after that, Ellering left the duo and they formed a short lived alliance with Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor known then as Too Much. Their last match in WWF as a tag team was a defeat to Ken Shamrock and Mankind on May 14, 1999 at a house show. Soon after that angle, DOA left the WWF later in May 1999. Then, both 8-Ball and Skull went to WCW.

Character Story was a staunch supporter of his Church, and had little sympathy for schemes of reunion with the other Presbyterian communities. He vigorously opposed the action of Bishop Welldon, then metropolitan of Calcutta, in excluding Scottish chaplains and troops from the use of garrison churches in India because these had received episcopal consecration. He was characterized by an absolutely fearless honesty, which sometimes gave offence, but at the basis of his nature there was a warm, tender and sympathetic heart, incapable of meanness or intrigue.

He served in the Norwegian government from 2005 to 2012 as Minister of International Development and Minister of the Environment, and as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme from 2016 to 2018. Solheim is a member of the Green Party. Solheim was formerly a politician for the Socialist Left Party (SV); he led its youth branch, the Socialist Youth, from 1977 to 1981, was party secretary from 1981 to 1985, and served as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1989 to 2001. He was leader of the Socialist Left Party from 1987 to 1997. During Solheim's tenure as party leader the party moved closer to the centre and abandoned many former hard-left stances. Within the party, Solheim was considered part of the right wing, and his reforms made him strongly unpopular on the left wing of his own party. In 2000 Solheim left Norwegian politics to take up an appointment as a special adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs working as a participant in the Norwegian delegation that unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the Sri Lankan Civil War before the outbreak of Eelam War IV. Solheim returned to Norwegian politics in 2005 when he was appointed Minister of International Development. In 2007 he additionally became the Minister of the Environment, and he held both offices until 2012. After leaving the government in 2012, he returned to his previous position as a special adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from 2013 to 2016 Solheim was Chair of the OECD Development Assistance Committee in Paris. He was Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme from 2016 to 2018. In November 2018 he stepped down following an internal UN audit that criticized his frequent international travel and some internal rule breaking. Since he left the government, Solheim sometimes made critical remarks about the Socialist Left Party. Solheim later expressed his support for the centrist Green Party and was active as a strategic adviser for the party during the 2015 elections. He became a member of the Green Party in 2019.Erik Solheim: ‚Äì Norge trenger et gr√∏nt folkeparti Biography Born in Oslo, Solheim attended high school at Oslo Cathedral School and, after serving conscription for the Norwegian Air Force in Bod√∏ (1974‚Äì75), graduated from the University of Oslo in 1980 with a cand.mag. degree after studying history, sociology and political science. After 11 years in parliament he worked for five years for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs before being appointed Minister. Norwegian politics Solheim was the leader of Socialist Youth 1977‚Äì1980 and party secretary of the Socialist Left Party 1981‚Äì1985. In 1987, he became leader of the Socialist Left Party and rose quickly to become a popular figure in Norwegian politics. In the 1989 election he was elected to Parliament from S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag in what was to then SVs best election, but was the following two elections (in 1993 and 1997 Solheim was elected from Oslo). He was controversial within his own party because he was considered to be too right- wing. In 1997, after ten years as party leader, he stepped down and was succeeded by Kristin Halvorsen. Through the 1990s Solheim became one of the most prominent figures in Norwegian politics, and lead his party through a period of rising popularity. In later years he has received criticism from some older party colleagues for moderating his views on the European Union and becoming a supporter of Norway's membership in NATO. Solheim was appointed Minister of International Development on 17 October 2005 as part of Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet, the first time Solheim's party sat in the Cabinet. On 18 October 2007, he was also appointed Minister of the Environment. He held both posts until 23 March 2012, when he was‚Äîagainst his own wish‚Äîmoved by newly appointed party leader Audun Lysbakken. International peace maker =2002 Truce in Sri Lanka= From the spring of 2000 he was granted a leave of absence from parliament to serve as special advisor to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka. He went on to become one of the most recognizable figures in the peace negotiations between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers. Solheim helped negotiate a truce in 2002.Envoy issues Sri Lanka peace call BBC News On 17 October 2005, he continued his engagement with international affairs when he was appointed Minister of International Development in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. In this position, he was able to continue his work on the Sri Lanka issue. =Post 2006 activities= Solheim met with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister and U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns on 23 January 2006. After meeting with the officials, Solheim told journalists in Colombo, \\"Everyone is worried with the present deteriorating security situation. It is hard to see the present situation continuing indefinitely. Sri Lanka is at a crossroads.\\" After meeting with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse, Undersecretary Burns expressed hope that \\"the LTTE understands that it will have no relations with my country, and for that matter any effective relations with any country in the world, on the barrel of the gun.\\" President Rajapakse and Solheim met the day after. Solheim then went north and met with Tamil Tiger rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham. Dumeetha Luthra of BBC News said Solheim's visit was seen as crucial to saving the truce. 2006 peace talks Solheim announced on 12 September 2006 that the Government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers had agreed to hold \\"unconditional peace talks\\" in October in Oslo.Sri Lanka, Tamil Tigers agree to hold peace talks Todayonline Solheim told BBC News officials that \\"Both parties have expressed willingness to come back to the table. We expect the violence will be stopped. The government has throughout its existence for 10 months repeatedly told us that they are ready for talks without any preconditions and the LTTE has today confirmed that they are ready for talks without any preconditions.\\" Government reaction Keheliya Rambukwella, a spokesman for the Sri Lankan government, acknowledged that the government was ready for talks, \\"but we did not agree on Oslo for unconditional peace talks.\\" Officials from the European Union, Japan, Norway and the United States, meeting in Brussels to discuss the conflict, released a statement in support of the peace talks.Sri Lankan foes 'to talk peace' BBC News Government spokesman Rambukwella denied that the government agreed to unconditional negotiations, saying, \\"We will put forward our conditions.\\" Rambukwella criticized the Norwegian government for announcing the talks without consulting the Sri Lankan government: \\"The government has not been consulted on any future discussions. Norway, or anybody, can't announce dates and venues. We will take it up very seriously. We are a sovereign state. They are only facilitators. We have not delegated any of our powers to them.\\"Sri Lanka denies 'unconditional' talks with Tigers TamilNet The Sri Lankan Government's chief negotiator, Nimal Siripala De Silva, filed an official complaint about Solheim's announcement to the press to Norwegian Ambassador Hans Brattskar when they met, along with Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary S. Palihakkara and Norwegian Embassy spokesman Eric Nurnberg, at the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. Minister De Silva said he hoped to discuss the \\"future role of the international community in the Sri Lankan Peace Process and the future course of action on the peace front\\" at this meeting.Co-Chairs announcement: Government complains Daily News He also expressed a desire for a \\"sincere commitment to the process from the LTTE leader Prabakaran\\" to reporters.Sri Lankan gov't calls for sincere rebel commitment for peace People's Daily Online =Aftermath= His attempts of peacemaking were in the end unsuccessful, with the Asian Tribune concluding that \\"his handling relationship with Sri Lanka\\" was an \\"utter failure\\". In 2010, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St√∏re thus instead took control over the bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Norway, with Eva Kristin Hansen stating that \\"Norway will ensure that Norway-Sri Lanka relations are brought back to the way they were.\\" In January 2011 Erik Solheim offered to play the role of a \\"dialogue partner\\" between the Sri Lankan government and communities living in exile, possibly a reference to the Tamil Diaspora or the LTTE supporters who have formed a government in exile. In an interview with journalists Easwaran Rutnam and Jamila Najmuddin, the Norwegian Minister of Environment, who has been often labelled in Sri Lanka as being pro-LTTE, said that the recent Wikileaks reports on him proved that he was not biased towards one party. Solheim also rejected the idea of a separate State in Sri Lanka and urged the Tamil Diaspora to seek dialogue and work through democratic means to achieve their goals. The LTTE had recently created a government in exile, also known as the Transnational government of Tamil Ealam which demands for a separate State and obtained the support of the Tamil Diaspora especially those living in Canada. Controversies =Sri Lanka exchange of gifts= In an interview with Sri Lanka's Daily News, Colonel Karuna, a former LTTE regional commander and a current member of the Sri Lankan parliament, levelled claims of Norwegian support for the LTTE and the existence of an exchange of goods, including gifts such as TVs and large sums of money existed between Solheim and LTTE leadership. Solheim has denied the allegations made against him and has complained that these accusations are the fabrications of the media. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they are surprised about the \\"obvious lies about Mr. Solheim\\". also stating that there is \\"no basis in reality\\" for the accusations. In an open letter to the editor of the Sunday Times newspaper, in reply to an article published on 15 April 2007, the Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Hans Brattskar, also \\"categorically refuted allegations made by a Norwegian national, who happened to be a convicted murderer and his organization Norwegians Against Terrorism, to the effect that Norway has funded terrorism.\\" also stating that \\"Unfortunately, similar allegations based on the very same source, have lately also been published and broadcast by other parts of the Sri Lankan media.\\" \\"Norwegians Against Terrorism\\" is a one-man band led by convicted murderer Falk Rune Rovik.Norway dismisses allegations, BBCSinhala.com 18 April 2007Ex-convict causing trouble, Aftenposten 19 April 2007 Rovik also posted a video of LTTE leadership visiting the Norwegian Special Forces Training Camp in Rena, which showed the LTTE receiving instruction on their weapons, tactics and military strategies. The content or authenticity of this video was never refuted by Solheim or the Norwegian government. In May 2011, Aftenposten stated that Norwegian Embassy personnel in Colombo had secretly helped LTTE personnel to leave Sri Lanka. This practice was defended by Erik Solheim, who stated that Norway had a long tradition of helping people at risk. =Commercial and Chinese promotion= Before being asked to resign as head of UNEP, Solheim was criticized for his promotion of a vast and environmentally controversial Chinese infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as Chinese investments in Africa. Solheim defended himself against accusations of nepotism and conflict of interest. Deutsche Welle editorialized that \\"his actions paint a questionable picture of a corrupt politician using a position of privilege to his own advantage.\\" Work in intergovernmental organisations =OECD= In January 2013, Erik Solheim was appointed head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (DAC). He took over from Brian Atwood who stepped down in December 2012. The DAC is an international forum for bilateral providers of development co-operation. It aims to promote development co-operation in order to contribute to sustainable development. Solheim focussed on reform of official development assistance, providing more support to the least developed countries. He has also sought to blend development assistance with private investment and better taxation systems in recipient countries. =UNEP= In May 2016, Solheim was appointed Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. He succeeded Achim Steiner in that post in June 2016. A 2018 internal audit by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) questioned Solheim's ability to lead the UNEP, particularly in light of his \\"extensive travel patterns\\" and general management style.Damian Carrington (27 September 2018), Under-fire UN environment chief forced back to HQ The Guardian. As a consequence, the governments of Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands halted their funding to UNEP, leaving the organisation facing a major funding crisis.Damian Carrington (25 September 2018), Nations halt funding to UN environment programme as outcry over chief grows The Guardian.

It is intended for testing, debugging, and measurement purposes. The protocol is rarely used, as its design flaws allow ready misuse. A host may connect to a server that supports the Character Generator Protocol on either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number 19. Upon opening a TCP connection, the server starts sending arbitrary characters to the connecting host and continues until the host closes the connection. In the UDP implementation of the protocol, the server sends a UDP datagram containing a random number (between 0 and 512) of characters every time it receives a datagram from the connecting host. Any data received by the server is discarded. Inetd implementation On most Unix-like operating systems, a CHARGEN server is built into the inetd or xinetd daemon. The CHARGEN service is usually not enabled by default. It may be enabled by adding the following lines to the file and telling inetd to reload its configuration: chargen stream tcp nowait root internal chargen dgram udp wait root internal Applications The CHARGEN service may be used as a source of a byte-stream for debugging TCP network code for proper bounds checking and buffer management. It may also be a source of generic payload for bandwidth measurement and/or QoS fine-tuning. Although consideration must be given if hardware compression is active, as the output from the CHARGEN service is easily and efficiently compressed. This compression can cause bandwidth tests to report the size of the data after decompression, instead of the actual amount of data which passed the wire. Sample session A typical CHARGEN service session looks like this: The user connects to the host using a telnet client. The user receives a stream of bytes. Although the specific format of the output is not prescribed by , the recommended pattern (and a de facto standard) is shifted lines of 72 ASCII characters repeating. $ telnet localhost chargen Trying 127.0.0.1...

This continues until the TCP connection is closed as shown in the trace by ending the telnet session. Abuse The service was used maliciously to crash Microsoft domain name servers (DNS) running Windows NT 4.0 by piping the arbitrary characters straight into the DNS server listening port (telnet ntbox 19  telnet ntbox 53). However, the attack may have been a symptom of improper buffer management on the part of Microsoft's DNS service and not directly related to the CHARGEN service. UDP CHARGEN is commonly used in denial-of- service attacks. By using a fake source address the attacker can send bounce traffic off a UDP CHARGEN application to the victim. UDP CHARGEN sends 200 to 1,000 times more data than it receives, depending upon the implementation. This \\"traffic multiplication\\" is also attractive to an attacker because it obscures the attacker's IP address from the victim. CHARGEN was widely implemented on network-connected printers. As printer firmware was rarely updated on older models before CHARGEN and other security concerns were known, there may still be many network-connected printers which implement the protocol. Where these are visible to the Internet, they are invariably misused as denial of service vectors. Potential attackers often scan networks looking for UDP port 19 CHARGEN sources. So notorious is the availability of CHARGEN in printers that some distributed denial of service trojans now use UDP port 19 for their attack traffic. The supposed aim is to throw investigators off the track; to have them looking for old printers rather than subverted computers.

The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the superhero Spider-Man, and the son of Spencer Smythe. After his father dedicated his life to eliminating Spider-Man and died as a result, Alistair inherited his Spider-Slayer legacy and developed a hatred for the web-slinger. He turned to a life of crime to exact revenge on Spider-Man, and created a new generation of Spider-Slayers to kill him, but this only resulted in Alistair getting paralyzed from the waist down. Later, he encased his body in a bioorganic carapace that allowed him to walk again, in addition to giving him superpowers, and adopted the alias of the Ultimate Spider-Slayer. The character has been adapted from the comics into several forms of media, including animated series and video games. Actor B.J. Novak played Alistair Smythe in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. IGN ranked him as Spider- Man's 9th greatest enemy. Publication history Alistair Smythe first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #19 (November 1985), and was created by Louise Simonson and Mary Wilshire. He died in The Superior Spider-Man #13 (September 2013). Fictional character biography The Spider-Slayers were a series of robots that sought to destroy Spider-Man. The initial generation of Spider-Slayers were created by his father Spencer Smythe. After Spencer failed to kill Spider-Man‚Äîand ended up dying as a result of prolonged exposure to the radioactive samples involved‚ÄîAlistair inherited his father's legacy and gained a new-found hatred toward Spider-Man. His initial attempt, however, failed when, in a rather humorous misunderstanding, he mistook Mary Jane Watson for Spider-Man; playing along with it to give Peter Parker time to come up with a plan while Mary Jane used a super-powered suit designed by aliens) until he was defeated by the real wall-crawler. He initially worked for the Kingpin but left in disagreement over how to deal with Spider-Man and went solo.Amazing Spider-Man Annual 19 After being confined in an asylum, Alistair released himself and took several other inmates with him in order to construct a new series of Spider-Slayers that tracked Spider-Man across the city. With a plan of revenge, he forced the inmates to assist him in the machines' construction. After sending a series of slayers after Spider-Man (and all of their inevitable destruction with assistance from others including Scorpion and the Black Cat), Alistair lured Spider-Man to his residence for one final battle. In order to defeat Spider-Man on his own, Alistair enhanced himself by encasing his entire body in a bioorganic carapace that not only served as a full body armour, but increased his strength and gave him the ability to walk again by interconnecting with his spine. The physical structure of the carapace gave Alistair bird-like talons for feet; a long, curved blade-like weapon jutting from each shoulder; a pair of smaller, jagged blade weapons on each forearm; and a specially made web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. Eventually, Spider-Man defeated Alistair and made sure he'd been taken to custody as well as the other asylum inmates who survived the ordeal.Amazing Spider-Man #368-373 During Scarlet Spider's brief stint as sole web-slinger in town, Smythe (still carapaced as the Ultimate Spider-Slayer) started a war utilizing a new set of slayers he intended to sell on the black market. These Cyber-Slayers, which could be controlled remotely by turning one's thoughts into the slayers' actions, were initially targeted at Lady Octopus and her crew.Web of Scarlet Spider #2 The Scarlet Spider ended up in the middle of things and temporarily allied with the Cyber-Slayers, a fact that did not go over well with Smythe.The Spectacular Scarlet Spider #2 Smythe, no longer in his carapace but with his ability to walk restored by his earlier use of it, found his way outside prison and sought revenge on both Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson for the death of his father. He coerced Jameson to alter the stories in the Daily Bugle or else he'd kill his wife and son John Jameson. Once Spider-Man caught on to Smythe's trail, he followed it back to the Bugle where Smythe assaulted him with recreated versions of every spider-slayer ever sent after Spider-Man in the past plus a pair of new creations‚Äîa miniature model designed to latch onto Spider-Man's face and penetrate his mind through use of radiation and a larger six-armed model arguably stronger than any other created. While attached to Spider-Man's head, the miniature spider-slayer psionically connected to Spidey's mind, copied thoughts of his loved ones, and broadcast that information to all the other mini-slayers. Smythe gave Spider- Man the choice of either stopping them or preventing the six-armed slayer from destroying Jameson. Spider-Man eventually shut down all the spider-slayers at the same time, but it was Jameson who beat Smythe to the verge of death with a baseball bat for threatening his family. Smythe made another return in which he used a poisonous spider he made and attacked John Jameson and caused him to end up in the hospital.The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2 #20-21 During the \\"Big Time\\" storyline, Alistair Smythe returns with a new metallic body armor and is hunting down all of J. Jonah Jameson's friends and family. He decides to seek out Mac Gargan for help, who is currently locked away in jail.Amazing Spider- Man #648 Posing as a scientist, Smythe infiltrates the Raft and makes off with Gargan.Amazing Spider-Man #650 He then performs a cybernetic operation on him, turning him into a cyborg Scorpion, and convinces him to join his crusade against Jameson. At this point, Smythe has amassed a small army of cyborg minions, all of whom want revenge on Jameson.Amazing Spider-Man #651 Smythe, Scorpion, and a new villain named Fly-Girl lead their army to attack the site of John Jameson's latest space mission, sabotaging the launch and holding John for ransom.Amazing Spider-Man #652 Smythe's new plan was to kill all those close to Jameson, but not to kill Jameson himself so Jameson could feel the same suffering that he did losing his father. Smythe's actions get Jameson's wife Dr. Marla Jameson killed, as well as seemingly permanently negating Spider-Man's spider-sense when a device Spider-Man designed to overload a link between Smythe's current Slayers also damaged his spider-sense.Amazing Spider- Man #654 J. Jonah Jameson plans to have the death penalty given to Alistair Smythe for what happened to Marla.Amazing Spider-Man #656 During the \\"Spider- Island\\" storyline, J. Jonah Jameson brings Alistair Smythe from Ryker's Island to demand his help in resolving the spider-flu plague transforming ordinary citizens into Homo Archanis. Alistair Smythe laughed at the irony of how Jameson has gained spider powers. At the moment, Jameson transforms and seriously wounds Smythe by biting a chunk out of his neck.Amazing Spider-Man #670 Despite his injuries, Alistair Smythe is seen alive and well as a prisoner in the Raft.Amazing Spider-Man #691 Alistair Smythe is a witness of the escape of Doctor Octopus (who has secretly swapped his mind with Spider- Man) and is denied to join up with him.Amazing Spider-Man #699 Mayor J. Jonah Jameson later calls in the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body, who has become a hero) to help oversee the execution of Alistair Smythe and ensure that he does not escape. Smythe tries to taunt the Superior Spider- Man by mentioning Marla Jameson's death, but he brushes him off. Mayor Jameson and Superior Spider-Man, alongside Jameson's assistant Glory Grant, and Daily Bugle reporter Norah Jones watch the procedure of Smythe's execution while he claims to be a \\"better person\\". The Superior Spider-Man tries to reply that no one would buy that, only to stop himself once he remembers that he just pulled that trick. Just as Smythe's execution begins, a swarm of mini Spider-Slayers attack the place allowing Smythe to move freely. However, they are counteracted by Otto's Spider-Bots. Smythe attempts to escape, but he finds out that Otto has prepared himself for every method of escape he may try, prompting Smythe to shift his plan to kill Spider-Man for which he was also prepared. The mini Spider-Slayers enter the infirmary where they surround Boomerang, Vulture, and Scorpion. The mini Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them where they get one request from Smythe to kill Superior Spider-Man.The Superior Spider-Man #11 Superior Spider-Man is seen fighting Smythe and is mocking him for being weak in comparison to his father Spencer Smythe. When Superior Spider-Man says that he has called the Avengers for backup, Smythe states that he has his own backup as Boomerang, Scorpion, and Vulture show up. Superior Spider-Man admits that the Mini-Slayers were clever but inadvertently reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators distracting him at the revelation. Smythe takes the upper hand until he is narrowly shot down by Mayor Jameson disguised as a Raft guard. Superior Spider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies (all heading for a full front assault against Superior Spider-Man) who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he has out. All of them agree that even though that might happen, they will make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the Lizard to escape. Once Smythe tries to escape, Superior Spider-Man reminds him about the emergency generators. Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that just like he does with his Spider-Bots, he can see through his Mini-Slayers catching up on Mayor Jameson and the trapped civilians sending their locations to the group. Scorpion rejects it at first, but is easily convinced once Smythe tells him that one of his targets is Mayor Jameson himself. After Boomerang is defeated, Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that he is still caught in a predicament since Scorpion is heading to his personal vengeance against Jameson and Vulture is ready to kill the group of civilians so he must make a choice only to be surprised when Superior Spider-Man replies that he will not follow any of them. Instead, Superior Spider-Man determined to complete his mission of slaying him.The Superior Spider-Man #12 Superior Spider-Man succeeds in killing Smythe, but only his physical body, as his robotic components keep his mind intact. Smythe then tries to transfer his mind into Superior Spider-Man's body, but since Otto his corpse, with his mind intact, attacks the survivors, disarming the guards. Superior Spider-Man tackles Smythe and they fall onto the shore below, Smythe attempts to transfer his mind into Superior Spider-Man, however, Superior Spider-Man had already done this and equipped the mask with armored plating. Before Alistair dies, Superior Spider-Man taunts him by revealing being Otto and that Otto already beat the true Spider-Man to the mind transfer. His body is presumably carried away.The Superior Spider-Man #13 During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Doctor Octopus' conscious in an Octobot infiltrates New U Technologies and finds that the Jackal has obtained the body of Alistair.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #20 Jackal managed to make a clone of Alistair alongside his father.Clone Conspiracy #2 Powers and abilities Alistair Smythe is a scientific genius specializing in robotics, cybernetics and genetics. His most notable inventions are the Spider-Slayers, robots built for the express purpose of capturing or killing Spider-Man. Though the creation and idea for these originally came from his father, Alistair has made advances and improvements on the originals and current generations are extremely sophisticated and formidable. The Spider-Slayers often operate in groups and Alistair is tactically skilled in his deployment of them. Smythe later invented a bio-organic carapace that serves as a full body armor. It gives him increased strength and the ability to walk again by interfacing with his spine. The carapace has bird-like talons for feet, a long, curved bladed weapon jutting from each shoulder and smaller, jagged blades on each forearm. It also has web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. While wearing this armor, Smythe has superhuman strength, durability, speed and agility. Other versions =House of M= In the House of M reality, a furious J. Jonah Jameson hired Alistair Smythe, an associate of Norman Osborn, to build a Spider-Slayer to get revenge against the Parkers.Spider-Man: House of M #3 In other media =Television= * Alistair Smythe appeared in the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Maxwell Caulfield. In this version, he was crippled after a lab accident while helping his father with his work. Blaming himself for what happened, Spencer agrees to capture Spider-Man for Norman Osborn in exchange for Osborn building a hoverchair for Alistair. After witnessing his father's failed attempt to eliminate Spider-Man and apparent death, Alistair begins working for the Kingpin and builds several Spider- Slayers for him while seeking revenge against Spider-Man, whom he blames for Spencer's death. However, after failing the crime lord several times, as well as being partially responsible for his son, Richard Fisk's, arrest, Alistair begins to fear for his life and plans to sell out the Kingpin, but is caught in the act. He is then turned against his will into the Ultimate Spider-Slayer cyborg by his replacement, Herbert Landon, via genetic manipulation. Following his transformation, Alistair became strong enough to overpower and outperform Spider-Man. However, he eventually breaks free of the Kingpin's programming with Spider-Man's help, and discovers his father's preserved body. Alistair then works for several resourceful individuals, such as Silvermane and Miles Warren, in exchange for his father's revival. In the series' three-part adaptation of Secret Wars, Alistair is among several supervillains transported to an alien planet by the Beyonder to fight a team of heroes led by Spider- Man, and is ultimately defeated and returned to Earth with no memory of the event. ** An alternate reality version of Alistair Smythe appeared in the two- part series finale \\"Spider Wars\\", working for the Kingpin and Spider-Carnage to build a mind-control device to take over the world, though the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man ultimately foils them. * A teenage version of Alistair Smythe appears in the 2010s Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Jason Spisak. This version harbors animosity towards Max Modell and has a strained relationship with his father, whose scientific genius he does not respect; instead seeing Norman Osborn as a more accomplished man and wishing to become like him. Introduced in \\"Osborn Academy\\", Alistair is among the students interviewed for a spot in the eponymous school. In \\"Party Animals\\", Alistair controls a Spider-Slayer built by Oscorp using Spencer's stolen schematics and fights Spider-Man. Though the web-slinger destroys it, Osborn informs Alistair he passed the audition. In \\"Symbiotic Relationship\\", Alistair uses upgraded Vulture technology to search for the V-252 at Horizon High, resulting in confrontations with Spider-Man, who bonded with the V-252. After Osborn figures this out, both Alistair and Adrian Toomes use Vulture tech sonic attacks on Spider-Man, leading to Spider-Man removing the V-252 and stealing the container from Osborn. In \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\", Alistair personally operates a mecha Spider-Slayer to capture the Ultimate Spider-Man for Osborn, and battles Spencer in his own mech, as he is also after the same target. The original and Ultimate Spider-Man are eventually able to destroy both mechs, and Spencer is arrested while Alistair escapes to inform Osborn. In \\"The Rise of Doc Ock\\" [Pts. 3 & 4], Alistair dons a Spider-Slayer armor as a member of the Osborn Commandos before they are all placed under Doctor Octopus's control via mind-control technology. In \\"The Hobgoblin\\" [Pt. 1], Doc Ock brainwashes Spider-Man and re-brands the group as the Sinister Six, but they are all eventually freed by Harry Osborn as the Hobgoblin. In \\"Goblin War\\" [Pt. 1], Alistair enrolls at Horizon High and joins the Goblin Nation as a \\"newbie\\" Goblin before being defeated by Spider-Man, Doc Ock, Ghost-Spider, and Spider- Girl. =Film= Alistair Smythe appears in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, portrayed by B.J. Novak. This version is a supervisor at Oscorp who orders Max Dillon to check an electrical fault, which leads to his transformation into Electro. A viral marketing campaign for the film featured a Daily Bugle article which mentions that Alistair replaced his father as the head of Oscorp's engineering division. =Video games= * Alistair Smythe appears as a boss in The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes. * Alistair Smythe appears as a boss in the SNES and Sega Genesis versions of the 1995 Spider-Man video game based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series. * Alistair Smythe appears as the primary antagonist of The Amazing Spider-Man video game, voiced by Nolan North. This version is Oscorp's newest CEO, who pressured the company to invest more heavily in its robotics division and attempted to dispose of the company's cross-species experiments, which were created using the now incarcerated Curt Connors' research. When Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy sneak into Oscorp's restricted areas to investigate rumors about the cross-species, Smythe catches them, but agrees to let them see the experiments anyway, only for them to react to Parker's spider DNA and break free, releasing a deadly virus that infects numerous people, including Smythe. While in quarantine, Smythe dispatches numerous robots to hunt down the cross-species and develops a cure using nanobots; unaware that it will slowly kill the host. After Connors develops a cure, which Spider-Man brings to Oscorp, Smythe steals it with the intent of taking sole credit for it on Oscorp's behalf. However, he becomes paralyzed from the waist down after taking it and is driven insane, sending his robots to eliminate Spider-Man. Upon being fired from Oscorp for his actions, Smythe deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and kidnaps Connors to lure him to Oscorp's robotics facility. While Spider-Man rescues Connors, Smythe captures the former and injects him with his nanobot cure to strip him of his powers before unveiling his biggest creation, the S-03, which he uses to spread the serum throughout the city, wreaking havoc in the process. Spider-Man is able to regain his powers and join forces with the Lizard to defeat Smythe, who regains his sanity and realizes the error of his ways before being left for the police. Following this, Smythe refuses to take the antidote for the cross-species virus, fearing that it does not destroy the virus completely, and escapes from prison. As he approaches the final stages of the infection and regains the use of his legs, Smythe returns to his lab and commands one of his robots to kill him, unwilling to transform into a cross-species. * Alistair Smythe appears in Marvel Heroes. * Alistair Smythe, as the Ultimate Spider-Slayer, appears as a playable character in Spider-Man Unlimited.

At first young Tychyna studied at the district's elementary school which was opened in Pisky in 1897. His first teacher was Serafima Morachevska who later recommended him to try his talent in chorus. In 1900 he became a member of an archiary chorus in the Trinity (Troitsky) monastery near Chernihiv. Simultaneously young Tychyna studied in the Chernihiv theological school. In 1906 Pavlo's father died. In 1907 Pavlo finished his school. In 1907-1913 Tychyna continued his education in the Chernihiv Theological Seminary. There he became friends with the future poet, Vasyl Ellan-Blakytny. He also met Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky who greatly influenced his early works. In 1912-1913 Tychyna's works get published in the various local publications. In 1913-1917 he was studying at the Economics department of the Kiev Commercial Institute which he did not finish. At the same time, he worked on the editorial boards of the Kiev newspaper Rada and the magazine Svitlo (1913‚Äì14). In summers he worked for the Chernihiv statistical bureau. Later he worked as the assistant to chorus-meister in the Mykola Sadovsky theater. When World War I broke out the institute transferred to Saratov. Tychyna, whilst on the road to the institute's new location, became ill and was forced to stop and recover from his sickness. He found sanctuary at the house of another poet, Volodymyr Samiylenko, in Dobrianka. During the war he worked with various Ukrainian publications. In 1920 Pavlo became a member of Pluh. After an immediate success with his poetry, in 1923 he moved to Kharkiv (Kharkov), entering the vibrant world of early post- Revolution Ukrainian literary organizations. In 1923 he joined the organization Hart after moving to Kharkivn and in 1927 the famed VAPLITE. In the 1920s Tychyna was a member of Kharkiv city council as an independent. Controversy about the ideological tendencies of VAPLITE and the content of several of Tychnya's poems led to him being criticized for ideological reasons. As a response, Tychyna stopped writing and everybody assumed that it was the end to his writings. Later he became a member of Chervonyi Shliakh, and started to study Armenian, Georgian, and Turkic language, and became the activist of the Association of Eastern Studies in Kiev. Work His initial work had strong connections to the symbolist literary movement, but his style transformed a number of times during his long career and frequently aped the acceptable socialist realism. His first works exploded onto the avant-garde Ukrainian scene with their colorful imagery and dynamic rhythms. However, as the Communist approach to artistic expression hardened and the role of a state-supported artist became more defined and restricted, Tychyna's poetry shifted rather dramatically, using clear pro-Communist political language, including a famous ode to Joseph Stalin, and the lyrics of the state anthem of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1933 the newspaper Pravda published his poem \\"The Party leads\\" in the Ukrainian language. Tychyna was often criticized by Ukrainian exiles for the praising of Communism in his work and co-option by the regime, but recent scholarship has stressed his subtle distancing and mocking of Communist excesses and brutality through over-the-top suffusive praise. Controversy Tychyna represents a complicated figure in both a political and academic sense. Many Ukrainian exile intellectuals and scholars involved in the analysis of Ukrainian literary history could not accept Tychnya's submission to political authority and apparent abandonment of many of his literary companions to the horrors of Stalinism. The true merit of his later poetry has been difficult to judge in such a bitter environment, which is only now relaxing. It also becomes difficult to determine Tychyna's true intent and emotions in such a repressive environment. Tychnya's willingness to work with authorities, however, did not prevent Soviet authorities from forcing him to write a letter rejecting his candidature for a Nobel Prize, likely due to his Ukrainian heritage.
