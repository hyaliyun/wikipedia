The cases involved claims of Satanic ritual abuse performed by a group of paedophiles, with as many as 60 children testifying they had been abused. At least 36 people were convicted and most of them spent years imprisoned. Thirty-four convictions were reversed by appeal. The district attorney responsible for the convictions was Ed Jagels, who was sued by at least one of those whose conviction was overturned, and who remained in office until 2009. Two of the convicted individuals died in prison, unable to prove their innocence. History During 1982, Alvin and Debbie McCuan's two daughters, coached by their step-grandmother Mary Ann Barbour, who had custody of them, alleged they had been abused by their parents, and accused them of being part of a sex gang that included Scott and Brenda Kniffen. The Kniffens' two sons also claimed to have been abused. No physical evidence was ever found. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted during 1984 and given a combined sentence of more than 1000 years in prison. The convictions were reversed during 1996 and the two couples were released. In 2001, a television movie about the Kniffens titled Just Ask My Children was broadcast on Lifetime. Six similar cases occurred throughout Kern County. For instance, the testimony of five young boys was the prosecution's main evidence in a trial in which four defendants were convicted. John Stoll, a 41-year-old carpenter, received the longest sentence of the group: 40 years for 17 counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. \\"It never happened,\\" Ed Sampley, one of the accusers, told a New York Times reporter in 2004. He claimed he had lied about Stoll. Stoll was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was reversed.Conviction reversed after 19 years, Los Angeles Times, John Johnson, May 1, 2004. Retrieved 11 October 2014. In 2009, Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation.Web.archive.org The county paid nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims. A documentary titled Witch Hunt, which emphasized primarily Stoll's case, was produced and released in 2007. MSNBC also made a documentary concerning John Stoll and the Kern County cases. Sampley and three other former accusers returned in 2004 to the courthouse where they had testified against Stoll, this time to say that Stoll never molested them. In their late 20s, each of them said he always knew the truth‚Äî- that Stoll had never touched them. However, Stoll's son has \\"continued to say that he had been molested.\\" In the case, the only defendant with a previous conviction of molestation was Grant Self, who rented Stoll's pool house briefly. John Stoll had to wait until 2004 for the reversal of his convictions, but was released due to the new testimony. Self was sent to a mental hospital for sexual offenders because he had two prior convictions for child molestation. Self was freed in 2009.Web.archive.org He was re-arrested in 2012 on suspicion of child molestation in Oregon. During July 2013, Self pleaded guilty to sexually abusing three young boys and was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison. Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that emphasized satanic ritual abuse as a major element of child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir Michelle Remembers as training material.Archive.is See also * McMartin preschool trial * Wee Care Nursery School * Fells Acres Day Care Center * Innocence Project * List of miscarriage of justice cases * West Memphis 3 * List of wrongful convictions in the United States References External links * Kern County child abuse cases at the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance Category:Satanic ritual abuse hysteria in the United States Category:History of Kern County, California Category:Day care sexual abuse allegations in the United States Category:Crimes involving Satanism or the occult Category:History of Bakersfield, California Category:Pedophilia in the United States Category:Child sexual abuse in the United States Category:Overturned convictions in the United States Category:1980s in California ","title":"Kern County child abuse cases"},{"id":"915493","text":"The name Robert is an ancient Germanic given name, from Proto-Germanic \\"fame\\" and \\"bright\\" (Hr≈ç√æiberhtaz).

He was a Cabinet minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin, Walter Weir and Sterling Lyon, and was himself leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba (PCs) from 1971 to 1975. Spivak was born to Jewish parents, Malick and Rose Spivak, in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and Harvard University. He worked as a barrister, and also became Vice-President of Golden Age Beverages Limited and Mathers Investments Limited. In 1955, Spivak married Mira Steele; they had three children together. He was named Queen's Counsel in 1966. Spivak was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1966 provincial election, in the southwest Winnipeg riding of River Heights. A Progressive Conservative, Spivak was appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce in Dufferin Roblin's government. He continued to hold this position after Walter Weir became premier in 1967. Weir's Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1969 election, although Spivak was easily re-elected in his own riding. Two years later, he defeated Harry Enns by 46 votes to become the party's leader. Ideologically, Spivak was a Red Tory (on the left of the party). He represented an urban and progressive wing within the party, and did not have the complete confidence of his caucus (which was dominated by more right-wing figures). In the 1973 election, Spivak presented himself as being to the right of Premier Edward Schreyer's New Democrats, but to the left of the Liberals under Israel Asper. He specifically rejected Asper's laissez-faire economic policies, and promised to govern as a centrist. The Progressive Conservatives won 21 seats in the 1973 election, up one from their position at the dissolution of the assembly. Schreyer's New Democrats, however, were re- elected with a majority, and many PC members blamed Spivak for the party's loss. (Some have suggested that the Tory defeat was due in part to anti- Semitism. This interpretation has never been verified, however, and has been rejected by some prominent Jewish figures in Manitoba.) In 1975, former minister Sterling Lyon challenged Spivak for the Progressive Conservative leadership. This challenge was extremely divisive, pitting Spivak's left- leaning ideology against Lyon's conservatism and dividing the PC membership accordingly. There have also been suggestions that some of Lyon's supporters conducted an anti-Semitic \\"whispering campaign\\" against Spivak, suggesting that the party would be unable to form government under a Jewish leader. Lyon, however, had several prominent Jews on his leadership campaign team. When the delegates gathered on December 6, Lyon defeated Spivak by 57 votes. Shortly after the vote, Spivak claimed that the party would have difficulty being elected on a right-wing platform. Lyon led the PCs to victory at the 1977 election, however, and Spivak was appointed as a Minister without Portfolio in the Lyon cabinet (also becoming Co-Chairman of a Task Force on Government Organization and Economy). On October 20, 1978, he became the Minister of Government Services. Spivak resigned from the Manitoba legislature in 1979. He ran for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the federal riding of Winnipeg‚ÄîFort Garry in that year's federal election. He lost to Liberal Lloyd Axworthy, later a high-ranking federal cabinet minister, by 485 out of 45,757 votes. Spivak returned to business after this defeat. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he served as chair of the Canada-Israel Committee; this organization opposed the Oslo Peace Accord of 1993, although Spivak himself was subsequently a promoter of peace in the Middle East. He also served on the Churchill Regional Health Authority Board in the late 1990s. Spivak wanted to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba in 1993 (he would have succeeded George Johnson, his former ministerial colleague in the Roblin and Weir governments), but Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Yvon Dumont instead. He served on the board of governors of the University of Manitoba and on the board of directors for the Saint Boniface Hospital. Sidney Spivak died of a heart attack in Winnipeg in 2002. His widow Mira Spivak was a member of the Senate of Canada from Manitoba from 1986 to 2009.

The round barrows on Wyke Down can be seen in the centre of the photo. The cursus has a slight change of direction as it climbs Bottlebush Down and it is thought that the original terminal of the cursus was at this point (and was later extended another 4.5 km north-east to Martin Down). The Dorset Cursus is a Neolithic cursus monument that spans across 10 km (6¬º miles) of the chalk downland of Cranborne Chase in east Dorset, United Kingdom. Its extreme length makes it a notable example of this class of linear earthwork; it is better interpreted as a pair of same-length cursus constructed end to end, with the more southerly cursus (the Gussage Cursus) pre-dating the northerly one (the Pentridge Cursus). Most of the cursus earthworks have long since been destroyed and its course is only visible as soilmarks when conditions are favourable. Looking southwest from the edge of Salisbury Plantation, the course of the northern bank and ditch is visible as a dark stripe gently meandering down the hillslope (towards the right of this photo). The southern bank is just inside the field boundary (towards the left of the photo). Context Very little remains above ground of the Dorset Cursus, which once stretched for 10 km (6¬º miles) through the undulating chalkland of Cranborne Chase in east Dorset, from Martin Down to Thickthorn Down (both near the A354 road). It is by far the largest example of this class of ancient monument: it is over three times longer than the archetypical Great Cursus near Stonehenge. Most of the current knowledge about the course of this ancient earthwork comes from aerial photography (where its course can be seen as cropmarks or soilmarks) and other geophysical surveying techniques. However, there are a few locations (mentioned below) where the banks, much reduced in size, are still visible; the best-preserved earthworks are those of the southwestern terminal on Thickthorn Down (). This long barrow at is intimately related to the Dorset Cursus, in that it is incorporated into the northern bank. The barrow is very closely aligned with the Cursus (NE-SW) but its greater prominence would have made it clearly distinguishable from the bank. It is suggested that the barrow pre-dates the Cursus, and its direct inclusion into the structure of the Cursus implies a strong connection between the long barrows and the purpose of the Cursus. The Cursus dates from 3300 BCE which makes it contemporary with the earthen long barrows on Cranborne Chase: many of these are found near, on, or within the Cursus and since they are still in existence they help trace the Cursus' course in the modern landscape. The relationship between the Cursus and the alignment of these barrows suggests that they had a common ritual significance to the Neolithic people who spent an estimated 0.5 million worker-hours in its construction. Diagram showing a longitudinal section along the route of the Dorset Cursus. B3081 road. Physical details The Cursus consisted of a pair of parallel banks (1.5 m tall) running about 82 m apart, with external ditches 1.5 m deep and 2 m wide. One bank is regular, whilst the other meanders, suggesting that the former was laid out first and the latter was dug using the former as a reference. The remains of these banks are still visible within Salisbury Plantation on Oakley Down, where a long barrow is built into the northwest bank (). A 250 m length of the south-east bank remains on the northeast-facing slope of Bottlebush Down (, at right angles to the B3081 road). These banks were linked together by cross-banks at the terminals; of these only the southwestern terminal bank on Thickthorn Down remains (), the north-eastern terminal on Martin Down () has been removed by centuries of ploughing. The earthworks of the Cursus' southwestern terminal on Thickthorn Down. The enlarged bank ends can be clearly seen, and the end of the cursus is squared off with a terminal bank about 100 m in length. The course of the Cursus heads off to the right of the photo. The overall orientation of the Cursus is northeast-southwest; it does not follow a perfectly straight line between its terminals, but consists of several straight sections (of varying lengths) with abrupt but small changes in direction. It is believed that the cursus was built in two separate phases. First the southwesterly section from Thickthorn Down to Bottlebush Down, sometimes referred to as the Gussage Cursus. This was later extended another northeast, from Bottlebush Down to the terminal on Martin Down. The quasi- linear course of the Cursus means that it ignores topographical features of the landscape. It is by no means flat, and there is also no overall 'downhill' direction. In fact the vertical profile of the Gussage Cursus is quite symmetric: it has the ridge of Gussage Down in the middle, with river valleys on either side and the terminals near the summits of the neighbouring ridges. The later Pentridge Cursus has one steep valley crossing (between Bottlebush Down and Salisbury Plantation) and beyond that it stops traversing the contours and follows them instead, gently undulating its way towards the terminal on Martin Down. Interpretation In the absence of any evidence for a more mundane purpose, it is assumed that the Cursus served a religious or ceremonial function. There is considerable speculation about the links between the 'ritual landscape' and the course of the Cursus. The Cursus' only significant astronomical alignment is related to its southwesterly orientation: an observer at the Gussage Cursus terminal on Bottlebush Down would see the midwinter sun set behind the long barrow lying across the Cursus on the ridge of Gussage Down. It has been suggested that any processions along the Cursus would take place from the Martin Down terminal in a southwesterly direction for maximum visual impact (of natural and artificial features) along the route. Archaeological excavation of the eastern ditch indicated that it was permitted to silt up rapidly and may therefore have fallen out of use quite soon after being built before being re-appropriated by later peoples. Later Bronze Age sites such as the barrow cemeteries on Oakley and Wyke Downs appear to have respected the presence of the Cursus. This is in contrast to the Roman engineers who built the Ackling Dyke road across middle of the cursus on Wyke Down, and also cut across the barrows in the Oakley Down cemetery.

Romero's Land of the Dead) is a 2005 post-apocalyptic horror film written and directed by George A. Romero; the fourth of Romero's six Living Dead movies, it is preceded by Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, and succeeded by Diary of the Dead and Survival of the Dead. It was released in 2005, with a budget of $15‚Äì19 million, the highest in Romero's Dead series and has grossed $46 million. The story of Land of the Dead deals with a zombie assault on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where a feudal-like government exists. The survivors in the film have fled to the Golden Triangle area of downtown Pittsburgh. The region is protected on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electric barricade that survivors term \\"the Throat\\". Released in North America on June 24, 2005, Land of the Dead received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Plot The living dead continue to hold dominion over the earth but the remnants of human civilization have reorganized enough to establish protected outposts across the United States. One such outpost in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, contains a feudal-like government. Bordered on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electrified fence guarded by a militia, the city has become a sanctuary in which its citizens live in relative security. Outside the city's barriers is a no-man's-land of barren countryside and dilapidated suburban towns long deserted by living humans but overrun with legions of walkers. The rich and powerful live in a luxury high-rise called Fiddler's Green, while the rest of the population subsists in squalor. Paul Kaufman, the city's ruthless plutocratic ruler, has sponsored Dead Reckoning, an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the zombie-infested areas with ease. Riley Denbo is the designer and commander of Dead Reckoning. Unlike Kaufman, Riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens, as well as providing them with food and medical supplies that the citizens can no longer safely acquire themselves. Using Dead Reckoning, Riley and his crew venture into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for supplies. On one mission, they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior. This was especially seen by one such zombie, \\"Big Daddy\\", formerly a gas station attendant. During the mission, rookie Mike is bitten by a zombie and commits suicide before he turns. After the mission, Riley retires from commanding Dead Reckoning. Back in the city, he visits Chihuahua's bar. There, he sees a prostitute named Slack being forced into a cage with some zombies to entertain guests. Riley and Charlie save Slack; Charlie kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos. Riley, Charlie and Slack are arrested. Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution, for helping Mulligan to instigate rebellion among the poor. Meanwhile, Cholo DeMora, Dead Reckonings second in command, is denied an apartment in Fiddler's Green despite his service to Kaufman. In retaliation, Cholo takes over Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green with it. Kaufman approaches Riley and tasks him, as well as Charlie and Slack, to retrieve Dead Reckoning. They are supervised by Manolete, Motown, and Pillsbury. On the way, Manolete is bitten and then killed by Slack. After catching up with Dead Reckoning, Riley approaches the vehicle alone. Charlie, Slack, and Pillsbury follow him after subduing Motown and leaving her behind. Realizing Riley is working for Kaufman, Cholo holds both Riley and Charlie at gunpoint. As he prepares to fire Dead Reckonings missiles at Fiddler's Green, Riley uses a small device and deactivates Dead Reckonings weapons systems; he then destroys the device. Motown, who had regained consciousness, opens fire and nearly kills both Riley and Cholo (who is maimed by one of the gunshots). She is bitten by a zombie and killed by Slack. Riley convinces Cholo to allow him to escape North and to join him, but the latter decides to return to Fiddler's Green to deal with Kaufman; his partner, Foxy accompanies him. While en route, Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman by himself. Riley takes over Dead Reckoning once again and returns to Fiddler's Green. Elsewhere, Big Daddy (who has gathered a large group of zombies) learns that they can walk safely underwater, and leads the zombies across the river to the human city. They take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people. As a result of the zombies making it into the city, the electric fences that once kept the zombies out have now become a wall to trap them and the humans inside. Seeing the city overrun, Kaufman runs with his money, and encounters a zombie Cholo in the parking garage. As the two struggle, Big Daddy kills both with an exploding propane tank. Riley's group arrives at the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but a small group of zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After crossing the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, sparing the surviving humans, Riley decides to leave them alone as well as the zombies do the same, citing that they are just looking for a place to go, too. While lighting up the rest of the fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies, but are now useless since they do not distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.

Romero said in an interview that one of the first potential film studios (20th Century Fox) wanted the film to be titled Night of the Living Dead. He refused, wanting to use the title Dead Reckoning, and the studio then wanted to title it Night of the Living Dead: Dead Reckoning. It turned out that Fox sought to own the rights to the Night of the Living Dead franchise, and Romero decided not to do business with them. The film is the highest budgeted film in the series to date. The film draws on some elements from the original script for Day of the Dead. Filming took place in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. =Ratings= Land of the Dead is the first film in the series to receive an MPAA rating for its theatrical release. Romero had said for years that he would film two versions; an R rated cut for theatrical release and first DVD, and an unrated cut for the second DVD release. Both DVDs were released in the U.S. on October 18, 2005. Rumors suggested that Romero shot alternate, less explicit, gore scenes for the theatrical release, but this is not entirely accurate. The more extreme instances of gore (e.g. a woman having her navel piercing graphically torn out by a zombie) were obscured by foreground elements filmed on bluescreen, so that these overlaid elements could be easily removed for the unrated DVD. Other ways to obscure blood in order to get an R-rating were achieved by simply trimming the grislier shots by a few seconds, by digitally repainting blood so that it is more black than red, or by digitally painting the blood out altogether. British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario gave both the theatrical version and DVD version a rating of 18A, though it was only given a 13+ rating in Quebec. In the UK, the BBFC gave both the theatrical version and the unrated version a 15 certificate for strong language, violence, horror and gore. Every UK release bar the UMD version were rated 18 overall due to a bonus feature (a highlights reel of the goriest moments called Scenes of Carnage). In Germany, both the theatrical and unrated versions were rated 18 anyway. As such, only the unrated version was widely available in Germany. The film was banned in Ukraine. Release The film received positive reviews upon release. It was released one year and three months after the release of the remake Dawn of the Dead. The film grossed over $40 million and is second behind Dawn of the Dead with the highest-grossing revenue (unadjusted for inflation) in the Living Dead series (not including the remakes), the two lowest being Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Diary of the Dead (2008). The film opened the MTV Saturday Horror block on February 27, 2010. Reception Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four for what he considered its skillful and creative allusions, something that he argued was pervasive among Romero's previous three installments, which contained numerous satirical metaphors to American life. Ebert noted this installment's distinction between the rich and poor, those that live in Fiddler's Green and those that live in the slums. John Lutz, in Zombies of the World, Unite: Class Struggle and Alienation in Land of the Dead, drew comparisons between the fireworks which were set off to distract the zombies in Land of the Dead to the US military 'shock and awe' displays seen in its military actions. Michael Wilmington of Chicago Tribune awarded the film four stars, writing, \\"It's another hard-edged, funny, playfully perverse and violent exercise in movie fear and loathing, with an increasingly dark take on a world spinning out of control. By now, Romero has become a classicist who uses character and dialogue as much as stomach-turning special effects to achieve his shivers.\\"Michael Wilmington. \\"Movie Review: Land of the Dead . Chicago Tribune, June 23, 2005. The New York Sun declared it \\"the American movie of the year\\".The New York Sun, \\"What to See This Week\\", June 24, 2005. Author: N.L. Several filmmakers, including John Landis, Eli Roth, Clive Barker, and Guillermo del Toro, paid tribute to Romero in a Land of the Dead special. Guillermo del Toro said: \\"Finally someone was smart enough to realize that it was about time, and gave George the tools. It should be a cause of celebration amongst all of us that Michelangelo has started another ceiling. It's really a momentous occasion...\\"Land of the Dead ‚Äì George A. Romero Tribute Reel ‚Äì Movie Trailers & Clips ‚Äì SPIKE Overall critical reaction was mostly positive; the film received very favorable reviews from The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter, Premiere, Variety, Slate and the Los Angeles Times. The film earned a 74% \\"Certified Fresh\\" positive rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus says, \\"George A. Romero's latest entry in his much-vaunted Dead series is not as fresh as his genre-inventing original, Night of the Living Dead. But Land of the Dead does deliver on the gore and zombies-feasting-on-flesh action.\\" Video game A prequel, Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green, was released later that year.

As of September 2019, versions of BT are broadcast in Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary; versions used to be broadcast in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Montreal, but have been cancelled and replaced with alternative programming. The version broadcast by the Atlantic Satellite Network (which was owned by Citytv's former parent CHUM Limited, and is now owned by competitor Bell Media) continued to use the brand under licence from Rogers until 2011, when it was re-launched as CTV Morning Live upon the service's rebranding as CTV Two Atlantic. On September 5, 2011, each of the local editions of Breakfast Television across all of the Citytv owned-and-operated stations began starting a half-hour earlier, running from 5:30‚Äì9 a.m. In April 2012, the Winnipeg edition reverted to the 6-9 a.m. runtime. In September 2019, the Montreal version of the program was discontinued, while the Calgary and Vancouver versions were re-launched on September 23, 2019 using a \\"hybrid\\" format incorporating segments of national interest from the Toronto version. On March 23, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Breakfast Television added a national hour, airing on all Citytv stations (outside of Citytv Saskatchewan) live at 9:00 a.m. EDT. Toronto edition Breakfast Television premiered on September 9, 1989 with co-hosts Ann Rohmer and David Onley, with MuchMusic VJ Steve Anthony broadcasting from a different spot around the area each day. Kevin Frankish handled news updates from the CityPulse (later CityNews) newsroom (he also handled the overnight updates broadcast from the assignment desk that flowed directly into BT). From 1995 to 2008, BT was simulcast on then-sister station CKVR in Barrie, with VRLand News inserts replacing the CityPulse/CityNews segments. Co-host Liza Fromer quit her job at BT in July 2006, days after the birth of her child. Kevin Frankish has blogged that her departure from the show was \\"on the absolute best of terms\\". BT has encouraged people to send audition tapes for consideration. During the summer of 2006, a number of CHUM personalities were invited to guest co-host with Kevin Frankish in the search for the next permanent host. The guest hosts included CityNews sports anchor Kathryn Humphreys, health specialist Laura DiBattista, consumer specialist Jee-Yun-Lee, former Citytv weather specialist Nalini Sharma, former reporter Melissa Grelo, etalk correspondent Tracy Melchor, BT's own Jennifer Valentyne, and Star!'s Dina Pugliese. On October 13, 2006, Dina Pugliese became the new co-host of the show. Every August since 2005, BT has organized a \\"Viewer Appreciation Day\\", held in the BT parking lot.Inside BT blog: \\"Second BT Viewer Appreciation Day A Smash Success \\", 11 August 2006. Gates open at 6 a.m., and closed due to capacity crowds early into 7 a.m. Some people began camping out at BT at 5:30 p.m. the day before the 2006 Viewer Appreciation Day. Breakfast Television has also held other events, such as a successful world record attempt and a Christmas party. The BT Viewer Appreciation Day has since been cancelled, with only the Christmas Party remaining. Just as many people within the CityNews team started off on the CHUM phoneline, both Jennifer Valentyne and producer Kevin Forget started by working at \\"the BT Diner\\".CityNews: Inside BT Kevin Frankish has publicly discussed his panic attacks with viewers, on air.Inside BT blog: \\"Panic Attacks\\", 31 July 2006. On April 1, 2016 just as the show finished airing, a post on the BT Toronto's Facebook page was made in regards to Jennifer Valentyne not being a part of the show anymore. With it being April Fool's Day many people thinking this was a joke but that was not the case. Kevin and Dina both addressed this over Twitter confirming that this was in fact true to fans asking. Later that evening, on Jennifer's Facebook page she released a statement confirming that it was in fact true. BT decided to eliminate all Live Eye's across the country to give fans more of what they wanted. Many offered love and support over various social media accounts including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to Jennifer and the rest of the BT crew. In March 2019, BT Toronto hosted a week- long kid's competition called BT Kids Got Talent Week, where children showed their talent on the show. It was hosted by BT's Dina Pugliese and Devo Brown.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSN8XapovEs In April 2020, during an interview on Breakfast Television, Simon Cowell announced a spin-off version of the show called Canadian Family's Got Talent carried out virtually by Citytv during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. The contest, presented by Canadian Tire, ran from April 27 to May 26, and was judged by Cowell alongside hosts Dina Pugliese and Devo Brown. The contest was won by Toronto-based singing trio CZN. In July 2020, Roger Petersen announced that he would be leaving BT in a Twitter post. =Notable on-air presenters= Current Anchors/hosts * Dina Pugliese - co-host * Devo Brown - co-host * Frank Ferragine - weather specialist; also fill-in host and Live Eye on-location reporter * Melanie Ng - news anchor and reporter *Stephanie Henry - Traffic Reporter * Nicole Servinis - Live Eye reporter Former *Jennifer Valentyne - Live Eye reporter from 1992 to April. 1, 2016 (now host of The Bachelor & Bachelorette Canada After Show on W Network and a co-host on Derringer in the Morning on Q107) *Steve Anthony - Live Eye reporter 1989 to 1994 (co-host of CP24 Breakfast until 2018 and now head of media relations at Direct Global and Direct Coops) *Hugh Burrill - sports/early morning talk (later as sports reporter for CityNews and now with FAN 590) *Liza Fromer - co-host from 2001 to 2006 (left following end of maternity leave and later host of The Morning Show on Global Toronto until late summer 2016; now MC and author) *Russ Holden - traffic reporter for CHFI since 1967, late with 680News, Citynews and BT (retired September 2017) *Tracy Moore - reporter/fill-in news anchor from 2005 to 2007 (host of CityLine since 2008) *David Onley - news anchor from 1989 to 1994 (later became Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and now retired from broadcasting) *Ann Rohmer - host from 1989 to 2001 (moved on to CP24 after sale to Bell, briefly retired 2015 and now anchor with CP24) *Kevin Frankish - co-host from 1989 to 2018 *Roger Petersen - co- host from 2018 to 2020. Former need anchor on CityNews and briefly as reporter with CFTO Vancouver edition CKVU launched Breakfast Television in 2002. The original hosts of Breakfast Television were Michael Eckford and Fiona Forbes, then they were replaced by Shane Foxman and Beverley Mahood, and since 2005, Simi Sara and Dave Gerry hosted the program, but as of August 13, 2008, they were let go. On January 19, 2010, the length of BT was shortened from four hours to three hours, and six employees laid off as a result of \\"severe financial issues\\" with the Citytv stations. A new format for Breakfast Television debuted in September 2008, with a new traffic and TransLink reporter. As part of Rogers Media's May 3, 2012 renewal of its affiliation agreement with Jim Pattison Group-owned Citytv affiliates CKPG-TV/Prince George, CFJC-TV/Kamloops and CHAT-TV/Medicine Hat, the three stations will begin simulcasting the Vancouver edition of Breakfast Television on September 1, 2012 as part of an expansion of Citytv programming on the stations, which will follow the program grid of CKVU (with breakaways from the Vancouver program grid for their weekday evening and midday newscasts and other locally produced programs).Citytv and Pattison Group Sign Affiliate Agreement , Broadcaster Magazine, May 3, 2012. On September 5, 2019, Rogers laid off 4 employees from CKVU and placed Breakfast Television on hiatus until September 23. At this time the program was relaunched with a new hybrid format, consisting of a mixture of local content with national entertainment and lifestyle segments produced from Toronto. =Notable on-air presenters= Current * Riaz Meghji - Host * Tara Jean Stevens - Host (Trending, Live Eye, Weather) * Kyle Donaldson - News Anchor * Mary Cranston - News Anchor * Greg Harper - Reporter/News Anchor * Thor Diakow - Entertainment Host/ Traffic * Russ Lacate - Weather (also on News1130) Former * Tasha Chiu (2008‚Äì2008) * Michael Eckford - host (2002‚Äì2003), was at CKNW 980 * Fiona Forbes - host (2002‚Äì2003), was at Shaw TV Vancouver * Beverley Mahood - host (2003‚Äì2005); was co-host of CMT Canada's flagship program, CMT Central) * Simi Sara (2005‚Äì2008), now at Global News Radio 980 CKNW * Jody Vance (2012‚Äì2016) - co-host/news anchor, now at Roundhouse Radio * Dawn Chubai (2004-2017) - host (Trending, Live Eye, Weather) Calgary edition CHUM Limited purchased Craig Media in late 2004. The $265 million deal included, among other things, Craig's three A-Channel stations (CKAL-TV in Calgary, Alberta; CKEM-TV in Edmonton, Alberta and CHMI-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In February 2005, CHUM announced that the A-Channel stations would be relaunched as Citytv stations by that fall. The morning show on the original A-Channel stations, The Big Breakfast, was relaunched as Breakfast Television on August 2, 2005 alongside their re-branding as Citytv. The A-Channel brand was subsequently transferred to CHUM's NewNet stations, whose own morning programs were retitled A-Channel Morning. As in Vancouver, Rogers made cuts to Breakfast Television in Calgary in September 2019, placing the program on hiatus and re-launching it on September 23 with the same, aforementioned format changes. =Calgary presenters= Current presenters * Jill Belland - host Past presenters * Ross Hull - Live Eye reporter * Dave Kelly - main anchor (2005‚Äì2009) * Mike McCourt - news anchor Former editions =Winnipeg= CHMI-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba produced a version of Breakfast Television from August 2, 2005 to January 6, 2015 - the station was purchased along with CKAL-DT in Calgary and CKEM-DT in Edmonton. The final hosts were Courtney Ketchen, Jeremy John, Jenna Khan and Drew Kozub. It was replaced with a simulcast of Wheeler in the Morning‚Äîthe morning show of sister radio station CITI-FM‚Äîstarting on January 12, 2015.

Notable former presenters * Pay Chen - host (2009-2011) * Jon Ljungberg - host (?-2010) * Erin Selby - host (2005-2007) =Atlantic Canada= From 1992 to 2011, the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) in Atlantic Canada, now known as CTV Two Atlantic, aired its own local version of BT. At the time of its launch, ASN and Citytv (Toronto) were both owned by CHUM Limited, and both channels had a similar overall movies-focused format. The Atlantic edition of BT was similar to the Toronto version, but with a greater emphasis on the culture of the region, as matters such as commuter traffic are typically less of a concern in Atlantic Canada. ASN was acquired by Baton Broadcasting (predecessor of the present-day Bell Media) in 1997, but was permitted to continue using Breakfast Television as the title of its morning show. In August 2011, the program was re-branded as CTV Morning Live, in keeping with the launch (or relaunch) of local morning shows under the same title on CTV and CTV Two stations in various parts of Canada. = Edmonton = On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced the cancellation of Breakfast Television in Edmonton as part of cutbacks. It was replaced by a spin-off known as Dinner Television, which was a two-hour weeknight newsmagazine which did not contain original news reporting. Encores of the previous edition of Dinner Television with an \\"L-bar\\" displaying updated news and weather information were broadcast during its former morning timeslot. Dinner Television was subsequently cancelled and replaced by the newly- relaunched CityNews in 2017. The morning timeslot is now filled by CityLine. Notable former presenters * Bill Welychka - host (2005-2006) = Montreal = Rogers was granted approval by the CRTC on December 20, 2012 to acquire CJNT Montreal and convert it from a multicultural station to a fully English Citytv station.

The delivery of advertising mail forms a large and growing service for many postal services, and direct-mail marketing forms a significant portion of the direct marketing industry. Some organizations attempt to help people opt out of receiving advertising mail, in many cases motivated by a concern over its negative environmental impact. Advertising mail includes advertising circulars, plastic mailers, coupon envelopes (Money Mailer, Valpak), catalogs, CDs, ‚Äúpre- approved‚Äù credit card applications, and other commercial merchandising materials delivered to homes and businesses. It may be addressed to pre- selected individuals, or unaddressed and delivered on a neighbourhood-by- neighbourhood basis.  Postal services  1928 direct mail advertising letter offering mail delivery of fish and seafood Postal systems offer lower rates for buyers of bulk mail permits. In order to qualify for these rates, marketers must format and sort the mail in specific ways ‚Äì which reduces the handling required by the postal service. Income from advertising mail represents a significant and growing portion of some postal services' budgets, and it is a service actively marketed by them.See e.g. In the United States, ad mail dollars decreased from $96.6 billion in 2004, to $80.9 billion in 2013. A study by Boston Consulting Group predicts that overall share of ad- spend in the USA will increase from 11% in to 12% by 2020. In Canada, addressed and unaddressed advertising mail accounted for 20% of Canada Post's revenue in 2005, and the share is increasing. Postal services employ the terms advertising mail, admail, and direct mail, while avoiding and objecting to the pejorative term junk mail. The United States Postal Service offers a direct mail service known as Every Door Direct Mail,What is EDDM?, USPS that provides resources allowing businesses to target, design, print and mail to specific households without needing to know the addresses. In many developed countries, advertising mail represents a significant and growing amount of the total volume of mail. In the United States, \\"Standard mail: advertising\\" comprised 29% of all mail in 1980 and 43% in 2003.  Direct mail marketing  Direct mail is a common form of direct marketing, and may be employed by for-profit businesses, charities and other non-profits, political campaigns, and other organizations. Direct mail encompasses a wide variety of marketing materials, including brochures, catalogs, postcards, newsletters and sales letters. In 2015 more than 150 million direct mail promotions were sent out with a reported 42% of respondents scanning or reading the mail. = Creation = Copywriters write the words, also known as copy, for direct mail. These copywriters are known inside the trade as direct response copywriters. Direct response copy follows a proven format based on testing results. Graphic designers who specialize in direct marketing also play a key role in the success of direct mail programs. Many direct mail marketers will mail different version of copy (A/B testing) to test the effectiveness of different appeals. The winning mail package will be known as the control and the direct mail company will continue to mail the control until a different package produces improved results, usually measured by metrics such as revenue and conversion rate. = Targeting = Advertisers often refine direct mail practices into targeted mailing, in which mail is sent following database analysis to select recipients considered most likely to respond positively. This reduces costs for mailers by narrowing the mailing universe to only the most likely audience. For example, a person who has demonstrated an interest in golf may receive direct mail for golf-related products, or perhaps for goods and services that are appropriate for golfers. This use of database analysis is a type of database marketing. Alternatively, unaddressed direct mail may be sent on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis. Whether at the individual or neighbourhood level, direct mail marketing allows recipients to be targeted, attempting to match the demographic profile of the recipients to one most closely matching that of likely customers. Individually targeted direct mail may be tailored based on previous transactions and gathered data. For example, all male recipients of an offer may receive a personalized package with a man's picture on the cover, while all female recipients receive a picture of a woman. Often advertisers will include a Johnson Box in letters. These are aimed at drawing the targeted consumers into reading further in the letter.http://www.brucemayhewconsulting.com/index.cfm?PAGEPATH=Best_Practices/Johnson_Box&ID;=2055 = Cost-effectiveness = To the non-professional direct mail may seem wasteful, yet the medium can be one of the most cost-effective. Database targeting combined with an effective pricing, creative and list strategy can reduce waste and maximize profitable results for the mailer. Testing is accomplished in a variety of ways including A/B split testing of new mailings versus a control, testing lists through \\"Nth\\" name selects. = Political usage = Political campaigns make frequent use of direct mail, both to gain votes from the electorate as a whole, and to target certain groups of voters thought to be open to a candidate's message and to appeal for campaign funds. Certain organizations and individuals have become known for their prowess in direct mail, including in the US, the Free Congress Foundation in the 1970s, Response Dynamics, Inc. in the 1980s, the National Congressional Club, and Richard Viguerie. With the advent of the Internet in political campaigns, direct mail became just one of many campaign management tools, but still played a significant role. = Nonprofit = Nonprofit companies use direct mail marketing as a consistent form of advertising. In its modern form, direct mail fundraising appeared in the United States after World War II, when nationwide charities such as the National Easter Seal Society sought ways to broaden their fundraising base. It was only with the advent in the 1960s of the ZIP code and, later, the computer that direct mail fundraising began to gain wide use. Before the ZIP code, it was difficult to target appropriate recipients of direct mail fundraising appeals, and before the computer, compiling and maintaining lists of supporters was tedious and costly. During the 1970s, when computers became increasingly affordable, the use of direct mail fundraising spread widely. It quickly became the means by which most Americans learned about and first provided financial support for their charities of choice. The explosive growth of the nonprofit sector in the United States ‚Äî quadrupling in the 1980s and doubling again in the 1990s and early 2000s ‚Äî led to a massive expansion in the use of direct mail to build and sustain large, nationwide donor and membership lists. Today, direct mail fundraising accounts for at least one-fifth of the more than $250 billion contributed annually in the U.S. to the nation's 1.6 million nonprofit organizations Direct mail fundraising has its own unique jargon, much of it related to the art and science of creating, producing and mailing the right appeal to the right list at the right time, and measuring the results.Sharpe, Alan. Ed. Direct Mail Fundraising Glossary. In recent years, electronic communication media has been used more commonly among nonprofits. Online, email, and social media campaigns, collectively referred to as digital fundraising, have been used in coordination with direct mail fundraising. Nonprofits supplement direct mail campaigns with email blasts and social media posts, using similar messaging and visuals to tie the various communications together. However, digital fundraising has not grown fast enough to replace direct mail for most nonprofits. In 2012, digital fundraising accounted for 7 percent of charitable donations in the United States.https://www.blackbaud.com/files/resources/downloads/2012.CharitableGivingReport.pdf This form of marketing is increasingly used by charitable groups in the UK. In 2013, ¬£239 million was spent by British charities on direct mail advertising campaigns. = Current relevance = Direct mail marketing is under scrutiny by many of its former and current advocates. The arguments against using direct mail marketing include possible impact on the environment and changing attitudes among consumers. In the United States, the common practice of address standardization can defeat the purpose of advertising mail by stripping away local identity, thus leaving many recipients alienated. It is also argued that direct mail is not cost efficient. It has been suggested that social media will eventually replace direct mail as the preferred method for marketing communications. Those who believe direct mail marketing has a future cite its strong growth in 2011. It has been reported that large publishers like the Tribune Company and RR Donnelley have growing direct mail divisions. Nonprofit organizations continue to use direct mail at a subsidized USPS rate. = Business-to-business mailings (B2B) = When targeted to other businesses rather than individuals, direct mail is known as a business-to-business mailing. Traditionally, this worked in one of two ways: as a direct sale, therefore precluding the use of a salesperson or a retail store, or as a method of generating leads for a salesforce. The former method was ideally used by products that were easy to sell, were familiar to the prospect and needed no demonstration. The latter method was used for large-ticket items or for those that needed demonstration, for example. One method of direct mailing used in B2B is known as \\"bill-me\\". In this direct-mail marketing offer, the buyer is shipped the product prior to payment and then is sent an invoice later.  Opting out  Several organizations offer opt-out services to people who wish to reduce or eliminate the amount of addressed advertising mail they receive. In the UK, the Mailing Preference Service allows people to register with them for removal from posted as opposed to hand-delivered mail. As of 2017 in the United States two organizations offering these services include Catalog Choice and DMAChoice. A similar organization by the name of 41pounds.org received customer complaints and then became defunct. Another one by the name of Tonic Mailstopper (formerly GreenDimes) no longer appears to be in business either. Several websites critical of junk mail have guides for people interested in reducing the amount of junk mail they get, such as the Center for a New American Dream.See e.g. , In response to a US Supreme Court ruling (Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U.S. 728 (1970)), the United States Postal Service enables an applicant to obtain a Prohibitory Order, which gives people the power to stop non-governmental organizations from sending them mail, and to demand such organizations remove the consumers‚Äô information from their mailing lists. A \\"No Junkmail\\" sticker on a mailbox in Calgary, Canada In Canada, the highly publicized Red Dot Campaign offers advice on reducing unaddressed advertising mail. The campaign focuses on advertising the Canada Post policy to respect \\"No Junkmail\\" signs, noting that this policy is not promoted by Canada Post itself. The name \\"red dot\\" refers to an internal marker used by Canada Post to indicate which households do not wish to receive unaddressed admail. The UK Royal Mail also offers an opt-out service, though it sparked public outrage by warning that unaddressed government mailings could not be separated from advertisements, and those who opted out of the latter would stop receiving the former as well.  Criticism  = Environmental effect = Several of the above organizations, as well as environmental groups, express concern about the environmental impact generated by direct mail. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 44% of junk mail is discarded without being opened or read, equalling four million tons of waste paper per year, with 32% recovered for recycling. Further, the Ohio Office of Compliance Assistance and Pollution Prevention (OCAPP) estimates that 250,000 homes could be heated for a single day's junk mail (70,000,000,000,000/3 btus of energy or 28,870,000,000/21 kWh of energy). In the UK, the Minister of State responsible for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimated that \\"direct mail and promotions\\" accounted for between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes of paper in 2002, with 13% being recycled. The government and the Direct Marketing Association (UK) together agreed on recycling targets for the direct mail industry, including a goal of 55% by 2009, though the DMA's latest estimates are that the industry will fall well short of this mark. Mike Berners-Lee estimates that receiving five letters per day plus two printed catalogs per week results in CO2e per year. A New York Times article from 2009 states that in the United States 51.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases are emitted each year from mail advertisements. The Environmental Protection Agency indicates that in 2009 total US greenhouse gas emissions were 6,700.10 million metric tons. =Privacy issues= Recipients may conceive of advertising mail as a privacy problem, both because its generation requires extensive collection and use of information, and because receipt of mail can be an intrusion into the home. Numerous public opinion polls have found that Americans find advertising mail intrusive,See e.g. for instance, in June 2003, the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that 19 percent of Americans found, \\"junk mail delivered by the postal service\\" a very big intrusion and 33 percent found it to be a big intrusion. Researchers at the University of California recently found that four out of five Americans favor a do-not-mail law, similar to the existing do-not-call telemarketing registry.

In 1963, Fletcher walked the length of that portion of Grand Canyon contained within the 1963 boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. Although his route spans only a little more than one-third the length of Grand Canyon, Fletcher was only the second person to complete this section and the first to accomplish the feat \\"in one go\\" ‚Äî as chronicled in his bestselling 1968 memoir The Man Who Walked Through Time. Fletcher obtained the route information critical for successfully completing his epic trip from the godfather of Grand Canyon hiking, Harvey Butchart, who completed the distance barely ahead of Fletcher the same year ‚Äî having hiked it one section at a time over 17 years. Through his influential hiker's guide, The Complete Walker, published the same year, he became a kind of \\"spiritual godfather\\" of the wilderness backpacking movement. Through successive editions, this book became the definitive work on the topic and was christened \\"the Hiker's Bible\\" by Field & Stream magazine. Biography =Early life and career= Born in Cardiff, Wales, on 14 March 1922, Fletcher was educated in England and served six years in the Royal Marine Commandos during World War II. He married Sonia Mary Ash in 1945 and they lived in St. Ives, Cornwall for a year where he was an instructor at the Mountain Warfare Training Centre. They moved to Kenya in 1947 where they ran the Kitale Hotel. They separated in 1948 and he spent time farming in Kenya, surveying in Zimbabwe, and as a prospector in western Canada. He moved to the United States in 1956. Two years later, he walked the length of the state of California, a journey that was the basis for his first book, The Thousand-Mile Summer. =Writing career= Fletcher published a total of 10 books between 1964 and 2001, which included four editions of The Complete Walker. His first book, The Thousand-Mile Summer (1964) recounted his 1958 hike along the entire eastern edge of California. His second book was The Man Who Walked Through Time (1968), in which Fletcher was the first person to walk a continuous route through Grand Canyon National Park. The book covered such topics as technique, the journey itself, and reflections which included the concept, after weeks of walking, of achieving a state of mentally \\"merging\\" with the place that one is visiting. When Fletcher conducted the trip in 1963, the National Park did not encompass the entire length of the canyon, the park was later expanded to include the entire Canyon. The first person to walk the entire length of the Grand Canyon was Kenton Grua in 1977. He was inspired by Fletcher's book but set out to \\"do it right\\" by walking from end to end, not just the section of the canyon inside the National Park. In 1968, Fletcher published the first edition of The Complete Walker, his most popular work, including three new editions, with the last in 2001, in total selling over 500,000 copies.\\"Colin Fletcher, 85, a Trailblazer of Modern Backpacking, Dies\\", The New York Times, 19 June 2007 Fletcher's book is distinguished by its encyclopedic treatment of the technique and equipment of wilderness travel, as well as by what critics and readers have praised as its rousing humor and elegant, vigorous prose. While certainly comprehensive in its discussion of all aspects of wilderness travel, it also devotes a generous amount of coverage to Fletcher's self- confessed idiosyncrasies, ranging from his affection for walking staffs and corduroy shorts to his loathing of wilderness trail guidebooks. In the early 1970s, Fletcher returned to Kenya's Serengeti Plain, and Great Rift Valley for a year, an experience he recounted in The Winds of Mara, published in 1973. In 1981, he published The Man From the Cave, which relates how, after finding a trunk and a few belongings abandoned by someone in a desert cave in Nevada, he spent years piecing together the life story of \\"Trunkman.\\" As he pieced together the mystery of the man's life, Fletcher saw in it a discovery and reflection of himself, \\"We both valued solitude and silence and square, smoothed-off granite boulders.\\" In 1989, Fletcher rafted and hiked the entire length of the Green/Colorado River from its source in the Wind River Range of Wyoming to the Gulf of California. He related the story of the journey in River (1997), using his customary description of the places through which he travelled as a metaphor, comparing the course of the river and its emptying into the sea, to life itself, and his own life in particular. His last edition of The Complete Walker, The Complete Walker IV (2002), was written with Chip Rawlins. =Later years= In his later years, Fletcher became a prolific writer on environmental issues. He was publicity-shy, rarely responding to letters or interview requests, although always willing to incorporate reader feedback into revised editions of The Complete Walker. In 2001, at the age of seventy-nine, Fletcher was struck and seriously injured by an SUV while walking to a town meeting near his home in Monterey County, California. His survival was attributed to his excellent physical condition. Within a year of the accident, he was back on his feet and walking daily. According to published obituaries, Fletcher died on 12 June 2007 in Monterey, California, as a result of complications from a head injury sustained from being hit by the car six years earlier. Influence and legacy Annette McGivney, editor of Backpacker, has written that \\"Colin was sort of the founding father of modern backpacking, the first person to write about going out for an extended period and being self-sufficient.\\" Because many people started following Fletcher's advice in The Complete Walker, according to McGivney, \\"the book could be credited with starting the backpacking industry,\\" including equipment makers and periodicals like Backpacker. Through his writings Fletcher \\"inspired a generation of young Americans to take up backpacking as means of filling a spiritual void,\\"\\"Colin Fletcher, March 1922-June 2007\\" , Backpacker, 14 June 2007 and to escape from the confusion of Vietnam-era America: > \\"After Vietnam, I was trying to figure out what to do with my life. So many > of my friends had died from bullet holes,\\" recalls Backpacker contributing > editor Buck Tilton. \\"I read The Man Who Walked Through Time, and it was the > only thing that made sense to me. Fletcher's words gave meaning to > backpacking. I loaded my pack exactly the way Fletcher did and carried a > walking stick like his. He was my hero.\\"  Quotes  *God is light, we are told, and Hell is outer darkness. But look at a desert mountain stripped bare by the sun, and you learn only geography. Watch darkness claim it, and for a moment you may grasp why God had to create Satan ‚Äî or man to create both. ‚Äî The Thousand-Mile Summer (1964) *Dedicated urbanites \\"know\\" beyond shadow of doubt ‚Äî because doubt never raises its disturbing head ‚Äî that civilization is the real world: you only \\"escape\\" to wilderness. When you're out and away and immersed, you \\"know\\" the obverse: the wilderness world is real, the human world a superimposed facade ... The controversy is, of course, spurious. Neither view can stand alone. Both worlds are real. But the wilderness world is certainly older and will almost certainly last longer. Besides, the second view seems far healthier for a human to embrace. ‚Äî River (1997) *But if you judge safety to be the paramount consideration in life you should never, under any circumstances, go on long hikes alone. Don't take short hikes alone, either ‚Äî or, for that matter, go anywhere alone. And avoid at all costs such foolhardy activities as driving, falling in love, or inhaling air that is almost certainly riddled with deadly germs. Wear wool next to the skin. Insure every good and chattel you possess against every conceivable contingency the future might bring, even if the premiums half-cripple the present. Never cross an intersection against a red light, even when you can see all roads are clear for miles. And never, of course, explore the guts of an idea that seems as if it might threaten one of your more cherished beliefs. In your wisdom you will probably live to be a ripe old age. But you may discover, just before you die, that you have been dead for a long, long time. ‚Äî The Complete Walker  Bibliography  *The Thousand-Mile Summer (1964) and *The Man Who Walked Through Time (1968) and *The Complete Walker (1968) **The New Complete Walker (1974) **The Complete Walker III (1984) and **The Complete Walker IV (2002) *The Winds of Mara (1973) *The Man from the Cave (1981) and *The Secret Worlds of Colin Fletcher (1989) and *River: One Man's Journey Down the Colorado, Source to Sea (1997) *Autobiography (incomplete and unpublished - started in 2001 just before the accident) References External links *Colin Fletcher memorabilia, photos & tours, California Serendipity. *Obituary, The New York Times. *Obituary, Sierra Club *Obituary, NPR. *Obituary, Metafilter. *California Serendipity, The Thousand-Mile Summer Revisited Retracing Colin Fletcher's voyage 1958-2008.

As an organization with expertise in law, technology, and policy, CDT works to preserve the unique nature of the Internet, enhance freedom of expression globally, protect fundamental rights of privacy, and stronger legal controls on government surveillance by finding practical and innovative solutions to public policy challenges while protecting civil liberties. CDT is dedicated to building consensus among all parties interested in the future of the Internet and other new communications media. In addition to its office in Washington, D.C., CDT has a full-time presence in Brussels. Today, CDT has expanded its scope to include tech policy issues across disciplines and borders, continuing to work to protect privacy, promote security, and draw attention to all the ways in which technology changes the landscape of democracy. CDT relies on an expertise-based advocacy model and acts as a non-partisan body, drawing together perspectives and voices from varying backgrounds to emphasize the importance of technology's role in the freedom, expression, security, privacy, and integrity of the individual. CDT advises government officials, agencies, corporations, and civil society on technology and technology-related policy.  History  =Founding = CDT was founded in 1994 by Jerry Berman, the former executive director and former policy director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Specifically, passage of Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which expanded law enforcement wiretapping capabilities by requiring telephone companies to design their networks to ensure a certain basic level of government access, spurred Berman to found CDT. Recognizing a threat to privacy and innovation in CALEA's design mandates, CDT fought the passage of the CALEA and later worked to ensure that its implementation would not extend to the Internet. In the end, CALEA did not contain wiretapping design mandates for the Internet and required transparency surrounding design standards. CDT's launch was assisted by seed donations from AT&T; Corporation, Bell Atlantic, Nynex, Apple, and Microsoft. = 1994‚Äì1999 = In its early years, CDT fought the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in its attempt to restrict free expression online for the sake of child safety. CDT founded the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC), a coalition of free speech groups and tech companies for the advancement of free speech. Against the proposed government censorship of the CDA, the CIEC maintained that both child safety and free speech could be protected by giving users the right to control their own content access. To provide further context for the case, CDT wired the courtroom so that the judges of Philadelphia's District Court could see the Internet. After combining forces with the ACLU, the CIEC's counsel argued the case before the Supreme Court. The CDA was struck down unanimously in 1997. In the following year, CDT helped to craft the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Testifying before Congress, CDT argued that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should be able to develop rules to protect both adults' and children's privacy online. Forming a coalition of free expression and youth rights groups, CDT and its coalition secured an amendment to limit parental consent to children 12 and under, allowing teenagers to enjoy more freedom online. In a 1999 report, CDT made clear that the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) attempts to regulate online political speech according to campaign finance laws were impractical and to the detriment of civic political engagement. CDT worked against the FEC's proposal with an organized group of online activists and bloggers. In collaboration with the Institute for Politics, Democracy, and the Internet, CDT created guidelines to help the FEC and Congress consider their treatment of citizens' political speech online. In support, hundreds of concerned parties signed onto the listing of principles, urging the FEC to drop its proposed rules and Congress to end the rule-making. CDT's grassroots advocacy reversed the tide. The FEC abandoned its proposal and issued a new rule that applied campaign finance regulations only to paid online advertising, protecting the online political speech of citizens. =2000‚Äì2007= CDT launched the Global Internet Policy Initiative in 2000, partnering with Internews to survey 11 developing countries to assess their telecom and Internet policies. CDT staff worked with Frank LaRue to shape a report on Internet human rights and the U.S. Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council to educate members of the Council on Internet freedom in advance of the successful Resolution on Internet Freedom. Following an influx of spyware in 2003, CDT filed complaints against egregious actors with the FTC, resulting in historic settlements against spyware companies. CDT pulled together anti- spyware and anti-virus companies, leading security product distributors, and public interest groups to create the Anti-Spyware Coalition (ASC). The ASC developed a self-regulatory model for companies based on shared definitions of spyware, a comprehensive risk model, best practices for software companies, and a concise vendor conflict resolution process. Using the ASC outputs, anti- spyware companies could label malicious software and protect consumers without fear of being sued by the companies they were targeting, and advertisers could keep better track of where their advertisements were displayed. In 2006, CDT united with the Business for Social Responsibility to assemble human rights advocates, companies, researchers, and investors to deal with government calls for censorship and restriction of information access. The pairing has successfully worked together to create an accountability framework and principles for the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a human rights organization that promotes the privacy of individual users while preventing online censorship by authoritarian governments. In 2007, CDT was among the first advocacy organizations to formally call for a Do Not Track (DNT) list from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In addition, CDT has played an integral role in pushing for a standardized DNT header at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In 2010, the FTC requested a system that would allow consumers to control whether they were tracked online. In response, all five major browsers put DNT features into place, granting users the ability to surf the web incognito. The W3C formed a Tracking Protection Working Group in order to standardize the DNT compliance, which CDT leadership had a prominent role in. =2008‚Äì2012= CDT has also voiced privacy concerns about \\"deep packet inspection\\" (DPI), a technology that allows companies to collect data from Internet service providers (ISPs) and categorize individual Internet traffic streams to service ads based on that information without user consent. CDT conducted legal analysis to show how DPI advertising practices could violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and testified before Congress. In 2009, major ISPs affirmed that they would not use DPI-based behavioral advertising without robust opt-in provisions. In the same year, CDT started the Health Privacy Project to bring expertise to complex privacy issues surrounding technology use in health care. A year later, CDT recommended new guidelines for reporting data breaches and for protecting health data used in marketing. These guidelines were incorporated into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Later in 2010, CDT launched the Digital Due Process Coalition, establishing four principles for Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) reform. Currently, the coalition has over one hundred members including some of the biggest Internet companies to advocacy groups across the entire political spectrum. The campaign for ECPA reform has brought the need for extending full constitutional protections to the Internet to the forefront of the national debate and has resulted in 2013 coalition-supported bipartisan bills in both houses of Congress.[7] Two copyright enforcement bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA), were introduced to the US Congress in 2010 and 2011. Both bills posed serious threats to the technical grounds of the Internet, as well as freedom of expression online, by increasing the role of ISPs and Internet intermediaries in combating online copyright infringement. In opposition to SOPA and PIPA, the CDT gathered organizations from technical and civil society backgrounds. The efforts of CDT provided critical legal analysis which laid the foundation for 2012's surge of grassroots resistance against SOPA and PIPA. CDT was one of the few civil society organizations involved in the founding of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), encouraging a bottom-up style of governance and making certain that the voice of the Internet users be included at the table. In the ICANN deliberations, CDT argued for public representation and for the placement of a Civil Society representative on its Board. In helping to form the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Principles for Internet Policy Making in 2011, CDT also pushed for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance. OECD's 34 member states committed to respect human rights, open governance, rule of law, and consideration of numerous viewpoints by accepting the principles. = 2012‚Äìpresent = At the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in 2012, CDT brought inclusive Internet governance into focus. Though many governments came bearing proposals to escalate government and ITU control over Internet governance, CDT defeated all such proposals through organized civil society advocacy. In addition, CDT fortified relationships between organizations for the sake of future advocacy efforts. Even now, inclusive Internet governance faces serious obstacles as nations scramble to respond to news of the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance. CDT continues to work with an expanding group of partners motivated by civil society concern to preserve the free and open nature of the Internet. CDT requested Congress make Congressional Research Services Reports (CRS) publicly available and easily accessible. When Congress failed to do so, CDT started a website, OpenCRS.com, that made CRS reports freely available online. OpenCRS.com was one of the leading sources of CRS reports. By collecting CRS reports acquired by organizations and citizens through direct appeals to their representatives, the OpenCRS website served as a valuable repository of information. Though no longer in operation, the OpenCRS inspired other CRS websites and open resources. CDT has long been an active supporter of Internet neutrality. In a brief filed in 2012, CDT supported the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet Rules. The rules detailed the limited role of the agency by blocking discrimination by broadband providers. In this way, the FCC intended to protect online free expression and innovation. In 2014, the Open Internet Rules were struck down, drawing CDT back into the fight for Internet neutrality on a global scale. By offering up extensive expertise, CDT has ensured that any EU regulation on Internet neutrality takes into account the central tenet of nondiscrimination. In the early 1990s, the NSA developed and promoted the \\"clipper chip\\", an encryption device for telephone calls. The NSA argued that government access to cryptographic keys was essential to national security ‚Äì CDT and its allies claimed that the clipper chip would introduce greater vulnerabilities into the country's communications networks. In 2013, on behalf of a coalition of Internet companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter and advocates for free speech and privacy rights such as ACLU, EFF, and Mozilla, CDT delivered a \\"We Need To Know\\" letter to U.S. government officials, demanding greater transparency in matters of national security-related surveillance of Internet and telephone communications.[10] Advocating for reform, CDT's firm stance is that the NSA's surveillance programs and its interference with Internet security infringe on privacy, are chilling free speech and association, and threaten the free flow of information that is the foundation of the open Internet. As an advocacy organization, CDT has outlined key reforms to NSA surveillance. Project teams =Privacy and data= CDT's Privacy and Data Project examines the evolving role of technology in daily life, considering its influence on individuals, communities, and law. In identifying emerging issues and collaborating with companies and public officials, CDT's privacy experts are able to develop forward-thinking technical and policy solutions. Among the topics covered by CDT's Privacy and Data team are Health Privacy, the Internet of Things, Broadband Privacy, Drones, Student Privacy, and Digital Decisions. Additionally, CDT heads the State Privacy Resource Center, which serves as a repository of information to help policymakers at the state and local level craft privacy legislation. =Free expression= Today's tech affords individuals the ability to communicate, receive, publish, and interpret information and ideas like never before. Understanding that the free flow of information is essential to any healthy democratic process, CDT's Free Expression Project works both to ensure that free speech protections extend to online expression and to block censorship and content gatekeeping. As new platforms for discourse emerge and revolutionize the application of the First Amendment, maintaining the integrity of a user-defined online experience is of utmost importance. Currently, CDT's Free Expression team focuses on issues of Digital Copyright, Intermediary Liability, Children's Privacy, and Net Neutrality. =Security and surveillance= The technological advancements of today allow governments the means to access troves of personal information by collecting and analyzing the data generated and stored on the devices of individuals. Reasonable, and effectively enforced, checks need to be placed on governments' access to and use of individuals' data to preserve the rights to privacy and free expression. Security must exist in accordance with individual freedoms; it is clear that balanced policies and laws are the only way to achieve both aims. The Security and Surveillance Project of CDT fights to put those balanced checks in place, presently considering issues of ECPA reform, cybersecurity, U.S. government surveillance, drones, and encryption and government hacking. =Internet architecture= If human rights are to thrive in modernity, the values of individual security, privacy, and free expression must be considered with regard to the increasingly digital world. Principles must be ingrained in the foundation of technology, guiding future development and imagined uses. CDT's Internet Architecture team uses their technical expertise to influence legislation, understanding the importance of informed policy-making. Today, CDT's Internet Architecture team focuses on online anonymity and encryption, the standards that govern the technical decisions of internet operation, net neutrality, government surveillance, internet governance policies at across the globe, cybersecurity research, and election security and privacy. =European Union= When it comes to influencing technology policy on a global scale, the perspective and performance of the EU factors in significantly. With a full-time presence in Brussels, CDT is able to promote the fundamental principles of an open and inclusive Internet in collaboration with the EU's Member States, civil society, public institutions, and technology sector. CDT's EU Office focuses on the policy areas of digital copyright, intermediary liability and free expression, surveillance and government access to personal data, net neutrality, internet governance, and data protection and privacy. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), EU net neutrality policy, European Commission's cybersecurity strategy, and the EU intellectual property enforcement directive are among the issues that CDT's Brussels Office has actively engaged with. Funding One-third of CDT's funding comes from foundations and associated grants such as the MacArthur Foundation, while another third of the organization's annual budget comes from various industry sources. The remainder is split among an annual fundraising dinner known in DC circles as the \\"tech prom\\", Cy Pres awards, and other sources.

Zaum () are the linguistic experiments in sound symbolism and language creation of Russian Futurist poets such as Velimir Khlebnikov and Aleksei Kruchenykh. Coined by Kruchenykh in 1913, the word zaum is made up of the Russian prefix –∑–∞ \\"beyond, behind\\" and noun —É–º \\"the mind, nous\\" and has been translated as \\"transreason\\", \\"transration\\" or \\"beyonsense\\" (Paul Schmidt). According to scholar Gerald Janecek, zaum can be defined as experimental poetic language characterized by indeterminacy in meaning. Kruchenykh, in \\"Declaration of the Word as Such (1913)\\", declares zaum \\"a language which does not have any definite meaning, a transrational language\\" that \\"allows for fuller expression\\" whereas, he maintains, the common language of everyday speech \\"binds\\". He further maintained, in \\"Declaration of Transrational Language (1921)\\", that zaum \\"can provide a universal poetic language, born organically, and not artificially, like Esperanto.\\" Examples of zaum include Kruchenykh's poem \\"Dyr bul shchyl\\", Kruchenykh's libretto for the Futurist opera Victory over the Sun with music by Mikhail Matyushin and stage design by Kazimir Malevich, and Khlebnikov's so-called \\"language of the birds\\", \\"language of the gods\\" and \\"language of the stars\\". The poetic output is perhaps comparable to that of the contemporary Dadaism but the linguistic theory or metaphysics behind zaum was entirely devoid of the gentle self-irony of that movement and in all seriousness intended to recover the sound symbolism of a lost aboriginal tongue. Exhibiting traits of a Slavic national mysticism, Kruchenykh aimed at recovering the primeval Slavic mother-tongue in particular. In modern times, since 1962 Serge Segay was creating zaum poetry.–ö—É–∑—å–º–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ö., –ö–æ–≤–∞–ª—ë–≤ –ì. –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –Ω–æ–≤–µ–π—à–µ–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–æ—ç–∑–∏–∏ —É –ì–æ–ª—É–±–æ–π –õ–∞–≥—É–Ω—ã. ‚Äî –¢. 5–ë. Rea Nikonova started creating zaum verses probably a bit later, around 1964. Their zaum poetry can be seen e.g. in issues of famous \\"Transponans\\" samizdat magazine.Transponans, made available online by Toronto University In 1990, contemporary avant-garde poet Sergei Biriukov has founded an association of poets called the \\"Academy of Zaum\\" in Tambov. The use of Zaum peaked from 1916 to 1920 during World War I. At this time, Zaumism took root as a movement primarily involved in visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestoes, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Zaum activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publications. The movement influenced later styles, Avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including surrealism, nouveau r√©alisme, Pop Art and Fluxus.

June 24, 2010) was a Manitoba politician. He served as a Cabinet Minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin, Walter Weir, Sterling Lyon and Gary Filmon, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1971. A long- serving member of the Manitoba legislature, he retired from public life in 2003. The son of Reverend John Herman Enns, a minister for the First Mennonite Church, and Agathe Unruh, Enns was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and worked as a rancher before entering politics. He was married to Eleanor Jones. His brother Siegfried John Enns served in the Canadian House of Commons. Legislative career A Progressive Conservative, Enns was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1966, for the rural riding of Rockwood-Iberville. In 1969, redistribution placed Enns in the riding of Lakeside, where he defeated Liberal leader Robert Bend by about 350 votes. The Lakeside riding had previously been held by former Premier of Manitoba Douglas Campbell for forty- seven years. Enns would hold the seat for a further thirty-four years, being re-elected in 1973, 1977, 1981, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1995 and 1999. After 1969, he never had any problems retaining the riding. Career as cabinet minister Enns was appointed Minister of Agriculture by Dufferin Roblin on July 22, 1967. He retained this position when Walter Weir replaced Roblin as Premier later in the year, also becoming the Acting Minister of Highways (Enns had supported Weir in the party's leadership contest). On September 5, 1968, he was moved to the Ministry of Mines and Natural Resources. Enns found himself at the centre of a significant controversy in early 1969, when he announced that the Manitoba government would allow Manitoba Hydro to flood South Indian Lake in the northern part of the province. This announcement was widely criticized, as the plan threatened serious disruption for indigenous communities in the area. Some critics argued that the plan itself was unviable, while others argued that the government did not adequately consult with the affected communities.For coverage of the initial announcement and critical, see Winnipeg Free Press, 21 January 1969, p. 4; Winnipeg Free Press, 22 January 1969, pp. 1, 3. During a legislative debate, Sidney Green was quoted as saying, \\"I submit that the denial of justice to the peoples involved at South Indian Lake will result in an inevitable erosion of the rights of every citizen of Manitoba.\\" See Winnipeg Free Press, 28 January 1969, p. 8. The Manitoba Indian Brotherhood came out in opposition to the scheme, as did the Liberals and New Democrats, and the planned flooding became a significant issue in the 1969 provincial election. In the government of Sterling Lyon, Enns served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Highways from October 24, 1977 to October 20, 1978; Minister of Highways and Transport (a renamed position) from October 20, 1978 to November 15, 1979; Minister of Government Services from April 12, 1979 to January 16, 1981; and Minister of Natural Resources from January 16, 1981 to November 30, 1981. He was not a candidate to succeed Lyon as party leader in 1983, however. Enns was not named to Gary Filmon's first cabinet, but became Minister of Natural Resources on April 21, 1989. He held this position until September 10, 1993, when he became Minister of Agriculture for a second time (after a gap of twenty-five years). He continued to hold this portfolio until the Filmon government was defeated in 1999, and was responsible for managing the AIDA and NISA files during the flood emergency of 1997. Intraparty activity In 1971, Enns declared himself a candidate to replace Weir as leader of the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives. The contest highlighted the ideological divisions of the party: Enns, who represented its rural and conservative wing, lost to urban progressive Sidney Spivak by 46 votes. In 2000, he supported Stockwell Day for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance party.National Post, 10 May 2000 Politics and controversies In 1976, Enns nearly derailed plans by the Schreyer government to bring a series of Russian artworks from Leningrad's Hermitage and the State Russian Museum to Manitoba, during a North American tour. His position was grounded in an opposition to Communism and the Soviet Union, though he eventually withdrew his objections. During the mid-1980s, Enns was a vocal opponent of officially re-entrenching French-language services in Manitoba (a policy being pursued by the New Democratic government of Howard Pawley). Ironically, his seat was targeted by the anti-bilingualism Confederation of Regions Party in 1986, although this challenge ultimately came to very little. A philosophical conservative, Enns was also responsible for weakening market board control over Manitoba's hog farms, and appears to have had similar intentions regarding its fishing industry. In 1995-96, he was accused of approving illegal fishing activities by the Spirit River Fish Company, though he denied this charge. Perhaps his greatest contribution to Canada, was the role he played in the legalizing of industrial hemp. At a time when the public mood was anti cannabis, Harry was the first politician of power, to stand and risk his reputation, in order to help Manitoba farmers. The three experimental hemp plot trials he sanctioned in 1995, 1996, and 1997 yielded key information that convinced Health Canada to allow hemp crops to go to seed, which birthed the hemp food industry.  Later life  Enns died following heart surgery at the age of 78.

It is a 4-lane freeway in its entirety. The highway connects with Autoroute 85 at the border with Quebec and with Highway 104 at the border with Nova Scotia, as well as traffic from Interstate 95 via the Route 95 connector. Route 2 directly serves the cities of Edmundston, Fredericton and Moncton. A 20-year project to replace the original 1960s-era 2-lane Trans-Canada Highway with a 4-lane freeway was completed on November 1, 2007. The final upgrade to Route 2 and its short connector Route 95 has extended the continuous freeway network of North America east to New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. Once Autoroute 85 in Quebec is completed, Route 2 will also connect with the freeway networks of central Canada without passing through the United States. There is also Route 16 which connects P.E.I. to the mainland highway system. Route description Route 2 outside Moncton, New Brunswick. Note the wide median.The highway's western terminus is at the interprovincial boundary with Quebec 15 km north of Edmundston. It follows the lower section of the Madawaska River valley and enters the Saint John River valley where it passes north of Edmundston, running several kilometres inland from the east bank of the Saint John River, crossing the Rivi√®re Verte as it continues past Saint-L√©onard. At Grand Falls, the highway crosses to the west bank of the river and passes by Perth-Andover, Florenceville, and Hartland. At Woodstock the Saint John River turns east and the highway continues to parallel the river on a ridge several kilometres inland along the western bank. It passes south of Fredericton and Oromocto before crossing the northeastern edge of CFB Gagetown. The Saint John River turns south near Jemseg where the highway crosses the river on the Saint John River High Level Crossing and continues east over the Jemseg River using the Jemseg River Bridge. The highway leaves the river valleys as it continues east across the rolling hills south of Grand Lake and passes by Havelock, River Glade and Salisbury. The highway passes north and east of Moncton and Dieppe before turning south and passing by Memramcook, Sackville, and Aulac before reaching the eastern terminus at the inter-provincial boundary with Nova Scotia. History The 1901 Hartland Covered Bridge, used by Route 2 until the Hugh John Flemming Bridge opened in 1960 Route 2 was one of the initial routes defined in 1927,Commerce Reports: A Weekly Survey of Foreign Trade, Thirtieth Year (1927), Volume 1: Nos. 1-13, p. 177 running from Quebec at Quebec Route 2's terminus to Nova Scotia via Edmundston, Grand Falls, Woodstock, Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton. After a short crossing of the New Brunswick Panhandle alongside the Madawaska River to Edmundston, Route 2 closely followed the Saint John River all the way to Saint John, crossing three times - from the east to the west at Grand Falls, back to the east at Perth-Andover, and back to the west at Hartland (on the Hartland Covered Bridge). The road on the east side of the river between Edmundston and Grand Falls had just been opened in about 1926; previously travelers had to pass through Maine (US 1, SR 165, and Boundary Road) on the west side. A Route 2A cut the distance between Fredericton and Saint John via a poorer-quality but more direct road, intersecting Route 2 at Oromocto and Westfield. Beyond Saint John, Route 2 went northeast via Sussex to Moncton, and then turned southeast to cross the Nova Scotia border near Sackville.Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926, MaineAutomobile Blue Books, New Brunswick, 1926 and 1927Automobile Legal Association, Automobile Green Book, New Brunswick, 1929-30 The original path of Route 2 between Quebec and Sussex is now approximately the River Valley Scenic Drive.New Brunswick Department of Tourism and Parks, map of the River Valley Scenic Drive , accessed August 2007 Rand McNally Road Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico, 1946The Atlas of Canada, 3rd Edition, 1957: Major Roads, 1955 Hugh John Flemming BridgeWhen the route of the Trans-Canada Highway was defined in about 1950, it did not follow Route 2 via Saint John between Fredericton and Sussex, but took the more direct Route 9.James Montagnes, New York Times, Canada's Highways; Motorists Now Use Cross-Country Roads Being Integrated Into National Route, May 4, 1952, p. XX33 Through the late 1950s and 1960s, a number of bypasses and realignments, mostly two-lane, were built to improve Route 2 with federal Trans-Canada Highway funds. The first, built in the 1950s, was around Moncton, between southwest of Salisbury and Sackville. The old road through Moncton became Route 2A, then Route 6 in 1965, and is now Route 106. Next was the bypass around Woodstock. The road from Route 42 (now Route 560) at Jacksonville northeast to Route 2 (now Route 103) at Somerville was Route 2B by the late 1950s;United States Geological Survey 1:250000 topographic maps, Campbellton (1960), Woodstock (1959), and Fredericton (1957), accessed via TerraServer-USA with the 1960 completion of the Hugh John Flemming Bridge, just upstream from the Hartland Covered Bridge, and the extension of Route 2B south from Jacksonville to Route 2 (now Route 165) south of Woodstock, Route 2B became a realignment of Route 2, with old Route 2 through Woodstock becoming Route 2A (renumbered Route 103 in 1965). The initial bypass of Fredericton was also built in about 1960, including the 1959 Princess Margaret Bridge across the Saint John River, which replaced the Carleton Street Bridge for traffic to Route 8, 9, and Route 10. Traffic remaining on Route 2 to Saint John exited the bypass at what is now exit 7 for Route 7. Route 2 was moved to be identical with the Trans-Canada Highway, absorbing Route 9, in the 1965 renumbering of several New Brunswick highways. The old alignment via Saint John, where it did not become Route 7 (which replaced Route 2A) or an extension of Route 1, was renumbered as the new Route 102 between Oromocto and Westfield.Rand McNally Road Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico, 1964 and 1965 The majority of road development in New Brunswick follows settlement patterns which pre-dated motor transport, thus most communities developed along navigable waterways or were served by railways. The development of controlled access expressways only began in the 1960s and only around the largest communities. The majority of early provincial highway improvements merely consisted of upgrading local roads. Route 2 initially followed present-day Route 144 from the N.B.-Quebec interprovincial boundary to Edmundston and down the Saint John River Valley to Grand Falls. There, it crossed to the west bank of the Saint John River, and continued south to Florenceville where it crossed to the east bank to continue along present-day Route 105 to Hartland, then recrossed the river to the west bank which it followed present-day Routes 103, 165, and 102 to Fredericton in a southeast direction. At Fredericton a controlled-access 4-lane section was built around the city, and the highway crossed the Saint John River on the Princess Margaret Bridge to the east bank just south of the central business district. Following the river's east bank just metres above its water level (frequently flooded in spring freshets), the route continued south to Jemseg where the highway turned east along the southeast shore of Grand Lake to Youngs Cove Road where the highway turned south to Coles Island and on to Sussex. At Sussex the highway turned east again and passed by Petitcodiac and then by Salisbury. East of Salisbury, Route 2 followed local roads over a series of low hills north of Moncton, cresting at Lutes Mountain, before descending and following a controlled access section bypassing the city and Dieppe, skirting the edge of the Memramcook River valley and on to Sackville, then Aulac, and finally the N.B.-N.S. inter-provincial boundary. =Four-lane construction= Route 2 in York CountyFrom the early upgrades of these local roads in the 1960s under Trans-Canada Highway funding (which became designated Route 2) until the mid-1980s, very little was done to improve New Brunswick highways (aside from some re-alignment of Route 2 west of Fredericton with the flooding created by the Mactaquac Dam construction in 1968), leading to significant deterioration of the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick. By the mid-1980s Route 2 was a significant traffic hazard and a major embarrassment to the province. The provincial government changed in 1987 with the election of Premier Frank McKenna who was focused on improving the province's business climate. One of the government's major tasks was to revamp provincial transportation infrastructure and McKenna entered into aggressive negotiations with the federal government of prime minister Brian Mulroney to secure federal funding of new highway projects. McKenna viewed Route 2 (the Trans-Canada Highway) and Route 1 in New Brunswick as being partially a federal responsibility since they funnelled the majority of Atlantic Canada's highway traffic to the U.S. and central Canada. The signing of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989, coupled with federal approval for numerous railway line abandonments in the Maritimes during the 1980s, led to predictions of further highway traffic growth on New Brunswick highways in the 1990s. Under the remainder of the McKenna administration's years of power (until 1997), Route 2 saw significant upgrading to become a 4-lane expressway on heavily- travelled portions of the highway between the N.B.-N.S. inter-provincial boundary and Penobsquis (east of Sussex). Other isolated sections were also upgraded south of Grand Lake and between Edmundston and St. Leonard, as well as at Woodstock where an interchange connected to Interstate 95. =Major re- alignments= Route 2 eastbound, west of Edmundston Despite the upgrades, the uncontrolled-access sections of Route 2 were still a significant traffic hazard. Intensive lobbying from other provincial governments in the Atlantic provinces, as well as various trucking companies and business and transportation interests, asked that Route 2 be further upgraded. Unfortunately provincial finances could not handle the relatively large price tag required, even with the federal funding at the time. Fredericton‚ÄìMoncton Highway As a result, the final years of the McKenna administration saw a significant realignment of Route 2 proposed, running from Longs Creek, west of Fredericton, bypassing it and Oromocto to the west, and continuing southeast to Jemseg, where it would cross the Saint John River and connect with an existing four-lane section south of Grand Lake. From there the highway would again depart from its original alignment (which headed south to Sussex) and instead head due east to meet the existing Route 2 alignment at River Glade, east of Petitcodiac. of new, four-lane, controlled- access expressway would be privately financed and built, with the builder charging tolls for a 25-year period before the provincial government would gain control of the highway. In the late 1990s, an agreement was signed with a private consortium called Maritime Road Development Corporation (led by former provincial Liberal leader and former federal Minister of Transport Douglas Young) to build the new Route 2 alignment at an estimated cost of $1 billion (CAD). The toll issue was not without controversy as it, along with several other issues, led to the downfall of McKenna's successor, Camille Th√©riault, in 1999 to PC leader Bernard Lord. The highway was built, but tolls were removed from most portions of the highway before they opened. This portion of the privately built realignment of the Trans-Canada Highway has a hidden toll calculated by sensors in the pavement. The toll is instead charged to the provincial government, thus motorists do not directly pay for their highway usage. Along with a payment worth millions of dollars to get out of the original contract, the provincial government now makes all provincial taxpayers cover the cost of the highway when the original plan had been for a user-pay system under a toll structure. The new alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway opened in fall 2001 and at this time the portion of the old Route 2 alignment which ran between Sussex and River Glade was re-designated as part of Route 1, extending the eastern terminus of that highway approximately . The re-alignment also had the effect of shortening the total length of Route 2 in the province by approximately . Other re-designations included a section between Youngs Cove and Sussex which became part of Route 10, a section between Youngs Cove and Fredericton became part of Route 105, and section across the Princess Margaret Bridge and Fredericton bypass became part of Route 8. The re-alignment and construction of Route 2 between Longs Creek and River Glade \\"catapulted\\" New Brunswick highways forward by decades virtually overnight. The road was designed with medians, extensive wildlife fencing and underpasses, rumble strips along emergency breakdown lanes, paved emergency U-turn areas, sensors beneath the asphalt for monitoring truck weights as well as local weather and road surface conditions, extensive guard rails and reflectors, as well as two major bridges: the Saint John River High Level Crossing and the nearby Jemseg River Bridge. Suddenly it was now possible to travel from Fredericton into Nova Scotia (and on to Halifax or New Glasgow) completely on a four-lane controlled access highway. The Fredericton-Moncton section was officially opened to traffic at 10am on October 24, 2001, five weeks ahead of schedule. Fredericton‚Äì‚ÄìGrand Falls The high quality of construction of the new Route 2 alignment and improvement in the provincial highway system was not unnoticed by the new government of premier Bernard Lord. Throughout 2000-2003, several small four-lane controlled access sections on Route 2 between Fredericton and Edmundston were opened, most requiring construction of a new alignment. During this same period, negotiations were undertaken with the federal government to secure funding to complete the last, and one of the most costly parts of the new construction‚Äîa gap between Woodstock and Grand Falls over the Appalachian Mountains (bypassing present- day Routes 165, 103 and 130), and a gap between Longs Creek and Pokiok (bypassing present-day Route 102), west of Fredericton. In August, 2003 a joint announcement was made by Premier Lord and Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien for a $400 million (CAD) agreement to complete upgrades to the last remaining non-controlled access section of Route 2\\\\. The Pokiok-Longs Creek section had been independently contracted by the provincial government and opened in November 2006. However, the provincial government sought to construct the remaining gap as part of a complete \\"design-build-finance-operate-maintain- rehabilitate\\" plan which would see large private sector consortia bid for the right to design and construct the 98 km of new highway for Route 2, as well as to operate the entire section of Route 2 between Longs Creek, where it abuts the hidden-toll highway section built and operated by Maritime Road Development Corporation, and the Quebec‚ÄìNew Brunswick border as well as all of Route 95\\\\. The winning consortium was Brun-Way Group, a joint venture by Atcon Construction and SNC-Lavalin. Brun-Way Group has two subsidiaries, Brun-Way Construction Inc., which received the ~$540 million to complete the 98 km of new construction as well as selected upgrades to other sections of Route 2 between Longs Creek and the Quebec border, and Brun-Way Highway Operations Inc., which will receive an annual payment from the government of New Brunswick until 2033 to operate and maintain this section of the highway. This agreement will place fully 85% of the maintenance of Route 2 and 100% of Route 95 in the hands of the consortia Brun-Way and MRDC. The construction of the last segment of four-lane Route 2 was completed by Brun-Way on November 1, 2007. This construction saw a completely new alignment built north of Woodstock, staying several kilometres inland from the Saint John River's west bank, and paralleling the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border north to Grand Falls, where it crosses to the east bank of the river and connects with existing four-lane upgrades to Route 2 through to the Quebec boundary.

Early life: 1769‚Äì1815 Sibley was born in Sutton, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth and Reuben Sibley. After completing preparatory studies, he graduated from the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now Brown University) at Providence in 1794. He studied law, was admitted to the Bar in 1795 and began a practice in Marietta, Ohio, which was then part of the Northwest Territory. He soon moved to Cincinnati and then moved again to Detroit, Michigan in 1797, shortly after the British handed over the fort in 1796. When he arrived, Sibley was one of only two lawyers in Detroit. Being a pioneer lawyer was a physically challenging profession, often requiring long travel by horseback through wilderness over Indian trails in all types of weather to attend the territorial courts in Cincinnati, Marietta, or Chillicothe, Ohio. In December, 1798, Detroit elected a delegate to the legislature of the Northwest Territory. This, the first election in Michigan under United States control, was held in a Detroit tavern. Although Sibley was elected, his opponent, James May, claimed he had won by providing liquor for the voters. Despite the protestation, Sibley represented Wayne County in the first legislature of the Northwest Territory, commencing his term in January 1799. Sibley was instrumental in passing the legislation in 1802 by which Detroit was incorporated as a town. Sibley was elected first as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and then under the first city charter of 1806 as the first mayor of Detroit. During the War of 1812, Sibley commanded a company of riflemen in defense of Detroit, though the British attack was successful and William Hull surrendered the fort. After the war, Sibley served as Auditor of Public Accounts for the Michigan Territory from 1814 to 1817. Congressional delegate: 1815‚Äì1823 Sibley was appointed as the first United States Attorney for the Michigan Territory by U.S. President James Madison, serving from 1815 to 1823. When William Woodbridge resigned on August 9, 1820 as territorial Delegate to the 16th United States Congress, Sibley was elected to fill the vacancy. Sibley won re-election to the 17th Congress, serving in total from November 20, 1820 to March 3, 1823. Sibley continued to serve as U.S. Attorney, and thus held concurrent legislative and executive positions. During this period, Sibley was also commissioned, along with Lewis Cass, to negotiate the August 29, 1821, Treaty of Chicago with the Ottawa, Potawatomi, and Chippewa, in which the tribes ceded most of their territory south of the Grand River. Michigan Supreme Court: 1824‚Äì1837 Sibley was not a candidate for re-election to Congress in 1822. In 1824, he was appointed as one of three justices on the Michigan Territorial Supreme Court by U.S. President James Monroe, becoming the sixth Territorial Justice. From 1827 until 1837, when he had to resign due to deafness, Sibley was Chief Justice of the court. Retirement and personal life: 1837‚Äì1846 Sibley married Sarah Whipple Sproat Sibley (1782‚Äì1851), the only daughter of Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. They had eight children, one of whom, Henry Hastings Sibley (b. 1811), was a territorial delegate from Wisconsin Territory, 1848‚Äì1849 and from Minnesota Territory, 1849‚Äì1853 and the first Governor of Minnesota, 1858‚Äì1860. A second son, Alexander H. Sibley (b. 1817), was the president of the Silver Islet Mining Company which operated a silver mine in Ontario. A daughter, Catherine Whipple Sibley, married Charles Christopher Trowbridge, mayor of Detroit in 1834 and unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Michigan in 1837. Sibley died in Detroit and is interred in Elmwood Cemetery there. Upon his death, many members of the Bar wore a badge of mourning for 30 days. Shortly after his death, his widow Sarah built the Sibley House on Jefferson, which still stands.

Before its 2016 corporate restructuring, Areva was majority-owned by the French stateCarol Matlack, Areva is costing France plenty, Bloomberg Businessweek, 17 April 2015. through the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (54.37%), Banque publique d'investissement (3.32%), and Agence des participations de l'√âtat (28.83%). √âlectricit√© de France, of which the French government has a majority ownership stake, owned 2.24%; Kuwait Investment Authority owned 4.82% as the second largest shareholder after the French state. The company was listed at the European stock exchange Euronext. As a part of the restructuring program following its insolvency, Areva sold out or discontinued its renewable energy businesses, sold its reactors business subsidiary Areva NP (now: Framatome) to EDF and its nuclear propulsion and research reactors subsidiary Areva TA (now: Technicatome) to Agence des participations de l'√âtat, and separated its nuclear cycle business into a separate company New Areva (later: Orano). As a result, Areva S.A. became wholly state-owned by the French government, remaining responsible only for the liabilities related to the Olkiluoto 3 project in Finland and holding a 40% stake in Orano. History =Creation= Former Areva headquarters, rue Lafayette in Paris Areva was created on 3 April 2001 by the merger of Framatome (later: Areva NP, now: Framatome), Cogema (later: Areva NC, now: Orano Cycle) and Technicatome (later: Areva TA, now: Techicatome). It was based on the structure of its precursor, CEA-Industrie. Anne Lauvergeon became its first CEO. Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the former Prime Minister of France, announced the privatization of Areva in 2003, but it was postponed several times, the French government opting finally for the privatization of GDF and EDF. At the end of October 2005, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin announced that he had suspended the privatization process. In 2003, Areva secured a contract for the Olkiluoto 3 project, which foresaw construction of the third generation EPR- type pressurised water reactor. In 2004 a contracted fixed price was established as ‚Ç¨3.2 billion. Construction started in 2005. In 2004, Areva acquired Alstom's transmission and distribution activities, which became Areva T&D.; It was sold back to Alstom and Schneider Electric in June 2010. On 15 September 2005, Areva and Constellation Energy of Baltimore announced a joint venture called UniStar Nuclear to market the commercial EPR in the United States. The joint venture later became UniStar Nuclear Energy in 2007. In 2010, EDF acquired 100% of UniStar Nuclear Energy. However these plans failed to come to fruition, and in February 2015 Areva suspended the EPR Design Certification Application Review process at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In 2006, Areva created its renewable energies business group. Creusot Forge and Creusot M√©canique merged into the Areva group, even though there were quality concerns over Creusot Forge's work. In 2007, Areva purchased 51% of offshore wind turbine manufacturer Multibrid. In June 2010, Areva purchased the remaining 49% and formed Areva Wind. In February 2010, Areva bought Ausra, and renamed it Areva Solar. In 2007, Areva purchased UraMin, which later became Areva Resources Southern Africa (now part of Orano). In 2007, Areva started construction of the Flamanville 3 EPR reactor. In addition, in November 2007 Areva agreed to a ‚Ç¨8 billion deal with the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group to supply them with two EPRs for Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. Under the terms of the agreement, Areva also had to help operate the plant, including the reprocessing of spent fuel.John Tagliabue, The New York Times, 27 November 2007 \\"China Deal Gives Lift to Revival of Fission\\". Also in 2007, Areva and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries created a joint venture named Atmea to develop a 1,100 MWe Atmea-1 pressurised water reactor (Generation III reactor). In 2009, Siemens sold its remaining shares of Areva NP and Arvea NP became wholly owned by Areva. At the same year, Areva NP acquired 30% stake in the Mitsubishi Nuclear Fuel company. On 6 May 2008, Areva announced that it would seek all necessary approval to build an enrichment facility in Bonneville County, Idaho. The project was later cancelled. Also in 2008, Areva was awarded an operations contract to clean up the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site as part of the Nuclear Management Partners consortium, made up of URS, Amec and Areva. In June 2008, Areva reached an agreement with Kazatomprom to create a joint-venture Katco. On 4 February 2009, Areva signed a memorandum to supply two to six nuclear reactors to the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited for the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in the Indian state of Maharashtra. In March 2010, Areva indicated work was being done on a new type of burner reactor type capable of breaking down actinides created as a product of nuclear fission.Robin Pagnamenta, The Times, 22 March 2010, Areva develops new nuclear reactors that 'destroy' atomic waste, The Australian In 2011, Areva was listed at the Euronext stock exchange in Paris. =Post-Fukushima problems= In December 2011, Areva suspended building work at several sites in France, Africa and the United States, one day after forecasting a ‚Ç¨1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) loss. Areva halted \\"capacity extensions\\" at its La Hague Reprocessing Plant, in northern France, at its Melox factory in the southwest, and at two sites attached to its Tricastin power plant in the south. Work has also stopped on extensions to uranium mines in Bakouma in the Central African Republic, Trekkopje in Namibia, and Ryst Kuil in South Africa, and caused a potential delay in construction until a capital solution is secured for the Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility in the United States. Areva wrote off most of the $2.5 billion purchase cost of Canadian uranium mining company Uramin, purchased in 2007, after concluding that its uranium ore deposits were of negligible value. In September 2014 Standard & Poor's stated it might downgrade Areva's credit rating following weak first-half results, leading to Areva indicating it would cut capital spending and dispose of some assets. In March 2015 Standard & Poor's further downgraded Areva's credit rating to BB- after Areva posted a ‚Ç¨4.8 billion loss for 2014. In 2012, Areva acquired a hydrogen technology developer Compagnie europ√©enne des technologies de l'hydrog√®ne (CETH) and renamed it Areva H2Gen. At the same year, it inaugurated a hydrogen storage system called the MYRTE platform near Ajaccio, Corsica (MYRTE is the French acronym for Mission Hydrog√®ne Renouvelable pour l‚Äôint√©gration au r√©seau √©lectrique). The system aims to establish the feasibility of a storage solution for solar energy using hydrogen technologies, which would serve as a back-up system to stabilize Corsica's power grid. In 2014, Areva's energy storage and management system, the Greenergy Box, was added to the existing installation, in operation since early 2013. In January 2014, Areva and Spain's wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa Corporaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica created on the bases of Areva Wind a joint venture Adwen. In August 2014, Areva exited the solar industry. In October 2013, Areva won a $2.7 billion contract to supply two EPR nuclear reactors and control systems to the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, England. In December 2013, Areva and China General Nuclear Power (CGN) agreed to a partnership in renewable energy, with a focus on offshore wind, biomass, concentrated solar power, and energy storage. In October 2014, CEO Luc Oursel took a leave of absence for health reasons. He died in December of the same year. On 20 November 2014 Standard & Poor's downgraded Areva long-term debt to BB+ and short-term-debt to A-3. In May 2014, Areva through its subsidiary CETH2, and the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency), announced the creation of the AREVA H2-Gen joint venture. In December 2015 operations at Le Creusot Forge were stopped following a discovery at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. About 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply. In December 2016 international inspectors found evidence of recent doctored paperwork, which had not been detected by Areva's independent quality control checks. In April 2017 Autorit√© de s√ªret√© nucl√©aire (ASN) published the requirements for forging to resume at Le Creusot Forge. In August 2017 ASN published a draft decision requiring the examination of Le Creusot Forge manufacturing records of all components during scheduled reactor refuelling outages. =Restructuring= In June 2016 Areva's restructuring plans were made public, including the sale of the majority of its reactor business to EDF in 2017, excluding the Olkiluoto 3 EPR under construction in Finland which will remain with Areva SA. In December 2017, Areva and EDF signed agreements on the transfer of Areva NP's nuclear reactor operations. As part of the restructuring plan, Areva created a new fuel cycle company, dubbed as New Co or New Areva. The new company combined Areva Mines, Areva NC, Areva Projects, and Areva Business Support companies. It was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of Areva; however, Areva lost control over the company as the French government invested to recapitalize the company. On 23 January 2018 that company changed its name to Orano. In January 2017, Areva sold its stake in the wind turbine manufacturer Adwen. In March 2017, Areva sold its nuclear propulsion and research reactor subsidiary Areva TA to Agence des Participations de l'Etat. Current operations Olkiluoto-3 under construction in 2009 , Areva S.A. is responsible only for the liabilities related to the Olkiluoto 3 project. The reactor, which is one of the first of the new Generation III reactors, was initially expected to begin producing electricity in 2009, but the project has delayed at least until 2020, and it has faced several price increases. Areva and TVO have reached an agreement, according to which Areva would pay ‚Ç¨450 million in compensation over the delays and lost income. The agreement would settle all legal actions between the two companies. Areva also holds of 40% stake in Orano. Past operations Areva was a company with a presence in each industrial activity linked to nuclear energy: mining, chemistry, enrichment, fuel assembly, reprocessing, engineering, nuclear propulsion and reactors, treatment, recycling, stabilization and dismantling. Areva also offered technological solutions for renewable energy. Areva's activities were divided into five business groups. =Nuclear operations= The mining business group managed the exploration of uranium ore, its extraction, and processing, as well as the restoration of sites after mine closure. It had staff on five continents and operated uranium production sites in Canada, Kazakhstan, and Niger. As of the end of 2013, the Mining Business Group employed 4,463 people. Uranium production accounted for 19% of Areva's consolidated revenue in 2013. It is now part of Orano. The front end business group provided access to fuel for Areva's customers, and oversees operations to convert uranium into nuclear fuel, including the chemical conversion of ore into uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of uranium, and the design and production of fuel for nuclear reactors. As of the end of 2013, 8,555 people worked for Areva's front end business group. It accounted for 24% of Areva's consolidated revenue in 2013. It is now part of Orano. The reactors and services business group designed and built pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors, and offers products to service nuclear reactors. It is now part of Framatome. The business group also designed and built naval propulsion and research reactors, which is now Technicatome. The business group had 15,592 employees at the end of 2013 and generated 36% of Areva's revenue in the same year. The back end business group developed recycling solutions for used fuel for reuse in reactors. It also offered storage and transportation solutions for radioactive material, and site rehabilitation at nuclear facilities. Its is now part of Orano. At the end of 2013, it had 11,583 employees and made up for 19% of Areva's revenue. In 2017 the NUHOMS Matrix advanced used nuclear fuel storage overpack, a high- density system for storing multiple spent fuel rods in canisters, was launched. =Renewable energy operations= Areva created its global renewable energies business group in 2006 as an expansion of its clean energy portfolio with renewable energy. This group represented four business lines: concentrated solar power, offshore wind power, biomass power, and hydrogen power storage and distribution. Areva built biomass power plants worldwide, representing 2.5 GWe of installed capacity. These plants located in Brazil, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, India and Thailand. Its subsidiary Areva Renewables Brazil built biomass power plants based on bagasse (organic waste from sugar cane). In the United States, Areva formed a partnership with Duke Energy to build and operate 55 MW biomass power plants based on wood waste. Areva acquired a bio-coal production technology called Thermya, which produces a biofuel issued from biomass torrefaction that can replace coal to generate thermal energy and electricity. Areva also developed AdCub, a modular concept for compact power plants targeting small-scale biomass resources that addresses relatively untapped growth opportunities in Europe. The objective is to combine innovative solutions which optimize customer costs for small-scale power plants (between 3 and 6 MW) and reduce construction time. This new biomass plant concept also aims to improve upstream technologies for multi- fuel acceptance and higher availability. Areva designed, manufactured and industrialized turnkey energy storage solutions and products to generate electricity with fuel cells and produce hydrogen by electrolysis. Areva supported research in the hydrogen field through partnerships with a number of industrial companies and national research organizations including Agence Nationale de la Recherche, the Horizon Hydrogen Energy (H2E) program, PAN-H (Plan d'Action National sur l'Hydrog√®ne et les piles √† combustible) and P√¥le Capenergies, an innovation cluster dedicated to the development of renewable forms of energy without greenhouse gas emissions. =Other operations= Areva was involved in military technology, such as designing the nuclear reactor for the French Barracuda class submarine. One of Areva's subsidiaries, Euriware (founded in 1991) was specialized in consulting and IT services and employs 2,200 people. Areva also owned 1.99% of Safran and 1.4% of Suez Environnement. CERCA, a subsidiary of Areva that produces fuel for research reactors, was also involved in TRIGA, a research reactor established in 1996 with the US firm General Atomics that is used for training, research, and the production of radioisotopes. Areva was a former corporate member of the Bruegel think tank. Notable incidents =2007 fine= In January 2007, Areva was fined ‚Ç¨53 million by the European Commission for rigging EU electricity markets through a cartel involving 11 companies, including ABB, Alstom, Fuji, Hitachi Japan, AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech ELIN.EU cracks down on electricity-gear cartel, EurActiv, 25 January 2007 . According to the Commission, \\"between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.\\" Areva is not accused of any cartel involvement other than through the acquisition of an Alstom unit in January 2004. \\"This subsidiary was acquired by the Areva group towards the end of the infringement, in January 2004. The parent entities of the Areva group share a joint liability with that subsidiary for the period after its acquisition.\\"Competition: Commission fines members of gas insulated switchgear cartel over 750 million euros IP/07/80 Brussels, 24 January 2007, Press Releases ‚Äì EUROPA \\"A few months before the cartel ended, Alstom sold the unit involved to Areva, which knew nothing of the cartel. It [Areva] and Alstom have joint liability for 53.6 million, which they must decide how to split.\\" EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes declared that \\"The commission has put an end to a cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years\\".Vote call by Siemens shareholders, BBC, 25 January 2007 = Libya deal = On 13 August 2007, the French newspaper Le Parisien alleged that the Franco-Libyan civil nuclear power agreement signed by President Nicolas Sarkozy did not concern desalinization of sea water, as claimed by the French government, but instead focused in particular on selling the EPR to Libya, a contract potentially worth $3 billion.Marc Lomazzi, Le Parisien, 13 August 2007 \\"Nucl√©aire: les dessous de l'accord entre la France et la Libye\\" . Le Parisien cited Philippe Delaune, deputy to the deputy director of international affairs for the CEA atomic agency, which is the main share-holder in Areva. Following allegations that the deal had been related to the release of the Bulgarian nurses, the French Socialist Party, through the spokesperson Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was \\"geopolitically irresponsible\\". The German government also denounced the agreement. =Bakouma assault= On 24 June 2012, an armed group assaulted a uranium plant operated by Areva at Bakouma in the southeast of the Central African Republic. A statement by the military described that \\"a violent clash on Sunday afternoon pitted\\" Central African troops against \\"an unidentified group of armed men attempting to launch an assault on the site of mining company Areva\\". According to the report the army successfully repelled the attack, but \\"the enemy did some material damage and pulled back while taking a sizeable quantity mainly of food with them.\\" The Areva group issued no immediate statement regarding the attack. Central African military sources believe that the attack was organized by members of the Chadian rebel group Popular Front for Recovery (FPR) led by 'General' Baba Ladde, which has been active in the region since 2008. The army says it's conducting further operations to neutralize the remaining armed rebels in the region of Bakouma. =Attack in Niger= In May 2013, the company's uranium mine in Niger was damaged and one civilian was killed in an Al-Qaeda-linked suicide bomb attack. The mine reached full production again in August 2013. =Tuareg people= In November 2009, Greenpeace released a report indicating that two villages near Areva's mining operations in Niger had dangerously high levels of radiation.RFI.fiLeft in the Dust ‚Äì uranium mining in Niger // GreenpeaceVideo. YouTube. In January 2014, Al Jazeera produced Orphans of the Sahara, three-part series on the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert, in which claims were brought to light that Areva mining and consequent irradiations are causing diseases and deaths among their people. Al Jazeera also published Areva's response, in which the company said it submits regular reports on its environmental monitoring of water, air and soil to the Nigerien Office of Environmental Assessments and Impact Studies (BEEEI) which indicate that there is no pollution around the sites in question. Corporate issues =Name etymology= The name Areva was derived from the name of the Cistercian Abbey of Arevalo. =Sport sponsorship= Areva sponsored several sporting events over the years. In 2009, Areva launched Athlenergy.com, an online resource for runners, and became the sponsor of the French Athletics Federation and the official sponsor of Meeting Areva, a track and field competition held annually at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France. In May 2014, Athlenergy.com became Arevarun. Areva also sponsors several running events, including the Paris Half Marathon and Saint√©lyon, a night run from Sainte Etienne to Lyon, in France. In 2008, Areva signed a contract to sponsor the German football club FC N√ºrnberg until 2012. The contract was completed in 2012. Areva sponsored the French \\"Defi Areva\\" team in the 2002 America's Cup race, and the French \\"Areva Challenge\\" team in the 2007 America's Cup race. In 2002, during its first public appearance, in Lorient, France, the \\"Defi Areva\\" yacht collided with a dinghy carrying four Greenpeace protesters, and the impact knocked a hole in the side of the 80-foot boat.

Biography Neumann was born in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia, as the son of the mineralogist, physicist and mathematician Franz Ernst Neumann (1798-1895), who was professor of mineralogy and physics at K√∂nigsberg University. Carl Neumann studied in K√∂nigsberg and Halle and was a professor at the universities of Halle, Basel, T√ºbingen, and Leipzig. While in K√∂nigsberg, he studied physics with his father, and later as a working mathematician, dealt almost exclusively with problems arising from physics. Stimulated by Bernhard Riemann's work on electrodynamics, Neumann developed a theory founded on the finite propagation of electrodynamic actions, which interested Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Clausius into striking up a correspondence with him. Weber described Neumann's professorship at Leipzig as for \\"higher mechanics, which essentially encompasses mathematical physics,\\" and his lectures did so.Christa Jungnickel, Russell McCormmach, Intellectual Mastery of Nature. Theoretical Physics from Ohm to Einstein (1990) Vol. 1. p. 181. Maxwell makes reference to the electrodynamic theory developed by Weber and Neumann in the Introduction to A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field (1864). Neumann worked on the Dirichlet principle, and can be considered one of the initiators of the theory of integral equations. The Neumann series, which is analogous to the geometric series : \\\\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \\\\cdots but for infinite matrices or for bounded operators, is named after him. Together with Alfred Clebsch, Neumann founded the mathematical research journal Mathematische Annalen. He died in Leipzig. The Neumann boundary condition for certain types of ordinary and partial differential equations is named after him (Cheng and Cheng, 2005).

Directed by Alexander Mackendrick and written by William Rose, it is a story of a clash of cultures between a hard-driving American businessman and a wily Scottish captain. The story was inspired by Neil Munro's short stories of the Vital Spark and her captain, Para Handy. Plot The Maggie is a typical Clyde puffer, a small, aged cargo boat with a varied, irascible and argumentative crew. MacTaggart (Alex Mackenzie), her rascal of a captain, is in dire need of ¬£300 to renew his licence. In a shipping office in Glasgow, he overhears Mr Pusey (Hubert Gregg), an Englishman complete with bowler hat and umbrella, trying to arrange for the transportation of some personal furniture for his boss, American Calvin B. Marshall (Paul Douglas). The big, reputable shipping company has nothing immediately available, so MacTaggart gets the job when Pusey mistakenly believes that he works for the company and that the more modern vessel docked next to the Maggie is MacTaggart's. Marshall is a wealthy industrialist, a stubborn and determined self-made man. When he eventually learns the truth, he sets out in pursuit by aeroplane and hired car. Catching up with the puffer, he puts Pusey on board to ensure the cargo is transferred to another boat. But his underling is no match for the captain; he ends up in jail on a charge of poaching. Marshall realizes that he will have to handle the matter personally. After another costly chase, he boards the boat himself to spur the cargo transfer. However, the route and timing of the voyage are governed by MacTaggart, tidal variations and local community priorities. Marshall's hostile attitude gradually softens somewhat. He is particularly touched by the loyalty of the \\"wee boy\\", Dougie (Tommy Kearins), to his captain. At one point, when Marshall threatens to buy the boat from the owner, MacTaggart's sister, and sell it for scrap, Dougie drops a board on him, knocking him unconscious. His mood changes again when the wily Mactaggart moors the puffer under a wooden jetty; as the tide rises, the jetty (due for dismantling anyway) is damaged, making it impossible to transfer the furniture to the deeper draught vessel when it arrives. At one of the unscheduled stops, the crew attend the hundredth birthday party of an islander, and Marshall chats with a nineteen-year-old girl who is pondering her future. She has two suitors, an up-and-coming, ambitious store owner and a poor fisherman. The American advises her to choose the former, but she believes she will marry the latter, explaining that he will give her his time, rather than just things. This strikes a chord with Marshall. He is having marital difficulties, and the furniture is an attempt to patch things up with his wife. As they finally near their destination, the engine fails. Marshall manages to repair the old, poorly maintained machinery, but it is too late. The Maggie is driven by wind and tide onto some rocks. Marshall asks MacTaggart if they can save her by jettisoning the cargo. MacTaggart then apologetically informs him that he neglected to insure the furniture, but Marshall orders it thrown overboard anyway. The Maggie is saved. At journey's end, Marshall, with some prodding by Dougie, even allows MacTaggart to keep the money he so desperately needs. In appreciation of his magnanimity, MacTaggart renames his boat the Calvin B. Marshall. Cast *Alex Mackenzie as Captain MacTaggart *Paul Douglas as Calvin B.

Formally, given a finite set X, a collection C of subsets of X, has Property B if we can partition X into two disjoint subsets Y and Z such that every set in C meets both Y and Z. The property gets its name from mathematician Felix Bernstein, who first introduced the property in 1908.. Property B is equivalent to 2-coloring the hypergraph described by the collection C. A hypergraph with property B is also called 2-colorable. Sometimes it is also called bipartite, by analogy to the bipartite graphs. Property B is often studied for uniform hypergraphs (set systems in which all subsets of the system have the same cardinality) but it has also been considered in the non-uniform case.  Smallest set-families without property B  The smallest number of sets in a collection of sets of size n such that C does not have Property B is denoted by m(n). = Known values of m(n) = It is known that m(1) = 1, m(2) = 3, and m(3) = 7 (as can by seen by the following examples); the value of m(4) = 23 (√ñsterg√•rd), although finding this result was the result of an exhaustive search. An upper bound of 23 (Seymour, Toft) and a lower bound of 21 (Manning) have been proven. At the time of this writing (March 2017), there is no OEIS entry for the sequence m(n) yet, due to the lack of terms known. ; m(1) : For n = 1, set X = {1}, and C = . Then C does not have Property B. ; m(2) : For n = 2, set X = {1, 2, 3} and C = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}} (a triangle). Then C does not have Property B, so m(2) <= 3. However, C' = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}} does (set Y = {1} and Z = {2, 3}), so m(2) >= 3. ; m(3) : For n = 3, set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and C = {{1, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {3, 4, 6}, {4, 5, 7}, {5, 6, 1}, {6, 7, 2}, {7, 1, 3}} (the Steiner triple system S7); C does not have Property B (so m(3) <= 7), but if any element of C is omitted, then that element can be taken as Y, and the set of remaining elements C' will have Property B (so for this particular case, m(3) >= 7). One may check all other collections of 6 3-sets to see that all have Property B. ; m(4) : √ñsterg√•rd (2014) through an exhaustive search found m(4) = 23. Seymour (1974) constructed a hypergraph on 11 vertices with 23 edges without Property B, which shows that m(4) <= 23. Manning (1995) narrowed the floor such that m(4) >= 21. = Asymptotics of m(n) = Erd≈ës (1963) proved that for any collection of fewer than 2^{n-1} sets of size n, there exists a 2-coloring in which all set are bichromatic. The proof is simple: Consider a random coloring. The probability that an arbitrary set is monochromatic is 2^{-n+1}. By a union bound, the probability that there exist a monochromatic set is less than 2^{n-1}2^{-n+1} = 1. Therefore, there exists a good coloring. Erd≈ës (1964) showed the existence of an n-uniform hypergraph with O(2^n \\\\cdot n^2) hyperedges which does not have property B (i.e., does not have a 2-coloring in which all hyperedges are bichromatic), establishing an upper bound. Schmidt (1963) proved that every collection of at most n/(n+4)\\\\cdot 2^n sets of size n has property B. Erd≈ës and Lov√°sz conjectured that m(n) = \\\\theta(2^n \\\\cdot n). Beck in 1978 improved the lower bound to m(n) = \\\\Omega(n^{1/3 - \\\\epsilon}2^n), where \\\\epsilon is an arbitrary small positive number. In 2000, Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan improved the lower bound to m(n) = \\\\Omega(2^n \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{n / \\\\log n}). They used a clever probabilistic algorithm.

The Vital Spark is a fictional Clyde puffer, created by Scottish writer Neil Munro. As its captain, the redoubtable Para Handy, often says: \\"the smertest boat in the coastin' tred\\". Background Puffers seem to have been regarded fondly even before Munro began publishing his short stories in the Glasgow Evening News in 1905. This may not be surprising, for these small steamboats were then providing a vital supply link around the west coast and Hebrides islands of Scotland. The charming rascality of the stories went well beyond the reality of a commercial shipping business, but they brought widespread fame. They appeared in the newspaper over 20 years, were collected in book form by 1931, inspired the 1953 film The Maggie, and came out as three popular television series, dating from 1959 to 1995. Description The deck of a \\"puffer\\". In her captain's own (islands accented) words, the Vital Spark is \\"aal hold, with the boiler behind, four men and a derrick, and a watter-butt and a pan loaf in the foc'sle\\". The way these steam lighters with their steam-powered derricks could offload at any suitable beach or small pier is featured in many Vital Spark stories, and allows amusing escapades in the small west coast communities. The cargoes carried in the hold vary from gravel or coal to furniture to livestock, the crew's quarters in the forecastle are taken as lodgings by holidaymakers or lost children and the steam engine struggles on under the dour care of the engineer McPhail. Tales are recounted of improbably dramatic missions in World War I. Others scoff at her as a coal gaabbert, reflecting the origins of the puffers, but an indignant Para Handy is always ready to defend his boat, proudly comparing her speed and her looks with the glamorous Clyde steamers. TV series featuring Vital Spark The original BBC Series Para Handy - Master Mariner, which ran from 1959‚Äì60, starred Duncan Macrae (Para Handy), Roddy McMillan (The Mate), and John Grieve (Dan MacPhail, the engineer). Six episodes were made, none of which survive. In 1963 Macrae, McMillan and Grieve, accompanied by Alex Mackenzie and guitarist George Hill, recorded an album of songs, Highland Voyage. A short film was made to accompany the recording, filmed on board a puffer as it cruised around the Firth of Clyde. Macrae and McMillan appear as The Captain and The Mate, while Mackenzie appears as The Engineer, causing Grieve to move to play The Cook. Although very obviously based on Munro's characters, the names of Para Handy, the Vital Spark, etc. are never mentioned, probably due to copyright issues. In the second version, The Vital Spark, McMillan took the role of Para Handy, and Grieve reprised his role as McPhail; Walter Carr (Dougie the Mate) and Alex McAvoy (Sunny Jim) completed the crew, and the series ran for three series between 1965 and 1974. The third series, made several years after the first two, was in colour and consisted of remakes of selected earlier episodes. In 1994 BBC Scotland produced The Tales of Para Handy which starred Gregor Fisher in the lead role alongside Sean Scanlan as Dougie, Andrew Fairlie as Sunny Jim and Rikki Fulton as Dan McPhail. This ran for two series, a total of nine episodes, in 1994 and 1995. The series also featured David Tennant in one of his first acting roles. Alex McAvoy, who played Sunny Jim in The Vital Spark, appears in one episode as a fellow captain of Para Handy in the coastal trade. Ships depicting Vital Spark Eilean Eisdeal dressed as the Vital Spark. The stories sparked considerable interest in the puffers, and many books explore their now vanished world. In the third television series, The Tales of Para Handy, the Vital Spark was depicted by the puffer Auld Reekie (VIC 27). She is moored at Crinan awaiting restoration.VIC 27 at Clyde Maritime; retrieved 13 February 2018 When VIC 72, renamed Eilean Eisdeal, ventured from her home at the Inveraray Maritime Museum to visit the Glasgow River Festival in 2005, she proudly bore the name Vital Spark in testimony to her continuing popularity. Now in 2006 she proudly is the Vital Spark of Glasgow having been successfully re-registered. The Argyll brewer Fyne Ales, situated close to Inveraray, where the current boat rests and Neil Munro was born, produces a beer called Vital Spark in tribute to the series. In December 2007, the Vital Spark Clyde puffer returned to the Forth and Clyde Canal - the place of her 'birth', as reported on STV news' Reporting Scotland. The puffer now sits on the slip way at Crinan boatyard awaiting restoration. A ship dressed as the Vital Spark at Crinan, in Argyll and Bute.

Hoover flew Spitfires in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and was shot down in 1944 off the coast of France. He was held for over a year in a German POW camp before eventually escaping and flying to safety in a stolen enemy aircraft. He then worked as a United States Air Force and civilian test pilot after the war, flying chase for the Bell X-1 supersonic flight, and as a flight instructor for North American Aviation during the Korean War. He is best known as an air show display pilot, who flew for nearly 50 years until his retirement in 1999.

He enlisted in the Tennessee National Guard and was sent for pilot training with the United States Army.Hoover 1997, p. 17. During World War II, Hoover was sent to Casablanca, where his first major assignment was flight testing the assembled aircraft ready for service. He was later assigned to the Supermarine Spitfire-equipped 52d Fighter Group in Sicily.Hoover 1997, p. 50. On February 9, 1944, on his 59th mission, his malfunctioning Mark V Spitfire was shot down by Siegfried Lemke, a pilot of Jagdgeschwader 2 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 off the coast of Southern France, and he was taken prisoner.Hoover 1997, pp. 65‚Äì67. He spent 16 months at Stalag Luft 1, a German prisoner-of-war camp in Barth, Germany.Hoover 1997, p. 90. One night due to the conditions in the camp there was a riot and fight involving several thousand inmates and Hoover used this opportunity to scale the fence and escape, despite the fact that Dwight Eisenhower had issued the order for prisoners to no longer attempt to escape due to the rapid advance of the Allies.He was joined by two other POW's and together they made their way down a dirt road to a German farmhouse where a lone woman made the starving men some food. As they were leaving Hoover wrote a note for her to give to the American army in the coming weeks stating that she had assisted the three of them, and to treat her kindly. The woman also gave the trio a handgun with several clips of ammunition. The men then obtained bicycles and rode for several miles before they came across a seemingly abandoned airfield. Hoover being a pilot began inspecting the planes but they all seemed damaged and unworthy of flight. He eventually found a reconnaissance plane, a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, with some damage, but a full tank of fuel. A German mechanic stunned the trio sneaking up on them demanding they halt but almost immediately had a gun pointed at him as Hoover demanded he start the engine of the plane that he was investigating. With the engine started Hoover made the deal that since the aircraft only had room for one occupant that the other two POW's would keep the gun to aid in their escape. He did not even taxi towards the runway he simply hit the throttle heading straight out across a field to take off. Hoover did not have a parachute and was in an enemy aircraft flying towards Allied lines knowing he would be an easy target for an American or British fighter pilot. He did not even have a way to tell once he had safely reached Allied territory he simply knew to look for the windmills of Holland and land when he saw them. After flying all the way across The Netherlands to Zuider Zee he finally spotted windmills and landed in a field,Hoover 1997, pp. 88‚Äì90. at which point he was surrounded by angry Dutch farmers armed with pitchforks who were under the impression they had just captured a German. Eventually a British supply truck came by at which point Hoover was able to explain who he was. After the war, he was assigned to flight-test duty at Wilbur Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio. There he impressed and befriended Chuck Yeager.Hoover 1997, p. 93. When Yeager was later asked whom he wanted for flight crew for the supersonic Bell X-1 flight, the first flight to break the sound barrier, he named Hoover. Hoover became Yeager's backup pilot in the Bell X-1 program and flew chase for Yeager in a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star during the Mach 1 flight.Hoover 1997, p. 110. He also flew chase for the 50th anniversary of the Mach 1 flight in a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.\\"Hoover Flys Chase for Yeager.\\" Ohio University Post, October 15, 1997. Retrieved: November 29, 2008. Hoover left the air force for civilian jobs in 1948.Hoover 1997, p. 137. After a brief time with the Allison Engine Company, he worked as a test/demonstration pilot with North American Aviation, in which capacity he went to Korea to teach pilots flying combat missions in the Korean War how to dive-bomb with the North American F-86 Sabre. During his six weeks in Korea, Hoover flew many combat bombing missions over enemy territory, but was denied permission to engage in air-to-air combat flights.Hoover 1997, pp. 187‚Äì189. During the 1950s, Hoover visited many active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard units to demonstrate the capabilities of various aircraft to their pilots. Hoover flew flight tests on the North American FJ-2 Fury, F-86 Sabre, and the North American F-100 Super Sabre. In the early 1960s, Hoover began flying a North American P-51 Mustang at air shows around the country. The Hoover Mustang (registration N2251D) was purchased by North American Aviation from Dave Lindsay's Cavalier Aircraft Corp. in 1962. A second Mustang (N51RH), later named \\"Ole Yeller\\", was purchased by North American Rockwell from Cavalier in 1971 to replace the earlier aircraft, which had been destroyed in a ground accident when an oxygen bottle exploded after being overfilled. Hoover demonstrated the Mustang and later an Aero Commander at hundreds of air shows until his retirement in the 1990s.

Hoover at the final launch of SpaceShipOne in 2004 Hoover was best known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to demonstrate the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engine business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the aircraft as he put it through rolls, loops and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he would shut down both engines and execute a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would restart the engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps, such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place, Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast all the way back to his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.  End of career  Hoover's 2005 Gathering of Eagles Lithograph Hoover's Shrike Commander at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center His air show aerobatics career ended in 1999, but was marked by issues with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) over his medical certification that began when Hoover's medical certificate was revoked by the FAA in the early 1990s.Hoover 1997, pp. 278‚Äì279.Jordan, Jon L., MD, JD. \\"The Federal Air Surgeon's Column: Bob Hoover, the facts.\\" Federal Aviation Administration. Retrieved: July 19, 2015. Shortly before his revocation, Hoover experienced serious engine problems in a North American T-28 Trojan off the coast of California. During his return to Torrance, California, he was able to keep the engine running intermittently by constantly manipulating the throttle-, mixture- and propeller controls. The engine seized at the moment of touchdown. Hoover believed his successful management of this difficult emergency should have convinced the FAA that he hadn't lost any ability.Hoover 1997, p. 280. Meanwhile, Hoover was granted a pilot license and medical certificate by Australia's aviation authority.Hoover 1997, pp. 281‚Äì282. Hoover's United States medical certificate was restored shortly afterward and he returned to the American air show circuit for several years before retiring in 1999. At 77 years old Hoover still felt capable of performing and passed a rigorous FAA physical post-retirement, but he was unable to obtain insurance for air shows. Although he had had free insurance for several years as part of air show sponsorship deals, he was forced in 1999 to pay for it out of his own pocket and could not get coverage under $2 million. His final air show was on November 13, 1999 at Luke Air Force Base. His last flight in his famous Shrike Commander was on October 10, 2003 from Lakeland, Florida, to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. with long-time friend Steve Clegg. Following Hoover's retirement, his Shrike Commander was placed on display at the Steven F.

Hoover Nozzle and Hoover Ring  The \\"Hoover Nozzle\\", used on refueling equipment dispensing jet fuel, is designed with a flattened bell shape. It cannot be inserted in the filler neck of a gasoline-powered aircraft with the \\"Hoover Ring\\" installed, thus preventing the tank from accidentally being filled with jet fuel. This system was given this name following an accident in which Hoover was seriously injured, when both engines on his Shrike Commander failed during takeoff. Investigators found that the aircraft had just been fueled by line personnel who mistook the piston-engine Shrike for a similar turboprop model, filling the tanks with jet fuel instead of avgas (aviation gasoline).Hoover 1997, pp. 275‚Äì277.

Population: History It is not clear when Kargopol was founded, but, when first chronicled in 1146, it was a trade station of the Novgorod Republic and one of the most northerly permanent Slavic settlements. Although documentation for its early history is scarce, it is believed that Kargopol was the most significant trade center of Bjarmaland throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. In 1447, it was the place where Dmitry Shemyaka found refuge from Vasily II's ire. Situated on the ancient route between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (then the only Russian seaport), Kargopol became one of the most prosperous cities of Russia, especially after the Muscovy Company started to operate in the mid-16th century. During the Time of Troubles it withstood a siege by Polish and Lithuanian brigands. The peasant rebel Ivan Bolotnikov was executed in Kargopol in 1608. After Russia regained access to the Baltic Sea and St. Petersburg was founded, Kargopol gradually faded to obscurity. However, the people of Kargopol were still active in the exploration of Asian Russia. Alexander Baranov, the first governor of Russian America (Alaska), was born in this town. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kargopol serves as the administrative center of Kargopolsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kargopolsky District as the town of district significance of Kargopol. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Kargopol, together with the village of Zazhigino in Pavlovsky Selsoviet of Kargopolsky District, are incorporated within Kargopolsky Municipal District as Kargopolskoye Urban Settlement.Law #258-vneoch.-OZ Economy =Industry= Timber industry serves as the basis of the industry of Kargopolsky District. The linum production factory, which used to exist in Kargopol until the 1970s, is defunct. =Transportation= Kargopol is connected by a paved road with Nyandoma and further east the principal highway in the region, M8 connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. There is a road to the north, which connects to M8 via Plesetsk and Brin-Navolok. This is the historic trading route which connected Kargopol with Arkhangelsk before the railroad was built and long stretches of this road are still unpaved. The stretch between Kargopol and Plesetsk was paved in 2011. Another unpaved road in the western direction crosses the border with the Republic of Karelia and heads to Pudozh. There is no railroad in Kargopol, even though at the time of construction of the railway between Vologda and Arkhangelsk‚Äîa decision taken by Tsar Alexander III in June 1894‚Äîit was the biggest town in the region, and the railway was constructed through unpopulated areas. There is an urban legend stating that Kargopol merchants were unhappy with the prospective of the railway construction in Kargopol, thinking it would deteriorate the trade, and therefore requested the railway to be built in detour. As a matter of fact, the local governance body, the Kargopol Duma, in September 1894 twice discussed the issue, came to the conclusion that the railroad construction indeed would deteriorate the trade, but that if it does not pass Kargopol, the damage would be much stronger. Therefore, on both occasions, the Duma sent a petition requesting that the railway would be rerouted via Kargopol. This did not occur since the construction had already started in August 1894, and since the detour would have been too big, as Kargopol is not on a straight line connecting Vologda with Arkhangelsk. The Onega is only navigable between Kargopol and Lake Lacha, since there are rapids downstream of Kargopol. There is an airport in Kargopol, but since at least the early 1990s it has only been used for transporting cargo. Climate Culture and recreation Today, Kargopol is a sleepy historical town adjoining the Kenozersky National Park. It is best known in Russia for Kargopol toys (Kargopolskiye igrushki), which are small, simple clay figures painted in traditional style. During its golden age in the 17th century, Kargopol became home to a highly localized brand of medieval Russian architecture. Quite a few wooden and white stone churches survive in the town and its vicinity. The earliest of these buildings is the black-domed Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ, built of dolomite by Novgorodians and consecrated in 1562. The interior features a curious iron hand sticking from the drum. A hallmark of Kargopol churches is delicate stone carving. The 17th- century churches of Kargopol are decorated with unique stone carving The Kargopol stone churches are classified as historical and architectural heritage and include: *Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ (1552‚Äì1562) with the bell-tower (1766‚Äì1767) *Resurrection Church (end of the 17th century) *Church of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist (1740‚Äì1751) *Holy Trinity Church (1790‚Äì1802) *Presentation Church (1803) *an ensemble of three churches: the Annunciation Church (1692), the Saint Nicholas Church (1741), and the Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos (1678‚Äì1680) The Annunciation Church (left) and the St. Nicholas Church (right) Kargopol is classified as a historical town by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in the historical center. The only state museum in the town is the Kargopol State Museum of History, Art, and Architecture, founded in 1919. This is a cloak organization, which not only holds ethnographic, art, and historic exhibits, but also protects some of the architectural monuments in Kargopol and surroundings. Fifteen buildings, including a number of churches, are museum property. There are also two private museums in Kargopol. Kargopol \\"Bigfoot\\" Kargopol is also known throughout the Russian northwest for its numerous alleged sasquatch (bigfoot) sightings. The best known legend is reported to have happened in the early 1990s and was documented by authors.http://www.bigfootencounters.com/creatures/russian.htm Maya Bykova and Vadim Makarov (in his book Atlas of the SnowmanAtlas of the Snowman) According to the legend, about from Kargopol, two hairy creatures, one a large \\"mother\\", the other its \\"child\\", made their way towards a military barracks. A young soldier on guard duty noticed the creatures and hurried back to the barracks for help. The sasquatch, carrying its young, entered behind the soldier. Although making non-threatening gestures and sounds, the creature was attacked by a soldier (who promptly passed out due to the overwhelming stench coming from the creature). Frightened, the creature ran away into the forest. As many as a dozen soldiers are reported to have witnessed these strange creatures on this night.

The southern part of the Kenozersky National Park also drains into Lake Lacha. The stretch between Kargopol and the lake is navigable, however, neither the Svid upstream from the lake nor the Onega downstream are navigable because of the rapids.

However, his father insisted on him taking swimming lessons in that sports school, and in his own words, he has \\"been stuck there ever since\\". Popov started out as a backstroker but switched to freestyle when he joined Gennadi Touretski's squad in 1990 on the initiative by the head coach of the USSR National Team Gleb Petrov. He later moved from Russia to Australia to be with his coach. Popov won the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, and repeated his victories in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, becoming the first man to do so since Johnny Weissmuller. He presented Touretski with his 1996 Olympic gold medal from the 100 m freestyle. \\"I have a title and I'm on the paper, but, you know, Gennadi hasn't gotten anything from Atlanta or from Barcelona,\\" Popov said. \\"But I know how much this particular medal means for him, is worth for him.\\" One month after the Atlanta Olympics, he was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife during a dispute with three Moscow street vendors. The knife sliced his artery, grazed one of his kidneys and damaged the pleura, the membrane that encases the lungs. He had emergency surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. At the 1997 European Championships in Seville, Spain, he successfully defended his 50 m and 100 m freestyle titles. In 2000, he beat the world record in the 50-metre freestyle in a time of 21.64 at Russia's Olympic Trials in Moscow. Popov, considered one of the most technically sound swimmers of all time, took just 31 strokes to set the world mark, which would last nearly eight years. In the 2003 Barcelona World Championships, Popov once again made a clean sweep of the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle events, citing that Barcelona would always be special to him, for it was there that for him, everything first began. He announced his participation in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Moreover, he was the Flagbearer of Russia in the opening ceremony. However, being the oldest competitor at the pool, the gold medal eluded him, and he did not even manage to make it into the finals of both the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle events. He announced his retirement from the sport in January 2005. Post swimming Popov at the Kremlin in 2008 Popov was elected a full member of the International Olympic Committee in December 1999. He also represents the athletes on the IOC Sport for All Commission and was elected directly as one of seven athletes to the IOC Athletes' Commission by the athletes participating in the 1996 Olympics. He was re-elected to the Athletes Commission at the 2000 Games and is now Honorary Secretary. He was awarded the 1996 Russian Medal of Honour for contributions to sport. He was also named Russian Athlete of the Year and European Sports Press Union Athlete of the Year in 1996. In June 2003, he confirmed that he was permanently leaving Australia in early 2004 to live in Solothurn, Switzerland. He said the move followed the offer of a business proposition in Switzerland, once he had retired from swimming. He retained Touretski as a long-distance coach.

He was recruited by the Shelikov Company for trading in Russian America, beginning in 1790 with a five-year contract as manager of the outpost. He continued to serve past the end date of his contract. In 1799 Baranov was promoted, appointed by the recently chartered Russian-American Company as Chief Manager, effectively the first governor of Russian America. He served until 1818. This was the early colonial period of expansion of settlements. He founded Pavlovskaya (Kodiak) and later New Archangel (Sitka), Russian colonies that were bases of the company in present-day Alaska. In addition, he oversaw the expansion of the lucrative fur trade with Alaska Natives. He continued to support his Russian wife and children, who had moved from Siberia back to live near St. Petersburg. In Pavlovskaya, Baranov took an Aleut woman as mistress and had three mixed-race children with her. After learning that his wife had died in 1807 in Russia, he married his mistress, legitimizing their children. In 1817 Irina, his oldest daughter born in Alaska, married Semyon Yanovsky, a Russian naval officer. Late in 1818, Yanovsky was appointed as Chief Manager and successor to Baranov. That year Baranov departed to sail back to Russia, but he died in April 1819 and was buried at sea. Early life and work Alexander Andreyevich Baranov was born in 1747 in Kargopol, in St. Petersburg Governorate of the Russian Empire. He was the son of Andrey Baranov, a lower-class merchant or mestchanin, in the Russian stratified order of classes. Baranov ran away from home at the age of fifteen and went to Moscow, where he became a clerk before returning home. After he married and his first child (a daughter) was born, Baranov took his young family to Siberia for its frontier opportunities. In Irkutsk, he became a trader and tax collector with his brother. Eventually, his wife left Baranov and returned to Kargopol with their daughter and two young children they had adopted. There was no divorce in the Russian Orthodox Church. Baranov supported them all from afar. Establishment of Russian America Due to business reverses that had left Baranov nearly bankrupt, he was lured to Russian America by opportunities offered by Grigory Ivanovich Shelikhov, a merchant and developer who had established a settlement on Kodiak Island to enhance the growing Russian maritime fur trade there. Baranov accepted a five- year contract starting in the fall of 1790 to be the chief manager of the Shelikhov Company, and to establish and manage additional trading posts in the Kodiak Island region.Brown, S.R., 2009, Merchant Kings, New York: St. Martin's Press, En route in 1790 from Okhotsk, Siberia to Kodiak Island of Russian America, Baranov suffered the wreck of his ship in October on Unalaska Island, an Aleutian Island close to the Alaska Peninsula. It was about 600 miles from Kodiak. With critical help from the local indigenous Aleut people, Baranov and his shipmates survived the winter. They continued their journey via Native sea-going boats in the spring of 1791 and reached Kodiak Island. In 1792, Baranov moved the Russian settlement from Three Saints Bay, which had too constrained an area to succeed, to what they called Pavlovskaya (later renamed as Kodiak). In 1793, he founded the port of Voskresensk in Chugach Bay. In 1794, under the direction of a British sea captain working for the Russian American Company, a sea-going sailing ship was built at Resurrection Bay. This was important for the colonies in fulfilling their transportation needs. Shortly after, a group of Russian Orthodox clergy arrived in Russian America. Their views were often at odds with Baranov's methods of management, especially of the native workers. He founded a settlement in Yakutat Bay in 1795 for 30 serf farming families from Russia. By 1797, Baranov was two years overdue to be replaced, and he had no word of relief. That year, Baranov's Aleut mistress gave birth to their son, Antipatr. He had two more mixed-race Aleut-Russian children with his mistress, also giving them Russian names: Irina and Ekaterina. After learning that his wife in Russia had died, Baranov married the Aleut woman, legitimizing their children.Borneman, Walter R. Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land. New York City: HarperCollins. 2003, pp. 73-76. In Saint Petersburg, then capital of Russia, Nikolai Rezanov was a high official, Chamberlain to the Tsar. He was also Chairman of the Russian American Company, successor of the Shelikhof Company, through which Russia occupied and ruled Alaska. Due to Rezanov's influence at the royal court, in 1799 Baranov was appointed as Chief Manager ‚Äì to manage all of the Russian American Company's interests in the field, including the Aleutian and Kuril Islands. However, due to the one-year travel time each way between St. Petersburg and Alaska, it was late 1800 before Baranov learned of his promotion and expanded responsibilities. Communication with the government in St. Petersburg was so difficult that Baranov was left almost entirely on his own to decide any pressing issues. For all practical matters, he was the government of Alaska. In 1799, Baranov had decided that perceived British encroachment on Russia's holdings in southeastern Alaska required him to build a defensive fort in that area. While the Russians maintained that he bought a portion of land from the Tlingit and built a fort and settlement on Sitka Island overlooking Sitka Sound, the Tlingit believed that land could not be owned, therefore meaning that the land occupied by the Russians was never purchased. He believed it was important in order to ensure that the region remained under Russian instead of British control. In 1802, after Baranov had returned to Kodiak to tend to matters there, the Tlingit tribe on Sitka Island decided to expel the Russians. The latter disregarded the Tlingit warnings to evacuate. Led by war chief Katlian (spelled Kot-le-an in Michener's Alaska), the Tlingit attacked and massacred nearly everyone at the Sitka settlement. Baranov responded by gathering naval forces and an army of about 700 Aleut warriors to attack Katlian's formidable new fort on Sitka at Indian River. He intended to push the Tlingit off Sitka Island temporarily in order to build an impregnable Russian fort at the most strategic site on Sitka Sound. This would be at a place that had been long occupied by the Tlingit, who also knew its strategic value. To Baranov's great surprise and satisfaction, as he prepared for battle, a decree arrived from Tsar Alexander I promoting him to the rank of Collegiate Counselor‚Äîa rank in the middle of the Russian ranks of nobility. From the lowly class of mestchannin, far below nobility, he had been elevated to a rank equal or superior to the Imperial Russian Navy ship captains, who had treated him with condescension because of his low social rank. In September 1804, Baranov sailed into Sitka Sound with his forces, including a powerful Russian Navy frigate, Neva. Baranov met with Katlian and other Native chiefs and tried to negotiate a peaceful resolution, without success. Just before the Battle of Sitka began, most of the Tlingit gunpowder (acquired from the British and Americans) exploded. It was hit by Russian gunfire while being moved by Tlingit warriors in a war canoe to their main fort from storage on a small island. This loss greatly weakened the Tlingit defenses. The Russian ground forces unsuccessfully launched a frontal attack on the Tlingit fort at Indian River. Thereafter, they concentrated on naval bombardment from the big guns of the frigate Neva. After several days, the Tlingit abandoned their fort and escaped in a \\"survival march\\" to the adjoining Chichagof Island to the north. Baranov immediately began construction of a new fort on top of a rock outcropping at the eastern edge of Sitka Sound. Food soon became scarce for the Russians. Baranov sent a 50-foot sailboat, under the command of his deputy Ivan Kuskov, the 2800 miles to Hawaii to get urgently needed food supplies from King Kamehameha, a long-time trading friend. Kuskov returned with the supplies in time to narrowly avert starvation of the Russians at Sitka. In 1805, Tlingit warriors attacked and massacred the Russian settlement at Yakutat, which Baranov decided to abandon. Late that year, Nikolai Rezanov, the Tsar's Chamberlain and Chairman of the Russian American Company, arrived in Russian America for an inspection trip. He had heard rumors that Baranov was mismanaging affairs. But Rezanov's resulting reports to the Tsar praised Baranov's management and attributed rumors against the governor to malcontents. Baranov asked to be relieved of his position so that he could return to Russia and see his family there again. Believing Baranov to be indispensable to the RAC colonies, Rezanov avoided a definite answer. In the spring of 1806, Rezanov sailed from Sitka to San Francisco in Spanish-held California to obtain urgently needed food supplies in exchange for otter furs. He also tried to establish an alliance with the Spanish against the United Kingdom and United States. During this visit with the Spanish of Northern California, he became enamored of Maria Concepcion \\"Conchita\\" Arguello, the famously beautiful daughter of the commander of the Spanish garrison at San Francisco. They became engaged to be married, subject to religious approvals, as she was Roman Catholic and he was Russian Orthodox. Rezanov thought this potential match would be a boon to Russian/Spanish cooperation in North America. He returned to Sitka with the needed food. From there, he sailed to Siberia to begin the thousands of miles of overland travel to St. Petersburg to seek the necessary religious approvals from Russian Orthodox clergy for his marriage. During the harsh winter trek on horseback across Siberia, Rezanov became ill and died. His great dream of a joint Russian-Spanish empire of the Pacific ended there. In 1807 Baranov was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 2nd class for his successful perseverance and leadership. That year he received news that his Russian wife had died. Baranov married his Native mistress in the Russian Orthodox church and had their three children legitimized. Despite his success in reestablishing a solid presence at present-day Sitka, to which Baranov had moved the capital of Russian America from Kodiak, there was local opposition to his rule. He wore a shirt of iron mail beneath his outer shirt to protect himself. The Tlingit made several unsuccessful attempts at assassination, and were amazed by his survival, not knowing of his armor. In 1810, Baranov was at risk of assassination by some of his own disgruntled Russian soldiers, but he was warned and the attempt was thwarted. Meanwhile, he learned that men who had been appointed by the RAC to relieve Baranov died en route to Alaska, to his great disappointment. Activity in the region flourished as trading in sea otters and seals boomed. Baranov convinced Native hunters to expand their range to include the coasts of California.Khlebnikov, K.T., 1973, Baranov, Chief Manager of the Russian Colonies in America, Kingston: The Limestone Press, Baranov also advocated more educational opportunities for the Alaska Native Americans. Under his leadership, schools were created and frontier communities became less isolated. During Baranov's rule, Russian Orthodox missionaries operated widely in Russian America. They translated the Bible into Tlingit and other Native languages, conducted mass in those languages, and inoculated Natives against smallpox. In 1812, Baranov established Fort Ross in California about 50 miles north of San Francisco. It was intended to develop farm products to feed the Alaskan communities. In 1815, Baranov sent Dr. Georg Schaffer, a physician, to Hawaii to establish a way station to accommodate Russian ships carrying furs from Alaska to the booming fur markets of Canton, China. Schaffer got involved with Hawaiian politics to the displeasure of King Kamahameha; he was forced to depart for China and leave the Russian forts on Kauai abandoned. The Hawaiian project was Baranov's greatest failure, causing considerable expense to the Russian American Company. As a result of this failure, concern about Baranov's age (70), and allegations against him by navy officers returning from Alaska, the Russian American Company Board of Directors decided to commission Russian Navy Capt. Lt. Ludwig von Hagemeister (also known as Leontij in Russian) to go to Alaska, investigate the charges against Baranov, and replace him as Chief Manager and governor. He did not reach Alaska until 1817, and replaced Baranov in early 1818. Hagemeister and Baranov left Russian America together in the fall to return to St. Petersburg. Hagemeister appointed Semyon Yanovsky, as Chief Manager. He was replaced in 1820 with an officer chosen directly by the Board of the RAC. Retirement and death Hagemeister arrived at Sitka in November 1817 with an accountant, Kirill Khlebnikov (later Baranov's first biographer), to audit the financial records of Russian America for any evidence of Baranov's alleged wrongdoing. Hagemeister succeeded Baranov as Chief Manager and governor in January 1818. Khlebnikov was appointed Office Manager, receiving company capital totaling two and a half million rubles. Khlebnikov's audit showed that the books balanced to the ruble, with all income and disbursements accounted for. There was no evidence of malfeasance by Baranov. The audit showed that Baranov was personally almost insolvent because he had made it a practice to help others in financial distress with his own funds throughout his rule. In late July 1818, a Russian Imperial Navy ship sailing around the world arrived in Sitka for a brief visit of less than a month. On board was Mikhail Tikhanov, a Navy artist assigned to document the voyage. In August 1818, Tikhanov painted an oil portrait of Baranov and a watercolor of Tlingit chief Katlian and his wife. These were the only likenesses ever made during their lifetimes of the two long-time antagonists who had finally made peace. Baranov's portrait is shown above. It was painted when he was 71, six months before he died. In the Katlian painting (which can be seen on the Internet), the chief is about age 45. He is shown with an \\"Allies of Russia\\" silver medal hanging on a light chain from his neck, and with Baranov's \\"Castle\\" fortress in the distance behind the chief. The two paintings together, by the same artist at the same time, offer a remarkable narrative on war and peace. In October 1818, Hagemeister appointed his second- in-command Navy Lt. Semyon Yanovsky, by then husband of Irina Baranov and thus Baranov's son-in-law, to act as Chief Manager and governor. On 27 November, Baranov and Hagemeister left Alaska together on the Navy ship Kutuzov for Russia. The ship headed south on a route that would take it west around the Cape of Good Hope at the foot of the African continent, to sail northward to St. Petersburg. En route, the ship made an extended stopover in March 1819 in the Dutch settlement of Batavia, on the island of Java, then part of the colonial Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia). Baranov became ill there, and soon after the ship resumed its journey, he died on 16 April 1819. He was buried at sea in the Sunda Strait off Panaitan, never reaching his homeland or his family.

For instance, some reserve the term color wheel for mechanical rotating devices, such as color tops, filter wheels or Newton disc. Others classify various color wheels as color disc, color chart, and color scale varieties. As an illustrative model, artists typically use red, yellow, and blue primaries (RYB color model) arranged at three equally spaced points around their color wheel. Printers and others who use modern subtractive color methods and terminology use magenta, yellow, and cyan as subtractive primaries. Intermediate and interior points of color wheels and circles represent color mixtures. In a paint or subtractive color wheel, the \\"center of gravity\\" is usually (but not always) black, representing all colors of light being absorbed; in a color circle, on the other hand, the center is white or gray, indicating a mixture of different wavelengths of light (all wavelengths, or two complementary colors, for example). The original color circle of Isaac Newton showed only the spectral hues and was provided to illustrate a rule for the color of mixtures of lights, that these could be approximately predicted from the center of gravity of the numbers of \\"rays\\" of each spectral color present (represented in his diagram by small circles). The divisions of Newton's circle are of unequal size, being based on the intervals of a Dorian musical scale. Most later color circles include the purples, however, between red and violet, and have equal-sized hue divisions. Color scientists and psychologists often use the additive primaries, red, green and blue; and often refer to their arrangement around a circle as a color circle as opposed to a color wheel.  Colors of the color wheel  A 1908 color wheel with red, green, and violet \\"plus colors\\" and magenta, yellow, and cyan blue \\"minus colors\\" The typical artists' paint or pigment color wheel includes the blue, red, and yellow primary colors. The corresponding secondary colors are green, orange, and violet or purple. The tertiary colors are green-yellow, yellow-orange, orange-red, red-violet/purple, purple/violet-blue and blue- green. A color wheel based on RGB (red, green, blue) or RGV (red, green, violet) additive primaries has cyan, magenta, and yellow secondaries (cyan was previously known as cyan blue). Alternatively, the same arrangement of colors around a circle can be described as based on cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractive primaries, with red, green, and blue (or violet) being secondaries. Most color wheels are based on three primary colors, three secondary colors, and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary, known as tertiary colors, for a total of 12 main divisions; some add more intermediates, for 24 named colors. Other color wheels, however, are based on the four opponent colors, and may have four or eight main colors. Goethe's Theory of Colours provided the first systematic study of the physiological effects of color (1810). His observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel anticipating Ewald Hering's opponent color theory (1872). The color circle and color vision A 1917 four-way color circle related to the color opponent process A color circle based on spectral wavelengths appears with red at one end of the spectrum and is 100% mixable violet at the other. A wedge-shaped gap represents colors that have no unique spectral frequency. These extra- spectral colors, the purples, form from additive mixture of colors from the ends of the spectrum. In normal human vision, wavelengths of between about 400 nm and 700 nm are represented by this incomplete circle, with the longer wavelengths equating to the red end of the spectrum. Complement colors are located directly opposite each other on this wheel. These complement colors are not identical to colors in pigment mixing (such as are used in paint), but when lights are additively mixed in the correct proportions appear as a neutral grey or white.Krech, D., Crutchfield, R.S., Livson, N., Wilson, W.A. jr., Parducci, A. (1982) Elements of psychology (4th ed.). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 108‚Äì109. The color circle is used for, among other purposes, illustrating additive color mixture. Combining two colored lights from different parts of the spectrum may produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum, even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved. This type of color matching is known as metameric matching. Thus a combination of green and red light might produce a color close to yellow in apparent hue. The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle, but they are usually represented as being joined by a straight line on the circle, the location of the new color closer to the (white) centre of the circle indicating that the resulting hue is less saturated (i.e., paler) than either of the two source colors. The combination of any two colors in this way are always less saturated than the two pure spectral colors individually. Objects may be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions. The human visual system is able to adapt to these differences by chromatic adaptation. This aspect of the visual system is relatively easy to mislead, and optical illusions relating to color are therefore a common phenomenon. The color circle is a useful tool for examining these illusions. Arranging spectral colors in a circle to predict admixture of light stems from work by Sir Isaac Newton. Newton's calculation of the resulting color involves three steps: First, mark on the color circle the constituent colors according to their relative weight. Second, find the barycenter of these differently weighted colors. Third, interpret the radial distance (from the center of the circle to the barycenter) as the saturation of the color, and the azimuthal position on the circle as the hue of the color. Thus, Newton's color circle is a predecessor of the modern, horseshoe- shaped CIE color diagram. The psychophysical theory behind the color circle dates to the early color triangle of Thomas Young, whose work was later extended by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. Young postulated that the eye contains receptors that respond to three different primary sensations, or spectra of light. As Maxwell showed, all hues, but not all colors, can be created from three primary colors such as red, green, and blue, if they are mixed in the right proportions. Color wheels and paint color mixing There is no straight-line relationship between colors mixed in pigment, which vary from medium to medium. With a psychophysical color circle, however, the resulting hue of any mixture of two colored light sources can be determined simply by the relative brightness and wavelength of the two lights.Schiffman, H.R. (1990) Sensation and perception: An integrated approach (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley & Sons, pp. 252‚Äì253. A similar calculation cannot be performed with two paints. As such, a painter's color wheel is indicative rather than predictive, being used to compare existing colors rather than calculate exact colors of mixtures. Because of differences relating to the medium, different color wheels can be created according to the type of paint or other medium used, and many artists make their own individual color wheels. These often contain only blocks of color rather than the gradation between tones that is characteristic of the color circle.Rodwell, J. (1987) The complete watercolour artist. London: Paul Press, pp. 94‚Äì95. Color wheel software A number of interactive color wheel applications are available both on the Internet and as desktop applications. These programs are used by artists and designers for picking colors for a design.  HSV color wheel  HSV, labeled with HTML color keywords The HSL and HSV color spaces are simple geometric transformations of the RGB cube into cylindrical form. The outer top circle of the HSV cylinder ‚Äì or the outer middle circle of the HSL cylinder ‚Äì can be thought of as a color wheel. There is no authoritative way of labeling the colors in such a color wheel, but the six colors which fall at corners of the RGB cube are given names in the X11 color list, and are named keywords in HTML. Color schemes Color schemes are logical combinations of colors on the color wheel. Moses Harris, in his book The Natural System of Colours (1776), presented this color palette. Complementary colors are two colors directly across from each other; for example, red and green are complementary colors. Tetradic color palettes use four colors, a pair of complementary color pairs. For example, one could use yellow, purple, red, and green. Tetrad colors can be found by putting a square or rectangle on the color wheel. In color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media. For example, the use of a white background with black text is an example of a common default color scheme in web design. Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling together commonly appear together in color schemes. A basic color scheme uses two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination, usually based around a single color‚Äîfor example, text with such colors as red, yellow, orange and light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article. Ignaz Schifferm√ºller, Versuch eines Farbensystems (Vienna, 1772), plate I. Color wheels can be used to create pleasing color schemes. An analogous color scheme is made up of colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, red, orange, and yellow are analogous colors. Color schemes can also contain different shades of a single color; for example, a color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light (almost white) to very dark. Analogous colors are colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, yellow and green. Monochromic colors are different shades of the same color. For example, light blue, indigo, and cyan blue. Complementary colors are colors across from each other on a color wheel. For example, blue and orange. Triadic colors are colors that are evenly across from each other, in a triangle over the color wheel. For example, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue are triadic colors.How to create color palettes For a list of ways to construct color schemes, regarding properties such as warmness/achromiticness/complementariness, see color theory.

Cringely is the pen name of both technology journalist Mark Stephens and a string of writers for a column in InfoWorld, the one-time weekly computer trade newspaper published by IDG.  InfoWorld  Mark Stephens was the third author to contribute to Infoworld under the Cringely pseudonym, the first two being Rory J. O'Connor and then Laurie Flynn. The original column, the first computer \\"gossip\\" column, was started by Mark Garetz and called According to Garetz; it was later taken over by John Dvorak. During Stephens' lengthy tenure (1987‚Äì1995), the character of Cringely changed dramatically (morphing from a private eye type to a slick, womanizing tech insider) and became an increasingly popular tech pundit after he published the book Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition and Still Can't Get a Date (1992, ). After a financial disagreement in 1995, Stephens was dismissed from Infoworld and was promptly sued by IDG to prevent him from continuing to use the Cringely trademark. A settlement was reached out of court that allowed him to use the name, so long as he did not contribute to competing technology magazines. InfoWorld.com continued to publish the \\"Robert X.

It contains about 1,100 islands, which are the tops of the submerged coastal mountains that rise steeply from the Pacific Ocean. Deep channels and fjords separate the islands and cut them off from the mainland. The northern part of the Inside Passage is sheltered by the islands as it winds its way among them. The islands have irregular, steep coasts and dense evergreen and temperate rain forests, and most are accessible only by boat or aeroplane. The vast majority of the islands are part of the Tongass National Forest. In order of land area, the largest islands are Prince of Wales Island, Chichagof Island, Admiralty Island, Baranof Island, Revillagigedo Island, Kupreanof Island, Kuiu Island, Etolin Island, Dall Island, Wrangell Island, Mitkof Island, Zarembo Island, Kosciusko Island, Kruzof Island, Annette Island, Gravina Island, and Yakobi Island. All the islands are rugged, densely forested, and have an abundance of wildlife. The Tlingit and Kaigani Haida people are native to the area. The Tsimshian people found on Annette Island are not originally from the area, having immigrated to the region from British Columbia in the late 19th century. Ketchikan on Revillagigedo Island and Sitka on Baranof Island are the largest towns on the islands. The most populous neighborhoods of the largest town in the region, Juneau, are on the mainland, though portions of the city also lie on Douglas Island, which is a part of the archipelago. Tourism, fishing, and logging are the main industries of the islands. History The first European to visit the archipelago was the Russian navigator Aleksei Chirikov in 1741, who sighted the coasts of Noyes and Baker Islands (both off the west coast of Prince of Wales Island), as well as Baranof, Chichagof, Kruzof and Yakobi Islands. In 1774 Juan Jos√© P√©rez Hern√°ndez sighted the south coast of Dall Island, while Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra entered Bucareli Bay off Prince of Wales Island the following year. In 1792 Jacinto Caama√±o sighted Revillagigedo Island and the Gravina Islands, discovering Clarence Strait. George Vancouver and his men made an extensive survey of the archipelago in 1793 and 1794, circumnavigating both Revillagigedo and Admiralty Islands, charting the entirety of Kuiu Island, the east sides of Baranof and Chichagof Islands, and Etolin, Wrangell, Zarembo, Mitkof, and Kupreanof Islands. Within a decade the Russians had traversed Peril Strait separating Chichagof and Baranof Islands, and in the following decades found the straits and passages separating several of the other major islands. An 1844 Russian chart shows Kupreanof separated from Mitkof Island and Etolin, Wrangell, Woronkofski, and Zarembo Islands separated from each other. The archipelago was a locus of the Maritime Fur Trade during the early 19th century. Control of the islands passed from Russia to the United States with the Alaska Purchase in 1867. According to Donald Orth's Dictionary of Alaska Place Names (p. 64), the Alexander Archipelago received its name from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1867. The island chain is named for Tsar Alexander II of Russia. On an 1860 map of Russian America (Alaska), the island group is called the King George III Archipelago.

It faces the chamber formed between the cornea and the iris. The corneal endothelium are specialized, flattened, mitochondria-rich cells that line the posterior surface of the cornea and face the anterior chamber of the eye. The corneal endothelium governs fluid and solute transport across the posterior surface of the cornea and maintains the cornea in the slightly dehydrated state that is required for optical transparency. Embryology and anatomy The corneal endothelium is embryologically derived from the neural crest. The postnatal total endothelial cellularity of the cornea (approximately 300,000 cells per cornea) is achieved as early as the second trimester of gestation. Thereafter the endothelial cell density (but not the absolute number of cells) rapidly declines, as the fetal cornea grows in surface area, achieving a final adult density of approximately 2400 - 3200 cells/mm¬≤. The number of endothelial cells in the fully developed cornea decreases with age up until early adulthood, stabilizing around 50 years of age. The normal corneal endothelium is a single layer of uniformly sized cells with a predominantly hexagonal shape. This honeycomb tiling scheme yields the greatest efficiency, in terms of total perimeter, of packing the posterior corneal surface with cells of a given area. The corneal endothelium is attached to the rest of the cornea through Descemet's membrane, which is an acellular layer composed mostly of collagen IV. Physiology Hexagonal cells of corneal endothelium visualized by specular microscopy. The principal physiological function of the corneal endothelium is to allow leakage of solutes and nutrients from the aqueous humor to the more superficial layers of the cornea while at the same time pumping water in the opposite direction, from the stroma to the aqueous. This dual function of the corneal endothelium is described by the \\"pump-leak hypothesis.\\" Since the cornea is avascular, which renders it optimally transparent, the nutrition of the corneal epithelium, stromal keratocytes, and corneal endothelium must occur via diffusion of glucose and other solutes from the aqueous humor, across the corneal endothelium. The corneal endothelium then transports water from the stromal-facing surface to the aqueous-facing surface by an interrelated series of active and passive ion exchangers. Critical to this energy-driven process is the role of Na+/K+ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Bicarbonate ions formed by the action of carbonic anhydrase are translocated across the cell membrane, allowing water to passively follow. Mechanisms of corneal edema Corneal endothelial cells are post-mitotic and divide rarely, if at all, in the post- natal human cornea. Wounding of the corneal endothelium, as from trauma or other insults, prompts healing of the endothelial monolayer by sliding and enlargement of adjacent endothelial cells, rather than mitosis. Endothelial cell loss, if sufficiently severe, can cause endothelial cell density to fall below the threshold level needed to maintain corneal deturgescence. This threshold endothelial cell density varies considerably amongst individuals, but is typically in the range of 500 - 1000 cells/mm¬≤. Typically, loss of endothelial cell density is accompanied by increases in cell size variability (polymegathism) and cell shape variation (polymorphism). Corneal edema can also occur as the result of compromised endothelial function due to intraocular inflammation or other causes. Excess hydration of the corneal stroma disrupts the normally uniform periodic spacing of Type I collagen fibrils, creating light scatter. In addition, excessive corneal hydration can result in edema of the corneal epithelial layer, which creates irregularity at the optically critical tear film-air interface. Both stromal light scatter and surface epithelial irregularity contribute to degraded optical performance of the cornea and can compromise visual acuity. Causes of endothelial disease Leading causes of endothelial failure include inadvertent endothelial trauma from intraocular surgery (such as cataract surgery) and Fuchs' dystrophy. Surgical causes of endothelial failure include both acute intraoperative trauma as well as chronic postoperative trauma, such as from a malpositioned intraocular lens or retained nuclear fragment in the anterior chamber. Other risk factors include narrow-angle glaucoma, aging, and iritis. A rare disease called X-linked endothelial corneal dystrophy was described in 2006. Treatment for endothelial disease There is no medical treatment that can promote wound healing or regeneration of the corneal endothelium. In early stages of corneal edema, symptoms of blurred vision and episodic ocular pain predominate, due to edema and blistering (bullae) of the corneal epithelium. Partial palliation of these symptoms can sometimes be obtained through the instillation of topical hypertonic saline drops, use of bandage soft contact lenses, and/or application of anterior stromal micropuncture. In cases in which irreversible corneal endothelial failure develops, severe corneal edema ensues, and the only effective remedy is replacement of the diseased corneal endothelium through the surgical approach of corneal transplantation. Historically, penetrating keratoplasty, or full thickness corneal transplantation, was the treatment of choice for irreversible endothelial failure. More recently, new corneal transplant techniques have been developed to enable more selective replacement of the diseased corneal endothelium. This approach, termed endokeratoplasty, is most appropriate for disease processes that exclusively or predominantly involve the corneal endothelium. Penetrating keratoplasty is preferred when the disease process involves irreversible damage not just to the corneal endothelium, but to other layers of the cornea as well. Compared to full-thickness keratoplasty, endokeratoplasty techniques are associated with shorter recovery times, improved visual results, and greater resistance to wound rupture. Although instrumentation and surgical techniques for endokeratoplasty are still in evolution, one commonly performed form of endokeratoplasty at present is Descemet's Stripping (Automated) Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK [or DSAEK]). In this form of endokeratoplasty, the diseased host endothelium and associated Descemet's membrane are removed from the central cornea, and in their place a specially harvested layer of healthy donor tissue is grafted. This layer consists of posterior stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium that has been dissected from cadaveric donor corneal tissue, typically using a mechanized (or \\"automated\\") instrument. Investigational methods of corneal endothelial surgical replacement include Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK), in which the donor tissue consists only of Descemet's membrane and endothelium, and corneal endothelial cell replacement therapy, in which in vitro cultivated endothelial cells are transplanted. These techniques, although still in an early developmental stage, aim to improve the selectivity of the transplantation approach by eliminating the presence of posterior stromal tissue from the grafted tissue.

First flown in 1959, the PC-6 was produced at Pilatus Flugzeugwerke in Stans, Switzerland. It has been built in both piston engine- and turboprop-powered versions and was produced under licence for a time by Fairchild Hiller in the United States. After around 600 deliveries in six decades, Pilatus produced the last one in early 2019. Development On 4 May 1959, the first prototype, powered by a 254 kW (340 shp) piston engine, made its maiden flight. In early May 1961, the first Turbo Porter, powered by a Turbomeca Astazou II turboprop engine, performed its initial flight.Fricker 1962, p. 38. In comparison to its earlier piston engine-powered incarnation, the Astazou II-equipped Turbo Porter had an increased gross capacity and top speed, as well as benefitting from the engine's automatic handling functions. These benefits came at the expense of a greater initial purchase cost and higher fuel consumption. Both the piston and turbine-engine versions of the PC-6 became quickly known for their Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capabilities, requiring only a very short takeoff run before being ready for rotation prior to taking off.Fricker 1962, p. 102. The initial turbine-powered models of the PC-6 were equipped with the Astazou II powerplant, however complaints of the reliability of this engine were made. Another early turboprop powerplant that became available for the PC-6 was the Garrett Air Research TPE 331. Some operators such as Air America chose to retrofit their Astazou II-powered PC-6s with the TPE 331 engine in its place.Leeker, Joe F. \\"Air America: Pilatus / Fairchild PC-6 Turbo Porters.\\" University of Texas at Dallas, 24 August 2015. In May 1996, the first PC-6 to be equipped with the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A engine performed its maiden flight.Moll 1993, p. 65. To offset rising labour and manufacturing costs in Switzerland, Pilatus distributed manufacturing work on the PC-6 to other countries; in 1993, Czech Republic-based Letov Kbely began manufacturing activity upon the type. In 2013, Pilatus formed a joint venture with Beijing Tian Xing Jian Yu Science Co., Ltd. to locally manufacture the PC-6 and the newer Pilatus PC-12 in Chongqing, China; initially this facility performed subassembly work on the fuselage, and later other elements such as the wings and moving surfaces, which were conveyed to Pilatus' final assembly facility in Stans, Switzerland.Spruce, Terry. \\"Pilatus forms joint venture and opens new facility in China.\\" Corporate Jet Investor, 7 August 2013.\\"Pilatus Bets On PC-6 Porter for China.\\" Aviation Week, 11 November 2014. Global production of the PC-6 shall be eventually transferred to the Chongqing facility.

In 2014, the majority of PC-6s delivered that year were to Chinese customers.Trautvetter, Chad. \\"Pilatus Tops $1B in Revenues for Second Year in a Row.\\" AIN Online, 9 April 2015. By April 2016, around 20 PC-6s were in operation in the Chinese market; the type has often been used to replace the Antonov An-2, being reportedly cheaper to operate.Thurber, Matt. \\"Pilatus PC-6 Proves Popular in China.\\" AIN Online, 13 April 2016. The Porter was also manufactured under license by Fairchild Hiller in the United States. Roughly 100 of these licence-produced aircraft would be completed, being mainly purchased by civil operators within the US. A number of Fairchild Hiller-built PC-6s were also procured for military operations during the Vietnam War. It received the designation AU-23A Peacemaker for service with the U.S. Air Force. The Peacemaker was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a centre fuselage station for external ordnance. However, the AU-23A proved to be troublesome in service. All of them were returned to the continental U.S. and placed into storage after only a single year of operation. In 1979, a pair of UV-20s were assigned to the aviation detachment of the Berlin Brigade in Germany due to their suitability for operating within the heavily restricted airspace; they were fitted for carrying either cargo, up to eleven passengers, or three litters with four medical attendants.Johnson and Jones 2013, pp. 433. After nearly 600 deliveries in six decades including about 90 Fairchild-Hiller built and 425 PT6-powered, but only 52 in the last ten years, Pilatus will close the orderbook from summer 2018 and will roll off the last one in early 2019 while parts production will continue for at least 20 years. Design PC-6 cabin interior, circa 1960s The Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) utility aircraft. The majority of aircraft are powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine, which drives a fully reversible, constant-speed, three-bladed HC-B3TN-3D (or an alternative four-bladed HC-D4N-3P unit) Hartzell aluminium propeller via a reduction gearbox.\\"Datalink.\\" Flying Magazine, November 2002. p. 50. Vol. 129, No. 11. ISSN 0015-4806. Pilatus claims that it possesses unique STOL capabilities, capable of landing in places only otherwise accessible by rotorcraft. It is fully capable of being operated from unprepared rough airstrips, in remote areas, hot climates and at high altitudes in all-weather conditions. In particular, the undercarriage employed provides for high wing and propeller clearances, making the PC-6 less susceptible to damage than conventional nosewheel-type undercarriages. For further landing versatility, various types of landing gear may be optionally installed allowing it to operate from different types of terrain; options include floats for water landings and skis for landing on snow.\\"PC-6: The World's Leading STOL.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 17 March 2016. Early models of the PC-6 were equipped with a full instrument panel as standard, and were reportedly easy for unfamiliar pilots to intuit. Later-manufactured PC-6s are equipped with a Garmin G950 glass cockpit in place of analog instrumentation; the majority of earlier-produced PC-6s can also be retrofitted with a glass cockpit.Collins, Peter. \\"FLIGHT TEST: Pilatus PC-6.\\" Flight International, 28 September 2010.\\"Cockpit.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 20 March 2016. In addition to its flight functionality, the G950 system acts as a remote maintenance unit and electronic flight bag all in one. Two large 10.4-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) are present, functioning as the Primary Flight Display for all key flight information and the Multi-function Display for system/mission management respectively; fully independent secondary flight instrumentation is also provided to provide backup altitude, attitude, and airspeed information in the event of complete electrical failure. The cockpit has been designed for single pilot operations; additional flight controls for a co-pilot can be optionally fitted. Other optional features include an autopilot (capable of operating within all phases of flight), traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, satellite phone, LIDAR, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and lightning detector; in addition, onboard electrical and avionics equipment are readily modifiable to conform with customer requirements. Analog cockpit instrumentation of a PC-6, 2007 The airframe is of a rugged and low-maintenance construction; featuring high levels of accessibility, interchangeability, and favourable manning levels.\\"PV-6 Turbo Porter: Anywhere, Anytime, in any Environment.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 19 March 2016. The wings, fuselage, and empennage are manufactured using conventional semi-monocoque construction techniques, the primary structure being composed of aluminium; the central structure retains critical strength despite the cutout areas for the sliding doors of the main cabin.Fricker 1962, p. 101. Corrosion resistance is achieved via a combination of plating and a polyurethane-based enamel paint. The simple nature of the structure allows for ease of repair in the field. Features such as low- pressure tyres, twin-caliper disc brakes, and a highly energy-absorbent undercarriage enable the aircraft to be capable of operating from rough or otherwise challenging terrain.\\"Operational Area.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 20 March 2016. For role flexibility, individual aircraft can be easily converted between various mission types, such as transport, paradrop, aerial photography, surveillance, air medical services and search and rescue duties. A maximum of ten passengers, or a 2,200 lb payload, may be carried within the aircraft's main cabin area within the rear section of the fuselage; the standard passenger seats are designed to allow for rapid removal and may be stowed within an optional separate externally-accessed seat stowage compartment behind the main cabin.\\"Cabin.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 20 March 2016. The main cabin area is furnished with soundproofing measures, ventilation, and heating as standard. A maximum of three fuel tanks can also be carried in the main cabin, accordingly reducing payload capacity, to increase the aircraft's flight endurance. In addition to the large sliding doors at either side of the main cabin, separate hinged doors are present on either side of the cockpit; an optional pilot-controlled trapdoor, to accommodate supply drops or surveillance payloads, may also be installed in the center of the cabin floor without any design changes required.\\"Porter in England.\\" Flight International, 1 January 1960. p. 13.

Operational history The PC-6 is noted for its Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) performance on almost any type of terrain - it can take off within a distance of and land within a distance of while carrying a payload of 2,646 lbs (1,200 kg). Thanks to its STOL performance, the PC-6 holds the world record for highest landing by a fixed-wing aircraft, at , on the Dhaulagiri glacier in Nepal.Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar 2008, p. 358. Due to the type's favourable STOL characteristics, described by Flying Magazine as being \\"one of the most helicopter-like airplanes in terms of takeoff performance\\", Pilatus has deliberately marketed the PC-6 towards helicopter operators at times, feeling the type to be complementary to their typical mode of operation. According to Pilatus, the PC-6 can provide very similar surveillance capabilities to a rotorcraft at a significantly lower cost to operate and procure.Moxon, Julian. \\"Small is beautiful.\\" Flight International, 12 June 1996. Peruvian Air Force PC-6, 2014 During its early service, the PC-6 Porter was noted for its high level of comfort and usability against competing aircraft.Fricker 1962, pp. 100‚Äì101. The type has also proven to have a long service life; by 1993, roughly 440 of the 500 PC-6 Turbo Porters completed by that point were still in service.Moll 1993, p. 64. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-controlled airline Air America operated up to 23 PC-6s at a time. Many of these were operated in the South-East Asia region, including South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The type was used for various missions including paradropping supplies to troops, passenger transport, psy ops, reconnaissance, prisoner conveyance, airborne radio relay, and other intelligence operations. Since 1976, the Austrian Air Force has operated a fleet of 12 PC-6 Porters as the mainstay of their fixed-wing transport fleet; the type has been used in various support roles, including transport, Search and Rescue, firefighting, observation, target-towing and paradropping.Moxon, Julian. \\"Austria ready to modernise.\\" Flight International, 27 October 1999.\\"The Austrian Air Force - In the Past and Today.\\" Austrian Armed Forces, Retrieved: 20 March 2016.

They are evergreen trees growing to tall, with alternate pinnate leaves with 4 or 6 opposite leaflets (no terminal leaflet). The fruit is a drupe. Several species, but principally M. bijugatus, are widely cultivated in their native areas and elsewhere in Central America and the Caribbean for their fruit. Some species of the related genus Talisia are sometimes included in Melicoccus. ;Species *Melicoccus antioquensis Acevedo-Rodr√≠guez ‚Äî Colombia *Melicoccus aymardii Acevedo-Rodr√≠guez ‚Äî Venezuela *Melicoccus bijugatus Jacq. ‚Äì Mamoncillo (Colombia, Venezuela) *Melicoccus espritosantensis Acevedo- Rodr√≠guez ‚Äî eastern Brazil *Melicoccus jimenezii (Alain) Acevedo-Rodr√≠guez ‚Äî Dominican Republic *Melicoccus lepidopetalus Radlk. ‚Äì Motoyo√© or Yva Povo (Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay), Argentina *Melicoccus novogranatensis Acevedo- Rodr√≠guez ‚Äî Colombia and Ecuador *Melicoccus oliviformis HBK ‚Äî Mexico, Central and South America and Trinidad *Melicoccus pedicellaris (Sagot ex Radlk.)

This description was based on M. bijugatus trees which were cultivated in Jamaica. In 1760, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin described the first species in Browne's genus, which he named M. bijugatus. In 1762 Linnaeus used a spelling variation of the name Melicocca bijuga. Over the next two centuries, Linnaeus' spelling variation was used in almost all publications. A proposal was made in 1994 to conserve Melicocca over Melicoccus, but the proposal was rejected, leading to a restoration of the original version of the name. In 1888 German taxonomist Ludwig Radlkofer placed Melicoccus in the tribe Melicocceae together with eight other genera. In his monograph on the Neotropical members of the tribe (Talisia and Melicoccus) Pedro Acevedo-Rodr√≠guez suggested that although Talisia and Melicoccus appeared to form a monophyletic group, the other (Old World) genera probably did not belong to the same lineage.

He was the head football coach at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, from 1953 until 2012. From 1949 to 1952, he was the head football coach at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. With a career record of 489‚Äì138‚Äì11, Gagliardi has the most wins of any coach in college football history. His Saint John's Johnnies teams won four national titles: the NAIA Football National Championship in 1963 and 1965, and the NCAA Division III Football Championship in 1976 and 2003. Gagliardi was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006. Early life John Gagliardi was born to Ventura and Antonietta Gagliardi in Trinidad, Colorado, in 1926. He began coaching football at Trinidad Catholic High School in 1943, at the age of 16, when his high school coach was called into service during World War II. He was a player-coach his senior year of high school and continued to coach high school football at St. Mary's High School while obtaining his college degree at Colorado College. College coaching career At the age of 22, with six years of high school coaching, Gagliardi was hired at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. In four seasons as head coach at Carroll, Gagliardi compiled a 24‚Äì6‚Äì1 record, winning three Montana Collegiate Conference championships. After the 1952 season, Gagliardi left Carroll for Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. Pro Football Hall of Fame player Johnny \\"Blood\\" McNally coached football at St. John's from 1950 to 1952. On leaving the job he said \\"Nobody can win at St. John's.\\" In 60 seasons coaching the Saint John's Johnnies, Gagliardi won a school and conference record 27 Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) titles and four national championships: in 1963 (at the Camellia Bowl), 1965, 1976, and 2003. His record at Saint John's was 465‚Äì132‚Äì10, bringing his career college football mark to 489‚Äì138‚Äì11. On November 8, 2003, Gagliardi broke the record for career coaching wins with his 409th victory, passing Grambling State's Eddie Robinson. The 13,107 fans who witnessed the victory over Bethel at Saint John's Clemens Stadium were the largest crowd in NCAA Division III history. The win also gave Saint John's its 23rd MIAC championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA Division III playoffs. The Johnnies went on to win the national championship with a 24‚Äì6 victory over Mount Union. In 1993, Jostens and the J Club of St. John's University began awarding the Gagliardi Trophy annually to the most outstanding player in NCAA Division III. On August 11, 2006, Gagliardi and Florida State's Bobby Bowden became the first active head coaches to be enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. (Nevada's Chris Ault had been inducted in 2002 and returned to coaching two years later.) Gagliardi was known for his unique coaching approach, which he called \\"Winning with No's.\\" He instructed his players not to call him \\"coach\\", did not use a whistle or blocking sleds, prohibited tackling in practices, did not require his players to lift weights, and limited his team practices to 90 minutes. Gagliardi announced his retirement from coaching on November 19, 2012. Gagliardi died on October 7, 2018, at the age of 91. Awards In 2003, Gagliardi received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching Award from the United States Sports Academy. He won the 2007 Liberty Mutual Division III Coach of the Year. In 2009, Gagliardi won the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award from the American Football Coaches Association. Gagliardi received the National College Football Awards Association's (NCFAA) Contributions to College Football Award in 2013. He was inducted into the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006, the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 2015, and Saint John's University's J-Club Hall of Honor in 2018..

May 27), 1837, Ostrogozhsk ‚Äì April 6 (O.S. March 24), 1887, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian painter and art critic. He was an intellectual leader of the Russian democratic art movement in 1860-1880. Life Self portrait, 1867 Kramskoi came from an impoverished petit-bourgeois family. From 1857 to 1863 he studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts; he reacted against academic art and was an initiator of the \\"revolt of fourteen\\" which ended with the expulsion from the Academy of a group of its graduates, who organized the Artel of Artists (\\"\\"). Influenced by the ideas of the Russian revolutionary democrats, Kramskoi asserted the high public duty of the artist, principles of realism, and the moral substance and nationality of art. He became one of the main founders and ideologists of the Company of Itinerant Art Exhibitions (or Peredvizhniki). In 1863‚Äì1868 he taught at the drawing school of a society for the promotion of applied arts. He created a gallery of portraits of important Russian writers, scientists, artists and public figures (Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy, 1873, Ivan Shishkin, 1873, Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov, 1876, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, 1879, Sergei Botkin, 1880) in which expressive simplicity of composition and clarity of depiction emphasize profound psychological elements of character. Kramskoi's democratic ideals found their brightest expression in his portraits of peasants, which portrayed a wealth of character-details in representatives of the common people. In one of Kramskoi‚Äôs most well known paintings, Christ in the Desert (1872, Tretyakov gallery), he continued Alexander Ivanov's humanistic tradition by treating a religious subject in moral‚Äìphilosophical terms. He imbued his image of Christ with dramatic experiences in a deeply psychological and vital interpretation, evoking the idea of his heroic self- sacrifice. Aspiring to expand the ideological expressiveness of his images, Kramskoi created art that existed on the cusp of portraiture and genre- painting (\\"Nekrasov during the period of 'Last songs,'\\" 1877‚Äì78; \\"Unknown Woman,\\" 1883; \\"Inconsolable grief,\\" 1884; all in Tretyakov gallery). These paintings disclose their subjects' complex and sincere emotions, their personalities and fates. The orientation of Kramskoi‚Äôs art, his acute critical judgments about it, and his persistent quest for objective public criteria for the evaluation of art exerted an essential influence on the development of realist art and aesthetics in Russia in the last third of the nineteenth century. Kramskoi was considered an eccentric for giving his works to customers in expensive frames and not charging money for it.

Den Oudsten Bussen B.V. was a Dutch coachbuilder and components manufacturer. The company was founded in 1926 by a local carriage-builder, Marinus den Oudsten. Its headquarters were just outside the city of Woerden. It eventually ceased all activities after being declared bankrupt in 2002. The company, which was family-owned, had a profound influence on public transport in the Netherlands from the 1960s right up until the late 1990s. It mainly built coaches and bodyparts for buses that were assembled on chassis made by DAF, Leyland, Volvo, and Iveco. In 1986 one of the family members, Jan den Oudsten, acquired a Canadian bus manufacturer and renamed it New Flyer Industries Ltd.. Den Oudsten Bussen BV was considered a separate company and had no institutional relations with New Flyer Industries. The official emblems of both companies were nevertheless identical. The Dutch company also cooperated with manufacturer Nova Bus Ltd to introduce and manufacture low-floor buses in North America. Many older models of Den Oudsten buses that are no longer used in the Netherlands were shipped to other countries, where they can still be seen on local public transport duties. Den Oudsten buses have been spotted as far afield as Poland, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Vietnam, Trinidad and Tobago, Romania and Cuba. These exports were sometimes repainted, while others retained their original Dutch advertisements, numberplates, or transport company emblems. The eventual bankruptcy of the company is believed to have been caused by the increasingly competitive nature of the market. Its household effects were sold in a public auction in 2002; the most notable highlights were the company's original 1962 Chevrolet Apache fire-engine[1] and an unfinished prototype for its latest low-floor line. Many bus enthusiasts in the Netherlands are attempting to preserve several of the old models for posterity.

It was created in 1988 by , and originally named LHarc. A complete rewrite of LHarc, tentatively named LHx, was eventually released as LH. It was then renamed to LHA to avoid conflicting with the then-new MS-DOS 5.0 \`LH\` (\\"load high\\") command. According to early documentation, LHA is pronounced like La. Although no longer much used in the west, LHA remains popular in Japan. It was used by id Software to compress installation files for their earlier games, including Doom and Quake. LHA has been ported to many operating systems and is still the main archiving format used on the Amiga computer, although it competed with LZX in the mid 1990s. This was due to Aminet, the world's largest archive of Amiga-related software and files, standardising on Stefan Boberg's implementation of LHA for the Amiga. Microsoft released the Microsoft Compressed (LZH) Folder Add-on, which was designed for the Japanese version of Windows XP. The Japanese version of Windows 7 ships with the LZH folder add-on built-in. Users of non-Japanese versions of Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate can also install the LZH folder add-on by installing the optional Japanese language pack from Windows Update. Compression methods In an LZH archive, the compression method is stored as a five-byte text string, e.g. . These are the third through seventh bytes of the file. =Canonical LZH= LHarc compresses files using an algorithm from Yoshizaki's earlier LZHUF product, which was modified from LZARI developed by , but uses Huffman coding instead of arithmetic coding. LZARI uses Lempel‚ÄìZiv‚ÄìStorer‚ÄìSzymanski with arithmetic coding. ;lh0 :No compression method is applied to the source data. ;lh1 :This method is introduced in LHarc version 1. :It supports 4 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 60 bytes of matching length. Dynamic Huffman encoding is used. ;lh2 :lh1 variant. This method supports 8 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 256 bytes of matching length. Dynamic Huffman encoding is used. ;lh3 :lh2 variant with Static Huffman. ;lh4, lh5, lh6, lh7 :Methods 4, 5, 6, 7 support 4, 8, 32, 64 KiB sliding window respectively, with support of maximum 256 bytes of matching length. Static Huffman encoding is used. lh5 is first introduced in LHarc 2, followed by lh6 in LHA 2.66 (MSDOS), lh7 in LHA 2.67 beta (MSDOS). LHA itself never compresses into lh4. ;lhd :Technically it is not a compression method, but it is used in .LZH archive to indicate that the compressed object is an empty directory. =Joe Jared extensions= Joe Jared extended LZSS to use larger dictionaries. ;lh8, lh9, lha, lhb, lhc, lhe :Dictionary (sliding window) sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 KiB respectively. Jared ported LZH to Atari. The fact that lh8 is the same as lh7 was an oversight. Files using larger numbered methods may as well not exist, as Jared only considers them planned features.Jared (1998). lzhformat.html =UNLHA32 extensions= UNLHA32.DLL uses its own method for testing purposes. ;lhx :It uses 128‚Äì256 KiB dictionary. =PMarc extensions= These compression methods are created by PMarc, a CP/M archiver created by Miyo.

Seldom generated, decompressor is reverse-engineered. ;pm2 :lh5 variant, 4K sliding window. ;pms :Used to indicate PMarc self-extracting archive. Should be skipped to reveal the real format. =LArc extensions= LArc uses the same file format as .LZH, but was written by Kazuhiko Miki, Haruhiko Okumura and Ken Masuyama, with extension name \\".LZS\\". The program seems to have come before LZH. It uses a binary search tree in the LZ matching. ;lzs :It supports 2 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 17 bytes of matching length. ;lz2 :It is similar to lzs, except dictionary size and match length can be changed. ;lz3 :Unknown. ;lz4 :No compression method is applied to the source data. ;lz5 :It supports 4 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 17 bytes of matching length. ;lz7 ;lz8 :Unknown. Common implementations appear to only support lzs, lz5, plus the storage-only lz4. Issues =LHICE/ICE= There are copies of LHICE marked as version 1.14. According to Okumura, LHICE is not written by Yoshi. =y2k11 bug= Because of a bug, DOS timestamps from Level 0 and 1 headers after the year 2011 will be set to 1980, meaning that some utilities need to be patched. This is caused by a bug that interprets the unsigned 8-bit year number bitfield as a 5-bit number. The maximum year should be 2107 instead. The newer Level 2 and 3 headers use a 32-bit Unix time instead. It suffers from the Year 2038 problem.Nifty's LHA Format Notes, Other data formats. =Header size= According to Micco, the author of a popular LHA library UNLHA32.DLL, many LHA implementations do not check for the length of LHA file headers when reading the archive. Two problems could emerge from this scenario: a buffer-overrun may occur for naive implementations assuming a 4KB max size from the original specification; antivirus software may skip over files with such large headers and fail to scan for a virus. A similar problem exists with ARJ. Micco reported this problem to Japanese authorities, but they do not consider it a valid vulnerability. Micco went so far to conclude the development of UNLHA32 and advise people to give up on the format. Nevertheless, they came back in 2017 to fix a DLL hijacking issue.

There are two types of tikkun, a tikkun kor'im and a tikkun soferim. Tikkun kor'im A tikkun kor'im. A tikkun kor'im or tiqqun qor'im (readers' tikkun) is a study guide used when preparing to chant [lein] the Torah reading from the Torah in a synagogue. Each tikkun contains two renditions of the masoretic text in Hebrew. The right side of each page is written with the cantillation marks and vowel points, while the left is written in unpointed Hebrew, as it appears in the actual scroll. People who chant from the Torah must learn the tune and the pronunciation of the words beforehand, as the scroll itself has neither points nor cantillation marks, and because there are places where the word to be read (the Qere) differs from that written (the Kethib) in the scroll. Tikkun soferim A tiqqun soferim (scribes' tikkun) is similar, but is designed as a guide or model text for scribes writing a copy of the Torah by hand. It contains additional information of use to scribes, such as directions concerning writing particular words, traditions of calligraphic ornamentation, and information about spacing and justification. For instance, it helps the scribe to know how many letters there are per line, so a tikkun soferim gives the size of each line, measured in yud-widths (because yud is the smallest Hebrew letter).

He earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from the University of Chicago in 1947 and continued his studies there, receiving a master's degree in political science in 1951. While at Chicago, he met fellow student Ann Creighton Collar, and they were married in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1951. They had four sons‚ÄîGeorge, Joshua, Matthew, and Michael‚Äîand seven grandchildren.  Early journalism  Broder began working as a journalist while pursuing his master's degree, serving as editor of The Chicago MaroonDavid Broder Alumni Medal and later at the Hyde Park Herald. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1951, where he wrote for the newspaper U.S. Forces Austria (USFA) Sentinel, until he was discharged from the Army in 1953. In 1953 Broder reported for the Pantagraph newspaper in Bloomington, Illinois, covering Livingston and Woodford counties in the central part of the state. From there he moved to the Congressional Quarterly in Washington D.C., in 1955, where he apprenticed under senior reporter Helen Monberg and got his first taste of covering congressional politics. During his four-and-a-half years at CQ, Broder also worked for The New York Times as a freelance writer. In 1960 Broder joined the Washington Star as a junior political writer covering the presidential election that year between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. During his five years at the Star, he was promoted to national political news reporter and was a weekly contributor to the paper's op-ed page. Broder left the Star for The New York Times in 1965, hired by well-known Times political reporter and columnist Tom Wicker to serve in its Washington bureau.  Washington Post columnist  After 18 months at The New York Times, Broder moved to The Washington Post, where he would remain for over 40 years, beginning as a reporter and weekly op-ed contributor. Later, he was given a second weekly column. Broder's columns were distributed initially through The Washington Post Wire Service and then later syndicated through The Washington Post Writers Group. His columns were carried by more than 300 newspapers for many years.

In a letter to the publications that ran his column, Broder said: \\"This change will allow me to focus entirely on the column, while freeing up the Post to use its budget for other news-section salaries and expenses.\\" In June 2008, Ken Silverstein, a columnist at Harper's magazine, alleged that Broder had accepted free accommodations and thousands of dollars in speaking fees from various business and healthcare groups, in one instance penning an opinion column supporting positions favored by one of the groups.Ken Silverstein, Harper's, June 12, 2008 Deborah Howell, The Washington Post's ombudsman at the time, wrote that Broder's acceptance of speaking fees appeared to be a violation of the paper's policy on outside speeches, as was the fact that some of the groups that paid Broder also lobby Congress.Deborah Howell, Washington Post, June 22, 2008. Howell pointed out that Broder said \\"he had cleared his speeches with Milton Coleman, deputy managing editor, or Tom Wilkinson, an assistant managing editor, but neither remembered him mentioning them.\\"  Pulitzer Prize  Broder won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1973 and was the recipient of numerous awards and academic honors before and after. In his Pulitzer Prize acceptance speech, Broder said:  Meet the Press and other broadcast media  For many years Broder appeared on Washington Week, Meet the Press, and other network television and radio news programs. It was announced at the close of the August 10, 2008, broadcast of Meet the Press that Broder was celebrating his 400th appearance on that program, on which he first appeared July 7, 1963.

During this career he travelled about one million miles (1.6 million km) and established more than one hundred missions and churches, mostly in the Western United States. He is best remembered for his extensive work in Colorado and the Alaska Territory, and for his efforts to suppress Native American languages. Youth, education, early career Sheldon Jackson was born in 1834 in Minaville in Montgomery County in eastern New York. His mother Delia (Sheldon) Jackson was a daughter of New York State Assembly Speaker Alexander Sheldon. Jackson graduated in 1855 from Union College in Schenectady, New York, and from the Presbyterian Church's Princeton Theological Seminary in 1858. That same year, he became an ordained Presbyterian minister and married the former Mary Vorhees. He wanted to become a missionary overseas, but the Presbyterian board told the 5-foot Jackson, who had weak eyesight and was often ill, that he would be better suited for duty in the United States. He hence first worked in the north-central and western United States, which were still vast and lightly populated areas during the American Civil War and thereafter. Jackson's first assignment was at the Choctaw mission in Oklahoma Territory, where he worked until poor health forced him to go back East in 1859. After his recovery he was appointed to La Crescent in Houston County in southeastern Minnesota, where he extended his field hundreds of miles beyond the actual station. He spent ten years in Minnesota and Wisconsin, having organized or assisted in the establishment of twenty-three churches. Jackson's travels took him throughout the American West. With the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, a huge territory was opened to him. In the summer of 1869, Jackson went on a missionary tour using the railroad and stage lines, establishing a church a day. Based in Denver, Jackson became the Presbyterian missions superintendent for Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah Territory, Arizona Territory, and New Mexico Territory. He published from 1872 to 1882 the Rocky Mountain Presbyterian denominational newspaper, which included pictures of places in the West. Ultimately Jackson supervised the building of churches in at least twenty-two Colorado locations, including Greeley, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Monument, Ouray, and Fairplay in Park County in the central portion of the state. He frequently visited frontier areas to preach, such as the mining camp on Mount Bross in South Park, Colorado. A friend once said of Jackson and his dedication to the cause of Jesus Christ: \\"He would not hesitate if he thought he could save an old-hardened sinner, to mount a locomotive and let fly a Gospel message at a group by the wayside while going at a speed of forty miles an hour.\\" Laura King Van Dusen, \\"Sheldon Jackson's Fairplay Church: One of More than One Hundred in Western U.S.; Jackson Arrested, Jailed in Alaska; Contributed to Settlement of the West\\", Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 69-77. However, an area of the United States even more challenging awaited him. right North to Alaska Map showing Alaska position relative to lower 48 states USS Bear Reverend Jackson found his major life's work in the new territory of Alaska. In 1867, US Secretary of State William H. Seward, during the administration of U.S. President Andrew Johnson, had negotiated the Alaska Purchase from Russia. The huge territory, with 20,000 miles of coastline, was initially called by many skeptics \\"Seward's Folly\\".Have you been to the \\"polar bear garden\\"? The loc.gov Wise Guide In 1877, Jackson began his work in Alaska. He became committed to the Christian spiritual, educational, and economic wellbeing of the Alaska Natives. He founded numerous schools and training centers that served these native people. His prot√©g√©s included the Rev. Edward Marsden, a Tsimshian missionary among the Tlingit. Reverend Jackson had considerable common ground with another important American in the region. Captain Michael A. Healy of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, commander of the USRC Bear, was also known for his concern for the native Alaskan Inuit. During this time, Captain Healy, who had been the first African American to command a U.S. ship, was essentially the law enforcement officer of the U.S. government in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as a judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan Natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. His ship also carried doctors and provided the only available trained medical care to many isolated communities. The Native people throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect this skipper and called his ship \\"Healy's Fire Canoe\\". The Bear and Captain Healy were reportedly an inspiration for author Jack London, and feature prominently, along with Jackson, in James A. Michener's famous novel about Alaska. Captain Healy and the Reverend Jackson became allies of a sort. During visits to Siberia (across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast), Healy had observed that the Chukchi people in the remote Asian area had domesticated reindeer and used them for food, travel, and clothing. With the reductions in the seal and whale populations which had arisen from growing commercial fishing activities, and to aid Eskimos for transportation, Reverend Jackson and Captain Healy made numerous trips into Siberia and helped import nearly 1,300 reindeer to bolster the livelihoods of Native people. These became valuable tools in the provision of food, clothing and other necessities for Native peoples. This work was noted in the New York Sun newspaper in 1894. While Captain Healy was more of a law enforcement officer, Jackson was a humanitarian. Convinced that Americanization was the key to their future, Jackson actively discouraged the use of indigenous languages, traditional cultures, and spiritualities. Because he was worried that Native cultures would vanish with no records of their past (a process which his own educational efforts accelerated), he collected artifacts from those cultures on his many trips throughout the region. Jackson believed that political means would further his goals for the Alaskan people. He became a close friend of U.S. President Benjamin Harrison. He worked toward the passage of the Organic Act of 1884, which ensured that Alaska would begin to set up a judicial system and receive aid for education. As a result, Sheldon Jackson became the First General Agent of Education in Alaska. Education policy In 1885, Jackson was appointed General Agent of Education in the Alaska Territory. Concurrent with the values of the expanding colonial administration, Jackson undertook a policy of deliberate acculturation. In particular, Jackson advocated an English-only policy which forbade the use of indigenous languages. In allocating $25,000 of federal education monies in 1888 he wrote, \\"[N]o books in any Indian language shall be used, or instruction given in that language to Indian pupils.\\" In a letter to newly hired teachers in 1887 he wrote: : It is the purpose of the government in establishing schools in Alaska to train up English speaking American citizens. You will therefore teach in English and give special prominence to instruction in the English language‚Ä¶. [Y]our teaching should be pervaded by the spirit of the Bible.\\"Dauenhauer, Richard. 1982. Two missions to Alaska. Pacific Historian 26(1).29-41. (emphasis added) The legacy of Jackson's educational policy is clearly evident in the now moribund state of Alaska's indigenous languages.Krauss, Michael E. 1980. Alaska Native Languages: Past, Present, and Future. (Alaska Native Language Center Research Paper 4). Fairbanks: Alaska Native Language Center. Decades of punishment for speaking Native languages resulted in greatly decreased transmission, with the result that few indigenous Alaskans still speak indigenous languages in the 21st century.Krauss, Michael E. 2007. Native languages of Alaska. The Vanishing Voices of the Pacific Rim, ed. by O. Miyaoka, O. Sakiyama & M.E. Krauss. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Jackson was arrested and jailed in Sitka, for obstructing a public highway with a fence and building used for a school that he had constructed for the education of Indian children. The officials who charged him did not want the Indians educated. But the next year, President Grover Cleveland, Harrison's political rival, fired four territorial officials responsible for Jackson's arrest and dismissed the false charges against Jackson. Death and legacy Jackson died on May 2, 1909, in Asheville, North Carolina, sixteen days short of his 75th birthday. He had been planning a trip to Denver at the time of his death to attend meetings three weeks later of the Presbyterian general assembly, to visit some of the chapels that he had built in Colorado, and to renew acquaintances with old friends. He is interred in his hometown of Minaville, New York. The former Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska, was named after him. The Sheldon Jackson Museum, located on the Sheldon Jackson College grounds, is the oldest concrete building in the state, and houses much of Sheldon Jackson's collection as well as other examples of Tlingit, Inuit, and Aleut culture. Sheldon Jackson Street is found in the College Village subdivision of Anchorage, a neighborhood next to the University of Alaska Anchorage campus where the streets are named for colleges and universities (the street forms a loop with Emory Street). In 1874, while in Fairplay in Park County, Colorado, Jackson built the still standing Sheldon Jackson Memorial Chapel, renamed the South Park Community Church, a one-room Victorian Gothic structure, listed in 1977 on the National Register of Historic Places. Archival collections The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a collection of Jackson‚Äôs correspondence, journals, photographs, photographs, scrapbooks, notebooks and miscellaneous indices and ephemera. Additional correspondence by Sheldon Jackson is also held at Princeton Theological Seminary. Jackson‚Äôs personal papers include photographs by Eadweard Muybridge and H.H. Brodeck. The Presbyterian Historical Society also holds the Sheldon Jackson Library, which was Jackson‚Äôs personal library donated by him to the historical society. The Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka maintains three to four thousand Alaskan artifacts collected by Jackson during his lifetime.

History Similar to the Carlisle Indian School, Sheldon Jackson College (SJC) was initially formed as a \\"training\\" school for Alaska Native boys.National Native News, 15 April 2010, \\"On This Day\\". The school was founded in 1878 by Fannie Kellogg and future Governor of Alaska John G. Brady for the Tlingit people. Initially known as the Sitka Industrial and Training School, it nearly closed in 1882 after its original facility, located over a military barracks, burned down. The Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson came to the rescue of the school, raising funds through a national campaign, leading to the construction of a new building on the site of the present campus. In 1910, after Rev. Jackson died, the school was renamed in his honor. The institution added a boarding high school in 1917, and a college program in 1944. The college program gained accreditation in 1966 and the high school was closed the following year. =Closure= The school's educational accreditation was reviewed by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and State of Alaska, a process that happens nationally with colleges and universities. About this process, President David Dobler said, \\"SJC‚Äôs current authorization to operate as an Alaska post-secondary institution has been extended until July 2006, and SJC, at that time, will be required to provide the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education (ACPE) with documentation of financial and administrative capacity in order for authorization to be renewed.\\" (Dobler left the office of President in 2002.) Similarly, the college was under a \\"show cause\\" order from the Northwest Commission and was required to \\"show cause\\" why its regional accreditation should not be revoked. On June 29, 2007, all academic operations were suspended and all faculty and staff were dismissed due to cash flow shortages. The Board of Trustees gathered all staff and informed them that June 29 would be the final day of employment. They were also informed all health insurance coverage would cease at that time. On July 17, 2007, the Alaska Commission on Post-secondary Education announced the cancellation of Sheldon Jackson College's authorization to operate a college in Alaska. The college appealed the decision, but was ultimately shut down. In March 2008, the official website for the school went off-line. In the summer of 2008, the college opened its dorms and facilities for use by local workers and companies. In 2010 the school library collection of rare books and artwork was boxed and stored.Uncertain future faces books at Sheldon Jackson College library, Andi McDaniel, KCAW - Sitka (audio file) On February 1, 2011, the Board of Trustees transferred the main campus to Alaska Arts Southeast, Inc., the non- profit parent organization to the Sitka Fine Arts Camp.PCUSA.org: \\"Arts Program To Take Over Sheldon Jackson College\\" Beginning in 2018, Outer Coast College students, professors and faculty members have been hosted on the main campus.

It's octagonal shape may have been influenced by architectural philosophies of O.S. Fowler. The main campus buildings were designed by the, then just starting, firm of Ludlow and Peabody of Boston with aspects of western stick style. Beams were of Douglas fir and design was kept simple and exposed for easy construction and to demonstrate \\"honesty in building\\". In 1972, the Sheldon Jackson Museum building was added as a single property to the National Register of Historic Places. The entire school, comprising 18 contributing properties and 3 non- contributing buildings, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2001. and =Campus buildings= The contributing properties to the historic district, built between 1895 and the 1930s, are: *The Sheldon Jackson Museum, , AHRS# SIT-007, built 1895. *The North Cottage, , AHRS# SIT-00254, built 1900. *The Ceramics Building, also known as the Storehouse, , AHRS# SIT-00553, built 1910-1911. *The Richard H.

Additional campus buildings are: *Stratton Library, built 1974. Stratton Library Stratton Library was an academic library at the college. Prior to the construction of the building the university's collection was held in the Yaw Building. Prior to the 1955 construction of the Yaw Building, the books were held in a prefabricated army building that had been abandoned and moved onto campus in 1947. The Stratton library building contained 48,000 items in its collection with over 10 percent of all material being directly related to Alaska's history, including many first edition books and rare periodicals. In December 2010 the collection was broken up. Rare glass plate photographic negatives were loaned to the National Park Service, other \\"Alaskana\\" was split among local public and academic libraries, and the remainder of the collection was offered for sale to the general public. The building itself was sold to the State of Alaska. Sheldon Jackson Museum Sheldon Jackson College in summer 1991. The Sheldon Jackson Museum is a Native American museum located on the former campus of Sheldon Jackson College. Many of the artifacts were originally collected by Rev. Sheldon Jackson in his travels through rural Alaska. Sheldon Jackson Museum was founded in 1887, becoming the first museum in the state of Alaska. When it outgrew its temporary quarters, a new specially dedicated concrete structure was constructed between 1895 and 1897 and, upon completion, became the first concrete structure built in Alaska. The museum, collection, and grounds are currently owned and administered by the State of Alaska. Organized within the Alaska Department of Education & Early Development, Division of Libraries, Archives and Museums, the Sheldon Jackson Museum was purchased by the State in the mid-1980s during the administration of Governor Bill Sheffield. =Collection= Many of the artifacts housed in the museum (over 5,000) were originally collected by Rev. Sheldon Jackson in his travels through rural Alaska. The museum's collection almost exclusively focus on Alaskan Native groups such as the Aleuts, Athabascans, Eskimos, and Tlingit/Tsimshian. An affiliated advocacy group, Friends of the Sheldon Jackson Museum, operate an on-site museum gift shop that exclusively carries items crafted by Alaska Native artists. The organization also sponsors several museum programs, including the Alaska Native Artist Demonstrators Program during the summer months.

They grow naturally across Australasia, Papuasia, Melanesia, western Polynesia, east Malesia and Southeast Asia, including across mainland Australia, especially diverse in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, the Torres Strait Islands, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Hawaii, Indonesia and the Philippines. They grow in a wide variety of natural habitats, from rainforests, gallery forests and coastal forests to arid savannas and heaths. Mainland Australia, especially the eastern Queensland and New South Wales rainforests and the monsoon tropics, harbours the global centre of Alectryon species diversity, having 15 species, 12 of them endemic to Australia. In the continent of, combined New Guinea including Papua New Guinea and West Papua, Australia and all of their continental islands, including the Torres Strait Islands, known collectively in biogeography as the Sahul continent, lives the even greater diversity and endemism of 21 and 19 species, respectively.

In Australia: * A. ramiflorus small trees only remain naturally growing in a very restricted area of southeastern Queensland, thus they have obtained the \\"endangered\\" species global conservation status of the IUCN (1998) and 2013 national and state conservation statuses of the Australian and Queensland governments. * A. repandodentatus small trees in northeastern Qld, the Torres Strait Islands and New Guinea have obtained the \\"vulnerable\\" species global conservation status of the IUCN (1998), and the Queensland state government's 2013 \\"endangered\\" species conservation status. * A. semicinereus small trees in eastern Qld have obtained the Qld government \\"near threatened\\" species conservation status. Naming and classification German botanist Joseph Gaertner formally named and described this genus and the New Zealand type species A. excelsus in 1788. The name Alectryon is derived from Greek word for \\"rooster\\". This refers to the cockscomb appearance of aril on the fruit.

(born 8 December 1951) is a ni-Vanuatu politician. He is a former MP from Pentecost Island in Penama Province. He was Prime Minister of Vanuatu from 11 December 2004 until 22 September 2008, and is the current Deputy Prime Minister since 16 May 2014. LinÃÑi is the brother of Walter LinÃÑi, one of the founders of the modern Republic of Vanuatu. Ham LinÃÑi is the current leader of the National United Party (VNUP).  Prime Minister of Vanuatu  The VNUP became the largest party in parliament in the July 2004 parliamentary elections, with 10 of 52 seats. Ham LinÃÑi became a candidate for Prime Minister, but was defeated by Serge Vohor, though LinÃÑi also had the support of the largest faction of the Vanua'aku Pati, led by outgoing Prime Minister Edward Natapei. He continued to dispute the results and lead the opposition to the Vohor government until 20 August 2004, when Vohor and LinÃÑi formed a National Unity Government, in which Vohor remained Prime Minister and LinÃÑi became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs. In December 2004, Vohor was ousted after only a few months in office in a no confidence vote for unilaterally establishing relations with Taiwan (Republic of China), and LinÃÑi was elected Prime Minister by the Parliament. One of LinÃÑi's first actions after taking office was the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. On 21 March 2006, LinÃÑi survived a no confidence vote in Parliament by a vote of 30 to 20. The opposition, led by former Prime Minister Serge Vohor, had accused the LinÃÑi government of weaknesses from a controversial proposal to monopolize kava exports. The Opposition had believed that some parliament members who had supported the government would defect, but few did. LinÃÑi and Vanuatu's council of ministers declared a state of emergency for the capital city of Port Vila in March 2007 following tribal clashes between people from the islands of Tanna and Ambrym. The clashes, which took place in Blacksands squatter settlement area on the outskirts of Port Vila, killed two people. The fighting broke out when people from Tanna alleged that an Ambrym man used black magic to harm a Tannese person.  Subsequent political career  LinÃÑi failed to gain a second term as Prime Minister after his National United Party suffered losses in Parliament during the general election held on 2 September 2008, although he was re-elected to his own parliamentary seat.\\"Uncertainty after Vanuatu's general election\\", ABC Radio Australia, 9 September 2008. Edward Natapei of the Vanuaku Pati narrowly defeated his nearest opponent, Maxime Carlot Korman, leader of the Vanuatu Republican Party, with 27 to 25 votes in Parliament in a vote three weeks later on 22 September, succeeding LinÃÑi as Prime Minister. Natapei pledged to continue many of LinÃÑi's policies and incorporate them in his new government. These included anti-corruption measures, transparency, political stability and good governance. Natapei named LinÃÑi to his cabinet as Minister of Infrastructure and Public Utilities on 22 September 2008. In Natapei's first reshuffle LinÃÑi was given the post of Minister of Justice & Social Welfare whilst remaining as Deputy Prime Minister. However, in Natapei second major cabinet reshuffle, which took place in November 2009, LinÃÑi was removed as Deputy Prime Minister and replaced by Sato Kilman. Natapei had learned that LinÃÑi's Vanuatu National United Party and the Vanuatu Republican Party were planning a vote of no confidence measure against him. In response to the no confidence plan, Natapei sacked half his cabinet members, including LinÃÑi, and removed the Vanuatu National United Party and the Vanuatu Republican Party from his cabinet, replacing them with sixteen members of the opposition. Ham LinÃÑi returned to government when Sato Kilman became Prime Minister on 2 December 2010, having ousted Natapei in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Kilman appointed LinÃÑi Deputy Prime Minister, as well as Minister for Trade, Commerce, Industries and Tourism.Cabinet of Vanuatu, CIA, 20 December 2010\\"New govt\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 7 December 2010 LinÃÑi held the position until 24 April 2011, when Kilman was in turn ousted in turn in a vote of no confidence, and replaced by Serge Vohor. Vohor did not appoint LinÃÑi to his cabinet. Three weeks later, however, on 13 May, Vohor's election and premiership were voided by the Court of Appeal, and the Kilman government was restored, complete with Ham LinÃÑi as Deputy Prime Minister.\\"Vanuatu Court decision results in change of government\\", ABC Radio Australia, 13 May 2011 This lasted for only a month; on 16 June, the Kilman premiership was voided on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court's Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, and LinÃÑi lost office once more.

Skoglund creates surrealist images by building elaborate sets or tableaux, furnishing them with carefully selected colored furniture and other objects, a process of which takes her months to complete. Finally, she photographs the set, mostly including live models. The works are characterized by an overwhelming amount of one object and either bright, contrasting colors or a monochromatic color scheme. Biography Skoglund was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts on September 11, 1946. She spent her childhood all over the country including the states Maine, Connecticut, and California. She studied both art history and studio art at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, graduating in 1968. In 1967, she studied art history through her college's study abroad program at the Sorbonne and √âcole du Louvre in Paris, France. After graduating in 1969, she went to graduate school at the University of Iowa, where she studied filmmaking, multimedia art, and printmaking. In 1971, she earned her Master of Arts and in 1972 a Master of Fine Arts in painting. In 1972, Skoglund began working as a conceptual artist in New York City. She taught herself photography to document her artistic endeavors, and experimenting with themes of repetition. She also become interested in advertising and high technology‚Äîtrying to marry the commercial look with a noncommercial purpose, combining the technical focus found in the commercial world and bringing that into the fine art studio. Skoglund created repetitive, process-oriented art through the techniques of mark-making and photocopying. For example, her 1973 Crumpled and Copied artwork centered on her repeatedly crumpled and photocopied a piece of paper. In 1978, she had produced a series of repetitious food item still life images. These photographs of food were presented in geometric and brightly colored environments so that the food becomes an integral part to the overall patterning, as in Cubed Carrots and Kernels of Corn, with its checkerboard of carrots on a white-spotted red plate placed on a cloth in the same pattern. Skoglund's works are quirky and idiosyncratic, and as former photography critic for The New York Times Andy Grundberg describes, they \\"evoke adult fears in a playful, childlike context\\". One of her most-known works, entitled Radioactive Cats, features green-painted clay cats running amok in a gray kitchen. An older man sits in a chair with his back facing the camera while his elderly wife looks into a refrigerator that is the same color as the walls. \\"The artist sculpted the life-size cats herself using chicken wire and plaster, and painted them bright green. She acquired used furniture and constructed a painted gray set, then asked two elderly neighbors living in her apartment building in New York City to pose as models.\\" The end product is a very evocative photograph. In an on-line Getty Center for Education in the Arts forum,Terry Barrett and Sydney Walker (2013) identify two viable interpretations of Radioactive Cats. The first is about social indifference to the elderly and the second is nuclear war and its aftermath, suggested by the artist‚Äôs title. Her 1990 work, \\"Fox Games has a similar feel to Radioactive Cats\\";it unleashes the imagination of the viewer is allowed to roam freely. A third and final often recognized piece by her features numerous fish hovering above people in bed late at night and is called Revenge of the Goldfish. The piece was used as cover art for the Inspiral Carpets album of the same name. Skoglund was an art professor at the University of Hartford between 1973 and 1976. She is currently teaching photography and art installation/multimedia at Rutgers University in New Jersey. In 2000, the Galerie Guy B√§rtschi in Geneva, Switzerland held an exhibition of 30 works by Sandy Skoglund, which served as a modest retrospective. The photographs ranged from the plates on tablecloths of the late 1970s to the more spectacular works of the 1980s and 1990s. The critic who reviewed the exhibition, Richard Leydier, commented that Skoglund criticism is littered with interpretations of all kinds, whether feminist, sociological, psychoanalytical or whatever. But, Skoglund claims not to be aware of these reading, saying, \\"What is the meaning of my work? For me, it's really in doing it.\\" In 2008, Skoglund completed a series titled \\"True Fiction Two\\". This project is similar to the \\"True Fiction\\" series that she began in 1986. This series was not completed due to the discontinuation of materials that Skoglund was using. Kodak canceled the production of the dye that Skoglund was using for her prints. Each image in \\"True Fiction Two\\" has been meticulously crafted to assimilate the visual and photographic possibilities now available in digital processes. Her works are held in numerous museum collections including the Museum of Contemporary Photography,mocp.org San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,sfmoma.org Montclair Art Museum and Dayton Art Institute.http://www.daytonartinstitute.org/art/collection- highlights/american/shimmering-madness Skoglund holds a faculty position at the Department of Arts, Culture and Media of University of Rutgers‚ÄìNewark in Newark, New Jersey.

It is available as a topical cream, once marketed by Novartis (however, Galderma has been promoting the compound in Canada since early 2007) under the trade name Elidel. Medical uses It has been proven to be effective in various inflammatory skin diseases, e.g., seborrheic dermatitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, oral lichen planus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are both calcineurin inhibitors and function as immunosuppressants. Side effects See also: Immunosuppressants in the treatment of dermatitis In January 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Elidel packaging would be required to carry a black box warning regarding the potential increased risk of lymph node or skin cancer, as for the similar drug tacrolimus. Whereas current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of such new drugs. Importantly, although the FDA has approved updated black-box warning for tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, the recent report of the American Academy of Dermatology Association Task Force finds that there is no causal proof that topical immunomodulators cause lymphoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer, and systemic immunosuppression after short-term or intermittent long-term topical application seems an unlikely mechanism. Another recent review of evidence concluded that postmarketing surveillance shows no evidence for this systemic immunosuppression or increased risk for any malignancy. However, strong debates and controversies continue regarding the exact indications of immunomodulators and their duration of use in the absence of active controlled trials. Dermatologists' and allergists' professional societies, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, have protested the inclusion of the black box warning. The AAAAI states \\"None of the information provided for the cases of lymphoma associated with the use of topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus in AD indicate or suggest a causal relationship.\\" Pharmacology Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam derivative. It has been shown in vitro that pimecrolimus binds to FKBP1A and also inhibits calcineurin. Thus pimecrolimus inhibits T-cell activation by inhibiting the synthesis and release of cytokines from T-cells. Pimecrolimus also prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells. Pimecrolimus, like tacrolimus, belongs to the ascomycin class of macrolactam immunosuppressives, acting by the inhibition of T-cell activation by the calcineurin pathway and inhibition of the release of numerous inflammatory cytokines, thereby preventing the cascade of immune and inflammatory signals. Pimecrolimus has a similar mode of action to that of tacrolimus but is more selective, with no effect on dendritic (Langerhans) cells.

Push processing involves developing the film for more time, possibly in combination with a higher temperature, than the manufacturer's recommendations. This technique results in effective overdevelopment of the film, compensating for underexposure in the camera. Visual characteristics Push processing allows relatively insensitive films to be used under lighting conditions that would ordinarily be too low for adequate exposure at the required shutter speed and aperture combination. This technique alters the visual characteristics of the film, such as higher contrast, increased grain and lower resolution. Saturated and distorted colours are often visible on colour film that has been push processed. Pull processing involves overexposure and underdevelopment, effectively decreasing the sensitivity of the processed film. It is achieved by developing the film for a shorter time, and possibly at a lower temperature. Film that has been pull processed will display the opposite change in visual characteristics. This may be deliberately exploited for artistic effect.

It was founded in 1936 and became a certified union in 1982: it is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Trades Union Congress. History of Dietetics and the BDA Dietetics really started from the middle of the nineteenth century when Florence Nightingale observed the importance of diet and nutrition to convalescence from the wars at that time. Following the appearance of the first dietitians in the United States at the start of the twentieth century we know that the first UK dietitians came from nursing sisters, then working in hospitals. The Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was the first hospital known to develop a dietetic department in 1924. The Infirmary launched the first dietetic diploma course around ten years after the creation of its dietetic department.https://www.bda.uk.com/about/about_bda/history The BDA‚Äôs history also emerged around the same time. The very first meeting of the Association was held on 24 January 1936 at St Thomas‚Äô Hospital in London. Since then the BDA has grown into an internationally respected and valued organisation. Mission and scope Its aims are to: * Advance the science and practice of dietetics and associated subjects; * Promote training and education in the science and practice of dietetics and associated subjects; * Regulate the relations between dietitians and their employer through the BDA Trade Union. Organisation and membership The BDA is a UK-wide membership organisation representing over 9,000 dietitians and dietetic support workers. Members of the association may use the post-nominal MBDA. The association also awards fellowship status to member dietitians who have significantly contributed to the development of the field. Fellows use the post-nominal FBDA. The BDA head office is in Birmingham. It has members from all four UK nations and some from overseas. The majority of the BDA's membership work in the National Health Service. Approximately one third of the membership work in other sectors, such as education, private industry, private practice and the media. In the UK, 'Dietitian' is a legally protected title. Unlike nutritionists and other food/nutrition titles, all dietitians are required to be educated to a certain level (a recognized UK degree level at least) and dietitians are the only food/nutrition professionals in the UK who must be regulated. The BDA comprises six departments: * The Executive Department (Andy Burman, Chief Executive, and Sue Kellie, Deputy Chief Executive). * Membership Services (Milly Durrant, Head of Department.) * Education & Professional Development (Najia Qureshi, Head of Department). * External Affairs (Jo Instone, Head of Department). * Trade Union (Annette Mansell-Green, Head of Department). * Business Support (Karen Leek, Head of Department). The BDA is a certified holder of the Information Standard. The Information Standard is a Department of Health certification scheme for health and social care information. Successful organisations can use the quality mark on materials to confirm that the information is from a reliable source. Campaigns The British Dietetic Association also administers the specialist register for dietitians and sports nutritionists (SeNR) working with elite sportspeople. In 2011, the BDA Chairman at the time, Helen Davidson, announced the creation of a brand new BDA national campaign. The aim of the campaign was to highlight levels of malnutrition in older people living in their own homes in the UK. Mind the Hunger Gap was deemed a great success with much coverage and publicity across the UK, including advising the UL soap Emmerdale on a community malnutrition storyline in early 2013. The BDA launched its most recent campaign Work Ready in 2016, which aims to highlight work-based health.  Publications  The British Dietetic Association produces a monthly magazine called Dietetics Today. Simret Bassra-Brar is the magazine's Editor. Its official journal is the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, which is published bimonthly by John Wiley & Sons.

Background and education He was born G√©rard Marcel Tisserand, but later adopted the stage name of Souzay from a village on the river Loire, now part of the commune Souzay-Champigny. He came from a musical family in Angers, France. His parents had met at one of the first performances of Pell√©as et M√©lisande in 1902; his mother and two brothers were singers, and his sister, 15 years older, was the soprano Genevi√®ve Touraine, who gave the first performance of Poulenc's Fian√ßailles pour rire in 1942. After his schooling at the Coll√®ge Rabelais in Chinon, he went to the Sorbonne in Paris to study philosophy, and while there he met the singer Pierre Bernac, who encouraged him to study singing. Souzay entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1940, studying with Claire Croiza and Jean- Emil Vanni-Marcoux. He actually began singing as a tenor, but in 1943, with advice from the leading operatic singer Henri Etcheverry, he became a baritone. He graduated from the Conservatoire in 1945 with two first prizes, the Prix de chant and the Prix de vocalise. While at the Conservatoire, he also tried his hand at composition and in 1942 three of his settings of poems by Paul Val√©ry were given a performance by Pierre Bernac. He went on to study voice with Bernac, although he subsequently expressed some differences with the latter's methods and ideas on pronunciation. He was eager not to limit himself to being a specialist in the French repertoire, and he made a detailed study of German lieder with Lotte Lehmann. Career G√©rard Souzay's public appearances began in 1945 with recitals and concerts, including a performance of Faur√©'s Requiem in a centenary tribute to the composer at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He rapidly established an international career as a recitalist, admired not only in French music but also for his command of the German repertoire, especially Schubert and Schumann. In recital, his first accompanist was Jacqueline Bonneau (who had been his contemporary at the Paris Conservatoire), but she was reluctant to travel and from 1954 onwards he formed a close musical and romantic partnership with the American pianist Dalton Baldwin which continued for the rest of his career. The two completed three tours of Southern Africa (1958‚Äì1973) to wildly enthusiastic audiencesDetails of Southern Africa tours Souzay's exceptional linguistic gifts enabled him to sing convincingly in 13 different languages including Hebrew, Portuguese and Russian. In contemporary music he performed in Honegger's La danse des morts and in the world premi√®re of Stravinsky's Canticum Sacrum. The composer Jacques Leguerney (1906‚Äì1997) wrote many songs for Souzay and for his sister. Souzay also sang Jocelyne Binet's Cycle de M√©lodies on seven poems by Paul √âluard in a 1955 recital program. His operatic career began in 1947 in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence, but it was not until the late 1950s that he extended his stage work ‚Äì though even then it did not take precedence over his recitals. His roles included Monteverdi's Orfeo, Mozart's Don Giovanni and Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro, Lescaut in Massenet's Manon, and M√©phistoph√©l√®s in Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust. One of his favorite and most successful roles was Golaud in Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. He did little operatic work after the 1960s, but continued his recital career, finally retiring from performance in the late 1980s. He spent the last years of his life giving master classes in the United States, Europe, and Japan: he was an inspiring teacher, preferring to work on phrasing and the mood of a song rather than French diction. He was a keen abstract painter, and in 1983 he published a book Sur mon chemin: pens√©es et dessinsSouzay, G. Sur mon chemin: pens√©es et dessins. Paris : Biblioth√®que des Arts, 1983. in which a selection of his paintings was accompanied by his written commentary, on art and life. He died at his home in Antibes in the south of France on 17 August 2004. Recordings G√©rard Souzay's first recordings were made in 1944 with the sopranos Germaine Lubin and Genevi√®ve Touraine. (These and some later ones with Elly Ameling were his only recorded duets.) He made other recordings in the 1940s for the small French company Bo√Æte √† Musique, and then signed a contract with English Decca. He subsequently recorded for Philips and EMI. A discography of his recordings has been published, listing over 750 titlesMorris, Manuel, (comp.). The recorded performances of G√©rard Souzay: a discography. New York ; London : Greenwood, 1991. He participated in complete recordings of the songs of Faur√© and Poulenc. On three occasions he won the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque, including one for his recording of the songs of Ravel. Later in his career, he sought to disown his early recordings and to veto the radio from broadcasting them, preferring his later versions of some of the same works. Much to the relief of admirers of the smooth and beautiful quality of his younger voice, he was not widely heeded, and many of his early recordings have been re-released to considerable acclaim. Reputation While critics agree the size of the voice was often found wanting, Souzay's musicianship, perfect diction, sense of style (particularly of the French m√©lodie) and detailed interpretation were never questioned, and found a perfect niche on the recital platform. When G√©rard Souzay died he had only been a connoisseur's delight, being somewhat forgotten by audiences and younger singers. On the other hand, the obituary notices were quick in recognising the importance of his contribution to 20th century singing. The Daily Telegraph said that he \\"rivalled Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau for the title of the greatest lyrical baritone of his age.\\"Obituary in The Daily Telegraph (London), Tuesday 7 September 2004. The New York Times described his voice as \\"not huge, but rich in color and tone, supple and sensual and lovely.\\" Souzay was \\"a sensualist, reacting viscerally to the music and allowing it to carry him in new directions in a given concert.\\" The Guardian judged that \\"the basis of his popularity in recital lay in his easily produced, vibrant, warm baritone. It was used by its owner with an innate sensibility and an unfaltering sense of style. His attractive art was founded, above all, on a very French approach, at once balanced and urbane, yet inwardly poetic.\\" In the 1950s, Souzay's style of singing became the object of some unexpected criticism when it was cited by Roland Barthes in one of his essays in Mythologies, \\"L'art vocal bourgeois\\".Barthes, Roland. \\"L'art vocal bourgeois\\", in Mythologies, (Paris, 1957), p.169. Referring to a recording of Faur√© songs, Barthes complained that Souzay invested particular words with superfluous emotion by means of an exaggerated phonetic dramatisation, and that by imposing his own \\"signs\\" of emotion he stifled the meaning of the words and music. Not everyone has agreed with Barthes's description of the style, let alone with the force of his argument, but these are strictures which would attach to many other singers besides Souzay and go to the heart of how vocal performance should be approached. (Indeed, some years later, Barthes made similar criticisms against the singing of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.Barthes, Roland. \\"Le grain du voix\\" in L'obvie et l'obtus, (Paris, Seuil, 1982), p.239).) Souzay regarded himself as a romantic. Never analytical or detached in his performances, he said: \\"For me music is limpid and speaks for itself. I can only offer my emotions when I sing\\".

He graduated from the University of Chicago 1976, later teaching both there and at Wayne State University. In 1991, he earned his PhD in linguistics from the University of Chicago. After his undergraduate years, Schiller turned to music performance and founded a music group called the \\"Long Island Sound Ensemble\\" and studied conducting in Vienna, Salzburg and Hancock, Maine. He was a frequent attendant at NY Philharmonic rehearsals until 1981. Chess career In 1974, Schiller was the Illinois Junior Champion. Schiller played for the University of Chicago team several times at the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship. Schiller was the Hawaii action and blitz champion for 1988/89. He was an organizer of the Hawaii International chess festivals 1994‚Äì98 including 1998 US Open California Champion 1995. Later that year, he appeared as a chess advisor for the music group Phish on some of the stops for their \\"Chess Tour\\" where they played an ongoing game of two chess moves per tour stop and some \\"band vs. audience\\" partial games as part of their stage performance. Schiller was an arbiter at several notable games and championships including the FIDE World Chess Championship 2000.

It traditionally includes the municipalities Flesberg, Nore og Uvdal and Rollag. Administratively, it now also includes Kongsberg.  Geography  Numedal is the southernmost valley of the major valleys in Eastern Norway. Numedal is largely a U-shaped valley. Most of the area is mountainous, especially west of the main valley, with steep valley sides. Running north‚Äìsouth, it extends between Flesberg in the south to R√∏dberg in the north, passing through the municipalities of Flesberg, Rollag and Nore og Uvdal. The Numedalsl√•gen, the third-longest river in Norway, flows through the valley before discharging into Oslofjord at Larvik.  Transportation  National Road 40 runs from Larvik. National Road 7 crosses Hardangervidda to Geilo. Numedal Line Railway (Numedalsbanen) was opened in 1927 and stopped operations in 1988. The former railroad track from Veggli to R√∏dberg is now used principally for cycling.  Economy  Agriculture and forestry are important industries in the valley along with hydropower generation, as well as growing tourist traffic.  Etymology  The name comes from ', the Old Norse name for the Numedalsl√•gen, and ' meaning \\"valley\\". The origin and meaning of the name are the same as that of Namdalen.  Attractions  A welcome sign to Numedal Numedalsl√•gen in Numedal The area along the Numedalsl√•gen from Flesberg up to the Hardangervidda through the valley has a large number of examples of Medieval Scandinavian architecture. There are still over 40 historic timber buildings and four stave churches: Flesberg Stave Church, Rollag Stave Church, Nore Stave Church and Uvdal Stave Church. Numedal was also the location of one of the \\"Nordmann's trails\\" (Nordmannsslepene), which were the old main roads between east and west over Hardangervidda. On the marked paths, remains of Stone Age dwelling places, bog iron works and grave mounds can be seen. Numedal also has several museums including Nore og Uvdal Open Air Museum (Nore og Uvdal Bygdetun) in Uvdal, Rollag Open Air Museum (Rollag Bygdetun) in Rollag, and D√•set Open Air Museum (D√•set bygdetun) at Flesberg. These are collections of historic buildings, mostly built in the traditional style common for the valley.

Although the word is sometimes used loosely to characterise anyone who is mean with their money, if such behaviour is not accompanied by taking delight in what is saved, it is not properly miserly. Misers as a type have been a perennial object of popular fascination and a fruitful source for writers and artists in many cultures. Accounting for misers One attempt to account for miserly behaviour was Sigmund Freud's theory of anal retentiveness, attributing the development of miserly behaviour to toilet training in childhood, although this explanation is not accepted by modern evidence-based psychology. In the Christian West the attitude to those whose interest centred on gathering money has been coloured by the teachings of the Church. From its point of view, both the miser and the usurer were guilty of the cardinal sin of avarice and shared behaviours.Richard Newhauser, The Early History of Greed: The Sin of Avarice in Early Medieval Thought and Literature, Cambridge 2000, p.31 According to the parable of the Elm and the Vine in the quasi- Biblical Shepherd of Hermas, the rich and the poor should be in a relationship of mutual support. Those with wealth are in need of the prayers of the poor for their salvation and can only earn them by acts of charity. A typical late example of Christian doctrine on the subject is the Reverend Erskine Neale's The Riches that Bring No Sorrow (1852), a moralising work based on a succession of biographies contrasting philanthropists and misers. Running parallel has been a disposition, inherited from Classical times, to class miserly behaviour as a type of eccentricity. Accounts of misers were included in such 19th century works as G. H. Wilson's four-volume compendium of short biographies, The Eccentric Mirror (1807). Such books were put to comic use by Charles Dickens in Our Mutual Friend (serialised 1864/5), with its cutting analysis of Victorian capitalism. In the third section of that novel, Mr Boffin decides to cure his ward Bella Wilfer of her obsession with wealth and position by appearing to become a miser. Taking her with him on a round of the bookshops, In the following chapter, Mr Boffin brings a coachload of the books to his premises and readers are introduced to a selection of typical titles and to the names of several of the misers treated in them. Among the books appear James Caulfield's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons (1794-5);Various volumes appear in Google Books Kirby's Wonderful Museum of Remarkable Characters (1803); Henry Wilson's Wonderful Characters (1821); and F. Somner Merryweather's Lives and Anecdotes of Misers or The Passion of Avarice displayed in the parsimonious habits, unaccountable lives and remarkable deaths of the most notorious misers of all ages (1850). The majority of the misers are 18th century characters, with John Elwes and Daniel Dancer at their head. The first account of Elwes' life was Edward Topham's The Life of the Late John Elwes: Esquire (1790), which was initially published in his paper The World. The popularity of such accounts is attested by the seven editions printed in the book's first year and the many later reprintings under various titles. Biographies of Dancer followed soon after, at first in periodicals such as the Edinburgh Magazine\\"Anecdotes of the late Daniel Dancer Esq\\", 1794, pp.399-40 and the Sporting Magazine,\\"Anecdotes of the Late Daniel Dancer\\" 1795 then in the compendiums Biographical Curiosities (which also included Elwes) and The Strange and Unaccountable Life of Daniel Dancer, Esq. ... with singular anecdotes of the famous Jemmy Taylor, the Southwark usurer (1797), which was often to be reissued under various titles.Roy Bearden-White, How the Wind Sits; Or, The History of Henry and Ann Lemoine, Chapbook Writers and Publishers of the Late Eighteenth Century, Southern Illinois University 2007 pp.55-7 A pencil drawing of Daniel Dancer by Richard Cooper Jr, 1790s Jemmy Taylor's name also appears in the list of notable misers that Mr Boffin ennumerates. He is coupled with the banker Jemmy Wood of Gloucester, a more recent miser about whom Dickens later wrote an article in his magazine All The Year Round.April 10, 1869 pp.454-6 Others include John Little (who appears in Merryweather), Reverend Mr Jones of Blewbury (also in Merryweather) and Dick Jarrel, whose surname was really Jarrett and an account of whom appeared in the Annual Register for 1806. The many volumes of this publication also figured among Mr Boffin's purchases. Two more of the misers mentioned made their way into other literary works. John Hopkins, known as Vulture Hopkins, was the subject of a scornful couplet in the third of Alexander Pope's Moral Essays, \\"Of the Use of Riches\\": John Overs, with a slight change to his name, became the subject of a three-act drama by Douglas William Jerrold, John Overy or The Miser of Southwark Ferry (1828), roughly based on an incident when he feigned death to save expenses and was killed by accident.The Dramatic Magazine 1, 1829 pp.78-9 Another public source of information about misers, in Scotland at least, was the prose broadside. One example concerns Isobel Frazer or Frizzle, who died in Stirling on 26 May 1820. Much of the broadside is taken up with detailing the contents of her three rooms, into which she had let no one enter. Not more than ¬£8 in currency was discovered there, but she had bought and hoarded many articles of dress over the years, although rarely wearing them. She had also carefully picked up every pin that fell in her way, till she nearly filled one hundred pincushions. In addition to much other bric-a-brac, there were a great number of buttons, which had been cut off old coats. This makes her sound more like a compulsive hoarder than the \\"Female Miser\\" that she is called in the report. The title was more deserved by Joseph MacWilliam, who was found dead of a fire on 13 June 1826. A servant whose home was a damp Edinburgh cellar without either bed, chair or table, his colleagues and neighbours claimed to have seen him in the same threadbare clothes for 15 years. After his death, property to the value of more than ¬£3,000 was found in the cellar, some in the form of property deeds, and more in bank receipts. Later in the 19th century there were small regional publications dealing with single individuals of local interest. Examples of such works include Frances Blair's 32-page Memoir of Margery Jackson, the Carlisle miser and misanthrope (Carlisle 1847) and in the United States the 46-page Lochy Ostrom, the maiden miser of Poughkeepsie; or the love of a long lifetime. An authentic biography of Rachel Ostrom who recently died in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., aged ninety years, apparently very poor, but really wealthy (Philadelphia 1870). One trait of misers arising out of the accounts about them was their readiness to incur legal expenses where money was involved. Daniel Dancer was notorious for spending five shillings in an unsuccessful effort to recover three pence from a shop woman.Biographical Curiosities, (London 1797), pp.14-15 He was also involved in a lawsuit with his equally miserly brothers when his sister died intestate, although this time he was more successful.Biographical Curiosities (London 1797), p.6 In the same century, Margery Jackson was involved in an epic Chancery suit between 1776‚Äì91 over a family inheritance.Frances Blair, Memoir of Margery Jackson, pp.12-14 The American Hetty Green, who despite being a multimillionaire had also a reputation as a miser, involved herself in a six-year lawsuit to obtain her aunt's fortune, only to have it proved against her that she had forged the will.Notable American Women. (Harvard Univ 1971), vol.1, p.81 More modern times yield the Chinese example of an 80-year- old affronted by being called a miser in a poem by his son-in-law. Blaming his hospitalization with Parkinson's disease three years later on this, he sued his daughter for medical fees and 'spiritual compensation'.China Daily, 13 Feb 2009, \\"Daughter sued by dad over 'miser' poem\\" Misers in literature =Fables= There were two famous references to misers in ancient Greek sources. One was Aesop's fable of \\"The Miser and his Gold\\" which he had buried and came back to view every day. When his treasure was eventually stolen and he was lamenting his loss, he was consoled by a neighbour that he might as well bury a stone (or return to look at the hole) and it would serve the same purpose. The other was a two-line epigram in the Greek Anthology, once ascribed to Plato. In this a man, intending to hang himself, discovered hidden gold and left the rope behind him; on returning, the man who had hidden the gold hanged himself with the noose he found in its place.The Greek Anthology III, London 1917, pp.25-6 Both these stories were alluded to or retold in the following centuries, the most famous versions appearing in La Fontaine's Fables as L'avare qui a perdu son tr√©sor (IV.20)The Complete Fables of Jean de La Fontaine, translated by Norman Shapiro, University of Illinois 2007, p.101 and Le tr√©sor et les deux hommes (IX.15) respectively. Yet another of La Fontaine's fables was the late addition, \\"\\"The miser and the monkey\\" (XII.3), used as a cautionary tale for financiers. Here a man keeps his hoard in a sea- encircled tower until a pet monkey amuses itself one day in throwing the coins out of the window. In Asia misers were the butt of humorous folklore. One very early cautionary tale is the Illisa Jataka from the Buddhist scriptures. This includes two stories, in the first of which a rich miser is miraculously converted to generosity by a disciple of the Buddha; following this, the Buddha tells another story of a miser whose wealth is given away when the king of the gods impersonates him, and when he tries to intervene is threatened with what will happen if he does not change his ways.Tale 78, Sacred texts online Two 16th century stories concerning misers are included among the witticisms attributed to Birbal during Mughal times. In one he extracts from a casuistical miser a fee for a poem written in his praise.Anindya Roy, Akbar- Birbal Jokes, New Delhi 2005 \\"The Miser's Misery\\", pp. 125‚Äì6 In the other the miser is forced to reward a merchant who rescued his hoard from a fire with the whole of it.Clifford Sawhney, 50 Wittiest Tales Of Birbal, Bangalore 2005, \\"A question of 'like'\\", pp. 47‚Äì9 Arabs similarly made extensive use of misers in their literature. The most famous being the 600 page collection of anecdotes called Kitab Al Bukhala or Book of Misers by Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì. He lived in 800 CE during the Abbasid Caliphate in Basra, making this the earliest and largest known work on the subject in Arabic literature. When there was renewed European interest in Aesop during the early Renaissance, the Neo-Latin poet Laurentius Abstemius wrote two collections of original fables, among which appeared Avarus et poma marcescentia (The miser and the rotten apples, fable 179), published in 1499. This was eventually translated into English by Roger L'Estrange and published in his fable collection of 1692.Fable 458, p. 430 It concerns a miser who cannot bring himself to eat the apples in his orchard until they start to go rotten. His son invites in his playmates to pick the fruit but asks them not to eat the rotten ones since his father prefers those. The 18th century French fabulist Claris de Florian was to adapt the story in his \\"L'avare et son fils\\" (The miser and his son, IV.9). In this version the miserly father hoards his apples and only eats those going rotten. His son, upon being caught raiding them, excuses himself on the grounds that he was confining himself to eating just the sound ones.Fables de Florian, Paris 1846, p. 109 A print of John Gay's \\"The Miser and Plutus\\" by William Blake, 1793 In 18th century Britain, when there was a vogue for creating original fables in verse, a number featured misers. Anne Finch's \\"Tale of the Miser and the Poet\\" was included among others in her 1713 Miscellany. There an unsuccessful poet meets Mammon in the guise of a miser digging up his buried gold and debates with him whether the life of wit and learning is a better calling than the pursuit of wealth. Eventually the poet is convinced that keeping his talent hidden until it is better regarded is the more prudent course. It was followed by John Gay's \\"The Miser and Plutus\\", published in his collection of fables in 1737. A miser frightened for the security of his hoard denounces gold as the corruptor of virtue and is visited by the angry god of wealth, who asserts that not gold but the attitude towards it is what damages the personality. While these are more or less original interpretations of the theme, French fabulist Antoine Houdar de la Motte harks back to the light hearted approach of the Greek Anthology in \\"The Miser and Minos\\", first published in his fables of 1719.Fable XIX, Internet Archive Descending to the Classical underworld at his death, the miser is brought before the judge of the dead and is given the extreme punishment of returning to earth to witness how his wealth is now being spent. The Scottish poet Allan Ramsay adapted this into dialect two years later,Poems vol. 2 (1761) pp. 37‚Äì9 and Charles Denis provided a version in standard English in his Select Fables (1754), reversing the title to \\"Minos and the Miser\\".Fable XC p. 326 =Poetry= Misers are frequent figures of fun in the epigrams of the Greek Anthology.A group of eight in Book XI are numbered 165-73 It is charged of them that they are not masters of their own money if they do not spend it. Niarchus tells of one who does not commit suicide because of the cost of the rope to do so; Lucillius tells of another who dies because funeral expenses are cheaper than calling in a doctor. Elsewhere in the anthology is another epigram by Lucillius of a miser's encounter with a mouse that assures him he only wants lodging, not board.The Greek anthology for schools, poem 29 In one more, a miser dreams that he is in debt and hangs himself.Poems of the Orient p.323 The Latin writer Horace put miserly behaviour at the centre of the first poem in his first collection of satires, dealing with extremes of behaviour.Satires, Epistles and Ars Poetica, Loeb edition translated by H. Rushton Fairclough, London 1942 p.5 ff In writing an imitation of it, an English poet who provides only his surname, Minshull, was to emphasise this by titling his work The Miser, a Poem (London, 1735). In Dante Alighieris Inferno, misers are put in the fourth circle of hell, in company with spendthrifts as part of their mutual punishment. They roll weights representing their wealth, constantly colliding and quarreling. During the 16th century, emblem books began using an illustration of an ass eating thistles as symbol of miserly behaviour, often with an accompanying poem. They appeared in various European languages, among them the illustrated trencher by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, dating from about 1630, on which an ass laden with rich foods is shown cropping a thistle, surrounding which is the quatrain: In the third book of The Faerie Queene, Edmund Spenser created a portrait of a man trapped between conflicting desires in Malbecco, who appears in cantos 9-10. He is torn between his miserliness and love for his wife Hellenore. Wishing to escape with a lover, she sets fire to his storeroom and forces him to choose between them: Eventually losing both, he becomes the embodiment of frustrated jealousy. The 18th century, so culturally rich in miser lore, furnished some notable poetic examples. Allan Ramsay's ‚ÄúLast speech of a wretched miser‚Äù dates from 1728 and is written in modified Scots dialect. The miser bids farewell to his riches in a comic monologue and details some of his shifts to avoid expense.The Poems of Allan Ramsay, London 1800, pp.304-11 Alexander Pope created another masterly portrait in the character of Cotta in his Epistle to Bathurst (1733). Reluctance to spend confines this aristocrat to his ancestral hall, where he refuses to engage with the world.Moral Essays III, lines 177-196 Later in the century another Scottish poet, Dr William Stevenson (1719‚Äì83), included nine satirical epitaphs on misers among his collected works, of which the last begins: Poetic titles from the 19th century include the Irish Arthur Geoghegan's The Old Miser and Mammon: an Incident Poem (Newry 1818) and Frederick Featherstone's New Christmas Poem entitled The Miser's Christmas Eve (1893). There was also an anonymous didactic poem titled The Miser (London 1831). Although miserly behaviour is referenced during the course of its 78 pages, the real focus there is the attraction of money in all its manifestations. =Broadside ballads= The broadside ballad of \\"The Old Miser\\", early 19th century In the realm of popular poetry, there were a range of narrative broadside ballads concerning misers from the 17th century onward. Some of the earliest deal with the grain speculators who caused such suffering to the poorest. A representative example is \\"The Wretched Miser\\" (1682), prefaced as \\"a brief Account of a covetous Farmer, who bringing a Load of Corn to Market, swore the Devil should have it before he would take the honest Market price\\". The devil closes with the bargain and on accounting day carries off the farmer as well.University of California The social message is carried by the refrain that follows each stanza: \\"O Farmers, covetous Farmers,/ why would you pinch the Poor?\\" The religious aspect is dealt with in the contemporary \\"A Looking- glass for a covetous Miser\\" by Thomas Jordan. Here a West Country entrepreneur and a poor husbandman debate the respective merits of anxious profit-making and contentment. The miser laments the current low price of grain and resolves not to sell or plant more until the price rises.English Broadside Ballad Archive The theme continued into the early 19th century, where a farmer is again the subject of \\"The life and awful death of a rich miser \\".James G. Hepburn, A Book of Scattered Leaves: Poetry of Poverty in Broadside Ballads Bucknell University 2000 p.201 Another common subject of these ballads was the dilemma of the miser's daughter unable to marry the man of her choice and the stratagems employed to overcome her father. In \\"Bite Upon the Miser\\", printed in the late 18th century, a sailor dresses up as the devil and scares the miser and the parson he intended as her husband into allowing the match. Much the same situation occurs in \\"The Politic Lovers or the Windsor Miser Outwitted\\", where it is a butcher who impersonates the devil and scares the miser into handing over his riches. In about 1800 there appeared an English broadside ballad called ‚ÄúThe old miser‚Äù which was to serve as basis for what grew into a folk song with multiple versions. The scene is set in London, where a miser's daughter is courted by a sailor and the father arranges for him to be press-ganged to get him out of the way. As well as persisting in England, there are also versions in the US and Tristan de Cunha.Folk Songs of the Catskills, State University of New York, 1982, pp.187-9 Misers were notorious tricksters, so ingenuity transcending barely credible impersonations was generally needed. \\"Bite upon bite or the miser outwitted by the country lass\\" (1736‚Äì63) does not feature the miser's daughter but another sort of damsel in distress. A girl bears a child out of wedlock and is advised by her mother to name it Maidenhead and offer it for sale. A rich miser closes the bargain and is eventually forced to support the child by the magistrate.Scarlet Bowen, The Politics of Custom in Eighteenth-Century British Fiction, London 2010 footnote on p.185 Still another ballad theme was the privations of the miser's servant, a comic situation in drama and fiction also, and here principally concerned with how little food the household has to live on. One example is \\"The Miser's Man (dating from between 1863-85). At the start of the 19th century, the theme had figured as an episode in Robert Anderson's \\"Croglin Watty\\". A simple-minded countryman down from the fells, Watty was hired by the real-life Carlisle miser Margery Jackson (1722‚Äì1812) and served her for a quarter. The ballad mixes sung verses with prose description, both in Cumberland dialect: Dame Margery is not named in the poem because at the time of writing (1805) she was still alive and known to be litigious. We know that it is meant to be her from the fact that in William Brown's painting of the ballad, \\"Hiring Croglin Watty at Carlisle Cross\\", it is she who figures in the foreground. About 1811, just before her death, Brown had already devoted another painting to her alone as she tramped through the town. That she is still amusedly remembered there is witnessed by the modern Miser! The Musical (2011), based on her life. =Drama= Misers were represented onstage as comic figures from Classical times. One of the earliest appears in the comic Phlyax plays developed in the Greek colonies in Italy during the 4th century BCE, which are known only from rare fragments and titles. They were also popularly represented on Greek vases, often with the names of the characters written above them. In one of these by Asteas two men are depicted robbing a miser. At the centre the miser Charinos has settled for sleep on top of his strongbox in the comfort of two blankets. He is rudely awoken by two rascals mishandling him in an effort to lay their hands on his riches. On the left, Gymnilos has already pulled away the blanket on top of him while, on the right, Kosios drags out the blanket beneath. On the far right, the miser's slave Karion stands with outstretched arms and knocking knees.Klaus Neiiendam, The Art of Acting in Antiquity, Museum Tusculanum Press, 1992, pp.25-7 Such stock figures eventually provided inspiration for the Latin dramas of Plautus.Sean McGrath, South Italian Phylax Plays, University of Arizona The character of Euclio in his Aulularia was to be particularly influential, as was the complicating subplot of a marriageable daughter.Translated into blank verse in the 18th century by Bonnell Thornton, available on Google Books One of the earliest Renaissance writers to adapt the play was the Croatian Marin Dr≈æiƒá in about 1555, whose Skup (The Miser) is set in Dubrovnik. Ben Jonson adapted elements from Plautus for his early comedy The Case is Altered (c. 1597).The text is online The miser there is the Milanese Jaques de Prie, who has a (supposed) daughter, Rachel. Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft and Samuel Coster followed with their very popular Dutch comedy Warenar (1617). The play is named from the miser, whose daughter is Claartje. Moli√®re adapted Plautus' play into French as L'Avare (The Miser, 1668) while in England Thomas Shadwell adapted Moli√®re's work in 1672Albert S. Borgman, Thomas Shadwell, his life and comedies, New York 1969, pp.141-7 and a version based on both Plautus and Moli√®re was produced by Henry Fielding in 1732. Among later adaptations there was Vasily Pashkevich's 18th-century Russian comic opera The Miser and pioneering dramatic works in Arabic by Marun al-Naqqash (1817‚Äì55) M.M.Badawi, \\"Arabic drama: early developments\\" in Modern Arabic Literature, Cambridge 1992, pp.331-2 and in Serbian by Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá. Aubrey Beardsley's 1898 title page for Ben Jonson's play Volpone There were also independent dramatic depictions of misers, some of them being variations of the Pantaleone figure in 16th-century Italian commedia dell‚Äôarte. He is represented as a rich and miserly Venetian merchant, later to become the father of Columbina.The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre,Pantaloon entry, p.374 The Venetian characters who reappear in English drama include the Jewish moneylender Shylock in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice (1598) and the title character of Ben Jonson's Volpone (1606). In Aubrey Beardsley's title page for the latter, Volpone is shown worshiping his possessions, in illustration of the lines from the play, \\"Dear Saint, / Riches, the dumb god that giv'st all men tongues.\\"Wikimedia A similar scene takes place in the second act of Alexander Pushkin's short tragedy Skupoi rytsar (1836). This concerns a son, Albert, kept short of funds by his father, the Baron. Under the title The Miserly Knight, it was made an opera by Sergei Rachmaninoff in 1906.There is a complete performance on YouTube In the corresponding act in the latter, the Baron visits his underground storehouse, where he gloats at a new addition to his coffers and moodily contemplates the extravagance of his son during a 15-minute solo. Following on from the continuing success of Moli√®re's L'Avare, there was a spate of French plays dealing with misers and their matrimonial plans over the next century and a half. What complicates matters is that several of these had the same title but were in fact separate plays written by different authors. L'Avare Amoureux (The Miser in Love) by Jean du Mas d' Aigueberre (1692‚Äì1755) was a one-act comedy acted in Paris in 1729. It is not the same as the anonymous one-act comedy of the same title published in 1777. Another set of plays borrows a title from the Italian dramatist Carlo Goldoni, who was working in France at the end of his life. He had already produced a one-act comedy titled L'avaro (The Miser) in Bologna in 1756. In 1776 he produced in France the five-act L' avare fastueux (The Spendthrift Miser).Edward Copping, Alfieri and Goldoni: Their Lives and Adventures, London 1857, p.259 The same title was used by L. Reynier for his five-act verse drama of 1794 and by Claude Baron Godart d'Aucourt de Saint Just (1769-1826) for his three-act verse drama of 1805. The early 19th century saw misers become the subject of the musicals then fashionable in France. Eug√®ne Scribe and Germain Delavigne collaborated on L'avare en goguette (The miser's spree) in 1823, while Jean-Fran√ßois Bayard and Paul Duport collaborated on the two-act La fille de l'avare (The Miser's Daughter) in 1835. The latter play was freely adapted in 1835 by John G. Millingen under the title of The Miser‚Äôs Daughter. Two further adaptations of the French play were to follow later: Love and Avarice (1859) by J. V. Bridgeman (1819-89), and John Palgrave Simpson's Daddy Hardacre in 1857. Meanwhile, William Harrison Ainsworth's period novel The Miser's Daughter (first serialised in 1842) was spawning a fresh crop of dramas of that title. Two were played in 1842 and a further adaptation called Hilda in 1872. A similarly titled play was the five-act comedy partially in verse, The Miser's Daughter or The Lover's Curse of 1839, a schoolboy indiscretion of the future controversial churchman, Rev.John Purchas.New Monthly Magazine 1839 p.583 And on the other side of the Atlantic there was a stage production of Julietta Gordini:The Miser's Daughter, a verse play in five acts, which claimed to derive its plot 'from an Italian story'. Douglas William Jerrold's John Overy or The Miser of Southwark Ferry, (1828) also brings in a daughter whom the miser attempts to sell off as a mistress to her disguised lover.The Dramatic Magazine 1, 1829 p.79 Earlier Jerrold had written a one-act farce, The Smoked Miser or The Benefit of Hanging (1823), in which a miser tries to marry off his ward to advantage.Text at Victorian Plays project Another farce produced in Canada, Major John Richardson's The Miser Outwitted (1841), had an Irish theme and dealt with a plot to trick a miser out of his money.Theatre Research in Canada, Spring 1986 The later Thomas Peckett Prest's The Miser of Shoreditch or the Curse of Avarice (1854) was based on a penny dreadful story by him; later he adapted it as a two-act romantic drama set in time of Henry VIII.Victorian Plays project The popularity of these theatrical misers is evident from the number of paintings and drawings based on them, many of which were then adapted as prints. In 18th-century England, it was Fielding's \\"The Miser\\" that attracted most attention. Samuel Wale's drawing of the second act was also made into a print. But it was principally depictions of various actors in the character of Lovegold, the play's anti-hero, which attracted artists. Samuel De Wilde pictured William Farren in the role at the Theatre Royal, Bath. Several other works became plates in one or another book dedicated to English drama. James Roberts II (1753 ‚Äì c. 1810) executed a pen and ink watercolour of Edward Shuter in character which was adapted as a print for the six-volume play collection, Bell's British Theatre. Charles Reuben Ryley made a print of Thomas Ryder in the role for Lowndes' British Theatre (1788), while Thomas Parkinson's painting of Richard Yates as Lovegold was adapted for the 1776 edition of that work. In the following century, Thomas Charles Wageman's dramatic head and shoulders drawing of William Farren as Lovegold illustrated William Oxberry's collection of texts, The New English Drama (1820). From this time too dates the coloured print of Samuel Vale acting the part of Goliah Spiderlimb, the comic servant in Jerrold's The Smoked Miser. Moli√®re's L'Avare was not altogether eclipsed in England by the work adapted from it. A drawing by William Hogarth of the play's denouement was included as a print in the translation of Moli√®re's workP.J.De Voogd, Henry Fielding and William Hogarth, Amsterdam NL 1981, pp.38-9 and prints based upon it were made by various other engravers. William Powell Frith devoted one of his theatrical paintings to a scene from L'Avare in 1876 while the French actor Grandmesnil in the role of Harpagon was painted by Jean- Baptiste Fran√ßois Desoria. In addition, the challenging and complex part of Shylock was favoured by English artists. Johann Zoffany painted Charles Macklin in the role that had brought him fame at the Covent Garden Theatre (1767‚Äì68) and Thomas Gray portrayed a confrontation between Shylock and his daughter Jessica (1868).Wikimedia Character portraits of other actors in Shylock's role have included Henry Urwick (1859‚Äì1931) by Walter Chamberlain Urwick (1864-1943), Herbert Beerbohm Tree by Charles Buchel and Arthur Bourchier, also by Buchel. =Fiction= Characterisation of misers has been a frequent focus in prose fiction: George Cruickshank's 1842 illustration for Ainsworth's The Miser's Daughter * The miserly priest who was Lazarillo de Tormes' second master in the Spanish picaresque novel published in 1554.The Universal Anthology vol.12, 1899, pp.94-103 * Yan Jiansheng in an episode of Rulin waishi [The Unofficial History of the Scholars] by Wu Jingzi (Âê≥Êï¨Ê¢ì), written about 1750.

This French-Canadian novel was translated into English as \\"The Woman and the Miser\\" in 1978. Set at the end of the 19th century, the novel broke with the convention of extolling rural life and depicts a miser who mistreats his wife and lets her die because calling in a doctor would cost money. There have been adaptations for stage, radio, TV and two films, of which the most recent was S√©raphin: un homme et son p√©ch√© (2002), titled S√©raphin: Heart of Stone in the English-language version. There were beside many other prolific and once popular novelists who addressed themselves to the subject of miserliness. For the most part theirs were genre works catering to readers in the circulating libraries of the 19th century. Among them was the gothic novel The miser and his family (1800) by Eliza Parsons and Catherine Hutton's The miser married (1813). The latter was an epistolary novel in which Charlotte Montgomery describes her own romantic affairs and in addition those of her mother, an unprincipled spendthrift who has just married the miser of the title. Another female novelist, Mary E. Bennett (1813‚Äì99), set her The Gipsy Bride or the Miser's Daughter (1841) in the 16th century. Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Aurora Floyd (1863) was a successful sensation novel in which banknotes rather than gold are the object of desire and a motive for murder. It was dramatised the same year and later toured the US; in 1912 it was made a silent film. Later examples include Eliza Lynn Linton's Paston Carew, Millionaire and Miser (1886); Miser Farebrother (1888) by Benjamin Leopold Farjeon; and Dollikins and the Miser (1890) by the American Frances Eaton. In 1904 Jerome K. Jerome created Nicholas Snyders, The Miser of Zandam in a sentimental story of the occult in which the Dutch merchant persuades a generous young man to exchange souls with him. Misers in art Death and the Miser by Hieronymus Bosch in 1494 Mediaeval art works of Christian origin take a clear moral stance on the sin of avarice in its various manifestations. The frieze on the west wall of Lincoln Cathedral depicts the torments of Hell visited on those guilty of this sin,Wikimedia while Sassetta made \\"The Blessed Ranieri showing the friars the soul of the Miser of Citerna carried to hell by demons\\" a panel of an altarpiece (now in the Louvre). But the bracketing of the miser and the usurer as equally culpable types, mentioned earlier, makes it difficult to interpret the subject of later moralistic paintings, since they may represent either a hoarder, a money lender or even a tax collector. Such paintings cluster into recognisable genres, all of which point to the sinful nature of preoccupation with money for its own sake. Hieronymus Bosch's panel of Death and the Miser, dating from the 1490s, started a fashion in depicting this subject among Low Countries artists. Bosch shows the miser on his deathbed, with various demons crowding about his possessions, while an angel supports him and directs his attention to higher things. The link between finance and the diabolical is also drawn by another Fleming, Jan Matsys, in his portrayal of the man of affairs being assisted in his double bookkeeping by a demon. The same connection is made in \\"The devil and the usurer\\" in the Valenciennes Mus√©e des beaux-arts, formerly attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Younger, in which two devils pluck at the sleeve of a poorly dressed moneylender. The Gospel Parable of the Rich Fool lies behind another series of paintings which stem ultimately from mediaeval illustrations of the Dance of Death. There a skeleton compels those from all walks of life, but particularly types of the rich and the powerful, to join him in his dance to the grave. In 1538 Hans Holbein the Younger initiated a popular treatment of this subject in which each type is separately illustrated, of which there were many imitations in succeeding centuries. Among the depictions is a man starting up in protest behind a table piled with wealth on which a skeleton is laying hands. In his print of 1651, Wenceslas Hollar makes the connection with the parable clear by quoting from it in the frame.Wikimedia Commons A variation is provided by Jan Provoost's 16th century diptych in which death confronts the man of affairs with his own account. A century later, Frans Francken the Younger treats the theme twice, in both versions of which a skeleton serenades a luxuriously dressed greybeard sitting at a table. Another curious variation occurs in Pieter Quast's print of \\"The Miser and Death\\" (1643). Here the man sits at table clasping his money bags while contemplating a skull wearing a plumed hat, beside which is an hour-glass. The visitation of death is carried forward in the 19th century in similarly titled works. They include a portrayal by Franz H√§ussler (1845-1920) of an old man standing at his desk who peers round fearfully as he glimpses a skull reflected in a mirror. The charcoal and watercolour drawing by the Austrian Albert Plattner (1869‚Äì1919) is more ambiguous and has the figures facing away from each other in a cramped space. Yet another genre was the Allegory of Avarice, of which one of the earliest examples is Albrecht D√ºrer's painting of a naked old woman with a sack of coins (1507).Wikimedia Commons This makes the point that age comes to all and confiscates all consolations. A woman is chosen as subject because the Latin avaritia is of the feminine gender. Low Countries artists who took up the allegorical theme added the variation of making the woman examine a coin by the light of a candle or lantern, as in the paintings by Gerrit van Honthorst and Mathias Stomer. In his own allegorical treatment, Paulus Moreelse made the link with the dance of death genre by introducing a young boy slyly fingering the coins while keeping a wary eye on the woman to see if she has noticed. These Dutch variations were mostly painted during the 1620s, when Rembrandt too borrowed the imagery, but his candlelit examiner of a coin is male and the piece is variously titled \\"The Money Changer\\" or \\"The Rich Fool\\", in reference to the parable already mentioned.Wikimedia Commons Jan Steen, on the other hand, makes his subject very obviously a miser who hugs a small sack of coins and holds one up for intent inspection. In the Hieronymus Bosch Death and the Miser, the pull between spirituality and materialism is highlighted by making the deathbed a scene of conflict between the angel and demons. Quentin Matsys suggests the same polarity in his The moneylender and his wife (1514).Wikimedia Here the woman is studying a religious book while her husband is testing coins by weight. In the hands of the later Marinus van Reymerswaele the contrast disappears. The wife of his moneylender is shown helping with the bookkeeping and leaning sideways, as mesmerised as her husband by the pile of coins.Wikimedia Commons Gillis van Tilborch's painting of much the same scene is titled The Misers and again demonstrates the ambivalent targets of the moral message. The only difference is that the couple engaged in inspecting their money are old, as was the case in all the allegories of avarice. David Teniers the Younger depicted a couple similarly engaged in 1648 which was later engraved in France by Pierre- Fran√ßois Basan under the title Le plaisir des vieillards (the pleasures of old age). Verses as the bottom underline the moral: \\"Why do you make/ such piles of gold?/ Soon you‚Äôll grow old/ and Death takes all. Another area of ambivalence centres on the kind of clothes worn by the so-called misers. The subject of Hendrik Gerritsz Pot's painting from the 1640s in the Uffizi is fashionably dressed and wearing a ring. He may be inspired by the wealth and jewelry piled on his table, but he obviously has no objection to advertising his well-to-do status. On the other hand, the Miser Casting His Accounts presented by Jan Lievens is poorly dressed and his interest in hoarding is indicated by the way he gloats on the key that will lock his money away. The same dichotomy occurs in later centuries. Jean-Baptiste Le Prince's miser is also richly robed as he sits surrounded by his possessions, while Theodore Bernard Heuvel's miser sits on the chest containing his hoard and looks anxiously over his shoulder. Paul Gavarni's miser shows much the same apprehension as he leans on the table where his money is piled and glances round suspiciously. Old Gripus plundered by his young wife (1773) ¬© Trustees of the British Museum A sub-theme of this kind of contrast occurred in Hans Holbein the Younger's \\"The Miser and his Mistress\\". There a young woman in luxuriant Renaissance dress stands behind an ugly miser, reaching across him to take coins from the money bags he clutches to his chest, while he looks up at her, crying out with a grimace and trying to push away her hand. An updated version by Philip Dawe was published as a print in 1773 under the title of The Scramble, or Old Gripus plunder'd by his Young Wife. Underneath is a verse commentary: ::How hard is the conflict, yet claims ridicule, ::When doting and avarice possess an old fool! ::His wife while she plunders with smiles and caresses, ::At once cools his love and his avarice distresses. Literary manifestations of the theme of the mismatched couple include the Malbecco episode in \\"The Faerie Queene\\" and Catherine Hutton's novel \\"The Miser Married\\". English depictions of misers in the 18th century begin as genre paintings. Gainsborough Dupont's poorly dressed character clutches a bag of coin and looks up anxiously in the painting in the Ashmolean Museum. John Cranch (1751-1821) pictures two armed desperadoes breaking in on his. However, it is in the realm of satirical prints that the most inventiveness is found. James Gillray does not neglect the moral dimension either in his \\"The miser's feast\\" (1786). He is pictured seated at a table eating a meager meal, attended by Death in the guise of an emaciated and naked manservant holding in his right hand a tray with a bone on it and behind him, in his left hand, the dart of death. Famine, a withered hag naked to the waist, is also in attendance wearing a large hat and fashionable skirt. These characters are identified by the verse at the bottom: \\"What else can follow but destructive fate,/When Famine holds the cup and Death the plate?\\" Among other details in Gillray's crowded print is a fashionably dressed prostitute coming through the door. Lechery was supposed to be an attribute of some misers, exposing them to a contest between satisfying this weakness and their overmastering passion to save expense, as exemplified in the Old Gripus print. Thomas Rowlandson points to one solution of his dilemma in a print showing a miser engaged with two nude prostitutes whom has hired for the price of one. In another Rowlandson revisits the theme of the meager feast, depicting his miser crouched by an empty grate and keeping himself warm by hugging his money-bags. A hag enters, bringing a tiny portion to eat on a plate which a famished cat scrambles to reach. One more dichotomy explored by Rowlandson appears in his watercolour of \\"The spendthrift and the miser\\". The drunken young man alarming the miser there is probably his son, taking up a literary theme to be found, among other places, in Allan Ramsay's comic monologue. It will be remembered too that the thriftless ne'er-do-well of A Rake's Progress inherited his money from a miserly father. By the end of the 19th century the theme of the miser was distancing itself from the simply moralities of journeyman painters and becoming a subject for aristocratic amateurs. The Empress Maria Feodorovna's miser of 1890 handles a small strongbox.Wikimedia The Indian Raja Ravi Varma paints a Jewish character type for his miser, dated 1901, while the Hungarian nobleman Ladislav Med≈àansk√Ω titles his humanised study \\"Shylock\\" (1900). Apart from them, there is an etching by James Abbott McNeill Whistler which emphasises the essential isolation of such figures. His enigmatic \\"The Miser\\" of 1860 pictures an individual of indeterminate gender seated with its back to the viewer in the corner of a bare room next to the window. He is looking down as if examining something and the room behind him is spartanly furnished with just a table and bench, while a broadsheet is tacked to the wall.

He had a close artistic association with Francis Poulenc, with whom he performed in France and abroad. Poulenc wrote 90 songs for him during their 25-year musical partnership. Bernac was well known as a teacher; among the singers who studied with him were Elly Ameling, Grace Bumbry, Mattiwilda Dobbs, Carol Neblett, Jessye Norman and G√©rard Souzay. He gave masterclasses in France, Britain and the US. In retirement, Bernac wrote two highly regarded books about the interpretation of m√©lodies in general and Poulenc's in particular. Life and career =Early years= Bernac was born Pierre Louis Bertin in Paris on 12 January 1899, and started his working career in his father's brokerage house. He later changed his surname to Bernac to avoid confusion with the actor Pierre Bertin.Schmidt, p. 216 He began taking singing lessons at the age of 18, and was first taught by the composer Andr√© Caplet. He was later coached by Yvonne Gouvern√©, who accompanied him at his first recital, in Paris, in 1925.Blyth, Alan. \\"Bernac [Bertin, Pierre\\"], Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001.

They gave the first performance of Poulenc's Chansons gaillardes in 1926, but it was another eight years before they worked together again. In 1933 Bernac made the first of only two excursions into opera, as Pell√©as in P√©lleas et M√©lisande at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es. His only other operatic appearance was in the same role in Geneva, conducted by Ernest Ansermet in 1936. In 1934 Bernac, visiting the Salzburg Festival, was asked at short notice to give a Debussy recital. Having no accompanist and knowing that Poulenc was in Salzburg, Bernac sent him a three-line note: \\"I have been asked to sing some Debussy in three days' time. Would you agree to accompany me? Handsome fee, give me your reply quickly\\".O'Connor, Patrick. \\"Pierre Bernac\\", Gramophone, June 1999.

They continued to perform together for 25 years, in France and abroad, until Bernac retired. They built up a repertory, based on Poulenc's own songs, but also exploring the works of other prominent French songwriters from the 17th to the 20th centuries,Schmidt, pp. 488‚Äì491 and including songs by Brahms, Mompou, Schubert, Schumann, Verdi and others.Schmidt, pp. 266; \\"Recitals of the Week\\", The Times, 28 February 1949, p. 7 and 20 November 1950, p. 2 They began performing outside France quite soon after launching their partnership: in November 1935 they performed at the French embassy in London at a reception for the Duke and Duchess of York,\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, 21 November 1935, p. 17 the following year they broadcast the first of many recitals together on the BBC,\\"Broadcasting\\", The Times, 1 December 1936, p. 29 and their first British tour, in 1939, took in four cities in addition to London.Schmidt, p. 488 The Second World War delayed their American debut until 1948; The New York Times said of Bernac, \\"the integrity and elegance of his singing quickly won him a following among connoisseurs of art song interpretation\\".Hughes, Allen. \\"Pierre Bernac, 80, Baritone and Poulenc Partner, Dies\\", The New York Times, 19 October 1979.

Although Bernac avoided the operatic stage after 1936, Poulenc relied on him for technical advice on vocal matters when writing his opera Dialogues des Carm√©lites, and his late Gloria. Poulenc said that his association with Bernac was the reason why he wrote so many songs. \\"No one will ever sing them better than Bernac, who knows the inner secrets of my music. It was also through accompanying him in Schubert, Schumann, Faur√©, Debussy and Ravel that I learnt my trade as a melodist.\\"Poulenc, p. 224 Other composers who wrote for Bernac include, from France, Andr√© Jolivet, Henri Sauguet and Jean Fran√ßaix; from Germany, Paul Hindemith; from England, Lennox Berkeley; and from the US, Samuel Barber.

Early life Barco was born in C√∫cuta in the Norte de Santander Department of Colombia to Jorge Enrique Barco Maldonado and Julieta Vargas Dur√°n. He studied Civil Engineering at the National University of Colombia and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from which he graduated in 1943. He entered politics in 1943 when he became a city council member for the Liberal Party in the town of Durania. He was then elected to the lower house of Congress, but went into exile to the US in 1950 because of violence between liberals and conservatives. His daughter, Carolina Barco Isakson (who would later become a Colombian politician herself) was born there. He obtained an M.A. in economics at MIT, where he took classes under Nobel prize winners Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson in 1952. In 1954 he obtained a PhD in economics from Boston University. Barco is the grandson of Colombian General Virgilio Barco M., who developed one of the country's largest oil concessions in 1905. Political career Barco returned to Colombia in 1954 to help negotiate the peace process which allowed the formation of the National Front between liberals and conservatives, which lasted two decades. He became a member of the Senate, the upper house of Congress in 1958, left to become the ambassador to Britain in 1961, and returned to Colombia in 1962. He served another term in the Senate until 1966, when he was elected mayor of Colombia's capital, Bogot√°. He served in that position until 1969, when he became a director of the World Bank until 1974. He then served as ambassador to the United States from 1977 until 1980. Presidency Barco was elected president of Colombia with 58% of the vote in 1986. He supported anti-poverty programs, renewed dialogue with leftist guerillas and fought drug traffickers. Though he was popular within the international community, he became less popular in Colombia because the drug traffickers became more violent after he started to move against them. His restrictive economic policies at first doomed the country. After two years of this, The Economic Openness program was initiated by his administration, which would open Colombian markets to the world and recharge the country's economy. He served one 4-year term. After the Presidency When he left the Presidency in 1990, he served as ambassador to Britain again until 1992. Barco was diagnosed with cancer and he died on May 20, 1997, in Bogot√° when he was 75. He is now buried in the Central Cemetery of Bogot√°.

He served as a representative in the Croatian Parliament, a post he was elected to at the 1992, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2007 elections. Biography =Early life= ƒêapiƒá was born in ƒåaprazlije, Livno municipality, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina). The ƒêapiƒá family had a history of supporting the old Croatian Party of Rights, and later the Usta≈°e regime. His father and uncles chose to go to West Germany on permanent work instead of living in Yugoslavia, but Anto, his mother and brother lived in Osijek since 1962. ƒêapiƒá considers Osijek to be his hometown. ƒêapiƒá lost his mother in a car crash when he was a teenager, so he had to do manual labour while studying law at Osijek University. ƒêapiƒá obtained a law degree in 1989. =Political career= In 1989, ƒêapiƒá first joined Franjo Tuƒëman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). He was one of the party's organizers in Osijek, but he was expelled after short time for using the \\"Za dom spremni\\" salute. In 1991, he joined the Croatian Party of Right (HSP), which was renewed year earlier. After the assassination of Ante Parad≈æik, he was named party's Vice President. ƒêapiƒá was also for short period of time a commander of paramilitary units called HOS (Hrvatske Obrambene Snage - Croatian Defence Forces), which were organized by Croatian Party of Right. Later the HOS was merged with the Croatian Army (in Croatia) and the Croatian Defense Council (in Bosnia). In 1992, ƒêapiƒá was elected to the Croatian Parliament. In 1993, he was named vice-president of HSP. Previous president Dobroslav Paraga claimed ƒêapiƒá was elected illegally, and he later formed the new party Croatian Party of Right 1861, which has failed at each parliamentary election since 1993. In the 1995 election, HSP won 4.8% of vote, but after a recount, 5.01% was claimed to be official result, which meant that HSP remained represented in Parliament. With war being over the party took more and more criticism for its neo-Usta≈°a views. However, HSP led by ƒêapiƒá maintained small but solid support among the voters. In 2000, this time in coalition with Croatian Christian Democratic Union (HKDU), HSP kept four Parliament seats. ƒêapiƒá led a presidential campaign the same year, finishing a distant fifth. Since then, he and his party endeavoured to change their perception among voters. HSP continues to oppose the existence of the Hague War Crimes Tribunal, to hold eurosceptic views and is socially very conservative. ƒêapiƒá likened the possible legal recognition of same-sex marriages to \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\". In June 2005, ƒêapiƒá became mayor of Osijek, but he lost this position in 2009. In late 2009, the HSP split yet again. A new party, Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starƒçeviƒá, with Ru≈æa Toma≈°iƒá as party leader was formed. The party's leadership accused ƒêapiƒá for the weakening of HSP's standing in the Sabor. ƒêapiƒá was replaced as the president of the party at the November 2009 convention by Daniel Srb. In December 2011 ƒêapiƒá announced his retirement from politics. In 2013, he briefly returned to active politics by announcing his intention to run for the mayor of Osijek again, but was expelled from the HSP shortly thereafter.https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/dapic-iskljucen-iz-hsp-a- nakon-intervjua-jutarnjem-bio-je-glavni-razlog-svada-sukoba-i-podjela/4042989/ He ran for president in 2019 but was eliminated in the first round, winning 4,001 or 0.21% of the vote, and finishing 10th out of 11 candidates.

A Western Ta√≠no group living in central Cuba during the 15th and 16th centuries, they had a dialect and culture distinct from the Classic Ta√≠no in the eastern part of the island, though much of the Ciboney territory was under the control of the eastern chiefs. Confusion in the historical sources led 20th-century scholars to apply the name \\"Ciboney\\" to the non-Ta√≠no Guanahatabey of western Cuba and various archaic cultures around the Caribbean, but this is deprecated. Ciboney was the region of Cuba inhabited by the Western Ta√≠no group. History At the time of Spanish colonization, the Ciboney were the most populous group in Cuba. They inhabited the central part of the island, between western Pinar del R√≠o Province and eastern Oriente Province.Granberry and Vescelius, p. 20, 23. Bartolom√© de las Casas, who lived among the Ciboney in the early 16th century, related that their dialect and culture was similar to that of the Lucayans of the present- day Bahamas.Granberry and Vescelius, p. 20. As such, scholars classify the Ciboney as a Western Ta√≠no group, associating them with the peoples of the Bahamas, Jamaica, and westernmost Hispaniola, while distinguishing them from the Classic Ta√≠no of eastern Cuba, most of Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.Granberry and Vescelius, p. 9, 21. In addition to the Classic Ta√≠no in eastern Cuba, the Ciboney shared the island with the Guanahatabey, an archaic people inhabiting western Pinar del R√≠o Province.Granberry and Vescelius, pp. 18‚Äì19. The Ciboney spoke a dialect of the Ta√≠no language conventionally known as Ciboney Ta√≠no; it was distinct from, but mutually intelligible with, Classic Ta√≠no.Granberry and Vescelius, p. 21. The Ciboney were the dominant population in Cuba until around 1450.Granberry and Vescelius, pp. 20‚Äì21. Las Casas states that unlike the highly organized Classic Ta√≠no to the east, the Ciboney had no integrated chiefdoms or wider political structure.Granberry and Vescelius, p. 9. In the mid-15th century, Classic Ta√≠no from Hispaniola began migrating into eastern Cuba, overcoming the native Ciboney. These \\"Cuban Ta√≠no\\" established chiefdoms concentrated in Oriente Province, though they established settlements as far west as Havana Province. However, the Cuban Ta√≠no never established an island-wide political structure as existed in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. Classic Ta√≠no migration from Hispaniola to Cuba increased after Spanish contact, with many Ta√≠no leaving to escape the Spanish incursion. Notably, Hispaniola Ta√≠no chief Hatuey fled to Cuba with most of his people; he remained there until the Spanish captured and executed him. Following the Spanish conquest of Cuba in 1511 under Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar, the population of all native groups declined precipitously until they had disappeared as distinct groups by the end of the century.Saunders, p. xvii. Confusion with the Guanahatabey In the 20th century, misreadings of the historical record led scholars to confuse the Ciboney with both a neighbouring group, the Guanahatabey, and with archaic-level populations around the Caribbean. Las Casas referred to both the Ciboney and the Guanahatabey, but he was clear they were different: the Guanahatabey were a primitive society of hunter-gatherers in western Cuba, and they spoke a separate language distinct from Ta√≠no. A confusion of the sources led archaeologists to use the term \\"Ciboney\\" for the aceramic (lacking pottery) archaeological sites found on various Caribbean islands. As many of these were found in the former Guanahatabey territory, the term became associated with the historical non-Ta√≠no Guanahatabey.Saunders, pp. 122‚Äì123.Rouse, pp. 20‚Äì21. Scholars recognized the error in the 1980s and have restored the name \\"Ciboney\\" to the Western Ta√≠no people of Cuba.Granberry and Vescelius, pp. 22‚Äì23.

Origin and history The Independent was founded in 1969 by students and alumni who felt the campus needed an alternative to The Harvard Crimson. The Crimson at the time reflected the left-wing turn of student organizations throughout the nation in the 1960s, and the founders of the Independent felt politically alienated from Crimson editors. As the decades passed, the weekly newspaper, released every Thursday and distributed both on the Internet and to Harvard College student dormitories, the format morphed to that of an alternative weekly rather than a standard newspaper, with illustrated covers and four main sections: News, Sports, Arts, and the Forum (Op-Ed) section. In addition, the Independent also has several themed issues each year, including the annual The Game issue for the Harvard-Yale game, the literary issue, and the Sex Issue, featuring the results of a campus-wide anonymous survey on sexual practices and opinions at Harvard.

Background Eric Radcliffe is believed to have had a huge part in the success of Yazoo (Yaz in the US). In March 1984 Radcliffe gave an interview to Electronics and Music Maker in which he mentioned how he got into the business: > When I was about fifteen the group I was in was booked into a four-track > studio to do some demos, and I got a taste for recording then. I got an Akai > reel-to-reel at home and I built a studio in the front room, with multi-core > cable running into my bedroom which acted as the control room... it > snowballed... eventually I was able to afford an eight-track Teac and it was > with that machine that I came up to London and set-up the studio here, which > I called Blackwing and it took off in earnest... And a snippet on his contribution to the Yazoo sound: > We often combine more than one [device] to create a sound. One particular > one that sticks in my memory is the snare-drum sound on Yazoo's \\"Don't Go\\", > I did that using the Lexicon 224 and 224x [reverbs] ganged together. We came > across that sound entirely by accident, but then again, in the final > analysis I think you discover almost everything by accident, just by > fiddling around. After Yazoo, Radcliffe and Yazoo-songwriter Vince Clarke continued to work together. As The Assembly they released the single \\"Never Never\\" with singer Feargal Sharkey in the autumn of 1983. Clarke and Radcliffe also founded the record company Reset Records, and released singles with Robert Marlow, Peter Hewson, Hardware and Absolute, until 1987 when the label shut down. Eric Radcliffe now lives in Gravesend in Kent, with his three daughters Kai, Fay and Mae. In the documentary video accompanying Yazoo's 25th anniversary release In Your Room, Eric Radcliffe delivers the following written message: > I count myself fortunate and privileged to have worked with such a talented > team.

Nc3 White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent. A book reviewer wrote in the New York Times in 1888 that \\"since Morphy only one new opening has been introduced, the 'Vienna'.\\"A New Chess Book, May 13, 1888, accessed 2008-11-12 The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4, but in modern play White often plays more (for example, by fianchettoing his king's bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black most often continues with 2...Nf6. The opening can also lead to the Frankenstein‚ÄìDracula Variation. Weaver W. Adams famously claimed that the Vienna Game led to a forced win for White.\\"Mr. Adams and his cronies may be linked to the radical right wing of chess. For all their faulty analysis, they must be given credit for introducing healthy controversy into the staid annals of opening theory. ... Weaver is not content with such halfway measures as equality. All or nothing ‚Äì right-wing logic, true to form.\\" Nick de Firmian concludes in the 15th edition of Modern Chess Openings, however, that the opening leads to with by both sides. Falkbeer Variation: 2...Nf6  White has three main options: 3.f4, 3.Bc4, and 3.g3. Note that 3.Nf3 transposes to the Petrov's Three Knights Game, which after 3...Nc6 leads to the Four Knights Game. =3.f4= At grandmaster level, the gambit move 3.f4 is considered too risky an opening.Keene, Raymond. The Times 1 June 2012 It is best met by 3...d5, striking back in the center. After 4.fxe5 Nxe4, 5.Qf3 is well met by 5...Nc6, with the point 6.Nxe4 Nd4. 5.d3 is also possible, but the normal continuation is 5.Nf3. White obtains open lines and attacking chances, but Black can usually hold the balance with correct play. However, lines other than 3...d5 give White at least an edge, making this a good choice for aggressive play at lower levels, where opponents are unlikely to know that 3...d5 is best. The gambit should not be accepted, since 3...exf4 4.e5 Qe7 5.Qe2 forces Black's knight to retreat with 5...Ng8, and after 6.Nf3, Black must be careful not to lose on the spot, for example after 6...d6? 7.Nd5!, when the dual ideas of Nxc7 and exd6 will win the game quickly. Retreating immediately with 4...Ng8 is better, but after 5.Nf3 with the idea of d4 followed by Bxf4, White has a nice game. Other lines for Black include 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.d3, when the threat of Bxc6 followed by taking on e5 induces 6...exf4 7.Bxf4, leaving White with a pleasant position; and also 3...Nc6? 4.fxe5! Nxe5 5.d4, when both 5...Nc6 and 5...Ng6 are met by 6.e5 with a winning advantage to White. Material is not as important as the attack in this position, so White should not be afraid to sacrifice. =3.Bc4= The move 3.Bc4 leads to a position which can also be reached from the Bishop's Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4). Black has several choices here; 3...Bc5 can transpose to the King's Gambit Declined after 4.d3 d6 5.f4 Nc6 6.Nf3; after 3...Nc6 4.d3, 4...Na5, 4...Bc5 or 4...d6 are all playable; 3...Bb4 4.f4 Nxe4 5.Qh5 0-0 leads to wild but probably equal play, according to de Firmian in MCO-15.de Firmian, pp. 119‚Äì20. Also possible is 3...Nxe4, when 4.Nxe4 d5, forking bishop and knight, is fine for Black.de Firmian, p. 115. The attractive-looking 4.Bxf7+ is weak; after 4...Kxf7 5.Nxe4 d5 (inferior is 5...Nc6 6.Qf3+, when Black cannot play 6...Kg8 because of 7.Ng5! Davids‚ÄìDiggle, London Banks League 1949, while 6...Ke8 leaves the king awkwardly placed in the center) 6.Qf3+ (6.Qh5+ g6 7.Qxe5 Bh6! wins for Black)Neishtadt, pp. 65‚Äì66. Kg8 7.Ng5 (hoping for 7...Qxg5?? 8.Qxd5+ and mate next move, Schottlaender‚ÄìEd. Lasker, simultaneous exhibition, Breslau c. 1902) Qd7!, with a large advantage for Black in view of his and pawn center.Neishtadt, p. 65. After 3...Nxe4, White usually continues instead 4.Qh5 (threatening Qxf7#) 4...Nd6 5.Bb3 when Black can either go for the relatively quiet waters of 5...Be7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nxe5 g6 8.Qe2 (or 8.Nxc6 dxc6 9.Qe5 0-0) Nd4 9.Qd3 Nxb3 10.axb3 Nf5 11.0-0 d6, which led to equality in Anand-Ivanchuk, Roquebrune 1992. or the complexities of 5...Nc6 6.Nb5 g6 7.Qf3 f5 8.Qd5 Qe7 9.Nxc7+ Kd8 10.Nxa8 b6, which the Irish correspondence chess player and theorist Tim Harding extravagantly dubbed \\"the Frankenstein‚ÄìDracula Variation\\". =Mieses Variation: 3.g3 = The move 3.g3, the Mieses Variation, is a quiet continuation in which White fianchettoes his king's bishop, a line played by Vasily Smyslov on a few occasions, most notably in a win over Lev Polugaevsky in the 1961 USSR Championship. That game continued 3...d5 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Be6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.0-0 Be7 8.Re1 Bf6 9.Ne4 0-0 10.d3 Be7 11.a3 Nb6 12.b4, resulting in a position which the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assesses as slightly better for White. The main line today, however, is considered to be 5...Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bd6 7.Nf3 0-0 8.0-0. A major alternative for Black is 3...Bc5 (3...Nc6 normally transposes into one of the other lines). =3.a3= In addition to these lines, the late American master Ariel Mengarini advocated the whimsical 3.a3, sometimes called Mengarini's Opening. It is not a serious try for advantage, but is essentially a useful waiting move that gives White an improved version of Black's position after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6. First, the \\"Reversed Ruy Lopez\\" with 3...Bb4 is ruled out. Second, after 3...d5, 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Qh5!? gives White an improved version of the Steinitz Variation of the Scotch Game, since Black can never play ...Nb4, an important idea for White in the mirror-image position. Third, after 3...Bc5, 4.Nf3 gives a reversed Two Knights Defense. Then the typical 4...Ng4 may be met by 5.d4 exd4 6.Na4, when 6...Bb4+, White's usual move in the mirror-image position, is impossible. After 4...Ng4, White may also play improved versions of the Ulvestad Variation (6.b4 in the above line) and Fritz Variation (6.Nd5 c6 7.b4), since when White plays b4 his pawn is protected, unlike in the mirror-image position. If Black plays more quietly with 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 Nc6, then 5.Nxe5! Nxe5 6.d4 gives White some advantage. The best line for Black may be 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 d5 5.exd5 0-0 (better than 5...e4 6.d4, when the normal 6...Bb4 is impossible), and if 6.Nxe5, 6...Re8 7.d4 Bxd4! 8.Qxd4 Nc6, as in the mirror-image line. Also possible is 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 d6, when Black stands well after 5.Bc4 Be6, while 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 gives White little or no advantage. Max Lange Defence: 2...Nc6  White again has three main options, 3.Bc4, 3.f4, and 3.g3. Note that 3.Nf3 transposes to the Three Knights Game, which after 3...Nf6 leads to the Four Knights Game. =Vienna Gambit: 3.f4 = Hamppe‚ÄìMuzio Gambit  The Hamppe‚ÄìMuzio Gambit (or Vienna Hamppe‚ÄìMuzio Gambit) is characterised by the moves: 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 exf4 4.Nf3 g5 5.Bc4 g4 6.0-0 gxf3 7.Qxf3 (see diagram). As with its close relative, the sharp Muzio Gambit, White sacrifices the knight on f3 in return for a powerful attack against the black king. It is named after Austrian theoretician Carl Hamppe and classified under ECO code C25. The Dubois Variation continues 7...Ne5 8.Qxf4 Qf6. 6.d4 is the Pierce Gambit. Steinitz Gambit The Steinitz Gambit, 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 exf4 4.d4, was a favorite of Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Champion. White allows Black to misplace White's king with 4...Qh4+ 5.Ke2 (see diagram), hoping to prove that White's pawn center and the exposed position of Black's queen are more significant factors. Unlike Steinitz, who famously opined that, \\"The King is a fighting piece!\\", few modern players are willing to expose their king this way. The Steinitz Gambit is thus rarely seen today. =Paulsen Variation: 3.g3 = Louis Paulsen played 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 five times in the Vienna 1873 chess tournament.Hooper & Whyld (1996), p. 293. Paulsen Variation. =3.Bc4= Most often, White plays 3.Bc4, when the solid 3...Nf6 transposes to the 2...Nf6 3.Bc4 Nc6 line. Weaker is 3.Bc4 Bc5, when 4.Qg4! is awkward to meet. 4...Kf8 and 4...g6 are thought the best moves, but neither is too appealing for Black. The natural 4...Qf6?? loses to 5.Nd5! Qxf2+ 6.Kd1, when White's king is in no real danger, and White has multiple threats: 7.Qxg7; 7.Nxc7+; and 7.Nh3 Qd4 8.d3 threatening to trap Black's queen with 9.c3.Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen writes that after 5.Nd5! \\"it's over, as detailed analysis reveals.\\" Larry Evans, Svetozar Gligoriƒá, Vlastimil Hort, Paul Keres, Bent Larsen, Tigran Petrosian, and Lajos Portisch (1974), How to Open a Chess Game, RHM Press, p. 172. . 2...Bc5 This is an offbeat but alternative, as played (for example) by former world champion Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca against Ilya Kan at Moscow 1936. Some possible moves are 3.Bc4, 3.Nf3, and 3.f4. With move 3.Bc4, ...Nf6 and ...Nc6 can be found above, or Black can play ...d6. White can continue with 3.Nf3, when 3...Nc6 (transposing to the Three Knights Game) 4.Nxe5! Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5 7.Bd3 leads to a large advantage for White.de Firmian, pp. 130‚Äì31. Stronger is 3...d6! Then 4.Na4 Nd7 5.d3 Ngf6 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.Nxc5 Nxc5 9.Ne1 Ne6 10.c3 d5 is about even. The main line runs 4.d4 exd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6.Bg5 (6.Be2 d5 7.e5 Ne4 8.0-0 Nxc3 leads to equality) h6 7.Bh4 0-0 8.Nb3 and now de Firmian in MCO-15 gives 8...Bb4 9.Bd3 Re8 10.0-0 Bxc3 11.bxc3 g5! 12.Bg3 Nxe4, when Black's \\"chances are at least equal\\". After 3.f4, ...d6 leads to the King's Gambit Declined.de Firmian, p. 120. Weak is 3.Qg4 Nf6! 4.Qxg7 Rg8 5.Qh6 Bxf2+ when Black had a large advantage in Tsikhelashvili‚ÄìKarpov, USSR 1968, since 6.Kxf2?? Ng4+ would win White's queen. Another offbeat possibility is 3.Na4, the Hamppe Variation,Hooper & Whyld (1996), p. 166. Hamppe Variation. when 3...Bxf2+! 4.Kxf2 Qh4+ 5.Ke3 Qxf4+ 6.Kd3 d5 leads to wild complications favouring black, as in the famous Immortal Draw game Hamppe‚ÄìMeitner, Vienna 1872.

The Aramaic original New Testament theory is the belief that the Christian New Testament was originally written in Aramaic. The New Testament in Aramaic languages exists in a number of versions: #the Vetus Syra (Old Syriac), a translation from Greek into early Classical Syriac, containing most‚Äîbut not all‚Äîof the text of the 4 Gospels, and represented in the Curetonian Gospels and the Sinaitic Palimpsest #the Christian Palestinian Aramaic Lectionary fragments represented in such manuscripts as Codex Climaci Rescriptus, Codex Sinaiticus Rescriptus, and later lectionary codices (Vatican sir. 19 [A]; St Catherine‚Äôs Monastery B, C, D) #the Classical Syriac Peshitta, a rendering in Aramaic of the Hebrew (and some Aramaic, e.g. in Daniel and Ezra) Old Testament, plus the New Testament purportedly in its original Aramaic, and still the standard in most Syriac churches #the Harklean, a strictly literal translation by Thomas of Harqel into Classical Syriac from Greek #the Assyrian Modern Version, a new translation into Assyrian Neo- Aramaic from the Greek published in 1997 and mainly in use among Protestants #and a number of other scattered versions in various dialects The official Assyrian Church of the East (known by some as the Nestorian Church) does not recognise the new \\"Assyrian Modern\\" edition, and traditionally considers the New Testament of the Peshitta to be the original New Testament, and Aramaic to be its original language. This view was popularised in the West by the Assyrian Church of the East scholar George Lamsa, but is not supported by the majority of scholars, either of the Peshitta or the Greek New Testament. Some have dissented from the popular view. Wrote James Holding in 1884, \\"But He [Christ], their True Shepherd, addressed them [His apostles] in their own common speech, and where His very words have come down to us, they need no translation in the Peshito. Let the reader just dismiss his Greek, until its claim to be the first apostolic Testament can be based on firmer ground than any which we can find put forward by its boldest supporters. One-sided learning they may exhibit, but, to us, it appears devoted to trying to prop up a shaky theory.\\" In connection with the gospel of John, Holding remarks, \\"It may be noticed that we write Syriac readings, and not renderings; and this we do advisedly, for we wish to avoid words which would lead the reader to think that we admit that his Syriac is only a version from Greek. We see proof ever augmenting that the Peshito is no translation, but an original production of the first writers, slightly revised perhaps, and enriched by, here and there, a note from the pen of inspired revisers, but in its main bulk, the work of those holy men whom Jesus told the Jews, in His last public discourse, would yet appear and make a final appeal to the nation before its overthrow.\\" In 1855, James Murdock quoted Yale College President Ezra Stiles as saying in his Inaugural Oration, \\"Kindred with this, [the Hebrew,] or rather a bath-kol, and daughter-voice, is the Syriac, in which the greater part of the New Testament (I believe) was originally written, and not merely translated, in the Apostolic age. ... The Syriac Testament, therefore, is of high authority; nay, with me, of the same authority as the Greek.\\" Murdock goes on to observe that, \\"Many have believed that Matthew's Gospel and the Epistle to the Hebrews, if not also some other books, were originally written in Hebrew or Jewish Aramaean,\\" and adds, \\"J.A. Bolten (in his German Translation of the Epistles, with Notes, Altona, 1800, 2 vols. 8vo.) maintains that nearly all the Epistles must have been first composed by the Apostles in Aramaean, their native tongue, and then committed by them to some of their Grecizing companions, (e.g. Titus, Timothy, Tertius, Sosthenes, &c.;,) by whom they were translated into Greek before their publication. And Bertholdt (Einleitung, ¬ß 46, vol. i. p. 148‚Äì154) accedes to, and defends, this opinion. And he thinks that, after due time for reflection, the learned world will generally come into it.\\" The traditional New Testament of the Peshitta has 22 books, lacking the Second Epistle of John, the Third Epistle of John, the Second Epistle of Peter, the Epistle of Jude and the Book of Revelation, which are books of the Antilegomena. Closure of the Church of the East's New Testament Canon occurred before the 'Western Five' books could be incorporated. Its Gospels text also lacks the verses known as Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53‚Äì8:11) and Luke 22:17‚Äì18, but does have the 'long ending of Mark.'The text of the New Testament: an introduction to the critical ... Page 194 Kurt Aland, Barbara Aland ‚Äì 1995 \\"It contains twenty-two New Testament books, lacking the shorter Catholic letters (2‚Äì3 John, 2 Peter, Jude) and Revelation (as well as the Pericope Adulterae [John 7:53‚Äì8:11[ and Luke 22:17‚Äì18).\\" (Interestingly, the Arabic Diatessaron similarly lacks the account of the woman caught in adultery, but similarly contains‚Äîalong with a Latin Diatessaron textual stream‚Äîthe 'long ending of Mark.') These missing books are present in the Western Peshitto, and were reconstructed by the Syriacist John Gwynn in 1893 and 1897 from alternative manuscripts, and included them in the United Bible Societies edition of 1905. The 1997 modern Aramaic New Testament has all 27 books. The Peshitta lacks an erroneous mention of 'Jeremiah' in Matthew 27:9, and lacks Greek mss.'s embarrassment of having Jesus liable to Gehenna fire (compare Mt 5:22 and Mt 23:17 in the Greek). The Peshitta's Matthew rendition of 'the Lord's prayer' has extensive rhyming, the Peshitta's Lucan rendition has two fewer instances of rhyming, while there does not appear to be rhyming in Greek and Hebrew versions of the prayer. The Peshitta has 'MrYa' which almost always stands for 'Master YHWH,' while the Greek mss. have simply 'kurios' i.e. lord, and nothing representing 'YHWH.' At several locations, the Peshitta speaks of pagans/heathens, while the Greek mss. lack such politically-incorrect terminology; in Acts, the Peshitta refers to a city by an archaic name that would have been virtually unknown after A.D. 70, suggesting composition before or shortly-after A.D. 70.Introduction, pages l‚Äìli: \\"In the names of places, the Peshito shows the same independence of the Greek. . . . . in Acts xxi. 7, the Gk. has, Ptolemais; the Syriac has, Acu. Mr. Jer. Jones, in his work on the Canon, 1798, contends that the use of the name Acu, for Ptolemais, is a decisive proof that the Peshito must have been made not far in time from A.D. 70, when Jerusalem was destroyed. (vol. i. p. 103. ) He says that the most ancient name of this place among the Israelites was Aco, or Acco, Judges i. 31; that this name was afterwards changed to Ptolemais; that some say it had its new name from Ptolemy Philadelphus, about 250 B.C. He says it is certain that the old name Aco, was antiquated and out of use in the time of the Romans, and that the use of the old name Acu, in the Peshito, can be accounted for in no other way, but by supposing that the persons for whom the version was made were more acquainted with it, than with the new name Ptolemais; that upon any other supposition it would have been absurd for him to have used Acu. He says, that until the destruction of Jerusalem, one may suppose that the Jews may have retained the old name Aco still, out of fondness for its antiquity; but, he says, \\"how they, or any other part of Syria, could, after the Roman conquest, call it by a name different from the Romans, seems to me impossible to conceive. . . To suppose, therefore, that this translation, in which we meet with this old name, instead of the new one, was made at any great distance of time after the destruction of Jerusalem, is to suppose the translator to have substituted an antiquated name known to but few, for a name well known to all\\" (pp. 104, 105.) Mr. Jones says that a similar proof that the Peshito cannot have been made much after A.D. 70, is found in the fact that the Peshito often calls the Gentiles, as the Jews were accustomed to do, profane persons, where the Greek calls them the nations, that is, the Gentiles. The Peshito calls them profane, in Matt. vi. 7; x. 5; xviii.17; Mark vii. 26; John vii. 35; Acts xviii.4, 17; 1 Cor. v. 1; x. 20, 27; xii. 2; 1 Pet. iv.3. The expression is used, therefore, throughout the Peshito. Mr. Jones says, that it shows that the writer was a Jew, for no other person would have called all the world profane; and that after the destruction of the temple, all Hebrew Christians must have seen that other nations were not to be reckoned unclean and profane in the Jewish sense, and that therefore this version must have been made either before, or soon after, A.D. 70.\\" (On Canon, Vol. i., pp. 106‚Äì110.) Greek original New Testament hypothesis Mainstream and modern scholars have generally had a strong agreement that the New Testament was written in Greek and that an Aramaic source text was used for portions of the New Testament, especially the gospels. They acknowledge that many individual sayings of Jesus as found in the Greek Gospels may be translations from an Aramaic source referred to as \\"Q\\", but hold that the Gospels' text in its current form was composed in Greek, and so were the other New Testament writings. Scholars of all stripes have acknowledged the presence of scattered Aramaic expressions, written phonetically and then translated, in the Greek New Testament. Although it was frequently suggested that Q was a written source, it could have been a collection of oral sayings, usually referred to as the \\"logia\\" (See Luke 1:2‚Äì3). In an 1887 book, John Hancock Pettingell reports doing an investigation wherein he discovered that, \\"The common impression that the entire New Testament was first written in Greek, and that all the copies we now have, in whatever tongue, are copies, or translations of the original manuscripts, when seriously examined, is found to have no certain foundation. And yet this has been taken almost universally for granted. It is probable, that this is true with respect to some, possibly a majority of these books. But it is more than probable, if not quite certain, that some portions of the New Testament, such as the Gospel of Matthew, the Epistles to the Hebrews, and others, which will hereafter be mentioned, were first written in the vernacular Syriac of the Jews, and were afterward translated into Greek; and that other portions, perhaps most of the books, were duplicated, at the time they were written, by their authors, or under their direction,‚Äîone copy being furnished to those who were familiar with the Greek, and another to those who knew only the Syriac.\\" An example of how mainstream scholars have dealt with Aramaic influences within an overall view of the Gospels' original Greek- language development may be found in Martin Hengel's recent synthesis of studies of the linguistic situation in Palestine during the time of Jesus and the Gospels: > Since non-literary, simple Greek knowledge or competency in multiple > languages was relatively widespread in Jewish Palestine including Galilee, > and a Greek-speaking community had already developed in Jerusalem shortly > after Easter, one can assume that this linguistic transformation [from \\"the > Aramaic native language of Jesus\\" to \\"the Greek Gospels\\"] began very early. > ...

Cambridge University Press. Pp. 89f. Aramaic original New Testament hypothesis Although physical evidence has yet to be found, J.S. Assemane in his Bibliotheca stated that a Syriac Gospel dated 78 A.D. was found in Mesopotamia. The marginal hypothesis that the New Testament text that was read by the Apostles would have preserved the life and sayings of Yeshua (as he spoke them in Aramaic ‚Äì the language of Jesus) in their own native tongue of Aramaic before it was translated for those not among them who spoke Greek is not held by the majority of scholars. The position of the Assyrian Church of the East is that the Syriac Peshitta (a Bible version which is written in a vernacular form of Aramaic), used in that church, is the original of the New Testament. For instance, the patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai declared in 1957: This view is to be distinguished from the view held by most historical critics, that the Greek New Testament (particularly the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Mark) may have had Aramaic source texts which are no longer extant. Syrian churches say that their history includes compilation of their canon (which lacked the 'Western Five') extremely early. Comments John Hancock Pettingell, \\"There is no question, but that scattered manuscripts of the several books of the New Testament, in Greek, were in existence very early, for the Fathers quote from them,‚Äîbut there is no evidence that any attempt was made to collect them into one code, or canon, till after the Second or Third Century. But it is certain, on the other hand, that the Syrian Churches had their canon long before this collection was made; tradition says, between the years 55 and 60, and that this was done by the Apostle Jude. This canon is known to have contained all the books now included in our New Testament, excepting the Apocalypse, and the brief Epistles of 2d Peter, 2d and 3d John, and Jude. This tradition is strongly corroborated by the fact that these closing portions of our present canon were not then written; and this is a good and sufficient reason why they were not included in the first collection. The abrupt closing of the Book of Acts‚Äîfor it was evidently written at about that time‚Äîthat it might be ready for inclusion in this collection, goes to confirm the tradition as to the date of this collection. The Apocalypse and the four short Epistles which were not in readiness to be included at that early date, were afterward received into the Syriac Canon, but not till the sixth century.\\" The most noteworthy advocate of the \\"Peshitta-original\\" hypothesis in the West was George Lamsa of the Aramaic Bible Center. A tiny minority of more recent scholars are backers of the Peshitta-original theory today, whereas the overwhelming majority of scholars consider the Peshitta New Testament to be a translation from a Greek original. For instance Sebastian Brock wrote: (Lamsa and Bauscher did not translate the Old Testament Peshitta's deuterocanonical books, but did translate the remainder of the Peshitta Old Testament, plus the New Testament. Gorgias Press has published translations of many Peshitta Old Testament books, and of the entire Peshitta New Testament.) E. Jan Wilson writes, \\"I believe firmly that both Matthew and Luke were derived from Aramaic originals.\\" ‚Äì xli of his The Old Syriac Gospels: Studies and Comparative Translations (vol. 1, Matthew and Mark) (2003), 381pp. Some advocates of the \\"Peshitta-original\\" theory also use the term \\"Aramaic primacy\\", though this is not used in academic sources, and appears to be a recent neologism, as is the phrase \\"Greek primacy\\", used to characterize the consensus view. The expression \\"Aramaic primacy\\" was used by L. I. Levine,Judaism and Hellenism in antiquity: conflict or confluence, 1998, p. 82 but only as a general expression used to denote the primacy of Aramaic over Hebrew and Greek in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period (i.e. roughly 200 BC ‚Äì 70 AD). The earliest appearance of the phrase in print appears to be in David Bauscher.The Original Aramaic Gospels in Plain English (2007), p.59. Charles Cutler Torrey, while teaching at Yale, wrote a series of books that presented detailed manuscripturial evidence supporting the Aramaic New Testament, starting with The Translations Made from the Original Aramaic Gospels, and including the widely known Our Translated Gospels. James Trimm presented evidence for an Aramaic New Testament in the preface to his The Hebrew Roots Version of the New Testament. Yoseph Viel presented evidence for a Hebrew origin to the books of Matthew and Hebrews, theorizing that they were translated from Hebrew to Aramaic to Greek in his book, The Hebrew Pages of the New Testament. Brief history George Lamsa's translation of the Peshitta New Testament from Syriac into English brought the claims for primacy of the Aramaic New Testament to the West. However, his translation is poorly regarded by most scholars in the field.] The Old Syriac Texts, the Sinai palimpsest and the Curetonian Gospels, have also influenced scholars concerning original Aramaic passages. Diatessaronic texts such as the Liege Dutch Harmony, the Pepysian Gospel Harmony, Codex Fuldensis, The Persian Harmony, The Arabic Diatessaron, and the Commentary on the Diatessaron by Ephrem the Syrian have provided recent insights into Aramaic origins. The Coptic Gospel of Thomas and the various versions of the medieval Hebrew Gospel of Matthew also have provided clues to Aramaic foundations in the New Testament especially the gospels. Many 19th Century scholars (H. Holtzmann, Wendt, J√ºlicher, Wernle, Soden, Wellhausen, Harnack, B. Weiss, Nicolardot, W. Allen, Montefiore, Plummer, and Stanton)Jacquier, Jacque Eug√®ne. \\"Gospel of St. Matthew.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. theorized that portions of the gospels, especially Matthew, were derived from an Aramaic source normally referred to as Q. =Argument using the Arabic Diatessaron for the old age of the Peshitta= Tatian died in A.D. 175. Reasoning and textual evidence suggest that Tatian started with the 4 Gospels in the Aramaic Peshitta, and interwove Gospel passages into one consolidated harmonized narrative to get his Diatesseron, in the process quoting three-fourths of the 4 Gospels. We presently lack Tatian's Diatessaron in its original Aramaic, but do have it in translation in Arabic, a language related to Aramaic. A large number of parallels exist between the Peshitta's 4 Gospels and what is in the 'Arabic Diatessaron.' Paul Younan says, \\"It makes perfect sense that a harmony of the Gospels would necessarily require that the distinct 4 Gospels actually existed prior to the harmony. This is common sense. It makes ever more sense that an Aramaic harmony of the Gospels, which Tatian's Diatesseron was, was woven together from the 4 distinct Aramaic Gospels. .... Since the Arabic translation by Ibn al-Tayyib is the only one we know for sure was made directly from the Aramaic, and since it reads like the Peshitta..., and since we know that a harmony necessitates a base of 4 distinct Gospels from which it must be drawn ‚Äì I submit that Tatian's Aramaic Diatesseron was a harmony of the distinct Gospels in Aramaic we currently find today in the canon of scripture we know as the Peshitta. Occam's Razor is a logical principle which states that one should not increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything. In other words, the simplest explanation is usually the best. The simplest explanation is that Tatian created a harmony of the Peshitta gospels. This harmony existed in Persia until at least the 11th century, when it was translated into Arabic. ....if we are to believe the textual evidence in the Arabic translation... the Peshitta Gospels were the base of the Diatesseron which history attributes to Tatian. And this places the Peshitta Gospels at or before 175 A.D.\\" The Arabic Diatessaron has been translated into English, Latin, French, and German.Latin: Tatiani Evangeliorum Harmoniae Arabice nunc primum ex duplici codice edidit et translatione latina; A. Ciasca (1888). French: Diatessaron De Tatien by Tatian; A. S. Marmardji (1935). German: Tatians Diatessaron aus dem Arabischen (1926).

Hogg (1897) =Argument from geographical details for the old age of the Peshitta= Advocates of the Aramaic being written first, and then translated into Greek, have pointed out the geographical details present in the Peshitta, but lacking in Greek mss.; those advocates ask what's the best explanation for the presence of those geographical details in the Peshitta, but lacking in Greek mss. Johann David Michaelis states: William Norton states: =Argument from bad Greek grammar in Revelation to it not being originally Greek= Torrey opines that Revelation was originally in Aramaic, and points to grammatical monstrosities therein as evidence that it was not originally written in Greek: =Historical criticism= An argument that at least one of the Greek books of the New Testament have been translated out of the Aramaic comes from a textual analysis of those attributed to the Apostle John. Their variation in writing style is so considerable, that it would preclude them having been written in Greek by the same author. St Dionysius of Alexandria lent support to this argument, when pointing out how John's style of writing differs so markedly between his Gospel and Revelation. He concluded that the sophisticated writer of the former could not have written the clumsy Greek of the latter. Thus, the only way for John to have been the author of Revelation is for it to have been penned by a translator. However, Dionysius himself left open the possibility that it was written in Greek \\"by a holy and inspired writer\\" other than John.Eusebius, The History of the Church. VII, 24:1‚Äì27 Some have argued that the Aramaic gospels are older than the Greek gospels, and that the Aramaic NT wasn't derived from the Greek NT. William Norton commented in 1889: Norton later adds (on p. xlvii): Norton mentions (on lix‚Äìlx) additional scholars who had high regard for the Aramaic, and gives a fuller exposition of Michaelis: =Response to Papias= Papias provides a very early source for the idea that the canonical Gospels were either based on some non-Greek written sources, or (in the case of Matthew) possibly \\"composed\\" in a non-Greek language. The relevant fragments of Papias' lost work An Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord (Logi≈çn kuriak≈çn exƒìgƒìsis, c. 110‚Äì140) are preserved in quotations by Eusebius. In one fragment, Papias cites an older source who says, \\"When Mark was the interpreter [hermƒìneutƒìs, possibly \\"translator\\"] of Peter, he wrote down accurately everything that he recalled of the Lord's words and deeds.\\" Papias' surviving comment about Matthew is more tantalizing, but equally cryptic: \\"And so Matthew composed [or collected] the sayings [or record] in the Hebrew tongue, and each one interpreted [hƒìrmƒìneusen, possibly \\"translated\\"] them to the best of his ability.\\"Eusebius, Historia ecclesiastica 3.39.15‚Äì16, as translated by Bart D. Ehrman, The Apostolic Fathers, Vol. II, Loeb Classical Library, 2003, p. 103. For the word translated \\"composed,\\" Ehrman prints sunetaxato in his facing-page Greek text, rather than the variant reading found in some manuscripts, sunegrapsato. But, whereas sunegrapsato definitely means \\"composed,\\" other scholars have taken the reading sunetaxato to mean \\"collected.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia offers a fuller discussion in the section of its article on the Gospel of St. Matthew entitled \\"Authenticity of the First Gospel,\\" and in the article on Papias. A similar claim comes out more clearly in a text by Irenaeus, but this testimony is later than (and may be based on) Papias. Even if they do imply non-Greek originals, these accounts have been doubted, in part with an argument that the literary quality of the Greek of these books indicates that the Greek would be the original. (However, even if a text has high-quality Greek, that doesn't necessarily mean that it was originally composed in Greek: Josephus wrote in Aramaic, and had native Greek speakers polish his material that had been translated into Greek. Also, Torrey has observed that the Greek for the 4 gospels and the first half of Acts isn't that great. The Greek for Revelation is atrocious in its quality.) This argument extends to the other books where the Church Fathers accepted Greek as the original without debate. The Greek New Testament's general agreement with the Septuagint is also counted as evidence by majority view scholars. Aramaic primacists point to quotations from the Hebrew (Masoretic) Old Testament in the Alexandrian text type that indicate at one point a non-Greek speaking audience was addressed (See Matthew 2:15, 2:18, 11:10; Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27; John 19:37; Acts 13:18; Romans 9:33, 11:35; 1 Corinthians 3:19; 1 Peter 2:8). Aramaic primacists question why the New Testament would quote from the Hebrew Old Testament and not from the Septuagint if it was written in Greek originally. Quotes from the Hebrew Old Testament are present in Alexandrian texts that are thought to predate Jerome's use of the Hebrew Old Testament for the Vulgate. =Response to specific verses= There are also alternative explanations for the cases where Aramaic primacists claim that the Aramaic seems to read better. One example is in the case of the \\"camel through the eye of a needle.\\" In Jewish and Christian literature we see the following: :\\"...who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle.\\" :‚ÄîBabylonian Talmud, Baba Mezi'a, 38b :\\"They do not show a man a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle.\\" :‚ÄîBabylonian Talmud, Berakoth, 55b :\\"13 There was a rich man named Onesiphorus who said: If I believe, shall I be able to do wonders? Andrew said: Yes, if you forsake your wife and all your possessions. He was angry and put his garment about Andrew's neck and began to beat him, saying: You are a wizard, why should I do so? 14 Peter saw it and told him to leave off. He said: I see you are wiser than he. What do you say? Peter said: I tell you this: it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\\" :‚ÄîApocryphal Acts of Peter and Andrew. Aramaic primacists, most notably Lamsa, generally respond that these sources are late compared to the account in Q, as the Mishnah, the base document of the Babylonian Talmud was compiled in 200, where the Acts of Peter and Andrew is a 3rd-century work and therefore the original mistranslation of ◊í◊û◊ú◊ê (gaml√¢) predates and is potentially the source of these subsequent paraphrases. The Aramaic word for camel can also mean \\"rope\\" thus saying \\"it easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle\\". Advocates of Aramaic primacy note that the best evidence of Aramaic being the original would be mistranslations in the Greek translation. Some grant that 'camel through the eye of a needle' is a more-striking metaphor than 'rope through the eye of a needle,' but go on to claim that accurate translations of the original Aramaic remove several mistranslations present in Greek manuscripts: *mistranslation at Mt 1:16 Greek manuscripts of Matthew's genealogy list 14, 14, and 13 generations. In Aramaic mss. of Matthew's genealogy, with Mt 1:16's \\"gbra\\" correctly translated as father/guardian, Matthew's genealogy lists 14, 14, and 14 generations. Mary had a father/guardian named Joseph (plus a husband also called Joseph). Native Aramaic speaker Paul Younan detected this mistranslation. *mistranslation at Mt 26:6 and Mk 14:3 Greek mss. have Jesus and his disciples visiting the house of a leper. The Greek translation from Aramaic has leper at Mt 26:6 and Mk 14:3, while the Aramaic allows for potter. Lepers were unclean and weren't allowed to have guests over. It's actually Simon the potter. To continue to call someone a leper even after he'd been healed of leprosy would have constituted slander. *mistranslations at Mt 7:6 For Mt 7:6, it's actually 'hang earrings on dogs,' not 'give a holy thing to dogs.' Native Aramaic speaker Paul Younan noticed the two mistranslations in this verse. *mistranslation at Mark 9:49 Mark 9:49 (HCSB) \\"For everyone will be salted with fire. [a: Other mss add and every sacrifice will be salted with salt]\\" The complete text was present as of A.D. 175. Arabic Diatessaron 25:23: \\"Every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.\\" The original Aramaic has the complete text; when translated well Mk 9:49 (based on Younan) reads: \\"For with fire everything will be *vaporized*, and with salt every sacrifice will be *seasoned*.\\" Vaporized and seasoned, the root MLKh can mean 'to salt, season' or 'to destroy, vaporize, scatter.' The intended meaning shifted between the first and second lines‚Äîthe Messiah plays on the dual meaning of MLKh. See Mk 9 PDF of Paul Younan at http://dukhrana.com *mistranslation at Lk 14:26 The Greek manuscripts have a mistranslation for Lk 14:26, which when translated well reads: \\"He who comes to me [Jesus] and does not *sena* [put aside; contextually improper here: hate, have an aversion to] his father and his mother and his brothers and his sisters and his wife and his children and even himself, is not able to be a talmida [student] to me.\\" *mistranslation at John 13:13 Jesus spoke in Aramaic what became John 13:13a. Greek mss. have Jesus say, \\"·ΩëŒºŒµ·øñœÇ œÜœâŒΩŒµ·øñœÑŒ≠ ŒºŒµ ·Ωâ Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ¨œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±ŒØ ·Ωâ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ\\" (W&H;, NA28 variants). \\"œÜœâŒΩŒµ·øñœÑŒ≠\\" ('to call out') was an incorrect word choice for the Greek rendition of his remark: \\"·ΩôŒºŒµ·øñœÇ œÜœâŒΩŒµ·øñœÑŒ≠ ŒºŒµ ·Ωâ Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ¨œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±ŒØ ·Ωâ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ [you call me, Teacher and Lord] is bad Greek, just about as astonishing as if one should say in English: \\"you cry me teacher and lord.\\" The right word, which John knew quite well, would have been Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒµ·øñœÑŒµ. Why did he ever write œÜœâŒΩŒµ·øñŒΩ?\\" *mistranslation for Acts 2:24 When translated well it reads: \\"But Allaha [God] loosed the cords of Sheol [the Grave/Death] and raised him [Yeshua/Jesus] because it was not possible that he be held in it, in Sheol.\\" The Greek versions mistranslated the word \\"cords\\" as 'pain.' (cf. Jn 2:15 & 2 Samuel 22:6) ‚ÄîPaul Younan *mistranslation for Acts 5:13 The Greek manuscripts have a mistranslation for Acts 5:13: \\"And there was a great fear in all the eidta [congregation], and in all those who heard. And many mighty deeds and signs occurred by the hands of the Shelikha [Apostles] among the people. And they were all assembled together in the Porch of Shlemon [Soloman]. 13. And of other men, not one dared to *touch* them, rather the people magnified them. The word translated by \\"touch\\" can mean \\"join/commune\\" but also \\"touch,\\" the latter undoubtedly being the correct reading. The Greek versions mistranslated this word as \\"join\\".‚ÄîPY *mistranslation for Acts 8:23 The Greek manuscripts have a mistranslation for Acts 8:23: \\"But repent of this your evil and beseech Allaha [God]. Perhaps you [Simon the sorcerer] will be forgiven the guile of your heart. 23. For I [Shimon Keepa/ Simon Peter] see that you are in bitter *anger* and in the bonds of iniquity.\\" The Aramaic word kabda can mean gall/liver/anger. The Greek versions mistranslate \\"bitter kabda\\" as \\"gall of bitterness\\" instead of the more contextually proper \\"bitter anger\\".‚ÄîPY *mistranslation for Acts 8:27 The Greek manuscripts have a mistranslation for Acts 8:27, which when translated well reads: \\"And he [Pileepos/ Philip] arose (and) went and met a certain *mahaymina* [believer] who had come from Cush, an official of Qandeq, the malkta [queen] of the Cushites, and he was an authority over all her treasures. And he had come to worship in Urishlim.\\" Re: MHYMNA, it can mean either 'believer' or 'eunuch'‚Äîor many similar things. The Greek versions mistranslate this as 'eunuch' instead of the more contextually correct 'believer'.‚ÄîPY. The Ethiopian believer was intending to worship in Jerusalem, presumably in the temple there‚Äîwhich eunuchs were prohibited from doing by Deut 23:2. Cf. Mt 19:12. *mistranslation at Rev 1:13 The mistranslation says Jesus has female breasts: Rev 1:13, Common English Bible: \\"In the middle of the lampstands I saw someone who looked like the Human One. He wore a robe that stretched down to his feet, and he had a gold sash around his chest.[aj]\\" The Greek word used here is mastos and is used exclusively for a woman's breasts. *mistranslation at Rev 2:22 The Greek mistranslation rendered a word as \\"bed,\\" thereby having an adulterous woman being thrown into a bed. (It should have used \\"bier.\\"). The KJV translators translated Rev 2:21‚Äì22: \\"And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.\\" The NASB added \\"of sickness\\" in italics, thereby indicating to the reader that they had added it beyond what the Greek has: \\"I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality. Behold, I will throw her on a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds.\\" It would make more sense if she'd been said to have been thrown onto a mortuary couch i.e. a bier‚Äîand doing such is possible translating from the Aramaic Revelation. *mistranslation at Rev 10:1 The mistranslation says \\"feet\\" were like 'columns/pillars of fire,' while the Aramaic better allows for the correct rendition, \\"legs like columns/pillars of fire.\\" Revelation 10:1 (KJV) And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet [Greek: podes/œÄœåŒ¥ŒµœÇ/feet] as pillars of fire: * mistranslations at Mt 5:13 and Lk 14:34 (but not at Mk 9:50) Matthew 5:13 and Luke 14:34 in Greek mss. have an erroneous translation of the original Aramaic th-p-k-h by rendering it as ŒºœâœÅŒ±ŒΩŒ∏·øá/ foolish. In contrast, Mark 9:50 in Greek mss. correctly render Jesus' remarks about salt that becomes ·ºÑŒΩŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ/ unsalty.

A portion of the songs are Eurobeat remixes of other Bemani tracks such as CAN'T STOP FALLIN' IN LOVE. There are also two songs that are J-EURO remixes, remixes of J-pop songs (Aishiattemasu and Deluxe, both by Key-A-Kiss). Korean version A Korean version of ParaParaParadise, called ParaParaDancing was also released. The songlist was changed to feature more Korean music, including a song by S.E.S.. Songs by Korean artists, H.O.T. \\"Hold On Me\\", sung in Korean, was originally in Japanese. ParaParaDancing also features the ability to play on the reverse side of the stage by setting the machine to sense on the rear 5 out of the total 8 sensors, facing the spectators instead. Emulation and simulation The developers of MAME have been working on a way to emulate the arcade machine on a computer. Since then, 14 other FireBeat games have been dumped, although they still remain marked as not working in MAME. The open-source music game StepMania also has support for ParaParaParadise, and CVS versions of version 4.0 support the PS2 version's controller, although actual simfiles for the game are few. Reception On release, Famitsu magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 31 out of 40.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥2 - „Éë„É©„Éë„É©„Éë„É©„ÉÄ„Ç§„Çπ. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2.

It is southwest of Kodiak. The Three Saints Bay Site is an archaeological site, the location of the first Russian settlement in Alaska, Three Saints Harbor (, Gavan‚Äô Tryokh Svyatitelyej). The settlement was founded in 1784 by Grigory Shelikhov.Brown, S.R., 2009, Merchant Kings, New York: St. Martin's Press, The main settlement was moved in 1792 to Pavlovskaya Gavan (–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–∞–≤–∞–Ω—å ‚Äì Paul's HarborU.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Kodiak), now known as the city of Kodiak.Khlebnikov, K.T., 1973, Baranov, Chief Manager of the Russian Colonies in America, Kingston: The Limestone Press, The Three Saints Bay Site was declared a National Historic Landmark by the United States in 1978.  History  Although Russian fur hunters had established temporary shore stations in Alaska earlier, they intended the Three Saints site to be a permanent colonial settlement. The site was poorly chosen, for the hillside above the shore area was too steep to build on, and the shore area was too small for a substantial settlement. When it was visited in 1790, it was described as a cluster of small structures (probably barabaras), with a population of about fifty men and a small number of women. The site was harmed by subsidence and a probable tsunami in the wake of a 1788 earthquake. In 1791, Alexander Baranov began moving the main Russian settlement to the site of present-day Kodiak. This original Russian site continued to be occupied as a smaller station of lesser importance until roughly the mid-19th century, at which time it was relocated to a site about away. Only a few remnants of the Russian occupation remain on the surface. These are mainly pits and rectangular depressions, indications of where structures were located, and some plants that are evidence of the small-scale agriculture which was practiced there. The settlement's cemetery was located to its southeast. Excavation at the site yielded evidence that it was built on the site of an older native settlement, dating to c. 100 BCE. The Russian settlement site was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978.  Etymology  The bay was named for the harbor, in turn named after one of Shelikhov's ships. It was named for the Three Holy Hierarchs. It was reported by Petroff in the 10th Census in 1880.Petroff, 1893, p. 32. The same area was later called Lyakhik Bay (Zaliv Lyakhik) by Captain Tebenkov.1852, map 23. This was based on its Aleut name Liakik,Baker, 1906, p. 625. probably from liak (\\"black-footed goose\\").Geoghegan, R.H. Notes. He proposes it as a dual form, meaning \\"pair of geese\\".

The form first became popular in the underground comics movement and has since become more widespread. It is currently most popular in Canadian, American and French comics; all artists listed below are from the US unless otherwise specified. 1880s * Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro (1846‚Äì1905) \\"made an attempt of an autobiographical comics exercise\\"Marcos Farrajota, \\"Desassossego\\" (reprinting his article of introduction to Portuguese comics for ≈†! magazine) in his 1881 graphic reportage book No Lazareto de Lisboa (\\"The Lazaretto of Lisbon\\"), by including himself and personal thoughts.

Second-to-last cartoon refers to her widely-covered 1916 divorce from boxer Oscar \\"Battling\\" Nelson. * Fay King (1910s‚Äì1930s newspaper cartoonist) drew herself as a character later used as Olive Oyl in autobiographical strips portraying her reportages, opinions, and personal life. 1920s * Carlos Botelho (1899‚Äì1982) had a weekly comic page in a \\"style that mixed up chronicle, autobiography, journalism, and satire\\" running from 1928 to 1950 in the Portuguese magazine Sempre Fixe. 1930s * Henry (Yoshitaka) Kiyama's The Four Immigrants Manga (drawn 1924‚Äì1927, exhibited 1927 in San Francisco, self-published 1931). These 52 two-page strips drew from the experiences of Kiyama and three friends, mostly as Japanese student immigrants to San Francisco between 1904 and 1907, plus material up to 1924. 1940s * The artist Taro Yashima (born Atsushi Iwamatsu) published his autobiographical graphic works The New Sun in 1943 and The New Horizon in 1947 (both written in English). The first book describes his early life as well his as his wife Mitsu Yashima's imprisonment and brutalization by the Tokk≈ç (special higher police) in response to their antiwar, anti-Imperialist, and anti-militarist stance in the 1930s. The second book describes their post-prison life in Japan under militarist rule up until the time they emigrated to the United States in 1939. 1960s * Shinji Nagashima created \\"Mangaka Zankoku Monogatari\\" (Cruel Tale of a Cartoonist) in 1961. * Yoshiharu Tsuge (born 1937) published in 1966 his autobiographical story \\"Chiko\\"\\"‚ÄòChiko,‚Äô ‚ÄòA View of the Seaside,‚Äô and ‚ÄòMister Ben of the Igloo‚Äô: Visual and Verbal Narrative Technique in Three Classic Manga by Yoshiharu Tsuge\\", by Tom Gill, Hooded Utilitarian, June 9, 2014 (\\"Chiko, the Java sparrow\\"), depicting his daily life as a struggling manga artist living with a bar hostess making most of their money. Published in the seminal magazine Garo, it started the movement of Watakushi manga (\\"I manga\\", or \\"comics about me\\"). These short graphic nonfictions (including memoirs, chronicles, travel or dream diaries) were also represented by Yu Takita, Tadao Tsuge, and Shinichi Abe (see below). * Yu Takita (1932‚Äì1990) started in 1968 his Terajima-cho stories (\\"Terajima neighborhood mystery tales\\"). They were series of vignettes about 1930s life in this Tokyo district where his parents ran a tavern.Yu Takita at Lambiek Comiclopedia * Tadao Tsuge (born 1941) started in 1968 his personal stories, later collected in Trash Market. 1970s * Sam Glanzman started in April 1970 his U.S.S. Stevens autobio stories (1970‚Äì1977) about his war service, as 4-pagers in DC Comics's title Our Army at War. Beside memoirs of war actions he witnessed, many are personal vignettes of embarrassing moments, including as an artist. As comics historian John B. Cooke noted, those \\"autobiographical tales about the sometimes mundane, frequently horrifying experiences aboard a Fletcher-class U.S. navy destroyer during World War II were beginning to appear regularly, debuting two years before Binky Brown.\\"John B. Cooke, \\"Introduction: A Sailor's History, the Life and Art of Sam J. Glanzman\\", in U.S.S. Stevens: The Collected Stories (2016, Dover), p. xi. * Shinichi Abe (born 1950) started in 1971\\"Garo 88\\", Three Steps Over Japan, February 20, 2011. his autobiographical series Miyoko Asagaya kibun (\\"The Miyoko Asagaya feeling\\" or \\"Miyoko, Asagaya's feeling\\") for Garo magazine. It chronicled his 1970s bohemian life with his model girlfriend Miyoko in the Asagaya district of Tokyo. (The manga was adapted into the 2009 film Miyoko.) * Justin Green, though not the first author of autobio comics, is generally acknowledged to have pioneered the confessional genre in English-language comics, because of the immediate influence of his \\"highly personal autobiographical comics\\"Robert Crumb, on the backcover of Justin Green's Binky Brown Sampler, Last Gasp, 1995. on other creators (Kominski, Crumb, Spiegelman, Pekar, see below). This was done through the veiled autobio of his alter ego's \\"Binky Brown\\" stories, notably the March 1972 comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary, an extremely personal work dealing with Green's Catholic and Jewish background and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Binky Brown continued his adventures in \\"Sacred and Profane\\" with a story called Sweet Void of Youth. * In October 1972, Japanese manga artist Keiji Nakazawa created the 48-page story \\"I Saw It\\" (\\"Ore wa Mita\\"), which told of his firsthand experience of the bombing of Hiroshima. (This was followed by the longer, fictionalized work Barefoot Gen (Hadashi no Gen), later adapted into three films.) * Aline Kominsky followed Green in November 1972 with her veiled autobio 5-pager \\"Goldie, a Neurotic Woman\\"https://www.comics.org/issue/277001/ (in Wimmen's Comix #1). * Art Spiegelman followed Green in 1973 with his 4-page \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\"https://www.comics.org/issue/276083/ (in Short Order Comix #1), about his feelings after the suicide of his Holocaust-survivor mother (a strip later included in Maus, see below). * Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky released in 1974 Dirty Laundry Comics #1, a joint confessional comic book documenting their budding romance, though depicted aboard a fantasy spaceship. * In 1976, Harvey Pekar began his long-running self-published series American Splendor, which collected short stories written by Pekar, usually about his daily life as a file clerk, and illustrated by a variety of artists. The series led to Pekar meeting his wife Joyce Brabner, who later co-wrote their graphic novel Our Cancer Year about his brush with lymphoma. * In 1977, the Italian magazine Alter Alter starts publishing Andrea Pazienza's Le straordinarie avventure di Pentothal (Pentothal's Extraordinary Adventures), in which the author details in a stream of consciousness his own experiences with drugs, arts, politics, counterculture, and the Movement of 1977, through a thinly veiled alter ego. * In 1978, Eddie Campbell started his autobio strip \\"In the Days of the Ace Rock 'n' Roll Club\\" (March 1978 ‚Äì March 1979). (This led to his Alec stories, see below.) * In 1979, Malaysian cartoonist Lat published his childhood memoir The Kampung Boy (drawn 1977‚Äì1978). * In the late 1970s, Jim Valentino began his career with some autobio minicomics, released in the early 1980s.Jim Valentino at Lambiek Comiclopedia\\"A Touch of Image: An interview with Jim Valentino\\", CBR.com, February 1st, 2002 In 1985, he published his autobio series Valentino (later collected in Vignettes). In 1997, he created the semi-autobio series A Touch of Silver about a boy coming of age in the 1960s. In 2007, he revisited autobio with Drawings from Life (also collected in Vignettes). * Throughout the 1970s, autobiographical writing was prominent in the work of many female underground cartoonists, in anthologies such as Wimmen's Comix, ranging from comical anecdotes to feminist commentary based on the artists' lives. 1980s * In 1980, Art Spiegelman combined biography and autobiography in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus (serialized 1980‚Äì1991), about his father's Holocaust experiences, his own relationship with his father, and the process of interviewing him for the book. This work had a major effect on the reception of comics in general upon the world of mainstream prose literature, awakening many to the potential of comics as a medium for stories other than adventure fantasy. * In 1982, Eddie Campbell's Alec stories started with the Scottish/Australian artist as a young man drifting through life with his friends, and followed him through marriage, parenthood, and a successful artistic career. (They were later collected in The King Canute Crowd, Three Piece Suit, and other books.) * Campbell's English colleague Glenn Dakin created the Abraham Rat stories (collected in Abe: Wrong for All the Right Reasons), which began as fantasy and became more contemplative and autobiographical. * Spain Rodriguez drew a number of stories, collected in My True Story, about being a motorcycle gang member in the 1950s. *In the early 1980s, Carol Tyler shifted from making autobiographical paintings to comics. Her first published comics piece appeared in Weirdo in 1987. * Underground legend Robert Crumb focused increasingly on autobiography in his 1980s stories in Weirdo magazine. Many other autobiographical shorts would appear in Weirdo by other artists, including his wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Carol Tyler, Phoebe Gloeckner (see below in 1990s section), and Dori Seda. * In 1987, Sam Glanzman released his WWII graphic memoir A Sailor's Story (Marvel Comics), a more personal extension of his 1970s U.S.S. Stevens war stories. *In 1988, Andrea Pazienza releases Pompeo, his last graphic novel, depicting the gradual downfall of a heroin addict (a largely autobiographical character), up to his eventual suicide. * Jim Woodring's unusual \\"autojournal\\" Jim combined dream art with occasional episodes of realistic autobiography. * David Collier, a Canadian ex-soldier, published autobiographical and historical comics in Weirdo and later in his series Collier's. * In 1987, DC Comics' anthology Wasteland (1987‚Äì1989) featured, unusually for a mainstream title, as well as more conventional forms of black comedy and horror, semi-autobiographical stories based on the life of co-writer Del Close. One of the stories also parodied the autobiographical stories of Harvey Pekar, portraying a version of Pekar's famous appearance on Late Night with David Letterman, in which Pekar's vehement critique of General Electric had earned him a longtime ban from the program. * In 1989, John Porcellino started in his long-running autobio series King-Cat Comics (still ongoing). 1990s Autobiographical work took the alternative comics scene by storm during this period. The autobiographical genre had turned into English-speaking alternative comics subculture's \\"signature genre\\" in much the way that superhero stories dominated the American mainstream comic books, the stereotypical example recounting the awkward moment which followed when, the cartoonist sitting alone in a coffee shop when their ex-girlfriend walks in. However many artists pursued broader themes. * Maltese-American Joe Sacco appeared as a character in his journalistic comics, beginning with Yahoo (collected in Notes from a Defeatist) and Palestine. * Howard Cruse's graphic novel Stuck Rubber Baby told a fictionalized version of Cruse's young adulthood as a gay man in the South during civil rights conflicts. * In the anthology series Real Stuff, Dennis Eichhorn followed Pekar's example of writing true stories for others to illustrate, but unlike Pekar, emphasized unlikely tales of sex and violence. Many of the Real Stuff stories took place in Eichhorn's native state of Idaho. In 1993, Eichhorn received an Eisner Award nomination for Best Writer and his Real Stuff series received nominations for both Best Continuing Series and Best Anthology. In 1994, Real Stuff again received an Eisner Award nomination for Best Anthology. * One of the most popular self-published mini-comics of the 1990s in America, Silly Daddy, depicted Joe Chiappetta's parenthood and divorce, sometimes realistically and sometimes in a parallel fantasy story. The story continued in trade paperbacks and as a webcomic. *The Job Thing, 1993. Carol Tyler details her troubles with low paying jobs. A collection of stories originally published in Street Music Magazine. * Julie Doucet's series Dirty Plotte, from Canada, began as a mix of outlandish fantasy and dream comics, but moved toward autobiography in what was later collected as My New York Diary. * A trio of Canadian friends, Seth (Palookaville), Chester Brown (Yummy Fur, The Playboy, I Never Liked You), and Joe Matt (Peepshow), gained rapid renown in North America for their different approaches to autobiography. Brown and Matt were also notorious for depicting embarrassing personal moments such as masturbation and nose-picking. Seth created some controversy by presenting realistic fictional stories as if they had actually happened, not as a ploy to fool writers but as a literary technique. However some readers did get fooled. * Phoebe Gloeckner created a series of semi-autobiographical stories drawing on her adolescent experiences with sex and drugs in San Francisco, collected in A Child's Life and Other Stories. She later revisited similar material in her 2004 illustrated novel The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures. * Seven Miles a Second, written by painter David Wojnarowicz and illustrated by James Romberger and Marguerite Van Cook, was based on Wojnarowicz's life and his response to the AIDS epidemic. * The graphic novel David Chelsea in Love described the eponymous author's romantic difficulties in New York City and Portland. * Rick Veitch told the story of his twenties entirely through a dream diary in the Crypto Zoo volume of Rare Bit Fiends. * Ariel Schrag's tetralogy Awkward, Definition, Potential, and Likewise, about discovering her sexual identity in high school, was unusual in having been mostly completed while in high school. * Jim Valentino's A Touch of Silver portrayed his unhappy youth in the 1960s. * English artist Raymond Briggs, best known for his children's books, told the story of his parents' marriage in Ethel and Ernest. * James Kochalka started to turn his daily life into a daily four-panel strip starting in 1998, collected in Sketchbook Diaries, and later in the webcomic, American Elf. =1990s in France= This period also saw a rapid expansion of the French small-press comics scene, including a new emphasis on autobiographical work: * Fabrice Neaud's acclaimed Journal was the first lengthy autobiographical series in French comics. * David B., another artist who had first published fantasy comics stories, produced the graphic novel L'ascension du haut mal (published in English as Epileptic) applied B.'s distinctive non-realistic style to the story of his equally unusual upbringing, in which his family moved to a macrobiotic commune and sought many other cure's for B.'s brother's grand mal seizures. * Lewis Trondheim portrayed himself and his friends, albeit with animal heads, in Approximative continuum comics, some of which was later published in English as The Nimrod. * Much of Edmond Baudoin's later work is based on his personal and family history. * Dupuy and Berberain's \\"Journal d'un album\\" and Jean- Christophe Menu's \\"Livre de Phamille\\" also had a significant influence on the French autobiographic graphic novel scene. 2000s * Iranian exile Marjane Satrapi created the multi-volume Persepolis, originally published as a newspaper serial in France, about her childhood during the Iranian Revolution. * Canadian animator Guy Delisle published several travelogues such as Shenzhen, Pyongyang, Burma Chronicles and Jerusalem * The Spiral Cage, by English artist Al Davison, is about Davison's experience of living with spina bifida. * Jeffrey Brown's Clumsy (2001) and Unlikely (2003) told the story of two failed relationships using hundreds of single-page stories. * Craig Thompson releases Blankets, an award-winning graphic memoir of first love, religious identity, and coming of age. *Marzena Sowa wrote Marzi, a series of comics about her childhood in 1980s-era Poland. * Art Spiegelman wrote In the Shadow of No Towers (2004), an oversize graphic memoir about his experiences during the 9/11 attacks. * Josh Neufeld published his Xeric Award-winning A Few Perfect Hours (2004), documenting his backpacking adventures through Southeast Asia, Central Europe, and Turkey. * Joe Kubert wrote Yossel April 14, 1943 (2005), a \\"fake autobiographical graphic novel\\" about what would have happened if his parents hadn't moved from Poland to the US and they would have been there during the Holocaust. *Carol Tyler published Late Bloomer, which features all the collected works from Weirdo and other publications. * Italian comic book artist Gipi releases several graphic novels inspired by his own life experiences: Appunti per una storia di guerra (Notes for a War Story, 2005), S.

References Category:Comics genres comics ","title":"Autobiographical comics"},{"id":"915996","text":"L'Ascension du haut mal (\\"The Rise of the High Evil\\"), published in English as Epileptic, is an autobiographical graphic novel by David Beauchard (more commonly known as David B.). Publication history It was originally published in French by L'Association in six volumes from 1996 to 2003: # 1996 () # 1997 () # 1998 () # 1999 () # 2000 () # 2003 () The first half of the series was published in English by Fantagraphics in one volume in 2002 (); a complete edition was released by Pantheon in 2005. Plot The book tells the story of the artist's early childhood and adolescence, focusing on his relationship with his brother and sister. His brother develops severe and intractable epilepsy, causing the family to seek a variety of solutions from alternative medicine, most dramatically by moving to a commune based on macrobiotic principles. As the epileptic brother loses control of his own life, the artist develops solitary obsessions with cartoons, mythology and war. The book's graphic style becomes increasingly elaborate as the children's fantasy life takes over, with their dreams and fears (including epilepsy itself) appearing as living creatures. In brief interludes, the children appear as adults when the artist begins the process of writing the story. Translation The French title proved difficult to translate, as it contains several meanings: haut mal is an archaic term for epilepsy meaning literally \\"high evil\\" or \\"great sickness\\" (formerly used as a medical term in English, now replaced by grand mal), and ascension can mean either rise or climbing, as seen in a recurring image of the family climbing a steep slope into unknown terrain. Reception The English translation of the book received very good reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 92 out of 100, based on 15 reviews. Publishers Weekly has called it \\"one of the greatest graphic novels ever published.\\" Awards The fourth volume won the 2000 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario.

The effect was first reported as an anomalous precession of the plane of oscillation of a Foucault pendulum during the solar eclipse of June 30, 1954 by Maurice Allais, a French polymath who went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. Allais reported another observation of the effect during the solar eclipse of October 2, 1959 using the paraconical pendulum he invented. This study earned him the 1959 Galabert Prize of the French Astronautical Society and made him a laureate of the U.S. Gravity Research Foundation for his 1959 memoir on gravity. The veracity of the Allais effect remains controversial among the scientific community, as its testing has frequently met with inconsistent or ambiguous results over more than five decades of observation. Experimental observations Maurice Allais emphasized the \\"dynamic character\\" of the effects he observed: Besides Allais' own experiments, related research about a possible effect of the Moon's shielding, absorption or bending of the Sun's gravitational field during a solar eclipse have been conducted by scientists around the world. Some observations have yielded positive results, seemingly confirming that minute but detectable variations in the expected behavior of devices dependent on gravity do indeed occur within the umbra of an eclipse, but others have failed to detect any noticeable effect. =Anomalous results= Romanian physicist Gheorghe Jeverdan et al. observed the Allais effect and the so-called Jeverdan-Rusu-Antonescu effect or Jeverdan effect (i.e. the change in the oscillation period of a pendulum during an eclipse) while monitoring a Foucault pendulum during the solar eclipse of February 15, 1961. The authors made two hypotheses regarding their observation: during an eclipse, the Moon exerts a screening effect on the gravitational attraction of the Sun so that the attraction of the Earth is indirectly increased, a phenomenon that could also be studied with tides. If the hypothesis of the screening effect is wrong, another explanation could be that the variation of the Earth's gravity might be considered as a result of the diffraction of gravitational waves. Erwin Saxl and Mildred Allen similarly reported strong anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during the solar eclipse of March 7, 1970 and concluded that \\"gravitational theory needs to be modified\\". Dr. Leonid Savrov of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute built a dedicated paraconical pendulum to test the Allais effect during the solar eclipse of July 11, 1991 in Mexico and the eclipse of November 3, 1994 in Brazil. While he could not observe Allais' claim that there is a diurnal periodicity in the motion of a paraconical pendulum, he did, however, write: \\"The most interesting result of the Mexico and Brazil experiments is the increase of rotational velocity of the pendulum oscillation plane in the direction of the Foucault effect during the eclipse. It seems that we have some kind of special effect.\\" Various other experiments using atomic clocks and gravimeters instead of pendulums also recorded significant anomalous gravitational effects which can neither be caused by a tidal effect or drift of the gravimeters, nor by high-frequency noise which has special patterns. These experiments were set up by different teams during solar eclipses in China in 1992, India in 1995, and China in 1997. Dutch physicist Chris Duif, who surveys the field of gravitational anomalies in general, concludes that the question remains open because Allais observations do not satisfy conventional explanations, and that such investigations should be pursued, in view of their relatively inexpensive nature and the enormous implications if genuine anomalies are actually confirmed, but the article was self-published and has not undergone any peer review. Results confirming observation of the Allais and Jeverdan-Rusu-Antonescu effects during the annular solar eclipse of September 22, 2006 were presented the following year by a Romanian team, with a quantization of the behavior of the paraconical pendulum. During the solar eclipse of August 1, 2008, a Ukrainian team and two Romanian teams worked together hundreds of kilometers apart with different apparatuses: five independent miniature torsion balances for the Ukrainian team, two independent short ball-borne pendulums for a Romanian team and a long Foucault pendulum for the third team. All three teams detected unexplained and mutually correlated disturbances. The same teams repeated a dual experiment during the annular solar eclipse of January 26, 2009, this time outside of the umbra, with the same significant correlation between the behavior of light torsion balances and a Foucault pendulum. They also registered similar anomalies using a Foucault pendulum and a very light torsion balance, both located underground in a disused salt mine with minimal interference, during the partial solar eclipse of June 1, 2011. =Inconclusive or negative results= Louis B. Slichter, using a gravimeter during the solar eclipse of February 15, 1961 in Florence, Italy, failed to detect an associated gravitational signal. During the solar eclipse of July 22, 1990, no anomalous period increase of a torsion pendulum was detected independently by a team in Finland and another team in Belomorsk, USSR. The total solar eclipse of August 11, 1999 had been a good opportunity to solve a 45-year mystery, thanks to an international collaboration. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center first inquired about experimental protocols to Maurice Allais, in order to coordinate ahead of the event a worldwide effort to test the Allais effect between observatories and universities over seven countries (United States, Austria, Germany, Italy, Australia, England and four sites in the United Arab Emirates). The lead supervisor then stated: \\"The initial interpretation of the record points to three possibilities: a systematic error, a local effect, or the unexplored. To eliminate the first two possibilities, we and several other observers will use different kinds of measuring instruments in a distributed global network of observing stations.\\" However, after the eclipse, Allais criticized the experiments in his final NASA report, writing the period of observation was \\"much too short [‚Ä¶] to detect anomalies properly\\". Moreover, the lead supervisor left NASA shortly thereafter with the gathered data and the NASA study has never been published. Further observations conducted by the team led by Xin-She Yang appear to have yielded much weaker evidence of anomalies than their first 1997 study. The authors first posited a more conventional explanation based on temperature changes causing ground tilting, but later suggested that this explanation was unlikely. A possible yet controversial explanation was finally proposed by the same author and Tom Van Flandern which conjectured that the anomaly is due to the gravitational effect of an increased air density spot in the upper atmosphere created by cooling winds during the solar eclipse. They conclude there have been \\"no unambiguous detections [of an Allais effect] within the past 30 years when consciousness of the importance of [experimental] controls was more widespread.\\" They point out that \\"the gravitation anomaly discussed here is about a factor of 100,000 too small to explain the Allais excess pendulum precession [‚Ä¶] during eclipses\\" and from this conclude that the original Allais anomaly was merely due to poor controls. Eight gravimeters and two pendulums were deployed across six monitoring sites in China for the solar eclipse of July 22, 2009. Although one of the scientists involved described in an interview having observed the Allais effect, no result has been published in any academic journal. An automated Foucault pendulum was also used during the solar eclipse of July 11, 2010 in Argentina, with no evidence of a precession change of the pendulum's oscillation plane (< 0.3 degree per hour). Aether hypothesis Maurice Allais states that the eclipse effect is related to a gravitational anomaly that is inexplicable in the framework of the currently admitted theory of gravitation, without giving any explanation of his own. Allais' explanation for another anomaly (the lunisolar periodicity in variations of the azimuth of a pendulum) is that space evinces certain anisotropic characteristics, which he ascribes to motion through an aether which is partially entrained by planetary bodies. His hypothesis leads to a speed of light dependent on the moving direction with respect to a terrestrial observer, since the Earth moves within the aether but the rotation of the Moon induces a \\"wind\\" of about 8 km/s. Thus Allais rejects Einstein's interpretation of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment and the subsequent verification experiments of Dayton Miller. In particular, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment did not give a zero speed difference, but at most 8 km/s, without being able to detect any regularity. This difference was therefore interpreted as due to measurement uncertainties. Similarly, Miller's experiments corroborated these results over a long period of time, but Miller could not explain the source of the irregularities. At the time, temperature problems were invoked to explain the cause, as concluded by Robert S. Shankland. By re-analyzing the data from this experiment, Allais reported a periodicity using sidereal time rather than civil time used by Miller (daytime sidereal variation of the speed of light over a period of 23 hours 56 minutes with an amplitude of about 8 km/s). Applying the Titius‚ÄìBode law to the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, which he generalizes to aether, Allais calculates a \\"wind\\" of 7.95 km/s, which is comparable to the values found by the experiments of Michelson and Miller. Hence Allais deduces that the aether turns with the stars, as proposed by the aether drag hypothesis, and is not fixed as Hendrik Lorentz thought when inventing his famous transformation and his ether theory. But the majority of scientists at the end of the 19th century imagined that such an aether crossed the Earth so that the rotation of the Earth around the Sun would cause an important variation of 30 km/s. Consequently, since the third postulate on which special relativity is based is the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum, Allais considers it unfounded. In order to measure a change in the speed of light, one would have to get back to the definition of the 1960 meter, since confidence in the theory of relativity nowadays is such that current metrology uses constancy of the speed of light as an axiom. Allais summarized his experimental work in English in his 1999 memoir on behalf of NASA. He detailed his aether hypothesis in the books L'Anisotropie de l'Espace, published in 1997, and L'Effondrement de la Th√©orie de la Relativit√©, published in 2004. A book on Allais' scientific legacy has been edited in English in 2011, yet his aether hypothesis has not gained significant traction among mainstream scientists. Nevertheless, after Allais' death in 2010, experiments on the Allais effect continue.

Set in 2049, the story follows Chris Faulkner as he starts his new job as a junior executive at Shorn Associates, working in their Conflict Investment division where the company supports foreign governments in exchange for a percentage of the country's gross domestic product. Contracts are awarded, and promotions are given to employees, through driving duels in which combatants race vehicles on empty roads and often kill their opponents. With the Shorn-supported Colombian dictator Echevarria expected to transfer power to his son, who is supported by a competing firm, Chris allies Shorn with a rebel group to overthrow the government, though other executives attempt to sabotage his plans. First published in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, the book is Morgan's third novel, the first two being part of the Takeshi Kovacs series. Market Forces satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used as a metaphor for the mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and action sequences received praise. Background Market Forces was science fiction author Richard K. Morgan's third novel. His first two novels, Altered Carbon (2002) and Broken Angels (2003), were the first two parts of a trilogy later completed with Woken Furies (2005). That Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, hardboiled detective fiction set in the 25th century, gave Morgan a reputation for writing excellent action sequences along with a Philip K. Dick Award. Before the third part of the trilogy was published, Morgan worked on his idea for Market Forces, which he conceived of as a short story, then developed as a film script, then as a novel. At the time, Morgan was 38 years old living in Glasgow, Scotland. He has sold the filming rights to Altered Carbon to Warner Bros. (he would also sell the rights to Market Forces to Warner Bros.) allowing him to leave his job as an English teacher at the University of Strathclyde to focus on his writing career. Plot In 2049, Chris Faulkner is recruited by Shorn Associates, an investment firm in London. There he befriends Mike Bryant, a fellow junior executive in the \\"Conflict Investment\\" division. Conflict Investment provides resources to incumbent or rebel factions in exchange for promised share of the nation's gross domestic product. CI members often toast to continued \\"small wars\\" as their primary source of income for themselves and their investors. Executive advancement in 2049 is not based on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head- hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship. During a night out in the one of the Zones ‚Äì the cordoned off zone of decaying ghettos surrounding the City of London ‚Äì Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Colombia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son. As it is clear that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader. As the conflict in Colombia tilts in favour of the son, Hamilton goes outside of the normal chain of command to plan the execution of Barranco and the elimination of the local Shorn representative in a gladiatorial duel. Faulkner finds out about this and barges into a video conference Hamilton is having with Francisco, telling him that he in fact killed his father with his bare hands. He then beats Hamilton and breaks his neck. He is duly captured and placed in a Corporation operated jail. In jail, Chris is offered a choice: be convicted of murder and have his organs harvested after being subject to capital punishment or participate in face-saving (for Shorn) farce by saying he had legally issued a challenge to Hamilton for his position in the firm. Conditions of this agreement are steep however as he must drive against Mike Bryant, who he had grown to be truly close with, but who is now completely done with him with revelation of Chris' affair with Liz Linshaw and Chris' brutal killings outside of the bounds of the challenge process. The night prior to the challenge, the UN representative returns with the chance for Chris to escape and reunite with his estranged wife, who has left the country. He declines. Mike is the superior driver but using a creative interpretation of challenge rules, Chris forces Mike to drive off a bridge and into the Zones. Chris finds the badly injured Mike and kills him just before a gang, who had watched the duel on television, finds them. The gang beats Chris but he survives when the gang is gunned down by Driver Control authorities, the sanctioning body for duels. The story ends with Chris, as the new senior executive, giving the new dictator Francisco Echevarria 48 hours to flee his country in favour of installing Barranco. Style and themes Market Forces is a science fiction thriller set nearly fifty years after its writing featuring a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in free market capitalism out fifty years to a point where corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, can be viewed as a personification of the story's take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into the corporate culture. The review in The New York Times compared the corporate culture and market mechanisms that led to the Enron scandal with the fictional background of the novel. The same reviewer compared Market Forces to Robert Stone's A Flag for Sunrise which also concerns political and social issues but in a fictional Central American country. The story's use of social commentary is similar to the works of science fiction authors Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth in the 1950s. Book reviewer Nisi Shawl wrote that this story could be part of a subgenre of stories using life-in-a-corporation as a background, along with Eileen Gunn's \\"Stable Strategies for Middle Management\\", Kelley Eskridge's \\"Solitaire\\", and Charles Stross' Accelerando. Morgan's use of action sequences and car chases led to several comparisons to similar movie sequences, and specifically to Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay movies. =Competition= The physical violence in the story is a metaphor for the mechanisms behind capitalism. Morgan uses competition as theme throughout novel, punctuated by the \\"portrayal of a society governed by extreme violence, ruthlessness and with no account for law, morals or humanity\\". Violent competition, where the losers die, is the norm and comes in the form of businesses competing for contracts, employees competing for promotions, foreign governments fighting insurgents, and other stand-offs between characters. Non-violent competition is viewed as a novelty or ineffective, like playing chess or publishing opinion essays. The existence of winners and losers and the duality of \\"haves and the have-nots\\" are contrasted. By illustrating how the First World exploits the Third World and the corporate executive's use of the ghetto areas, the novel challenges the idea that the have-nots are there by choice or that they competed and lost. Publication and reception Market Forces was published by Gollancz in United Kingdom and Del Rey Books in North America. The hardcover was released simultaneously in 2004 along with the ebook and audiobook versions. The audiobook, read unabridged by Simon Vance was published by Tantor Media in CD and mp3 formats. A tradepaperback version was released by the same publishers in 2007. The book was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for best science fiction novel first published in the United Kingdom. Numerous reviewers commented on the action sequences and violence with several noting they were better suited to a theatrical version rather than literature. While reviewers variously called it a \\"high-octane, stomach-churning terror ride\\" and \\"turbo-injected with moral ambiguity\\", others noted that the action eventually grows tiresome. Reviewers also noted that the \\"action sequences [are used to] keep the critique from becoming preachy\\" or otherwise too serious. In The San Diego Union-Tribune, the reviewer wrote \\"As a motorhead, I liked a lot of elements in this novel. On the other hand, I found a lot of the corporate and corp-rat behavior ranged from disturbing to disgusting.\\" The reviewer in The Mercury concluded, \\"This is not comfortable or enjoyable bedtime reading. The inventive language, punk dialogue and feverish action create sustained tension throughout...It's hell-on-wheels fiction‚Äîentertainment that will appeal to many, particularly those who are hot car enthusiasts.\\" Numerous reviewers commented on Morgan's writing and story. In The Seattle Times, journalist and science fiction author Nisi Shawl tied the writing quality to the action scenes, \\"Morgan's talent for tension- building is matched by the clarity with which he describes the sideswiping, rubber-burning, rear-end-ramming, full-contact racing scenes. And both these skills are quietly eclipsed by his word-for-word writing ability. Apt metaphors and similes abound.\\" However, science fiction critic Robert K. J. Killheffer, in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, wrote \\"it's not his best ‚Äì it lacks the dense and evocative background of his Takeshi Kovacs books, and Morgan is not as sure-handed with near-future situations and characters ‚Äì but it takes chances and largely succeeds.\\" Likewise, in the San Francisco Chronicle the reviewer wrote \\"In its present form, the novel feels bloated and obvious, despite the sharpness of the descriptive writing and a couple of first-rate fight sequences. With the right artist, Market Forces might still make a compelling‚Äîand necessarily shorter‚Äîgraphic novel.\\" The Library Journal review ended with a recommendation: \\"Morgan's sf suspense belongs in most sf collections.\\" The reviewer in Booklist concluded \\"It's not a particularly pleasant future, but Morgan paints it in broad strokes, drawing us into his future world and making it feel like a natural outgrowth of today's corporate chicanery. The novel might have been unremittingly bleak if it weren't for the moral center provided by Faulkner, who is a genuinely likable guy. Fans of Morgan's gritty, noirish brand of sf will flock to this one.\\" References External links * An interview by Francesco Troccoli, August 2008 Category:2004 British novels Category:2004 science fiction novels Category:British science fiction novels Category:John W.

He is a death knight and fallen Knight of Solamnia from the world of Krynn. According to Tracy Hickman, he needed a powerful character for the Heroes of the Lance to fight at the High Clerist's Tower, and Lord Soth suddenly came into his mind with a complete history and personality. The popularity of Lord Soth as a character has defined what a death knight means to the writers of the Dungeons & Dragons game over the years. Soth was also named as one of the greatest villains in D&D; history in the final print issue of Dragon. Appearance Soth stands 6'5\\" or taller, wearing a full suit of Solamnic plate mail of ancient design. Damage from many battles mars the delicate ornamentation on his armor, obscuring its intricate carvings of kingfishers and roses, leaving only a charred black rose on the breastplate, which became Soth's symbol. A long purple cloak hangs heavily on his shoulders, draped behind him almost to his knees. A tassel of long black hair tops his helm, as worn and ancient as the rest of his armor. A sword black with the blood of countless victims hangs sheathed on his hip. Of the death knight himself, only two flaming dots red as blood shine from the eye slits on the helm. His voice seems an echo from the depth of a bottomless cavern. Like all death knights, there is always an aura of freezing unearthly cold around Soth, the demeanor so terrifying that even kender have been known to be frightened. Under his armor, he is a corpse of some sort, with very dark gray to almost black skin, when he pulls off one of his gauntlets, and also when he was able to take off his helmet and drink the water from the lake of Sounds, in the novel Spectre of the Black Rose. When traveling, Soth is usually mounted on a nightmare, a demonic steed with ebony skin and flaming hooves. Combat Although evil and filled with an intense hatred for all living creatures, most of the time Soth retains a semblance of the pride he held as a Solamnic knight, and fights honorably. He will never ambush an opponent from behind, nor does he strike before his enemy can ready his weapon. Aside from these facts, however, Soth is a terrible enemy. An undead abomination, Soth has inhuman strength, which is further enhanced by his skill with the sword; something that he learned as a former Knight of the Rose. Soth also can cast various type of spells, including huge fireballs, magical words which stun or kill enemies, ice walls, cone of cold, etc. With a single word, Soth can snuff the life out of a red dragon (thus Power Word: Kill), or shatter the great city gate of Palanthas, which was formerly known as the \\"Unconquered City\\". History =Life as a knight= Soth was a Knight of the Rose, the most esteemed rank of knight in the Knights of Solamnia, and married. While on a trip he encountered a band of ogres attacking elven priestesses; Soth fell in love with the fairest priestess, the Silvanesti Elf Isolde Denissa, and eventually managed to seduce her, bringing her back to Dargaard Keep as a friend in the eyes of the public and his wife. Soth's wife Korrine and her lady-in-waiting then visited a witch to help her conceive a child; the witch agreed, but warned that the child would be a representation of Soth's soul. Korrine eventually gave birth to an abomination, and Soth, thinking his wife consorted with some kind of demon, killed her and their child. Korrine's lady-in-waiting revealed to Soth's superior that Isolde was pregnant with his bastard child and he was brought before the Court of High Justice at Palanthas. Soth's lie about his wife and child passing in childbirth was corroborated by Istvan the healer, who was later compelled by the court to tell the truth about Soth's crime. Before he could be executed, Soth escaped back to Dargaard Keep. =Undead curse= Besieged by the other knights, Soth's mood turned black, and he even struck his new wife, Isolde, on one occasion. When he realized what he had become, he prayed to Paladine and his wife prayed to Mishakal. Mishakal showed her the future and the destruction that the arrogant Kingpriest of Istar was about to call upon Krynn. She was told that Soth could stop the Cataclysm, but he would die in the attempt. Isolde told Soth about her vision and he set out to redeem himself. On the way to Istar he encountered a group of three elf-maids. They poisoned Soth's mind with lies about his wife's infidelity. Enraged, Soth turned from his quest and confronted his wife just as the Cataclysm began. A chandelier fell upon his wife and newborn son, setting her aflame. His wife begged for him to save their child, but Soth stopped himself from doing so, to prevent his own son from growing up as he had. As her life ended she cursed him, saying \\"you shall live the lifetime of every soul that you have caused death today\\", and upon pronunciation of the curse the fire engulfed the entire keep, seemingly slaying Soth, his retainers, and the rest of the keep's inhabitants. Soth became a death knight and his followers became skeleton warriors. The three elf-maids became banshees, cursed to remind him of his folly every night. =War of the Lance= Several centuries later, the evil goddess Takhisis launched the War of the Lance to conquer Krynn and wanted Lord Soth to assist her armies. Soth informed Takhisis he would only be willing to serve the Dragon Highlord (Takhisis's top generals) with enough courage and strength to survive one night in Dargaard Keep. Only the Dragon Highlord known as the Blue Lady, Kitiara Uth Matar, accepted this challenge. Kitiara survived the night, winning Soth's service. Lord Soth would soon prove an invaluable ally to Kitiara. It was Soth that prevented Emperor Ariakas from executing Kitiara for the defeats she suffered in the Vingaard Campaign, and it was Soth who effected the successful kidnapping of Laurana, the Golden General of the Good Armies (who also happened to be Kitiara's romantic rival for the heart of Tanis Half-Elven.) Soth became obsessed with Laurana, whose radiant elven beauty reminded him so much of Isolde, so he entered into a conspiracy with Kitiara where he would help her obtain the Crown of Power from Ariakas in exchange for her having Takhisis grant him the soul of Laurana, who would then suffer in undeath with him for all eternity. Thus at the Council of Highlords in Neraka, Soth personally carried the captive Laurana, who had been tightly wrapped into a cocoon of winding cloth, to Kitiara. The Dragon Highlord then cut Laurana out of the cocoon, offered her up as a gift to Takhisis and received Takhisis's blessing for the elfmaid's soul to be granted to Lord Soth. However, Soth's desire would be frustrated when Tanis Half-Elven assassinated Emperor Ariakas and then Laurana escaped as the Dragonarmies began fighting amongst themselves. Soth eliminated the Green and Black Dragon Highlords, Kitiara's potential rivals for the Crown of Power, during this fighting but failed to obtain Laurana's soul, as Kitiara allowed Tanis and Laurana to escape. Soth mocked Kitiara for this apparent act of mercy, but Kitiara then told the death knight she did it only so she would always live in Tanis' heart, which would forever taint his relationship with Laurana. Soth accepted this answer and then presented Kitiara with the Crown of Power while vowing his undying service to her. =Blue Lady's War= Several years after the end of the War of the Lance, Lord Soth would again assist Kitiara during the Blue Lady's War. Under his command, a great number of undead creatures (including his skeletal warriors and banshees with wyvern-carried chariots) breached Palanthas the Unconquered City. However, Soth had his own motivations. He had become completely obsessed with Kitiara (whose self- serving nature and survival-instinct had somehow rekindled his undead heart), and decided to make her become his eternal consort. Thus Soth waited until the dark elf wizard, Dalamar, struck Kitiara down during the fighting and then claimed Kitiara's body. Once Soth had Kitiara's body, he had his forces withdraw from Palanthas. Without their undead allies, the rest of Kitiara's forces were soon defeated by the Palanthians. However, due to the treachery of one of Soth's servants, Caradoc, his plan to obtain Kitiara's soul failed. The role-playing video game Death Knights of Krynn, in which Soth was featured, also happened during this era. =Ravenloft= The Mists of Ravenloft plucked Soth and Caradoc from Krynn while the two battled. His soul was brought to the domain of Barovia; wanting to return to Krynn, Soth sought out Strahd von Zarovich, the ruler of the domain, in the hope Strahd would help him. Strahd tried to use Soth to his advantage but this only cost him a red dragon which was one of his castle guardians. After a series of adventures with the Vistani girl, Magda, and the were-badger Azrael Dak, Soth had found out that Strahd was hiding Caradoc from him. Soth attacked Strahd unceasingly and the vampire had no choice but to release Caradoc in order to keep his domain in one piece. Soth then pursued Caradoc until he finally caught him at the edge of the mists. Soth was then given the domain Sithicus (\\"land of spectres\\" in the elven tongue) in Ravenloft by the Mists after he exacted his vengeance on Caradoc's ghost. His new castle, Nedragaard Keep (Solamnic, meaning: \\"not Dargaard\\"), was made as mockery of Dargaard in Krynn with a continually changing form so Soth could not maintain the military order he was accustomed to. During the Grand Conjunction he briefly returned to his Krynn body. Soth's experiences in Sithicus had changed him only slightly. Throughout his time in the Dread Realm, Soth found himself entering mirror worlds, each which contained a portion of his past. Through these he lived in worlds of fantasy, ignoring the world beyond his keep. It is believed that his refusal to face his past sins and his willingness to suffer his curse led to his release from the Mists; Soth simply withdrew and ignored Sithicus until he was released. The story of his ascension is told in Knight of the Black Rose, the story of his temporary release is told in World of Krynn, and the story of his final release is told in Spectre of the Black Rose. =War of Souls= In the 2002 book Dragon of a Vanished Moon, upon his return to Krynn, Mina, Chosen of Takhisis, attempted to recruit Soth to lead the Dark Queen's armies. Soth had dwelt too long in solitude. This was time enough for him to come to peace with himself; to know how he had wronged his wife and child. He refused the goddess' invitation. In retaliation for this insult, Takhisis ironically delivered Lord Soth one final blessing: she restored his mortality. The Dark Queen then destroyed his keep, crushing him to death beneath its rubble. The fallen knight perished with a measure of his honor restored, vowing that he would forever search for the elf maid and his son in the afterlife. He hoped, that in this search, he would be redeemed. Reception Lauren Davis of io9 commented that \\"Lord Soth is one of those great, classically styled villains. The undead man in a suit of armor is nothing new, but Soth is played to nicely creepy effect, and he comes with a horrific backstory straight out of a dark fairytale, one filled with wife murder and lost honor. That he's not even the main villain of the piece speaks to Weis and Hickman's ability to balance a host of powerful and terrible characters.\\" Lord Soth was #10 on Game Rant's 2020 \\"10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons & Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome\\" list ‚Äî the article states that \\"As an NPC, Lord Soth can prove to be a formidable opponent against an adventuring party. Lord Soth not only has a skeletal army serving him, he can also simply point at living thing and kill them by uttering \\"Die.\\"\\" Debate Soth's tenure in Ravenloft is a topic of debate. The creators of Soth argue that they did not give their permission for Soth to be used in the Ravenloft Campaign setting. However, they had no legal ownership of the character and, at the time Soth was moved, were not associated with TSR or Wizards of the Coast. Wizards of the Coast has been vague on the subject but the last official word on the subject was that Soth did indeed enter Ravenloft but that the Mists returned him to Krynn at the very instant he was removed. It is also mentioned in an article in Dragon #351 that the new dark lord of Sithicus is plagued by a mockery of Lord Soth. This \\"White Knight\\" version of Soth shows how anyone can be redeemed and is an anathema to that Dark Lord's corrupting influence on the land.Dragon #351 Other media =Video games= Lord Soth was the primary antagonist in Death Knights of Krynn. In a review of the game in Computer Gaming World, Soth is described as a \\"necrophiliac\\" who enjoys nothing as much as \\"animating some hapless corpse and sending it out to wreak grave consequences on the world.\\" Lord Soth also appears as a non-playable character in the video game Iron & Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft.

He painted original works for the covers of Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell and The Very Best of Meat Loaf albums and several of his older paintings illustrate the liner notes of the former. Recently, he painted the cover art for thrash metal band Evile's album Infected Nations.  Biography  Michael Whelan was born in Culver City, California, the son of William and Nancy Whelan. As a child, he had a nomadic existence, moving nearly every other year, as the family followed his father's career in the aerospace industry. So he attended eight elementary schools, three junior high schools and four high schools, and often lived for a summer in other locations. He grew up in Colorado, several cities along the California coast, and in New Mexico, near the White Sands Missile Range. Whelan's time near White Sands and Vandenberg Air Force Base proved a lasting influence; in a 2000 interview, he noted that \\"living near to missile launching sites and Air Force bases had an impact. It was always thrilling to watch them go up ... and sometimes blow up.\\"AudioBookCafe.com. By the time he was a sophomore in high school, his family had moved to Denver, Colorado. There he began formal training in art, taking summer classes at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design. By his final year of high school, his family had moved again, to San Jose, California where he graduated from Oak Grove High School in 1968. Whelan continued school as a pre-medical biology major at San Jose State University, initially. There he worked in the Anatomy and Physiology Department, gaining a first-hand knowledge of human anatomy. He says that his job \\"involved all sorts of tasks related to the anatomy department, such as preparing cadavers for the classes, stringing bones together to make complete skeletons, making models of body parts, some medical illustration, etc.\\" Some of his collegiate medical drawings appeared in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. However, he became disenchanted by the limited creative opportunities in medical illustration and changed his major to Art during the middle of his junior year. After graduating from San Jose State University in 1973 with a BA in Painting (as a \\"President's Scholar\\"), Whelan studied briefly at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California for nine months from 1973 to 1974. In 1974, Whelan exhibited his work at the World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C., where it was seen by Thomas Schl√ºck, who first discovered his work and contracted to use it in European publications shortly afterwards. Donald A. Wollheim of DAW Books gave him his first American professional assignment‚Äîthe cover painting and frontispiece drawing for Lin Carter's fantasy novel, The Enchantress of World's End (May 1975)‚Äîafter seeing his artwork in a set of slides Whelan submitted in August 1974. Because he was already receiving offers for commissions, Whelan left the Art Center College of Design to pursue illustration full-time. In 1975, he moved to Connecticut to be near the New York City hub of the publishing industry. There he met Audrey Price, whom he later married. Shortly after arriving on the East Coast he exhibited some of his student work in the Lunacon convention art show in New York, where it was seen by Harlan Ellison. Ellison obtained the first magazine assignment for him, illustrating Ellison's story \\"Croatoan\\" which appeared in Gallery magazine. At Lunacon Michael also met Rick Bryant, who subsequently introduced him to Neal Adams. Adams called the art director of Ace Books and paved the way for his first assignment at Ace. In 1975, Whelan painted the cover illustrations for ten books, eight from DAW and two Ace reprints of early Darkover novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley. Quick to take advantage of these opportunities, Whelan soon gained a reputation as a talented, imaginative, and dependable cover artist, working for science fiction and fantasy publishers such as DAW, Del Rey, and Ace. Whelan credits the 1978 publication of Anne McCaffrey's best-selling The White Dragon featuring his cover art as a turning point in his career.FAQ: Illustration: Early Years . Michael Whelan. Retrieved 2011-07-25. The SF Hall of Fame agrees. Whelan won his first Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist in 1980 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Boston. He went on to win the next Hugos, and at the 50th Worldcon in 1992 was voted the best professional artist of the last 50 years. As of 2010, he has won fifteen Hugo Awards. When commissioned, Whelan made a practice of reading the entire book that he sought to illustrate, usually twice. \\"I try to let the book I'm illustrating determine the approach and subject matter,\\" he stated.An interview with Michael Whelan (1997?). Maurizio Manzieri. Delos International. Address confirmed 2011-07-25. Fantasist Michael Moorcock wrote of Whelan, \\"I am more than usually grateful for an artist who not only depicts him [Elric] as I imagine (and describe him) but who also manages to capture some of the appropriate atmosphere\\" (Wonderworks, p. 36). Science fiction writer Anne McCaffrey praised him, declaring, \\"Fortunate indeed is the author who has Michael Whelan for an illustrator\\" (Wonderworks, p. 55). Whelan illustrated the cover for Meat Loaf's 1993 album Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell. He also provided several illustrations for the insert booklet, which were also used for the single releases such as \\"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\\". Larger versions of his artwork were featured in the album's 2002 special edition release. He has since gone on to paint album cover artwork for many other recording artists, from Michael Jackson to Sepultura to Jonn Serrie. In the early 1990s, Whelan devoted his time to personal visions and gallery works. In 1997, he held his first one-man art show at Tree's Place in Orleans, Massachusetts. Its success led to another in 1999 and his eventual semi-retirement from illustration. Over the past two decades, many of Whelan's gallery pieces found their way into published projects, including the SPECTRUM art annuals. Whelan has returned to illustrate several major book covers during his semi-retirement, including the last book of Stephen King's Dark Tower series and the final volume of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time. In 2015, The Stephen King Companion: Four Decades of Fear from the Master of Horror, which feature Whelan's illustrations, was published by St. Martin's Press.

Stevens founded Brooks Stevens, Inc. headquartered in Allenton, Wisconsin. In 1944, along with Raymond Loewy and eight others, Stevens formed the Industrial Designers Society of America. Upon his death in 1995, The New York Times called Stevens \\"a major force in industrial design.\\" Background and personal life Stevens was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 7, 1911. Stricken with polio as a child, he was encouraged by his father to practice drawing while confined to his bed, perhaps motivating his career in design. He studied architecture at Cornell University from 1929 to 1933, and established his own home furnishings design firm in 1934 in Milwaukee.Stevens, Brooks 1911-1995 in online Dictionary of Wisconsin History (Wisconsin Historical Society) His son, Kipp Stevens, ran the Brooks Stevens Design Associates until late 2008, when he stepped down. In 1959, Stevens opened a 12,500sf automotive museum in Mequon, Wisconsin, which became a repository for his own designs as well as others‚Äîand became a production facility in the late 1980s for the Wienermobile fleet. The museum closed in 1999, four years after his death. Stevens died on January 4, 1995, in Milwaukee. He was survived by his wife Alice, sons Kipp, William, and David, a daughter, Sandra A. Stevens, and five grandchildren. Design The Stevens-designed Skytop Lounge with its distinctive glassed-in observation area. The 1949 Harley Davidson FL Hydra-Glide The 1962 Studebaker Hawk Gran Turismo The Jeep Wagoneer was designed by Brooks Stevens. His designs in home and kitchen appliances were popular, and he is recognized as the originator of the robin's-egg-blue phase of 1950s kitchen appliances,Tyler Friedman, \\"Happy Birthday Brooks Stevens: Industrial Design Gallery Turns Twenty,\\" Milwaukee Express, 9 Oct. 2013. Retrieved 5 July 2014. as well as the iconic Skylark laminate design popularized by Formica. He also practiced architectural design and graphic design. Of note is his design of the Miller Brewing logo and he is also credited with convincing the company to switch from traditional brown bottles to clear bottles. As an automobile designer, Stevens redesigned the 1962 Studebaker Gran Turismo Hawk on a minuscule budget. The fast, elegant GT remained until the end of American production. According to Hendry, Stevens also styled \\"three innovative products for family car use for the 1964-66 period\\" (which were never manufactured). He then designed Harley-Davidson motorcycles including the 1949 Hydra-Glide Harley, one of his first, helping create the new suspension forks in the front, bucket headlight, and the streamlined design. All Harleys since, including models in production now, are based on Stevens's body designs. He designed the Jeep Wagoneer, which was introduced for 1963 by Willys-Jeep. This model was so popular that it was offered in basically the same form by Jeep's subsequent owners, including Kaiser Jeep, AMC, and finally Chrysler, until 1991. Stevens designed the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, an American pop-culture icon. He designed engines for Briggs and Stratton. He also designed the university logo for the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) in 1978 as a part of \\"The Diamond Jubilee\\" celebration. The logo remains in use today. Stevens designed the post-war Skytop Lounge observation cars for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad's Hiawatha passenger trains. He also designed a series of \\"Excalibur\\" racing sports cars in conjunction with Kaiser Motors. at fibreglasssportscars.com Beginning in the mid-1960s he and his sons began production of the Excalibur, styled after the 1930s-era Mercedes roadsters. He modernized the Aero-Willys sedans that were offered in Brazil in the 1960s, and there is a very Studebaker Hawk-ish look to the body of these cars. Stevens's design contributions to the recreational boating industry included collaborations with Outboard Marine Corp. to style the Evinrude Lark and Johnson Javelin outboard motor series. He also designed the Evinrude Lark concept boat, eventually produced as the Cadillac Sea Lark. Together with Bob Hammond's 1956 Lone Star Meteor, these designs may be credited with introducing post-world war automotive styling to leisure craft.Bowen, Ezra. High-seas Hot Rods in Sports Illustrated June 17, 1957, at SI Vaults Other work in the marine industry include designs for Owens Yacht Company and Cutter Boats as well as a line of stainless steel marine hardware for the Vollrath Company. Planned obsolescence Though he is often citedGlenn Adamson and David Gordon, Industrial Strength Design: How Brooks Stevens Shaped Your World (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2003), 4-5. Retrieved 5 July 2014. with inventing the concept of planned obsolescence (the practice of artificially shortening product lifecycle in order to influence the buying patterns of consumers in favor of manufacturers), he did not invent it but rather popularized the term. Stevens defined it as \\"instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary\\". His view was to always make the consumer want something new, rather than create poor products that would need replacing. There is some debate over his role in this controversial business practice.

Barthelme also worked as a newspaper reporter for the Houston Post, was managing editor of Location magazine, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston (1961‚Äì1962), co-founder of Fiction (with Mark Mirsky and the assistance of Max and Marianne Frisch), and a professor at various universities. He also was one of the original founders of the University of Houston Creative Writing Program. Life Donald Barthelme was born in Philadelphia in 1931. His father and mother were fellow students at the University of Pennsylvania. The family moved to Texas two years later and Barthelme's father became a professor of architecture at the University of Houston, where Barthelme would later study journalism. Barthelme won a Scholastic Writing Award in Short Story in 1949, while a student at Lamar High School in Houston. In 1951, as a student, he wrote his first articles for the Houston Post. Two years later, Barthelme was drafted into the U.S. Army, arriving in Korea on July 27, 1953, the day of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which ended the Korean War. Assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, he served briefly as the editor of an Army newspaper and the Public Information Office of the Eighth Army before returning to the United States and his job at the Houston Post. Once back, he continued his studies at the University of Houston studying philosophy. Although he continued to take classes until 1957, he never received a degree. He spent much of his free time in Houston's black jazz clubs, listening to musical innovators such as Lionel Hampton and Peck Kelly, an experience that influenced his later writing. Barthelme's relationship with his father was a struggle between a rebellious son and a demanding father. In later years they would have tremendous arguments about the kinds of literature in which Barthelme was interested and which he wrote. While in many ways his father was avant-garde in art and aesthetics, he did not approve of the postmodern and deconstruction schools. Barthelme went on to teach for brief periods at Boston University, University at Buffalo, and the City College of New York, where he served as Distinguished Visiting Professor from 1974 to 1975. His brothers Frederick (born 1943) and Steven (born 1947) are also respected fiction writers. =Personal life= He married four times. His second wife, Helen Moore Barthelme, later wrote a biography entitled Donald Barthelme: The Genesis of a Cool Sound, published in 2001. With his third wife Birgit, a Dane, he had his first child, a daughter named Anne, and near the end of his life, he married Marion (Marion Knox/Barthelme d 2011), with whom he had his second daughter, Katharine. Marion and Donald remained married until his death, in 1989, from throat cancer. See also Career In 1961 Barthelme became director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston; he published his first short story the same year. His New Yorker publication, \\"L'Lapse\\", a parody of Michelangelo Antonioni's film L'Eclisse (The Eclipse), followed in 1963. The magazine would go on to publish much of Barthelme's early output, including such now-famous stories as \\"Me and Miss Mandible,\\" the tale of a 35-year-old sent to elementary school by either a clerical error, failing at his job as an insurance adjuster, and failing in his marriage. Written in October 1960, it was the first of his stories to be published.p. 90 Barthelme, Helen Moore Donald Barthelme: The Genesis of a Cool Sound Texas A&M; University Press, 1 May 2001 \\"A Shower of Gold,\\" another early short story, portrays a sculptor who agrees to appear on the existentialist game show Who Am I?. In 1964, Barthelme collected his early stories in Come Back, Dr. Caligari, for which he received considerable critical acclaim as an innovator of the short story form. His style‚Äîfictional and popular figures in absurd situations, e.g., the Batman-inspired \\"The Joker's Greatest Triumph\\"‚Äîspawned a number of imitators and would help to define the next several decades of short fiction. Barthelme continued his success in the short story form with Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts (1968). One widely anthologized story from this collection, \\"The Balloon,\\" appears to reflect on Barthelme's intentions as an artist. The narrator inflates a giant, irregular balloon over most of Manhattan, causing widely divergent reactions in the populace. Children play across its top, enjoying it literally on a surface level; adults attempt to read meaning into it but are baffled by its ever-changing shape; the authorities attempt to destroy it but fail. In the final paragraph, the reader learns that the narrator has inflated the balloon for purely personal reasons, and he sees no intrinsic meaning in the balloon itself, a metaphor for the amorphous, uncertain nature of Barthelme's fiction. Other notable stories from this collection include \\"The Indian Uprising,\\" a mad collage of a Comanche attack on a modern city, and \\"Robert Kennedy Saved From Drowning,\\" a series of vignettes showing the difficulties of truly knowing a public figure. The latter story appeared in print only two months before the real Kennedy's 1968 assassination. Barthelme would go on to write over a hundred more short stories, first collected in City Life (1970), Sadness (1972), Amateurs (1976), Great Days (1979), and Overnight to Many Distant Cities (1983). Many of these stories were later reprinted and slightly revised for the collections Sixty Stories (1981), Forty Stories (1987), and posthumously, Flying to America (2007). Though primarily known for these stories, Barthelme also produced four novels: Snow White (1967), The Dead Father (1975), Paradise (1986), and The King (1990, posthumous). Barthelme also wrote the non-fiction book Guilty Pleasures (1974). His other writings have been posthumously gathered into two collections, The Teachings of Don B.: Satires, Parodies, Fables, Illustrated Stories, and Plays of Donald Barthelme (1992) and Not-Knowing: The Essays and Interviews (1997). With his daughter, he wrote the children's book The Slightly Irregular Fire Engine, which received the 1972 National Book Award in category Children's Books. He was also a director of PEN, the Author's Guild, and a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Style and legacy Barthelme's fiction was hailed by some for being profoundly disciplined and derided by others as being meaningless, academic postmodernism.Folta, Alexander Donald Barthelme als Postmoderner Erz√§hler: Poetologie, Literatur und Gesellschaft P. Lang, 1991 Barthelme's thoughts and work were largely the result of 20th-century angstFolta as he read extensively, for example in Pascal, Husserl, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and Camus. Barthelme's stories typically avoid traditional plot structures, relying instead on a steady accumulation of seemingly unrelated detail. By subverting the reader's expectations through constant non-sequiturs, Barthelme creates a hopelessly fragmented verbal collage reminiscent of such modernist works as T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land and James Joyce's Ulysses, whose linguistic experiments he often challenged. However, Barthelme's fundamental skepticism and irony distanced him from the modernists' belief in the power of art to reconstruct society, leading most critics to class him as a postmodernist writer. Literary critics have noted that Barthelme, like St√©phane Mallarm√©, whom he admired, plays with the meanings of words, relying on poetic intuition to spark new connections of ideas buried in the expressions and conventional responses. The critic George Wicks called Barthelme \\"the leading American practitioner of surrealism today...whose fiction continues the investigations of consciousness and experiments in expression that began with Dada and surrealism a half-century ago.\\" Another critic, Jacob Appel, described him as \\"the most influential unread author in United States history.\\"Appel, Jacob. Hiding Man , Rain Taxi, Winter 2010 Barthelme has been described in many other ways, such as in an article in Harper's where Josephine Henden classified him as an angry sado- masochist. The great bulk of his work was published in The New Yorker. In 1964, he began to publish short stories collections beginning with Come Back, Dr. Caligari in 1964, followed by Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts (1968) and City Life (1970). Time magazine named City Life one of the best books of the year and described the collection as written with \\"Kafka's purity of language and some of Beckett's grim humor.\\" His formal originality can be seen in his fresh handling of the parodic dramatic monologue in \\"The School\\" or a list of one hundred numbered sentences and fragments in \\"The Glass Mountain.\\" Joyce Carol Oates commented on this sense of fragmentation in \\"Whose Side Are You On?,\\" a 1972 New York Times Book Review essay. She writes, \\"This from a writer of arguable genius whose works reflect what he himself must feel, in book after book, that his brain is all fragments...just like everything else.\\" Perhaps, the most discrete reference to this fragment comes from \\"See the Moon?\\" from Unspeakable Practices. The narrator states and repeats the phrase, \\"Fragments are the only forms I trust.\\" It is important, however, to not conflate the quote's sentiment with Barthelme's personal philosophy, as he expressed irritation over the \\"fragments\\" quote being attributed so frequently to him rather than his narrator. Another Barthelme device was breaking up a tale with illustrations culled from mostly popular 19th-century publications, collaged, and appended with ironic captions. Barthelme called his cutting up and pasting together pictures \\"a secret vice gone public.\\" One of the pieces in the collection Guilty Pleasures, \\"The Expedition,\\" featured a full-page illustration of a collision between ships, with the caption \\"Not our fault!\\" Barthelme's legacy as an educator lives on at the University of Houston, where he was one of the founders of the prestigious Creative Writing Program. At the University of Houston, Barthelme became known as a sensitive, creative, and encouraging mentor to young creative writing students even as he continued his own writings. Thomas Cobb, one of his students, published his doctoral dissertation Crazy Heart in 1987 partly basing the main character on Barthelme.The novel was made into the successful 2009 film Crazy Heart.

Influences In a 1971‚Äì72 Interview with Jerome Klinkowitz (now collected in Not-Knowing), Barthelme provides a list of favorite writers, both influential figures from the past and contemporary writers he admired. Throughout other interviews in the same collection, Barthelme reiterates a number of the same names and also mentions several others, occasionally expanding on why these writers were important for him. In a 1975 Interview for Pacifica Radio, Barthelme stresses that, for him, Beckett is foremost among his literary predecessors saying, \\"I'm enormously impressed by Beckett. I'm just overwhelmed by Beckett, as Beckett was, I speculate, by Joyce\\".Interview with Ruas and Sherman, 1975. Not-Knowing:: The Essays and Interviews of Donald Barthelme. Edited by Kim Herzinger.

While she wrote in Afrikaans, her poems have been widely translated into other languages. During the 1950s and 60s, which saw the Sharpeville Massacre, the increasingly draconian enforcement of Apartheid laws, and escalating terrorism committed both by Government security forces and by the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress, Jonker chose to affiliate herself with Cape Town's racially mixed literary bohemia. In both her poems and in newspaper interviews, Jonker angrily denounced the ruling National Party's racial policies and the increasing censorship of literature and the media. This brought her into open conflict with her father, a widely respected Member of Parliament for the ruling Party. In 1965, Jonker's turbulent and unconventional love life caused Cape Town's literary bohemia to subject her to social ostracism, which led to her depression and suicide. Even so, Jonker has reached iconic status in post-Apartheid South Africa and is often compared with Sylvia Plath and Marilyn Monroe. Family origins On both sides of the family, the ancestors of Ingrid Jonker had lived in South Africa for centuries. Her forefather on her father's side, Adolph Jonker, was the son of a plantation owner from Macassar, in the Dutch East Indies, and had emigrated to the Cape Colony during the early 18th century. Adolph Jonker became the schoolteacher and warden of the Dutch Reformed congregation at Drakenstein. In 1740, he married Maria Petronella Langeveld, the daughter of Jacobus Langveld and an unknown woman from the Cape. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 21. Ingrid's father Abraham Jonker (1905-1966), was born on 22 April 1905 on the Kalkfontein farm, in the Boshoff district of the former Orange Free State. In 1910, Abraham lost his older sister to drowning. As later recalled, \\"I wasn't five years old yet and she drowned in the Vaal River at the age of eight, on the same day that King Edward VII died, because I still remember well how all the flags were hanging half-mast when we went to fetch the little coffin in town the following day with the hooded cart -- the day my late father came to wake us at four o'clock to see Halley's Comet that was clearly visible in the sky. We all felt so awful, because my late sister's little body was still lying in the house.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 201. After graduating high school in 1922, Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 20. Jonker studied at the University of Stellenbosch between 1923 and 1930. He obtained a Bachelor's Degree, majoring in Ancient Greek and Dutch and in theology. Jonker's theological studies, were, however, more out of a desire to please his parents out of any real interest. Viljoen (2012), pages 27-28. In 1928, Jonker was awarded the theological candidates diploma with honours. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 20. According to a December 1966 article by Jack Cope in the London Magazine, Ingrid's, \\"mother, Beatrice Cilliers, came from an old Huguenot family, with generations of intellectual attainments.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 24. Even though the ancestors of the Cilliers family had left France in order to continue practicing their Calvinist religion, Ingrid's grandparents had, according to historian Louise Viljoen, an attitude towards the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa which was, \\"unconventual for the time and community of which they were a part.\\" Viljoen (2012), page 18. Ingrid's grandfather, Stephanie \\"Swart Fanie\\" (\\"Black Stevie\\") Cilliers (1872-1938), \\"was not a churchgoer and could even be suspected of religious indifference.\\" Furthermore, \\"Swart Fanie\\" sometimes treated \\"the dignified ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church with witty insouciance.\\" Ingrid's grandmother, Annie Retief Cilliers (1873-1957), was a devout woman who preferred to preach to coloured people or to attend the Apostolic Church, because they were so \\"lively and jolly\\", as Ingrid later wrote. Viljoen (2012), pages 18-19. Ingrid's sister, Anna Jonker, later wrote, \\"The one story Ingrid always wanted to hear, was how it happened that Oupa married Ouma. Ouma had been in love with Oupa's brother, but he had the habit of crowing like a rooster - and the Ouma would crow, to let us hear what it sounded like - so she decided to marry Swart Fanie. The story always ended with, 'And I used to think he wouldn't be that foolish!'\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 19. Also according to Anna Jonker, \\"Swart Fanie\\" had \\"a fiery temperament\\" and once \\"tore up the documentary proof that the English had commandeered virtually all his mules and wagons during the Anglo- Boer War and hurled them back at an English officer.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 20. Beatrice Catharina Cilliers (1905-1944), the daughter of \\"Swart Fanie\\" and Anna Cilliers, met Abraham Jonker while she was studying music at the University of Stellenbosch and married him in 1930. Viljoen (2012), page 27. After their marriage, Abraham Jonker first worked as a travelling organiser for the National Party before becoming a journalist in Cape Town for such publications as Burger, Dir Huisgenoot, Jongspan, and Suiderstern. Jonker also obtained a doctorate with honours in Afrikaans literature. He also started his own bilingual magazine, Die Monitor, which he sold himself in order to, as he put it, dedicate himself exclusively to journalism and literature. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, pages 20-21. Abraham Jonker also published novels and short story collections during the early 1930s. Louise Viljoen writes, \\"The critical response to his literary work remained lukewarm,perhaps because of his preference for the European-inspired Nuwe Saaklikheid (\\"Modern Objectivity\\") was very different from the confessional mode newly popular in Afrikaans literature at the time. Because of the sombre worldview reflected in his writing, Ingrid Jonker's Dutch biographer Henk van Woerden typecast him as a secular Calvinist and described him as an aloof, panic-stricken Puritan.\\" Viljoen (2012), page 28. There were also troubles in the Jonkers' marriage. Ingrid's half-brother, Koos Jonker, later recalled, \\"Beatrice, Ingrid's mother, suffered from hallucinations and sometimes acted irrationally - even before she left my father.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 23. By 1933, Abraham and Beatrice Jonker were part of a circle of Cape Town intellectuals who, \\"joined the old Cape traditions of discussing cultural, political, and social matters.\\" Gladstone Louw later described, \\"the writer and journalist Abraham Jonker,\\" as, \\"intelligent, but surly and then already frustrated.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 23. W.A. de Klerk later recalled, \\"I would say Ingrid's incapacity to find any happiness on a personal level should be seen in terms of her own broken home background. Her father was not an easy man. He often became violent... My wife remembers the evenings very well when Ingrid's mother fled the house with Annatije as a small child.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 25. According to Ingrid's older sister, Anna Jonker, \\"Abraham Jonker didn't chase his wife away, as the story went. She had been in Valkenberg for ten days, seven months pregnant, for her nerves. They adored each other, with a devouring love. He accused her, in a moment of jealousy, that the baby (Ingrid) might not be his. That night she left him. She was exactly thirty-four.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 24. Early life Ingrid Jonker was born on her maternal grandfather's farm near Douglas, Northern Cape, on 19 September 1933. Shortly before her birth, Ingrid's mother Beatrice and sister Anna had left Abraham Jonker's house in the Cape Town suburb of Vredehoek. Louise Viljoen (2012), Ingrid Jonker: Poet under Apartheid, Ohio University Press. Page 16. Beatrice and Anna Jonker first found refuge at the home of a neighbour, J.A. Smith. Then, mother and daughter left for the farm of Beatrice's parents, \\"Swart Fanie\\" and Anna Cilliers. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 23. Acoording to Louise Viljoen, \\"A letter survives in which Beatrice firmly rejects Abraham's plea that she return to him.\\" Louise Viljoen (2012), Ingrid Jonker: Poet under Apartheid, Ohio University Press. Page 16. Ingrid and Anna's childhood was spent on a succession of small farms owned by their grandfather. Ingrid later wrote, \\"At the time my father was not with the family and my grandfather Fanie Cilliers, a top joke teller, paralyzed and bedridden for 15 years, but the wittiest person I ever knew, ruled the house in his own exuberant way.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 19. Anna Jonker later wrote of \\"Swart Fanie,\\" \\"He had been paralyzed for many years and during his last year's he was completely bedridden. But there, in his large bedroom with doors leading onto the veranda, he entertained his friends until the pipe-smoke hung blue in the air. The loud laughing, the pranks, the stories attracted us children; Ingrid would crawl in behind Oupa's back, from where Ouma would come and fetch her when the stories got too rough.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 19. Anna further recalled, \\"Ingrid was always Ouma's child. Ouma Annie Retief, pretty Annie from Paarl, a fine slender woman with green eyes that often sparkled, but could at times look quite stern.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 19. Jonker‚Äôs grandparents moved to a farm near Durbanville. Anna later recalled, \\"It was in Durbanville, I think, that Ingrid was christened. She was three or four years old and the family was just as upset about that as about the unusual name she was given. Mama read the name in a book and that was that; as she would always say. Mama was always being different, the family used to say, and who has a child christened in a garden? Ingrid wore a pretty white dress and there were cakes and tea and many people. I was so jealous that I hid in the neighbours' garden and watched it all through the fence.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 21. As girls Ingrid and Anna were often taken to visit their grandmother's wealthy relatives, who owned vineyards in Paarl. Anna later recalled, \\"We often went to visit the family in Paarl. The oldest people we knew were Ouma's mother and aunt, while lived in Hillside in Paarl. We were overwhelmed by the grand house and quite taken aback by the degree of cleanliness expected of us. To us it felt as if we had to wash our hands a hundred times a day, and that just to be given some of the delicious food or at most two or three of the pretty little biscuits. Great- grandmother believed that girls should be little ladies. We sat on pouffres with our little ankles crossed, trying not to laugh at the funny name of the seat, while they solemnly proceeded to establish family ties.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 23. Anna also recalled of her father, \\"Abraham came to see us in Durbanville, but it upset my mother so much to see him that Oupa said he must stay away.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 26. During the same visit, Abraham brought a red top as a gift for Ingrid, but otherwise refused to acknowledge her presence. Viljoen (2012), page 25. According to Anna, \\"Then the gossip started in Stellenbosch. Ingrid never knew about it.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 26. Ingrid later wrote, \\"The house that I do remember, is the one in Durbanville, where we lived until I was about five years old. I will always remember how my laughing grandfather encouraged me to ride faster and faster on my tricycle until I fell off - and my grandmother would come and calm us down. 'Oh, Fanie, is there nothing I can do about your liveliness? Look how you're egging the child on. And she's already like a little devil.'\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 20. In 1938, her grandfather Fanie Cilliers died, leaving the four women destitute. Ingrid later recalled, \\"Then one morning when I woke up, my sister came to me and said, 'Do you know what? Oupa is dead. His room is full of wreaths.' I heard something about his death years later from Ouma: 'Babs,' (that was my nickname) 'the night your grandfather died, he called me to his bed and said, 'Annie, I love you, because you carried my burdens.'\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 20. The Strand and Gordon's Bay In the aftermath, the family moved to the Strand. Ingrid later recalled, \\"Those days the Strand was little more than a fishing village. Now I had to go to church and to Sunday school. It didn't take me long to learn the nicest hymns by heart. For me these songs contained the structure, rhythm, and mystery of poetry. Inspired by this and by my grandmother's loving care, I started writing verses. My first 'poetry' appeared in the school magazine. I was six then. Ouma recited them to the Coloured community that lived on the outskirts of the Strand, where she used to go and teach them Bible lessons after Sunday school. I still remember how hard it was for me to walk down that long dirt road,holding Ouma's hand, her jokes along the way and the glimmer in her deep green eyes when she looked down at me. She could not have been more than five feet tall herself. I would stand to one side of her pulpit in front of the Coloured community, and Ouma and I and the entire congregation would end up in tears as hymn after heart- stirring hymn was sung.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 26. Anna later recalled, \\"Ingrid and I didn't realize how poor we were. We knew Ouma had to be careful with money, and that her two sons, A.C. Cilliers of the University of Stellenbosch, and uncle Jacob, the attorney from Boksburg, sent her money every month. My father also sent a few pounds every month, and later Ouma got a pension - seventeen pounds a month, I remember. Mama was often I'll and stayed in bed for long periods, but on a few occasions she went to work for a few months at a time. Once she worked at the SABC and we teased her because she liked Gideon Roos so much.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 27. They moved later to Gordon's Bay. In 1940, Ingrid began attending kindergarten. According to Viljoen, \\"Their mother and grandmother allowed them greater freedom and mobility than was usual for the time. During their stay in Gordon's Bay, they often wandered off into a pine forest on their way to school, to sit and read their books. Once they stayed away from school for so long that that their teacher thought that the family had moved again. Here, they were also allowed to keep small animals and continued exploring the veld and beach. They picked fruit from plants in the veld, gathered shellfish from the rock pools, played with tadpoles in the stream behind their house and buried small objects called 'secrets' in the ground. It is not surprising that Gordon's Bay is one of the spaces that would later gain symbolic importance in Ingrid's poetry.\\" Viljoen (2012), pages 20-21. Anna later recalled, \\"Ingrid and I were playing on the carpet and Mama and Ouma were watching us. Ingrid looked up and I heard Mama say, 'How could he say she isn't his child? She has the same broken-hearted look in her eyes.' Ingrid was about six or seven. She never forgot those words; never spoke about it, but she must have started realising then why she was Ouma's heartache child. Many years later, during her breakdown, psychiatrists determined that she was emotionally only seven years old \\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 27. A shadow was cast over this idyllic time by the increasing mental illness of Ingrid's mother. While they lived in the flat in Gordon's Bay, Beatrice Jonker suffered a mental breakdown. Anna later recalled of her mother, \\"She went on loving Pa and never spoke ill of him, but she didn't want to see him. Once we found her at the window, tugging at a piece of string and repeating over and over, 'There comes Aben. There comes Aben.' She was taken to Valkenberg and given a sleep cure. All I remember about Ingrid on the day that Mama was suddenly not there anymore were her enormous, frightened eyes. But as usual,Ingrid said nothing, with her everything turned inwards.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 27. The trauma of this experience affected Ingrid deeply and strengthened her bond with her grandmother, who was the only person with whom she could talk to about it. Soon after her mental breakdown, Beatrice Jonker was also diagnosed with cancer. Anna later recalled, \\"She wanted to join the war effort and she had to see a doctor first. That evening she cried bitterly and Ouma, too. Then Mama did something that upset Ouma very much, but that she couldn't or wouldn't stop. Mama went to see the Catholic priests and often went to them to find out more about their religion. Ingrid feared she would go to hell, like all Roman Catholics. Ingrid and Ouma prayed and read from the Bible about the Scarlet Woman.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 34. As she lay dying, Ingrid and Anna visited their mother as often as possible. They often shared news with her about boys that they felt unable to discuss with their devout grandmother. After two years in hospital, Beatrice Jonker died of cancer on 6 August 1944. Viljoen (2012), pages 21-22. Ingrid later wrote, \\"My moeder, sterwend, was so sonnig soos 'n liewenheersbesie, so geheime, so verassend, so teer.\\" (\\"My mother, dying, was as sunny as a ladybird, so full of secrets, so surprising, so tender.\\") Viljoen (2012), page 23. Anna Jonker later recalled, \\"The four of us, Ouma, uncle A.C., Ingrid and I, buried Mama. It was raining and there were some other men in black, that Ouma said were undertakers.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 43. According to Louise Viljoen, \\"Beatrice's death brought an end to Ingrid's life within the intimacy of the maternal family.\\" Viljoen (2012), page 24. Anna Jonker later wrote, \\"Ouma was to take care of us until Pa would fetch us at the end of 1944. To us he was a complete stranger. Before his arrival he had someone ask if there was anything we needed, and we wrote asking for Bibles. Ingrid really wanted a Bible and that, together with the spinning top when she was a baby, were the only presents she received from Pa in her childhood days. Shortly before he was to come and fetch us, I wrote secretly and said we wouldn't be able to go, because we should rather stay with Ouma and go to school at Hottentots Holland or somewhere, because we didn't have smart enough clothes for the Cape.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 43. As Anna writes, however, \\"He came at the end of 1944. We got into the car, and Ingrid wouldn't let go of Ouma's hand through the open window. She sat at the back and kept looking around at Ouma's little black figure at the side of the road. The road was to lead through the grey teen years in the cold house of our stepmother, through the disillusionment of Ingrid's adult life.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 44. The House in Plumstead Until the death of their mother, Anna and Ingrid's contact with their father had been minimal. In the years since his divorce from Beatrice, Abraham Jonker had briefly remarried one Barbara Gill before his third marriage to Lulu Brewis, an author of children's books, in 1941. Viljoen (2012), page 25. Abraham's son by Lulu, Adolf Jakobus \\"Koos\\" Jonker, recalls, \\"My mother wasn't always easy. When she married my father, she was a spinster of forty-one. She taught for years with a friend - and they went to England together. There they met a new friend, who came to South Africa with them. She wasn't fond of children - and my mother herself had a similar strong streak. So we always had White governesses.\\" Meleterkamp (2012), page 41. Koos Jonker further recalls, \\"In 1944, when my father went to fetch Anna and Ingrid, the house in Rondebosch became too small for the whole family. They lodged with people for a while...\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 43. Anna elaborates, \\"Life in the city was not that hard. We lodged with people at Tamboerskloof for a few months and attended Jan van Riebeeck School. Ingrid was in primary school and I was in high school.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 44. From their boarding house, the Jonker girls could walk to their school, which stood on the slopes of Table Mountain. Metelerkamp (2012), page 45. Every Sunday, Abraham Jonker would pick his daughters up from the boarding house and bring them to spend the day with him, their step mother Lulu, and their infant brother Koos. Sometimes, Lulu would join her husband and step-daughters for the evening drive back to Tamboerskloof. During the drive, Anna and Ingrid would lean up against Lulu, who would tell them stories. Metelerkamp (2012), page 45. Anna later recalled, \\"We were pleased that she liked us and we were quite prepared to accept her as mother. We didn't want to call her Mamma, but decided on Mamie, and she understood our attitude.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 45. With six months, however, Abraham purchased a larger house in Plumstead and his daughters moved in with him permanently. Metelerkamp (2012), page 44-45. Almost immediately, Anna and Ingrid's relationship with Lulu changed. Anna Jonker later recalled, \\"One of the first things that Lulu's mother said to me was that there were very important guests coming to dinner and that Ingrid and I should eat in the kitchen. We didn't mind, because we wouldn't have been able to talk politics with the grownups in any case. We were quite happy to eat in the kitchen with the little ones, who at the time were still babies. But then she went up the stairs and said, 'We feel - we feel- you grew up in the back streets. You will put your father to shame at the table.' Ouma lived until just before Ingrid got married, but we saw very little of her. She was coming to visit us in the big house in Plumstead, for example, shortly after we had gone to live in Cape Town. But then - the night before we were to fetch Ouma - my stepmother said no, we can't fetch her, because her mother was also coming to Cape Town and there wouldn't be enough space at the table!\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 49. Mrs. Huibrecht Steenkamp later recalled, \\"I soon saw that Lulu was just the kind of stepmother I had expected her to be. They were completely deprived, those two children - Ingrid and Anna. Their father was heavily involved in politics at the time. He was a Member of Parliament and was often away from home. He really led a very busy life.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 47. According to Louise Viljoen, \\"Although Abraham Jonker has been portrayed as the archetypal Apartheid politician in the minds of those who know of the political tension that existed between him and his daughter, he had a chequered political career. In the election that brought D.F. Malan's National Party to power in 1948, he won a seat in Parliament as a member of General Smuts's United Party. Together with other dissidents he formed the Conservative Party in 1954, but crossed the floor in 1956 to join the National Party. Many of his contemporaries spoke of him as a political opportunist and a turncoat. Whether Abraham Jonker's changing political views were the result of careerism or inner conviction, they would bring him into open confrontation with his daughter.\\" Viljoen (2012), pages 28-29. According to psychologist L.M. van der Merwe, \\"Anna Jonker points out that their father was happy to have his older daughters at home with him and that he tried his best to minimise the friction between them and their stepmother. But he was often away and the girls soon noticed that their complaints only led to further friction. They started keeping quiet and their father no longer enquired.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 49. At other times, however, Abraham Jonker was complicit in his wife's mistreatment of her step-daughters. Anna later recalled, \\"They sat at the head of the table and we sat at the bottom, below the salt. When they had a leg of lamb, we ate mice. They had fruit, but we did not. They had sweets, but that we weren't allowed. They would go for Sunday drives, but there wouldn't be space for us two in the huge big car.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 50. Mrs. Steenkamp continues, \\"Lulu was nothing but a judge who constantly condemned the children. Those children were exstremely vulnerable - not so much Anna, she could stand her own ground, but Ingrid was totally vulnerable. The reason for that was that she knew Anna was the favourite.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 47. Both Anna and Ingrid were used to wandering around on their own and always speaking their minds. But, according to their stepmother's friend, Mrs. Ena de Klerk, \\"Lulu wanted to keep them at home, to protect them and shape them into a religious mold. This caused clashes between her and the girls. It was not so much that she was unfair to them, inherently Lulu Brevis was a good person. Anna and Ingrid were vagabonds, they roamed the beaches from an early age. They knew absolutely nothing about a home life.\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 47. According to Mrs. Steenkamp, however, \\"That is the kind of attitude those people had towards the children. They were raised perfectly well, for goodness sake! Their mother raised them, and she came from one of the best families in Paarl! How could they have said the children had grown up in the back streets?\\" Metelerkamp (2012), page 49. While living in Plumstead, Ingrid and Anna attended Wynberg Girls' High School, where teaching was in English rather than Afrikaans. School records reveal Ingrid to have been a well behaved but average student, who preferred to devote herself only to those subjects she liked. Her writing was praised by her teachers Viljoen (2012), page 29. and she began writing poetry for the school magazine. According to Louise Viljoen, \\"Although there was no love lost between the two girls and their stepmother, they had a good relationship with their much younger step- siblings, Koos and Suzanne.\\" Viljoen (2012), page 27. By 1951, Ingrid wanted to move out. Anna later recalled how she travelled from Johannesburg, where she was working at the time, in order to help Ingrid obtain permission to leave the house in Plumstead. After both girls explained that there was \\"space in the house, but no place in the heart\\" for them, Abraham Jonker gave Ingrid permission to move out. Anna then helped her set herself up in a boarding house in central Cape Town. Viljoen (2012), page 31. Poet Ingrid Jonker started writing poems when she was six years old and, by the age of sixteen, she submitted her first collection of poems, Na die somer (‚ÄúAfter the summer‚Äù) to Nasionale Boekhandel. The publisher did not accept it, but the company's reader, D.J. Opperman, invited Ingrid to come and discuss her poems with him. Opperman was one of the foremost poets of his time and was a hugely influential figure in Afrikaans literature. Ingrid, therefore, felt very intimidated when she first went to see him. She was heartened, however, that Opperman both took her seriously and gave her good advice. On two occasions in 1951, she again sent him poems on which Opperman both commented and urged her to send more. Viljoen (2012), page 30. According to Louise Viljoen, \\"Some of these poems (for instance Skrik and Keuse) include veiled hints at romantic longing and an awakening sexuality, often reigned in by feelings of religious guilt. It is difficult to reconstruct the inner life of the adolescent Ingrid on the basis of these poems, because the expression of feeling in them is still guarded, hemmed in by schoolgirl decorum and the writerly rhetoric of a previous generation of Afrikaans poets.\\" Viljoen (2012), pages 30-31. Many of Ingrid's close friends would later comment on the fact that she did not have the opportunity to attend university. Some blamed her father for this, while others believe that it was due to the influence of her stepmother, Lulu Jonker. It is known that, after she left her father's house, Abraham Jonker paid for Ingrid to take a secretarial course, which enabled her to support herself and become independent. Viljoen (2012), page 32. Ingrid's real passion, however, was for her vocation as a poet. She later recalled, \\"I became an office worker, but the real thing I lived for was to write.\\" Viljoen (2012), page 33. She continued sending her poems to popular magazines like Die Huisgenoot, Naweekpos, and Rooi Rose, as well as the literary journal Standpunte. As she did so, her poems became increasingly more sophisticated and polished. She also took lessons in sculpting, elocution, and acting. Viljoen (2012), page 33. According to Louise Viljoen, \\"It comes as no surprise, when one listens to tape recordings of her reading her own poetry, what impresses one is the clarity of her diction and articulation. Her voice is that of a cultured woman, calm and confident. Although she gave the impression of being vulnerable and defenseless, there must also have been a measure of resilience and determination in her character to have enabled her to overcome the deprivation of her early years and develop artistically and socially after she left her father's house.\\" Viljoen (2012), pages 33-34. Her first published book of poems, Ontvlugting (‚ÄúEscape‚Äù), was eventually published in 1956. Dissident Her father, already a writer, editor and National Party Member of Parliament, was appointed chairman of the parliamentary select committee responsible for censorship laws on art, publications and entertainment. To Abraham Jonker's embarrassment, his daughter was vehemently opposed to the censorship laws he was charged with enforcing and their political differences became public. With a speech in parliament he disowned her as his daughter. The depression caused by her father's rejection of her and by her abortion forced Ingrid to enter the Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital in 1961. Jonker's next collection of poems Rook en oker (\\"Smoke and Ochre\\") was published in 1963 after delays caused by her publishers. While the anthology was praised by most South African writers, poets and critics, it was given a cool reception by supporters of the ruling Party. Thereafter, Ingrid Jonker became known as one of the Die Sestigers, a group that also included Breyten Breytenbach, Andr√© Brink, Adam Small and Bartho Smit, who were challenging the extreme Afrikaner nationalism of the ruling National Party. Rook en oker won Jonker the ¬£1000 Afrikaanse Pers- Boekhandel (Afrikaans Press-Booksellers) Literary Award, as well as a scholarship from the Anglo American Corporation. The money helped her to realize her dream of travelling to Europe, where she went to England, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal. She asked Jack Cope to accompany her, but he refused. Jonker then asked Andr√© Brink to join her. He accepted and they went to Paris and Barcelona together. During the trip Brink decided against leaving his wife for Jonker and went back to South Africa. Jonker then cut her tour short and returned to Cape Town. Jonker had started writing a new collection of poems just before her death. A selection of these poems was published posthumously in the collection Kantelson (\\"Toppling Sun\\"). She then witnessed a shattering event: a black baby was shot by white soldiers and died in his mother‚Äôs arms. She underlined from Dylan Thomas: \\"after the first death, there is no other\\". She wrote Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga) (\\"The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)\\"). Personal life Ingrid Jonker married Pieter Venter in 1956, and their daughter Simone was born in 1957. The couple moved to Johannesburg, but three years later they separated. Jonker and her daughter then moved back to Cape Town. During the same time period she had relationships with two writers, Jack Cope and Andr√© Brink. She became pregnant and had an abortion, even though abortion was illegal in South Africa at the time.  Death During the night of 19 July 1965, Ingrid Jonker went down to the beach at Three Anchor Bay in Cape Town, walked into the sea, and committed suicide by drowning. The news of Ingrid's death shocked those who had known her. Jack Cope and Uys Krige were asked to identify the body. Afterwards, Cope wrote in his diary, \\"Darling I failed you. There is only one irreparable fault - to lack faith, to lose courage, to be smaller than one's love - I love you a million times.\\" Viljoen (2012),page 129. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 200. Anna Jonker later recalled, \\"When I got to Jack that morning, he was sitting at a table, surrounded by all the other writers - friends - and all the hatred was focused on him. They all blamed him.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 198. Andr√© Brink was in Pretoria at the time and went blind for several hours from the shock of hearing the news. Viljoen (2012), page 129. According to Marjorie Wallace, \\"Abraham Jonker, was on a hunting trip when Ingrid died. When he was eventually tracked down, he said, 'As far as I'm concerned, they can throw her back into the sea.'\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 199. However, Ingrid's half brother, Koos Jonker, insists that there is no truth to this. According to Koos, \\"My father reportedly made some heartless remark when he heard of Ingrid's death. But at the same time I was with him on a hunting trip in the Eastern Cape and I was standing next to him when the farmer's son came and told us that Ingrid had drowned. My father was very shocked. He didn't say anything except that we should leave immediately. At that stage he was on a very good footing with Ingrid. She often went to visit him in St. James.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 199. Simone was sent via aeroplane to her father and stepmother in Johannesburg and only learned of her mother's death after she arrived. Viljoen (2012), page 129. Psychologist L.M. van der Merwe has written, \\"Shortly before her death she underlined a verse by Dylan Thomas, 'After the first death, there is no other' ... Thereby she confirmed that the farewell had taken place long before 19 July 1965. But the physical deed committed that morning makes it very difficult to maintain perspective, to judge the value of her influence, because on that day a legend was born.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 204. Laurens van der Post later said about Ingrid, \\"Her suicide to me is almost like the suicide of Afrikanerdom... She was rejected by her father, her people and her lover, even Uys so self-absorbed in his own emotions... I was so horrified... By the dangers of her childlike vulnerability that I wrote to Jack Cope and begged him to come over and fetch her from Europe and offered to pay his fare... But once Jack had her, he just gave her cold pieces of his cold mind in return. He was the only person... who could have saved her. Perhaps he tried, I do not know. I may be unfair...she needed, as we all do, and some of us thank God get, a loving and understanding human heart to take us in.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 200. Ingrid's bohemian friends had originally planned a secular funeral for her, at which her poems were to be read aloud. Outraged by the idea, Abraham Jonker overruled them and took control of the arrangements. According to the newspapers, Abraham was determined to keep his daughter's funeral from becoming a place of protest against the regime. When it took place on July 22, 1965, there was no church service, but a Dutch Reformed minister, Rev. J.L. van Rooyen, officiated at the graveside. Ingrid's sister Anna boycotted the funeral in protest against the change to the arrangements. At the funeral, the mourners were divided. On one hand were the Jonker family, their friends, and a group of Special Branch Detectives. On the other were Ingrid's friends from Cape Town's literary bohemia. Viljoen (2012), pages 129-130. According to Marjorie Wallace, Lulu Jonker approached her step- daughter's friends and told them that those under banning orders would be arrested if any of Ingrid's poem's were read aloud, as that would turn the funeral into a political gathering. Jack Cope sobbed uncontrollably and had to be held back from throwing himself toward the coffin as it was lowered into the ground. After the Jonker family left, Ingrid's friends threw flowers into the grave. Cope tossed in a wreath of wild olive that he had picked on the slope above Clifton. Viljoen (2012), page 130. Andr√© Brink chose not to attend the funeral, as he felt it would turn what deserved to be a private event into a public spectacle. Viljoen (2012), pages 130-131. Following discussions after her religious funeral, Ingrid's friends held a secular funeral for her on July 25, 1965. Before more than a hundred mourners, Uys Krige spoke about Ingrid's poetry and Jan Rabie read some of her poems aloud. This time, Ingrid's sister Anna attended. Jan le Roux, a high school teacher from Riviersonderend, wished to take his students, who loved Ingrid's poetry, to the funeral. After being refused permission to attend by both the school principal and the local Dutch Reformed minister, the pupils held a private prayer service for Ingrid Jonker, at which her poems were read aloud. Viljoen (2012), page 131. After the death of his daughter, Abraham Jonker's health went into rapid decline. In October 1965, he disinherited his daughter Anna after she refused to hand Ingrid's letters to Andr√© Brink over to him. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 219. Abraham Jonker also began drinking alcohol heavily, even though doctors had warned that it could kill him. Anna Jonker later recalled, \\"He wasn't allowed to drink and he was hardly sober. After Ingrid's death he went through hell - he went through absolute hell. It was Christmas and he had thrombosis in his leg... Lulu didn't want to allow me to see him, can you believe it?! But a nurse told me later on that Abraham was calling, 'Ingrid! Ingrid!' He wouldn't stop calling her name. Then Lulu said something and my father hit her so hard that she flew right across the ward!\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 218. Abraham Jonker died of an aneurism in his aorta on January 10, 1966, just six months after the suicide of his daughter. Viljoen (2012), page 132. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 218. After his death, Koos Jonker overruled his father's will. Koos saw to it that his half-sister Anna received the inheritance to which she was originally due, as well as their father's violin and additional financial support. Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 219. Koos Jonker said, however, \\"Sometimes I wonder how someone who is seemingly so 'bad' could be elected to Parliament four times. He was well respected, not only by his constituency, but by the general public. I was privileged to have had a father like Abraham Jonker.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 218. When she was interviewed for a documentary many years later, Simone Venter acknowledged the psychological damage caused by her mother's suicide. Even so, Simone said, \\"She wanted to die. It was something she had thought about very deeply. It was her choice.\\" Viljoen (2012), page 133. Legacy =Copyright and papers= After Jonker's death, copyrights and control of her literary estate and papers were awarded to Jack Cope by the Master of the Court. He established the Ingrid Jonker Trust. He remained a trustee of the Trust until his death in 1991. Jonker's daughter Simone Venter is the beneficiary. Copyright is still vested in the Trust. Jonker's literary papers went to the National English Literary Museum (NELM) in Grahamstown. Her sister Anna Jonker borrowed these with the intention of writing a biography on her sister. November 2005. =Literary legacy= wall poem in Leiden Jonker's poetry has been translated from Afrikaans into English, German, French, Dutch, Polish, Hindi and Zulu, among others. She wrote a one-act play n Seun na my Hart (\\"A son after my heart\\") about a mother's illusions about her handicapped son. Jonker also wrote several short stories. The prestigious Ingrid Jonker Prize for the best debut work of Afrikaans or English poetry was instituted by her friends to honour her legacy after her burial in 1965. This yearly prize, consisting of R1000 and a medal, is awarded alternately to an Afrikaans or English poet who has published a first volume in the previous two years. In 1975, Afrikaner poet Breyten Breytenbach was arrested during a visit to South Africa from his home in Paris and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for high treason. In June 1977, Breytenbach was prosecuted on charges that, among other things, he had planned a submarine attack by the Soviet Navy on the prison at Robben Island through the conspiratorial \\"Okhela Organisation.\\" In the end, the judge found him guilty only of having smuggled letters and poems out of jail, for which he was fined 50 dollars. While serving his prison sentence, Breytenbach wrote the poem, Ballade van ontroue bemindes(\\"Ballade of Unfaithful Lovers\\"). Inspired by Fran√ßois Villon's Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis, Breytenbach compared Peter Blum, Ingrid Jonker, and himself to unfaithful lovers, who had betrayed Afrikaans poetry by taking leave of it. Viljoen (2012), page 136. At the opening of the first democratically elected Parliament of South Africa on 24 May 1994, Nelson Mandela praised Jonker's role as a critic of Apartheid and suggested that her suicide was an extreme protest against a nation that refused to hear her. Mandela then read Jonker's poem, Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga) (\\"The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)\\") in English translation. The poet's friend Elize Botha, however, disputes Mandela's claims about the reasons for Ingrid's suicide, \\"Her tragic death was not due to the political system of those days. In fact, she was known to be against the suppression of any ideology. Her death was preceded by a feeling of desperate loneliness and rejection on a purely human level.\\" Petrovna Metelerkamp (2012),Ingrid Jonker: A Poet's Life, page 218. In popular culture In 2001 a documentary about Jonker was produced for Dutch television by Saskia van Schaik: Korreltjie niks is my dood. In 2002 the one-woman, interactive play by Ryk Hattingh, Opdrag: Ingrid Jonker (\\"Assignment: Ingrid Jonker\\"), was staged at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival starring Jana Cilliers. The play dealt with questions and comments on Jonker‚Äôs life, interwoven with her poems and other writing. In April 2004 Jonker was posthumously awarded the Order of Ikhamanga by the South African government for \\"her excellent contribution to literature and a commitment to the struggle for human rights and democracy in South Africa.\\" In 2007 a documentary Ingrid Jonker, her Lives and Time by Mozambique-born South African film and documentary director Helena Nogueira was released in South Africa. Hailed as the definitive work on Jonker this is the first literary documentary to receive theatrical release in South Africa. A number of her poems have been set to music over the years, beginning with the song cycle Vyf liedere for soprano and piano by Stefans Grov√© (1981), and sung by such artists as Laurika Rauch, Anneli van Rooyen and Chris Chameleon. In 2003 ddisselblom, an Afrikaans pop group, released an eponymously titled CD containing the track Falkenburg, a very well executed adaptation of Jonker's \\"Ontvlugting\\". In 2005 Chris Chameleon (known better as the lead singer of the South African band Boo!) released the album Ek Herhaal Jou (\\"I Repeat You\\"), which consisted of a number of Jonker's poems that he had set to music. The release coincided with the 40th anniversary of Jonker's death. Some of Jonker's poems that inspired Chameleon's songs are Bitterbessie Dagbreek (\\"Bitterberry Daybreak\\"), Lied van die gebreekte Riete (\\"Song of the Broken Reeds\\") and Ontvlugting (\\"Escape\\"). Also, in 2007 work was already underway on a feature film about Ingrid Jonker with the working title All that Breaks. Based on a script by Helena Nogueira workshopped at Johannesburg's Market Theatre, the film focusses on three years in the life of Jonker and the Sestigers who gathered around poet Uys Krige at Clifton in Cape Town. The film is produced by David Parfitt (Shakespeare in Love), Charles Moore (Schindler's List) and Shan Moodley and is directed by Nogueira. In 2011, Dutch actress Carice van Houten played Ingrid Jonker in the biopic Black Butterflies, directed by Paula van der Oest. The film also starred Irish actor Liam Cunningham as Jack Cope and Rutger Hauer as Abraham Jonker. Despite being a fully Dutch production about a poet who spoke and wrote in Afrikaans, Black Butterflies was filmed entirely in English. Also in 2011, South African musician Chris Chameleon released an album of Jonker's works, entitled As Jy Weer Skryf (\\"If You Write Again\\"). In 2012, Nicola Haskins choreographed a dance drama which told the life story of Jonker for the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and then later to be performed at various venues including the University of Pretoria. Biography Jonker's biographer is Petrovna Metelerkamp, who published Ingrid Jonker ‚Äì Beeld van 'n digterslewe (\\"Ingrid Jonker ‚Äì Image of a Poet's Life\\") in 2003. This book contains new insights into the poet's life, and includes love letters (some unsent) and an as yet unpublished account of the night of Jonker's death by her friend, Bonnie Davidtsz. The proceeds of the book are said to assist Simone Venter (Jonker's daughter) financially. An English, updated version of this biography appeared in 2012: Ingrid Jonker - A Poet's Life.

The companies held by Nikon form the Nikon Group. West Building of Nikon in Nishi-≈åi, Tokyo Nikon's products include cameras, camera lenses, binoculars, microscopes, ophthalmic lenses, measurement instruments, rifle scopes, spotting scopes, and the steppers used in the photolithography steps of semiconductor fabrication, of which it is the world's second largest manufacturer. The company is the eighth-largest chip equipment maker as reported in 2017. Also, it has diversified into new areas like 3D printing and regenerative medicine to compensate for the negative impacts from shrinking digital camera market. Among Nikon's notable product lines are Nikkor imaging lenses (for F-mount cameras, large format photography, photographic enlargers, and other applications), the Nikon F-series of 35 mm film SLR cameras, the Nikon D-series of digital SLR cameras, the Coolpix series of compact digital cameras, and the Nikonos series of underwater film cameras. Nikon's main competitors in camera and lens manufacturing include Canon, Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, Pentax, and Olympus. Founded on July 25, 1917 as Nippon K≈çgaku K≈çgy≈ç Kabushikigaisha ( \\"Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd.\\"), the company was renamed to Nikon Corporation, after its cameras, in 1988. Nikon is a member of the Mitsubishi group of companies (keiretsu). History Nikon Corporation was established on 25 July 1917 when three leading optical manufacturers merged to form a comprehensive, fully integrated optical company known as Nippon K≈çgaku T≈çky≈ç K.K. Over the next sixty years, this growing company became a manufacturer of optical lenses (including those for the first Canon cameras) and equipment used in cameras, binoculars, microscopes and inspection equipment. During World War II the company operated thirty factories with 2,000 employees, manufacturing binoculars, lenses, bomb sights, and periscopes for the Japanese military. =Reception outside Japan= After the war Nippon K≈çgaku reverted to producing its civilian product range in a single factory. In 1948, the first Nikon-branded camera was released, the Nikon I. Nikon lenses were popularised by the American photojournalist David Douglas Duncan. Duncan was working in Tokyo when the Korean War began. Duncan had met a young Japanese photographer, Jun Miki, who introduced Duncan to Nikon lenses. From July 1950 to January 1951, Duncan covered the Korean War. Fitting Nikon optics (especially the NIKKOR-P.C 1:2 f=8,5 cm)In German: Peter Braczko, Nikon Faszination, Geschichte ‚Äì Technik ‚Äì Mythos von 1917 bis heute, H√ºckelhoven 1992, , S. 27ff und Tafel 2. to his Leica rangefinder cameras produced high contrast negatives with very sharp resolution at the centre field. =Names and brands= Nikko parent company brand, from which the Nikkor brand evolved. Founded in 1917 as Nippon K≈çgaku K≈çgy≈ç Kabushikigaisha ( \\"Japan Optical Industries Corporation\\"), the company was renamed Nikon Corporation, after its cameras, in 1988. The name Nikon, which dates from 1946, was originally intended only for its small-camera line, spelled as \\"Nikkon\\", with an addition of the \\"n\\" to the \\"Nikko\\" brand name.https://www.nikon.com/about/corporate/history/chronology/1946/index.htm The similarity to the Carl Zeiss AG brand \\"ikon\\", would cause some early problems in Germany as Zeiss complained that Nikon violated its trademarked camera. From 1963 to 1968 the Nikon F in particular was therefore labeled 'Nikkor'. The Nikkor brand was introduced in 1932, a westernised rendering of an earlier version Nikk≈ç (), an abbreviation of the company's original full name (Nikk≈ç coincidentally means \\"sunlight\\" and is the name of a Japanese town.). Nikkor is the Nikon brand name for its lenses. Another early brand used on microscopes was Joico, an abbreviation of \\"Japan Optical Industries Co\\". Expeed is the brand Nikon uses for its image processors since 2007. =Rise of the Nikon F series= Nikon F FTN Camera The Nikon SP and other 1950s and 1960s rangefinder cameras competed directly with models from Leica and Zeiss. However, the company quickly ceased developing its rangefinder line to focus its efforts on the Nikon F single-lens reflex line of cameras, which was successful upon its introduction in 1959. For nearly 30 years, Nikon's F-series SLRs were the most widely used small-format cameras among professional photographers, as well as by the U.S. space program. Nikon popularized many features in professional SLR photography, such as the modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, viewfinders, motor drives, and data backs; integrated light metering and lens indexing; electronic strobe flashguns instead of expendable flashbulbs; electronic shutter control; evaluative multi-zone \\"matrix\\" metering; and built-in motorized film advance. However, as auto focus SLRs became available from Minolta and others in the mid-1980s, Nikon's line of manual-focus cameras began to seem out of date. Despite introducing one of the first autofocus models, the slow and bulky F3AF, the company's determination to maintain lens compatibility with its F-mount prevented rapid advances in autofocus technology. Canon introduced a new type of lens-camera interface with its entirely electronic Canon EOS cameras and Canon EF lens mount in 1987. The much faster lens performance permitted by Canon's electronic focusing and aperture control prompted many professional photographers (especially in sports and news) to switch to the Canon system through the 1990s. =Digital photography= Nikon NASA F4 front view with DA-20 action finder, Electronics Box and lenses. Launched September 1991 on board the Space Shuttle Discovery, mission STS-48. Nikon created some of the first digital SLRs (DSLRs, Nikon NASA F4) for NASA, used in the Space Shuttle since 1991. After a 1990s partnership with Kodak to produce digital SLR cameras based on existing Nikon film bodies, Nikon released the Nikon D1 SLR under its own name in 1999. Although it used an APS-C-size light sensor only 2/3 the size of a 35 mm film frame (later called a \\"DX sensor\\"), the D1 was among the first digital cameras to have sufficient image quality and a low enough price for some professionals (particularly photojournalists and sports photographers) to use it as a replacement for a film SLR. The company also has a Coolpix line which grew as consumer digital photography became increasingly prevalent through the early 2000s. Nikon also never made any phones. Through the mid-2000s, Nikon's line of professional and enthusiast DSLRs and lenses including their back compatible AF-S lens line remained in second place behind Canon in SLR camera sales, and Canon had several years' lead in producing professional DSLRs with light sensors as large as traditional 35 mm film frames. All Nikon DSLRs from 1999 to 2007, by contrast, used the smaller DX size sensor. Then, 2005 management changes at Nikon led to new camera designs such as the full-frame Nikon D3 in late 2007, the Nikon D700 a few months later, and mid-range SLRs. Nikon regained much of its reputation among professional and amateur enthusiast photographers as a leading innovator in the field, especially because of the speed, ergonomics, and low-light performance of its latest models. The mid-range Nikon D90, introduced in 2008, was also the first SLR camera to record video. Since then video mode has been introduced to many more of the Nikon DSLR cameras including the Nikon D3S, Nikon D7000, Nikon D5100, Nikon D3100, Nikon D3200 and Nikon D5100. More recently, Nikon has released a photograph and video editing suite called ViewNX to browse, edit, merge and share images and videos. Despite the market growth of Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras, Nikon does not neglect their F-mount Single Lens Reflex cameras and have released some Professional DSLRs like the D780, or the D6 recently (Q1 2020). In reaction to the growing market for Mirrorless cameras, Nikon released their first Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras and also a new lens mount in 2011. The lens mount was called Nikon 1, and the first bodies in it were the Nikon 1 J1 and the V1. The systuem was built around a 1 inch (or CX) format image sensor, with a 2.7x crop factor. This format was pretty small compared to their competitors. This resulted in a loss of image quality, dynamic range and also a wider depth of field range. Probably this is the reason why it never became really successful so in 2018 Nikon officially discontinued it, after three years without a new camera body. (The last one was the Nikon 1 J5). Also in 2018, Nikon introduced a whole new mirrorless system in their lineup. It was the Nikon Z system. The first cameras it used were the Z 6 and the Z 7, both with a Full Frame (FX) sensor format, In-Body Image Stabilization and a built-in electroinic viewfinder. The Z-mount is not only for FX cameras though, as in 2019 Nikon introduced the Z 50 with a DX format sensor, without IBIS but with the compatibility to every Z-mount lens. The handling, the ergonomics and the button layout are similar to the Nikon DSLR cameras, which is friendly for those who are switching from them. This shows that Nikon is putting their focus more on their MILC line. =Film camera production= Once Nikon introduced affordable consumer-level DSLRs such as the Nikon D70 in the mid-2000s, sales of its consumer and professional film cameras fell rapidly, following the general trend in the industry. In January 2006, Nikon announced it would stop making most of its film camera models and all of its large format lenses, and focus on digital models. Nevertheless, Nikon is the only major camera manufacturer still making film SLRs. Both the high-end Nikon F6 and the entry-level FM10 (the sole remaining models following the 2006 discontinuations) remain a part of Nikon's current lineup . =Movie camera production= Although few models were introduced, Nikon made movie cameras as well. The R10 and R8 SUPER ZOOM Super 8 models (introduced in 1973) were the top of the line and last attempt for the amateur movie field. The cameras had a special gate and claw system to improve image steadiness and overcome a major drawback of Super 8 cartridge design. The R10 model has a high speed 10X macro zoom lens. Contrary to other brands, Nikon never attempted to offer projectors or their accessories. =Thai operations= Nikon has shifted much of its manufacturing facilities to Thailand, with some production (especially of Coolpix cameras and some low-end lenses) in Indonesia. The company constructed a factory in Ayuthaya north of Bangkok in Thailand in 1991. By the year 2000, it had 2,000 employees. Steady growth over the next few years and an increase of floor space from the original 19,400 square meters (208,827 square feet) to 46,200 square meters (497,300 square feet) enabled the factory to produce a wider range of Nikon products. By 2004, it had more than 8,000 workers. The range of the products produced at Nikon Thailand include plastic molding, optical parts, painting, printing, metal processing, plating, spherical lens process, aspherical lens process, prism process, electrical and electronic mounting process, silent wave motor and autofocus unit production. As of 2009, all of Nikon's Nikon DX format DSLR cameras and the D600, a prosumer FX camera, are produced in Thailand, while their professional and semi-professional Nikon FX format (full frame) cameras (D700, D3, D3S, D3X, D4, D800 and the retro-styled Df) are built in Japan, in the city of Sendai. The Thai facility also produces most of Nikon's digital \\"DX\\" zoom lenses, as well as numerous other lenses in the Nikkor line. =Nikon-Essilor Co. Ltd.= In 1999, Nikon and Essilor have signed a Memorandum of understanding to form a global strategic alliance in corrective lenses by forming a 50/50 joint venture in Japan to be called Nikon-Essilor Co. Ltd. The main purpose of the joint venture is to further strengthen the corrective lens business of both companies. This will be achieved through the integrated strengths of Nikon's strong brand backed up by advanced optical technology and strong sales network in Japanese market, coupled with the high productivity and worldwide marketing and sales network of Essilor, the world leader in this industry. Nikon-Essilor Co. Ltd. started its business in January 2000, responsible for research, development, production and sales mainly for ophthalmic optics. Recent development Revenue from Nikon's camera business has dropped 30% in three years prior to fiscal 2015. In 2013, it forecast the first drop in sales from interchangeable lens cameras since Nikon's first digital SLR in 1999. The company's net profit has fallen from a peak of 75.4 billion (fiscal 2007) to 18.2 billion for fiscal 2015. Nikon plans to reassign over 1,500 employees resulting in job cuts of 1,000, mainly in semiconductor lithography and camera business, by 2017 as the company shifts focus to medical and industrial devices business for growth. Film cameras In January 2006 Nikon announced the discontinuation of all but two models of its film cameras, focusing its efforts on the digital camera market. It continues to sell the fully manual FM10, and still offers the high-end fully automatic F6.Nikon  Imaging Products  Film SLR Cameras. Imaging.nikon.com.

Nikon first started by naming the cameras with a series name (like the L35/L135-series, the RF/RD- series, the W35-series, the EF or the AW-series). In later production cycles, the cameras were double branded with a series-name on the one and a sales name on the other hand. Sales names were for example Zoom-Touch for cameras with a wide zoom range, Lite-Touch for ultra compact models, Fun-Touch for easy to use cameras and Sport-Touch for splash water resistance. After the late 1990s, Nikon dropped the series names and continued only with the sales name. Nikon's APS-cameras were all named Nuvis. The cameras came in all price ranges from entry-level fixed-lens-cameras to the top model Nikon 35Ti and 28Ti with titanium body and 3D-Matrix-Metering. =Movie cameras= : Double 8 (8mm) * NIKKOREX 8 (1960) * NIKKOREX 8F (1963) : Super 8 * Nikon Super Zoom 8 (1966) * Nikon 8X Super Zoom (1967) * Nikon R8 Super Zoom (1973) * Nikon R10 Super Zoom (1973) =Professional Underwater cameras= * Nikonos I Calypso (1963, originally known in France as the Calypso/Nikkor) * Nikonos II (1968) * Nikonos III (1975) * Nikonos IV-A (1980) * Nikonos V (1984) * Nikonos RS (1992)Nikonos underwater camera models.

Prior to the development of 'cool' LED lighting this scanner used a halogen lamp (hence the name 'Coolscan' for the following models). The resolution of the following LED based Coolscan model didn't increase but the price was significantly lower. Colour depth, scan quality, imaging and hardware functionality as well as scanning speed was gradually improved with each following model. The final 'top of the line' 35mm Coolscan LS-5000 ED was a device capable of archiving greater numbers of slides; 50 framed slides or 40 images on film roll. It could scan all these in one batch using special adapters. A single maximum resolution scan was performed in no more than 20 seconds as long as no post- processing was also performed. With the launch of the Coolscan 9000 ED Nikon introduced its most up-to-date film scanner which, like the Minolta Dimage scanners were the only film scanners that, due to a special version of Digital ICE, were able to scan Kodachrome film reliably both dust and scratch free. In late 2007 much of the software's code had to be rewritten to make it Mac OS 10.5 compatible. Nikon announced it would discontinue supporting its Nikon Scan software for the Macintosh as well as for Windows Vista 64-bit. Third- party software solutions like SilverFast or Vuescan provide alternatives to the official Nikon drivers and scanning software, and maintain updated drivers for most current operating systems. Between 1994 and 1996 Nikon developed three flatbed scanner models named Scantouch, which couldn't keep up with competitive flatbed products and were hence discontinued to allow Nikon to focus on its dedicated film scanners.

Products include Optical Laser Probes, X-ray computed tomography, Coordinate-measuring machine (CMM),Laser Radar Systems (LR), Microscopes, Portable CMMs, Large Volume Metrology, Motion Measurement and Adaptive Robotic Controls, Semiconductor Systems, Metrology Software including CMM-Manager, CAMIO Studio, Inspect-X, Focus, and Automeasure. Measurements are performed using tactile and non-contact probes, measurement data is collected in software and processed for comparison to nominal CAD (Computer-aided design) or part specification or for recreating / reverse engineering physical work pieces. =Origins= The origins of Nikon go back to 1917 when three Jananese optical manufacturers joined to form Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics'). In 1925 the microscope having revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives was produced. Significant growth for the microscopy division occurs over the next 50 years as Nikon pioneers development of polarising and stereo microscopes along with new products for measuring and inspection (Metrology) markets. These new products include devices targeted for industrial use such as optical comparators, autocollimators, profile projector and automated vision based systems. Continued effort through the next three decades yield the release of products including the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes, Diaphot microscope, the Eclipse range of infinity optics, and finally the DS camera series and the Coolscope with the advent of digital sensors. With the acquisition of Metris in 2009 the Nikon Metrology division was born. Nikon Metrology products include a full range of both 2D & 3D, optical, tactile, non-contact, and X-Ray Metrology solutions ranging from nanometer resolution on microscopic samples to Œºm resolution in volumes large enough to house a commercial airliner. =Products= * Coordinate-Measuring- Machines ** Bridge, Gantry and Horizontal Arm CMMs ** Digital / Analog Tactile and / or Non-Contact Optical sensors * Portable arms ‚Äì 6 and 7 axis models * Laser Scanning ‚Äì Optical Line Scanners in single Line and Multi-line (Cross Scanner) configurations * X-ray-and-CT-Inspection * Video-Microscope-Measuring ‚Äì Optical Probe and Multi-Sensor options available * Microscope-Systems * Large Volume Systems * Application Software ‚Äì several options available depending on specific application and hardware. ** CMM-Manager ‚Äì Multi-sensor 3D Metrology software for third party CMMs, Articulated Arms, and Nikon video- measurement systems ** Automeasure, NIS Elements, E-Max, Automeasure Eyes ‚Äì 2D / 3D imaging software for use on Nikon video-measurement systems ** Focus, CMM-Manager, CAMIO ‚Äì Software for 3D Metrology  Lithography equipment  =Overview= Nikon manufactures scanners and steppers for the manufacture of integrated circuits and flat panel displays, and semiconductor device inspection equipment. The steppers and scanners represent about one third of the income for the company as of 2008. Nikon developed the first lithography equipment from Japan. The equipment from Nikon enjoyed high demand from global chipmakers, the Japanese semiconductor companies and other major companies such as Intel, and Nikon was the world's leading producer of semiconductor lithography systems from the 1980s to 2002. Nikon saw a sharp drop in its market share from less than 40 percent in early 2000s to no more than 20 percent as of 2013. The company has been losing an estimated 17 billion a year in its precision instruments unit. In contrast, ASML, a Dutch company, has grabbed over 80 percent of the lithography systems market as of 2015 by adopting an open innovation method of product development, which includes the acquisition of U.S-based light source manufacturer Cymer. In 2017, Nikon announced that it would cut nearly 1,000 jobs mainly in the lithography systems business and halt its development of next-generation equipment. =Legal disputes= In February 2019, Nikon, ASML and Carl Zeiss AG, a leading supplier to ASML, have entered into a definitive settlement and cross- license agreement relating to multiple disputes over patents for lithography equipment that had been underway since 2001 and agreed to drop all the world- wide lawsuits regarding the issue. By the latest settlement, ASML and Zeiss paid approximately $170 million to Nikon. The two companies had paid a total of $87 million to Nikon in 2004 for similar legal dispute. = Market position and products = As of February 2018, Nikon held 10.3 percent revenue share in the semiconductor lithography market while the share of ASML was over 80 percent. As of 2019, Nikon develops and sells the following lithography- related equipment: *Cutting-edge flat panel display lithography equipment (The FX series) *i-line steppers *Krf steppers *Arf steppers *Arf immersion steppers *Inspection and alignment equipment Other products Nikon also manufactures eyeglasses, sunglasses, and glasses frames, under the brands Nikon, Niji, Nobili-Ti, Presio, and Velociti VTI. Other Nikon's products include ophthalmic equipment, loupes, monoculars, binocular telescopes, metal 3D printers, material processing equipment, regenerative medicine contract manufacturing, cell sorting equipment, and cell culture observation systems. Nikon no longer manufactures its own image sensors as it outsources the manufacturing to Sony. Since 2019, Sendai Nikon, a Nikon group company, manufactures Lidar sensors for Velodyne as part of a partnership between the two companies. Sponsorship =Awards and exhibitions= Inside the Nikon Salon In Japan, Nikon runs the Nikon Salon exhibition spaces, runs the Nikkor Club for amateur photographers (to whom it distributes the series of Nikon Salon books), and arranges the Ina Nobuo Award, Miki Jun Award and Miki Jun Inspiration Awards. =Others= As of November 19, 2013, Nikon is the \\"Official Camera\\" of Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort. Nikon is the official co-sponsor of Galatasaray SK Football Team. In 2014 Nikon sponsored the Copa Sadia do Brasil 2014 and the AFC Champions League. The company sponsors the Nikon-Walkley Press Photographer of the Year award, as well as the Nikon Photography Prizes, which are administered by the Walkley Foundation in Australia.

It was manufactured by Nikon Corporation in Japan, on small- volume assembly lines, from 2001 to 2006. The camera was available in two colours: all black and satin chrome. The introductory US list price for the chrome body only (no lens) was $820. The FM3A was the successor to the renowned Nikon FM2N camera of 1984 and was the last member of the successful, semi-professional line of Nikon compact 35 mm film SLRs. The other members were the Nikon FM (released 1977), FE (1978), FM2 (1982) and FE2 (1983). They (and the Nikon FA) all used the superficially similar (but not identical) rugged copper-aluminium alloy chassis and high-quality Nikon vertical bearing- mounted metal shutter and ball-bearing mounted film advance, but with improved feature levels, minor external controls and cosmetic differences. The newer low-budget Nikon FM10 and FE10, while named similarly, are completely different introductory-level cameras manufactured by Cosina. The major improvements in the FM3A compared to the FM2N are the hybrid electro- mechanically controlled aluminium-bladed focal plane shutter, the aperture priority auto-exposure mode, the match-needle exposure control system and provision for through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation. In other words, the FM3A merged the robust mechanical systems of the FM2N with the proven, reliable electronic exposure controls of the FE2.  Features  The FM3a is built to a high level of workmanship and material quality. It shares the advantages of the FM and the FM2N, both generally regarded as two of the most reliable cameras ever built (both in terms of operation under extreme conditions and in day-to-day reliability reports from repair shops and magazine surveys). It has an extremely strong body of copper silumin alloy. The electronics are well protected within the body and of extremely high quality, including the flexible circuits. The FM3A's film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings. The vertical metal shutter utilises precision tapered high-strength aluminium alloy blades and oilless self- lubricating bearings. The guide rails are made of stainless steel. The mirror is made of titanium. It is large to reduce chances of vignetting with super- telephotos of up to 800 mm, and uses the same mechanism found on Nikon's pro F2, with some improvements designed to further reduce effects of vibration and mirror bounce. The FM3A accepts all of the Nikkor lenses with the Nikon F bayonet mount that support the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (AI, AIS), first introduced in 1977. The chrome FM3A was often sold in a kit that includes a color coordinated chrome finished Nikkor 45 mm f/2.8P lens. This special flat \\"pancake\\" lens was manually focused on the FM3A, but contained a CPU which could communicate focal distance to Nikon's later autofocus (AF) camera bodies. Other accessories for the FM3A include the Nikon MD-12 motor drive (automatic film advance up to 3.2 frames per second), as well as the Nikon MF-16 databack (sequential numbering, time or date stamping on the film), and the various compatible Nikon TTL flashes (SB-15, SB-16b, SB-20, etc.) In manual mode, the camera is completely mechanical in operation, and only requires batteries for the light metering information system. In aperture priority mode, the batteries continued to power the meter, but are also utilized for shutter timing and the exposure control electronics. The FM3A's metering information system consisted of a match-needle system using two needles pointing along a vertical shutter speed scale on the left side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40% centerweighted silicon photodiode light meter versus the actual camera settings. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (Nikomat EL in Japan) of 1972. The viewfinder also has Nikon's fully interchangeable bright focus screen with various options for focus.  Design history  During the mid-1990s, a demand arose among some photographers for a quality manual-focus alternative to the 35 mm autofocus SLR camera. These cameras required complex computer and processing mechanisms, and especially in their amateur and consumer versions, were known for neither their ruggedness nor a long service life. Nikon owners began to demand a durable, precision-made camera with the AE electronic features and prized construction of the discontinued Nikon FE2, which had begun to skyrocket in value on the secondhand market. Nikon responded to this phenomenon with a revival of their classic FM/FE series design. The FM3A's expensive construction and conservative design were not intended to appeal to the consumer-level market. Nikon instead marketed the camera to serious amateur and professional photographers who were desirous of the highest possible quality and precision of control, and a service life estimated not in years, but decades. The FM3A's introduction coincided with a major technological revolution in photographic technology ‚Äì digital imaging. Many photographers, professional and amateur alike, switched to digital, resulting in a huge decrease in film SLR sales. By 2004, annual sales of digital cameras had surpassed those of film cameras. Though FM3A sales remained steady, they were minuscule in volume compared to Nikon's other cameras, and steadily increasing costs forced Nikon to announce the discontinuation of the FM3A on 11 January 2006, leaving only the expensive and heavily electronic Nikon F6 and the inexpensively built Nikon FM10 in Nikon's 35mm film SLR line. Since the announcement of the FM3A's discontinuance, value on the secondhand market of the FM3A camera (and its FM2 predecessors) appreciably increased, this is especially true of the black model. As of 2014, the price for a Mint or Near Mint FM3A are as high as the new price (around 800 - 900 Euro in 2001). This makes this camera to be one of the most price-stable 35mm SLRs.

She made her Olympic debut in 2000 but was eliminated in the first round of the women's individual competition by Anna Karaseva of Belarus. Gallardo entered the 2004 Summer Olympics as Spain's sole representative in the women's individual event. She began the event with a score of 631 points from a maximum of 720 in the 72-arrow ranking round, earning her the 24th seed for the subsequent elimination rounds. Victories over Georgia's Khatuna Narimanidze and Jasmin Figueroa of the Philippines saw her advance to the last sixteen, where after a poor start she was defeated by Greece's Evangelia Psarra by eight points over eighteen arrows. Although Spanish newspaper El Pais was critical of her performance, stating that she failed to live up to expectations, Gallardo afterwards expressed satisfaction with her result. In the event's final classification, she was placed thirteenth of the sixty-four competing archers.

The identity is named after Alexandre-Th√©ophile Vandermonde (1772), although it was already known in 1303 by the Chinese mathematician Zhu Shijie.See for the history. There is a q-analog to this theorem called the q-Vandermonde identity. Vandermonde's identity can be generalized in numerous ways, including to the identity : { n_1+\\\\dots +n_p \\\\choose m }= \\\\sum_{k_1+\\\\cdots +k_p = m} {n_1\\\\choose k_1} {n_2\\\\choose k_2} \\\\cdots {n_p\\\\choose k_p}.  Proofs  = Algebraic proof = In general, the product of two polynomials with degrees m and n, respectively, is given by :\\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{i=0}^m a_ix^i\\\\biggr) \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{j=0}^n b_jx^j\\\\biggr) = \\\\sum_{r=0}^{m+n}\\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{k=0}^r a_k b_{r-k}\\\\biggr) x^r, where we use the convention that ai = 0 for all integers i > m and bj = 0 for all integers j > n. By the binomial theorem, :(1+x)^{m+n} = \\\\sum_{r=0}^{m+n} {m+n \\\\choose r}x^r. Using the binomial theorem also for the exponents m and n, and then the above formula for the product of polynomials, we obtain :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{r=0}^{m+n} {m+n \\\\choose r}x^r &= (1+x)^{m+n} &= (1+x)^m (1+x)^n  &= \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{i=0}^m {m\\\\choose i}x^i\\\\biggr) \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{j=0}^n {n\\\\choose j}x^j\\\\biggr) &=\\\\sum_{r=0}^{m+n}\\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{k=0}^r {m\\\\choose k} {n\\\\choose r-k}\\\\biggr) x^r, \\\\end{align} where the above convention for the coefficients of the polynomials agrees with the definition of the binomial coefficients, because both give zero for all i > m and j > n, respectively. By comparing coefficients of xr, Vandermonde's identity follows for all integers r with 0 ‚â§ r ‚â§ m + n. For larger integers r, both sides of Vandermonde's identity are zero due to the definition of binomial coefficients. = Combinatorial proof = Vandermonde's identity also admits a combinatorial double counting proof, as follows. Suppose a committee consists of m men and n women. In how many ways can a subcommittee of r members be formed? The answer is :{m+n \\\\choose r}. The answer is also the sum over all possible values of k, of the number of subcommittees consisting of k men and r ‚àí k women: :\\\\sum_{k=0}^r{m \\\\choose k}{n \\\\choose r-k}. = Geometrical proof = Take a rectangular grid of r x (m+n‚àír) squares. There are : \\\\binom{r+(m+n-r)}{r}=\\\\binom{m+n}{r} paths that start on the bottom left vertex and, moving only upwards or rightwards, end at the top right vertex (this is because r right moves and m+n-r up moves must be made (or vice versa) in any order, and the total path length is m + n). Call the bottom left vertex (0, 0). There are \\\\binom{m}{k} paths starting at (0, 0) that end at (k, m‚àík), as k right moves and m‚àík upward moves must be made (and the path length is m). Similarly, there are \\\\binom{n}{r-k} paths starting at (k, m‚àík) that end at (r, m+n‚àír), as a total of r‚àík right moves and (m+n‚àír) ‚àí (m‚àík) upward moves must be made and the path length must be r‚àík + (m+n‚àír) ‚àí (m‚àík) = n. Thus there are : \\\\binom{m}{k}\\\\binom{n}{r-k} paths that start at (0, 0), end at (r, m+n‚àír), and go through (k, m‚àík). This is a subset of all paths that start at (0, 0) and end at (r, m+n‚àír), so sum from k = 0 to k = r (as the point (k, m‚àík) is confined to be within the square) to obtain the total number of paths that start at (0, 0) and end at (r, m+n‚àír).  Generalizations  = Generalized Vandermonde's identity = One can generalize Vandermonde's identity as follows: : \\\\sum_{k_1+\\\\cdots +k_p = m} {n_1\\\\choose k_1} {n_2\\\\choose k_2} \\\\cdots {n_p\\\\choose k_p} = { n_1+\\\\dots +n_p \\\\choose m }. This identity can be obtained through the algebraic derivation above when more than two polynomials are used, or through a simple double counting argument. On the one hand, one chooses \\\\textstyle k_1 elements out of a first set of \\\\textstyle n_1 elements; then \\\\textstyle k_2 out of another set, and so on, through \\\\textstyle p such sets, until a total of \\\\textstyle m elements have been chosen from the \\\\textstyle p sets. One therefore chooses \\\\textstyle m elements out of \\\\textstyle n_1+\\\\dots +n_p in the left-hand side, which is also exactly what is done in the right-hand side. =Chu-Vandermonde identity= The identity generalizes to non-integer arguments. In this case, it is known as the Chu-Vandermonde identity (see Askey 1975, pp. 59-60) and takes the form :{s+t \\\\choose n}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n {s \\\\choose k}{t \\\\choose n-k} for general complex-valued s and t and any non-negative integer n. It can be proved along the lines of the algebraic proof above by multiplying the binomial series for (1+x)^s and (1+x)^t and comparing terms with the binomial series for (1+x)^{s+t}. This identity may be rewritten in terms of the falling Pochhammer symbols as :(s+t)_n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\\\choose k} (s)_k (t)_{n-k} in which form it is clearly recognizable as an umbral variant of the binomial theorem (for more on umbral variants of the binomial theorem, see binomial type). The Chu-Vandermonde identity can also be seen to be a special case of Gauss's hypergeometric theorem, which states that :\\\\;_2F_1(a,b;c;1) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(c)\\\\Gamma(c-a-b)}{\\\\Gamma(c-a)\\\\Gamma(c-b)} where \\\\;_2F_1 is the hypergeometric function and \\\\Gamma(n+1)=n! is the gamma function. One regains the Chu-Vandermonde identity by taking a = ‚àín and applying the identity :{n\\\\choose k} = (-1)^k {k-n-1 \\\\choose k} liberally. The Rothe‚ÄìHagen identity is a further generalization of this identity. The hypergeometric probability distribution When both sides have been divided by the expression on the left, so that the sum is 1, then the terms of the sum may be interpreted as probabilities. The resulting probability distribution is the hypergeometric distribution. That is the probability distribution of the number of red marbles in r draws without replacement from an urn containing n red and m blue marbles.

The hour-long show aired live on evenings every weekday, and was replayed in the overnight/early morning hours. It covered the major news stories of the day with a focus on politics and economics. Field correspondents provided additional reporting and occasionally served as guest anchors. During Dobbs' tenure, notable politicians and economists were often guests on the show. On November 11, 2009, Dobbs announced that he would be leaving CNN effective immediately. CNN anchor John King replaced the outgoing Dobbs beginning on March 22, 2010 with his new show John King, USA. Dobbs was eventually hired by Fox Business Network, which re- launched Lou Dobbs Tonight in March 2011.Fox Business Officially Slates ‚ÄòLou Dobbs Tonight‚Äô, TVNewser, 3 March 2011 History Luther Strange on Lou Dobbs Tonight in May 2017 Lou Dobbs Tonight began with the name Moneyline with the premiere of CNN, and was CNN's main financial show for over 20 years, for a large portion of those years airing on CNN International as well. In late 1997 Dobbs hired former ABC News and NBC News Executive Producer David Bohrman to turn the program into a more general evening newscast, which would be called The Moneyline NewsHour. The program was half financially focused, and half general news. It was the first regular program at CNN to have its main control room outside of Atlanta. As the show moved more towards general news and economic and political commentary, it was renamed Lou Dobbs Moneyline and then Lou Dobbs Tonight. The show was among CNN's most watched.Nielsen Media Research, June 2008. http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/2Q%20'08%20FINAL%20competitive%20P2%20Adobe%20(2).pdf%20-%20Adobe%20Acrobat%20Professional1.pdf On November 4, 2006, a taped weekend edition of Lou Dobbs Tonight, entitled Lou Dobbs this Week, began airing. The weekend show, which aired every Saturday and Sunday night, discussed a variety of heated issues from the past week and the week ahead. The weekend show has since been canceled. On November 11, 2009, Lou Dobbs left the network, telling viewers that the night's episode of Lou Dobbs Tonight was his last and that \\"some leaders in media, politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN\\". Although he had a contract with CNN until the end of 2011, CNN agreed to release him early. After his resignation, the show was temporarily replaced by CNN Tonight, a news program hosted by John Roberts and later Erica Hill which featured reports filed by reporters who had filed reports for Lou Dobbs' program. On January 15, 2010, CNN Tonight was displaced by The Situation Room in a scheduling shift as a result of the premiere of Rick's List.

Dobbs had compiled a list of companies that had outsourced that he had posted on the show's website and occasionally repeated on the air. Dobbs frequently criticized U.S. international trade policy as insufficiently protecting American jobs, advocating in favor of what many consider to be economic protectionism in contrast to free trade. As part of his criticism of globalization, Dobbs often noted that the United States is running trade deficits with virtually every major trading partner it has, especially China. Another regular feature was \\"Broken Borders\\", which highlighted what Dobbs considered to be the problems and costs associated with illegal immigrants, and the inefficiencies in the U.S. Border Patrol and immigration policies in general. Around the middle of the show, a daily poll was opened that was answered on the show's website. Voting for the poll continued until the end of the show, when the results of the poll along with some viewer comments were revealed. These polls were often overwhelming in their margins. Correspondents and production Kitty Pilgrim was a correspondent for the program, and the most frequent substitute anchor when Dobbs was not on. Other reporters attached to Lou Dobbs Tonight included Dana Bash, Lisa Sylvester, Bill Tucker, Suzanne Malveaux and Casey Wian. The show was broadcast live from CNN's New York studios, located in the Time Warner Center. Criticism Critics of his broadcast, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, allege Lou Dobbs Tonight regularly aired segments featuring people that the SPLC considers to be involved with white supremacist groups, particularly as on-air guests, without the show revealing involvement in such groups. Ratings Its highest rated show in 2008 was the day after the presidential election - two million viewers. Lou Dobbs Tonight was off by 15 percent between January 26 and February 22, 2009, according to Nielsen Media Research data.

Span of control refers to the number of subordinates a supervisor has. Simply a manager or a supervisor or a superior who has a group of subordinates, who can directly report him or her is called a Span of Management. Overview In simple words, span of control means the manageable number of subordinates of a superior.The bigger the number of the subordinates a manager controls, the broader is her/his span of control. In the hierarchical business organization of some time in the past it was not uncommon to see average spans of 1-to-4 or even less. That is, one manager supervised four employees on average. In the 1980s corporate leaders flattened many organizational structures causing average spans to move closer to 1-to-10. That was made possible primarily by the development of inexpensive information technology. As information technology was developed capable of easing many middle manager tasks ‚Äì tasks like collecting, manipulating and presenting operational information ‚Äì upper managers found they could hire fewer middle managers to do more work managing more subordinates for less money. The current shift to self-directed cross-functional teams and other forms of non-hierarchical structures, have made the concept of span of control less important. Theories about the optimum span of control go back to V. A. Graicunas. In 1933 he used assumptions about mental capacity and attention span to develop a set of practical heuristics. Lyndall Urwick (1956) developed a theory based on geographical dispersion and the need for face to face meetings. In spite of numerous attempts since then, no convincing theories have been presented. This is because the optimum span of control depends on numerous variables including organizational structure, available technology, the functions being performed, and the competencies of the manager as well as staff. An alternative view is proposed by Elliott Jaques that a manager may have up to as many immediate subordinates that they can know personally in the sense that they can assess personal effectiveness. Factors affecting span of control These are the factors affecting span of control: # Geographical dispersion, if the branches of a business are widely dispersed, then the manager will find it difficult to supervise each of them, as such the span of control will be smaller. # Capability of employees: if employees are highly capable, need little supervision, and can be left on their own, e.g., Theory Y type of people, they need not be supervised closely as they are motivated and take initiative to work; as such, the span of control may be broader. # Capability of managers, an experienced manager with good understanding of the tasks, good knowledge of the workers and good relationships with the workers, will be able to supervise more workers # Value-add of the manager: a manager that is adding value by training and developing new skills in the workers will need a more narrow span of control than one who is focused only on performance management (this is the reverse of the capability of workers point above) # Similarity of task: if the tasks that the subordinates are performing are similar, then the span of control can be wider, as the manager can supervise them all at the same time. # Volume of other tasks: if the manager has other responsibilities, such as membership of committees, involvement in other projects, liaising with stakeholders, the number of direct reports will need to be smaller # Required administrative tasks: if the manager is required to have regular face-to-face meetings, complete appraisal and development plans, discuss remuneration benefits, write job descriptions and employment contracts, explain employment policy changes, and other administrative task:, span of control may be reduced. # Business process streamlining, effectiveness, and efficiency can reduce the span of control. Theoretical considerations The first to develop a more general theory of management was Henry Fayol, who had gathered empirical experience during his time as general manager of a coal and steel company, the Commentary-Fourchambault Company. He was first to add a managerial perspective to the problem of organizational governance. The rationale for defining a strict hierarchy of communication channels is found in the need for vertical integration of activities, imposed by management's need for control and information. However, exercising control over activities performed by subordinates and monitoring their communication, the nodes at the upper hierarchical levels would be suffering from information overload, since all communication to other branches of the organizational structure would be routed through them. In addition, a larger number of subordinates also requires supervisors to monitor a high number of interactions below their own level, i.e. that information overload and span of control are positively correlated. Graicunas (Gulick and Urwick, 1937) distinguished three types of interactions ‚Äì direct single relationships, cross-relationships, and direct group relationships ‚Äì each of them contributing to the total amount of interactions within the organization. According to Graicunas, the number of possible interactions can be computed in the following way. Let n be the number of subordinates reporting to a supervisor. Then, the number of relationships of direct single type the supervisor could possibly engage into is : n. The number of interactions between subordinates (cross relationships) he has to monitor is : n (n - 1) and the number of direct group relationships is : n (2^n / 2 - 1) The sum of these three types of interactions is the number of potential relationships of a supervisor. Graicunas showed with these formulas, that each additional subordinate increases the number of potential interactions significantly. It appears natural, that no organization can afford to maintain a control structure of a dimension being required for implementing a scalar chain under the unity of command condition. Therefore, other mechanisms had to be found for dealing with the dilemma of maintaining managerial control, while keeping cost and time at a reasonable level, thus making the span of control a critical figure for the organization. Consequently, for a long time, finding the optimum span of control has been a major challenge to organization design. As Mackenzie (1978, p 121) describes it: > ‚ÄùOne could argue that with larger spans, the costs of supervision would tend > to be reduced, because a smaller percentage of the members of the > organization are supervisors. On the other hand, if the span of control is > too large, the supervisor may not have the capacity to supervise effectively > such large numbers of immediate subordinates. Thus, there is a possible > trade-off to be made in an attempt to balance these possibly opposing > tendencies.‚Äù Fayol proposed that subordinate employees should be allowed to communicate directly with each other, given that their superiors had agreed upon this procedure. This principle became known under the name of Fayol's bridge. The use of Fayol‚Äôs bridge resulted in a number of other aspects needing to be taken into consideration. In order to put this system to work, Taylor‚Äôs functional foremanship has to be abandoned, and unity of command needs to be established. At the same time, decision power is distributed to individuals on lower levels in the organization, and only decisions that exceed the pre- defined decision scope of an employee are referred upwards. This, in turn, strengthens the co-equality of authority and responsibility. Since a Fayol bridge is not limited to a certain functional area within the organization, but can span over functional boundaries, e.g. from purchasing to manufacturing, it can be considered as a first attempt to create a horizontal integration of related activities under a certain level of self-management, an early business process. Mackenzie and others (Massie 1965, Pugh et al., 1972) also noted that there is no generally applicable optimum span of control. There are instead several factors influencing the balance between the desired level of control, and the manageability of the organization. Firstly, it depends on the capabilities of the organizational members, managers and workers. It was assumed, that no manager would be capable of supervising more than 5-6 direct subordinates. However, this conclusion built on the assumption, that the superior must actively monitor the work of all subordinates. Later on, this statement was diversified, and Davis (1951) divided managerial work into two categories, one requiring the attention to physical work, the other one requiring mental activity. Depending on the type of supervision, a span of 3-8 subordinates for managers at higher levels was considered adequate, while first level supervisors, i.e. those supervising shop floor personnel could have up to 30 subordinates. The neoclassical theorists have developed a different solution. They assumed that a considerable amount of decisions could be delegated to organizational members at lower organizational levels. This solution would be equivalent to the application of Fayol's bridge combined with the principle of employee initiative that he proposed. As a result, the need for supervision would be reduced from direct control to exception handling. According to this assumption, they considered the opportunity of having access to a supervising manager would be sufficient to satisfy the need for control in standard situations. Peter Drucker refers to this principle as the span of managerial responsibility.

She has also represented Great Britain at the World Archery Championships and the Archery World Cup, and England at the Commonwealth Games. Following a string of national titles in the early 2000s, Folkard won selection for the British Olympic archery team in 2004. She has since regularly competed in international recurve archery events, including the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Summer Olympics. She is also a prominent competitor in field archery, having won medals at the World Games and the World Field Archery Championships. Early and personal life Naomi Folkard was born on 18 September 1983 in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. She was introduced to archery at the age of five, first trying out the sport at a family scout camp. At twelve years old she was a member of the British junior team and progressed to the British senior team at the age of sixteen. Folkard's parents have both competed in archery competitions at the county level, and as of 2012 her brother was a member of the British junior team. Folkard studied music at the University of Birmingham, competing in the 2004 Summer Olympics shortly after finishing her second year examinations. She began playing the violin and the piano at a young age, and credits her early experiences with the violin for her adeptness at archery, saying \\"it was obvious I had a greater co-ordination than most children of my age because of my music\\". In 2009 Folkard said had she not become an archer she would probably be a member of an orchestra. Career =Early career= Folkard was British champion in 2000, 2001, and 2003, and competed in the World Student Games in 2003. She was a reserve for Britain's archery team for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In 2004, she won the UK Indoor Archery Championships in the women's individual recurve category, shortly before qualifying for the Olympics in Athens later that year. Folkard emerged from the 2006 European Indoor Archery Championships a medallist, finishing second and coming away with a silver medal. =Olympic Games= ;2004 Summer Olympics Folkard won selection for the 2004 Summer Olympics in April 2004, joining Helen Palmer and four-time Olympian Alison Williamson as a member of Great Britain's women's team. Folkard concluded the 72-arrow ranking round, which determined the seedings for the subsequent elimination rounds, in seventeenth position for the women's individual event and commented that although she had difficulty with her opening and closing arrows, \\"the middle bit was pretty good\\". She progressed as far as the third round where she was defeated by the top seed Park Sung-hyun of South Korea, losing to the eventual gold medalist by twelve points over the match's eighteen arrows. Folkard, Palmer, and Williamson fared poorly in the women's team event where they were defeated by India in the opening elimination round. ;2008 Summer Olympics At the 2008 Summer Olympics Folkard combined with teammates Williamson and Charlotte Burgess to take an unexpected second place for Great Britain in the ranking round for the women's team event, trailing only defending champions South Korea. The three progressed through the elimination rounds to reach the semi- finals, where a defeat to China sent them to contest the bronze medal match against France. After a thunderstorm postponed the match for 50 minutes, Folkard and her teammates shot below expectations and lost the twenty-four- arrow contest by two points. In a profile published in 2012, The Telegraph listed failing to win a medal in Beijing as her biggest sporting disappointment. For the women's individual event Folkard had concluded the ranking round in eighth place with a score of 651 points from a maximum of 720. She advanced to the last sixteen of the competition but was defeated in the third round by Japan's Nami Hayakawa after a series of poor-scoring shots. ;2012 Summer Olympics Folkard secured her place as one of three British female archers for the 2012 Olympic games in April 2012 at the national trials held in Lilleshall. She and teammates Williamson and Amy Oliver exited early from the women's team event after defeat to Russia in the opening round, having finished eleventh out of twelve nations in the ranking round. Folkard entered the elimination rounds of the women's individual event as the highest-placed Briton in forty-second place. Following a first-round victory over Russia's Kristina Timofeeva, which was praised by The Telegraph as a \\"fitting riposte\\" following the earlier British loss in the team event, Folkard bowed out to Mexico's Mariana Avitia in the second round. ;2016 Summer Olympics Folkard qualified for her fourth Olympic Games in June 2016, entering as one of two British archers contesting the 2016 Summer Olympics. She achieved a career- best Olympic performance by reaching the quarter-finals of the women's individual competition, matching the pre-Games target set for Great Britain's archers, where she lost to the eventual gold medalist Chang Hye-jin of South Korea. Following her defeat Folkard announced that Rio 2016 was to be her last Olympic games, saying \\"I've been a full-time archer for 11 years now and I need a life\\" and adding that she planned to become a coach. =Other competitions= World Archery Championships At the 2007 World Archery Championships Folkard won bronze medal with Alison Williamson and Charlotte Burgess in the women's team recurve event, defeating Italy in the third-place match after a loss to South Korea in the semi-finals. Folkard fared less well two years later at the 2009 Championships, advancing no further than the second round in both her team and individual competitions. She would however win two further bronze medals in the late 2010s, finishing third in the mixed team recurve with Patrick Huston at the 2017 Championships in Mexico City and later in the women's team recurve at the 2019 Championships in 's-Hertogenbosch. Folkard won two medals each at the 2012 and 2014 World Field Archery Championships. At the 2012 Championships in Val-d'Is√®re in France she achieved a gold and a bronze in the women's team and individual competitions respectively before following up with two bronze medals in the same events in 2014. Archery World Cup Folkard achieved three medals at the Archery World Cup between 2007 and 2010. At the fourth stage of the 2007 World Cup in Dover she won gold in the women's recurve tournament with Alison Williamson and Charlotte Burgess, and in the 2008 edition combined with Williamson and Burgess to take gold in the Santo Domingo in April and bronze in Bo√© in June. With Edinburgh selected as the host for the final stage of the 2010 World Cup, Folkard was entered as a wildcard alongside other British athletes and won silver medal in the mixed team recurve competition with Simon Terry. Folkard later took a bronze medal at the 2017 Indoor World Cup in N√Æmes. World Games, Commonwealth Games, and European Games Folkard has contested the World Games three times, winning a medal in each of her appearances in the women's individual recurve event of the field archery competition. At the Games in 2009 in Taiwan Folkard achieved a bronze medal, and followed up four years later in Cali with gold medal, the first major title win of her career, after defeating Germany's Elena Richter in the final. Folkard reached the final again at the 2017 World Games in Wroc≈Çaw, earning the silver medal after losing to Germany's Lisa Unruh. Folkard won silver medal in the women's team recurve at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, together losing with Alison Williamson and Amy Oliver in the final by a single point to the hosts India. At the 2019 European Games Folkard won two medals, achieving gold in the women's team event with Bryony Pitman and Sarah Bettles and silver in the mixed team competition with Patrick Huston.

During his lifetime, he was usually referred to as \\"Jimmy K.\\" due to NA's principle of personal anonymity on the public level. He never referred to himself as the founder of NA, although the record clearly shows that he played a founding role. Mr. Crookshank When Kinnon was seven years old he befriended a local alcoholic whom he referred to as Mr. Crookshank. Kinnon would often find him drunk and beaten. One day he found Crookshank badly beaten up and unresponsive. Kinnon ran for help. Over the following weeks Kinnon did not see Crookshank and, after numerous inquiries, his mother took him to see his friend. They went to an institution of which Crookshank was now a resident. He was wheelchair-bound and incoherent. Upon leaving the facility, Kinnon told his mother that when he grew up he was going to help people like Mr. Crookshank. archive.org Early life Kinnon was born in Paisley, Scotland on 5 April 1911, the first of five children born to parents of Irish descent. Jimmy's father moved to America in 1921 and the rest of the family in 1923. His sister was hospitalised and their mother stayed by her side while he was left with his three brothers on Ellis Island for three and a half days. Living in Philadelphia, he attended a Catholic seminary in nearby Germantown and had plans, or his parents had plans for him, of entering the priesthood, which meant six rigorous years of training. While still at the seminary, he began using alcohol and pills which started his years of addiction until he got clean in 1950. He eventually became a roofer and painter. He met his future wife Agnes in Philadelphia. They had six children together in California where they moved in the early 1940s. Getting clean Kinnon stopped using all mood and mind-altering substances on 2 February 1950. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous, a twelve-step program. While in Alcoholics Anonymous he met other members who had struggled with addiction to substances other than alcohol. Alcoholics Anonymous often discouraged members from talking about addictions other than alcohol. Jimmy saw the need to recover from more than the symptom, i.e. substance used (alcohol, pills, etc.) by addressing the addict's thinking and attitudes before, during and in between using. This is why, for NA, he would change the language of Step 1 of the 12 Steps of AA from \\"We admitted we were powerless over ALCOHOL, that our lives had become unmanageable\\" to \\"We admitted we were powerless over OUR ADDICTION, that our lives had become unmanageable \\". Kinnon attended meetings of another group called Habit-forming Drugs but was disappointed with it. na12.org Formation of Narcotics Anonymous In the summer of 1953 Jimmy Kinnon and other members of Alcoholics Anonymous began holding their own separate meetings, which they called Narcotics Anonymous. Kinnon and several others were given permission from Alcoholics Anonymous to adapt the AA Twelve Steps, but Jimmy changed Step 1 from \\"We admitted we were powerless over alcohol...\\" to \\"We admitted we were powerless over our addiction...\\" This was a significant change of focus from the AA program, because NA is focused on recovery from the disease of addiction rather than any particular substance. Kinnon saw the substance as a symptom of a deeper core issue, (i.e. the obsessive thinking and compulsive behavior) from which the substance is used to gain a temporary relief. Narcotics Anonymous was officially founded in July 1953 in Sun Valley, California. There was a different organization also called Narcotics Anonymous that was previously founded in the forties by a recovering addict named Danny Carlsen in New York City, but it did not follow the 12 Traditions and was more of a social-services organization than a Fellowship. It died out in the mid-1960s and was never connected to the NA Kinnon started in Sun Valley. Literature Most of Narcotics Anonymous early literature was written by Jimmy Kinnon and is still used worldwide today in over 70,000 NA meetings. He was the main contributor to the Yellow Booklet and Little White Booklet that were used throughout the 1960s and 1970s. From 1953 to 1977 Narcotics Anonymous had only a set of pamphlets and booklets as literature. From 1979-1982 hundreds of Narcotics Anonymous members from the \\"new\\" generation of drug users of the sixties and seventies expanded on this literature and created The Basic Text. Kinnon also designed the NA logo, The Group Logo, The Service Symbol and wrote the Gratitude Prayer and \\"Fruit of the Harvest\\" statement found in the beginning of The Basic Text. This book was the first ever known that was written by recovering addicts for recovering addicts. It was first published in 1982.Narcotics Anonymous wikipedia.org 9.3 million copies of The Basic Text have been published since 1982, in 31 languages. Death James Kinnon, who had fought a battle against tuberculosis from the late sixties on, died of lung cancer on 9 July 1985, in California. Prior to his death he said, if he ever had a headstone it would read, \\"All we did was sow some seeds and work and wrought to make this work, so that we and others could live. In Peace, in Freedom and in Love\\".Cathie Kinnon Linder and Rob Roehm. Every Addicts Friend Jimmy K. Reflections of a Daughter. Linder and Roehm, 2010.

At , it is Canada's tallest skyscraper and the 15th tallest building in North America to structural top (spires) and 9th highest to the roof top, and the 105th tallest in the world. It is the third tallest free-standing structure in Canada, after the CN Tower (also in Toronto) and the Inco Superstack chimney in Sudbury, Ontario. The building is owned by Brookfield Office Properties, putting it in co-ownership with the neighbouring Exchange Tower and Bay Adelaide Centre as well as various other office spaces across Downtown Toronto. History and architecture First Canadian Place under construction in 1975 First Canadian Place is named for Canada's first bank, the Bank of Montreal. Designed by B+H Architects with Edward Durell Stone as design consultant, First Canadian Place was constructed in 1975 and originally named First Bank Building. The tower and associated buildings occupy a block once home to two major newspapers, the Toronto Star‚Äôs Toronto Star Building and The Globe and Mails William H. Wright Building. The site was the last of corners of King and Bay to be redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, and a major bidding war began over the property. The then little known firm of Olympia and York eventually obtained nearly the whole city block, though the election of reformist mayor David Crombie led to new rules banning skyscrapers and it took three years of lobbying before permission for First Canadian Place was granted. When completed, the building was nearly identical in appearance to Stone's Aon Center in Chicago, Illinois; completed two years previous as the Standard Oil Building, the Chicago tower is of the same floor plan and clad in the same marble, the only overtly visible difference being the vertical orientation of the windows, as opposed to the horizontal run of those on First Canadian Place. First Canadian Place was the 6th tallest building in the world to structural top (currently 103rd) and the tallest building overall outside of Chicago and New York when built in 1975. It was also the tallest building in the Commonwealth of Nations until the completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1998. The Bank of Montreal \\"M-bar\\" logo at the top of the building was the highest sign in the world from 1975 until overtaken by the sign atop CITIC Plaza in 1997. The roof is still the location of a number of antennas used for radio and television broadcasting. The structure contains 29 elevators, and is one of only a few buildings in the world that uses the double-decked variety, and is connected to the underground PATH system. The building was pictured on the front and rear cover of the 1981 album This Is the Ice Age by Canadian New Wave band Martha and the Muffins and also their 7\\" single \\"Women Around the World at Work\\". The album featured two photos which were taken from the same place but at different times by Muffins guitarist Mark Gane using a time lapse camera and features the building at midday and dusk. The 7\\" cover again features the same photo but has 9 small images taken at various times of the day and night. =Cladding= The same white Carrara marble used on Aon Center was employed as an exterior cladding and interior finish for First Canadian Place, with approximately 45,000 marble panels weighing around each. Foreshadowing what would take place with First Canadian Place in 2007, one of the marble slabs of Aon Center, when it was named the Standard Oil Building, detached in 1974, falling and penetrating the roof of a neighbouring building, resulting in an eventual recladding of the entire Aon Center in white granite between 1992 and 1994. This problem would surface at First Canadian Place as well, during an intense storm on the evening of 15 May 2007, a , white marble panel fell from the 60th storey of the tower's southern face onto the 3rd floor mezzanine roof below, causing authorities to close surrounding streets as a precaution. In late 2009, owner Brookfield Properties announced it would follow the example of Aon Center and, over three years, replace the tower's 45,000 marble panels with new ones in glass, those on the main expanses with a white ceramic frit and the corners in a bronze tint. Brookfield and the co-owners also launched a multi-faceted rejuvenation program, including \\"upgrades to the building's mechanical, electrical, and lighting systems that will redefine the standard for enhanced performance, comfort, and greening\\". FCP's common areas including upper and lower level entrance and elevator lobbies, the retail concourse and Market Place were to also undergo renovation, with new natural stone flooring, fritted glass accents, brushed metal handrails, landscaping, and water features. The rejuvenation program design architects were Moed de Armas & Shannon Architects and Bregman + Hamann Architects were the architects of record. The entire project, completed in 2012, cost was in excess of CA$100 million, paid by the owner. This extensive capital improvement project was intended to provide a new exterior for FCP and eliminate the maintenance costs associated with marble upkeep.

Kedyw was created on January 22, 1943, from two pre- existing Armia Krajowa organizations: ZwiƒÖzek Odwetu (Association of Retaliation), and Wachlarz. Initially the units were small and town-based. Eventually, as more were formed, some moved into forested areas to begin partisan warfare. Kedyw organized weapon and munition factories, military schools, intelligence, counter-intelligence, field hospitals, and a communication network. Kolegium A on Stawki Street in the Wola district - Warsaw Uprising 1944 Most members of Kedyw were Boy Scouts from ZwiƒÖzek Harcerstwa Polskiego and its wartime organization, Szare Szeregi. Many of the officers were cichociemni, special agents trained in the United Kingdom and parachuted into occupied Poland. Selected Kedyw groups (patrole) carried out operations all over occupied Poland. Notable types of operations included: * the sabotaging of rail lines, bridges and roads ** the burning of trains and fuel depots * the destruction or damaging of weapon factories working for the Wehrmacht * the liberation of hundreds of prisoners and hostages ** a famous operation of this type, which took place on March 26, 1943, is known as \\"Akcja pod Arsena≈Çem\\" * executions of Nazi collaborators and traitors sentenced by an underground court ** one of these involved Igo Sym, a Polish actor who had been informing the Germans about Home Army operations * executions of particularly brutal individuals among the German occupation troops, Gestapo, SS and police known as Operation HeadsTomasz Strzembosz, Akcje zbrojne podziemnej Warszawy 1939-1944, Warszawa, 1978 ** those executed included SS and police General Franz Kutschera, killed on February 2, 1944, SS- Hauptscharfuhrer August Kretschmann, commandant of the Gƒôsi√≥wka concentration camp, SS-Rottenf√ºhrer Ewald Lange , SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Herbert Schultz, SS- Oberscharf√ºhrer Franz B√ºrkl and many others (more than 2,000 people).

Notable among them were \\"Zo≈õka\\", \\"Parasol\\" and \\"Miot≈Ça\\". After fighting broke out, most of the Kedyw forces joined the Rados≈Çaw group. Kedyw units were among the most successful in the Uprising. The boy scouts not only had more experience than many regular soldiers, they had also managed to collect more supplies and arms. Kedyw units first took part in seizing control of Warsaw's Wola district. After 10 days' heavy fighting in the PowƒÖzki Cemetery, in which all German attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties, the units withdrew overnight to the city center and Star√≥wka (the old town), where they regrouped and defended their sectors until the capitulation of the Uprising in October 1944.

He is renowned as a prominent liberal reformer of Islam, who devoted himself to educational reform and the revival of independent reasoning (ijtihad). His works are subject of widespread interest in countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey. After teaching in Britain and Canada, he was appointed head of the Central Institute of Islamic Research of Pakistan in 1963. Although his works were widely respected by other Islamic reformers, they were also heavily criticized by conservative scholars as being overtly liberal.Sonn, Tamara. (1995). \\"Rahman, Fazlur\\". In John L. Esposito. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World. Oxford: Oxford University Press. This was quickly exploited by opponents of his political patron, General Ayub Khan, and led to his eventual exile in the United States. He left Pakistan in 1968 for the United States where he taught at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Chicago. Biography Rahman was born in the Hazara District of the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) of British India (now Pakistan). His father, Maulana Shihab al-Din, was a well-known scholar of the time who had studied at Deoband and had achieved the rank of alim, through his studies of Islamic law, prophetic narrations, Quran'ic commentaries, logic, philosophy and other subjects. Although Fazlur Rahman may not have himself attended a Darul uloom (traditional seat of Islamic knowledge), his father acquainted him with the traditional Islamic sciences, and he eventually memorized the entire Qur'an at the age of ten.Emi Irfa, \\"The concept of battle against non Muslim in the Holy Qur‚Äôan (application of Fazlur Rahman‚Äôs double movement method)\\" (thesis), 2015, p. 22 Rahman studied Arabic at Punjab University, and went on to Oxford University, where he wrote a dissertation on Ibn Sina. Afterwards, he began a teaching career, first at Durham University, where he taught Persian and Islamic philosophy, and then at McGill University, where he taught Islamic studies until 1961. In that year, he returned to Pakistan at the behest of President Ayub Khan to head up the Central Institute of Islamic Research in Karachi which was set up by the Pakistani government in order to implement Islam into the daily dealings of the nation. However, due to the political situation in Pakistan, Rahman was hindered from making any progress in this endeavour. Orthodox ulema opposed his modernist interpretations and after Ayub Khan's power weakened, they denounced Rahman as an apostate and called for his death as a wajib ul qatl.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.42, 48 He resigned from the post in September 1968 and left for the United States. In the US he returned to teaching, and taught at UCLA as a visiting professor for a year. He moved to the University of Chicago in 1969 and established himself there becoming the Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Islamic Thought. At Chicago he was instrumental for building a strong Near Eastern Studies program that continues to be among the best in the world. Rahman also became a proponent for a reform of the Islamic polity and was an advisor to the State Department. Rahman died in Chicago, Illinois July 26, 1988 at the University of Chicago Medical Center from complications of coronary bypass surgery. A resident of suburban Naperville, Illinois at his death, he is buried in Arlington Cemetery, Elmhurst, Illinois. Since Rahman's death his writings have continued to be popular among scholars of Islam and the Near East. His contributions to the University of Chicago are still evident in its excellent programs in these areas. In his memory, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago named its common area after him, due to his many years of service at the Center and at the University of Chicago at large. He was a polyglot who, apart from mastering Urdu, Persian, Arabic and English quite early in his life, eventually also learned classical Greek, Latin, German and French in order to be more efficient in his academic career.Muhammad Khalid Masud, In Memorium: Dr. Fazlur Rahman (1919-1988), Islamic Studies, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Winter 1988), p. 399  Views  He argued that the basis of Islamic revival was the return to the intellectual dynamism that was the hallmark of the Islamic scholarly tradition (these ideas are outlined in Revival and Reform in Islam: A Study of Islamic Fundamentalism and his magnum opus, Islam). He sought to give philosophy free rein, and was keen on Muslims appreciating how the modern nation-state understood law, as opposed to ethics; his view being that the shari'ah was a mixture of both ethics and law. He was critical of historical Muslim theologies and philosophies for failing to create a moral and ethical worldview based on the values derived from the Qur'an: 'moral values', unlike socioeconomic values, 'are not exhausted at any point in history' but require constant interpretation. He also believed that the modern conservatism of Islamic world is a defensive and temporary posture against the perceived political and economic setbacks of the Muslim world. Adding to this was stagnation in Islamic education begun in the early Middle Ages, which led to the inadequate understanding of Qur'anic teachings. =Riba= The issue of what is riba and whether it includes all interest on loans has been a major issue in Islam during the 20th century and early 21st. The Islamic revival movement that grew in strength and influence during Rahman's lifetime, considered all and any interest on loans riba and a \\"curse\\", and considered putting an end to it a top priority. As an Islamic Modernist, Rahman disagreed, believing that only high-interest loans were riba, and in particularly that riba referred only to a particular type of interest charged in the time of Muhammad. He cited the Muwatta of Imam Malik in arguing that riba should not be interpreted literally but must be understood in the context of pre-Islamic Arab moneylending customs. Feisal Khan describes his position as being that > The banned riba in the Quran referred to a particular custom, riba al-nasiah > or riba al-jahaliyah, where when the debt came due it was traditional to ask > the borrower \`will you pay or will you riba?\` If the borrower chose the > latter, he would be granted an extension on the loan but the amount due > would be doubled -- hense the riba. ... If the borrower then defaulted on > the doubled amount, his debt was redoubled and he was given another time > extension: if unable to pay, he and all his possessions could be auctioned > off to satisfy his creditors.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.54 Rahman himself wrote that > the initial interest itself was not usurious and was, therefore, not > considered riba. What made it riba was the increase ... that raised the > principal several-fold by continued redoubling. This contradicted the contention of famous Islamist author Maulana Maududi that there was no initial interest‚Äîthat money lenders made initial loans \\"granted free of interest\\"‚Äîwhich was doubtful on the grounds that professional moneylenders would ever make loans for free. Rahman concluded that the Quran banned \\"extreme usury and so by extension injustice but not interest.\\"  Publications  *Islam, University of Chicago Press, 2nd edition, 1979. * Prophecy in Islam: Philosophy and Orthodoxy, University of Chicago Press, 1979, 2011 *Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition, University of Chicago Press, 1982. *Major Themes of the Qur'an, University of Chicago Press, 2009. *Revival and Reform in Islam (ed.

It was programmed by Epyx employee Scott Nelson, who was originally a programmer for StarpathThe Dot Eaters - Epyx  The Dot Eaters, Scott Nelson, one of the former Starpath programmers, had created a decathlon game for the Supercharger called Sweat!, but when the company merges with Epyx the project is shelved. and later designed the Epyx Vorpal fastloading system for the company's games. Description The Epyx Fast Load cartridge was a bestseller for the C64. Epyx Fast Load allows programs to load from the Commodore 1541 disk drive at 2,500 bytes per second, approximately five times faster than the normal speed. Since it is stored on a cartridge, and thus provides instant access without requiring any hardware modification of the C64 or the disk drive, the Fast Load quickly became a very popular peripheral among C64 users. In addition to disk acceleration, the cartridge also provides a built-in version of the Commodore DOS Wedge. This dramatically reduces the number of keystrokes needed to load or save files or perform disk operations, and makes the cartridge even more convenient. Epyx Fast Load incorporates a machine language monitor. Although it does not include an assembler, as most \\"standard\\" C64 ML monitors do, it includes a wide array of powerful debugging tools. These include disassembly, single-stepping, and an automatic machine code relocator. A crude disk editor is also included with the cartridge, which displays raw data from floppy disks in classical hex+ASCII split screen mode. Among other things, the disk editor can be used to enter cheat codes and do the home computer equivalent of ROM hacking. In the unusual case of software that doesn't work with the Fast Load, the cartridge can be disabled via a menu command, thus avoiding the need to physically remove and reinsert it. While the original 1984 version of the Fast Load will not work with the SD2IEC floppy drive emulation system, newer variants of the cartridge do support it. Reception In a review of three Commodore 64 fast loaders, Ahoy! wrote that Fast Load \\"is surprisingly transparent to all the forms of commercial copy protection we have looked at ... In terms of greatest convenience and speed, we place our bets on\\" it. A review of five fast loaders in Commodore Microcomputers found that \\"Fast Load performed well during testing\\" and approved of its ease of use and documentation. However, the table included in the article showed that the cartridge only significantly sped up loading times for four of nine applications and games, not benefiting the others.

The universe is named after Noon: 22nd Century, chronologically the first novel from the series. According to Arkady Strugatsky, at first, the brothers did not make a conscious effort to create a fictional universe. Rather, they reused characters and settings from prior works whenever they found it convenient. It wasn't until later that they began drawing on common themes and plot threads from various novels to create newer works.  Description  The victory of communism and the advance of technological progress on the Earth of the Noon Universe resulted in an over-abundance of resources and eliminated the need for most types of manual labor. Mankind is capable of near-instantaneous interstellar travel. Earth social organization is presumably communist, and can be described as a highly technologically advanced anarchistic meritocracy. There is no state structure, no institutionalized coercion (no police etc.), yet functioning of the society is safeguarded by raising everyone as responsible individuals, with guidance of a set of High Councils accepted by everyone in each particular field of activity. One of the controversial occupations is progressor. They are agents embedded in less advanced humanoid civilizations in order to accelerate their development or resolve their problems. Progressors' methods range from rescuing local scientists and artists to overthrowing local governments. The main governing body is the World Council, composed of the brightest scientists, historians, doctors and teachers. The local matters are handled by the regional versions of the council. Planetary councils are present on each Earth colony (e.g. Rainbow), as well, although \\"colony\\" in this context refers to a planet that wasn't home to any sentient life before the arrival of Terran settlers. In the Noon Universe, Earth has never attempted to seize permanent control over any other civilization. The universe is populated by a number of sentient races. Some of them are humanoid, while others are so alien that humanity didn't realize that they were sentient for decades. Several sentient races maintain diplomatic relations with Earth's society. Many planets in Noon Universe are inhabited by races identical to humans in all but minor genetic differences. It has been speculated that they were humans who wound up on other worlds due to the Wanderers' manipulations (as Beetle in the Anthill shows, that is hardly unprecedented). The Wanderers are the most mysterious race in the Noon Universe. Technologically advanced and highly secretive, the Wanderers are suspected to manipulate sentient beings throughout Noon Universe for their own purposes. While those purposes were never clarified, it was hinted that they try to \\"progress\\" various sentient beings, including the human race.  Works  These works by the Strugatsky brothers are set in the Noon Universe (listed chronologically): * Noon: 22nd Century (–ü–æ–ª–¥–µ–Ω—å.

The former is set in the Noon Universe and features some well-known characters like Leonid Gorbovsky, the latter has no connection to other books about Noon Universe. * Prisoners of Power (The Inhabited Island) (–û–±–∏—Ç–∞–µ–º—ã–π –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤) * Space Mowgli (–ú–∞–ª—ã—à) * The Kid from Hell (–ü–∞—Ä–µ–Ω—å –∏–∑ –ø—Ä–µ–∏—Å–ø–æ–¥–Ω–µ–π) * Beetle in the Anthill (–ñ—É–∫ –≤ –º—É—Ä–∞–≤–µ–π–Ω–∏–∫–µ) * The Time Wanderers (–í–æ–ª–Ω—ã –≥–∞—Å—è—Ç –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä) There are loose connections to early stories The Land of Crimson Clouds (\\"–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –±–∞–≥—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Ç—É—á\\"), The Way to Amalthea (\\"–ü—É—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –ê–º–∞–ª—å—Ç–µ—é\\"), Space Apprentice (\\"–°—Ç–∞–∂–µ—Ä—ã\\"), The Final Circle of Paradise (through Ivan Zhilin), Ispytanie SKIBR, Chastnye predpolozheniya, mainly through Bykov's family. In the early 1990s the Strugatsky brothers began writing what they intended to be a final Noon Universe novel. It would have tied up some of the plot threads that were left unresolved in previous novels. However, following the death of Arkady Strugatsky, the surviving brother, Boris, felt that he could not bring himself to finish the novel. The book should have been named White Ferz (). \\"Ferz\\" or \\"Vizier\\" is the Russian term for a Queen in chess. The Strugatsky brothers planned the book as a direct sequel of Prisoners of Power following the story of infiltration of the progressor Maxim Kammerer into the elite of the Island Empire.–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –°—Ç—Ä—É–≥–∞—Ü–∫–∏–π. –ö–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∏ –∫ –ø—Ä–æ–π–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É (–∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≤–∞—Ä–∏–∞–Ω—Ç) (archived link) In the late 1990s, a collection of fiction by notable Russian scifi writers, titled The Time of the Apprentices, was published in Russia (with an endorsement of Boris Strugatsky). The pieces in the collection build upon Strugatskys' ideas and works, and many of them are set in the Noon Universe. The same period saw the re-release of all Noon Universe novels as part of the Worlds of Strugatsky Brothers series. This re-release is notable for introductory articles written by literary critics from the perspective of Noon Universe historians looking back on the events of the said novels several decades later.  Personalities  * Lev Abalkin (–ê–±–∞–ª–∫–∏–Ω, –õ–µ–≤) * Leonid Gorbovsky (–ì–æ—Ä–±–æ–≤c–∫–∏–π, –õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥) * Maxim Kammerer (–ö–∞–º–º–µ—Ä–µ—Ä, –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º) * Gennady Komov (–ö–æ–º–æ–≤, –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞–¥–∏–π) * Rudolf Sikorski (–°–∏–∫–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –†—É–¥–æ–ª—å—Ñ) * Maya Glumova (–ì–ª—É–º–æ–≤–∞, –ú–∞–π—è)  Planets  * Ark (–ö–æ–≤—á–µ–≥): described in Space Mowgli; a barren world very similar to Earth in all aspects except the biosphere. The latter is unbelievably poor: for example, the oceans of the planet are empty (no fish, no algae, no mammals) although quite suitable for protein life. This planet was chosen by progressors as a refuge and a new home for the population of Pant, a planet in danger of a global natural catastrophe. The name was given after the biblical Ark built by Noah. It was initially planned to gradually change the biosphere of Ark to make it more similar to the pantian one and then transfer all Pantians to their new home. Considering the low technological advancement level of Pantians, they should not have noticed anything at all. But this plan was canceled when the non-humanoid native civilization of Ark (Megaforms) was discovered. It isn't stated anywhere in Strugatsky's books whether the \\"Ark Project\\" (started in 2160 AD) was ever completed and how. The local civilization of Ark is nearly as enigmatic as Wanderers. An official contact with them was never established although the Ark Megaforms employed a human agent to communicate with progressors working on the surface of Ark. This agent was Piere \\"The Kid\\" Semyonov, a 13-year-old human whose parents died in 2147 when their spaceship \\"Pilgrim\\" was shot down by Wanderers' satellite from a circular orbit of Ark. Although Megaforms negotiated (through their agent) to drive progressors away from their homeworld, no further attempt to share technologies or cultural developments was registered. * Arkanar (–ê—Ä–∫–∞–Ω–∞—Ä)Although the planet was never officially named, this is the name commonly used by Russian fans. * Blue sands planet: the planet visited by the spaceship Taimyr, which returned in 2117. * Earth (–ó–µ–º–ª—è) * Garrota (–ì–∞—Ä—Ä–æ—Ç–∞): the home planet of Garrotian snails (—Å–ª–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –ì–∞—Ä—Ä–æ—Ç—ã), a non-humanoid alien race that took humans and their technology for a product of their own imagination. This planet is briefly mentioned in Space Mowgli and no further information about either the race or the planet is available. * Giganda (–ì–∏–≥–∞–Ω–¥–∞): a planet populated by humans whose technological advancement is roughly equal to that of Saraksh inhabitants. For a long time the two superpowers of the planet, Alai Duchy and the Empire, were drawn into a total war conflict that has been put an end to only when Earth's progressors started an undercover anti-war activity in 2177 AD. Apparently, no country possessed nuclear weapons. One of the planet's natives, a foot soldier of the Alai Duchy was taken to Earth and introduced to its advanced society. Despite repeated efforts to integrate him, he failed to adjust. He was then returned to Giganda. Discovered in 2136 AD. * Gorgona: the planet where the Stepchild Thomas Nielsen died in 2165, possibly a suicide. * Hope (–ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞): described briefly in Beetle in the Anthill, it is another planet populated by humans whose technological advancement is roughly equal to that of Earth in the 20th century. Approximately in 2123 AD, a massive ecological catastrophe (probably, a man-made one) devastated the planet causing its inhabitants to age at an unnatural pace after the twelfth year of life. Wanderers, apparently believing that a new, clean environment is the cure, have transported most of the population of Hope to an unknown planet using some sort of enhanced null-T, but few people decided to remain and became a subject of a consequent hunt by Wanderers (through a sophisticated system of traps, especially for children). Discovered in 2162 AD. * Leonida (–õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥–∞): the home planet of Leoniders, a humanoid alien race that lives in a perfect symbiosis with the planet's biosphere. Leonida is located in EN-23 system, its only moon is called Palmyra (–ü–∞–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–∞) and its day-night cycle lasts a bit longer than 27 hours. This planet was apparently the first one with an Earth-like climate suitable for humans' existence. Perhaps, the planet was named after its discoverer, Leonid Gorbovsky. Discovered in 2133 AD. * Mars: this solar planet featured in the Noon Universe. Mars bears complex forms of indigenous plant and animal life, though none sentient. It also bears many artifacts of an ancient supercivilization, assumed to be remnants of the Wanderers. An abandoned city sits at the North pole, and the moons Phobos and Deimos are discovered to be artificial satellites constructed by the Wanderers. * Pandora (–ü–∞–Ω–¥–æ—Ä–∞): a planet wide holiday resort. It is mostly covered with jungle swarming with dangerous alien fauna (like crayfish-spiders or tahorgs) young people just love to hunt. Every year dozens of people are killed or seriously injured on Pandora despite countless safety measures by Earth's government. No local sentient species registered. Pandora is apparently located in a system with two suns. Pandora's skies were a training ground for Headies, when humans shared the space-traveling technologies with them during the \\"Headies in Space\\" project. Discovered before 2119 AD (exact date unknown)'' * Pant (–ü–∞–Ω—Ç–∞): a planet endangered by a global catastrophe ‚Äì an explosion of its own sun as a part of standard stellar evolution. Unfortunately, there were sentient species identical to humans on the planet and so they had to be deported from it (\\"Ark Project\\") to another one. The first choice was Ark but since the discovery of a sentient alien race there, progressors have apparently changed their mind. Discovered approx. in 2161 AD. * Rainbow (–†–∞–¥—É–≥–∞) * Ruzhena (–†—É–∂–µ–Ω–∞): an Earth-like planet in VK-71016 system. Valentin Petrov, the leader of the expedition that discovered it, named the planet after his wife, Ruzhena Naskova, but the planet wasn't really hospitable: two members of the spaceship crew perished on it and Petrov himself lost an arm. Ruzhena is described in \\"–ß–∞—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è\\", a book that's been never translated in English and contains only a vague connection to the Noon Universe * Saraksh (–°–∞—Ä–∞–∫—à) * Saula (–°–∞—É–ª–∞) * Tagora (–¢–∞–≥–æ—Ä–∞): the home planet of Tagorians, a lizard-like alien race, the first one Earth's ever contacted with. It is mentioned in An Attempt to Escape that there is a human resident (or spy) on Tagora whose name is presumably Benny Durov (–ë–µ–Ω–Ω–∏ –î—É—Ä–æ–≤) and he is a progressor working under cover to study Tagorian technology. Discovered in the end of 21st century although a full scaled contact was established in 2122 AD. * Tissa (–¢–∏—Å—Å–∞): a planet in EN-63061 system. It is famous mostly for an incident that happened shortly after a FSG expedition discovered it. For some reason the members of the group couldn't establish a radio connection to any human world or spaceship except for their own mothership on the orbit of Tissa, and its computers kept telling them that Earth and all other human settlements were destroyed by global catastrophes and that they are the only remaining humans in the Universe. After the group was rescued, psychologists decided that this was a case of temporary madness or a mass suggestion. Tissa is only mentioned in The Time Wanderers. Discovered in 2193 AD. * Vladislava (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤–∞): the first planet (apart from Mars) where Wanderers' traces were found (artificial satellites and an abandoned city). Apart from that, the planet is known for its extremely turbulent atmosphere conquered only by famous Leonid Gorbovsky. Despite that, there is some protein life on the planet although no sentient one. Vladislava is located in EN-17 solar system. Discovered in 2121 AD. * Yaila (–Ø–π–ª–∞): an even harsher and more dangerous version of Pandora. Infamous for its monstrous fauna (e.g. Yaila Dragon, presumably, a reptile with an enormous regeneration potential) and its impenetrable jungle and swamps it is considered by many to be just another planet-wide resort, but generally only the toughest and most experienced hunters dare to visit Yaila.  Races  The following sentient species are depicted: * Ark Megaforms (–Ω–µ–≥—É–º–∞–Ω–æ–∏–¥—ã –ö–æ–≤—á–µ–≥–∞) * Garrotian Snails (—Å–ª–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –ì–∞—Ä—Ä–æ—Ç—ã) * Golovans (–ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã) * Humans (–ª—é–¥–∏) ** Ludens (–ª—é–¥–µ–Ω—ã) * Leoniders (–ª–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥—è–Ω–µ) * Tagorians (—Ç–∞–≥–æ—Ä—è–Ω–µ) * Wanderers (–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏) Other possibly sentient species mentioned in the books are septoids (see Noon: 22nd Century) whose sentience is not really confirmed, semi-sentient prehistoric molluscs katapumoridako (see The Time Wanderers) and the unidentified sentient creature killed by Pol Gnedykh in the Kroox solar system (Noon: 22nd Century).  Reception, analysis and influence  The setting is a future utopia that gets gradually deconstructed as the authors become disillusioned with the Soviet Union, moving away from the \\"technological optimism... depicting a quasi- Marxist perfection\\" to address the failures of the Soviet society. In writing about the Noon Universe, Strugatsky brothers have been argued to have created their own utopian ideology, or \\"amateur personal metaphysics\\", based on the primacy of science, not unlike more modern view of transhumanism. It has been suggested that James Cameron's Avatar's lush jungle planet has been inspired by Noon Universe's planet Pandora. The Noon Universe human civilization has been described as techno-patriarchal, and some of the antagonists as eco- matriarchal.

He graduated with an A.B. in politics from Princeton University in 1955 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"The Financially Irresponsible Motorist -a Problem in Practical Politics.\\" Career After college, Lewis joined Progressive Insurance as an underwriting trainee. In 1965, he and his mother borrowed $2.5 million, pledging their majority stake as collateral, and completed a leveraged buyout of Progressive. Lewis became chief executive officer of a company which had 40 employees at that time. He subsequently grew the business and, by the 1960s, Progressive had over 100 employees and $6 million in annual revenue. Lewis focused on insuring high- risk drivers ‚Äî where premiums were greater ‚Äî using an innovative pricing system and consumer-friendly service offering competitor quote matching and instant claims service. He also brought in a slew of young, enthusiastic workers and devolved decision-making downward, fostering a relaxed yet disciplined and creative corporate culture. As of 2010, Progressive had grown to 27,250 employees, with sales of $15.0 billion and had become the third- largest auto insurance company in the United States. In 2000, Lewis retired as CEO of Progressive, though he remained as Chairman of the Board. Philanthropy and political contributions Lewis frequently donated money to charities and liberal political groups. He was a patron of the arts, even going so far as to display Andy Warhol's 10-part series of China's Chairman Mao Zedong in 1974 at Progressive's office in Mayfield Village. Lewis's personal and corporate contemporary art collection is well known ‚Äî the corporate collection is displayed at Progressive Insurance offices.

Lewis was a trustee of Princeton University, former chairman of the board of directors at the Guggenheim Museum (resigned January 19, 2005), and served on the board of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Although Lewis often gave substantial gifts to artistic and educational organizations, he also had a reputation for ‚Äî often forcefully ‚Äî insisting that such organizations be financially accountable and financially sound; in 2002, Lewis said he would no longer give to Case or Cleveland's University Circle neighborhood or to any Cleveland Charities due to poor civic and organizational leadership and management. While he did restrict Cleveland giving, he did not follow through completely on that threat. Lewis was an advocate of taxing and regulating the use and sale of marijuana and was one of the main financial backers of the campaign to legalize the use of marijuana for medical use in the United States. In January 2000, Lewis was arrested and charged in New Zealand for possession of marijuana. Lewis pleaded guilty to three charges and paid a substantial fine, though under New Zealand law he was not required to serve time in jail or prison. According to his lawyer, Marie Dyhrberg, Lewis used the marijuana on the advice of his doctor for pain relief after the partial amputation of his leg in 1998.\\"Eccentric billionaire has high profile at home\\" by Josie Clarke, The New Zealand Herald, August 31, 2000 Personal life In 1955, Lewis married Toby Devan.

(1978). Arms and the Wizard. Lloyd George and the Ministry of Munitions 1915 - 1916, London: Cassell & Co Ltd. . Particularly, Chapter 8: The Women's Part. The British textile and clothing trades, in particular, employed far more women than men and were regarded as 'women's work'. During WWII, in total, 6 million women were added to the workforce in what resulted as a major cultural shift. With the men fighting in the wars, women were needed to take on responsibilities that the men had to leave behind. While some women managed to enter the traditionally male career paths, women, for the most part, were expected to be primarily involved in \\"duties at home\\" and \\"women's work\\". Before 1914, only a few countries, including New Zealand, Australia, and several Scandinavian nations, had given women the right to vote (see Women's suffrage), but otherwise, women were minimally involved in the political process. The two world wars hinged as much on industrial production as they did on battlefield clashes. With millions of men away fighting and with the inevitable casualties, there was a severe shortage of labour in a range of industries, from rural and farm work to urban office jobs. During both world wars women were needed by the national war effort to undertake new roles. In Great Britain, this was known as a process of \\"Dilution\\" and was strongly contested by the trade unions, particularly in the engineering and ship building industries. For the duration of both World Wars, women sometimes did take on skilled \\"men's work\\". However, in accordance with the agreement negotiated with the trade unions, women undertaking jobs covered by the Dilution agreement lost their jobs at the end of the First World War. World War I The United States Navy began accepting women for enlisted service during World War I =Home front= By 1914 nearly 5.09 million out of the 23.8 million women in Britain were working. Thousands worked in munitions factories (see Canary girl), offices and large hangars used to build aircraft. Women were also involved in knitting socks for the soldiers on the front, as well as other voluntary work, but as a matter of survival women had to work for paid employment for the sake of their families. Many women worked as volunteers serving at the Red Cross, encouraged the sale of war bonds or planted \\"victory gardens\\". Not only did women have to keep \\"the home fires burning\\" but they took on voluntary and paid employment that was diverse in scope and showed that women were capable in diverse fields of endeavour. There is little doubt this expanded the view of the role of women in society and changed the outlook of what women could do and their place in the workforce. Although women were still paid less than men in the workforce, pay inequalities were starting to diminish as women were now getting paid two- thirds of the typical pay for men, a 28% increase. However, the extent of this change is open to historical debate. In part because of female participation in the war effort Canada, the United States, Great Britain, and a number of European countries extended suffrage to women in the years after the First World War. British historians no longer emphasize the granting of woman suffrage as a reward for women's participation in war work. Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age- restricted women's suffrage. The suffragettes had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganizing effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.Martin D. Pugh, \\"Politicians and the Women's Vote 1914-1918,\\" History, October 1974, Vol. 59 Issue 197, pp 358-374 More generally, G. R. Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.G. R. Searle, A New England? Peace and war, 1886-1918 (2004) p 791 =Military service= Nursing became almost the only area of female contribution that involved being at the front and experiencing the war. In Britain the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and Voluntary Aid Detachment were all started before World War I. The VADs were not allowed in the front line until 1915. More than 12,000 women enlisted in auxiliary roles in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during the First World War. About 400 of them died in that war. Over 2,800 women served with the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps during the First World War and it was during that era that the role of Canadian women in the military first extended beyond nursing. Women were given paramilitary training in small arms, drill, first aid and vehicle maintenance in case they were needed as home guards. Forty-three women in the Canadian military died during WWI. The only belligerent to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was the Russian Provisional Government in 1917. Its few \\"Women's Battalions\\" fought well, but failed to provide the propaganda value expected of them and were disbanded before the end of the year. In the later Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks would also employ women infantry. In the 1918 Finnish Civil War, more than 2,000 women fought in the paramilitary Women's Red Guards. World War II In many nations women were encouraged to join female branches of the armed forces or participate in industrial or farm work. =United States= Women in World War II took on a variety of roles from country to country. World War II involved global conflict on an unprecedented scale; the absolute urgency of mobilizing the entire population made the expansion of the role of women inevitable. The hard skilled labor of women was symbolized in the United States by the concept of Rosie the Riveter, a woman factory laborer performing what was previously considered man's work. With this expanded horizon of opportunity and confidence, and with the extended skill base that many women could now give to paid and voluntary employment, women's roles in World War II were even more extensive than in the First World War. By 1945, more than 2.2 million women were working in war industries, especially in munitions plants. They participated in the building of ships, aircraft, vehicles, and weaponry. Women also worked on farms, drove trucks, provided logistic support for soldiers and entered professional areas of work that were previously the preserve of men. In the Allied countries thousands of women enlisted as nurses serving in the front line units. Thousands of others joined defensive militias at home and there was a great increase in the number of women serving for the military itself, particularly in the Soviet Union's Red Army. During World War II, approximately 400,000 U.S. women served in support positions with the armed forces and more than 460 ‚Äî some sources say the figure is closer to 543 ‚Äî lost their lives as a result of the war, including 16 from enemy fire. Women became officially recognized as a permanent part of the U.S. armed forces after the war with the passing of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948. The ability for women to be involved overseas opened doors for many underrepresented groups, including Latinas, to serve their country. Out of one million African Americans serving in WWII, 600,000 of them were women. 4,000 of these women served in the Women's Army Corps and 330 of these women served as nurses. African American women also fought for African American rights through media, social activism, etc. A person's race was heavily divided and in the year 1943, there were a documented 242 violent events against African Americans regardless of whether they served in the war efforts or not. =Europe= Several hundred thousand women in countries including Britain and the Soviet Union served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The U.S. decided not to use women in combat because public opinion would not tolerate it. Germany had presented an ideal female role at home, but the urgent need for war production led to the hiring of millions of German women for factory and office work.Karen Hagemann, \\"Mobilizing Women for War: The History, Historiography, and Memory of German Women‚Äôs War Service in the Two World Wars,\\" Journal of Military History 75:3 (2011): 1055-1093 Many women served in the resistances of Yugoslavia, Poland, France, and Italy, and in the British SOE and American OSS which aided these. Approximately 2 million Jewish women in the Holocaust were killed, and the Nazis also killed other women who belonged to groups they were committing genocide against, such as women with disabilities and Roma women. =Asia and Pacific= Women, called comfort women, were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. Korean women were especially used.George Hicks, The Comfort Women: Japan's brutal regime of enforced prostitution in the Second World War (WW Norton & Company, 1997). But a far greater number of women worked in war industry than in sex slavery. Women in Japan and Korea also performed industrial labor duties during the war. They helped make bombs and guns and airplanes, etc. Australia Australian women during World War II played a larger role than they had during The First World War, when they primarily served as nurses and additional homefront workers. Many women wanted to play an active role in the war, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942. Women entered roles which had traditionally been limited to men, but continued to receive lower wages.Patsy Adam-Smith, Australian Women At War (Penguin, Melbourne, 1996). =Canada= Canadian women in the World Wars became indispensable because the World Wars were total wars that required the maximum effort of the civilian population. While Canadians were deeply divided on the issue of conscription for men, there was wide agreement that women had important new roles to play in the home, in civic life, in industry, in nursing, and even in military uniforms. Historians debate whether there was much long-term impact on the postwar roles of women.Jean Bruce, Back the Attack!: Canadian Women During the Second World War, at Home and Abroad (Macmillan of Canada, 1985).

It includes regional economic policy, regional social policy, regional environmental policy, regional political policy, regional cultural policy, etc.Regional policy aims to improve economic conditions in regions of relative disadvantage, either within a nation or within a supranational grouping such as the European Union. Additionally, a regional policy may try to address high levels of unemployment and lower-than-average per capita incomes. Its main tool is public investment. Regional policy in the European Union Although the European Union is one of the richest parts of the world, there are large internal disparities of income and opportunity between its regions. The May 2004 Enlargement, followed by accession of Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007, has widened these gaps. Regional policy transfers resources from richer to poorer regions. ‚ÄúRegional policy targets all regions and cities in the European Union in to support job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development, and improve citizens‚Äô quality of life.‚Äù The argument for regional policy is that it is both an instrument of financial solidarity and a powerful force for economic integration. =Regional policy in Italy= The major Italian experience of regional policy is the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, set up in the mid-1950s to foster economic development in southern Italy. Originally intended to last for six months, it survived until 1984. New roads, irrigation projects and developments in infrastructure were built in an area where local communities had suffered seriously from poverty, de-population and high levels of emigration. Tourism projects attempted to exploit Calabria‚Äôs beaches. =Regional policy in the United Kingdom= UK regional policy was born during the economic depression of the 1930s, when heavy industries in the north were devastated. \\"Assisted Areas\\" were established, within which companies could acquire grants or capital allowances ‚Äì known as Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) ‚Äì in return for protecting jobs. The overall pattern of policy changed little in the next forty years. Despite criticism by a 1970s Royal Commission that it was \\"Empiricism run mad; a game of hit and miss played with more enthusiasm than success\\", governments of both parties maintained Assisted Areas. Under the 1980s Thatcher government, regional policy was significantly rolled back, with Assisted Areas substantially reduced in size. The post-1997 Labour administration reorganised regional policy, with RSA replaced by Selective Finance for Investment in England and Scotland. UK policy has been subject to EU regional policy framework, with its strong injunctions against unfair competition (generally meaning state aid). Regional policy in the United States * Tennessee Valley Authority * Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Regional policy in China In China, regional policy is delivered through multi-level governance that involves central government, provinces, counties, townships and villages. The key role in regional policy and regional development plays The Department of Regional Economy under the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).The development of regional policy in China can be divided into three stages. Balanced development in the early 30 years of New China (1949-1978) The balanced development policy implemented in the early 30 years of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a process of the top-down one-way directive plan. The central government uses the national financial resources to implement major projects (infrastructure, national defense), carry out investment and construction, and adjust and control the layout of productivity. From the spatial level, it carries out strategic planning, guidance and control characterized by the unity of regional development. It established a number of industrial bases with initial scale, and laid the foundation for China's industrialization construction. However, the industrial development at that time was mainly based on the needs of national security strategy. It was distributed in the scattered mountainous areas, with the priority given to heavy industry, especially military industry. The development of light industry was insufficient, and there was a shortage of materials. In addition, the tendency of \\"attaching importance to the mainland but less to the coast\\" in the application of the balanced development policy has restrained the economic development. Unbalanced development in reform and opening up (1979-1998) At the end of 1978, China began the historical process of reform and opening up, and profoundly summed up the lessons of the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" and the disadvantages of planned economy. During this period, unbalanced development was highly praised, which basically dominated the economic layout and regional development of China. In order to make some areas rich first, it encourages coastal cities and regions with low cost, quick effect, easy project landing and convenient foreign trade to develop first, and open up the riverside, belt and inland areas in stages, with emphasis and efficiency. Specific measures include establishment of special economic zones, economic and technological development zones and coastal port cities, etc. Coordinated development since the new millennium (1999-) At this stage, China implements the regional policy of \\"four plates\\" and \\"three support belts\\" as a whole, and promotes coordinated and complementary development among regions and narrow the regional economic gap under the guidance of major strategies. Specific measures include The Belt and Road Initiative, the development of the \\"Beijing Tianjin Hebei\\", the Yangtze River economic belt, the development of the Yangtze River economic belt, the construction of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. After more than 20 years of reform and opening up, the unbalanced development strategy is oriented by \\"efficiency\\" and adopts the policy of inclining to the East, which promotes the rapid development of economic core areas such as the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta and the Bohai rim, and economic growth poles such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. However, the regional development gap between the East and the West has gradually widened, a series of contradictions such as resource allocation, ecological environment, ethnic relations and regional competition have been intensified, and regional economic problems have become increasingly prominent. The thinking of China's regional economic development has turned to the coordinated and balanced way of \\"maintaining the priority development momentum of the eastern region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions\\". ThereforeÔºåWestern development and Northeast Revitalization and The rise of Central China and the first development of Eastern China are two main regional policy directions. Specific Regional Policy Special economic zone In 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping first proposed the establishment of \\"export special zone\\". In 1990, the State Council approved the establishment of Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, the first free trade zone in New China. In 2001, China joined the WTO to participate in international competition and cooperation. Since 2003, the State Council has issued a series of documents to build an energy-saving society. The development mode of low-carbon economy has become China's transformation of economic development mode and adjustment China (Shanghai) pilot Free Trade Zone, the first free trade zone in China, was officially established in 2013. The policy includes related keywords as bonded zone, western development, free trade zone, scientific and technological innovation, WTO entry, low-carbon economy, regional preferential policies, foreign direct investment. Main functional areas China's regional economy has formed an overall strategy of \\"four major plates\\" for the development of the west, the revitalization of the northeast, the rise of the central region and the first development of the East. The main functional areas are the implementation of the overall strategy of regional development. The land and space are divided into four categories: optimized development, key development, restricted development and prohibited development. The policy includes keywords such as coordinated development, cultivated land protection, the rise of Central China, industrial agglomeration, tax preference, public services, economic compensation, ecological compensation, revitalization of Northeast China, and circular economy. One belt and one road One belt and one road, Silk Road Economic Belt & 21st century maritime Silk Road, is a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013 involving infrastructure development and investments in nearly 70 countries and international organizations in Asia, Europe, and Africa.

Keratin 6A was the first type II keratin sequence determined. Analysis of the sequence of this keratin together with that of the first type I keratin led to the discovery of the four helical domains in the central rod of keratins. In humans Keratin 6A is encoded by the KRT6A gene.  Keratins  Keratins are the intermediate filament proteins that form a dense meshwork of filaments throughout the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Keratins form heteropolymers consisting of a type I and a type II keratin. Keratins are generally expressed in particular pairs of type I and type II keratin proteins in a tissue- specific and cellular differentiation-specific manner. The keratin proteins of epithelial tissues are commonly known as \\"keratins\\" or are sometimes referred to as \\"epithelial keratins\\" or \\"cytokeratins\\". The specialized keratins of hair and nail are known as \\"hard keratins\\" or \\"trichocyte keratins\\". Trichocytes are the specialized epithelial cells from which hair and nail are composed. Trichocyte keratins are similar in their gene and protein structure to keratins except that they are especially rich in the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, which facilitates chemical cross-linking of the assembled hard keratins to form a more structurally resilient material. Both epithelial keratins and hard keratins can be further subdivided into type I (acidic) keratins and type II (neutral-basic) keratins. The genes for the type I keratins are located in a gene cluster on human chromosome 17q, whereas the genes for type II keratins are located in a cluster on human chromosome 12q (the exception being K18, a type I keratin located in the type II gene cluster).  Keratin 6A  Keratin 6A (protein name K6A; gene name KRT6A), is a type II cytokeratin, one of a number of isoforms of keratin 6 encoded by separate genes located within the type II keratin gene cluster on human chromosome 12q. It is found with keratin 16 and/or keratin 17 in the palm and sole epidermis, the epithelial cells of the nail bed, the filiform papillae of the tongue, the epithelial lining of oral mucosa and esophagus, as well as the hair follicles. This keratin 6 isoform is thought to be the most abundant of the K6 isoforms. The KRT6A gene consists of 9 exons separated by 8 introns and is located in the type II keratin gene cluster on human chromosome 12q. Keratin 6B and keratin 6C are encoded by the neighbouring genes, which are identical in intron-exon organization to KRT6A and are more than 99% identical in their DNA coding sequences. Keratin 6A has been shown to have antimicrobial properties, and is the main antimicrobial factor in the eye.https://news.berkeley.edu/2012/09/24/antimicrobial-keratins-in-eye/  Genetic disorders  Mutations in the genes expressing this protein is associated with the PC-K6A subtype of pachyonychia congenita, an inherited disorder of the epithelial tissues in which keratin 6A is expressed, particularly leading to structural abnormalities of the nails, the epidermis of the palms and soles, and oral epithelia.

The most popular, the S-100 class, were very seaworthy,PT-Boat.com‚ÄìGerman S-100 Class Schnellboot (Fast Boat) heavily armed and capable of sustaining , briefly accelerating to .PT- Boat.com‚ÄìGerman S-100 Class Schnellboot (Fast Boat): . They were armed with torpedoes and Flak guns (one 37mm at the stern and at least one 20mm at the bow) plus machine guns; some had 40mm cannon. These craft were long and in beam. Their diesel engines provided a range of , substantially greater than the gasoline-fueled American PT boats and British motor torpedo boats (MTBs).Tent, James F. E-Boat Alert: Defending the Normandy Invasion Fleet (Annapolis, Naval Institute Press, 1996), p. 39 As a result, the Royal Navy later developed better-matched MTBs, using the Fairmile 'D' hull design.  History  = Development = This design was chosen because the theatre of operations of such boats was expected to be the North Sea, English Channel and the Western Approaches. The requirement for good performance in rough seas dictated the use of a round-bottomed displacement hull rather than the flat- bottomed planing hull that was more usual for small, high-speed boats. The shipbuilding company L√ºrssen overcame many of the disadvantages of such a hull and, with the Oheka II, produced a craft that was fast, strong and seaworthy. This attracted the interest of the Reichsmarine, which in 1929 ordered a similar boat but fitted with two torpedo tubes. This became the S-1, and was the basis for all subsequent E-boats. After experimenting with the S-1, the Germans made several improvements to the design. Small rudders added on either side of the main rudder could be angled outboard to 30 degrees, creating at high speed what is known as the L√ºrssen Effect. This drew in an \\"air pocket slightly behind the three propellers, increasing their efficiency, reducing the stern wave and keeping the boat at a nearly horizontal attitude\\". This was an important innovation as the horizontal attitude lifted the stern, allowing even greater speed, and the reduced stern wave made E-boats harder to see, especially at night. = Operations with the Kriegsmarine = E-boats, a British designation using the letter E for Enemy, were primarily used to patrol the Baltic Sea and the English Channel in order to intercept shipping heading for the English ports in the south and east. As such, they were up against Royal Navy and Commonwealth, e.g., Royal Canadian Navy contingents leading up to D-Day, motor gunboats (MGBs), motor torpedo boats (MTBs), motor launches, frigates and destroyers. They were also transferred in small numbers to the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea by river and land transport. Some small E-boats were built as boats for carrying by auxiliary cruisers. Crew members could earn an award particular to their work‚ÄîDas Schnellbootkriegsabzeichen‚Äîdenoted by a badge depicting an E-boat passing through a wreath. The criteria were good conduct, distinction in action, and participating in at least twelve enemy actions. It was also awarded for particularly successful missions, displays of leadership or being killed in action. It could be awarded under special circumstances, such as when another decoration was not suitable. E-boats of the 6th & 9th flotillas from Cherbourg attacked Exercise Tiger on 28 April 1944, causing about 749 American Army and Navy casualties. E-boats of the 9th flotilla were the first naval units to respond to the invasion fleet of Operation Overlord. They left Cherbourg harbour at 5 a.m. on 6 June 1944. On finding themselves confronted by the entire invasion fleet, they fired their torpedoes at maximum range and returned to Cherbourg. During World War II, E-boats claimed 101 merchant ships totalling 214,728 tons.Connelly & Krakow, 2003. p.54 Additional claims include 12 destroyers, 11 minesweepers, eight landing ships, six MTBs, one torpedo boat, one minelayer, one submarine, and a number of smaller craft such as fishing boats. They also damaged two cruisers, five destroyers, three landing ships, one repair ship, one naval tug, and numerous other merchant vessels. Sea mines laid by the E-boats were responsible for the loss of 37 merchant ships totalling 148,535 tons, a destroyer, two minesweepers, and four landing ships. In recognition of their service, the members of E-boat crews were awarded 23 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and 112 German Cross in Gold. Operations in the Black Sea In order to boost Axis naval strength in the Black Sea, the OKW ordered to the region the transfer of six E-boats of the 1st S-flotilla, the last to be released from action in the Baltic Sea before refit. The Romanian port of Constan»õa, in the Black Sea, was elected as the S-flotilla's headquarters. Transporting the six boats overland from Germany to Romania was an impressive logistical feat. The superstructure and all weapons were removed, leaving only the hull. After a long road journey of 60 hours, the boats arrived at Ingolstadt, where they were transferred back to water and towed towards Linz.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 234 Upon reaching the Austrian city, the superstructure was rebuilt, then the journey continued down the Danube to Gala»õi, where the main engines were installed. The E-boats then continued on their own power towards Constan»õa, where refitting was completed. The first two boats, S-26 and S-28, arrived in Constan»õa on 24 May 1942, the second pair, S-72 and S-102 on 3 June, and the final pair, S-27 and S-40 10 days later.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 235 After the sinking of S-27 by a malfunctioning torpedo, four more reserve boats, S-47, S-49, S-51, S-52 were dispatched to the Black Sea, in order to replace boats undergoing maintenance.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 241 S-28, S-72 and S-102 were soon relegated to the Constan»õa Shipyard for engine replacement, leaving only S-26 and the newly commissioned S-49 operational.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 250 On 1 January 1944, the 1st S-flotilla numbered six operational boats: S-26, S-42, S-47, S-49, S-52 and S-79 while S-28, S-40, S-45 and S-51 were all out of commission, undergoing repair in Constan»õa. Three more boats were shipped down the Danube and were being reconstructed at Constan»õa.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 259 On 1 June 1944, 8 boats were operational in Constan»õa: S-28, S-40, S-47, S-49, S-72, S-131, S-148 and S-149. The boats were however penned in harbor, due to fuel shortage. During July, S-26, S-28, S-40 and S-42 were transferred to Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, where S-42 was fitted with a new propeller. They were joined by S-72 in early August, the rest of the boats remaining in Constan»õa. On 19 August, S-26, S-40 and S-72 were destroyed in port by a Soviet air attack. On 22 August S-148 hit a mine and sank near Sulina, and on the following day, S-42, S-52 and S-131 were destroyed in Constan»õa by a Soviet air attack.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 261 What remained of the S-flotilla was disbanded after Romania switched sides on the same day.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, p. 262 =Italian MS boat= Italian MS 472, post-war configuration The poor seaworthiness of the Italian-designed MAS boats of World War I and early World War II led its navy to build its own version of E-boats, the CRDA 60 t type, classed MS (Motosilurante). The prototype was designed on the pattern of six German-built E-boats captured from the Yugoslav Navy in 1941. Two of them sank the British light cruiser in August 1942, the largest victory by fast torpedo craft in the Second World War. After the war these boats served with the Italian Navy, some well into the 1970s. = Service in the Spanish Navy = The Kriegsmarine supplied the Spanish Francoist Navy with six E-boats during the Spanish Civil War, and six more during the Second World War. Another six were built in Spain with some assistance from L√ºrssen. A motor boat of the early series, either the Falange or the Requet√©, laid two mines off Almer√≠a that crippled the British destroyer HMS Hunter on 13 May 1937. The German-built boats were discarded in the 1960s, while some of the Spanish-built ones served until the early 1970s.Coello, J.L. (1995). Buques de la Armada espa√±ola a√±os de la postguerra. S.L. AGUALARGA EDITORES, = Service in China = This is one of the S-7-class boats, S-13. The Chinese Navy operated three boats of this class. The Chinese Nationalist Navy had three S-7-class boats during the Second Sino-Japanese War. *Yue-22 (Â≤≥-22) *Yue-253 (Â≤≥-253) *Yue-371 (Â≤≥-371) Yue-22 was destroyed by Japanese planes, Yue-371 was sunk by its sailors to avoid being captured by the Japanese soldiers and Yue-253 was captured by the People's Liberation Army during the Chinese civil war. Yue-253 was renamed \\"HOIKING\\"(Êµ∑ÈØ®), its meaning is \\"SEAWHALE\\". The People's Liberation Army Navy used it as a patrol boat until 1963. The Chinese Nationalist government also ordered eight S-30-class E-boats and a tender, Qi Jiguang (ÊàöÁπºÂÖâ). These were taken over by the Kriegsmarine in 1939. Qi Jiguang was renamed '. =Service in the Romanian Navy= Germany sold four E-boats to Romania on 14 August 1944.CrƒÉciunoiu, Cristian. Romanian navy torpedo boats (Modelism Publishing, 2003), pp. 154-155. These vessels displaced 65 tons, had a top speed of 30 knots generated by three Mercedes-Benz engines totalling 2,850 hp and were armed with two 500 mm (19.7 inch) torpedo tubes. Each of the four boats had a crew of 25. They were numbered 10 to 13 (formerly S-151, S-152, S-153 and S-154) and served in the Romanian Navy until at least 1954.Jane's fighting ships: 1953-1954, Sampson Low, Marston, 1955, p. 294 = Post-war service =  Royal Navy  At the end of the war about 34 E-boats were surrendered to the British. Three boats, S-130 (renamed P5230), S-208 (P5208) and S-212 (P5212) were retained for trials. = Operation Jungle = The Gehlen Organization, an intelligence agency established by American occupation authorities in Germany in 1946 and manned by former members of the Wehrmacht's Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East), used Royal Navy's E-boats in order to infiltrate its agents into the Baltic states and Poland.H√∂hne, Heinz; Zolling, Hermann (1972). The General Was a Spy: The Truth about General Gehlen and his spy ring. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan. pp. 150-53. Royal Navy Commander Anthony Courtney was struck by the potential capabilities of former E-boat hulls, and John Harvey-Jones of the Naval Intelligence Division was put in charge of the project. He discovered that the Royal Navy still had two E-boats, P5230 and P5208, and had them sent to Portsmouth, where one of them, P5230 (ex-S130), was modified to reduce its weight and increase its power with the installation of two Napier Deltic engines of 2,500 hp apiece. Lieutenant- Commander Hans-Helmut Klose was assigned to command a German crew, recruited by the British MI-6 and funded by the American Office of Policy Coordination. The missions were assigned the codename \\"Operation Jungle\\". The boats carried out their missions under the cover of the British Control Commission's Fishery Protection Service, which was responsible for preventing Soviet navy vessels from interfering with German fishing boats and for destroying stray mines. The home port of the boats was Kiel, and operated under the supervision of Harvey- Jones. Manned by Klose and his crew, they usually departed for the island of Bornholm waving the White Ensign, where they would hoist the Swedish flag for a dash to Gotland, and there they would wait for orders from Hamburg. The first mission consisted in the landing of Lithuanian agents at Palanga, Lithuania, in May 1949,Dorril, Stephen (2002). MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service. Simon and Schuster, pp. 190-91. and the last one took place in April 1955 in Saaremaa, Estonia. During the last two years of the operation, three new German-built motorboats replaced the old E-boats. Klose was later assigned the command of a patrol boat in the Bundesmarine and became commander-in-chief of the fleet before his retirement in 1978.Adams, Jefferson (2009). Historical Dictionary of German Intelligence. Scarecrow Press, pp. 234-35.  Royal Danish Navy  In 1947, the Danish navy bought twelve former Kriegsmarine boats. These were further augmented in 1951 by six units bought from the Royal Norwegian Navy. The last unit, the P568 Viben, was retired in 1965.  Royal Norwegian Navy  After World War II, the Norwegian Navy received a number of former Kriegsmarine boats. Six boats were transferred to Denmark in 1951. = Operators =    *  Survivor  There is just one surviving E-boat, identified as S-130. It was built as hull No. 1030 at the Schlichting boatyard in Travem√ºnde, S-130 was commissioned on 21 October 1943 and took an active part in the war, participating in the Exercise Tiger attack and attacks on the D-day invasion fleet. According to Dutch military historian Maurice Laarman: > In 1945, S-130 was taken as a British war prize (FPB 5030) and put to use in > covert operations. Under the guise of the \\"British Baltic Fishery Protection > Service\\", the British Secret Intelligence Service MI-6 ferried spies and > agents into Eastern Europe.

The operations were very successful and continued under > a more permanent organisation based in Hamburg. In 1952, S-130 joined the > operation and the mission was enlarged to include signal intelligence > (SIGINT) equipment. In 1954/55, S-130 and S-208 were replaced by a new > generation of German S-boote. S-130 was returned to the newly formed Bundesmarine in March 1957, and operated under the number UW 10. Serving initially in the Unterwasserwaffenschule training sailors in underwater weaponry such as mines and torpedoes, she later became a test boat under the name EF 3. S-130 was on display in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, formerly used as a houseboat. S-130 was purchased and towed from Wilhelmshaven, Germany, to the Husbands Shipyard, Marchwood, Southampton, England in January 2003, under the auspices of the British Military Powerboat Trust. In 2004, S-130 was taken to the slipway at Hythe, where, under the supervision of the BMPT, she was prepared and then towed to Mashfords yard in Cremyll, Cornwall, England to await funding for restoration. In 2008, S-130, having been purchased by \\"Wheatcroft Collection\\", set up ashore at Southdown in Cornwall to undergo restoration work involving Roving Commissions Ltd. As of June 2012, this work continues and includes an S130 Members' Club.  Variants  The Schnellboot design evolved over time.

It is a medium-sized community mall with about 90 stores. Roughly 7.5 million people visit the mall every year and sales were about $527/sq foot. When built it was the first strip mall in Ottawa, although it has since become an enclosed mall. It is located immediately south of the Rideau River on the corner of Bank Street and Riverside Drive, beside a large athletic facility, the RA Centre. The anchor stores are Walmart and Your Independent Grocer. History It opened in 1954 as \\"the first one-stop shopping destination to serve all of the City of Ottawa\\" according to its owners. At it was Ottawa's first strip plaza. When it was built it had only six stores, of which only Reitmans remains to this day. CIBC and Fairweather were also very early tenants which remain. Twenty stores in the mall were staying open past 6 pm on weekdays, the required time of closure by City of Ottawa by-law. As of 1956, the six units that took the municipality to court lost their appeal in court. The mall opened an expansion in November 1961, and another in March 1962, the latter bringing it to 33 stores. This made it one of Ottawa's largest shopping centres. The parking lot also expanded from 500 spots to 1400. The 1962 addition added an Ogilvy's department store, the first in a shopping centre, Steinberg's, and a Woolworth's. A 1961 Ottawa Citizen article covering a mall expansion claimed \\"the new centre by its accessibility to through highways, will become not only one of the largest shopping plazas in the district but one of the finest in the country.\\" Ottawa department store Ogilvy's opened a location at Billings Bridge in the 1962 expansion. Ogilvy's was replaced by Robinson's, which was replaced by discount retailer Zellers in 1996, by Target Canada in 2013 and Walmart Canada in May 2016. It did not become an enclosed mall until 1972 and a twelve-storey office tower was added during an expansion in 1975. In the late 1990s, a \\"remerchandizing program\\" brought in a number of new stores to replace old ones and \\"provide the proper tenant mix to suit this particular trade area and the shopping centre's customer base.\\" In 1998‚Äì99 extensive renovations were carried out at a cost of $7 million; they added a new glass two-storey atrium as a main entrance, a modern food court, and an \\"updated look\\". In July 2006, another major renovation programme was started which expanded the mall by . In 2004 Brian Card, president of Corporate Research Group argued, \\"Billings Bridge's proximity to public transit, office buildings and growing population centres has helped it to withstand competition from big-box power centres when other shopping centres have been hard-hit.\\" A 2005 article by Ottawa Business Journal quoted 'experts' saying that the \\"lack of a major anchor department store has kept it from becoming a regional centre.\\" In 2004 Barry Nabatian, general manager of Market Research Corporation, argued that the South Keys Shopping Centre had taken the role as 'regional mall' in the south of Ottawa, as it was larger, more popular, and had higher sales/sq foot. Today the mall is considered a 'community' shopping centre. On October 2, 2017, a shooting took place inside the mall following an altercation.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/police-investigate-shooting- billings-bridge-1.4317596 Location The shopping centre is located on the Transitway, and serves as a major hub for OC Transpo bus services. The station is called Billings Bridge; it opened on November 2, 1996. Billings Bridge is named after Braddish Billings, an original settler of Ottawa. The bridge carrying Bank Street over the river, near the site of the current mall, came to be known as Billings' Bridge as it led to his property. The shopping centre is a popular location for students at Carleton University as it is easily accessible through public transit.

Trudeaumania continued during the subsequent federal election campaign and during Trudeau's early years as Prime Minister of Canada. Decades later, Trudeau's son, Justin Trudeau, drew a similar international reaction when he became Prime Minister himself in 2015.  Pierre Elliot Trudeau  Many young people in Canada at this time, especially young women, were influenced by the 1960s counterculture and identified with Trudeau, an energetic nonconformist who was relatively young. They were dazzled by his \\"charm and good looks\\", and a large fan base was established throughout the country. He would often be stopped in the streets for his autograph or for photographs. Trudeau had once sympathized with Marxists and had spent time in the democratic socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and many of his fans were attracted to his culturally liberal stances (he legalized homosexuality and created more flexible divorce laws as Justice Minister under Lester B. Pearson). Trudeau was also admired for his laid-back attitude and his celebrity relationships; in that word's prevailing use at the time, describing a modern, \\"hip and happening person\\", he was often described as a swinger. A high point happened during Trudeau's election campaign in 1968 during the annual Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montreal, when rioting Quebec separatists threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated. Rejecting the pleas of his aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the politician showing such courage impressed the Canadian people, and he handily won the election the next day.CBC Archives.

Trudeaumania began to abate after Prime Minister Trudeau married Margaret Sinclair in 1971, but he is still remembered as one of Canada's most polarizing politicians and prime ministers; fondly recalled by many Central and Eastern Canadians, but unpopular among conservative and nationalist thinkers, especially in Quebec and the western provinces. He was named the Canadian Newsmaker of the 20th Century by the Canadian Press at the dawn of the year 2000. When he died later that year, there was an outpouring of public grief, and he was again named Newsmaker of the Year for 2000 itself. In 2004, he was voted the third- Greatest Canadian by CBC viewers, after Terry Fox and Tommy Douglas. A Canadian board game of the early 1980s, \\"True Dough Mania\\", was titled with a pun on the phenomenon. The game was a satire on Canadian politics.

(; - 28 June 1922), was a Russian poet and playwright, a central part of the Russian Futurist movement, but his work and influence stretch far beyond it. Influential linguist Roman Jakobson hailed Khlebnikov as \\"the greatest world poet of our century\\".Roman Jakobson on Velimir Khlebnikov (in Russian) Biography Viktor Vladimirovich Khlebnikov was born in 1885 in Malye Derbety, Astrakhan Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Kalmykia). He was of Russian, Armenian and Zaporozhian Cossack descent.James R. Russell, \\"The Black Dervish of Armenian Futurism,\\" Journal of Armenian Studies, 10 His younger sister, Vera Khlebnikova, was an artist. He moved to Kazan, where he attended school. He then attended school in Saint Petersburg. He eventually quit school to become a full-time writer. His earliest works are from 1908. Velimir Khlebnikov, painted in 1910 by Mikhail Larionov In 1909-10, he met the to-be Russian Futurists Vasily Kamensky, David Burliuk, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. Soon Khlebnikov would belong to Hylaea, the most significant Russian Futurist group (along with Mayakovsky, Aleksei Kruchenykh, David Burliuk and Benedikt Livshits). However, he had already written many significant poems before the Futurist movement in Russia had taken shape. Among his contemporaries, he was regarded as \\"a poet's poet\\" (Mayakovsky referred to him as a \\"poet for producers\\") and a maverick genius. Khlebnikov was involved in the publication of A Slap in the Face of Public Taste in 1912, which was a critical component of the Russian futurism poetry. Khlebnikov is known for poems such as \\"Incantation by Laughter\\", \\"Bobeobi Sang The Lips\\", \\"The Grasshopper\\" (all 1908-1909), \\"Snake Train\\" (1910), the prologue to the Futurist opera Victory over the Sun (1913), dramatic works such as \\"Death's Mistake\\" (1915), prose works such as \\"Ka\\" (1915), and the so-called 'super- tale' (—Å–≤–µ—Ä—Ö–ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç—å) \\"Zangezi\\", a sort of ecstatic drama written partly in invented languages of gods and birds. He published Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907‚Äì1914 circa 1914. Kazimir Malevich and Pavel Filonov co- illustrated it. In his work, Khlebnikov experimented with the Russian language, drawing upon its roots to invent huge numbers of neologisms, and finding significance in the shapes and sounds of individual letters of Cyrillic. Along with Kruchenykh, he originated zaum, a language defying translation, which is probably used by birds. He wrote futurological essays about such things as the possible evolution of mass communication (\\"The Radio of the Future\\") and transportation and housing (\\"Ourselves and Our Buildings\\"). He described a world in which people live and travel about in mobile glass cubicles that can attach themselves to skyscraper-like frameworks, and in which all human knowledge can be disseminated to the world by radio and displayed automatically on giant book-like displays at streetcorners. In 1912, he also published a method to predict historical events; one of the examples given was a \\"collapse of an empire in 1917\\". Although Khlebnikov had supported the 1917 Russian Revolution and shared many of its utopian visions, his works were criticized by the Soviets for not conforming to the strictures of socialist realism. In 1921 he was able to travel to Persia; excited at his arrival, he wrote poems chronicling exciting events and the sights around him. He also made friends with several dervishes. He was forced to go back to Russia in August that year. In his final years, Khlebnikov became fascinated with Slavic mythology and Pythagorean numerology, drawing up long \\"Tables of Destiny\\" decomposing historical intervals and dates into functions of the numbers 2 and 3. Khlebnikov died while a guest in the house of his friend Pyotr Miturich near Kresttsy, in June 1922. There has been no medical diagnosis of his last illness; he suffered from gangrene and paralysis (he seems not to have recovered the use of his legs after his 1920 hospitalization in Kharkov), and it has been suggested that he died of blood poisoning or toxemia.Collected Works of Velimir Khlebnikov: Letters and Theoretical Writings (Harvard University Press, 1987; ), p. 33, n. 98.

Plot =Series 1= The series begins in 1895 with Dr. Eleanor Bramwell, working in a London hospital. She is treated as an inferior by the male doctors, and her opinions are often ignored. After a disagreement with a senior doctor, Eleanor is dismissed. Her father, Dr. Robert Bramwell, recommends she join him in his private practice of rich, elderly clients. Fortunately, Eleanor receives a better offer. Lady Peters, a friend of the family, offers to fund a small hospital in a London slum, where Eleanor will treat the impoverished locals. Together, Eleanor and Lady Peters establish The Thrift, a free hospital with six beds. The Thrift is named for its location on Thrift Street. The staff of the hospital rapidly expands. Stiff, serious Nurse Carr is hired to assist Eleanor, and Mr. Bentley, a former patient with an amputated foot, is hired to act as a porter. Eleanor quickly finds the hospital desperately requires an anaesthetist but has little money to pay for one. She begs a former colleague, Dr. Joe Marsham to work at The Thrift part-time and he agrees on the condition that he will be able to perform surgery as well (which he does free in order to enhance his skills). The first series focuses on the ups and downs of The Thrift. Each episode usually focuses on one patient or event occurring at The Thrift. Social issues of the time are often tackled such as racism, alcoholism or the conditions in the workhouse. Near the end of the season, it appears that Eleanor will be married to a family friend but breaks the engagement when she realises she will be forced to give up her work. As the season closes, Lady Peters becomes seriously ill. Her personal physician misdiagnoses her condition and by the time her true condition is realised, it is too late to save her. After her death, her fortune is left to The Thrift. =Series 2= In the Second Series, The Thrift attempts to survive without Lady Peters' guidance, management and financial assistance. A new character, Dr. Finn O'Neill is introduced when a cholera epidemic occurs in the area and Finn assists in the hospital. Eleanor, Robert and Dr. Marsham intensely dislike Finn and blame him for the death of a patient. Mr. Bentley also falls ill and because of a miscalculation in medication dosages, dies of poisoning. To assist the impoverished Bentley family, Eleanor hires Mr. Bentley's teenage son, Sidney, to act as the porter. Eleanor, despite her original opinions of Dr. O'Neill, falls in love with him in the last episode of the season. They enjoy a brief romance but are soon separated. Finn is forced to take a two- year position in Chicago but promises to marry Eleanor on his return. Robert Bramwell disapproves of Eleanor's relationship with Finn and is shocked when Eleanor admits she consummated the relationship with Finn. The usually close and happy relationship between Eleanor and her father is severely strained. =Series 3= Series Three begins a year after Finn's leaving. He has returned to England for a conference and takes this opportunity to visit Eleanor. Eleanor confirms that she still wishes to be married to Finn in a year when he permanently returns to England. Mr. Marsham considers taking a better position in Edinburgh, but remains at The Thrift when his wife is diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancer is too advanced to save her and she dies in Dr. Marsham's arms. Finn returns, but with shocking news. He has married a young daughter of an American colleague. Eleanor is crushed by the news and is forced to take a vacation from The Thrift. The Thrift struggles to manage without her for several months while she stays in the countryside with friends. It begins to appear that Eleanor, because of her fragile state, will never be able to work again, but she discovers a measles epidemic occurring in the village. The outbreak causes Eleanor to rediscover her passion for medicine and her strong personality. She returns to London. Eleanor is once more forced to see Finn when his new bride becomes sick. As Eleanor cares for her, Finn admits his marriage was purely for money and status. He suggests that Eleanor become his mistress so that he can enjoy the benefits of marriage while still having Eleanor. She refuses and insists she does not love him. In the meantime, Robert has become engaged to a wealthy widow, Alice Costigan. Robert attempts to insist that Eleanor stay with him and Alice once they move, but Eleanor refuses. Robert withdraws all financial support, leading Eleanor to propose to Dr. Marsham. He instead proposes to her, and she accepts. =Series 4= The fourth and final series included only two episodes and was dramatically different from the previous three series. Robert Bramwell and Alice Costigan make no appearance in the series, and their whereabouts are not mentioned. Sidney Bentley no longer appears but is replaced by another teenage porter, Tom. Tom appears in only one episode, before enlisting in the army. In the two episodes, Eleanor allows The Thrift to perform medical check-ups on soldiers, which leads to her meeting Major Quarrie. She and Marsham disagree about her decision and decide to end the engagement. Eleanor has an affair with Major Quarrie, despite their clearly different personalities and interests, resulting in a pregnancy. Eleanor makes plans to give the child up for adoption as Major Quarrie is not interested in marriage and will be going to fight in the Boer War in a fortnight. She becomes obsessed with locating the child of a patient at The Thrift and searches the slums. She ignores her responsibilities at The Thrift, alienates her friends and coworkers. Her behaviour forces the manager of The Thrift and Dr. Marsham to dismiss her. She is devastated. At the last minute, Major Quarrie leaves the military and proposes to Eleanor. She accepts his offer because she will be able to keep the child if she is married and because she loves him. Major Quarrie is also clearly besotted with Eleanor. The series ends at the church inside which the two will marry.

After working as a clerk for Congress in Washington D.C. to pay for his college studies, he graduated from the Columbian (now George Washington University) Law School in 1889. He became convinced that music could be made with electricity (and also worked on an electric typewriter). He showed his first teleharmonium to Lord Kelvin in 1902. That year he established a laboratory at Holyoke, where he was joined by his brother, Arthur T. Cahill. Telharmonium console, 1897. Cahill had tremendous ambitions for his invention; he wanted telharmonium music to be broadcast into hotels, restaurants, theaters, and even houses via the telephone line. At a starting weight of 7 tons (and up to 200 tons) and a price tag of $200,000 (approx. $5,514,000 today), only three telharmoniums were ever built, and Cahill's great vision was never fully implemented. His idea proved to be fruitful, nearly a century later, with the advent of streaming media.

Coleslaw prepared with vinaigrette may benefit from the long lifespan granted by pickling. History Purple cabbage coleslaw The term \\"coleslaw\\" arose in the 18th century as an anglicisation of the Dutch term \\"koolsla\\" (\\"kool\\" in Dutch sounds like \\"cole\\") meaning \\"cabbage salad\\".Perelman, Deb. (2007-08-08) \\"Coleslaw: You Could Be a Star\\". NPR. Accessed 2009-06-24. The \\"cole\\" part of the word comes from the Latin colis, meaning \\"cabbage\\". The 1770 recipe book The Sensible Cook: Dutch Foodways in the Old and New World contains a recipe attributed to the author's Dutch landlady, who mixed thin strips of cabbage with melted butter, vinegar, and oil. The recipe for coleslaw as it is most commonly prepared is fairly young, as mayonnaise was invented during the mid-18th century. According to The Joy of Cooking (1997), raw cabbage is the only entirely consistent ingredient in coleslaw; the type of cabbage, dressing, and added ingredients vary widely. Vinaigrette, mayonnaise, and sour cream based dressings are all listed; bacon, carrots, bell peppers, pineapple, pickles, onions, and herbs are specifically mentioned as possible added ingredients. Use Coleslaw is generally eaten as a side dish with foods such as fried chicken and barbecued meats and may be accompanied by French fries or potato salad as another side dish. It also may be used as a sandwich ingredient, being placed on barbecue sandwiches, hamburgers, and hot dogs along with chili and hot mustard. A vinegar-based coleslaw is the signature ingredient to a Primanti Brothers sandwich. Coleslaw also is used on a variant of the Reuben sandwich, with coleslaw substituting for the sauerkraut; the sandwich is commonly called a Rachel to differentiate it from the Reuben. Cabbage salad variations There are many variations of the recipe, which include the addition of other ingredients such as red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, mixed with a salad dressing such as mayonnaise or cream. A variety of seasonings, such as celery seed, may be added. The cabbage may come in finely minced pieces, shredded strips, or small squares. Other slaw variants include broccoli slaw, which uses shredded raw broccoli in place of the cabbage. Cream, sour cream, or buttermilk are also popular additions. Buttermilk coleslaw is most commonly found in the southern United States. Krautsalat in Munich, Germany Tyrolean cabbage and speck salad served warm =Germany= Traditional German Krautsalat consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar. Sometimes onions or apples are added. =Italy= Coleslaw with cooked ham and sliced pepper (julienne cut) in Italy is called insalata capricciosa (capricious salad). =Poland= Various cabbage-based salads that resemble coleslaw are commonly served as a side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white cabbage (red and Chinese cabbage are also not uncommon), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar, and tossed with a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to get rid of excess salty brine and similarly tossed with carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil. Any simple salad of that kind, i.e. one made with shredded raw vegetables, is known as a sur√≥wka ( 'raw'). If cabbage is the base ingredient, it is simply called a sur√≥wka z (kiszonej) kapusty, or a \\"(soured) cabbage salad\\". The English name \\"coleslaw\\" is mainly associated with the mayonnaise-dressed cabbage. It is often written as \\"coles≈Çaw\\" or \\"koles≈Çaw\\", because of the similarity to many names ending with \\"-s≈Çaw\\" (e.g. Boles≈Çaw). =Russia and Ukraine= Russian and Ukrainian variety dressed with sunflower oil In Russia and Ukraine, a salad of fresh shredded cabbage, mixed with carrots, apples, cranberries etc., is traditionally dressed with unrefined sunflower oil. The cabbage can be marinated before with vinegar producing cabbage proven√ßal (). A similar salad is also made of sauerkraut. =Sweden= In Sweden, a particular type of cabbage salad made with a vinaigrette consisting of vinegar or acetic acid (vinegar essence), vegetable oil, salt, and seasonings is classically served with pizza and known as pizzasallad (pizza salad).

Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in 1897 that a meeting of minds was really a fiction. The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a consensus ad idem (\\"agreement to the same [thing]\\") which is an undoubted requirement of synallagmatic contracting, and that this confusion may be the result of recent ignorance of Latin.R.

A mutual promise between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where legal remedies are to be used. Equally, any such agreement where the obligation is primarily a moral one rather than a legal one should not be enforceable. It is only when all parties involved are aware of the formation of a legal obligation is there a meeting of the minds. However, the awareness of a legal obligation is established, not through each party's subjective understanding of the terms, but on \\"objective indicators,\\" based on what each party said and did. Under the formalist theory of contract, every contract must have six elements: offer, acceptance, consideration, meeting of the minds, capacity and legality. Many other contracts, but not all types of contracts, also must be in writing and be signed by the responsible party, in an element called form.

Born in 1886, he lived in the time of the Russian Silver Age of literature, and together with Velimir Khlebnikov, another Russian Futurist, Kruchenykh is considered the inventor of zaum, a poetry style utilising nonsense words. Kruchonykh wrote the libretto for the Futurist opera Victory Over the Sun, with sets provided by Kazimir Malevich. In 1912, he wrote the book Dyr bul shchyl; four years later, in 1916, he created his most famous book, Universal War. He is also known for his Declaration of the Word as Such (1913): \\"The worn-out, violated word \\"lily\\" is devoid of all expression. Therefore I call the lily √©uy ‚Äì and original purity is restored.\\"George Steiner, After Babel, III, 3. Biography Kruchonykh was born on 21st February 1886, in the Kherson region of Russia. With the intention of becoming an artist, he went to Odessa Art School and the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, publishing caricatures and occasionally exhibiting to make a living, but changed his mind in 1912 to be a poet instead. Soon after he met the Burliuk brothers, he became a major poet of Cubo-Futurism, a style he helped to launch with his friends David Burliuk, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Mikhail Larionov, and others. He helped write the drafts for the most famous Cubo-Futurist manifesto, A Slap in the Face of Public Taste, published in 1912, notable for its statement to throw the writers of old \\"off the steamboat of modernity\\". The first example of zaum poetry was by him; called Dyr bul shchyl, it was published in a 1913 book called Pomada. Together with Velemir Khlebnikov, he is considered inventor of this poetry style. Kruchenykh was also the first Russian poet to try writing a poem only using vowels. Soon he became one of the most prolific Cubo-Futurist writers, alongside Elena Guro, Khlebnikov, and others. The books were often lithographed by hand, illustrated by fellow Futurists, and titles included A Little Duck's Nest of... Bad Words, Hermits: a Poem, Worldbackwards, and Explodity. They were also sometimes in collaboration with each other; for example, with Olga Rozanova, he invented the samopismo, a kind of Futurist book where text and images are literally connected. He went to the house of the composer Mikhail Matyushin with Kazimir Malevich that summer (Khlebnikov was supposed to visit him too, but he lost the cheque to pay for his train ticket that Matyushin had sent him); they collaborated to write the Futurist opera Victory over the Sun, with music by Matyushin, prologue by Khlebnikov, libretto by Kruchenykh, and set designs by Malevich. This opera remains his most famous work; it is about a group of Futurists who capture the sun and defy gravity, much to the annoyance to everybody else. It premiered at the Luna Park Theatre at St. Petersburg, in a performance organised by the Union of the Youth. This play was written in a sort of zaum, the costumes were of cardboard, and a real aeroplane and aviator made an appearance; the audience booed throughout the show, and overall it caused great outrage. He, like his friends, also caused shock when he took to lecturing and poetry recitals, and on one occasion, he had to use his shoes to fight back the enraged audience from leaping up and attacking him. Another time, he spilled tea over many of the audience, an event which was probably intentional. Universal War was published in 1916; he illustrated it himself, with abstract collages. During the war he served as a technical draftsman. Shortly after the October Revolution of 1917, he moved to Tifilis, Georgia, as part of a railway construction team; with his friend the Georgian Cubo- Futurist Ilia Zdanevich, who also happened to be in the country, they founded the avant-garde group 41‚Å∞ (the number refers to the temperature of a high fever). There, also, somebody founded an institute devoted to the study of his work and life so far, but this was probably just a joke. After Zdanevich left Georgia (first to Turkey, then to France), Krunonykh returned to Russia in 1921, publishing more books, writing essays, and lecturing with friends; his views soon became so shocking the authorities decided to restrict his access to publishers, so he made his books himself. When the Soviets banned the avant-garde, he got a job as an archivist and gave up poetry. He also collected and sold rare books and manuscripts written by the people of his generation, eventually falling into obscurity with only occasional acknowledgment from the public. In 1932 he wrote his memoirs. He died of pneumonia in 1968. Legacy The Russian punk band Grazhdanskaya Oborona have a reggae-styled song called \\"Posveshtenie A. Kruchyonykh\\" (Homage to A.

She won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in the individual event. She won a gold medal at the 2003 Trampoline World Championships in Hannover, Germany in the same event and a bronze in the team event. At the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics, she won a silver medal in the individual event. Background Cockburn was born in Toronto and grew up in North York, Ontario. She began trampolining at age 11, and is a student at York University. She is a member of the Skyriders Trampoline Place and is coached by Dave Ross. Following the Lake Placid and Quebec City World Cup competitions that took place in April 2007, the FIG World Rankings were updated. The women's ranking saw four time World Champion and five time World Cup Final winner Irina Karavaeva of Russia retake top place from Cockburn in Women's Individual Trampoline after Karavaeva won the gold medal at both of the World Cups. Cockburn and her partner, Rosannagh MacLennan, were ranked first in Women's Synchronised Trampoline following their two winning performances in 2007. Career After winning the Canadian National Trampoline Championships seven years in a row, Cockburn made an error in her second routine (of three) and came in 6th place in the 2005 finals on June 1, 2005. She was beaten by her partner in synchronized trampoline, Rosannagh MacLennan. Later in June, she competed in the Trampoline World Cup and came in 3rd in the individual competition and won gold in synchronized trampoline with Rosannagh MacLennan. In September 2005 at the Trampoline World Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, the pair came 2nd in synchronized trampoline and Cockburn came 6th in the individual event. In the 2006 Canadian National Trampoline championships in Quebec City, Cockburn regained her title beating MacLennan into second place, on May 20, 2006. On November 25, 2006, Cockburn won both the Individual gold medal and, with MacLennan, the synchronized gold medal at the Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup Final competition in Birmingham. In April 2007 at the Lake Placid Trampoline World Cup, the Cockburn and MacLennan achieved a new female synchronised trampoline routine world record for difficulty with a DD of 14.20. Karen Cockburn (far right) at the 2008 Summer Olympics with teammates Rosannagh MacLennan (left) and Jason Burnett (center) At the 2007 Canadian Trampoline Championships in Regina, Saskatchewan, Cockburn took first place, edging out MacLennan by 2.5 points with a score of 106.90 in the Women's Senior Individual trampoline category. In the category of synchronized trampoline, Cockburn and MacLennan won the gold with a score of 131.70. On November 3, 2007, at the 2007 Trampoline World Championships in Quebec City, Cockburn and MacLennan won the synchronised event, maintaining their unbroken string of nine first-place finishes in World Cup and World Championships. In the individual final, Cockburn did not complete her routine and finished in 8th place. However, her and MacLennan's rankings in the preliminary round earned two women's places at the 2008 Olympic Games for Canada. On June 7, 2008, Cockburn won her 10th Senior Women's Trampoline Canadian Championship in Calgary, beating MacLennan into second place. Both women, however, with Jason Burnett were named to compete for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Cockburn qualified for the finals in 4th place, and on August 18, 2008, she won a silver medal in the women's final at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.Women's Trampolining at the 2008 Olympics (Sport-Reference website) She was the only trampoline athlete to have won a medal at every Olympic Games at which the event has been competed until her 4th-place finish in the 2012 London Olympics. She was selected as Canada's flag bearer for the closing ceremonies of the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Following the 2008 Olympic Games, Cockburn did not compete again until the 2009 Canadian National Championships in Hamilton, Ontario. She came in second place after Rosannagh MacLennan. In the synchronised competition, she paired with MacLennan but they did not complete one routine and came in second place. She regained the Canadian National Championship in 2010 at Kamloops, British Columbia with MacLennan coming in 2nd place. In the 2009 Trampoline World Championships in St Petersburg, Russia, Cockburn won the Bronze medal in Individual trampoline in her first international competition since the Beijing Olympics. She also won a silver medal in Synchronised Trampoline with her usual partner Rosannagh Maclennan. In 2011, Cockburn did not compete in the Canadian National Championships and was sick for the Finals of the 2011 Pan American Games. In the 2011 Trampoline World Championships in Birmingham, England, Cockburn and MacLennan secured two places for Canadian women in the 2012 Summer Olympics and Cockburn won a Silver medal for the synchronised trampoline event (with MacLennan) and a Bronze medal for the Team competition.

He is an independent scholar and first published online all of Nathaniel Hawthorne's works, as well as scanning many works for Project Gutenberg and others. Eldred co-founded Creative Commons and served on its board of directors.  Biography  Eldred grew up in Florida, graduated from Harvard University in 1966 (philosophy, general studies), and then became a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. He was ordered to work for two years as alternative service, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he was a respiratory therapist and a chief pulmonary technologist until 1987. After he bought an Apple II computer in 1980, he was active in Apple users' groups and went to Harvard Extension School (programming and technical writing, C.A.S. 1991). Then he worked as an engineer at Apollo Computer (later Hewlett-Packard), and Cahners Publishing as a technical analyst and computer magazine journalist, then for Wang Government Services as a senior Unix systems administrator, before becoming disabled from repetitive strain injury. During 2004-05, he lived in an Internet Bookmobile traveling the U.S. visiting schools and libraries and special events to show readers how to print their own free books. Eldred is divorced, with three (triplet) daughters.  Eldritch Press  Eldritch Press is a website which republished the works of others in the public domain (no longer subject to copyright). For some years Eldritch Press ran on a Linux server from Eldred's home and is now hosted by Ibiblio and no longer maintained by him. Its principal feature was experimentation with HTML formats and the inclusion of graphics (while maintaining accessibility for blind readers) for online books that earlier had mostly been in ASCII format. Since the works, and Eldred's derivative works based on them, are in the public domain, anyone can make use of them, host them, and create more works of their own without payment or credit. In 2004, Eldred was denied a permit at Walden Pond State Reservation to print and give away free copies of Walden on the 150th anniversary of its publication. In 2005, Eldred returned with a permit, secured with the help of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, to print and give away copies of the book, and to demonstrate to readers how to self- publish and regain control of their own culture.  Eldred v.

It is unclear if it decreases coughing. Use is not recommended in children less than 6 years old. It is often used in combination with other medications. It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include dizziness, sleepiness, skin rash, and nausea. While it has not been properly studied in pregnancy, it appears to be safe. It is believed to work by making airway secretions more liquid. Guaifenesin has been used medically since at least 1933. It is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In the United States the wholesale cost is less than US$0.10 per dose. In 2017, it was the 234th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical use Guaifenesin is used to try to help with coughing up thick mucus and is sometimes combined with dextromethorphan, an antitussive (cough suppressant), such as in Mucinex DM or Robitussin DM. It is also combined with ephedrine to produce Primatene and Bronkaid tablets for symptomatic relief of asthma. Side effects Side-effects of guaifenesin include nausea, vomiting, formation of kidney stones, diarrhea, and constipation.Guaifenesin Side Effects https://www.drugs.com/sfx/guaifenesin-side-effects.html Nausea and vomiting can be reduced by taking guaifenesin with meals. The risk of forming kidney stones during prolonged use can be reduced by maintaining good hydration and increasing the pH of urine. Rarely, severe allergic reactions may occur, including a rash or swelling of the lips or gums, which may require urgent medical assistance. Mild dry mouth or chapped lips may also occur when taking this medication. Drinking a glass of water is recommended with each dose of guaifenesin.Guaifenesin https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682494.html Guaifenesin increases the analgesic effect of paracetamol (acetaminophen) Dolezal T, Krsiak M. Guaifenesin enhances the analgesic potency of paracetamol in mice. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2002;366(6):551-554. doi:10.1007/s00210-002-0642-y and aspirin, increases the sedative effects of alcohol, tranquilisers, sleep-pills and total anesthetics. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Guaifenesin is thought to act as an expectorant by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi. It has been said to aid in the flow of respiratory tract secretions, allowing ciliary movement to carry the loosened secretions upward toward the pharynx.Gutierrez, K. (2007). Pharmacotherapeutics: Clinical Reasoning in Primary Care. W.B. Saunders Co. Thus, it may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate removal of the secretions. Guaifenesin has muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties and may act as an NMDA receptor antagonist. History Similar medicines derived from the guaiac tree were in use as a generic remedy by American indigenous peoples when explorers reached North America in the 16th century. The Spanish encountered guaiacum wood \\"when they conquered Santo Domingo; it was soon brought back to Europe, where it acquired an immense reputation in the sixteenth century as a cure for syphilis and certain other diseases...\\" The 1955 edition of the Textbook of Pharmacognosy states: \\"Guaiacum has a local stimulant action which is sometimes useful in sore throat. The resin is used in chronic gout and rheumatism, whilst the wood is an ingredient in the compound concentrated solution of sarsaparilla, which was formerly much used as an alternative in syphilis.\\" In the US, Guaifenesin was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1952. Although previously deemed \\"Generally Regarded as Safe\\" in its original approval, the drug received a New Drug Application for the extended-release version, which won approval on July 12, 2002. Because of this, the FDA then issued letters to other manufacturers of timed-release guaifenesin to stop marketing their unapproved versions, leaving Adams Respiratory Therapeutics in control of the market. Adams was subsequently acquired by Reckitt Benckiser, based on the strength of the marketing generated by Adams' Mucinex brand. Availability Guaifenesin taken by mouth as pills or syrups. It is available under many brand names. Single-ingredient formulations of guaifenesin are available, and it is also included in many other over-the-counter cough and cold remedy combinations (usually in conjunction with dextromethorphan, paracetamol (acetaminophen), ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylephrine). Combination guaifenesin and pseudoephedrine is sold under the brand name Mucinex D, in which \\"D\\" refers to the presence of pseudoephedrine, a decongestant. Veterinary use Guaifenesin's neurological properties first became known in the late 1940s. Guaifenesin is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used routinely in large- animal veterinary surgery. Guaifenesin is used in combination with, for example, ketamine, since guaifenesin does not produce analgesia nor does it produce unconsciousness.Tranquilli, W. J., Thurmon, J. C., and Grimm, K. A. 2007. Lumb and Jones‚Äô Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia. Blackwell Publishing. Chapter: Centrally Acting Muscle Relaxants. Research The guaifenesin protocol was studied as a method to treat fibromyalgia; a one-year double-blind study found that the treatment performs no better than placebo. Guaifenesin is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Guaifenesin was studied as a method to improve the possibility of conception, by thinning and increasing the stretchability (improved spinnbarkeit) of the cervical mucus, during the few days before ovulation, thus facilitating sperm penetration.

Through most of its length it coincides with the Romania-Ukraine border that stretches along Danube. The canal is served by the Ukrainian state company Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority and its piloting services branch Delta Lotsman. Portion of the canal, Bystroe, stretched through territory of Ukraine rather along the main course raised big concern in Romania which emphasized ecological issues of it as it stretches through the Ukrainian Biosphere Reserve \\"Danube Delta\\". Description Originally the distributary (Bystroe) of Danube Delta was among the main Soviet (and Soviet Ukraine) waterways until 1959, when its exploitation stopped due to silting that occurred after Romanian authorities on a political initiative created own Danube ‚Äì Black Sea Canal away from the border with the Soviet Union.Bystroye Canal (Documentary research) After the Prorva distributary became silted in 1997, Ukraine was left without its own deep- water canal between the Danube and the Black Sea. According to the Ukrainian NGO International Centre for Policy Studies, the use of Romanian Sulina distributary costs Ukraine 0.7-1.2 million UAH annually. There was a project proposed by Ukraine to reopen its navigation. According to official Ukrainian plans, it was to be completed in 2008. The intent was to provide a deep-water route from the Danube to the Black Sea under Ukrainian control, in order to reduce ship transit costs and provide an alternate route to Romania. =Safety= Along the whole course of the Ukrainian deepwater shipping course there established modern systems of navigation and shipping safety. Navigational equipment of the sea shipping courses corresponds to the system of the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA), region A; and the Basic provisions on navigation along Danube. The shipping safety is provided by marine pilots and other piloting services of the Ukrainian state company Delta Lotsman. Navigational services are provided with modern specialized ships, GPS coastal stations, AIS coastal navigation as well as radar automated posts. All objects are integrated into one regional system of ship traffic management \\"Dunai\\" which provides not only ship traffic safety, but also greatly improves efficiency of ship traffic. The traffic participants are presented with operational meteorological and hydrological information, traffic status information, factors that might complicate shipping, etc. According to the Ministerial order #132 of 24 May 2005 for navigation and hydrographic provision of Danube shipping safety is responsible the state company \\"Derzhhidrohrafiya\\". The pilot project provides a traffic speed limit of ships along the sea access canal and Bystroe distributary 7 knots. At the other sites of shipping course the speed is regulated by local rules of shipping. It is recommended to limit the approach of vessels to sea access canal at wind speeds of over 15 meters per second and a wave height of 2 meters. Criticism Ecologists, including the World Wildlife Fund, have raised significant concerns about damage to the Danube Delta ecosystem. \\"Canalul Bastroe ‚Äì o posibila catastrofa ecologica?\\" (\\"The Bastroe Channel: a possible ecological catastrophe?\\"), originally posted June 29, 2004 on www.vinatorul.ro available as an archive, archived November 1, 2004 on the Internet Archive.The Bystroye Canal in the Ukrainian Danube Delta ‚Äì Questions and Answers (PDF) ‚Äì criticism by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 24 June 2004 An inquiry commission established under the auspices of the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (of which Romania and Ukraine are both signatories) unanimously decided that the canal would have a significant adverse ecological impact. In 2004 the European Commission issued a \\"Statement on Opening of Bystroye Canal in Ukraine\\" saying that \\"The European Commission deeply regrets the reported opening to navigation of the initial part of the Bystroye canal between the River Danube and the Black Sea. The canal route goes through a specially protected UNESCO World Heritage area in the Danube Delta which is also subject to the international Ramsar Convention on the protection of wetlands.\\"Commission Statement on Opening of Bystroye Canal in Ukraine, Brussels, 25 August 2004, IP/04/1043 The Ukrainian NGO International Centre for Policy Studies also protested the decision of the Ukrainian government, writing that \\"in its desire to get the canal as soon as possible, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine did not pay proper attention to considering all the alternatives, and approved an unjustified decision that violates Ukraine‚Äôs environmental interests and will heap greater expenditures upon the budget than those intended to be reduced by the building of the canal\\".Decision to build Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea canal turns a blind eye to other alternatives, ICPS newsletter #205, 27 October 2003 After the apparent failure of diplomatic efforts, the government of Romania, where most of the Danube Delta lies, is reportedly considering building a 20 km canal that would absorb the Danube's water upstream of Ukraine's small piece of the river, in order to render the planned Bastroye Channel useless and thereby discourage Ukraine from attempting such a project. The Romanian canal would be designed so that it could be shut at any time, returning the river more or less to its current state.Romania to Build Counter-Canal in Danube‚Äôs Delta The Danube Delta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991. The European Union has repeatedly asked Ukraine to halt the project, as have Romania and the United States. The Worldwide Fund for Nature has said the canal threatens the delta's most important wetland, where 70 percent of the world's white pelicans and 50 percent of pygmy cormorants live. The official inauguration of the project was scheduled for Ukrainian Independence Day August 24, 2004, but was postponed until August 26. On August 24, around 140 non-profit organisations and trade unions submitted an open letter at the Ukrainian embassy in Bucharest, Romania saying the project may endanger more than 280 bird species and 45 freshwater fish species living in the delta. \\"If Ukraine goes ahead with its plan ... the delta will become a fetid swamp,\\" said a statement by one of the unions. On August 26 Ukraine officially inaugurated the project and the Romanian government announced plans to bring a lawsuit against Ukraine at the Hague- based International Court of Justice, invoking the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. In May 2005, parties of the Aarhus Convention agreed on political sanctions against Ukraine. Ukraine announced the temporary halt of the project in June, 2005. In February 2006 \\"The Conference for the Sustainable Development of the Danube Delta\\" was held in Odessa with participation of Romania, Moldova and Ukraine and involved international organizations, work on the channel is still planned in accordance with international conventions.

Her music was characterized not only by her high, lonesome singing style, but also by her provocative pro- union, feminist songs. Cultural blogger John Pietaro noted that \\"Dickens didn‚Äôt just sing the anthems of labor, she lived them and her place on many a picket line, staring down gunfire and goon squads, embedded her into the cause.\\" The New York Times extolled her as \\"a clarion-voiced advocate for coal miners and working people and a pioneer among women in bluegrass music.\\" With Alice Gerrard, Dickens was one of the first women to record a bluegrass album. Hazel Dickens was known for her activism on behalf of non-unionized mineworkers Career Hazel Dickens was born in Montcalm, Mercer County, West Virginia on June 1, 1925, the eighth of eleven siblings in a mining family of 6 boys and 5 girls. Many of Hazels's relatives were miners, including her brothers, cousins, and, eventually, her brothers-in-law. In the early 1950s she moved to Baltimore. She met Mike Seeger, younger half-brother of Pete Seeger and founding member of the New Lost City Ramblers and became active in the Baltimore-Washington area bluegrass and folk music scene during the 1960s. During this time she also established a collaborative relationship with Mike Seeger's wife, Alice Gerrard, and as \\"Hazel & Alice\\" recorded two albums for the Folkways label: Who's That Knocking (And Other Bluegrass Country Music) (1965) and Won't You Come & Sing for Me (1973). Dickens and Gerrard were bluegrass bandleaders at a time when the vast majority of bluegrass bands were led by men. Together, they recorded two additional albums on Rounder Records, but Hazel & Alice broke up in 1976 and Dickens pursued a solo career where her music and songwriting became more political. Dickens used her music to try and make a difference in the lives of non-unionized mine workers and feminists. Dickens started to write more about the lives of miners and wrote a song titled \\"Black Lung\\" about her brother, Thurman, who died from the disease. She wrote a song titled \\"Coal Mining Women\\" about the hardships women faced in the coal mining world. In 1978, Dickens performed at the Vandalia Gathering in Charleston, West Virginia, both solo and then with the former coal-miner turned musician, Carl Rutherford. Dickens began to be seen as an activist and a voice for the working people. She appeared in the Oscar winning documentary Harlan County, USA, about the struggle of the county's miners union against scab workers, wage rights, and health conditions; sung about on the picket line in her folk songs as well as contributing those four songs to the soundtrack of the film. She also appeared in the films Matewan and Songcatcher. Dickens received the Merit Award from the International Bluegrass Music Association in 1994 and was the first woman to do so. In 2001 she was presented with a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Death In 2011 Dickens died in a Washington DC hospice from complications of pneumonia. After her death, it was reported in major media that she had been born on June 1, 1935, but her relatives and public records confirmed the earlier date of June 1, 1925.

It is a Linux software development environment based on Borland Delphi and Borland C++ Builder, which runs under Microsoft Windows. Continuing Delphi's classical Greek theme, Kylix is the name for an ancient Greek drinking cup. The closest supported equivalent to Kylix is the free Lazarus IDE package, designed to be code- compatible with Delphi. As of 2010 the project has been resurrected in the form of Delphi cross compiler for Mac and Linux, as shown in the Embarcadero's Delphi and C++ Builder roadmap. As of September 2011 with Kylix discontinued the framework for cross-platform development by Embarcadero is FireMonkey. Features Kylix supports application programming using Object Pascal and C++, and is particularly suited to the development of command line utilities and (especially) GUI applications, but not well suited to low-level programming, such as the development of device drivers or kernel modules. Though it interacts poorly with many Linux window managers, the IDE is basically the Delphi 5 IDE running on top of Wine, with a fast native code compiler, and tools for code navigation, auto-completion, parameter-name tooltips, and so on. The debugger is capable, but very slow to load, and can crash the whole IDE. Kylix features CLX, a Linux version of Borland's VCL [Visual Component Library], which is (mostly) a component-based control library, not unlike Visual Basic or .NET's WinForms. Like other component- oriented libraries, CLX contains both visual components (such as buttons and panels) and non-visual components (such as timers). The IDE makes it easy to select components and place them on a form, editing properties and event handlers with an \\"Object Inspector\\". Delphi's VCL is an object-oriented wrapper over raw Win32 controls, that maps Win32 messages and APIs to properties and events and is thus significantly easier to use than the raw API. As such, VCL is tightly bound to Windows, and Kylix's CLX is built on top of Trolltech's Qt library. CLX is not 100% compatible with VCL, and most Delphi programs require some effort to port to Kylix, even if they stick to the Borland libraries and avoid any direct OS calls. However, Qt is a portable library and, starting with Delphi 6, Borland provided CLX on Windows as well, providing a measure of back-portability. History On September 28, 1999, Inprise Corporation announced its development of a high performance Linux application development environment that will support C, C++, and Delphi development, code named \\"Kylix\\", with release date set for year 2000.Inprise Announces Commitment to Support C, C++ and Delphi Development on Linux ‚Äî Project Kylix to Deliver Rapid Application Development for Linux Operating System On March 24, 2000, Inprise/Borland Corporation hosted more than 200 third-party authors, consultants, trainers and tool and component vendors for the first in a series of worldwide events designed to prepare third party products and services for Kylix.Inprise/Borland'S Kylix Project Builds Strong Third Party Network for Linux ‚Äî First Event Attracts More Than 200 Authors, Consultants, Trainers and Tool and Component Vendors On March 7, 2001, Borland Software Corporation announced the release of Borland Kylix,Borland¬Æ Kylix‚Ñ¢ Now Available ‚Äî Borland Speeds Linux¬Æ Development Into The Mainstream With Kylix‚Ñ¢ after it had been offered to U.S. customers of Dell Precision 220, 420 and 620 Workstations beginning in February 2001.

Borland¬Æ Kylix‚Ñ¢3 Now Shipping - Borland¬Æ Kylix‚Ñ¢ 3 Delivers Rapid C++ Development to Linux¬Æ Developers Worldwide In 2005, Borland reportedly moved to discontinue Kylix development. Danny Thorpe seems to have been largely responsible for getting Borland to fund a Linux version of Delphi, and he did a lot of the work necessary to make the Delphi compiler produce Linux executables. While both Delphi and Kylix run on 32-bit Intel processors, Linux uses different register conventions than Windows and, of course, the executable and library file formats are different; see DLL, EXE, ELF for details. Legacy In 2009 Embarcadero posted the current Delphi and C++ Builder roadmap. As part of project Delphi \\"X\\" cross compilation for Mac and Linux was planned. Embarcadero is planning to release a new version of Kylix (without backward compatibility), but it will not hold a special name (Kylix). It will be a part of Delphi (and C++Builder) where one can code and compile in Delphi Windows IDE and deploy to Linux. C++Builder version will be also available. This roadmap item remained a couple versions on the roadmap as point for \\"future versions\\" but disappeared from roadmaps in the XE3-4 timeframe. Parts of project X went in production with XE2 and 3 though, but for mobile targets and OS X. In 8 Feb 2016, Embarcadero Technologies, Inc. announced an updated roadmap that indicates Linux server support in upcoming RAD Studio 10.2 (code name \\"Godzilla\\") development track, aka the Fall release. Linux desktop support was not mentioned.Embarcadero RAD Studio 2016 Product Approach and Roadmap On March 22, 2017, Embarcadero Technologies, Inc. announced the release of RAD Studio 10.2.RAD Studio 10.2 Opens Up Linux Deployment and Multi-tenancy Support for RAD Server See also *Borland Delphi *Free Pascal *Lazarus *Object Pascal *Embarcadero Technologies References External links * Borland Kylix Borland Software Corporation * Darren Kosinski.

Object-oriented Analysis and Design. Addison-Wesley, 1994. p71 or dynamic linkage‚Äîthough not an identical process to dynamically linking imported code libraries‚Äîis a computer programming mechanism in which the method being called upon an object, or the function being called with arguments, is looked up by name at runtime. In other words, a name is associated with a particular operation or object at runtime, rather than during compilation. With early binding, or static binding, in an object-oriented language, the compilation phase fixes all types of variables and expressions. This is usually stored in the compiled program as an offset in a virtual method table (\\"v-table\\"). In contrast, with late binding, the compiler does not read enough information to verify the method exists or bind its slot on the v-table. Instead, the method is looked up by name at runtime. The primary advantage of using late binding in Component Object Model (COM) programming is that it does not require the compiler to reference the libraries that contain the object at compile time. This makes the compilation process more resistant to version conflicts, in which the class's v-table may be accidentally modified. (This is not a concern in just- in-time compilation-compiled platforms such as .NET or Java, because the v-table is created at runtime by the virtual machine against the libraries as they are being loaded into the running application.) History The term \\"late binding\\" dates back to at least the 1960s, where it can be found in Communications of the ACM. The term was widely used to describe calling conventions in languages like Lisp, though usually with negative connotations about performance.Software engineering techniques, J. N. Buxton, Brian Randell, NATO Science Committee, NATO Science Committee, 1970 In the 1980s Smalltalk popularized object-oriented programming (OOP) and with it late binding. Alan Kay once said, \\"OOP to me means only messaging, local retention, and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them.\\" In the early to mid-1990s, Microsoft heavily promoted its COM standard as a binary interface between different OOP programming languages. COM programming equally promoted early and late binding, with many languages supporting both at the syntax level. In 2000, Alex Martelli coined the term \\"duck typing\\" to refer to a similar concept, but with a different emphasis. While late binding generally focuses on implementation details, duck typing focuses on the ability to ignore types and concentrate on the methods an object currently has. Late binding implementations =Late binding in dynamically-typed object-oriented languages= In most dynamically-typed languages, the list of methods on an object can be altered at runtime. This requires late binding. =Late binding in Lisp= In Lisp. late bound global function calls are efficiently looked up at runtime via a symbol's function cell. These function bindings are mutable. Example using an interactive Clozure Common Lisp session: ? (defun foo () (bar pi)) ; a still undefined function BAR gets called ;Compiler warnings : ; In FOO: Undefined function BAR FOO ? (defun bar (x) ; now we define it (* x 2)) BAR ? (foo) ; calling foo and it uses the recent definition of BAR 6.283185307179586D0 ? (defun bar (x) ; now we redefine BAR (* x 1000)) BAR ? (foo) ; FOO now calls the new function, there is no need to recompile/link/load FOO 3141.592653589793D0 ? (type-of 'bar) ; BAR is a symbol SYMBOL ? (symbol-function 'bar) ; the symbol BAR has a function binding # =Late binding in C++= In C++, late binding (also called \\"dynamic binding\\") refers to what normally happens when the \`virtual\` keyword is used in a method's declaration. C++ then creates a so-called virtual table, which is a look-up table for such functions that will always be consulted when they are called. Usually, the \\"late binding\\" term is used in favor of \\"dynamic dispatch\\". =Late binding in COM languages= In COM programming a late-bound method call is performed using the IDispatch interface. Some COM-based languages such as Visual Basic 6 have syntactical support for calling this interface. This is done by defining the variable's type as Object. Others such as C++ require that you explicitly call GetIDsOfNames to look up a method and Invoke to call it. =Late binding in .NET= In .NET, late binding refers to overriding a \`virtual\` method like C++ or implementing an interface. The compiler builds virtual tables for every virtual or interface method call which is used at run-time to determine the implementation to execute. Also like COM and Java, the Common Language Runtime provides reflection APIs that can make late binding calls. The use of these calls varies by language. With C# 4, the language also added the \\"dynamic\\" pseudo-type. This would be used in place of the Object type to indicate that late binding is desired. The specific late binding mechanism needed is determined at runtime using the Dynamic Language Runtime as a starting point. Visual Basic uses them whenever the variable is of type Object and the compiler directive \\"Option Strict Off\\" is in force. This is the default setting for a new VB project. Prior to version 9, only .NET and COM objects could be late bound. With VB 10, this has been extended to DLR-based objects. =Late binding in Java= There are three definitions for late binding in Java. Early documents on Java discussed how classes were not linked together at compile time. While types are statically checked at compile time, different implementations for classes could be swapped out just prior to runtime simply by overwriting the class file. As long as the new class definition had the same class and method names, the code would still work. In this sense it is similar to the traditional definition of late binding. Currently, it is popular to use the term late binding in Java programming as a synonym for dynamic dispatch. Specifically, this refers to Java's single dispatch mechanism used with virtual methods. Finally, Java can use late binding using its reflection APIs and type introspection much in the same way it is done in COM and .NET programming. Generally speaking those who only program in Java do not call this late binding. Likewise the use of \\"duck typing\\" techniques is frowned upon in Java programming, with abstract interfaces used instead. Oracle, the current owner of Java, has been known to use the term late binding in the \\"duck typing\\" sense when discussing both Java and other languages in the same documentation. =Early vs. late binding in PL/SQL and Ada= When using early binding between Ada and a database-stored procedure, a timestamp is checked to verify that the stored procedure has not changed since the code was compiled. This allows for faster executions and prevents the application from running against the wrong version of a stored procedure. When using late binding the timestamp check is not performed, and the stored procedure is executed via an anonymous PL/SQL block. While this can be slower, it removes the need to recompile all of the client applications when a stored procedure changes. This distinction appears to be unique to PL/SQL and Ada. Other languages that can call PL/SQL procedures, as well as other database engines, only use late binding. Criticism Late binding has poorer performance than an early bound method call. Under most implementations, the correct method address must be looked up by name with each call, requiring relatively expensive dictionary search and possibly overload resolution logic, yet it is generally negligible on modern computers. For some compilers, late binding may prevent the use of static type checking. When making a late bound call, the compiler has to assume that the method exists. This means a simple spelling error can cause a run-time error to be thrown. The exact exception varies by language, but it is usually named something like \\"Method Not Found\\" or \\"Method Missing\\". Modern compilers avoid this by ensuring that every possible call must have an implementation during compilation. Late binding may prevent forms of static analysis needed by an integrated development environment (IDE). For example, an IDE's \\"go to definition\\" feature may not function on a late-bound call, if the IDE has no way to know which class the call may refer to. A modern IDE easily solves this especially for object-oriented languages since a late-bound method always specifies an interface or base class, which is where \\"go to definition\\" leads, and \\"find all references\\" can be used to find all implementations or overrides. A similar problem is that possible lack of typing information may prevent the creation of dependency graphs. However, other programming methods such as abstract interfaces can result in the same problems. A modern IDE can create such dependency graphs as easily as it handles \\"find all references\\".

Career At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Psarra entered the women's competition as Greece's best hope for a medal having finished eighteenth overall at the 2003 World Archery Championships. She placed 8th in the women's individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 652. In the first round of elimination, she faced 57th-ranked Jo-Ann Galbraith of Australia. Psarra defeated Galbraith 138-116 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 25th-ranked Turkish archer Zekiye Keskin Satir, defeating her 163-161. Psarra then defeated 24th-ranked Almudena Gallardo of Spain 160-152, advancing to the quarterfinals, where she faced Park Sung-hyun of Korea. A poor shot with her first arrow however led to defeat against the South Korean, though Psarra said she did not feel disappointed with the result. The final score of 111-101 in the 12 arrow match placed Psarra 7th overall in women's individual archery. Psarra was also a member of the 5th-place Greek team in the women's team archery competition. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Psarra finished her ranking round with a total of 613 points. This gave her the 50th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Chen Ling in the first round. The local Chinese favourite archer won the confrontation with 110-101 and eliminated Psarra straight away. Psarra lost to Bombayla Devi Laishram of India in the first knockout round at the 2012 Summer Olympics. =2016: Fifth Olympics= Psarra narrowly missed qualifying for the 2016 Summer Olympics at the Final Qualification Tournament in Antalya in June 2016, which allocated the remaining six positions available for the women's individual event. She and Spain's Adriana Mart√≠n both suffered defeats at the tournament's quarter-final stage, but because Mart√≠n's total match score of 128 points exceeded Psarra's own score of 126, the Spaniard claimed the final qualification position on countback. The withdrawal of an archer from C√¥te d'Ivoire in July however led to a vacant position, which was assigned to Greece as the highest ranked nation without an Olympic berth. The Greek National Olympic Committee subsequently nominated the 42-year-old Psarra for her fifth Olympic Games. Psarra entered Rio de Janeiro as the most experienced Olympian in the field, finishing the ranking round in fifty-fifth place. She was eliminated in the first round for her third Olympic Games in a row, losing to Japan's Kaori Kawanaka by seven set points to three. Following the Olympics, Psarra was one of four archers to donate apparel and equipment used in Rio de Janeiro to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.

NgƒÅti Porou is affiliated with the 28th Maori Battalion and has the second-largest affiliation of any iwi in New Zealand, with 71,910 registered members in 2006. The traditional rohe or tribal area of NgƒÅti Porou extends from P≈çtikirua and Lottin Point in the north to Te Toka-a-Taiau (a rock that used to sit in the mouth of Gisborne harbour) in the south. Mt Hikurangi features prominently in NgƒÅti Porou traditions as a symbol of endurance and strength, and holds tapu status. In these traditions, Hikurangi is often personified. NgƒÅti Porou traditions indicate that Hikurangi was the first point to surface when MƒÅui fished up the North Island from beneath the ocean. His canoe, the Nuku-tai-memeha, is said to have been wrecked there. The Waiapu River also features in NgƒÅti Porou traditions. History NgƒÅti Porou paepae pƒÅtaka (threshold of a storehouse) in the Waiapu Valley =Pre-European history= NgƒÅti Porou takes its name from the ancestor Porourangi, also known as Porou Ariki. He was a direct descendant of Toi-kai-rƒÅkau. Other ancestors include MƒÅui, accredited in oral tradition with raising the North Island from the sea, and Paikea, the whale rider. Although NgƒÅti Porou claim the Nukutaimemeha as their foundation canoe, many NgƒÅti Porou ancestors arrived on different canoes, including Horouta, TƒÅkitimu and Tereanini. The descendants of Porourangi and Toi formed groups that spread across the East Cape through conquest and through strategic marriage alliances. Associations with other iwi also arise through direct descent from NgƒÅti Porou ancestors: * Kahungunu, descending from Ueroa, second son of Porourangi, is the founding ancestor of NgƒÅti Kahungunu, who occupy the region south of the NgƒÅti Porou tribal boundaries. * Taua, descended from Kahungunu, is a prominent ancestor in Te WhƒÅnau-ƒÅ-Apanui genealogy. * NgƒÅti Raukawa and the Tainui iwi have association through Rongomaianiwaniwa, daughter of Porourangi, and the marriage of the ancestress MƒÅhinaarangi to T≈´rongo. * NgƒÅi Tahu traditions also indicate descent from both Porourangi and from Tahup≈çtiki, younger-brother to the former. =Colonial history= Wharenui (meeting house) in Waiomatatini, 1896, named Porourangi after the ancestor NgƒÅti Porou derive their name from. The early 19th century saw NgƒÅti Porou in conflict with NgƒÅ Puhi during the latter's campaign of warfare throughout the North Island. This period also saw the introduction of Christianity to the region, which led to a period of relative calm and cultural development. NgƒÅti Porou chiefs were also signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. NgƒÅti Porou experienced substantial economic growth during the 1850s. During the 1860s, the Pai MƒÅrire religious movement spread through the North Island, and eventually came into conflict with the New Zealand Government. From 1865‚Äì1870, a civil war emerged within NgƒÅti Porou, between Pai MƒÅrire converts seeking the creation of an independent MƒÅori state (supported by Pai MƒÅrire from other regions) and other NgƒÅti Porou advocating tribal sovereignty and independence. This conflict is generally viewed as part of the East Cape War. =Modern history= NgƒÅti Porou once again enjoyed peace and economic prosperity during the late 19th century. The 1890s saw the emergence of Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata, who contributed greatly to the revitalisation of the MƒÅori people. During the early 20th century, the population of NgƒÅti Porou increased substantially. They were active in their participation in both World Wars. After World War II, large numbers of NgƒÅti Porou began emigrating from traditional tribal lands and moving into larger urban areas, in a trend reflected throughout New Zealand. A large portion of the tribal population now lives in Auckland and Wellington.

It is traditionally a breakfast dish, served with coffee or cafe au lait, and has a mention in most Creole cuisine cookbooks. Calas are also referred to as Creole rice fritters or rice doughnuts. Plate of calas at a New Orleans restaurant History The origin of calas is most often credited to slaves who came from rice-growing regions of Africa. A 1653 French recipe, beignets de riz, lends support to a French origin as well. The name \\"calas\\" is said to have come from the Nupe word kara (\\"fried cake\\"). According to The Dictionary of American Food & Drink, the word calas was first printed in 1880. Creole street vendors, typically women, sold the fresh hot calas in the city's French Quarter, with the cry, \\"Bel calas tout chauds!\\" (Creole for \\"Beautiful calas, still hot\\"). These vendors, called \\"calas women\\", would sell their pastries in the early morning from covered baskets or bowls carried upon their heads. Writers in the first decade of the 20th century refer to the increasing rarity of calas as street food. Though not widely sold, calas continued to be made at home using leftover rice, and was a typical breakfast food in early 20th-century New Orleans. After World War II, while the beignet remained popular, the calas became more and more obscure. From a breakfast food it evolved into a Mardi Gras and First Communion treat among Louisiana Creole families. It could be specially requested at some restaurants. Through the efforts of food preservationists, interest in calas was revived and it began to appear on the menus of some restaurants. Preparation In early recipes for calas, rice was boiled and cooled, then yeast added to make a sponge that was allowed to proof overnight. From this a batter was made by adding eggs, sugar and a little flour for binding. Rice flour was preferable but difficult to obtain, according to Eustis. A dash of salt might be included, and a grating of nutmeg was a typical addition. The batter was dropped by spoonfuls into deep, boiling lard and fried until browned. Modern recipes reflect the changes in available ingredients, cooking practices, and taste. Baking powder is sometimes used in place of yeast; vegetable oil is substituted for lard; savory variations have been developed.

The most frequently used feature is software deployment, which provides installation and updating of Windows Apps, legacy applications and Operating Systems across a business enterprise. SMS 2003 saw the introduction of the Advanced Client. The Advanced Client communicates with a more scalable management infrastructure, namely the Management Point. (A Management Point (MP) can manage up to 25000 Advanced Clients.) Microsoft introduced the Advanced Client to provide a solution to the problem where a managed laptop might connect to a corporate network from multiple locations and thus should not always download content from the same place within the enterprise (though it should always receive policy from its own site). When an Advanced Client is within another location (SMS Site), it may use a local distribution point to download or run a program, which can conserve bandwidth across a WAN.

The film, a romantic melodrama set in Kentucky, is about a widower (Bernhard Goetzke) who jealously competes with his crippled son (John F. Hamilton) and a man he loathes (Malcolm Keen) over the affections of a schoolteacher (Nita Naldi). The film was mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich, Germany in autumn of 1925, with exterior scenes shot in the village of Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol, Austria. Production was plagued with problems, including the destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and he was influenced by German cinematic style and technique. The film was released in Germany in May 1926 and screened for its British distributors in October 1926. It was met with disapproval and it was not until after the success of Hitchcock's The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog that the film was released in the UK in May 1927. The film received mixed reviews and Hitchcock himself told Fran√ßois Truffaut he was relieved that the film was lost. Six surviving stills of The Mountain Eagle are reproduced in Truffaut's book, and further stills have been found. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described it as \\"the most wanted film in the world\\", and the British Film Institute has the film on the top of their BFI 75 Most Wanted list of missing films and is actively searching for it. Plot The film is set in Kentucky, where J. P. Pettigrew's (Bernhard Goetzke) wife had died giving birth to their son Edward (John F. Hamilton), born disabled. Pettigrew loathes John 'Fear o' God' Fulton (Malcolm Keen) who was also in love with Pettigrew's wife. Pettigrew later witnesses his now-grown son making love to schoolteacher Beatrice (Nita Naldi), and confronts her about the relationship. He attempts to take her in his arms, but Beatrice rejects his advances. Pettigrew's son Edward sees this and flees the village. Pettigrew is incensed at both Beatrice's rejection and the loss of his son, and thus attempts to have Beatrice arrested as a wanton harlot. John forestalls Pettigrew's plan by marrying Beatrice and taking her to his cabin where they fall in love. Beatrice becomes pregnant. Pettigrew seeks revenge by having John thrown in prison for murdering his (missing) son. A year later, John breaks out of prison and attempts to flee with Beatrice and their child. However, Beatrice falls ill and John must return to the village for a doctor. There he finds that Edward has reappeared. John's affairs are now cleared up and he is legally free from the charge of murder. Pettigrew is subsequently shot and wounded (contemporary sources differ on this point), and is no longer a threat to John and his family. Cast Nita Naldi, the female love interest of the film. * Nita Naldi as Beatrice * Malcolm Keen as John 'Fear o' God' Fulton * John F. Hamilton as Edward Pettigrew * Bernhard Goetzke as J.P. Pettigrew * Ferdinand Martini Preservation status The Mountain Eagle is the only feature film directed by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in Fran√ßois Truffaut's book. More stills have since been located, many of which are reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in the archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (¬£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl by train, horse and cart, and by foot. Production The village of Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol, where the exterior footage of the film was shot Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were produced in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich in the fall of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of S√∂lden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the √ñtztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works. Production was plagued with problems. Poor weather during the location shoot was a constant source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents. Reception The film was initially screened for its British distributors in October 1926, but they did not think much of the film and decided to shelve it. However, due to the runaway success of The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, which was released in February 1927, the producers decided to release The Mountain Eagle three months later on 23 May 1927. Writing in 1949, the academic Peter Noble inadvertently started a rumour repeated by many authors since, of the film being released in the United States as Fear o' God. Noble's assertion is contradicted by the title on the surviving US lobby card and film historian J. Larry Kuhns, who claims the film was never released under that title. The film, distributed by Gainsborough Pictures, was neither a critical nor commercial success; Leonard J. Leff states that the film \\"impressed neither the distributor nor the public\\". Like Hitchcock's other early films, the film was criticised for a lack of realism; an early review by Bioscope stated that \\"in spite of skilful and at times brilliant direction, the story has an air of unreality.\\" Hitchcock himself considered The Mountain Eagle to be mundane melodrama best forgotten, and described the film to Fran√ßois Truffaut as \\"awful\\" and a \\"very bad movie\\", and stated that he was not sorry that there are no known prints. After being bitterly disappointed with his first two films, Hitchcock believed that his directing career would soon be over, although he later described Waltzes from Vienna (1934) to be the \\"lowest ebb\\" of his career. Film historian J. Lary Kuhns, however, states in the book Hitchcock's Notebooks by Dan Auiler that one contemporary writer called The Mountain Eagle far superior to The Lodger. The Guardian describes the film as \\"a ripping yarn about a dastardly father, a crippled son, a lovely schoolteacher and an innocent imprisoned\\". William Rothman considers both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle to be \\"equally worthy of study\\". The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described The Mountain Eagle as \\"the most wanted film in the world\\". In 1992, the British Film Institute released its first \\"Missing Presumed Lost\\" list of films, and in January 2010 they announced that they had begun actively searching for some 75 missing films, including The Mountain Eagle; A Study in Scarlet (1914), which features the first screen appearance of the Sherlock Holmes character; The First Men in the Moon (1919), which is the first H. G. Wells-adapted science-fiction; and Dinah Shurey's The Last Post (1929).

Remembrance Day parade in front of Major-General George R. Pearkes Building The Major-General George R. Pearkes Building (often abbreviated as just Pearkes and referred to as '101 Col By') is the principal location of Canada's National Defence Headquarters (NDHQ) and is located in downtown Ottawa, Ontario. NDHQ actually comprises a collection of offices spread across the National Capital Region, however it is most commonly identified with the Major-General George R. Pearkes Building at 101 Colonel By Drive in Ottawa. Design controversy The Major-General George R. Pearkes Building, viewed from Colonel By Drive, formerly the coach yard for Ottawa Union Station. The building, named after Major-General G.R. Pearkes, was constructed between 1969 and 1974, and was originally intended for use by the Department of Transport. When a planned National Defence Headquarters complex on the LeBreton Flats was not built, however, DND acquired the Colonel By Drive structure. In 1972, the Department of Transportation moved into Place de Ville's newly completed Tower C. The concept for the group of buildings was developed by French town planner Jacques Gr√©ber immediately after World War II at the invitation of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Gr√©ber, a proponent of boulevards and highways as opposed to rail corridors, advised that the city redevelop the east bank of the Rideau Canal which was, at that time, covered with railway tracks leading to Ottawa Union Station. This design was accomplished with the removal of the station tracks and relocation of passenger rail service to a new suburban station; the Ottawa Union Station building has since become the Government Conference Centre. The remaining land that contained the coach yard for Ottawa Union Station was vacant and ready for developments that would contain the Pearkes Building and the Rideau Centre. Architects John C. Parkin, Searle, Wilby, and Rowland designed the buildings in the then-popular Brutalist style. They were conceived as the first phase of the planned redevelopment, the Rideau Centre, which opened in 1983, being the second phase. Attack vulnerability During the Cold War, the threat of nuclear attack on the National Capital Region saw a Central Emergency Government Headquarters constructed 30 km west of Ottawa at CFS Carp; this facility was to house a scaled-down NDHQ, along with the federal cabinet and other political, military and government leaders. The threat of terrorist attacks in recent decades, particularly following the September 11, 2001 attacks, led to the permanent closure of an access road that runs beneath the connecting section of the two structures comprising the MGen George R. Pearkes Building. The interior mezzanine corridor connecting the north and south towers has been closed to all but pass holders since the 1990s. A dramatic architectural feature (and potential vulnerability), it was initially cordoned off using temporary concrete barriers. Work has now been completed permanently closing off the thoroughfare that formerly linked Nicholas Street to Colonel By Drive and the adjacent Rideau Canal by building permanent concrete barriers, metal fencing, and a gatehouse equipped with the capability to stop unauthorised vehicles from entering. Possible relocation The MGen George R. Pearkes Building underwent extensive renovations from the mid-1990s as each floor was gutted to replace the hodge podge of outdated offices and furnishings dating to the building's opening in 1974. Modular office furnishings produced by CORCAN (constructed in Canadian prisons) were installed. By the mid-2000s it became apparent that the NDHQ complex at the MGen George R. Pearkes Building was overcrowded, forcing DND to spread some headquarters staff across the National Capital Region. Sizeable NDHQ offices have been established in the past, or are still currently located in, Place Export Canada, the Constitution Building, l'Esplanade Laurier, Louis St Laurent Building (Gatineau, QC) and the Berger Building, among others. Recent cutbacks among high-technology companies in the Ottawa region led DND to consider buying a surplus JDS Uniphase campus in suburban Barrhaven at the intersection of Merivale Road and Prince of Wales Drive, west of the Ottawa International Airport. JDS's former Barrhaven campus comprises two large buildings with extensive computer networking capacity, and is currently selling for a fraction of its construction cost. The location was perceived to be far more secure, being set back from public roads, and has ample parking and transit connections for the several thousand employees it was designed to support. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police now occupy this property. Carling Campus Relocation (Pentagon North) DND is in the process of relocating some of their to the former Nortel R&D; facility at Carling Campus in 2017.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/dnd-nortel-campus- january-2017-photos-1.3899871 References External links Category:Federal government buildings in Ottawa Category:Military of Canada Category:Brutalist architecture in Canada ","title":"Major-General George R Pearkes Building"},{"id":"916552","text":"Three types of corkscrew: two modern (left and bottom) and one old (right) A basic corkscrew A corkscrew is a tool for drawing corks from wine bottles and other household bottles that may be sealed with corks. In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic helix (often called the \\"worm\\") attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when inserted fully into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of levers that further increase the amount of force that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making easier the extraction of difficult corks. History Its design may have derived from the gun worm which was a device used by men to remove unspent charges from a musket's barrel in a similar fashion, from at least the early 1630s.winepros.com.au. The corkscrew is possibly an English invention, due to the tradition of beer and cider, and Treatise on Cider by John Worlidge in 1676 describes \\"binning of tightly corked cider bottles on their sides\\", although the earliest reference to a corkscrew is, \\"steel worm used for the drawing of Corks out of Bottles\\" from 1681. In 1795, the first corkscrew patent was granted to the Reverend Samuell Henshall, in England. The clergyman affixed a simple disk, now known as the Henshall Button, between the worm and the shank. The disk prevents the worm from going too deep into the cork, forces the cork to turn with the turning of the crosspiece, and thus breaks the adhesion between the cork and the neck of the bottle. The disk is designed and manufactured slightly concave on the underside, which compresses the top of the cork and helps keep it from breaking apart. A person who collects corkscrews is a helixophile.Quarterly Worme (2000 to present), newsletter of the Canadian Corkscrew Collectors Club, p. 2CorkscrewNet Types =Basic= In its traditional form, a corkscrew is simply a steel screw attached to a perpendicular handle, made of wood or some other material. The user grips the handle and screws the metal point into the cork, until the helix is firmly embedded, then a vertical pull on the corkscrew extracts the cork from the bottle. The handle of the corkscrew allows for a commanding grip to ease removal of the cork. = Winged corkscrew = A wing corkscrew with a rack and pinion mechanism In 1880, William Burton Baker was issued British Patent No. 2950 for his double lever corkscrew, with both levers articulated onto the upper end of the shank. The first American patent was in 1930 granted to the Italian Domenick Rosati who emigrated to Chicago, Illinois, to work as bartender before the prohibition. Such design was adapted by other brands as the wine-market grew in popularity.\\"Corkscrew Put Leverage on Stubborn Stoppers.\\" Popular Science, May 1939, p. 71. The winged owl version, with a rack and pinion mechanism, was first designed and manufactured in 1932 by the Spanish industrial designer David Ola√±eta for his brand BOJ (and later adapted by other brands).\\"Corkscrew Put Leverage on Stubborn Stoppers.\\" Popular Science, May 1939, p. 71. The wing corkscrew, sometimes called cork-extactor, a butterfly corkscrew, owl corkscrew or angel corkscrew, has two levers, one on either side of the worm. As the worm is twisted into the cork, the levers are raised. Pushing down the levers draws the cork from the bottle in one smooth motion. The most common design has a rack and pinion connecting the levers to the body. The head of the central shaft is frequently modified to form a bottle opener, increasing the utility of the device. Corkscrews of this design are particularly popular in household use. = Sommelier knife = A sommelier knife A sommelier knife, waiter's friend or wine key is a corkscrew in a folding body similar to a pocket knife. It was conceived by the German Karl Wienke in 1882 and patented in Germany, England, and America. An arm extends to brace against the lip of the bottle for leverage when removing the cork. Some sommelier knives have two steps on the lever, and often also a bottle opener. A small hinged knife blade is housed in the handle end to be used in cutting the foil wrapping the neck of many wine bottles. A corkscrew of this type can be used more quickly (and with more \\"show\\" or panache) than a wing-type corkscrew. The term \\"wine key\\" came into existence due to the German inventor's last name, Wienke, which is difficult for English speakers to pronounce. When ordering the product from catalogs, the meaning and origins of the new Wienke Corkscrew gradually became lost and it was simply referred to as a \\"Winekey\\" or wine key. Patent number 283,731, August 21, 1883, simply refers to it as \\"C.F.A. WIENKE LEVER CORKSCREW.\\" = Twin-prong cork puller = A twin prong cork puller Also known as butler's friend or \\"Ah-So\\" (from the German ach so!, meaning now I understand!), the twin-prong cork puller can extract a stopper without damaging it, to allow for sampling the wine before re-inserting the stopper. The stopper is removed by pushing the prongs between the cork and the neck of the bottle, and twisting the stopper out of the bottle. Replacing the stopper involves taking it between the two prongs, then twisting it into the bottle and pulling out the prongs. It can also extract a stopper in bad condition. = Lever corkscrew = A lever corkscrew The lever or \\"rabbit\\" corkscrew is operated using a pair of handles which are used to grip the neck of the bottle, and a lever which is simply pressed down to twist the screw into the cork, then lifted to extract the cork. Expelling the cork from the device is done with a similar press/lift action. This style of corkscrew is much bulkier, and typically much more expensive, than other styles, but is much faster. A table-mounted corkscrew =Mounted corkscrew= These were invented in the late 1800s for use in homes, hotel bars and restaurants in an era where all bottles were stopped with corks. They are screwed or clamped to counters or walls. When beer began to be sold in bottles, bars required a speedy way to open them. Most early mounted corkscrew were designed to open beer bottles with short corks. Modern ones are made for longer wine corks.Meadows, Wayne. Compendium of Bar Corkscrews, Vancouver, 2001 =Screwpull= In 1979, Herbert Allen introduced the \\"Screwpull\\" corkscrew. The device was meant to make opening wine bottles fool-proof. The Screwpull wraps around the top of the bottle, with a plastic screw that simply needs to be turn to remove the cork, without effort. The spiral is coated with Teflon, which reduces friction as it twists into the cork, ensuring it is removed intact without pulling.https://www.chron.com/local/history/innovators- inventions/article/Born-of-personal-necessity-devices-do-Houston-8333237.php The Screwpull is part of The Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs permanent collection. https://www.moma.org/collection/works/1280 A Screwpull type corkscrew The company was sold to Le Creuset in 1992. =Others= There are many other styles of corkscrew which are not widely used in consumer settings, such as high-priced elaborate devices for specialists, and for industrial uses.

For the newly reorganized investment banking division of Credit Suisse, see here Credit Suisse First Boston (informally CSFB) was the investment banking division of Credit Suisse Group, prior to 2006. It was active in investment banking, capital markets and financial services. In 2006, as part of a major rebranding exercise to communicate as an integrated organization - 'Credit Suisse' to clients, employees and shareholders; the group retired the 'First Boston' name and amalgamated the CSFB operations to the newly reorganized investment banking division of Credit Suisse. History =Credit Suisse/First Boston 50/50 JV (1978‚Äì1988)= In 1978, Credit Suisse and First Boston Corporation formed a London-based 50-50 investment banking joint venture called the Financi√®re Cr√©dit Suisse-First Boston. This joint venture later became the operating name of Credit Suisse's investment banking operations. = Transition to CSFB (1988‚Äì1997)= Credit Suisse acquired a 44% stake in First Boston in 1988. The investment bank acquired its shares held by the public and the company was taken private. In 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress Company, maker of Sealy mattresses, a deal that became known as \\"the burning bed\\". The amount lent, $457 million, was 40 percent of First Boston‚Äôs equity capital. Credit Suisse bailed them out and acquired a controlling stake in 1990. Although such an arrangement was arguably illegal under the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. bank regulator, concluded that the integrity of the financial markets was better served by avoiding the bankruptcy of a significant investment bank like First Boston even though it meant a de facto merger of a commercial bank with an investment bank. = CSFB (1997‚Äì2006)= In the mid-1990s, Credit Suisse renamed itself CS First Boston as Credit Suisse First Boston, or CSFB, worldwide. The terms Credit Suisse First Boston and CSFB are generally used to refer to the global investment bank, and not only the original London franchise. Conflict with Credit Suisse First Boston, or CSFB, in Europe began creating problems for Credit Suisse. First Boston Corporation in New York and CSFB in London had their own management teams, with competing salesmen in each other's territory and in the Pacific region. In 1996, Credit Suisse purchased the remaining stake of CS First Boston from its management and rebranded the European, U.S., and Asia Pacific investment banks as Credit Suisse First Boston, making one global brand. In the late 1990s, CSFB purchased the equity division of Barclays Bank, Barclays de Zoete Wedd (\\"BZW\\"). BZW was valued for its London presence and CSFB outbid DLJ, which it subsequently acquired too, to buy BZW from Barclays. At the same time, the newly global CSFB became a leading high tech banker, acting as lead (or co-lead) underwriter in the IPOs of Amazon.com and Cisco Systems, as well as one time high fliers such as Silicon Graphics, Intuit, Netscape and VA Linux Systems. CSFB also did significant deals for Apple Computer, Compaq and Sun Microsystems among others. In 2000, at the height of the tech boom, technology deals generated $1.4 billion in revenue for CSFB. The head of CSFB's tech group, Frank Quattrone, reportedly made $200 million in bonuses between 1998 and 2000.‚ÄúInside Frank Quattrone's Money Machine: The rise and fall of the high-tech investment banker who was an architect of Silicon Valley's financial culture,‚Äù Business Week October 2003.

A tide pool in Porto Covo, west coast of Portugal Tide pools or rock pools are shallow pools of seawater that form on the rocky intertidal shore. Many of these pools exist as separate bodies of water only at low tide. Many tide pools are habitats of especially adaptable animals that have engaged the attention of naturalists and marine biologists, as well as philosophical essayists: John Steinbeck wrote in The Log from the Sea of Cortez, \\"It is advisable to look from the tide pool to the stars and then back to the tide pool.\\" Zones from shallow to deep Tide pools in Santa Cruz, California from spray/splash zone to low tide zone Tide pools exist in the \\"intertidal zone\\" (the area within the tidal range), which is submerged by the sea at high tides and during storms, and may receive spray from wave action. At other times the rocks may undergo other extreme conditions, baking in the sun or exposed to cold winds. Few organisms can survive such harsh conditions. Lichens and barnacles live in this zone. Different barnacle species live at very tightly constrained elevations, with tidal conditions precisely determining the exact height of an assemblage relative to sea level. The intertidal zone is periodically exposed to sun and wind, conditions that can cause barnacles to become desiccated. These animals therefore need to be well adapted to water loss. Their calcite shells are impermeable, and they possess two plates which they slide across their mouth opening when not feeding. These plates also protect against predation. =High tide zone= The high tide zone is flooded during each high tide. Organisms must survive wave action, currents, and exposure to the sun. This zone is predominantly inhabited by seaweed and invertebrates, such as sea anemones, starfish, chitons, crabs, green algae, and mussels. Marine algae provide shelter for nudibranches and hermit crabs. The same waves and currents that make life in the high tide zone difficult bring food to filter feeders and other intertidal organisms. Low tide zone in a tide pool =Low tide zone= Also called the \\"lower littoral zone\\", this area is mostly submerged and is exposed only during unusually low tide. It often teems with life and has far more marine vegetation, especially seaweeds. There is also greater biodiversity. Organisms in this zone do not have to be as well adapted to drying out and temperature extremes. Low tide zone organisms include abalone, anemones, brown seaweed, chitons, crabs, green algae, hydroids, isopods, limpets, mussels, and sometimes even small vertebrates such as fish. These creatures can grow to larger sizes because there is more available energy and better water coverage: the water is shallow enough to allow additional sunlight for photosynthetic activity, with almost normal levels of salinity. This area is also relatively protected from large predators because of the wave action and shallow water. Marine life Tide pools provide a home for hardy organisms such as starfish, mussels and clams. Inhabitants must be able to deal with a frequently changing environment: fluctuations in water temperature, salinity, and oxygen content. Hazards include waves, strong currents, exposure to midday sun and predators. Waves can dislodge mussels and draw them out to sea. Gulls pick up and drop sea urchins to break them open. Starfish prey on mussels and are eaten by gulls themselves. Black bears are known to sometimes feast on intertidal creatures at low tide. Although tide pool organisms must avoid getting washed away into the ocean, drying up in the sun, or being eaten, they depend on the tide pool's constant changes for food. =Fauna= The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima reproduces clones of itself through a process of longitudinal fission, in which the animal splits into two parts along its length. The sea anemone Anthopleura sola often engages in territorial fights. The white tentacles (acrorhagi), which contain stinging cells, are for fighting. The sea anemones sting each other repeatedly until one of them moves. Some species of starfish can regenerate lost arms. Most species must retain an intact central part of the body to be able to regenerate, but a few can regrow from a single ray. The regeneration of these stars is possible because the vital organs are in the arms. =Flora= Sea palms (Postelsia) look similar to miniature palm trees. They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in areas with greater wave action. High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus, allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize. In addition, the constant wave action removes competitors, such as the mussel species Mytilus californianus. Recent studies have shown that Postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists; a control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes. Alternatively, the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as Corallina or Halosaccion, allowing Postelsia to grow freely after wave action has eliminated the mussels.

It is headquartered in Paris, France. The mission of EUTELSAT IGO is to maintain the rights to use radio frequencies and orbital locations which were assigned collectively to the Member States by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and to oversee the operations of Eutelsat S.A. so as to ensure that the company complies with the international EUTELSAT Convention.EUTELSAT Amended Convention EUTELSAT IGO plays an active role within the global telecommunications community and is a key actor in the satellite business sector.  History  The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization was created in 1977 on an interim basis by 17 European countries, members of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). Its purpose was to provide Europe with a satellite infrastructure for a wide range of telecommunications services. The Convention establishing the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization EUTELSAT was opened for signature in July 1982 and entered into force on 1 September 1985.The Convention establishing the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization EUTELSAT The main mission of EUTELSAT was the design, development, construction, operation and maintenance of the space segment for international public telecommunications services in Europe. EUTELSAT started by providing space segment capacity for basic telecommunications and audio-visual services and rapidly expanded its activities to the provision of services for analogue and digital television, radio broadcasting, business telecommunications, multimedia communications, messaging and positioning in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the American continent. Following the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in Europe, the EUTELSAT Member States decided in May 1999 to restructure the organisation. On 2 July 2001 all assets, liabilities and operational activities of the intergovernmental organisation were transferred to Eutelsat S.A., a private company established in Paris for this purpose. The original EUTELSAT Convention was amended with the agreement of the Member States and the amendments entered into force on a definitive basis in November 2002. There is an agreement between EUTELSAT IGO and Eutelsat S.A. for the use of the name EUTELSAT. When written in capital letters and followed by IGO it refers to the international organisation while the companies of the Eutelsat Group write Eutelsat in small letters in order to avoid potential confusion.  Purposes  Since its restructuring in 2001, the structure, role, mission and activities of EUTELSAT IGO have evolved to reflect developments in the fields of regulation, technology and markets for Fixed Satellite Services. The primary purpose of EUTELSAT IGO is to ensure that Eutelsat S.A. observes the Basic Principles set forth in Article III a) of the Amended Convention referring to public service/universal service obligations, pan European coverage by the satellite system, non-discrimination and fair competition. This supervisory task is executed primarily through the participation of the Executive Secretary on the boards of directors of Eutelsat S.A. and its parent company Eutelsat Communications (Paris Stock Exchange symbol: ETL) as an observer (censeur). This gives him the right to obtain information and voice opinions without having the right to vote. EUTELSAT IGO also ensures continuity of the rights to use radio frequencies of the ITU Radio regulations for the space segment which was transferred to Eutelsat S.A. Other key activities of EUTELSAT IGO include ongoing monitoring of the regulatory environment in European countries and continued collaboration with other international organisations. EUTELSAT IGO has the status of an International Organization Operating Satellite Systems (IOOSS) in all three sectors of the ITU and the Executive Secretary and Secretariat participate regularly in ITU activities and events of relevance to the Organisation. Since June 2008, EUTELSAT IGO has also held permanent Observer status with the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). The current Executive Secretary of EUTELSAT IGO is a Commissioner of the United Nations Broadband Commission for Digital Development and the Organisation is actively advocating for the work undertaken by the Commission. The 2018 Report on the State of the Broadband issued in September 2018 featured a contribution from the satellite industry. Annual tripartite meetings are organised between the Heads of EUTELSAT IGO, International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO) and International Mobile Services Organization (IMSO) with a view to discuss matters of mutual interest and give further consideration for joint initiatives. On 15 May 2019 EUTELSAT IGO signed an Agreement on Cooperation with Intersputnik giving the two organisations a mutual observer status. In addition, EUTELSAT IGO holds Observer status in Regional Commonwealth (RCC) in the field of communications, an association of several former Soviet republics, which are now independent states.  Structure  EUTELSAT IGO consists of the Assembly of Parties to the EUTELSAT Convention which meets ordinarily every two years and the Secretariat which is the permanent body of the Organisation. The Secretariat is headed by the Executive Secretary who is appointed for a four-year mandate by and is responsible to the EUTELSAT IGO Assembly of Parties. The Executive Secretary is the legal representative of EUTELSAT IGO and an observer (censeur) on the Board of Directors of Eutelsat S.A. Piotr Dmochowski-Lipski of Poland was elected the Executive Secretary by the Assembly of Parties in March 2017. He succeeded Christian Roisse of France, Executive Secretary from 2005 to 2017, and Birgitta N√§slund of Sweden, Executive Secretary from 2001 to 2005.

It deals with a brother and sister and their adventures over a lost pair of shoes. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1998. Plot The film starts with Ali fetching his little sister Zahra's pink shoes after a cobbler has repaired them. He leaves them unattended to buy some potatoes. While he is pre- occupied, a homeless man picks up the shoes, hidden in a bag, thinking it was garbage and takes them away. Frantic to find them, the young boy, thinking the shoes fell behind the crates, knocks over plates of vegetables and is chased away by the grocer. Ali's family lives in a poor South Tehran neighbourhood, and are having financial trouble, so he fears to tell his parents about the mishap. The landlord argues with Ali's mother because she is five months behind on the rent, and the grocer has not been paid in a while either. Ali tells Zahra about the shoes and begs her not to tell their mother; she agrees. That night, Ali's father scolds him for not helping his ill mother when she asked. While the siblings were doing their homework, they passed notes to each other discussing what to do. They devise a scheme to share Ali's Converse sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and return them to Ali at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. Ali does well on a test and his teacher awards him a gold-colored pen with the others in his class that got good grades; he gives it to Zahra to partially make up for losing her shoes. However, the uncomfortable arrangement between him and his sister leads to Ali being late three times in a row, no matter how hard he runs; the first time the principal ignores him, the second time he gives him a warning, the third time he tells Ali to leave and return with his father who is at work trying to make money. Ali's teacher, noticing Ali's tears, persuades the principal that Ali is at the top of his class and to give the boy one more chance and let him back into class. One day, Zahra notices her missing pink shoes on another student, Roya's, feet. After class, Zahra secretly follows Roya home. She later brings Ali with her for a confrontation, but from hiding, they discover that Roya's father is blind, so they decide to leave. When Roya does well in her studies, her father buys her new violet shoes and throws away Zahra's. Zahra is dismayed when she finds out from her new friend. Ali's father, anxious to earn more money, borrows some gardening equipment and heads off with Ali to the rich suburbs of North Tehran to find some gardening work. They try many places without success, though Ali proves to be a great help to his tongue-tied father. Finally, they come upon a mansion in which a six-year-old boy named Alireza lives under the care of his grandfather. While Ali plays with Alireza, his father works. When he is finished, Ali's father is surprised and elated by how generous the grandfather is. On the way home, Ali mentions in passing that Zahra could use a new pair of shoes; his father says that new shoes for his children is a good idea, however, their elation is short lived as their bicycle's brakes fail and the father is injured in the resulting crash. Finally, Ali learns of a high-profile children's 4 kilometer footrace involving many schools; the third prize is one week at a vacation camp and a pair of sneakers. Ali sees this as his chance to earn a new pair of shoes for Zahra. To his bitter disappointment, in a hard-fought dash to the finish, he accidentally places first instead. Ali returns home where Zahra is waiting for him. However, before he can reveal to his sister his disappointment in his placement in the race, she is called away by their mother. In a separate scene, there is a quick shot of the children's father's bicycle as he's riding home, showing a pair of white and a pair of pink shoes among his purchases. In the final shot, Ali is dejected as his sneakers are torn from the race‚Äîhe is then shown dipping his bare blistered feet in a pool. Some versions include an epilogue revealing that Ali eventually achieves success in a racing career.

It was attempted to keep the filming secret in order to capture a more realistic image of the city. The production costs have been estimated at US$180,000. The fim was distributed by Miramax. Release =Box office= Children of Heaven premiered in February 1997 at the Tehran Fajr Film Festival and was awarded several national film awards. It opened in the US on January 22, 1999, and earned a US box office total of $933,933. The worldwide total was $1,628,579. =Critical reception= Critical response to the film was highly positive. Some critics compared it to Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Roger Ebert's review in the Chicago Sun-Times called it \\"very nearly a perfect movie for children\\" that \\"lacks the cynicism and smart-mouth attitudes of so much American entertainment for kids and glows with a kind of good-hearted purity\\". In 1998, it became the first Iranian film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, losing to the Italian film Life Is Beautiful by Roberto Benigni. The majority of its US earnings came after the nomination was announced. After the film had become well known worldwide due to the Oscar nomination, it was shown in several European, South American, and Asian countries between 1999 and 2001. It was successfully shown in numerous film festivals and won awards at the Fajr Film Festival, the World Film Festival, the Newport International Film Festival, the Warsaw International Film Festival, and the Singapore International Film Festival. It competed for the Grand Prize at the American Film Institute's festival of 1997.

It is prepared from polyvinyl alcohol by reaction with butyraldehyde. The major application is laminated safety glass for automobile windshields. Trade names for PVB-films include KB PVB, Saflex, GlasNovations, Butacite, WINLITE, S-Lec, Trosifol and EVERLAM. PVB is also available as 3D printer filament that is stronger and more heat resistant than polylactic acid (PLA). Applications =Automotive and architectural= Laminated glass, commonly used in the automotive and architectural fields, comprises a protective interlayer, usually polyvinyl butyral, bonded between two panels of glass. The bonding process takes place under heat and pressure. When laminated under these conditions, the PVB interlayer becomes optically clear and binds the two panes of glass together. Once sealed together, the glass \\"sandwich\\" (i.e., laminate) behaves as a single unit and looks like normal glass. The polymer interlayer of PVB is tough and ductile, so brittle cracks will not pass from one side of the laminate to the other. =Colors= PVB interlayer can be purchased in colored sheets, such as for the blue or green \\"shade band\\" at the top edge of many automobile windshields. PVB interlayers can also be purchased in different colors for architectural laminated glass manufacture ranging from Bronze, Gray, Green, Brown, White and many more. Discovered in the late 1990s it was found that PVB degraded over time within laminated windows. =Solar modules= PVB has gained acceptance among manufacturers of photovoltaic thin film solar modules. The photovoltaic circuit is formed on a sheet of glass using thin film deposition and patterning techniques. PVB and a second sheet of glass (called back glass) are then placed directly on the circuit. The lamination of this sandwich encapsulates the circuit, protecting it from the environment. Current is extracted from the module at a sealed terminal box that is attached to the circuit through a hole in the back glass. Another common laminant used in the solar industry is ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). =Non-film applications= PVB resins (provided by the manufacturer in powdered or granulated form) are also utilized in a range of applications including technical ceramic (temporary) binders, inks, dye transfer ribbon inks, paints & coatings (including wash primers), binders for reflective sheet and binders for magnetic media. PVB resin is particularly useful at bonding to metals, ceramics and other inorganics. Properties of PVB-laminated glass Annealed glass, heat-strengthened or tempered glass can be used to produce laminated glass. While laminated glass will crack if struck with sufficient force, the resulting glass fragments tend to adhere to the interlayer rather than falling free and potentially causing injury. In practice, the interlayer provides three beneficial properties to laminated glass panes: first, the interlayer functions to distribute impact forces across a greater area of the glass panes, thus increasing the impact resistance of the glass; second, the interlayer functions to bind the resulting shards if the glass is ultimately broken; third the viscoelastic interlayer undergoes plastic deformation during impact and under static loads after impact, absorbing energy and reducing penetration by the impacting object as well as reducing the energy of the impact that is transmitted to impacting object, e.g. a passenger in a car crash. Thus, the benefits of laminated glass include safety and security. Laminated glass also has decorative applications. The interlayer can be colored or patterned. History PVB was invented in 1927 by the Canadian chemists Howard W. Matheson and Frederick W. Skirrow.Howard W. Matheson and Frederick W. Skirrow, \\"Vinyl ester resins and process of making same,\\" U.S. Patent no. 1,725,362 (filed: August 15, 1927 ; issued: August 20, 1929). PVB has been the dominant interlayer material since the late 1930s.Laminated glass containing PVB was patented in 1936. Within five years, 98% of laminated glass contained PVB. See: * Earl L. Fix, \\"Safety glass,\\" U.S. Patent no. 2,045,130 (filed: February 25, 1936 ; issued: June 23, 1936). * Fred Aftalion, A History of the International Chemical Industry, 2nd ed. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Chemical Heritage Foundation, 2001), p. 153. It is currently manufactured and marketed by a number of companies worldwide, including Eastman (Kingsport, Tennessee, USA) (Saflex-brand PVB), Sekisui (Kyoto, Japan)(Winchester, Kentucky) (Cuernavaca, Mexico)(\\"S-Lec\\" brand PVB film and powdered PVB resins), Kuraray Europe GmbH (Frankfurt, Germany) (\\"Trosifol\\"-brand PVB and \\"Mowital / Pioloform\\" for powdered PVB resins), Chang Chung Petrochemicals Co. Ltd, Taiwan (\\"WINLITE\\"-brand PVB) and EVERLAM (Hamm-Uentrop, Germany) (\\"Everlam\\" brand). The market for laminated glass products is mature. With only minor modifications, the PVB interlayer sold today is essentially identical to the PVB sold 30 years ago. Since its introduction in 1938, the worldwide market for PVB interlayer has been dominated by a handful of large chemical companies. As a result, inventive efforts have tended toward methods of making the interlayer itself cheaper to manufacture, or making the interlayer easier to handle and less prone to material defects during the process of fabricating laminated glass. Other interlayer materials Other types of interlayer materials are in use, including polyurethanes such as Duraflex-brand thermoplastic polyurethane film, manufactured by Bayer MaterialScience, Leverkusen, Germany. As used herein, the term \\"interlayer\\" refers to any material now known or developed in the future for manufacturing laminated glass. PVB and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) are explicitly included within the definition of \\"interlayer.\\" See also *Glass References  Further reading  * Study of PVB from several manufacturers that establishes the possibility of using recycled PVB from laminated glass. * (PDF; 75 kB) Category:Vinyl polymers Category:Synthetic resins Category:Transparent materials Category:Car windows ","title":"Polyvinyl butyral"},{"id":"916588","text":"George Price (June 9, 1901 - January 12, 1995) was an American cartoonist who was born in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Mission creep is usually considered undesirable due to how each success breeds more ambitious interventions until a final failure happens, stopping the intervention entirely. The term was originally applied exclusively to military operations, but has recently been applied to many different fields. The phrase first appeared in 1993, in articles published in the Washington Post and in the New York Times concerning the United Nations peacekeeping mission during the Somali Civil War. History =Somali Civil War= The first two articles to use the term in the Washington Post were both by columnist Jim Hoagland (\\"Prepared for Non- Combat\\", April 15, 1993, and Beware 'mission creep' In Somalia, July 20, 1993). The New York Times used the term for the first time in an article by correspondent John H. Cushman, Jr. written after the October 4, 1993 firefight in the capital of Somalia, Mogadishu, in which 18 American military personnel were killed. The U.S. and subsequent United Nations mission in Somalia (Restore Hope) would seem to be a classic example of mission creep. Begun in late 1992 as a U.S. humanitarian relief operation in the final months of the George H. W. Bush administration, the intervention was converted into a U.N. operation on June 4, 1993. While the initial Bush administration justification for entering Somalia focused on \\"humanitarian assistance,\\" realities on the ground helped drive ever growing requirements. On June 5, 1993, Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid's clan forces killed 23 Pakistani peacekeepers who were part of the UNISOM II mission. This battle led to a UN Security Council decision seeking to capture those responsible for the deaths of the Pakistani peacekeepers. Along with growing objectives seeking longer term stability (rather than short-term humanitarian assistance), the search for Aidid fostered a more confrontational environment through the summer of 1993. In October 1993, 18 American soldiers died in the Battle of Mogadishu. This incident led to a much more defensive U.S. and UN presence in Somalia. U.S. forces withdrew in early 1994 and all UN forces were withdrawn in late February and early March 1995 during Operation United Shield. =Libyan Civil War= The phrase was used frequently with regard to the multi-state coalition's intervention in the 2011 Libyan Civil War. It appeared as early as March 7, 2011, when a Reuters article wrote that Britain's vision of a no-fly zone over the country would be \\"likely to experience 'mission creep' and move closer to U.S. thinking on the need to target (Libyan leader) Gaddafi's defenses\\". On March 31, 2011, with the campaign in its second week, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told a Senate hearing that \\"I am preoccupied with avoiding mission creep and avoiding having an open-ended, very large- scale American commitment in this respect\\". A joint article written by the leaders of the United Kingdom, United States and France that appeared on April 14, 2011, stated that Gaddafi \\"must go, and for good\\". Some British MPs warned that this statement represented mission creep, as it exceeded the parameters of UN Resolution 1973, which stressed humanitarian objectives and did not include regime change as a stated goal. =Retroactive applications of the term= Although the term mission creep is a 1990s invention, examples can be observed throughout military history. For instance, many of the wars of Louis XIV's France began with small limited goals, but quickly escalated to much larger affairs. Another early example of mission creep is the Korean War.Exit Strategy Delusions last retrieved February 15, 2007. It began as an attempt to save South Korea from invasion by the North, but after that initial success expanded to an attempt to reunite the peninsula, a goal that eventually proved unattainable. That attempt resulted in a long and costly retreat through North Korea after the intervention of the Chinese. NBC reporter David Gregory has cited the Vietnam War as an important example of mission creep, defining it as \\"the idea of, you know, gradually surging up forces, having nation-building goals, and running into challenges all along the way.\\"JCS Speech ‚Äì Meet the Press . Joint Chiefs of Staff website. Accessed August 24, 2009. In 1956, Aneurin Bevan, politician and architect of Britain's National Health Service, gave a speech before the House of Commons on December 5 against Britain's mission creep in the Suez Crisis against Egypt. \\"I have been looking through the various objectives and reasons that the government have given to the House of Commons for making war on Egypt, and it really is desirable that when a nation makes war upon another nation it should be quite clear why it does so. It should not keep changing the reasons as time goes on.\\" The speech was considered one of the 14 greatest speeches of the 20th century by The Guardian, along with speeches by Churchill, Kennedy and Mandela. Eventually the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations played major roles in forcing Britain, France and Israel to withdraw from Egypt.Roger Owen \\"Suez Crisis\\" The Oxford Companion to the Politics of the World, Second edition. Joel Krieger, ed. Oxford University Press Inc. 2001. =Non-military examples= Another example of a non-military use of the term mission creep is in connection with fusion centers. Fusion centers were originally created as a counter-terrorism measure in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001 via the Department of Homeland Security. Fusion centers were intended to facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information across various levels of government and private sector entities connected with Americas's critical infrastructures. By 2011 there were 72 fusion centers in the United States. Fusion centers have been criticized for sharing information on crimes other than terrorism - potentially violating the civil rights of American citizens - which has been described as mission creep.Monahan, Torin (2009) The Murky World of Fusion Centres. Criminal Justice Matters 75(1): 20‚Äì21. The International Monetary Fund, founded maintain fixed exchange rates for developed countries, transitioned to funding developing countries in the 1970s. In 2005, scholars Sarah Babb and Ariel Buira remarked that the evolving goals of the IMF represented mission creep. Within recent decades U.S. police forces (and SWAT teams in particular) have become increasingly militarized and expanded in focus in a manner described by The Economist as mission creep. In the civil unrest following the death of George Floyd, protesters have widely called for the defunding and reform of police departments around the country. Proponents argue that in addition to the militarization of police, the involvement of police in non-criminal calls leads to violations of civil liberties and unnecessary police violence. Cities around the US are following the lead of Eugene, Oregon which set up a program called CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) to provide social, mental health and crisis services to the community. The service is run by trained, unarmed civilians and it fulfills a roll previously done by police. On June 11, 2020 San Francisco became the first major city in the US to announce their police department will no longer respond to non-criminal calls and instead replace it with a program similar to CAHOOTS. Non-criminal calls include disputes between neighbors, reports about homeless people, mental health, and school discipline.

The city was an agricultural and trading centre, famous for its ceramics. The name Imola was first used in the 7th century by the Lombards, who applied it to the fortress (the present Castellaccio, the construction of which is attributed to the Lombard Clefi), whence the name passed to the city itself. According to Paul the Deacon, Imola was in 412 the scene of the marriage of Ataulf, King of the Visigoths, to Galla Placidia, daughter of Emperor Theodosius the Great. In the Gothic War (535‚Äì552), and after the Lombard invasion, it was held alternately by the Byzantines and barbarians. With the exarchate of Ravenna, it passed under papal authority. In the ninth century, Fausto Alidosi defended the city against the Saracens and Hungarians. In the tenth century, Troilo Nordiglio acquired great power. This and the following centuries witnessed incessant wars against the Ravennatese, the Faentines and the Bolognese, as well as the internecine struggles of the Castrimolesi (from Castro Imolese, \\"castle of Imola\\") and the Sancassianesi (from San Cassiano). Amid these conflicts, the republican constitution of the city was created. In the contest between pope and emperor, Imola was generally Ghibelline, though it often returned to the popes (e.g. in 1248). Several times, powerful lords attempted to obtain the mastery of the city (Alidosi, 1292; Maghinardo Pagano, 1295). Pope Benedict XII turned the city and its territory over to Lippo II Alidosi with the title of pontifical vicar, the power remaining in the family Alidosi until 1424, when the condottiero Angelo della Pergola, \\"capitano\\" for Filippo Maria Visconti, gained the supremacy (see also Wars in Lombardy). In 1426 the city was restored to the Holy See, and the legate (later Cardinal) Capranica inaugurated a new regime in public affairs. Various condottieri later ruled in the city, such as the Visconti; several landmark fortresses remain from this period. In 1434, 1438, and 1470, Imola was conferred on the Sforza, who had become dukes of Milan (Lombardy). It was again brought under papal authority when it was bestowed as dowry on Caterina Sforza, the bride of Girolamo Riario, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV. Riario was invested with the Principality of Forl√¨ and Imola. This proved advantageous to Imola, which was embellished with beautiful palaces and works of art (e.g. in the cathedral, the tomb of Girolamo, murdered in 1488 by conspirators of Forli). The rule of the Riarii, however, was brief, as Pope Alexander VI deprived the son of Girolamo, Ottaviano, of power, and on 25 November 1499, the city surrendered to Cesare Borgia. After his death, two factions, that of Galeazzo Riario and that of the Church, competed for control of the city. The ecclesiastical party was victorious, and in 1504 Imola submitted to Pope Julius II. The last trace of these contests was a bitter enmity between the Vaini and Sassatelli families. Leonardo da Vinci's very accurate map of Imola, created for Cesare Borgia during the Renaissance. In 1797, the revolutionary French forces established a provisional government at Imola. In 1799, it was occupied by the Austrians, and in 1800, it was united to the Cisalpine Republic. After that, it shared the fortunes of the Romagna region.  Main sights  *Rocca Sforzesca (Sforza Castle), built under the reign of Girolamo Riario and Caterina Sforza. Now houses a Cinema d'Estate which shows films in July and August. It also is the location of the world-famous International Piano Academy \\"Incontri col Maestro\\", founded in 1989 by Franco Scala. *Palazzo Tozzoni (Tozzoni's Mansion), built between 1726 and 1738 by the architect Domenico Trifogli, civic art museum since 1981. *Duomo (cathedral), dedicated to San Cassiano. Erected from 1187 to 1271, it was repeatedly restored in the following centuries, until a large renovation was held in 1765‚Äì1781. The fa√ßade dates to 1850. *Convento dell'Osservanza, including the church of San Michele from 1472, to which later a convent with two cloisters was added. It houses a sarcophagus of Lucrezia Landriani (1496), mother of Caterina Sforza. The interior has a nave and an aisles, finished in 1942; it houses a fresco attributed to Guidaccio da Imola (1472). In the apse is a Byzantine-style crucifix from the 15th century. The first cloister, dating to 1590, had originally 35 frescoes of stories of St. Francis, 15 of which went lost. In the garden annexed to the church is a precious Piet√† in terracotta of late-15th century Bolognese or Faenza school. *Santuario della Beata Vergine del Piratello and Cimitero del Piratello. On 27 March 1483 a pilgrim named Stefano Manganelli witnessed a miracle at Piratello in which a vision of the Madonna requested that the people of Imola build her a shrine, leading to the establishment of a monastery and the Santuario della Beata Vergine. The monastery was dissolved during the Napoleonic suppressions of the early 1800s The Cimitero del Piratello was authorized in 1817 and opened several years later, occupying the former convent cloisters adjacent to the Santuario (designated a Basilica by Pope Pius XII in 1954). The cemetery was further developed in 1916 with the addition of the Campo Monumentale. Other buildings include the Farsetti and the Communal palaces. In the latter is a fresco representing Clement VII and Charles V (1535) passing through the city. The public library was established in 1747 by the Conventual Padre Setti. In the 16th century, the Accademia degli Industriosi flourished. =Green areas= *The Acque Minerali Park, located next to Santerno river, on the hills of the city. The park was created in the beginning of the 20th century; the discovery of the mineral water occurred in 1830 *The Tozzoni Park, located on a big hilly area on the side of the city; it became a public area in 1978. The Tozzoni family bought the park in 1882 and used it as a hunting reserve, naming it \\"Parco del Monte\\" (Italian: \\"Park of the Mountain\\").

Along with acting as a semi-permeable membrane, the endothelium is responsible for maintaining vascular tone and regulating oxidative stress by releasing mediators, such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin and endothelin, and controlling local angiotensin-II activity. Research = Atherosclerosis = Endothelial dysfunction may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis and may predate vascular pathology. = Nitric oxide= Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses platelet aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, and leukocyte adhesion. A feature of endothelial dysfunction is the inability of arteries and arterioles to dilate fully in response to an appropriate stimulus, such as exogenous nitroglycerine, that stimulates release of vasodilators from the endothelium like NO. Endothelial dysfunction is commonly associated with decreased NO bioavailability, which is due to impaired NO production by the endothelium or inactivation of NO by reactive oxygen species. = Testing and diagnosis = In the coronary circulation, angiography of coronary artery responses to vasoactive agents may be used to test for endothelial function, and venous occlusion plethysmography and ultrasonography are used to assess endothelial function of peripheral vessels in humans. A non-invasive method to measure endothelial dysfunction is % Flow- Mediated Dilation (FMD) as measured by Brachial Artery Ultrasound Imaging (BAUI). Current measurements of endothelial function via FMD vary due to technical and physiological factors. Furthermore, a negative correlation between percent flow mediated dilation and baseline artery size is recognised as a fundamental scaling problem, leading to biased estimates of endothelial function. A non-invasive, FDA-approved device for measuring endothelial function that works by measuring Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) is Itamar Medical‚Äôs EndoPAT. It has shown an 80% sensitivity and 86% specificity to diagnose coronary artery disease when compared against the gold standard, acetylcholine angiogram. This results suggests that this peripheral test reflects the physiology of the coronary endothelium. Since NO maintains low tone and high compliance of the small arteries at rest, a reduction of age- dependent small artery compliance is a marker for endothelial dysfunction that is associated with both functional and structural changes in the microcirculation. Small artery compliance or stiffness can be assessed simply and at rest and can be distinguished from large artery stiffness by use of pulsewave analysis. = Endothelial dysfunction and stents = Stent implantation has been correlated with impaired endothelial function in several studies. Sirolimus eluting stents were previously used because they showed low rates of in-stent restenosis, but further investigation showed that they often impair endothelial function in humans and worsen conditions. One drug used to inhibit restenosis is iopromide-paclitaxel. = Risk reduction = Treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may improve endothelial function in people taking statins (HMGCoA-reductase inhibitor), and renin angiotensin system inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.

A person doing such is called a beggar or panhandler. Beggars may operate in public places such as transport routes, urban parks, and markets. Besides money, they may also ask for food, drink, cigarettes or other small items. Internet begging is the modern practice of asking people to give money to others via the Internet, rather than in person. Internet begging is usually targeted at people who are acquainted with the beggar, but it may be advertised to strangers. Internet begging may encompass requests for help meeting basic needs such as medical care and shelter, as well as requests for people to pay for vacations, school trips, and other things that the beggar wants but cannot comfortably afford. Beggars differ from religious mendicants in that some mendicants do not ask for money. Their subsistence is reciprocated by providing society with various forms of religious service, moral education, and preservation of culture. History Beggars have existed in human society since before the dawn of recorded history. Street begging has happened in most societies around the world, though its prevalence and exact form vary. A beggar in Uppsala, Sweden. June 2014. =Greece= Ancient Greeks distinguished between the p√©nƒìs (Greek: œÄŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ, \\"active poor\\") and the pt≈çch√≥s (Greek: œÄœÑœâœáœåœÇ, \\"passive poor\\"). The penes was somebody with a job, only not enough to make a living, while the ptochos depended on others entirely. The working poor were accorded a higher social status. The New Testament contains several references to Jesus' status as the savior of the ptochos, usually translated as \\"the poor\\", considered the most wretched portion of society. In the Rich man and Lazarus parable, Lazarus is called 'ptochos' and presented as living in extreme poverty. =Britain= Portrait of a Blind Beggar, Glamorganshire, George Orleans Delamotte, 1818 A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds, was first published in 1566 by Thomas Harman. From early modern England, another example is Robert Greene in his coney-catching pamphlets, the titles of which included \\"The Defence of Conny-catching,\\" in which he argued there were worse crimes to be found among \\"reputable\\" people. The Beggar's Opera is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay. The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew was first published in 1745. There are similar writers for many European countries in the early modern period. According to Jackson J. Spielvogel, \\"Poverty was a highly visible problem in the eighteenth century, both in cities and in the countryside... Beggars in Bologna were estimated at 25 percent of the population; in Mainz, figures indicate that 30 percent of the people were beggars or prostitutes... In France and Britain by the end of the century, an estimated 10 percent of the people depended on charity or begging for their food.\\"Jackson J. Spielvogel (2008). \\"Western Civilization: Since 1500\\". Cengage Learning. p.566. The British Poor Laws, dating from the Renaissance, placed various restrictions on begging. At various times, begging was restricted to the disabled. This system developed into the workhouse, a state-operated institution where those unable to obtain other employment were forced to work in often grim conditions in exchange for a small amount of food. The welfare state of the 20th century greatly reduced the number of beggars by directly providing for the basic necessities of the poor from state funds. =India = A street beggar in India gets into a car (Calcutta Kolkata) Begging is an age-old social phenomenon in India. In the medieval and earlier times begging was considered to be an acceptable occupation which was embraced within the traditional social structure. This system of begging and alms-giving to mendicants and the poor is still widely practiced in India, with over 400,000 beggars in 2015. In contemporary India, beggars are often stigmatized as undeserving. People often believe that beggars are not destitute and instead call them professional beggars. There is a wide perception of begging scams. This view is refuted by grassroots research organizations such as Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan, which claim that beggars and other homeless people are overwhelmingly destitute and vulnerable. Their studies indicate that 99 percent men and 97 percent women resort to beggary due to abject poverty, distress migration from rural villages and the unavailability of employment. = China =  Ming Dynasty  After the establishment of the Ming dynasty many farmers and unemployed laborers in Beijing were forced to beg to survive. Begging was especially difficult during Ming times due to high taxes that limited the disposable income of most individuals. Beijing's harsh winters were a difficult challenge for beggars. To avoid freezing to death, some beggars paid porters one copper coin to sleep in their warehouse for the night. Others turned to burying themselves in manure and eating arsenic to avoid the pain of the cold. Thousands of beggars died of poison and exposure to the elements every year. Begging was some people's primary occupation. A Qing dynasty source describes that \\"professional beggars\\" were not considered to be destitute, and as such were not allowed to receive government relief, such as food rations, clothing, and shelter. Beggars would often perform or train animals to perform to earn coins from passerby. Although beggars were of low status in Ming, they were considered to have higher social standing over prostitutes, entertainers, runners, and soldiers. Some individuals capitalized on beggars and became \\"Beggar Chiefs\\". Beggar chiefs provided security in the form of food for beggars and in return received a portion of beggars daily earnings as tribute. Beggar chiefs would often lend out their surplus income back to beggars and charge interest, furthering their subjects dependence on them to the point of near slavery. Although beggar chiefs could acquire significant wealth they were still looked upon as low class citizens. The title of beggar chief was often passed through family line and could stick with an individual through occupational changes. Religious begging A mendicant outside ‚ÄòKalkaji Mandir‚Äô in Delhi, India Many religions have prescribed begging as the only acceptable means of support for certain classes of adherents, including Hinduism, Sufism, Buddhism, and typically to provide a way for certain adherents to focus exclusively on spiritual development without the possibility of becoming caught up in worldly affairs. Religious ideals of ‚ÄòBhiksha‚Äô in Hinduism, ‚ÄòCharity‚Äô in Christianity besides others promote alms- giving. This obligation of making gifts to God by alms-giving explains the occurrence of generous donations outside religious sites like temples and mosques to mendicants begging in the name of God. Tzedakah plays a central role in Judaism. The Jewish practice of maaser kesafim requires a contribution of 10% of one's income as a monetary tithe, mostly to be given to the poor. In Buddhism, monks and nuns traditionally live by begging for alms, as done by the historical Gautama Buddha himself. This is, among other reasons, so that Laity can gain religious merit by giving food, medicines, and other essential items to the monks. The monks seldom need to plead for food; in villages and towns throughout modern Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and other Buddhist countries, householders can often be found at dawn every morning streaming down the road to the local temple to give food to the monks. In East Asia, monks and nuns were expected to farm or work for returns to feed themselves. Ming China was founded by former beggar Zhu Yuanzhang. Orphaned in childhood due to famine, Zhu Yuanzhang, turned to the Huangjue temple for help. When the temple ran out of resources to support its occupants he became a mendicant monk traveling China begging for food. Legal restrictions Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The meter accepts donations for charitable efforts as part of an official effort to discourage panhandling. Begging has been restricted or prohibited at various times and for various reasons, typically revolving around a desire to preserve public order or to induce people to work rather than to beg. Various European Poor Laws prohibited or regulated begging from the Renaissance to modern times, with varying levels of effectiveness and enforcement. Similar laws were adopted by many developing countries. \\"Aggressive panhandling\\" has been specifically prohibited by law in various jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, typically defined as persistent or intimidating begging. =Australia= Each state and territory in Australia has specific laws regarding begging and panhandling. Begging for alms is illegal in Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania. =Austria= There is no nationwide ban but it is illegal in several federal states. =Belarus= It is legal to beg in Belarus =Bulgaria= Systematic begging is illegal in Bulgaria by article 329 of the penal code. =Canada= The province of Ontario introduced its Safe Streets Act in 1999 to restrict specific kinds of begging, particularly certain narrowly defined cases of \\"aggressive\\" or abusive begging. In 2001 this law was upheld under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The law was further upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in January 2007. One response to the anti-panhandling laws which were passed was the creation of the Ottawa Panhandlers Union which fights for the political rights of panhandlers. The union is a shop of the Industrial Workers of the World. British Columbia enacted its own Safe Streets Act in 2004 which resembles the Ontario law. There are also critics in that province who oppose such laws. =China= Begging in China is illegal if: * Coercing, decoying or utilizing others to beg; * Forcing others to beg, repeatedly tangling or using other means of nuisance. Those cases are violations of the Article 41 of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People's Republic of China. For the first case, offenders would receive a detention between 10 days and 15 days, with an additional fine under RMB 1,000; for the second case, it is punishable by a 5-day detention or warning. According to Article 262(2) or the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, organizing disabled or children under 14 to beg is illegal and will be punished by up to 7 years in prison, and fined. =Denmark= Historically beggars were controlled by the Stodderkonge or 'beggar king' for a town or district. Today, begging in Denmark is illegal under section 197 of the penal code, which reads: Furthermore, begging which causes insecurity in the streets (so-called utryghedsskabende tiggeri) has a harsher penalty of up to 14 days prison. =England & Wales= Begging is illegal under the Vagrancy Act of 1824. However it does not carry a jail sentence and is not enforced in many cities, although since the Act applies in all public places, it is enforced more frequently on public transport. Local authorities may issue public spaces protection orders for particular areas which makes begging subject to a fine. =Finland= Begging has been legal in Finland since 1987 when the poor law was invalidated. In 2003, the Public Order Act replaced local government rules and decriminalized begging. =France= 218x218px A law against begging ended in 1994 but begging with aggressive animals or children is still outlawed. =Greece= A woman begging at traffic lights in Patras, Greece. Under article 407 of the Greek Penal Code, begging was punishable by up to 6 months in jail and up to a 3000 euro fine. However, this law was repelled in October 2018, after protests from street musicians in the city of Thessaloniki. =Hungary= Hungary has a nationwide ban. This may include stricter related laws in cities such as Budapest, which also prohibits picking things from rubbish bins. =India= Begging is criminalized in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi as per the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, BPBA (1959). Under this law, officials of the Social Welfare Department assisted by the police, conduct raids to pick up beggars who they then try in special courts called ‚Äòbeggar courts‚Äô. If convicted, they are sent to certified institutions called ‚Äòbeggar homes‚Äô also known as ‚ÄòSewa Kutir‚Äô for a period ranging from one to ten years for detention, training and employment. The government of Delhi, besides criminalizing alms-seeking has also criminalized alms-giving on traffic signals to reduce the ‚Äònuisance‚Äô of begging and ensure the smooth flow of traffic. Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan and People's Union of Civil Liberties, PUCL have critiqued this Act and advocated for its repeal. Section 2(1) of the BPBA broadly defines ‚Äòbeggars‚Äô as those individuals who directly solicit alms as well as those who have no visible means of subsistence and are found wandering around as beggars. Therefore, during the implementation of this law the homeless are often mistaken as beggars. Beggar homes, which are meant to provide vocational training, have been often found to have abysmal living conditions. =Republic of Ireland= \\"Passive\\" begging is legal in the Republic of Ireland, but begging \\"in an aggressive, intimidating or threatening manner\\" is illegal, punishable by a fine. Garda√≠ (police) can also direct people begging in certain areas to move on, e.g. at an ATM, night safe, vending machine or shop entrance. It is also illegal to \\"organise or direct someone else to beg;\\" under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011, punishable by a ‚Ç¨200,000 fine or up to 5 years in prison; this law was adopted in response to organised begging by Romani gangs.https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/03/26/news/judge- hits-out-at-gang-of-professional-beggars-who-fly-in-and-out-of-romania-in- shifts-1582339/ Prior to this law, begging was outlawed by the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847, adopted during the Great Famine; a 2007 High Court ruling said that it was \\"too vague and incompatible with constitutional provisions allowing free speech and freedom to communicate.\\" =Italy= Begging with children or animals is forbidden, but the law is not enforced. =Japan= Buddhist monks appear in public when begging for alms. Although homelessness in Japan is common, such people rarely beg. =Korea= Most cases of begging are illegal. Especially, if it annoys someone, or bothers the traffic, or is for a personal purpose. =Latvia= Begging was made illegal in the historic city center of Riga in 2012. Begging in Riga outside the historic city center requires that the beggar carries ID. =Lithuania= It is illegal to beg in the capital Vilnius and it is also illegal to give money to a beggar. Both can receive a fine of up to 2000 litas (770‚Ç¨) =Luxembourg= Begging in Luxembourg is legal, except when it is indulged in as a group or the beggar is a part of an organised effort. According to Chachipe, a Roma rights advocacy NGO, 1639 begging cases were reported by Luxembourgian law enforcement authorities. Roma beggars were arrested, handcuffed, taken to police stations and held for hours and had their money confiscated. = Nepal = Although the Begging (Prohibition) Act was introduced in 1962, this has not been enforced and the begging population in the capital, Kathmandu has since grown to over 5,000, according to police estimates. Besides the common begging tricks such as asking for money or asking for milk which will be returned to the shop for money, there is a unique scam in Nepal which involves asking a foreigner to buy a shoe box at an inflated price. This shoe box is claimed to help provide a sustainable livelihood for the beggar but in actual fact, will be returned to the seller for money. =Norway= Begging is banned in some counties and there were plans for a nationwide ban in 2015, however this was dropped after the Centre Party withdrew their support.175x175px =Philippines= Begging is prohibited in the Philippines under the Anti-Mendicancy Law of 1978 although this is not strictly enforced. =Poland= In Poland it is illegal to beg under the Code of petty offences, if they are able to hold a job. The beggar is due to a fine of 365‚Ç¨. =Portugal= In Portugal, panhandlers normally beg in front of Catholic churches, at traffic lights or on special places in Lisbon or Oporto downtowns. Begging is legal in Portugal. Many social and religious institutions support homeless people and panhandlers and the Portuguese Social Security normally gives them a survival monetary subsidy. = Qatar = Under the article 278 of the Qatari penal code, the maximum sentence for begging is one year. This sentence was increased from a maximum of three months before July 2006. The alternative is housing in a specialized correctional facility. The money will be confiscated in any case. This law is enforced, with a police division dedicated solely for that purpose. =Romania= Law 61 of 1991 forbids the persistent call for the mercy of the public, by a person who is able to work. US State Department Human Rights reports note a pattern of Roma children registered for \\"vagrancy and begging\\".In a 1786 174x174px =United States= In parts of San Francisco, California, aggressive panhandling is prohibited.Debate Continues Over Proposed Sit-Lie Ordinance , KTVU, 10 March 2010 In May 2010, police in the city of Boston started cracking down on panhandling in the streets in downtown, and were conducting an educational outreach to residents advising them not to give to panhandlers. The Boston police distinguished active solicitation, or aggressive panhandling, versus passive panhandling of which an example is opening doors at a store with a cup in hand but saying nothing.Schuler, Melina, \\"Cops Planning to Combat Panhandling\\", The Boston Courant, May 14‚Äì20 issue, 2010. \\"Aggressive solicitation is against the law and is defined as an action that is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear harm or to intimidate him or her into compliance, Ivens said. Passive panhandling, like in front of a convenience store, is constitutionally allowed, however, it is a violation of a Boston ordinance to do it within 10 feet [3 m] of an ATM, bank, or check cashing business during hours of operation, [Boston Police Captain Paul] Ivens said.\\" U. S. Courts have repeatedly ruled that begging is protected by the First Amendment's free speech provisions. On August 14, 2013, the U. S. Court of Appeals struck down a Grand Rapids, Michigan anti-begging law on free speech grounds.John Agar, \\"Michigan's begging law violates First Amendment: federal appeals court\\" mlive.com An Arcata, California law banning panhandling within twenty feet of stores was struck down on similar grounds in 2012. Use of funds A beggar in Denver, Colorado in 2018. A man holding a sign using humor for begging A 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 Canadian dollars (CAD) ‚Äì those interviewed spent a median of $200 on food and $192 on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. The Fraser Institute criticized this study, citing problems with potential exclusion of lucrative forms of begging and the unreliability of reports from the panhandlers who were polled in the study. In North America, panhandling money is widely reported to support substance abuse and other addictions.

The first entry in the Red Dead series, it was released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May 2004. Set in the 1880s, during the American frontier, the game follows the story of bounty hunter Red Harlow as he attempts to exact revenge on those responsible for his parents' murder. Angel Studios (later called Rockstar San Diego) began working on Red Dead Revolver under the oversight and funding of Japanese video game publisher Capcom in 2000, and the game was announced by Capcom in March 2002. It was originally intended to be a spiritual successor to Capcom's Gun.Smoke, a 1985 arcade shoot 'em up designed by Yoshiki Okamoto. Red Dead Revolvers successor, Red Dead Redemption, was released in May 2010.  Gameplay  Red Dead Revolver is a third-person shooter and action-adventure game. It contains multiple levels which see players engage enemies in gunfights using a variety of weapons, ranging from handguns to shotguns and throwable weapons, such as hunting knives, molotov cocktails, and dynamite. More weapons can be purchased at the end of each level. Levels usually end with a boss fight, and each boss has a bounty on their head that is collected once they are killed. Each level uses a rating system that rewards players with unlockable content, such as new weapons or characters for the game's multiplayer component, depending on how well they completed specific objectives, such as the time taken to finish the level or weapon accuracy. Though the game lacks an open-world, players may freely explore the small town of Brimstone between levels, where they can interact with NPCs. Throughout the storyline, players assume the role of bounty hunter Red Harlow, though some levels offer control over other characters, such as English trick-shootist Jack Swift, rancher Annie Stoakes, Mexican Army General Diego, Red's Native American cousin Shadow Wolf, and an African American U.S. soldier known only as the \\"Buffalo Soldier.\\" Each playable character has a unique signature weapon. A game mechanic also present in future Red Dead games is \\"Dead Eye\\", a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, the player character automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession. The game also includes duels, which utilize Dead Eye and contain four stages: grabbing, where the player controls the character's hand and must direct it towards the weapon; drawing, where the player moves the right analog stick back up to remove the weapon from its holster once it has been grabbed; acquiring locks, where the right analog stick is used to move the crosshairs over the opponent's body and place several targets, which may be either yellow, dark red, or light red, depending on how critical that point is; and finally the shooting itself, where the player character automatically fires bullets in rapid succession and may either instantly kill the opponent, or simply damage them, in which case the player will be hit, though if it is not critical, they will quickly get up and may finish off the opponent using regular shooting. The game also includes a local multiplayer component, which can be played by either one or two players, alongside two AIs. Here, the gameplay consists entirely of free-for-all battles, with the last man standing winning. Battles take place in maps from the single-player campaign, and both players and AIs use character models based on characters from the game's storyline, though there are also a few original ones. Plot In the 1870s, Nate Harlow (Kurt Rhoads) and Griff (Bert Pence) find gold in an area called Bear Mountain and celebrate by building two unique revolvers. Griff is later captured by the Mexican Army and sentenced to death, but convinces General Diego (Robert Jimenez) to spare him after offering him half of the gold in Bear Mountain. Diego later sends his right-hand man, Colonel Daren (Dennis Ostermaier), to kill Nate, the only other person who knows about the gold. Daren and his men kill Nate and his wife, Falling Star (Messeret Stroman), but their son Red (Jason Fuchs) escapes after shooting off Daren's left arm with his father's revolver. Years later, Red (Robert Bogue) has become a ruthless bounty hunter. After killing an outlaw gang led by \\"Bloody Tom\\" (Christian Tanno), he takes their bodies to the town of Widows Patch for the bounty on their heads, only to be attacked by a rival gang led by \\"Ugly Chris\\" (Erick Devine). With local Sheriff O'Grady's assistance (Stephen Schnetzer), Red kills them, but O'Grady is badly wounded, so Red takes him to Brimstone, the nearest town with a doctor, foiling a train robbery on the way there. After Red drops O'Grady off, Brimstone's Sheriff Bartlett (Gene Jones) asks him for assistance in dealing with several gangs terrorizing the area. Red first eliminates an evil traveling circus, aided by English trick-shootist and former circus member Jack Swift (Gregg Martin), before going after other well- known gang leaders. After eliminating all gang leaders, Red returns to Bartlett to claim the bounties on their heads, only to learn the gold wagon hasn't arrived yet. At the Brimstone Bank, Red learns that Governor Griffon owns part of Bear Mountain and meets local rancher Annie Stoakes (Carrie Keranen), who is about to lose her farm to Griffon. Recalling that his family was killed over that very mine, Red goes to discuss the issue with Annie, just as her farm is destroyed by Griffon's men, prompting Red to promise her his bounty money. Later, Red goes to a saloon to question some local thugs on the gold wagon's whereabouts. When they refuse to talk, a fight ensues, leading to Red being arrested by Bartlett, though he releases him upon learning he is Nate's son, and reveals that General Diego and Colonel Daren are still alive and court bound. Red leaves to destroy Diego's supply wagon, but is captured by Daren and forced to work at Bear Mountain as a slave. While imprisoned, Red befriends a U.S. soldier known only as \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" (Benton Greene), before the pair are rescued by Red's Native American cousin Shadow Wolf (Chaske Spencer). After escaping from the mines, Red and Shadow Wolf attack Diego's fortress and kill Daren, though Shadow Wolf is mortally wounded. Red later tracks down and destroys Diego's gold wagon, finally killing the general. Meanwhile, Buffalo Soldier makes his way to Brimstone to inform Governor Griffon of Diego's operations, but the governor reveals he is affiliated with Diego and has Buffalo imprisoned once again. Some time later, Red, Annie, and Jack participate in Brimstone's yearly quick-draw competition hosted by Griffon and Bartlett. After Red defeats all his opponents, Griffon disqualifies Annie and Jack, leaving only Red and four time champion Mr. Kelley (Joseph Melendez) to compete. Following Kelley's defeat, a frustrated Griffon pulls out his revolver to kill Red, which is identical to his, leading Red to conclude that Griffon is actually Griff and that he was also involved in his father's death. As Griffon makes his escape, he orders a still-living Kelley to kill Red, who murders him instead. Afterward, aided by Annie, Jack, and Bartlett, Red storms Griffon's mansion and kills all his goons, before finally confronting the governor on the rooftop. The two engage in a climatic duel that results in Griffon's death. Following the battle, Red is saddened to learn that Jack was killed, but is grateful that he sacrificed himself to help him avenge his parents' murder. Bartlett proceeds to thank Red for all the good he has done for the people of Brimstone and offers to pay him the gold he is owed, but Red tells him to give it to Annie instead, to rebuild her farm and help Buffalo Soldier (whom she rescued during the battle), thus honoring his promise to her. Advised by Bartlett to leave before he is arrested for Griffon's murder, Red grabs the governor's revolver and departs, while claiming that \\"It never was about the money.\\" Development The project originally stemmed from Angel Studios and Capcom's partnership on the Resident Evil 2 port for the Nintendo 64. Capcom's Yoshiki Okamoto then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original intellectual property entitled S.W.A.T. It later adopted a Western theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \\"Spaghetti Western Action Team\\". It was intended to be a spiritual successor to Capcom's Gun.Smoke, a 1985 arcade shoot 'em up originally designed by Yoshiki Okamoto. Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game in March 2002. Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable. In November 2002, Take-Two Interactive, parent company of Rockstar Games, announced that they had acquired Angel Studios, with it being moved to the Rockstar Games label and being renamed Rockstar San Diego. Following the purchase, Rockstar Games executives reviewed projects in development at the studio, so to sort out what was worth keeping. Dan Houser, creative director at Rockstar Games, remarked that the game \\"looked very good\\" and caught the review team's eyes, despite it being in an unplayable state. The troubled development led to that unplayable state of the game, with it missing both the 2002 European Computer Trade Show and the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Okamoto then left Capcom, which eventually cancelled the title in August 2003. However, Rockstar Games acquired the rights to Red Dead Revolver the following December, and let Rockstar San Diego go on to develop what would become the first installment in the acclaimed Red Dead series. Reception Red Dead Revolver received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Capcom on May 25, 2005, almost two years after the company had cancelled the title, Famitsu gave it a score of 31 out of 40. The Times gave it four stars out of five, saying that it \\"has a strong, coherent storyline that whisks Red from novice gunslinger to competent bounty hunter in what proves to be the mother of all shooting practice games.\\" Maxim similarly gave it four stars out of five, saying that \\"Show-offs can even stealthily duck behind cover and shoot at foes' feet to make 'em jig like Michael Flatley sans Ritalin.\\" However, Entertainment Weekly gave it a C and said that \\"The game misses its mark: Instead of the gritty, scrub-brush humor of a Sergio Leone pic, Revolver feels like a rootin'-tootin' Disneyland ride.\\" In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. =Sales= According to market research firm The NPD Group, Red Dead Revolver sold 140,000 units during June 2004 and had lifetime sales of 920,000 by July 2010. Sequels The first glimpse at a sequel was in 2005 when Rockstar showed a teaser at a Sony press conference. The successor to Red Dead Revolver, Red Dead Redemption, was officially announced for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009. After a few delays in release dates, it was finally released on May 18, 2010 in North America, and on May 21, 2010 in Europe and Australia to critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the game's gameplay and technical improvements over its predecessor. Red Dead Redemption 2 was confirmed by Rockstar in October 2016, and was released on October 26, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was released for Microsoft Windows on November 5, 2019.

The term \\"Protoculture Addicts\\" was also used by the Zentradi (an alien race that appeared in the Macross series) to refer to all the races that have been in contact with Protoculture. Although it was a North American publication, it also covered many things about the state of anime and manga in France and the French-speaking world. Manga and anime are readily available in Europe, and the magazine was started in Montreal, Quebec, a francophone region of Canada with a mixture of French and English speakers. History Protoculture Addicts was the first large mainstream anime and manga magazine in North America. Its name derives from the popularity of the Robotech anime series, and its namesake, Protoculture. It started as a Robotech fanzine, became officially licensed as such, and then expanded to cover anime in general. Many of the series that it reviewed and presented details of, including spoilers, were months in advance of legal release in the English-speaking West. The first test release, Issue #0, was published by Claude J. Pelletier in the fall of 1987. Issue #1 officially launched the fanzine in the spring of 1988. It later became a standard commercial magazine. =Acquisition by Anime News Network= In 2005, with Issue #82, Protoculture Addicts became Anime News Network's Protoculture Addicts, a sister publication to popular anime news and information website Anime News Network. In May 2006, the first full color issue (#88) of Protoculture Addicts was released with the addition of a manga insert and several changes based on the readers feedback. Issue #89 was published later in end November and returned to its bimonthly schedule. =End of regular production= The last regularly released issue of Protoculture Addicts was #97, the July/August 2008 edition. This was a symptom of the general collapse of the North American anime market which occurred throughout 2008 following the closure of Geneon USA in September 2007 However, it was also the result of increased competition with anime news websites, such as Anime News Network itself. Only a few months before, Newtype USA shut down in February 2008 This was followed not long afterwards by the closure of Anime Insider magazine in March 2009, the last anime news magazine published on a monthly basis in North America. The magazine still technically exists, though only as a neglected subsidiary of Anime News Network, and for all intents and purposes it has been directly absorbed by ANN. According to their forum, Anime News Network officially discontinued efforts to release Protoculture Addicts as a regularly released magazine with issue #97, but hoped to continue the name as a bi-annual trade paperback, not focusing on news (a function which had been supplanted by the internet) but on special features and reviews. However, the project has not been given a high priority, and only two staffers were assigned to gradually produce the special trade-paperback issue, which was still going to be numbered \\"Protoculture Addicts #98\\" to continue the legacy of the original magazine. A new issue of Protoculture Addicts had not been published since 2008. This leaves Otaku USA as the only regularly published anime news magazine in North America, which is published on a bi- monthly schedule.

Its rohe (tribal area) extends from Whanganui in the north, Palmerston North in the east, and Kaikoura and Hokitika in the south. NgƒÅti Toa remains a small iwi with a population of only about 4500 (NZ Census 2001). It has four marae: Takap≈´wƒÅhia and Hongoeka in Porirua City, and Whakat≈´ and Wairau in the north of the South Island. NgƒÅti Toa's governing body has the name Te R≈´nanga o Toa Rangatira. The iwi traces its descent from the eponymous ancestor Toarangatira. Prior to the 1820s, NgƒÅti Toa lived on the coastal west Waikato region until forced out by conflict with other Tainui iwi headed by P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero ( 1785 - 1860), who later became the first MƒÅori King (). NgƒÅti Toa, NgƒÅti RƒÅrua and NgƒÅti Koata, led by Te Rauparaha ( 1765-1849), escaped south and invaded Taranaki and the Wellington regions together with three North Taranaki iwi, Te ƒÄti Awa, NgƒÅti Tama and NgƒÅti Mutunga. Together they fought with and conquered the turangawaewae turangawaewae of Wellington, NgƒÅti Ira, wiping out their existence as an independent iwi. After the 1820s, the region conquered by NgƒÅti Toa extended from Miria-te-kakara at Rangitikei to Wellington, and across Cook Strait to Wairau and Nelson. [NZETC: HISTORY AND TRADITIONS OF THE MAORIS OF THE WEST COAST, NORTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALAND, PRIOR TO 1840 ‚Äì Ngati-Ira of Port Nicholson. p408-410] Traditional sayings A saying delineates the tribe's traditional boundaries: However the tribe mainly lives around Porirua and Nelson. An aphorism links tribal identity with ancestors and landmarks:  History  =Origins of the iwi= Tupahau, a descendant of Hoturoa, the captain of the Tainui canoe, received warning of an imminent attack by Tamure, a priest of Tainui, and at once organised a plan of defence and attack. Tamure had an army of 2000 warriors whereas Tupahau had only 300. Tupahau and his followers won the battle, however Tupahau spared Tamure's life. Tamure responded to this by saying, TƒìnƒÅ koe Tupahau, te toa rangatira! meaning \\"Hail Tupahau the chivalrous warrior!\\" (toa meaning \\"brave man\\" or \\"champion\\" and rangatira meaning \\"gallant\\", \\"grand\\", \\"admirable\\" or \\"chiefly\\"). Later, Tupahau's daughter-in-law bore a son who received the name \\"Toarangatira\\" to commemorate both this event and the subsequent peace made between Tamure and Tupahau. NgƒÅti Toa trace their descent from Toarangatira. = Te Rauparaha = Parekowhatu of NgƒÅti Raukawa, the wife of Werawera of NgƒÅti Toa, gave birth to Te Rauparaha in about the 1760s. According to tribal tradition the birth took place at PƒÅtangata near KƒÅwhia. Te Rauparaha became the foremost chief of NgƒÅti Toa, credited with leading NgƒÅti Toa forces against the Waikato and NgƒÅti Maniapoto iwi and then, after his defeat, with piloting the migration to, and the conquest and settlement of, the Cook Strait region in the 1820s. Later he crossed Cook Strait to attack the Rangitane people in the Wairau valley. His attempt to conquer the southern South Island iwi was thwarted by an outbreak of measles which killed many of his warriors. Te Rauparaha signed the Treaty of Waitangi twice in May and June 1840: first at Kapiti Island and then again at Wairau. Te Rauparaha resisted European settlement in those areas which he claimed he had not sold. Later disputes occurred over Porirua and the Hutt Valley. But the major clash came in 1843 when Te Rauparaha and his nephew Te Rangihaeata tried to prevent the survey of lands in the Wairau plains. These lands had been claimed by the New Zealand Company \\"on two grounds ‚Äì alleged purchase by Captain Blenkinsop, master of a Sydney whaler in 1831-2; and the negotiations between their principal agent (Colonel Wakefield) and Rauparaha, the head of this tribe, in 1839\\". (p. 50) Te Rauparaha burnt down a whare which contained survey equipment. The Nelson magistrate ordered his arrest and deputised a number of citizens as police. Te Rauparaha resisted arrest and fighting broke out, resulting in the death of Te Rongo, the wife of Te Rangihaeata. Te Rangihaeata, who was known as a savage warrior, then killed the survey-party, who had surrendered, to avenge his wife's death in an act of utu. This became known as the Wairau Affray or until modern times, the Wairau massacre, as most of the Europeans were killed after the fighting had stopped. Following fighting in the Hutt Valley in 1846, Governor George Grey arrested Te Rauparaha after British troops discovered he was receiving and sending secret instructions to the local Maori who were attacking settlers. In a surprise attack on his pa, Te Rauparaha, who was now quite elderly, was captured and taken prisoner of war. The government held him as a prisoner for 10 months and then kept him under house arrest in Auckland on board a prison ship, the Driver. After his capture fighting stopped in the Wellington region. Te Rauparaha was released to attend a Maori peace conference at Kohimaramara in Auckland and then given his liberty after giving up any claim to the Wairau valley. Te Rauparaha's last notable achievement came with the construction of RangiƒÅtea Church (1846) in ≈åtaki. He did not adopt Christianity, although he attended church services. Te Rauparaha died on 27 November 1849, aged about 85, and was buried near RangiƒÅtea, in Otaki. Many remember him as the author of the haka \\"Ka mate, ka mate\\", which he composed after being hidden in a rua (potato pit) by a woman in the Taupo region after a defeat in battle.Royal, Te Ahukaram≈´ Charles, KƒÅti au i konei: He Kohikohinga i ngƒÅ Waiata a NgƒÅti Toarangatira, a NgƒÅti Raukawa. Wellington: Huia Publishers, 1994. = Invasion from the north = NgƒÅti Toa lived around the KƒÅwhia region for many generations until increasing conflicts with neighbouring Waikato‚ÄìManiapoto iwi forced a withdrawal from their homeland. From the late eighteenth century NgƒÅti Toa and related tribes constantly warred with the Waikato‚ÄìManiapoto tribes for control of the rich fertile land north of KƒÅwhia. The wars intensified with every killing of a major chief and with each insult and slight suffered, peaking with the huge battle of Hingakaka in the late 18th or early 19th century. NgƒÅti Toa migrated from KƒÅwhia to the Cook Strait region under the leadership of their chief Te Rauparaha in the 1820s. Together, the two migrations Heke Tahutahuahi and Heke TƒÅtaramoa have the name Heke mai raro, meaning \\"migration from the north\\". The carved meeting-house bearing the name Te Heke Mai Raro, which stands on Hongoeka Marae, immortalises the migration.  First migration, Heke Tahutahuahi, 1820  Heke Tahutahuahi (translatable as the \\"fire lighting expedition\\") brought the NgƒÅti Toa iwi out of KƒÅwhia and into Taranaki in 1820. The Taranaki iwi NgƒÅti Mutunga presented NgƒÅti Toa with Pukewhakamaru PƒÅ, as well as with the cultivations nearby. Pukewhakamaru lay inland of ≈åkokƒ´, up the Urenui River. NgƒÅti Toa stayed at Pukewhakamaru for 12 months. The Waikato‚ÄìManiapoto alliance followed NgƒÅti Toa to Taranaki and battles ensued there, most notably the battle of Motunui between Waikato‚ÄìManiapoto and the NgƒÅti Tama, Te ƒÄti Awa and NgƒÅti Mutunga alliance.  Second migration, Heke TƒÅtaramoa, 1822‚Äì  The name Heke TƒÅtaramoa (translatable as the \\"bramble bush migration\\") commemorates the difficulties experienced during NgƒÅti Toa's second migration. NgƒÅti Toa left ≈åkokƒ´ around February‚ÄìMarch 1822 after harvesting crops planted for the journey. This heke also included some people from NgƒÅti Tama, NgƒÅti Mutunga and Te ƒÄti Awa. The heke arrived in the Horowhenua-Kapiti region in the early 1820s and settled first in Te Awamate, then at Te Wharangi, and then eventually on Kapiti Island.  \\"Ka Mate\\" haka  Concern over inappropriate commercial use of Te Rauparaha's Ka Mate led the iwi to attempt to trademark it ‚Äì but in 2006 the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand turned their claim down on the grounds that Ka Mate had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader. In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the New Zealand government agreed to: :...record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to NgƒÅti Toa and ... work with NgƒÅti Toa to address their concerns with the haka...

Regarded by many as the \\"Parliament of Canadian Jewry,\\" the Congress was at the forefront of the struggle for human rights, equality, immigration reform and civil rights in Canada. The organization disbanded in July 2011 following a reorganization of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, of which the CJA became a subsidiary in 2007. History =Founding and early history= Jewish calendar for the Canadian Armed Forces in World War II, published by the Canadian Jewish Congress The immediate predecessor to the CJC was formed in 1915 by the Montreal chapter of Poalei Zion, a working class Labour Zionist organization. They were soon joined by thirteen other organizations, mostly other chapters of Poalei Zion and the Arbeiter Ring, in forming the Canadian Jewish Alliance. The organization, composed of elected officials, set out to represent all of Canadian Jewry on its major political, national and international affairs. It also aimed to respond to problems arising from the First World War, specifically the oppression of Jews overseas, the immigration of Jewish refugees, and Britain's promises to create a Jewish state. In 1919, over 25,000 Jews from across Canada voted for delegates to the first convention of the CJC held in Montreal that March. Groups including the Canadian Federation of Zionist Societies, Poalei Zion, Mizrachi, and the Arbeiter Ring were present at the convention. While there, they were addressed by the Solicitor General of Canada, and were entertained at Montreal City Hall, where a large Zionist flag was draped over the Mayor's chair. The main decision at that meeting was the founding of the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society to assist Jewish settlers and refugees in Canada. They also passed motions expressing the Jewish community's loyalty to Canada and others declaring their support for the Balfour Declaration. The convention elected Lyon Cohen, former President of the Montreal Clothing Manufacturers Union, as their President. Despite this auspicious start, the CJC fell into abeyance and was inactive until 1934, due to lack of leadership and funding. With the rise in anti-Semitism and restricted immigration policies in the 1930s, the CJC re-convened in 1934 and held the Congress' second plenum in Toronto in January. Cohen's friend and close colleague, Samuel William Jacobs, a prominent Jewish leader and Member of Parliament, became the revived Congress' first president. In 1938, the Canadian Jewish Congress partnered with B'nai Brith Canada to create the Joint Public Relations Committee, with the goal of developing a strategy to combat discrimination and find allies within other minority groups. =Post‚ÄìWorld War II= Meeting of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1946 The CJC was active before and during World War II in lobbying the government (with limited success) to open the borders to Jewish refugees fleeing Europe. After the war, over 1,100 child Holocaust survivors immigrated to Canada in the War Orphans Project, a refugee resettlement program administered by the CJC. The CJC also organized relief aid for Holocaust survivors who were being detained in Displaced Persons camps. Along with the efforts of Senator Arthur Roebuck and Rabbi Avraham Aharon Price, the CJC helped obtain the release of young, Jewish refugees from internment camps, bringing them to study in Toronto. The Congress' dominant figure from 1939 to 1962 was its president, Samuel Bronfman who was elected president following Jacobs' death in 1938. During the Cold War at Bronfman's urging, the CJC expelled the United Jewish People's Order and other communist Jewish organizations in 1951. At the time, the UJPO was one of the largest Jewish fraternal organizations in Canada. It would not be readmitted to the CJC until 1995. In 1967, the CJC gifted approximately 7,000 volumes of rare Judaica to the National Library on behalf of the Canadian Jewish community in honour of the Canadian Centennial. During the war between Israel and Lebanon in 1982, former Prime Minister Joe Clark issued a public rebuke to the CJC at its annual policy convention for its stance of unconditionally supporting the State of Israel in that war. During the speech, Clark was interrupted with heckles from the crowd and approximately 50 people left the room in protest. Near the end of his remarks, the audience began to sing Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem. One of the initiatives sponsored by the CJC was the International Jewish Correspondence, founded in 1978, whose goal was to link Jews around the world as pen-pals. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, IJC became less active and had folded by 2002. The organization also provided addresses for Jews living in Arab and Soviet Bloc countries as well as Jewish prisoners who were put in contact with others in the same situation. Jewish people from nearly 20 countries participated in the initiative, including those with declining Jewish populations such as Estonia, Morocco and Zimbabwe. =Later history and disbandment= In its later decades the CJC launched campaigns to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration, to pressure the Canadian government to prosecute Nazi war criminals who had settled in Canada, and to enact and use hate crimes legislation against anti-Semites and Holocaust deniers such as Ernst Z√ºndel. The CJC was actively opposed to Quebec separatism in the 1990s, and formed a national coalition of Canada's Italian, Greek and Jewish communities during the debate on the Charlottetown Accord. The CJC also worked to promote tolerance and understanding between religious and ethnic groups, promote anti- racist work and other campaigns. The CJC introduced significant changes to its internal organization in June 2007. The previous system of electing representatives to the Board of Directors was discarded, and a new system was introduced wherein Board members were chosen by indirect elections from \\"regional Congress representatives\\" and \\"delegates from Jewish federations\\". Congress CEO Bernie Farber supported the change, arguing that it would streamline a complicated process. Others argued that the new system would give disproportionate power to the Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy. One individual, described by The Canadian Jewish News as a \\"close observer of Congress\\", argued that CIJA was \\"stacking the deck\\" in a bid to take over the CJC. In 2011, the renamed Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) assumed the functions of the CJC after an 18-month restructuring process in which the functions of the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Canada-Israel Committee, the Quebec-Israel Committee, National Jewish Campus Life and the University Outreach Committee were consolidated, a move that left the Jewish community divided. On 1 July 2011 the CJC posted a message on its website declaring that it had halted its activities and that its functions would be assumed by CIJA.

Career He won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1861. Between 1855 and 1898, he exhibited 72 portraits in the Paris Salon. Many of his paintings are single figures of beautiful women. Among his best portraits were those of M. L. Reynaud and the Prince Imperial (1874). In 1891, he became a member of the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. He was professor at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. Lefebvre is chiefly important as an excellent and sympathetic teacher who numbered many Americans among his 1500 or more pupils.

He also made other characters such as \\"El Raton Crispin\\" (Crispin The Mouse) in which he dressed as a big fat rat from Veracruz. His typical line was, Te odio con odio Jarocho, which means \\"I hate you with Jarocho (meaning from Veracruz) hatred\\". El Indio Maclovio and Juan Penas were also two very famous characters he acted out on several shows. His most famous TV program was El Mundo De Luis de Alba, (The World Of Luis de Alba), where El Pirrurris and other characters regularly appeared. After this program was canceled he spent many years away from television but retransmissions of the show were popular. In 2004 he came back portraying the Pirrurris once again in one of Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo's adult-oriented comedy shows, set in a primary school where the students are played by adult actors. In 2005 he got a new show where he plays the Pirrurris as well as his other characters. He is currently appearing in a show called \\"Los Chuperamigos\\" in Estrella TV with other actors such as \\"La Chupitos\\". Characters =El Pirrurris= Created sometime in the 1970s, the character is a very rich young man with a haircut similar to that used by the Beatles in their early years and depicts sarcastically and exaggeratedly the stereotype of a so-called \\"fresa\\". He enjoys deprecating low- to middle-class people with illusions of grandeur, airs of importance, bad taste, and colorful (low class) slang, while at the same time emphasizing his own importance and class-superiority, using a lot of \\"high class\\" slang. The people he deprecates are pejoratively called nacos. Pirrurris refined the ridicule of nacos into nacology, the study of the naco. Sitting behind a desk, he would explain the naco to his audience in scientific terms. So viewers would not take his remarks seriously, the character's locution and mannerisms are a parody of the so-called juniors, the pompous young sons of upper-class Mexicans, known for their tendency to dismiss anyone else as a naco. He frequently refers to his millionaire Papi and expresses amazement at the most mundane problems faced by normal people. Incredibly narcissistic, he explains that his name comes from the mathematical constant Pi and rorro (slang for handsome), in that he is \\"3.1416 times handsome\\". Pirrurris has become a common Mexican epithet for someone who looks down on others, is a materialist and superficial but however non-intelligent and air- headed (although not aware of this), and act as if one were above one's real economic station. Mexican leftist politician Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador has used the term on different occasions to refer to his right-wing political opponents. Luis de Alba started his artistic life when he was a child playing a character named \\"Solin\\". Solin was the always companion of a supposed man with gifted powers (Kaliman). Kaliman was the name of a daytime radio drama transmitted to his audience exclusively by radio in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Trivia In 1980, El Mundo de Luis de Alba became one of the first Televisa television series to use electronic graphics in its credits, as one of Mexico's first character generators was installed at Televisa San Angel, where the program as taped. The program's early-1980s opening titles were among the first in Mexico to utilize this technology.

The triad is a rhetorical form whereby objects are grouped together in threes, with a heading indicating the point of likeness; for example, \\"Three things not easily restrained, the flow of a torrent, the flight of an arrow, and the tongue of a fool.\\" Contents The texts include references to King Arthur and other semi-historical characters from Sub-Roman Britain, mythic figures such as Br√¢n the Blessed, undeniably historical personages such as Alan IV, Duke of Brittany (who is called Alan Fyrgan) and Iron Age characters such as Caswallawn (Cassivellaunus) and Caradoc (Caratacus). Some triads simply give a list of three characters with something in common (such as \\"the three frivolous bards of the island of Britain\\") while others include substantial narrative explanation. The triad form probably originated amongst the Welsh bards or poets as a mnemonic aid in composing their poems and stories, and later became a rhetorical device of Welsh literature. The Medieval Welsh tale Culhwch and Olwen has many triads embedded in its narrative. =Examples= As edited and translated by Rachel Bromwich, two characteristic examples of the Welsh triads are: > 36\\\\.

Earliest surviving collection The earliest surviving collection of the Welsh Triads is bound in the manuscript Peniarth 16, now at the National Library of Wales, which has been dated to the third quarter of the 13th century and contains 46 of the 96 triads collated by Rachel Bromwich. Other important manuscripts include Peniarth 45 (written about 1275), and the pair White Book of Rhydderch (Welsh: Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch) and Red Book of Hergest (Welsh: Llyfr Coch Hergest), which share a common version clearly different from the version behind the collections in the Peniarth manuscripts. Later collections The 18th century Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg compiled a collection of triads, which he claimed to have taken from his own collection of manuscripts. Some of his triads are similar to those found in the medieval manuscripts, but some are unique to Morganwg, and are widely believed to have been of his own invention.

It is often used as an extreme form of protest or in acts of martyrdom. It has a centuries-long recognition as the most extreme form of protest possible by humankind. Etymology The English word immolation originally meant (1534) \\"killing a sacrificial victim; sacrifice\\" and came to figuratively mean (1690) \\"destruction, especially by fire.\\" Its etymology was from Latin immolare \\"to sprinkle with sacrificial meal (mola salsa); to sacrifice\\" in ancient Roman religion. Self-immolation \\"setting oneself on fire, especially as a form of protest\\" was first recorded in Lady Morgan's France (1817).The Oxford English Dictionary, 2009, 2nd ed., v. 4.0, Oxford University Press.immolate, Oxford Dictionaries. History The self-immolation (jauhar) of the Rajput women, during the Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568 See: List of political self-immolations Self-immolation is tolerated by some elements of Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism, and it has been practiced for many centuries, especially in India, for various reasons, including jauhar, political protest, devotion, and renouncement. A historical example includes the practice of Sati when the Hindu goddess of the same name (see also Daksayani) legendarily set herself on fire after her father insulted her. Certain warrior cultures, such as those of the Charans and Rajputs, also practiced self-immolation. The act of sacrificing one's own body, though not by fire, is a component of two well-known stories found in the ancient Buddhist text known as the Jataka Tales, which, according to Buddhist tradition, gives accounts of past incarnations of the Buddha. In the \\"Hungry Tigress\\" Jataka, Prince Sattva looked down from a cliff and saw a starving tigress that was going to eat her newborn cubs, and compassionately sacrificed his body in order to feed the tigers and spare their lives. In the \\"Sibi Jataka\\", King ≈öibi, or Shibi, was renowned for selflessness, and the gods ≈öakra and Vishvakarman tested him by transforming into a hawk and a dove. The dove fell on the king's lap while trying to escape the hawk, and sought refuge. Rather than surrender the dove, ≈öibi offered his own flesh equivalent in weight to the dove, and the hawk agreed. They had rigged the balance scale, and King ≈öibi continued cutting off his flesh until half his body was gone, when the gods revealed themselves, restored his body, and blessed him. The Bodhisattva \\"Medicine King\\" (Bhaishajyaraja) chapter of the Lotus Sutra was associated with auto-cremation. In a previous life, 'Medicine King' Bodhisattva burnt his body as a supreme offering to the Buddha. The Lotus Sutra describes the Bodhisattva Sarvarupasamdarsana drinking scented oils, wrapping his body in an oil-soaked cloth, and burning himself. His body flamed for 1,200 years, he was reincarnated, burned off his forearms for 72,000 years, which enabled many to achieve enlightenment, and his arms were miraculously restored.( Zarmanochegas was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius, met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch around 13 ACE and burnt himself to death in Athens shortly thereafter.Strabo, xv, 1, on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73).Dio Cassius, liv, 9; see also Halkias, Georgios \\"The Self-immolation of Kalanos and other Luminous Encounters among Greeks and Indian Buddhists in the Hellenistic world.\\" Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, Vol. VIII, 2015: 163‚Äì186 Self-immolation has a long history in Chinese Buddhism. The relevant terms are: wangshen \\"lose the body\\" or \\"forget the body\\", yishen \\"abandon the body\\", and sheshen \\"give up the body\\". Historian James A. Benn explains the semantic range of Chinese Buddhist self-immolation. > But \\"abandoning the body\\" also covers a broad range of more extreme acts > (not all of which necessarily result in death): feeding one's body to > insects; slicing off one's flesh; burning one's fingers or arms; burning > incense on the skin; starving, slicing, or drowning oneself; leaping from > cliffs or trees; feeding one's body to wild animals; self-mummification > (preparing for death so that the resulting corpse is impervious to decay); > and of course, auto-cremation.Benn, James A. (2007), Burning for the Buddha: > self-immolation in Chinese Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, 9‚Äì10. The monk Fayu Ê≥ïÁæΩ (d. 396) carried out the earliest recorded Chinese self- immolation.Benn (2007), 33‚Äì34. He first informed the \\"illegitimate\\" prince Yao Xu ÂßöÁ∑í‚Äîbrother of Yao Chang who founded the non-Chinese Qiang state Later Qin (384‚Äì417)‚Äîthat he intended to burn himself alive. Yao tried to dissuade Fayu, but he publicly swallowed incense chips, wrapped his body in oiled cloth, and chanted while setting fire to himself. The religious and lay witnesses were described as being \\"full of grief and admiration.\\" Following Fayu's example, many Buddhist monks and nuns have used self-immolation for political purposes. Based upon analysis of Chinese historical records from the 4th to the 20th centuries, some monks did offer their bodies in periods of relative prosperity and peace, but there is a \\"marked coincidence\\" between acts of self-immolation and times of crisis, especially when secular powers were hostile towards Buddhism.(2007), 199. For example, Daoxuan's (c. 667) Xu Gaoseng Zhuan(Á∫åÈ´òÂÉßÂÇ≥, or Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks) records five monastics who self- immolated on the Zhongnan Mountains in response to the 574‚Äì577 persecution of Buddhism by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (known as the \\"Second Disaster of Wu\\").Benn (2007), 80‚Äì82. While self-immolation practices in China were based upon Indian Buddhist traditions, they acquired some distinctively Chinese aspects. An \\"unburned tongue\\" (cf. Anthony of Padua), which supposedly remained pink and moist owing to self-immolation while chanting the Lotus Sutra, was based on the belief in ≈öarƒ´ra \\"Buddhist relics; purportedly from a master's remains after cremation\\".Benn (2007), 144‚Äì147. \\"Burning off fingers\\" was a kind of gradual self-immolation, often in commemoration of relics or textual recitations. The Tang Dynasty monk Wuran ÁÑ°Êüì (d. c. 840) had a spiritual vision in which Manjusri told him to support the Buddhist community on Mount Wutai. After organizing meals for one million monks, Wuran burned off a finger in sacrifice, and eventually after ten million meals, had burned off all his fingers.Benn (2007), 135‚Äì36. Xichen ÊÅØÂ°µ (d. c. 937; with two fingers left) became a favorite of Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin for practicing finger burning to memorialize sutra recitations.Benn (2007), 149‚Äì150. \\"Buddhist mummies\\" refers to monks and nuns who practiced self-mummification through extreme self-mortification, for instance, Daoxiu ÈÅì‰ºë (d. 629).Benn (2007), 97. \\"Spontaneous human combustion\\" was a rare form of self-immolation that Buddhists associated with samƒÅdhi \\"consciously leaving one's body at the time of enlightenment\\". The monk Ningyi ÂØßÁæ© (d. 1583) stacked up firewood to burn himself, but, \\"As soon the torch was raised, his body started to burn 'like a rotten root' and was soon completely consumed. A wise person declared, 'He has entered the fiery samƒÅdhi.\\" Benn (2007), 179. A Hindu widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband (sati), 1657 For many monks and laypeople in Chinese history, self-immolation was a form of Buddhist practice that modeled and expressed a particular path that led towards Buddhahood. Historian Jimmy Yu has stated that self-immolation cannot be interpreted based on Buddhist doctrine and beliefs alone but the practice must be understood in the larger context of the Chinese religious landscape. He examines many primary sources from the 16th and 17th century and demonstrates that bodily practices of self- harm, including self-immolation, was ritually performed not only by Buddhists but also by Daoists and literati officials who either exposed their naked body to the sun in a prolonged period of time as a form of self-sacrifice or burned themselves as a method of procuring rain.Yu, Jimmy (2012), Sanctity and Self- Inflicted Violence in Chinese Religions, 1500‚Äì1700, Oxford University Press, 115‚Äì130. In other words, self-immolation was a sanctioned part of Chinese culture that was public, scripted, and intelligible both to the person doing the act and to those who viewed and interpreted it, regardless of their various religion affiliations. The Japanese ritual suicide seppuku (also called harakiri ‚Äî ritual disembowelment) is another example of \\"self- immolation\\". During the Great Schism of the Russian Church, entire villages of Old Believers burned themselves to death in an act known as \\"fire baptism\\" (self-burners: soshigateli). Scattered instances of self-immolation have also been recorded by the Jesuit priests of France in the early 17th century. However, their practice of this was not intended to be fatal: they would burn certain parts of their bodies (limbs such as the forearm or the thigh) to symbolise the pain Jesus endured while upon the cross. A 1973 study by a prison doctor suggested that people who choose self-immolation as a form of suicide are more likely to be in a \\"disturbed state of consciousness\\", such as epilepsy. Political protest Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c's self-immolation during the Buddhist crisis The Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam saw the persecution of the country's majority religion under the administration of Catholic president Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. Several Buddhist monks, including the most famous case of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c, immolated themselves by fire in protest. An important source of inspiration for the monks and nuns who self-immolated is the twenty-third chapter of the Lotus Sutra which recounts the life story of Bodhisattva Medicine King. In this section of the Sutra, Medicine King demonstrates his insight into ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ and the selfless nature of all things by ritualistically setting his own body aflame, which burned for 1,200 years to demonstrate the immeasurable power of the Buddhadharma. Thich Nhat Hanh adds: \\"The bodhisattva shone his light about him so that everyone could see as he could see, giving them the opportunity to see the deathless nature of the ultimate.\\"Nh√°ÃÇt H·∫°nh. (2003). Opening the heart of the cosmos: Insights on the Lotus Sutra. Berkeley, CA: Parallax Press. p. 144. The widespread coverage of the self- immolations of the Buddhist monks in mid-20th-century Western media established the practice as a type of a political protest in the Western mind. Self-immolations are often public and political events that catch the attention of the news media through their dramatic means. They are seen as a type of altruistic suicide for a collective cause, and are not intended to inflict physical harm on others or cause material damage. They attract attention to a cause and those who undergo the act are glorified in martyrdom. Fire immolation does not guarantee death for the burned. The example set by self-immolators in the mid 20th century did spark numerous similar acts between 1963 and 1971, most of which occurred in Asia and the United States in conjunction with protests opposing the Vietnam War. Researchers counted almost 100 self-immolations covered by The New York Times and The Times. In 1968 the practice spread to the Soviet bloc with the self-immolation of Polish accountant and Armia Krajowa veteran Ryszard Siwiec, as well as those of two Czech students, Jan Palach and Jan Zaj√≠c, and of toolmaker Ev≈æen Plocek, in protest against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. As a protest against Soviet rule in Lithuania, 19-year-old Romas Kalanta set himself on fire in Kaunas. In 1978 Ukrainian dissident and former political prisoner Oleksa Hirnyk burnt himself near the tomb of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko protesting against the russification of Ukraine under Soviet rule. The practice continues, notably in India: as many as 1,451 and 1,584 self- immolations were reported there in 2000 and 2001, respectively. A particularly high wave of self-immolation in India was recorded in 1990 protesting the Reservation in India. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of self-immolations in India to date. In Iran, most self-immolations have been performed by citizens protesting the tempestuous changes brought upon after the Iranian Revolution. Many of which have gone largely unreported by regime authority, but have been discussed and documented by established witnesses. Provinces that were involved more intensively in postwar problems feature higher rates of self- immolation. These undocumented demonstrations of protest are deliberated upon worldwide, by professionals such as Iranian historians who appear on international broadcasts such as Voice of America, and use the immolations as propaganda to direct criticism towards the Censorship in Iran. One specifically well documented self-immolation transpired in 1993, 14 years after the revolution, and was performed by Homa Darabi, a self-proclaimed political activist affiliated with the Nation Party of Iran. Darabi is known for her political self-immolation in protest to the compulsory hijab. Self- immolation protests continue to take place against the regime to this day. Most recently accounted for is the September 2019 Death of Sahar Khodayari, protesting a possible sentence of six months in prison for having tried to enter a public stadium to watch a football game, against the national ban against women at such events. One month after her death, Iranian women were allowed to attend a soccer match in Iran for the first time in 40 years. Since 2009, there have been, as of June 2017, 148 confirmed and two disputed self- immolations by Tibetans, with most of these protests (some 80%) ending in death. The Dalai Lama has said he does not encourage the protests, but he has spoken with respect and compassion for those who engage in self-immolation. The Chinese government, however, claims that he and the exiled Tibetan government are inciting these acts. In 2013, the Dalai Lama questioned the effectiveness of self-immolation as a demonstration tactic. He has also expressed that the Tibetans are acting of their own free will and stated that he is powerless to influence them to stop carrying out immolation as a form of protest. A wave of self-immolation suicides occurred in conjunction with the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa, with at least 14 recorded incidents. These suicides assisted in inciting the Arab Spring, including the 2010‚Äì2011 Tunisian revolution, the main catalyst of which was the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, the 2011 Algerian protests (including many self-immolations in Algeria), and the 2011 Egyptian revolution. There have also been suicide protests in Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, and Syria.

It is also a byproduct of doenjang production. Both lighter in colour and saltier than other Korean ganjang varieties, soup soy sauce is used mainly in guk (soup) and namul (a seasoned vegetable dish) in modern Korean cuisine.  Names  Soup soy sauce is referred to by many different names. In the English-speaking world, it is most commonly known as \\"soup soy sauce\\", which is a direct translation of guk-ganjang (). The name \\"soup soy sauce\\" is used because it is used mainly for soup (guk) in modern Korean cuisine. Also, it is the name used by many popular soy sauce brands such as Sempio, Daesang's Chung Jung One, and CJ Cheil Jedang's Beksul. Other names for the sauce include: * Hansik ganjang () ‚Äì \\"Korean-style soy sauce\\" is a name used by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. * Jaeraesik ganjang () ‚Äì \\"traditional soy sauce\\" is a name used for soup soy sauce when compared to gaeryang ganjang (, \\"modernized soy sauce\\"), which is now the most widely used (and considered \\"regular\\") type of soy sauce in modern Korean cuisine. * Joseon-ganjang () ‚Äì \\"Joseon soy sauce\\" is a name used for soup soy sauce, when compared to Wae-ganjang (, \\"Wae soy sauce\\"). The term \\"Wae soy sauce\\" is used to refer to modernized gaeryang ganjang, which was introduced to Korea during the era of Japanese forced occupation. * Jip-ganjang () ‚Äì \\"home soy sauce\\" is a name used for home-brewed soup soy sauce.  History  The earliest soy sauce brewing in Korea seems to have begun prior to the era of the Three Kingdoms. The Records of the Three Kingdoms, a Chinese historical text written and published in the 3rd century, mentions that \\"Goguryeo people are good at brewing fermented soy beans\\", in the section called Dongyi (Eastern foreigners), in the Book of Wei. Jangdoks used for soy sauce brewing are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No. 3 from 4th century Goguryeo. In Samguk Sagi, a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is mentioned that ganjang and doenjang along with meju and jeotgal were prepared for the wedding ceremony of King Sinmun in February 683. Sikhwaji, a section from Goryeosa (History of Goryeo), recorded that ganjang and doenjang were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as Guhwangchwaryo and Jeungbo sallim gyeongje contain detailed procedures on how to brew good-quality ganjang and doenjang. Gyuhap chongseo explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve ganjang and doenjang.  Production  Traditional Korean soy sauce Soup soy sauce is made entirely of fermented soybeans and brine. The brewing process also produces doenjang, a Korean fermented bean paste. Meju, Korean soybean brick, is made around ipdong in early November. Soybeans are soaked overnight, boiled in salt water, and then pounded in a mortar (jeolgu) or coarsely ground with a millstone. About a doe (‚âà1.8 litres) or two of pounded soybeans are chunked, compressed, and shaped into a cube or a sphere called meju. The meju bricks are then dried in a cool, shaded area for a week to several weeks until firm. When the bricks harden, they are tied with rice straws to the eaves of the house, or put in a warm ondol room with rice straw, to ferment. In Jeongwol, the first month of the lunar year, well-fermented meju bricks are washed and sun-dried. After drying, the meju bricks are aged in onggi crocks (jangdok) with brine. Charcoal and chillies are added for their adsorbent and antibacterial properties, as well as folk-religious beliefs that they drive away evil spirits. As the fermentation progresses, the brine acquires flavour and colour. This aged brine is boiled to become soy sauce, and the rest (aged meju chunks) is mashed to become soybean paste.  Types  The Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies hansik ganjang into two categories by their ingredients: * Jaerae-hansik-ganjang (, \\"traditional Korean-style soy sauce\\") ‚Äì soy sauce made with traditional style meju and brine. * Gaeryang-hansik-ganjang (, \\"modernized Korean-style soy sauce\\") ‚Äì soy sauce made with non-traditional meju (which can be made of regular soybean, rice, barley, wheat, or degreased soybean, and ripened using traditional method or aspergillus) and saline solution. Depending on the length of aging, hansik ganjang can be divided into three main varieties: clear, middle, and dark. * Haet-ganjang (, \\"new soy sauce\\") ‚Äì soy sauce aged for a year. Also called cheongjang (, \\"clear soy sauce\\"). * Jung-ganjang (, \\"middle soy sauce\\") ‚Äì soy sauce aged for three to four years. * Jin-ganjang (, \\"dark soy sauce\\") ‚Äì soy sauce aged for more than five years. Also called jinjang (, \\"aged soy sauce\\"), nongjang (, \\"thick soy sauce\\"), or jingamjang (, \\"aged mature soy sauce\\").

The Ted Bates agency, where he rose to chairman, exists today as Bates CHI & Partners. Early life and start in advertising Reeves was born in Virginia to a Methodist preacher, and briefly attended the University of Virginia until he was expelled for drunkenly crashing a friend's car during the Prohibition era. Luckily, he had just won one hundred dollars as a prize for a state-wide chemistry contest that served as his final exam for first year Chem 101. While other students wrote novel chemical formulae as their submission, Reeves, by virtue of not knowing anything about chemistry having spent the semester drinking, dancing and gambling, blithely submitted an essay titled \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\". He would later use this title for DuPont Corporation campaign. The one hundred dollars was enough money to move to Richmond where he was hired at a new bank that was hiring young contest winners. Finding that he was a poor accountant but verbally gifted, he began writing advertisements. He soon moved to New York City to found Ted Bates & Co with Ted Bates. Advertising style Reeves believed the purpose of advertising is to sell. He insisted that an advertisement or commercial should show off the value or unique selling proposition, (or USP) of a product, not the cleverness or humor of a copywriter. His most typical ad is probably that for Anacin, a headache medicine. The ad was considered grating and annoying by almost all viewers but it was remarkably successful, tripling the product's sales. In 7 years the 59-second commercial made more money than the movie Gone With The Wind had in a quarter-century. His ads were focused around what he coined the unique selling proposition, the one reason the product needed to be bought or was better than its competitors. These often took the form of slogans ‚Äî Reeves oversaw the introduction of dozens, some that still exist to this day, such as M&M;'s \\"melts in your mouth, not in your hand.\\" He argued that advertising campaigns should be unchanging with a single slogan for each product. His commercials for Bic pens, Minute Maid orange juice, M&M;'s candies, Colgate toothpaste and other products used similar methods, often making dramatic demonstrations. Reeves pointed out that to work, advertising had to be honest. He insisted the product being sold actually be superior, and argued that no amount of advertising could move inferior goods. He also disagreed that advertising was able to create demand where it did not exist. Successful advertising for a flawed product would only increase the number of people who tried the product and became dissatisfied with it. If advertising is effective enough and a product flawed enough, the advertising will accelerate the destruction of the brand. Similarly, Reeves believed it was a waste of money to claim uniqueness that doesn't exist, because consumers will soon find out, and they won't come back to the brand. This is important because historically fortunes are made from repeat business. Money would be better spent building some kind of meaningful advantage into a product before launching a costly advertising campaign to promote it. Reeves advised clients to be wary of brand image advertising which is less likely to be successful than his claim-based strategy. This is because when communication relies on an image, the claim is not articulated. An image can almost always be interpreted different ways, many if not most of which won't do a product any good. The message that a viewer takes away from an image is often very different from what the advertiser had intended. Or to put it another way: practically every product has a number of benefits that might be claimed. Commonly one of the benefits is more popular than the others, even more popular than the others combined. Therefore, it's imperative to do everything to make people understand the most important benefit, to achieve credibility and to avoid distractions. The aim is to have as high a percentage of people as possible take out of an advertisement what the advertiser intends to put into it. This is most likely to be achieved if a claim is articulated and proven with credible evidence‚Äîin a brief commercial, some kind of dramatic demonstration. Reeves is also notable for creating Dwight Eisenhower's presidential ads for the 1952 election. He packaged Eisenhower as a forthright, strong, yet friendly leader. The commercials all included a regular person asking a question to the upper right of the screen. They would cut to Eisenhower, not wearing glasses to look stronger, looking to the lower left and then turning to the camera and responding. They were created by letting Eisenhower speak for a number of hours. Then questions were crafted later that best fit his answers. Later Years In the 1960s Reeves' techniques began to fail. Consumers became more savvy and learned to tune out uninteresting commercials, and within the advertising industry itself the Creative Revolution, exemplified by Doyle Dane Bernbach's \\"Think Small\\" campaign for the Volkswagen Beetle. The Creative Revolution rejected many of his precepts though some might argue that the \\"Think Small\\" does conform to the rules set out in Reeves' book Reality in Advertising because it highlights what is most unusual about the Beetle, namely its small size and distinct shape. Reeves retired at age 55. He declared that he had always planned to retire at that age, but many of his competitors felt it was because of the decline in his influence. He came out of retirement in 1967 to form the Tiderock Corporation, which he described as a \\"think tank\\" for corporate business. One of its projects was a promotion in 1968 of a pro-smoking article by Stanley Frank published in True magazine. The promotion was paid for by the Tobacco Institute, who also paid Frank to write the article. This was common practice among advertising men of the time and wholly unremarkable from the perspective of 1960's business ethics. Reeves died of a heart attack on January 24, 1984 at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He was 73 years old. Published works Reeves expressed his views in his 1961 book, Reality in Advertising (Knopf) which is still taught at Harvard Business School. An interview with Reeves was included in The Art of Writing Advertising (1965). His greatest contributions were to express more clearly than anyone else the philosophy of a claim and to show how the philosophy could be applied to commercials that involve severe time constraints. Reeves wrote a well received novel, Popo (Knopf) about a poet who leaves a life of material wealth to move to Greenwich Village in New York City, to pursue his poetry. Reeves co- authored The 99 Critical Shots in Pool with Ray Martin to explain both Euclid and Sir Isaac Newtons' geometric proofs. Rosser Reeves' poem E=MC2 appeared in \\"The Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction, Tenth Series\\" in 1961. The editors commented: > \\"The author is chairman of the board of a large corporation, and we confess > we find it intriguing and comforting to know that a man whose workday is > devoted to the harsh realities of multi-million-dollar profit and loss has > in him that good old-fashioned sense of wonder.\\" References Further reading *Johnston, Laurie (January 25, 1984).

It is a luminous blue variable and one of the most luminous stars known, having a luminosity varying widely above and below 1,000,000 times the luminosity of the Sun, but so far away that it is invisible to the naked eye. History S Doradus was noted in 1897 as an unusual and variable star, of Secchi type I with bright lines of HŒ±, HŒ≤, and HŒ≥. The formal recognition as a variable star came the assignment of the name S Doradus in 1904 in the Second supplement to Catalogue of Variable Stars. S Dor was observed many times over the coming decades. In 1924, it was described as \\"P Cygni class\\" and recorded at photographic magnitude 9.5 In 1925, its absolute magnitude was estimated at ‚àí8.9. In 1933 it was listed as a 9th magnitude Beq star with bright hydrogen lines. It was the most luminous star known at that time. In 1943, the variability was interpreted as being due to eclipses of a binary companion, orbiting with a period of 40 years. This was refuted in 1956, when the variability was described as irregular and the spectrum as A0 with P Cygni profiles and emission for many spectral lines. The brightness was observed to decline by 0.8 magnitudes from 1954 into 1955. At the same time, S Doradus was noted as being similar to the Hubble‚ÄìSandage variables, the LBVs discovered in M31 and M33. The brief 1955 minimum was followed by a deep minimum in 1964, when the spectrum was compared to Eta Carinae in strong contrast to the mid-A spectrum at normal brightness. By 1969 the nature of S Doradus was still uncertain, considered possibly to be a pre-main-sequence star, but during the next decade the consensus settled on the S Doradus type variables and Hubble-Sandage variables being evolved massive supergiants. They were eventually given the name \\"luminous blue variables\\" in 1984, coined in part because of the similarity of the acronym LBV to the well-defined LPV class of variable stars. The classification system defined for the General Catalogue of Variable Stars pre-dated this and so the acronym SDOR is used for LBVs. Surroundings Large Magellanic Cloud. NGC 1910 is labelled near the centre of the image, and S Doradus is clearly visible at full size. (Credit: Robert Gendler/ESO) S Doradus is the brightest member of the open cluster NGC 1910, also known as the LH41 stellar association, visible in binoculars as a bright condensation within the main bar of the LMC. This is within the N119 emission nebula, which has a distinctive spiral shape. It is one of the visually brightest individual stars in the LMC, at some times the brightest. There are only a handful of other 9th magnitude stars in the LMC, such as the yellow hypergiant HD 33579. There are several compact clusters near S Doradus, within the general NGC 1910/LH41 association. The closest is less than four arc-minutes away, contains two out of the three WO stars in the entire LMC, and the entire cluster is about the same brightness as S Doradus. A little further away is NGC 1916. Another LBV, R85, is just two arc-minutes away. This rich star-forming region also hosts a third Wolf‚ÄìRayet star, at least 10 other supergiants, and at least 10 class O stars. S Doradus has a number of close companion stars. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists two 11th magnitude stars 5\\" away, which at the distance of the LMC is about four light years. A much closer companion has been found using the Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor, 1.7\\" away and four magnitudes fainter. There are other nearby stars, most notably a 12th magnitude OB supergiant at 13\\". Variability Light curve of S Doradus from 1987 to 2016, showing slow variations with a deep minimum in 2011 This star belongs to its own eponymous S Doradus class of variable stars, also designated as luminous blue variables or LBVs. LBVs exhibit long slow changes in brightness, punctuated by occasional outbursts. S Doradus is typically a magnitude 9 star, varying by a few tenths of a magnitude on timescales of a few months, superimposed on variations of about a magnitude taking several years. The extreme range of these variations is from about visual magnitude 8.6 ‚Äì 10.4. Every few decades it shows a more dramatic decrease in brightness, to as low as magnitude 11.5. The nature of the variation is somewhat unusual for an LBV; S Doradus is typically in an outburst state, with only occasional fades to the quiescent state that is typical of most stars in the class. Light curve of S Doradus from 2012 to 2016, showing the microvariations superimposed on a slow rise from the deep 2011 minimum The colour of S Doradus changes as its brightness varies, being bluest when the star is faintest. At the same time, the spectrum shows dramatic changes. It is typically an extreme mid A supergiant with P Cygni profiles on many lines (e.g. A5eq or A2/3Ia+e). At maximum brightness, the spectrum can become as cool as an F supergiant, with strong ionised metal lines and almost no emission components. At minimum brightness, the spectrum is dominated by emission, particularly forbidden lines of Fe but also helium and other metals. At the deep minima these features are even more pronounced, and Fe emission also appears. Attempts to identify regularity in the unpredictable changes of brightness suggest a period of around 100 days for the small amplitude variations near maximum brightness. At minimum brightness, these microvariations are considered to occur with periods as long as 195 days. The slower variations have been characterised with a period of 6.8 years, with an interval of 35‚Äì40 years between deep minima. The microvariations are similar to the brightness changes shown by Œ± Cygni variables, which are less luminous hot supergiants. The instability strip The S Doradus Instability strip and outburst region in the H‚ÄìR diagram, showing S Doradus at minimum and maximum under the assumption of constant luminosity S Doradus variables (LBVs) show distinct quiescent and outburst states. During the quiescent phase, LBVs lie along a diagonal band in the H‚ÄìR diagram called the S Doradus Instability Strip, with the more luminous examples having hotter temperatures. The standard theory is that LBV outbursts occur when the mass loss increases and an extremely dense stellar wind creates a pseudo-photosphere. The temperature drops until the wind opacity starts to decrease, meaning all LBV outbursts reach a temperature around 8,000‚Äì9,000 K. The bolometric luminosity during outbursts is considered to remain largely unchanged, but the visual luminosity increases as radiation shifts from the ultraviolet into the visual range. Detailed investigations have shown that some LBVs appear to change luminosity from minimum to maximum. S Doradus has been calculated to be less luminous at maximum brightness (minimum temperature), possibly as a result of potential energy going into expansion of a substantial portion of the star. AG Carinae and HR Carinae show similar luminosity decreases in some studies, but in the most convincing case AFGL 2298 increased its luminosity during its outbursts. Rare larger eruptions can appear as long-lasting under-luminous supernovae, and have been termed supernova impostors. The cause of the eruptions is unknown, but the star survives and may experience multiple eruptions. Eta Carinae and P Cygni are the only known examples in the Milky Way galaxy, and S Doradus has not shown such an eruption. Stellar properties thumbrightupright=1.4S Doradus properties at minimum and maximum according to different studies: \\\\- van Genderen (2001), temperature at minimum derived from colour index \\\\- Lamers (1995), properties derived from non-LTE model atmosphere \\\\- Humphreys & Davidson (1994), temperature at minimum assumes constant luminosity The temperature of an LBV is difficult to determine because the spectra are so peculiar and the standard colour calibrations don't apply, so the luminosity changes associated with brightness variations cannot be calculated accurately. Within the margins of error, it has often been assumed that the luminosity stays constant during all LBV outbursts. This is likely if the outburst consists only of an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo- photosphere to mimic a larger cooler star. Better atmospheric physics and observations of luminosity changes during some LBV outbursts have cast doubt on the original models. The atmosphere of S Doradus has been modelled in detail between a normal minimum at magnitude 10.2 in 1985 and a maximum at magnitude 9.0 in 1989. The temperature was calculated to drop from 20,000 K to 9,000 K, and the luminosity dropped from to . This corresponds to an increase in the radius of the visible surface of the star from to . A simpler calculation of the variation from the deep 1965 minimum at magnitude 11.5 to the 1989 maximum gives a temperature drop from 35,000 K to 8,500 K, and the luminosity drop from to . For a brief period during the maximum in late 1999, the temperature dropped further to between 7,500 K and 8,500 K, without the brightness changing noticeably. This is normal in other LBVs at maximum and is as cool as they can get, but it has not been seen in S Doradus before, or since. Observations of AG Carinae have shown that any luminosity changes between minimum and maximum may occur abruptly over a small temperature range, with the luminosity approximately constant during the rest of the light curve. The mass of an LBV is difficult to calculate directly unless it is in a binary system. The surface gravity changes dramatically and is difficult to measure from the peculiar spectral lines, and the radius is poorly defined. LBVs are thought to be the direct predecessors of Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, but may be either just evolved from the main sequence or post-red supergiant stars with much lower masses. In the case of S Doradus, the current mass is likely to be in the range of .

History CN Marine was created by parent Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1977 as a means to group the company's ferry operations in eastern Canada into a separate operating division. It had previously been part of the Canadian National Steamship Company. The majority of these ferries also required federal subsidies to supplement fares, thus CN was unwilling to have the operating losses appear in the railway's accounts. CN Marine also operated the Newfoundland Dockyard in St. John's, Newfoundland. CN Marine undertook several major service improvements on the constitutionally mandated services to Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island by commissioning the construction of the new vessels Abegweit and Caribou in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1986, the federal government approved a restructuring at CN which saw the company remove itself completely from the east coast ferry service, which was renamed Marine Atlantic. This move was in advance of CN abandoning railway services on the islands of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, which had required use of CN/CN Marine rail ferries. At the time of the changeover to Marine Atlantic, the last of the rail ferries to Newfoundland were retired, with that province's railway abandoned in September 1988; Prince Edward Island followed in December 1989. Marine Atlantic itself made many changes a decade later in 1997, virtually decimating the remnants of CN Marine by removing itself from all routes and vessels except the constitutionally mandated service to Port aux Basques and the seasonal service to Argentia, both originating in North Sydney. Also in 1997 Marine Atlantic sold off the Newfoundland Dockyard in St. John's to a private operator. It was renamed NewDock-The St. John's Dockyard Company.

In the Egyptian language it is known as ipet resyt, \\"the southern sanctuary\\". In Luxor there are several great temples on the east and west banks. Four of the major mortuary temples visited by early travelers include the Temple of Seti I at Gurnah, the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahri, the Temple of Ramesses II (i.e., Ramesseum), and the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu. The two primary cults' temples on the east bank are known as the Karnak and Luxor.Science, \\"Excavation of the Temple of Luxor,\\" Science, 6, no. 6 (1885): 370. Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo). To the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. During the Roman era, the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of the Roman government in the area. During the Roman period a chapel inside the Luxor Temple originally dedicated to the goddess Mut was transformed into a Tetrarchy cult chapel and later into a church. Construction two obelisks, as seen in 1832. The one on the right is now in Paris, known as the Luxor Obelisk. The Luxor Temple was built with sandstone from the Gebel el-Silsila area, which is located in South-Western Egypt.Bernd Fitzner, Kurt Heinrichs, and Dennis La Bouchardiere, \\"Weathering damage on Pharaonic sandstone monuments in Luxor-Egypt,\\" Building and Environment, 38 (2003): 1089. This sandstone is referred to as Nubian sandstone. It was used for the construction for monuments in Upper Egypt as well as in the course of past and current restoration works. Like other Egyptian structures, a common technique used was symbolism, or illusionism.Alexander Badawy, \\"Illusionism in Egyptian Architecture,\\" Studies in the Ancient Oriental Civilization, 35 (1969): 23. For example, to the Egyptian, a sanctuary shaped like an Anubis jackal was really Anubis. At the Luxor Temple, the two obelisks (the smaller one closer to the west is now at the Place de la Concorde in Paris) flanking the entrance were not the same height, but they created the illusion that they were. With the layout of the temple they appear to be of equal height, but using illusionism, it enhances the relative distances hence making them look the same size to the wall behind it. Symbolically, it is a visual and spatial effect to emphasize the heights and distance from the wall, enhancing the already existing pathway. Excavation From medieval times, the Muslim population of Luxor had settled in and around the temple, at the southward end of the mount. Due to the Luxor's past city population building on top of and around the Luxor temple, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some 14.5 to 15 metres (48‚Äì 50 ft) in height. The Luxor Temple had begun to be excavated by Professor Gaston Maspero after 1884, after he had been given permission to commence operations. The excavations were carried out sporadically until 1960. Over time, accumulated rubbish of the ages had buried three quarters of the temple which contained the courts and colonnades which formed the nucleus of the Arab half of the modern village. Maspero had taken an interest earlier, and he had taken over the post of Mariette Pasha to complete the job in 1881. Not only was there rubbish, but there were also barracks, stores, houses, huts, pigeon towers, which needed to be removed in order to excavate the site. (There still exists a working mosque within the temple which was never removed.) Maspero received from the Egyptian minister of public works the authorization needed to obtain funds in order to negotiate compensation for the pieces of land covered by the houses and dependencies. Festivals Statues of Ramses II near the Pylon of Luxor Temple The Luxor Temple was built during the New Kingdom and dedicated to the Theban Triad consisted of Amun, his consort Mut, and their son Khonsu. The focus of the annual Opet Festival, in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby Karnak Temple (ipet-sut) to stay there for a while with his consort Mut, was to promote the fertility of Amun-Re and the Pharaoh. However, other studies at the temple by the Epigraphic Survey team present a completely new interpretation of Luxor and its great annual festival (the Feast of Opet).Lanny Bell, \\"Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal Ka,\\" Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 44, no. 4 (1985): 251. They have concluded that Luxor is the temple dedicated to the divine Egyptian ruler or, more precisely, to the cult of the Royal Ka. Examples of the cult of the Royal Ka can be seen with the colossal seated figures of the deified Ramesses II before the Pylon and at the entrance to the Grand colonnade are clearly Ka-statues, cult statues of the king as embodiment of the royal Ka. Shrine stations Luxor dromos, an avenue of human headed sphinxes which once connected the temples of Karnak and Luxor. Six barque shrines, serving as way stations for the barques of the gods during festival processions, were set up on the avenue between the Karnak and Luxor Temple.Charles Nims, \\"Places about Thebes,\\" Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 14, no. 2 (1955): 114. The avenue which went in a straight line between the Luxor Temple and the Karnak area was lined with human-headed sphinxes; in ancient times it is probable that these replaced earlier sphinxes which may have had different heads. Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to temple. Each station had a purpose, for example the fourth station was the station of Kamare, which cooled the oar of Amun. The Fifth station of Kamare was the station which received the beauty of Amun. Lastly the Sixth Station of Kamare was a shrine for Amun, Holy of Steps. A small mudbrick shrine was built in the courtyard of Nectanebo I in early second century (126 CE) and was dedicated to Serapis and Isis; it was presented to Roman Emperor Hadrian on his birthday. The Abu Haggag Mosque seen from the east Abu Haggag Mosque The active Abu Haggag Mosque (Arabic: ŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ¨ÿßÿ¨ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÇÿµÿ±) is located within the temple, standing on the ancient columns themselves. That part of the Luxor Temple was converted to a church by the Romans in 395 AD, and then to a mosque in 640, more than 3400 years of continuous religious worship. Hence, the Luxor Temple is the oldest building in the world at least partially active for other than archeological or tourist purposes. Defacement In 2013, a Chinese student posted a picture of engraved graffiti that read \\"Ding Jinhao was here\\" () in Chinese on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other defacements. The engraving has since been partially cleared.

Although he viewed himself primarily as a novelist, he is now best known for his The Civil War: A Narrative, a three- volume history of the American Civil War. Mackowski, C (ed.) 2020, Entertaining History : The Civil War in Literature, Film, and Song, Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, p. 61 With geographic and cultural roots in the Mississippi Delta, Foote's life and writing paralleled the radical shift from the agrarian planter system of the Old South to the Civil Rights era of the New South. Foote was little known to the general public until his appearance in Ken Burns's PBS documentary The Civil War in 1990, where he introduced a generation of Americans to a war that he believed was \\"central to all our lives.\\" Foote did all his writing by hand with a nib pen, later transcribing the result into a typewritten copy. Early life Foote was born in Greenville, Mississippi, the son of Shelby Dade Foote and his wife Lillian (n√©e Rosenstock). Foote's paternal grandfather, Huger Lee Foote (1854‚Äì1915), a planter, had gambled away most of his fortune and assets. His paternal great-grandfather, Hezekiah William Foote (1813‚Äì99), was an American Confederate veteran, attorney, planter and state politician from Mississippi. His maternal grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Vienna. Foote was raised in his father's and maternal grandmother's Episcopal faith, though he attended synagogue each Saturday with his mother until the age of eleven. As his father advanced through the executive ranks of Armour and Company, the family lived in Greenville, Jackson, and Vicksburg, Mississippi, as well as Pensacola, Florida and Mobile, Alabama. Foote's father died in Mobile when Foote was five years old; he and his mother moved back to Greenville to live with her sister's family.The 1930 Federal Census shows Lillian and Shelby as living with Milton and Maude Moyse. Lillian is listed as Milton's sister-in-law. See lines 19 through 22 of page 6A of the 1930 Federal Census for District 7 of Greenville, Washington County, Mississippi. Foote was an only child, and his mother never remarried. When Foote was 15 years old, Walker Percy and his brothers LeRoy and Phinizy Percy moved to Greenville to live with their uncle ‚Äì attorney, poet, and novelist William Alexander Percy ‚Äì after the death of their parents. Foote began a lifelong fraternal and literary relationship with Walker; each had great influence on the other's writing. Other influences on Foote's writing were Tacitus, Thucydides, Gibbon and Proust.\\"Shelby Foote, Historian and Novelist, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, June 29, 2005 Foote would later recall that Greenville fitted with Southern stereotypes \\"in some fairly superficial ways and departed from them in the most important ways\\", noting that \\"There was never a lynching in Greenville; it never got swept off its feet that way. The Ku Klux Klan never made any headway, at a time when it was making headway almost everywhere else.\\"Tillinghast, Richard, and Shelby Foote. ‚ÄúAn Interview with Shelby Foote.‚Äù Ploughshares, vol. 9, no. 2/3, 1983, 120 Despite Foote's claim, however, Greenville was, in fact, the site of at least one lynching: in 1903 White citizens of Greenville lynched John Dennis, a Black man who was accused of raping a White woman. According to EJI, moreover, at least 13 lynchings, took place in Washington County, of which Greenville is the county seat, between 1877 and 1950.https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore Foote edited The Pica, the student newspaper of Greenville High School, and frequently used the paper to lampoon the school's principal. In 1935, Foote applied to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hoping to join with the older Percy boys, but was denied admission because of an unfavorable recommendation from his high school principal. He presented himself for admission anyway, and as result of a battery of admissions tests, he was accepted. In 1936 he was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Interested more in the process of learning than in earning a degree, Foote was not a model student. He often skipped class to explore the library, and once he even spent the night among the shelves. He also began contributing pieces of fiction to Carolina Magazine, UNC's award-winning literary journal. Foote returned to Greenville in 1937, where he worked in construction and for a local newspaper, The Delta Democrat Times. Around this time, he began to work on his first novel. Foote's Jewish heritage led him to experience discrimination at Chapel Hill, an experience that led to his later support for the Civil Rights Movement.Timothy S. Huebner, Madeleine M. McGrady. \\"Shelby Foote, Memphis, and the Civil War in American Memory\\". 17 In 1940 Foote joined the Mississippi National Guard and was commissioned as captain of artillery. After being transferred from one stateside base to another, his battalion was deployed to Northern Ireland in 1943. The following year, Foote was charged with falsifying a government document relating to the check-in of a motor pool vehicle he had borrowed to visit a girlfriend in Belfast, Teresa Lavery‚Äîlater his first wife‚Äîwho lived two miles beyond the official military limits. He was court-martialed and dismissed from the army. Shelby and Teresa divorced while she was living with his mother in New Orleans, after Shelby sent her to the U.S. on a warship convoy. After the war, Teresa married Kermit Beahan, the Nagasaki atomic bomb bombardier, in Roswell, New Mexico. Foote came back to the United States and took a job with the Associated Press in New York City. In January 1945, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but was discharged as a private in November 1945, never having seen combat. During his training with the Marines, he recalled a fellow Marine asking him, \\"You used to be a[n] Army captain, didn't you?\\" When Foote said yes, the fellow replied, \\"You ought to make a pretty good Marine private.\\" Foote returned to Greenville and took a job with a local radio station, but he spent most of his time writing. He sent a section from his first novel to The Saturday Evening Post. \\"Flood Burial\\" was published in 1946, and when Foote received a $750 check from the Post as payment, he quit his job to write full-time. Novelist Foote's first novel, Tournament, was published in 1949. It was inspired by his planter grandfather, who had died two years before Foote's birth. For his next novel, Follow Me Down (1950), Foote drew heavily from the proceedings of a Greenville murder trial he attended in 1941 for both the plot and characters. Love in a Dry Season was his attempt to deal with the \\"so-called upper classes of the Mississippi Delta\\" around the time of the Great Depression. Foote often expressed great affection for this novel, which was published in 1951. In Shiloh (1952) Foote foreshadows his use of historical narrative as he tells the story of the bloodiest battle in American history to that point from the first-person perspective of seven different characters. The narrative is presented by 17 characters ‚Äì Confederate soldiers Metcalf, Dade, and Polly; and Union soldiers Fountain, Flickner, with each of the twelve named soldiers in the Indiana squad given one section of that chapter. A close reading of this work reveals a very complete interlocked picture of the characters connecting with each other (Union with Union, Confederate with Confederate). The novel quickly sold 6,000 copies and received critical acclaim from reviewers. Later assessments from academic historians have been more mixed: historians Timothy S. Huebner and Madeleine M. McGrady have argued Foote \\"favored the South throughout the novel, portraying the Confederate cause as a fight for constitutional liberty and omitting any reference to slavery\\".Timothy S. Huebner, Madeleine M. McGrady. \\"Shelby Foote, Memphis, and the Civil War in American Memory\\". pp. 15‚Äì16 Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative, was published in 1954 and is a collection of novellas, short stories, and sketches from Foote's mythical Mississippi county. September, September (1978) is the story of three white Southerners who plot and kidnap the 8-year-old son of a wealthy African American, told against the backdrop of Memphis in September, 1957. Foote freely admitted he struggled to write realistic African-American characters, and had avoided including them in his work until September, September (1978). Foote admitted that writing black characters for the novel \\"scared the hell out of\\" him. Foote, in particular, struggled to write the wealthy black character Theo Wiggins. Foote confided to Walker Percy that the character was one of \\"those bourgeois negroes, and I never really knew a single bourgeois nigger in my life.\\" Although he was not one of America's best-known fiction writers, Foote was admired by his peers‚Äîamong them the aforementioned Walker Percy, Eudora Welty, and his literary hero William Faulkner, who once told a University of Virginia class that Foote \\"shows promise, if he'll just stop trying to write Faulkner, and will write some Shelby Foote.\\" Foote's fiction was recommended by both The New Yorker and critics from The New York Times Book Review. While writing his history of the war in the 1950s and 1960s, Foote was a liberal on racial issues. He supported school integration, opposed Eisenhower's hands-off approach to Southern racism and openly championed Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Foote protested against the KKK's use of the Confederate flag, believing 'that everything they stood for was almost exactly the opposite of everything the Confederacy had stood for'.C. Stuart Chapman. Shelby Foote: A Writer's Life (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2006), pp. xix, 185, 186, 201, 202. Foote was an outspoken supporter of the Civil Rights Movement in the South, arguing in 1968 that \\"the main problem facing the white, upper-class South is to decide whether or not the negro is a man ... if he is a man, as of course he is, then the negro is entitled to the respect an honorable man will automatically feel to an equal.‚ÄùTimothy S. Huebner, Madeleine M. McGrady. \\"Shelby Foote, Memphis, and the Civil War in American Memory\\". 18 Historian Foote moved to Memphis in 1952. Upon completion of Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative, he resumed work on what he thought would be his magnum opus, Two Gates to the City, an epic work he'd had in mind for years and in outline form since the spring of 1951. He had trouble making progress and felt he was plunging toward crisis with the \\"dark, horrible novel.\\" Unexpectedly, he received a letter from Bennett Cerf of Random House asking him to write a short history of the Civil War to appear for the conflict's centennial. According to Foote, Cerf contacted him based on the factual accuracy and rich detail he found in Shiloh, but Walker Percy's wife Bunt recalled that Walker had contacted Random House to approach Foote. Although the novelist had no experience writing serious history, Cerf offered him a contract for a work of approximately 200,000 words. Foote had never been trained in the traditional scholarly standards of academic historical research, which emphasized archives and footnotes. Instead he visited battlefields. He read widely, using standard biographies and campaign studies as well as recent books by Hudson Strode, Bruce Catton, James G. Randall, Clifford Dowdey, T. Harry Williams, Kenneth M. Stampp and Allan Nevins.Shelby Foote, \\"Bibliographical note\\" in Red River to Appomattox (1974) pp 1063‚Äì1064. He did not footnote his secondary sources nor use the archives but instead mined the primary sources in the 128-volume Official Records of the War of the Rebellion. Foote described himself as a \\"novelist-historian\\" who accepted \\"the historian‚Äôs standards without his paraphernalia\\" and \\"employed the novelist‚Äôs methods without his license.\\"Mitchell, Douglas. \\"'The Conflict Is behind Me Now\\": Shelby Foote Writes the Civil War.\\" The Southern Literary Journal, vol. 36, no. 1, 2003 21 Foote deliberately avoided the use of footnotes, arguing that \\"they would detract from the book's narrative quality by intermittently shattering the illusion that the observer is not so much reading a book as sharing an experience\\".Mitchell, Douglas. \\"'The Conflict Is behind Me Now': Shelby Foote Writes the Civil War.\\" The Southern Literary Journal, vol. 36, no. 1, 2003, p.25 He argued that footnotes would have \\"totally shattered what I was doing. I didn't want people glancing down at the bottom of the page every other sentence\\". Mackowski, C (ed.) 2020, Entertaining History : The Civil War in Literature, Film, and Song, Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, p.58 Foote concluded that most historians are \\"so concerned with finding out what happened that they make the enormous mistake of equating facts with truth...you can't get the truth from facts. The truth is the way you feel about it\\". Mackowski, C (ed.) 2020, Entertaining History : The Civil War in Literature, Film, and Song, Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, p.61 Foote worked for several weeks on an outline and decided that his plan couldn't be done to Cerf's specifications. He requested that the project be expanded to three volumes of 500,000 to 600,000 words each, and he estimated that the entire project would be done in nine years. Upon approval for the new plan, Foote commenced writing the comprehensive three volume, 3000-page history, together entitled The Civil War: A Narrative. The individual volumes are Fort Sumter to Perryville (1958), Fredericksburg to Meridian (1963), and Red River to Appomattox (1974). Foote supported himself during the twenty years he worked on the narrative with three Guggenheim Fellowships (1955‚Äì1960), Ford Foundation grants, and loans from Walker Percy. Scholarly reception and Lost Cause controversies While Foote has been praised as an engaging commentator on the Civil War, his sympathy toward Lost Cause viewpoints and his rejection of traditional scholarly standards of academic history have seen his work reappraised and criticized, as well as defended, in recent years. Timothy S. Huebner, Madeleine M. McGrady. \\"Shelby Foote, Memphis, and the Civil War in American Memory\\". 25 Foote's work has been accused of reproducing Lost Cause fallacies.C. Stuart Chapman. Shelby Foote: A Writer's LifeUniv. Press of Mississippi, 2006, p.xix, p. 69 Foote lauded Nathan Bedford Forrest as \\"one of the most attractive men who ever walked through the pages of history\\" and dismissed what he characterized as \\"propaganda\\" about Forrest's role in the Fort Pillow Massacre. Foote compared Forrest to John Keats and Abraham Lincoln, and suggested that he had tried to prevent the Fort Pillow Massacre, despite evidence to the contrary.Sharrett, Christopher. ‚ÄúReconciliation and the Politics of Forgetting: Notes on Civil War Documentaries.‚Äù Cin√©aste, vol. 36, no. 4, 2011, pp. 27Court Carney, \\"The Contested Image of Nathan Bedford Forrest.\\" Journal of Southern History 67.3 (2001): 601-630 online. Foote had a picture of Forrest hanging on his wall, and believed that \\"he's an enormously attractive, outgoing man once you get to know him and once you get to know more facts\\".Carter Coleman, Donald Faulkner, and William Kennedy \\"Shelby Foote, The Art of Fiction No. 158\\" 151 Paris Review (1999) https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/931/shelby-foote-the- art-of-fiction-no-158-shelby-foote Foote was staunchly anti-slavery, and believed that emancipation alone was insufficient to address historical wrongs done to African-Americans: \\"The institution of slavery is a stain on this nation's soul that will never be cleansed. It is just as wrong as wrong can be, a huge sin, and it is on our soul. There's a second sin that's almost as great and that's emancipation . . . There should have been a huge program for schools. There should have been all kinds of employment provided for them. Not modern welfare, you can't expect that in the middle of the nineteenth century, but there should have been some earnest effort to prepare these people for citizenship. They were not prepared, and operated under horrible disadvantages once the army was withdrawn, and some of the consequences are very much with us today.\\" Foote condemned the Freedmen's Bureau, which \\"did, perhaps, some good work, but it was mostly a joke, corrupt in all kinds of ways.\\" Foote's biographer has concluded that \\"at its best, Foote's writing dramatised tensions related to racial and regional identity. At its worst, it fell back on the social prescriptions of Southern paternalism.\\"C. Stuart Chapman. Shelby Foote: A Writer's LifeUniv. Press of Mississippi, 2006, p.xix Foote maintained that \\"the French Maquis did far worse things than the Ku Klux Klan ever did‚Äîwho never blew up trains or burnt bridges or anything else,\\" and that the First Klan \\"didn't even have lynchings.\\"Carter Coleman, Donald Faulkner, and William Kennedy. Shelby Foote, The Art of Fiction No. 158. The Paris Review Issue 151, Summer 1999The Convenient Suspension of Disbelief, Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Atlantic, 2011. Foote saw slavery as a cause of the Civil War, commenting that \\"the people who say slavery had nothing to do with the war are just as wrong as the people who say it had everything to do with the war.\\" Furthermore, Foote also argued that slavery was \\"an issue\\" but was used \\"almost as a propaganda thing,\\" and that \\"those who wanted to exploit it could grab onto it.\\" He developed new respect for such disparate figures as Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, Patrick Cleburne, Edwin Stanton and Jefferson Davis. By contrast, he grew to dislike such figures as Phil Sheridan and Joe Johnston. He considered United States President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest to be two authentic geniuses of the war. When he stated this opinion in conversation with one of General Forrest's granddaughters, she replied after a pause, \\"You know, we never thought much of Mr. Lincoln in my family.\\" While the work generated generally favorable reviews for its literary merits, Foote's efforts received pointed and strong criticisms from professional historians and scholars of slavery.Mitchell, Douglas. \\"'The Conflict Is behind Me Now': Shelby Foote Writes the Civil War.\\" The Southern Literary Journal, vol. 36, no. 1, 2003, 25Chandra Manning. \\"All for the Union...and Emancipation, too: What the Civil War Was About\\" Dissent, Volume 59, Number 1, Winter 2012, 93 Scholars criticized Foote for not including footnotes and for neglecting subjects such as economics and politics of the Civil War era, as well as the role of slavery and the participation of African Americans more generally. Foote was criticized for his lack of interest in more current historical research, and for a less firm grasp of politics than military affairs.Barr, Alwyn. ‚ÄúThe Journal of Southern History.‚Äù The Journal of Southern History, vol. 41, no. 3, 1975, pp. 418‚Äì419. Foote relied extensively on the work of Hudson Strode, whose sympathy for Lost Cause claims resulted in a portrait of Jefferson Davis as a tragic hero without many of the flaws attributed to him by other historians.\\" Foote has been described as writing \\"from a white Southern perspective, perhaps even with a certain bias\\": Radical Republicans are portrayed negatively in his work, and the name Frederick Douglass is absent from every volume of his Narrative. In 2011, the historian Annette Gordon-Reed suggested that Foote's work was powered by romantic nostalgia rather than an attempt at scholarship, with the work reflecting \\"the very strong mark of memory as opposed to history...the memories of that war which grew up with many white Southern males of his generation, are what power the narrative.\\"Timothy S. Huebner, Madeleine M. McGrady. \\"Shelby Foote, Memphis, and the Civil War in American Memory\\". 25 More broadly, Chandra Manning has suggested that Foote belongs to a school of Civil War historiography that \\"answers 'where does slavery fit in the Union cause' by saying 'nowhere,' except maybe in the most reluctant and instrumental way\\". The historian Joshua M. Zeitz described Foote as \\"living proof that many Americans‚Äîespecially those who are most interested in the Civil War‚Äîremain under the spell of a century-old tendency to mystify the Confederacy's martial glory at the expense of recalling the intense ideological purpose associated with its cause... [Foote is] living testimony to the failure of many Civil War enthusiasts and public figures to disavow the American army that fought under the rebel banner. As a nation, we remain very much under the spell of Robert E. Lee, even as we decry slavery and its legacy\\".Zeitz, Joshua Michael \\"Rebel redemption redux\\" Dissent; Philadelphia Vol. 48, Iss. 1, (Winter 2001): 70-77. Historian John F. Marszalek reviewing volume 3 focused on the purely military history covered by Foote: : The total effect is impressive ‚Äî a massive synthesis of Civil War scholarship as presented by a master of words....Shelby Foote has written a book that, despite weaknesses, will be long considered a major interpretation of the military history of the Civil War....Twenty years of dedicated labor have resulted in a literary masterpiece which places Shelby Foote among those very few historians who are authors of major syntheses....this history will long stand with the volumes of Bruce Catton as the final word on the military history of the Civil War.John F. Marszalek, \\"The Civil War, A Narrative: Red River to Appomattox: Review,\\" Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine (April 1976) 59#2 pp 223-225. In a 1997 interview with Donald Faulkner and William Kennedy, Foote stated that he would have fought for the Confederacy, and, \\"What's more, I would fight for the Confederacy today if the circumstances were similar. There's a great deal of misunderstanding about the Confederacy, the Confederate flag, slavery, the whole thing. The political correctness of today is no way to look at the middle of the 19th century. The Confederates fought for some substantially good things. States' rights is not just a theoretical excuse for oppressing people. You have to understand that the raggedy Confederate soldier who owned no slaves and probably couldn't even read the Constitution, let alone understand it, when he was captured by Union soldiers and asked, 'What are you fighting for?' replied, 'I'm fighting because you're down here.' So I certainly would have fought to keep people from invading my native state.\\"  Views on race and African-Americans  Beyond his sympathies for the Confederacy and the description of marginalization of African-Americans within his works, Foote retained complex, patriarchal and sympathetic views of African Americans and race relations.C. Stuart Chapman. Shelby Foote: A Writer's Life. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2006, 226 Foote continued to develop his perception of the travesties that befell blacks in Southern life, a culture that he would later call \\"perhaps the most racist society in the United States.\\" In his earlier life, Foote had claimed to know more about the life of African Americans in the South than James Baldwin: \\"I told some interviewer I knew a hell of a lot more about negroes than Baldwin even began to know.\\" Foote struggled with drawing on black characters as models for his writing, he was unable to pull from real- world examples of blacks in the 1950s without relying upon outdated stereotypes of blacks. Speaking in 1989, Foote stated that \\"this black separatist movement is a bunch of junk\\", believing that African-Americans should model themselves on Jews, who Foote believed had a talent for making money. Foote, however, believed \\"the odds against\\" black people were to be \\"too great\\" for them to succeed in the US, as a result of \\"having a different color skin\\". Foote maintained that the KKK of the 1920s was \\"mostly anti- Catholic, incidentally anti-Semitic and really was not much concerned about the Negro\\". Foote believed that his experience and knowledge of the South meant he understood African-American historical figures such as Nat Turner better than Northern African-American intellectuals, stating in the 1970s that \\"I think that I am closer to Nat Turner than James Baldwin is. I'm talking about, I am personally more like Nat Turner than James Baldwin is, even though they are both Negroes. I consider somebody out of Harlem to be very different from someone out of Tidewater Virginia\\". Harrington, Evans and Shelby Foote. ‚ÄúInterview With Shelby Foote.‚Äù The Mississippi Quarterly, vol. 24, no. 4, 1971, pp. 349‚Äì377, here p.359. By the 1970s, Foote believed that a \\"Jewish intellectual movement\\" had come to dominate American literature. Harrington, Evans and Shelby Foote. ‚ÄúInterview With Shelby Foote.‚Äù The Mississippi Quarterly, vol. 24, no. 4, 1971, pp. 349‚Äì377, here p.359. Later life After finishing September, September, Foote resumed work on Two Gates to the City, the novel he had set aside in 1954 to write the Civil War trilogy. The work still gave him trouble and he set it aside once more, in the summer of 1978, to write \\"Echoes of Shiloh,\\" an article for National Geographic Magazine. By 1981, he had given up on Two Gates altogether, though he told interviewers for years afterward that he continued to work on it. He served on the Naval Academy Advisory Board in the 1980s. Fred L. Schultz, \\"An interview with Shelby Foote: 'All life has a plot'.\\" Naval History 8.5 (1994): 36‚Äì39.. In 1986, Foote strongly denounced the Memphis chapter of the NAACP in their campaign for the removal of the Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument in Memphis, accusing them of anti-white prejudice: \\"the day that black people admire Forrest as much as I do is the day when they will be free and equal, for they will have gotten prejudice out of their minds as we whites are trying to get it out of ours.\\"Timothy S. Huebner, Madeleine M. McGrady. \\"Shelby Foote, Memphis, and the Civil War in American Memory\\". 22 Foote argued in favor of \\"the Confederate flag flying anywhere anybody wants to fly it at any time. If they have a referendum in a state that says ‚ÄòTake the flag down off the state capitol,‚Äô I think they ought to take the flag down. But the flag to me represents many noble things.\\"Bill Kauffman. \\"We Could Use a Shelby Foote Today.\\" The American Conservative 29 November 2017 https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/we-could-use-a-shelby-foote- today/ In the late 1980s, Ken Burns had assembled a group of consultants to interview for his Civil War documentary. Foote was not in this initial group, though Burns had Foote's trilogy on his reading list. A phone call from Robert Penn Warren prompted Burns to contact Foote. Burns and crew traveled to Memphis in 1986 to film an interview with Foote in the anteroom of his study. In November 1986, Foote figured prominently at a meeting of dozens of consultants gathered to critique Burns' script. Burns interviewed Foote on- camera in Memphis and Vicksburg in 1987. That same year, he became a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The Civil War historian Judkin Browning has noted that Foote's outspoken praise of Nathan Bedford Forrest in the documentary ensured \\"Lost Causers raised their beer mugs in salute while historians hurled their lagers at their televisions.\\"Judkin Browning \\"On Leadership: Heroes and Villains of the First Modern War\\" Reviews in American History, Volume 45, Number 3, September 2017, 442 Foote has been further criticized for repeating \\"plainly wrong\\" Lost Cause tropes in his commentary, particularly over the issue of apparently \\"overwhelming\\" Northern industrial advantage and his downplaying of the role of slavery in causing the Civil War. Foote remained adamant that slavery was not a major cause of the Civil War, stating in 2001 that \\"no soldier on either side gave a damn about the slaves‚Äîthey were fighting for other reasons entirely in their minds.\\" The Civil War historian Harold Holzer was a further critic of Foote's presentation of Forrest. \\"Ken Burns always looks for varied voices and he always looks for characters, and Shelby Foote was certainly a character,\\" Holzer says. \\"The most amazing thing he said was that the two great geniuses of the war were Lincoln and Nathan Bedford Forrest. Foote somehow compared the great emancipator with a man who owned slaves, murdered blacks and joined the Ku Klux Klan.\\"Hillel Italie. \\"Debate over Ken Burns Civil War doc continues over decades\\" November 4, 2017. https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/debate-over-ken- burns-civil-war-doc-continues-over-decades-2/ The historians of slavery and the Civil War era Eric Foner and Leon Litwack added to these criticisms, suggesting that Foote consistently underplayed the extent of Southern white racism, in effect treating \\"white southerners\\" as synonymous with all \\"southerners.\\"Lex Renda. \\"Review: Robert Brent Toplin, ed. Ken Burns's The Civil War: Historians Respond\\" H-CivWar (August, 1996)https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=547 Litwack concluded that \\"Foote is an engaging battlefield guide, a master of the anecdote, and a gifted and charming story teller, but he is not a good historian.\\" When Burns's documentary aired in September 1990, Foote appeared in almost 90 segments, about one hour of the 11-hour series. Foote's drawl and erudition made him a favorite. He was described as \\"the toast of Public TV,\\" \\"the media's newest darling,\\" and \\"prime time's newest star,\\" and the result was a burst of book sales. In one week at the end of September 1990, each volume of the paperback The Civil War: A Narrative sold 1,000 copies per day. By the middle of 1991, Random House had sold 400,000 copies of the trilogy. Foote later told Burns, \\"Ken, you've made me a millionaire.\\" The extent of Foote's apparent apologia for white Southern racism and Lost Cause mythologising was satirised in the character of Sherman Hoyle in the 2004 mockumentary C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America, a character defined by his \\"consistent lamenting of and apologies for the good ole days.\\"Trudier Harris. \\"Twenty- First-Century Slavery Or, How to Extend the Confederacy for Two\\" Foote professed to be a reluctant celebrity. When The Civil War was first broadcast, his telephone number was publicly listed and he received many phone calls from people who had seen him on television. Foote never unlisted his number, and the volume of calls increased each time the series re-aired. Many Memphis natives were known to pay Foote a visit at his East Parkway residence in Midtown Memphis. Horton Foote, the playwright and screenwriter (To Kill A Mockingbird, Baby the Rain Must Fall and Tender Mercies) was the voice of Jefferson Davis in the PBS series. The two Footes are third cousins; their great-grandfathers were brothers. \\"And while we didn't grow up together, we have become friends; I was the voice of Jefferson Davis in that TV series\\", Horton Foote added proudly.Hidden Treasures: Searching for God in Modern Culture, James M. Wall, Christian Century Foundation, 1997, p. 12 In 1992 Foote received an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina. In the early 1990s, Foote was interviewed by journalist Tony Horwitz for the project on American memory of the Civil War which Horwitz eventually published as Confederates in the Attic (1998). Foote was also a member of The Modern Library's editorial board for the re-launch of the series in the mid-1990s, this series published two books excerpted from his Civil War narrative. Foote also contributed a long introduction to their edition of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage giving a narrative biography of the author. He also received the 1992 St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. Foote was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994. Also in 1994, Foote joined Protect Historic America and was instrumental in opposing a Disney theme park near battlefield sites in Virginia. Along the way, Burns asked him to return for his upcoming documentary Baseball, where he appeared in both the 2nd Inning discussing his recollections of the dynamics of the crowds in his youth and in the 5th Inning (TV series), where he gave an account of his meeting Babe Ruth. In 1998, the author Tony Horwitz visited Foote for his book Confederates in the Attic, a meeting in which Foote declared he was \\"dismayed\\" by the \\"behavior of blacks, who are fulfilling every dire prophesy the Ku Klux Klan made\\", and that African Americans were \\"acting as if the utter lie about blacks being somewhere between ape and man were true\\".Sharrett, Christopher. \\"Reconciliation and the Politics of Forgetting: Notes on Civil War Documentaries.\\" Cin√©aste, vol. 36, no. 4, 2011, pp. 28 Foote emphasized that his loyalties during the 1860s would have been to white Southerners: \\"I‚Äôd be with my people, right or wrong.\\"Mary A. DeCredico. \\"Book Review: Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War\\" Armed Forces & Society 26(2): 2000, 339 Foote also argued that freedmen had led to the failure of Reconstruction and that the Confederate flag represented \\"law, honour, love of country.\\" Foote stated that he would have been willing to fight to maintain slavery: \\"If I was against slavery, I'd still be with the South. I'm a man, my society needs me, here I am.\\" On September 2, 2001, Shelby Foote was the focus of the C-SPAN television program In-Depth. In a 3-hour interview, conducted by C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb, Foote shows off the library of his home, working room, and writing desk, and details the writing of his books as well as taking on-air calls and emails. Foote campaigned in the 2001 referendum on the Flag of Mississippi, arguing against a proposal which would have replaced the Confederate battle flag with a blue canton with 20 stars.Reed, John Shelton (2002). The Banner That Won't Stay Furled. Southern Cultures, 8(1), 85. Foote rejected the Confederate flag's association with white supremacy and argued \\"I‚Äôm for the Confederate flag always and forever. Many among the finest people this country has ever produced died in that war. To take it and call it a symbol of evil is a misrepresentation.\\"Reed, John Shelton (2002). The Banner That Won't Stay Furled. Southern Cultures, 8(1), 88 In 2003 Foote received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust. Foote died at Baptist Hospital in Memphis on June 27, 2005, aged 88. He had had a heart attack after a recent pulmonary embolism.\\"Shelby Foote Dies; Novelist and Historian of Civil War\\", Washington Post, June 29, 2005 He was interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. His grave is beside the family plot of General Forrest.Susanna Henighan Potter, Moon Tennessee, 44 (Moon Handbooks, Avalon Travel Publishing, 2009) Legacy The reviews all praised the style of the trilogy. However the academic reviewers often complained about the absence of footnotes, and Foote's deliberate refusal to cover social, economic, and racial themes. The eminent Southern historian, C. Vann Woodward, cautioned that the academicians had themselves abdicated their most honored role: :Professionals do well to apply the term ‚Äúamateur‚Äù with caution to the historian outside their ranks. The word does have deprecatory and patronizing connotations that occasionally backfire. This is especially true of narrative history, which nonprofessionals have all but taken over. The gradual withering of the narrative impulse in favor of the analytical urge among professional academic historians has resulted in a virtual abdication of the oldest and most honored role of the historian, that of storyteller. Having abdicated...the professional is in a poor position to patronize amateurs who fulfill the needed function he has abandoned.C. Vann Woodward, ‚ÄúThe Great American Butchery,‚Äù New York Review of Books (March 6, 1975) online. Woodward, who wrote a best-selling naval history of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, added that, \\"In no field is the abdication of the professionals more evident than in military history, the strictly martial, guns-and-battle aspect of war, the most essential aspect.\\"Woodwards (1975). In 1993 Richard N. Current argued that Foote too often depended on a single, unsupported source for life-like details, but \\"probably is as accurate as most historians.... Foote's monumental narrative most likely will continue to be read and remembered as a classic of its kind.\\" Richard N, Current, \\"Review\\", Journal of Southern History (Aug 1993) 59#3 p. 595. In a 2011 commentary Ta- Nehisi Coates concluded that Foote was not guilty of \\"neo-Confederate apologia.\\" However, Foote \\"gave twenty years of his life, and three volumes of important and significant words to the Civil War, but he could never see himself in the slave. He could not get that the promise of free bread can not cope with the promise of free hands. Shelby Foote wrote The Civil War, but he never understood it. Understanding the Civil War was a luxury his whiteness could ill-afford.\\"Ta-Nehisi Coates \\"The Convenient Suspension of Disbelief\\". The Atlantic. 13 June 2011 https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/the-convenient- suspension-of-disbelief/240318/ In 2013, the Sons of Confederate Veterans used Foote's presentation of Nathan Bedford Forrest as a \\"humane slave holder\\" to protest against the removal of his statue in Memphis. Foote had argued that Forrest \\"avoided splitting up families or selling [slaves] to cruel plantation owners.\\"Kevin Levin. \\"The Ku Klux Klan Protests as Memphis Renames a City Park\\" Citylab. 27 February 2013 https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/02/ku- klux-klan-protests-memphis-renames-city-park/4820/ In October 2017, John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff for President Donald Trump, argued that \\"the lack of ability to compromise led to the Civil War.\\" He also described Robert E. Lee as an \\"honorable man\\" who \\"gave up ... his country to fight for his state,\\" and claimed that \\"men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had to make their stand.\\"Astor, Maggie (October 31, 2017). \\"John Kelly Pins Civil War on a 'Lack of Ability to Compromise'\\".

Retrieved October 31, 2017 In response to the ensuing controversy, the White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited the work of Foote in defense of Kelly: \\"I do know that many historians, including Shelby Foote in Ken Burns' famous Civil War documentary, agreed that a failure to compromise was a cause of the Civil War.\\"Mitchell, Ellen (October 31, 2017). \\"White House defends Kelly's Civil War remarks\\".

On October 18, 2019, a Mississippi Writers Trail historical marker was installed in Greenville, Mississippi, to honor the literary and historical contributions of Shelby Foote. Foote's distinctive Southern accent was the model for Daniel Craig's character in the 2019 film Knives Out. https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/daniel-craig-based-his-knives-out- accent-on-a-famous-civil-war-historian.html/ Bibliography Many of Foote's books can be borrowed at no cost from online libraries.See Internet Archive (2020) =Fiction= *Tournament (1949) *Follow Me Down (1950) *Love in a Dry Season (1951) *Shiloh: A Novel (1952) *Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative (1954) =The Civil War: A Narrative= *The Civil War: A Narrative.

director's Revolution Trilogy, besides El prisionero trece and El compadre Mendoza. An anti-epic based on a novel, it focuses on the cruelty of the Mexican Revolution and Pancho Villa himself, contrary to most of the Mexican movies about this national hero. The movie is thought to have been the first Mexican super-production and led to the bankruptcy of the film company that made it. Plot Villa was portrayed by Domingo Soler. Directed by Fernando de Fuentes, the film tells the story of a group of friends who hear about the revolution and Villa and decide to join him, only to suffer the cruel reality of war under the command of a Villa who simply does not care about his men. The movie has two endings: the original ending shows the last surviving friend returning to his home, disenchanted with both Villa and the Revolution. The second ending, discovered many years later, returns to the same scene ten years later, when an old and weakened Villa tries to recruit the last survivor again; when the father hesitates as he does not want to leave his wife and daughter behind, Villa kills the wife and daughter. The angry father then tries to kill Villa, before another man shoots the father dead. Villa takes the sole survivor, the son, with him. Background A great failure when released, interest in the movie resurged many decades later, and today is considered one of the best movies of Mexican cinema both for its approach to the theme and its technical merits. It stands apart among the many movies made about Villa in that it portrays the man and the Revolution in its cruelty; most other films, like those by Ismael Rodr√≠guez in the 1960s, take an almost idyllic view of both, following the official (government) mythos. The movie music was composed by Silvestre Revueltas, who makes a cameo appearance.

It was founded in 1888 for students who were not attached to the existing colleges.History of St Cuthbert's Society St Cuthbert's Society is a Bailey college, based on Durham's peninsula next to the River Wear, although it also has other accommodation a few minutes' walk away in Old Elvet. St Cuthbert's retains its title of 'society', although its workings have changed since its formation.Tudor, Henry, St. Cuthbert's Society, 1888‚Äì1988: The history of 'a modest but exciting institution in the University of Durham'. 1988. Its foundation differed from that of Durham's other colleges in that it was established as a common room for, and by, its students. Other Societies followed: St Aidan's Society ‚Äì now St Aidan's College, and the Graduate Society ‚Äì now Ustinov College. It is still home to the highest proportion of local students of those at Durham-based colleges (although not if the two Stockton-based colleges are included), and also traditionally houses a high proportion of mature students. It is the only collegiate body to offer undergraduates catered, self-catered, and part catered accommodation. History View down South Bailey to left At its formation, the Society consisted largely of mature students, was non- residential and run by the students themselves. It elected a President and an Executive Committee to organise social events, sports teams and other clubs, manage the common room and other facilities largely (but not exclusively) provided by the University, and represent members' concerns to the academic authorities.Tudor, Henry, St. Cuthbert's Society, 1888‚Äì1988. 1988. Chap. 1. Origins and Early Years, p. 12. The University appointed a Junior Proctor and later a Censor who was employed by the University to oversee the Society's members.Tudor, Henry, St. Cuthbert's Society, 1888‚Äì1988. 1988. Chap. 1. Origins and Early Years, p. 11. Among the early Censors, Frank Byron Jevons and Percy John Heawood were both scholars of considerable note.Tudor, Henry, St. Cuthbert's Society, 1888‚Äì1988. 1988. Chap. 1. Origins and Early Years, p. 11-26. The Society grew in size until the Second World War when numbers of students in the University dropped sharply and the Society was effectively in abeyance until 'refounded' in 1945 by veterans returning from combat who wished to complete their degrees. When the Society moved to the South Bailey in 1951, it began to offer accommodation to a small number of students and created the position of Principal to replace that of Censor. The first Principal, Clifford Leech, a distinguished academic and widely acknowledged expert on Jacobean literature, served for several years in this role before going on to become Professor of English at the University of Toronto. His portrait, by Thomas William Pattison (1894‚Äì1983), hangs in the college hall. The Principal is now responsible for managing all aspects of the Society. The Society includes a dedicated team of University staff, a junior common room, a senior room, an alumni association and a group of fellows. Over the years the Society has expanded a great deal and now has a large body of accommodation on the Bailey as well as elsewhere in Durham. In 2006 'Brooks House' was built and this allowed all first year undergraduates to live-in for the first time, as well as a number of returners and postgraduate students. Traditions The patron of the Society, St. Cuthbert, continues to be remembered annually, if somewhat incongruously for an ascetic, in The Feast, a traditional banquet held on or near St. Cuthbert's feast day of 20 March each year. Another annual event is Cuths Day, a day of entertainment conducted on, off and in the River Wear, which curls around the foot of the bailey where the Society is based. The surviving ‚ÄòRefounders‚Äô of the Society hold a reunion weekend every September in college. The same weekend also hosts the Annual General Meeting of St Cuthbert's Association, the alumni organisation of the Society. In addition to this, the Founders of the Society are remembered at the annual Founders' Formal and past Presidents attend the President's Formal. Although the Bailey colleges are generally considered to be more traditional, St Cuthbert's Society generally employs a more informal approach; for example, unlike the other Bailey colleges its students no longer wear gowns except for congregation. St Cuthbert's also has a strong historical rivalry with nearby Hatfield College, which manifests itself in sports and other activities as well as singing songs (of varying degrees of offensiveness). There is a story that, in the 1960s, a group of Cuths students stole a lion statue from Hatfield and painted it to look like a tiger, to avoid arousing suspicion.Shield of St Cuthbert =Coat of arms= The original seventh- century pectoral cross of St. Cuthbert was discovered when his grave was opened in 1827, and is now preserved in the cathedral treasury. The motto, gratia gratiam parit, appears in the Adagia of Erasmus, a collection of Greek and Latin adages, and can be loosely translated as ‚Äòfriendship begets friendship‚Äô or ‚Äòkindness begets kindness‚Äô. The full coat of arms includes an eider duck as the crest. This is because, while resident in the Farne Islands, St Cuthbert instituted special laws to protect these and other seabirds nesting there, creating what may have been the first bird protection laws anywhere in the world. Consequently, eider ducks have long been known as 'cuddy ducks' (Cuthbert's ducks) in the Pitmatic dialect as spoken in Northumberland. Accommodation left The headquarters of St Cuthbert's Society is situated in South Bailey and it is therefore a Bailey college, but the majority of the Society's accommodation is at Parsons Field, in Old Elvet. The site consists of four buildings, with one (Brooks House) including en- suite facilities, and the others (Refounders House, Parsons Field Court and Fonteyn Court) consisting of standard single rooms. Returning students typically live in Brooks House, with other buildings at Parsons Field being primarily for first year undergraduates. By having catered, part catered and self-catered accommodation, St Cuthbert's Society offers a choice of meal packages to students. Other facilities include a library, two common rooms, two bars, two gyms, two computer rooms, a conference room, and a music room.St Cuthbert's Society. St Cuthbert's Society JCR: Freshers' Handbook 09-10. Student life The Society has over 40 sports and societies, including a rugby team, a boat club, a running club, a drama society, an art society, a big band and a choir.Societies =Boat Club= Launched in the summer of 1893, five years after the foundation of the Society itself, the Boat Club offers training and facilities for rowers of all levels and commitment. It is one of the oldest and most distinguished student societies in the university. =Running Club= Founded in 2016, the running club is currently one of the most successful sports teams in the college. The club also offers personalised coaching plans and very popular socials that regularly attract upwards of 50 members. List of principals * Clifford Leech (1948‚Äì52) * E. de Groot, (1952‚Äì54) * W.

It may be an erotic dance performed by a sex worker or it may be done as a leisure activity. Sex work In some jurisdictions, a table dance may be an alternative to a lap dance, due to laws preventing exotic dancers from making contact with customers. For example, in Waterloo, Ontario, a table dance is performed on a small portable platform the dancer takes around to patrons‚Äô tables. The Windmill Theatre in Soho, London operated as a strip club from the 1990s until 2018. The club's licensing conditions included a \\"no touching\\" rule and the club had a licence for striptease, pole-dancing and table dancing. Establishments Bartop dancing is encouraged at Coyote Ugly's chain of bars Similar is the bartop dance, performed for the entertainment of those seated at the bar. The film Coyote Ugly ushered in a fad of bartop dancing establishments. Set in New York City's bar of the same name, several establishments around the city (e.g. Coyote Ugly, Hogs and Heifers, Red Rock West Saloon, Doc Holliday's Saloon) actively encouraged women to jump on the bar and dance, contributing to an \\"Anything Goes\\" atmosphere. Hogs and Heifers encourages dancers to leave their brassiere hanging from the ceiling to commemorate their dance. However, table dancing is forbidden at many events and establishments. Table dancing by patrons (both male and female) became more common in New York after the enforcement of the City's cabaret licenses (required for dancing establishments) was relaxed around the time of the 2001 election of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 2002, the Hilton sisters Paris and Nicky were reputed to be constant table dancers at club Bungalow 8. Nicky denied the allegations and claimed that they only dance on the banquettes, and added that she did it purely \\"because it was fun\\". At another restaurant named Da Silvano, it was reported that Kim Cattrall, Candace Bushnell and Patricia Duff were seen table dancing together. Duff said \\"Somebody placed me up on the table, so I danced,\\" and that the night was \\"spontaneous and magical\\". Carnivals and festivals Another form of table dance is practiced at traditional events like in Brazilian, European and Australian Carnivals, in German beer tents during Oktoberfest, and at other similar events. However, this kind of table dance is not of an erotic nature. As this dance often leads to accidents, especially if performed by intoxicated individuals or when tables collapse, it is forbidden at many events but dancing on chairs or benches may still be allowed.

While she had Broadway roles in Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar and Grease, she is most famous for her role as Donna Beck Tyler Cortlandt Sago Tyler on the soap opera All My Children, a role she played from 1976 to 1992. Donna was originally a troubled youth, who was a runaway and a prostitute. In her first appearance on All My Children, Donna is found in a hospital bed and in a coma after being beaten up by her pimp, Tyrone. However, the actress playing the part of Donna was not Candice Earley, but a different actress originally hired to play the part. The producers were unsatisfied with the acting ability of this actress, and Earley was hired to play the part, which was slated to be a short-term role. Earley's portrayal proved popular with viewers, and won an award for Most Exciting New Actress in the first annual Soapies held in 1977 (these awards are now known as the Soap Opera Digest Awards).

In 1888, a post office was established, with John A. Coovert as the first postmaster.Bonnie Ketterl Kane, A Brief Overview of the History of Neenach. Although Kane states that the post office was originally known as Neenah and it became known later as Neenach, she cites no source. The first mention of Neenach in the Los Angeles Times was on September 4, 1890, reporting a marriage license issued to Uriah W. Pratt, 32, and Estelle Hereford, 24, both \\"of Neenach.\\" There were no references in the Times data base under any other spelling. In September 1905 Christian Clausen was named postmaster. James Anderson filed a homestead claim for 160 acres (647,000 m¬≤) at present-day State Route 138 and 300th Street West in 1887. He had a county contract to maintain and improve roads in the Antelope Valley as far as Three Points. Construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between 1905 and 1913, which brought water from the distant Owens Valley to the San Fernando Valley, was important to the area. On July 13, 1917, Chief Water Engineer William Mulholland of the city of Los Angeles, the builder of the aqueduct, received word that the line had been broken. He went to Neenach and found a 60-foot rupture. He ordered additional surveillance, which saw the arrest of one man, an employee of the rival Los Angeles Gas and Electric Company. The suspect was later released.Catherine Mullholland, William Mulholland and the Rise of Los Angeles, University of California Press, 2002, p. 262. James Anderson became a line rider or patrolman on the aqueduct: He had to shut down the tunnel periodically to check its condition. He also checked the surface to verify that none of the aqueduct's opponents had damaged it. Harry Womersley, from England by way of Illinois, was another resident who worked on the aqueduct‚Äîthe 12 miles from Fairmont to Neenach. Gold was discovered in the hills south of the community in the early 1930s. The \\"Oh Suzanna\\" mine produced some $7 million over the few years of its operation. In the 1970s, Neenach was lively, one resident told a reporter. There were community-wide potluck dinners and almost 80 members in the local 4-H Club. Since then, he said, many of the kids moved away as soon as they were able. The future A portion of nearby Tejon Ranch called Centennial is proposed to be a 23,000-home master-planned community adjacent to Neenach. Civic squares, parks, shops, three fire stations, and other services are proposed. Children would be encouraged to walk to one of the eight elementary schools planned. The promoters have pledged to create 30,000 local jobs. On average, a new house would be erected every eight hours, seven days a week, for 20 years. The Tucson, Arizona,-based Center for Biological Diversity, however, opposes the project‚Äîclaiming that Centennial would be built on rare ecosystems, including the largest native grassland left in California. The proposal has yet to be approved by county officials. Education =Schools= Neenach Elementary School has no students today but is kept in good condition. Neenach is part of the Westside Union School District of West Lancaster, which also operates Del Sur, Joe Walker, Hill View, Cottenwood, Rancho Vista, Sundown, Valley View, Leona Valley, and Quartz Hill schools, through the eighth grade. The present Neenach School building was constructed in the 1990s to replace an older building that had stood for decades on a neighboring lot. The school was closed in 2001 because of dwindling population and high heating costs; lack of a natural-gas source meant the school was all-electric. Sixty- six pupils were enrolled the previous year. The community is within the Antelope Valley Union High School District and the Antelope Valley Community College District. Neenach Meteorite The Neenach Meteorite, discovered in 1948 and photographed in 2007 The Neenach Meteorite is a 30-pound mass of stony, ordinary chondrite discovered in April 1948 by Elden Snyder of Neenach when he unearthed it with his plow, in the process breaking it into four pieces.

In a scholia in the work of Adam of Bremen, he is reported to have been elected king after the violent death of two pretenders,The article Halsten in Nordisk familjebok (1909). but took over a highly volatile situation. While he was clearly a Christian like his father and brother, his influence may have been limited, since Adam relates that Christianity was so disturbed that the bishops appointed by the Archdiocese of Bremen did not even dare to travel to Sweden. He was deposed after a short while, in the late 1060s or early 1070s, and replaced by a princeling from Gardariki, Anund. Possible later reign That he later on ruled together with his brother Inge has some support from a papal letter from 1081, by Pope Gregory VII, which refers to two kings with the initials A and I, and where they are called kings of V√§sterg√∂tland (rege wisigothorumKaliff, A.

He was the father of the co-rulers Philip and Inge the Younger. The Hervarar saga, which is one of the few sources about the kings of this time, has the following to tell: {  Hallsteinn h√©t sonr Steinkels konungs, br√≥√∞ir Inga konungs, er konungr var me√∞ Inga konungi, br√≥√∞ur s√≠num.

Founded in 1947 as the St Aidan's Society, but able to trace its roots back to the end of the 19th century, the college is named for St Aidan of Lindisfarne. History Front view of the central building The college has its origins in the small group of women, known as home students, who were first allowed to study at Durham in 1895. At that time, and indeed until the Second World War, it was considered unsuitable for female students to live in lodgings: they either had to be members of a College or to live at home. The numbers were never very large; for example, in 1936 there were only five. However, a substantial increase in the number of female students after 1945 meant that the former group of home students was reorganised, emerging as the St Aidan's Society in 1947. The St Aidan's Society had its offices at 24 North Bailey (now the bar and club of the Durham Union Society). Some of the students lived in Shincliffe Hall, and others in lodgings. A Common Room was soon found in 50 North Bailey and chapel services held at the church of St Mary-le-Bow. The first principal was Ethleen Scott,'SCOTT, Ethleen Mary', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 7 April 2013 having been \\"Censor\\" of the female home students since 1937. In 1961 St Aidan's was reconstituted as a full \\"Council College\\" (meaning that its governing council is a sub-committee of the University Council, the university's governing body). It moved to its present buildings on Elvet Hill in 1964, becoming one of the first of the university's \\"Hill\\" colleges. The college buildings are in a modernist style, having been designed by architect Sir Basil Spence and arranged in a semi- circular arrangement surrounding a central lawn. The original design was intended to represent the hand of God holding a jewel, with the curved corridors as the fingers, the straight corridors as his thumb, and a small chapel as the jewel. However, financial constraints prevented the chapel from ever being built and later extensions to the straight section did not follow the original idea. In 1963, Scott was succeeded as principal by Dame Enid Russell-Smith,'RUSSELL-SMITH, Dame Enid (Mary Russell)', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012 ; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 7 April 2013 who handed over to Irene Hindmarsh in 1970.'HINDMARSH, Irene', Who's Who 2013, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2013; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012 ; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 7 April 2013 It was during her tenure as principal that it was agreed that St Aidan's should become a mixed college. The first male students were admitted in 1981. John Ashworth took over in 1998, before becoming Dean of Colleges in 2007, at which point Susan Frenk became acting principal. In 2008 work on improvements to the extensions were started. The aim was to turn previous fresher rooms into ensuite accommodation for finalists and postgraduates. In February 2009 students were allowed to tour the newly refurbished extensions, named Elizabeth Pease House. Organisation St Aidans College entrance The college membership divides itself between the Senior Common Room (SCR) and the Junior Common Room (JCR). The SCR is a self-regulating body of senior members of the university, college officers, tutors and postgraduate students. The JCR consists of the undergraduate members of the college and elects its own officers, including a sabbatical president and a bar steward, who liaise on its behalf with the college and university. =Principals= The current principal is Dr Susan Frenk, a lecturer in Spanish and Latin-American culture. *Ethleen Scott (1947?‚Äì1970) *Dame Enid Russell-Smith (1963‚Äì1970) *Irene Hindmarsh (1970‚Äì1988) *Robert Williams (1991‚Äì1997) *John Ashworth (1998‚Äì2007) *Susan Frenk (2007‚Äìpresent) Societies =Boat club= In 1954 St Aidan's College Boat Club (SACBC) was founded.

In the late 18th century, after the loss of the Tataviam Native Americans ‚Äì the area's original inhabitants ‚Äì to Indian Reductions as Mission Indians at the Mission San Fernando immigrants from Spain and Mexico quickly established themselves. The majority of the immigrants were primarily interested in the land in order to establish cattle ranches. During the 1830s, the ranches were broken up into smaller homesteads by farmers from Germany, France and the state of Nebraska. The Ritter family started one of the first wineries in this country in Leona Valley which was later shut down by the U.S. Prohibition period in the early 20th century. In 1901 Frank D Hall bought the 3000 acre St. Anthony Ranch. The valley was then known as Leonis and he changed the name of the ranch to Leona Valley Ranch and set about building a dairy farm. The Ranch was most of the land west of Bouquet Canyon Rd. The dairy did not work out and the subdivision of the Leona Valley Ranch started in 1918. That first phase of the subdivision was for properties that had roads and water (either had water or was in an area known to be practical for drilling a well). One of the early sales was the southwest corner of Elizabeth Lake Rd and 90th St West. The Nolenberger's built a store and gas station on that lot which opened in 1924. The building is now Hemme Hay and Feed store. In 1927 Frank Hall incorporated Farm Home Builders to handle the next phase that required new roads and a water system. To that end Farm Home Builders took out a loan for $45,000. The Great Depression hit before many sold and it wasn't until the 1940s that most were sold. The majority of those old large homestead parcels have since been partially subdivided and developed with a mix of custom residences, with Leona Valley still maintaining a spacious beauty. Businesses Some local businesses that can be found in Leona Valley include Rancher's Market, a small convenience store, Jack's Place Which Opened July 4, 2015, Casa Gutierrez, The Dog House (pet grooming), Hemme Hay and Feed Store, an auto body shop, and a small antique store.

Following the grant of a supplemental charter in 1895 allowing women to receive degrees of the university, St Mary's was founded as the Women's Hostel in 1899, adopting its present name in May 1920. History =Founding= Abbey House St Mary's first home was at 33 Claypath with six students, before moving into Abbey House on Palace Green, then to 9 The College behind Durham Cathedral, which is now occupied by the Chorister School. In 1952, it moved to a new site on Elvet Hill, becoming the first of the \\"hill colleges\\". The foundation stone for the new building, now known as the Fergusson Building, was laid in 1947 by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). St Mary's is the only one of the hill colleges to have been founded in the 19th century. =Change to a mixed college= For several decades there had been debates about St Mary‚Äôs continuing as a single-sex college within the University, and it had been originally mooted in the 1970s that it should go mixed. The Middle Common Room, which consisted of postgraduate students, went mixed in the early 1990s. St Mary's was the last of Durham's colleges to become entirely mixed when it took in both males and females at undergraduate level in 2005, ending over a hundred years of tradition. During the decision-making process the student body was split. Some members of the College felt so strongly against the proposed plans in 2000 that they protested, marching on the University Offices at Old Shire Hall. There had been several polls of the student body over the issue of the College going mixed, and from 1999 onwards these were held almost annually. The results tended to be close, but marginally in favour of retaining the status quo. The transition to a mixed college took place in 2005, and the first male JCR President, James Liddell, was elected in 2009. The college still provides single-sex accommodation for both sexes as and when required. The recently refurbished Shepherd wing of the Fergusson building is a segregated women's-only area for students who, for personal, religious or other reasons, would prefer single sex accommodation. A refurbishment of the Williamson building took place between July and December 2007. Facilities & Traditions Entrance to St. Mary's College dining hall. The College is centred on two main buildings: the Fergusson and Williamson Buildings. The Fergusson building, designed by Vincent Harris, was built in the early 1950s and houses most of the College facilities, including the college's dining hall, two computer rooms, the College library, the Chapel, a laundry, two student common rooms and three music rooms. The Chapel is located on the top floor of the North East wing and was designed by the ecclesiastical architect George Pace. In addition to interiors and furniture produced by Thompson of Kilburn (the Mouseman), it now houses a sculpture of the Blessed Virgin Mary by acclaimed sculptor Fenwick Lawson, which was commissioned in 2005 by the College.250x250pxThe basement location of the Chapel prior to the 1960s now houses the JCR Bar which is managed by a Student Sabbatical Bars Steward. Opposite the Bar entrance is the Toastie Bar. At the other end of the basement is the JCR Shop which stocks sweets and snacks as well as toiletries, college clothing and some memorabilia. The Williamson building was built in the early 1960s and is mainly an accommodation block with 110 study bedrooms. On the ground floor there is a student common room and one half of the lower ground floor contains the JCR fitness room and a laundry. In the 1990s three ensuite blocks were built on to the front of the Williamson building and are the only ensuite rooms in the college, with the exception of a few located in the Shepherd Wing. These are mainly filled by 2nd, 3rd or 4th year students who move back into college accommodation, but some are made available to students from any year group who require an ensuite room for medical or personal reasons. In 2015, principal Simon Hackett opened the new Boughton Wing in Williamson building which was established to maintain this provision and provide women-only accommodation to those who require it.https://www.instagram.com/p/9L9ugsASen/ Student life St Mary's College Boat Club Crest The majority of students located on site are first years, who are required to 'live in'. These students change rooms each term using a 'room ballot' system to ensure that no-one has to share a room for more than one term of their first year. 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students often choose to 'live out' in houses around Durham, although accommodation is available on-site for those who want it. The room ballot ceased to operate at the start of the 2015-2016 academic year and those who lived in kept their rooms for the whole academic year. All those who live on site are fully catered, except in exceptional circumstances. The College requires the wearing of gowns at formal dinners, which are held between two and three times a term and on the first and last Sunday of each term. Further to this the College requires gowns to be worn at JCR meetings and Matriculation. Large student led events are held throughout the year, notable highlights include Masquerade Ball, Midsummer Ball and Mary's Day. The College also has its own boat club, St Mary's College Boat Club, which welcomes any members of the college to join in and participate.

Richard Strauss's head on a silver platter satirizes the decapitation of John the Baptist in his operatic version of Wilde's Salome Not a commercial success in Europe, Paul Chabas's September Morn ended up in the permanent collection of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, after scandalising Anthony Comstock and his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Succ√®s de scandale (French for \\"success from scandal\\") is a term for any artistic work whose success is attributed, in whole or in part, to public controversy surrounding the work. In some cases the controversy causes audiences to seek out the work for its titillating content, while in others it simply heightens public curiosity. This concept is echoed by the phrase, \\"there is no such thing as bad publicity\\". Belle √âpoque The Belle √âpoque ('beautiful era') in Paris, roughly from 1871‚Äì1914, was notable for many succ√®s de scandale. This was also where and when the term originated. In the examples below, artists started their careers with some sort of scandal, with some connection to turn-of-the-century Paris. In other cities, provoking a scandal appeared more risky, as Oscar Wilde found out shortly after his relatively \\"successful\\" Parisian scandal (Salom√© in 1894, portraying the main character as a necrophile). * Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe (\\"Luncheon on the Grass\\") by √âdouard Manet,Clare Brook. \\"Why BLUE needs a Succ√®s de Scandale\\" at presented at the Salon des refus√©s, 1863: Even the Emperor was scandalised ‚Äî but Manet had a nice start to his career. * Alfred Jarry shocked Paris in 1896 with the first of his absurdistic Ubu plays: Ubu Roi. The performance of this play was forbidden after the first night, though Jarry got around the prohibition by moving the production to a puppet theatre. *A new group of artists, labeled disrespectfully \\"Les Fauves\\" (\\"The Wild Beasts\\") by an art critic, had their successful debut in 1905 Paris (and kept the name). * Richard Strauss had little success with his first two operas, which today are no longer performed. He then tried something different: he set music to Wilde's Salom√© in 1905. It created a scandal, including in the New York Met, where the production had to be closed after one night. But Strauss wanted more, and his next opera, (Elektra, 1909) was so \\"noisy\\" that cartoons appeared with Strauss directing an orchestra of animals. However, the opera's libretto, written by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, was quite tame. *The 1912 ballet Afternoon of a Faun, choreographed and headed by Vaslav Nijinsky, provoked strong reactions. The newspaper Le Figaro wrote in a front-page review that the \\"movements are filthy and bestial in their eroticism\\".Le Figaro, 30 May 1912, \\"Un Faux Pas\\" Gaston Calmette editorial, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky, p.242. Buckle suggests Calmette was seeking to imply Nijinsky was showing bulging genitalia when seen in profile. Despite, or because of, this criticism, the ballet was sold-out in Paris. *The Rite of Spring (1913)Richard Taruskin. Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works Through Mavra, p. 1008 University of California Press, 1996. *The original 1917 production of the ballet Parade. *George Antheil's 1923 performance of futurist piano music at the Champs-√âlys√©es theater. *Paul Chabas had won a most prestigious prize with his September Morn in Paris in 1912. Nudity as portrayed in this painting was, however, far from shocking to Parisians half a century after D√©jeuner. The market value of the painting remained low. Then, Chabas put it on display in a New York shop window in 1913. There, for the first time in history, it appears a succ√®s de scandale scheme was set up by a publicity agent (Harry Reichenbach), who \\"accidentally\\" tipped off a morality crusader to the picture. The scandal that evolved brought financial success and secured Chabas's place in art history books. Although later deemed kitsch, the painting ended up in one of the most prestigious museums of New York. Other examples This was not the last time that Comstockery fanned the success it wanted to prohibit: \\"I expect it will be the making of me\\" said Mae West to the press in 1927, under arrest after the Society for the Suppression of Vice had maneuvered to get her play titled \\"Sex\\" re-censored by the Police Department Play Jury. A few years later, when she was over 40 years old, her sex-symbol status paid off when her 1935 film contract made her the highest- paid woman to date. Films qualified as succ√®s de scandale include Louis Malle's 1958 The Lovers,Ginette Vincendeau. \\"The Lovers: Succ√®s de scandale\\" at and Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 Last Tango in Paris.Patrick Duynslaegher. \\"Last Tango in Paris: Succ√®s de scandale\\" in Knack, 31 January 2011. Scandal also boosted the success of writers of modest talent.Isabelle de Courtivron. \\"The French Still Love a Succes de Scandale\\" in The New York Times. June 22, 1997 Even famous writers like Flaubert and Joyce have been described as deploying succ√®s de scandale recipes to their advantage.Val√©rie B√©n√©jam. \\"The Elliptical Adultery of Ulysses: A Flaubertian Recipe for Succ√®s de Scandale\\", pp. 76‚Äì93 in James Joyce and the Nineteenth-Century French Novel edited by Finn Fordham and Rita Sakr.

It was founded by Agostino Gabrino, the son of a merchant of Brescia to defend the Catholic Church against the expected Antichrist. The organization was accused by contemporaries of having political motives. Gabrino was responsible for two notable disruptions of church ceremonies in 1693. One occurred on Palm Sunday 1693, when Gabrino rushed the altar of St Peter's at Rome with a sword. He yelled Ego sum Rex Gloriae (\\"I am king of glory\\") as he attacked the altar, a response to the choir's chants of Quis est iste Rex Gloriae? (\\"Who was that king of Glory?\\"). He also disturbed public worship at the Church of the Holy Savior. Though Gabrino was treated as a madman and confined in a madhouse, the society flourished until one member, a woodcutter, denounced it to the Inquisition, leading to the arrest of eighty knights. Though chiefly mechanics, tradesmen and labourers, members always carried their swords, even when at work. They also wore a star on their breasts with seven rays, a tail, and surrounded by a golden thread forming a circle representing the globe. The tail of the star represented the sword seen by St. John in the Apocalypse. Gabrino styled himself monarch of the Holy Trinity. He was credited by his enemies with a desire to introduce polygamy and has been accused of an intended rebellion against the papal government. His knights were instructed to only marry pure virgins. A search of social media websites will reveal more than one contemporary order of chivalry which bears the name ‚ÄúKnights of the Apocalypse‚Äù and which claims to be carrying on the charism of Gabrino‚Äôs original organization.

Founded as the Graduate Society in 1965, it became a college in 2003 and was named after then-chancellor, Sir Peter Ustinov. Formerly at the Howlands Farm site at the top of Elvet Hill, in 2017 the college relocated to the Sheraton Park site in Neville's Cross. History Shincliffe Hall, former college accommodation In 1965, William Bayne Fisher, a professor in Durham University's geography department, founded the Graduate Society and in its inaugural year, the total membership was 94 students: 86 men and 8 women. As more than 50% of its members lived in private accommodation, it retained its status as a society for over 35 years. In this time, the society acquired more accommodation: the Parsons field site off Old Elvet consisted of Fisher House, the Parsons Field House, Fonteyn Court and the Parsons Field Court; Palatine House; Kepier House and Kepier Court, both at the top of Claypath; 29, 34 and 38 on Old Elvet and Shincliffe Hall in Shincliffe Village. Howland's Farm, home of Ustinov College 2005-2017 The society's accommodation has since then been gradually consolidated with the building of new accommodation at Howlands Farm in 1998, and on Dryburn Road in 2005. Since 1965, membership had increased to over 1500 and in 2003, the society was turned into a college and named in honour of the Chancellor of the University (1992‚Äì2004), Sir Peter Ustinov. The college's offices were moved from Old Elvet to the Howlands Farm site in September 2005. The college motto (Diversitate Valemus) was coined later that year by Zu'bi Al-Zu'bi, President of the GCR. The Parson's Field site at the end of Old Elvet, which had been the heart of the community during its years as the Graduate Society, was handed over to St Cuthbert's Society in 2005 and Palatine house was transferred to Hatfield College in 2006. In 2017, Ustinov College moved from Howlands Farm to Sheraton Park, originally built for Neville's Cross College in 1921 and vacated in 2004. Membership While Durham's other colleges accept postgraduates, Ustinov College admits them exclusively, and is less formal in its structure than the other colleges. There are reported to be over 100 nationalities represented in Ustinov College, including members from Thailand, Greece, the United States, Jordan and Nigeria. Graduate Common Room The Graduate Common Room (GCR) is the student community of Ustinov College and all student members of the college, whether living in or out, are eligible for membership. Historically, the postgraduate community (through its elected representatives, the House Committee) had a high degree of autonomy from college officers and was self-governing in many matters. Today, the GCR committee, made up of elected house representatives officers, represent students' views in meetings with the college officers. The GCR committee also organises many student social events such as regular formal dinners, parties, the annual Summer Ball and Ustinov Summer Barbecue. As well as this, the GCR oversees many clubs and societies within the college, and manages the college bar at Howlands Farm. The first college formal was held in late 2006. Academic community Graduate Common Room pool game Ustinov College is home to an academic community which enables students from departments across the university to engage each other in interdisciplinary dialogue. Current projects in Ustinov's academic community are the Cafe des Arts, Cafe Politique, Cafe Scientifique, Ustinov Seminar, and the Ustinov Intercultural Forum (UIF). In addition to this, a college scholarship is awarded in support of the Race, Crime and Justice Research Group which connects academics from across the north east of England.

He would sing and hum along to blues musicians such as Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters on the radio. At the age of four, Lee made his debut on the stage at a Baptist church, reciting a small poem about a red telephone. In the early 1950s, his parents separated as his father \\"refused or neglected to provide for her\\", the divorce petition states. Lee only remembered seeing his father three times during his entire life. Subsequently, Lee and his mother packed their things and took a train to California, while his father was at work. Lee and his mother resided in Los Angeles permanently in 1952. In 1953, their divorce was granted and his mother married Clinton Lee, a successful construction worker, on April 23, 1955. Lee was formally adopted by Clinton Lee on June 6, 1960, legally acquiring his surname, after filing for an adoption notice in 1958. His mother was able to resume her teaching career, enabling the family to buy a new home in the West Adams area of South Central Los Angeles. The neighborhood was also home to Johnny Echols, who attended the same schools as Lee and would later be the lead guitarist for Love. Lee attended Sixth Avenue Elementary School and excelled in athletics but was behind academically. Being known as \\"the toughest kid in the neighborhood\\", Lee was pressured into succeeding in school by his great aunt, a former school principal, but showed interest in sports, music, reading, and animals. Lee later attended Mount Vernon Junior High, where his interest in music would soon outweigh his focus on sports. Lee's first musical instrument was the accordion, which he took lessons in from a teacher. He adapted to reading music and developed a good ear and natural musical intelligence. While he was never formally taught about musical theory and composition, he was able to mimic musicians from records and compose his own songs. Eventually, he persuaded his parents to buy him an organ and harmonica. Graduating from Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Lee‚Äôs musical ambitions found opportunities between his local community and classmates. As opposed to attending a college under a sports scholarship, he strived for a musical career. His plan of forming a band was under the influence of Echols, after seeing him perform \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" with a five-piece band at a school assembly. Love Forever Changes sold moderately in its time (reaching #154 on the Top 200 albums, and stayed on the charts for 10 weeks, without the benefit of a hit single), although it reached the top 30 in the UK. Nonetheless, its cult status grew. In 2012, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Forever Changes 40th in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. It was entered into the National Recording Registry in May 2012. Prison In late 1996, Lee was sentenced to 12 years for the negligent discharge of a firearm. California's three strikes law meant Lee was forced to serve a prison term, having previously served two years in jail for arson, and having been charged with various drug, driving and assault offences. Lee denied that he had fired the gun, and visiting fan Doug Thomas who had denied involvement when the police responded later confessed to the deed. Lee was incompetently represented in court; a year-delayed analysis of a gunpowder residue test on him produced a negative result. Had he pleaded guilty, Lee would have been sentenced to nine months in jail but he fought the case and lost. With the charges enhanced on account of his prior felony conviction and coincidental accusations of domestic violence of the same time-frame, the court made an example of him: 12 years, 85 percent of time served: about 9 years. In prison Lee refused visitors and interviews. \\"I thought I would beat this case, so why would I want to broadcast it? This has been so humiliating to me.\\" Former bandmates Bryan MacLean and Ken Forssi both died while Lee was incarcerated, ending any speculation as to a full-fledged Love reunion. On December 12, 2001, Lee was released from prison, having served 5¬Ω years of his original sentence. A federal appeals court in California reversed the charge of negligent discharge of a firearm, as it found that the prosecutor at Lee's trial was guilty of misconduct. Final years In April 2006 it was publicly announced that Lee was being treated for acute myeloid leukemia. A tribute fund was set up shortly after the announcement, with a series of benefit concerts to be performed to help pay medical bills. The most notable of these concerts was produced by Steve Weitzman of SW Productions at New York's Beacon Theater on June 23, 2006, and featured Robert Plant, Ian Hunter, Ryan Adams, Nils Lofgren, Yo La Tengo, Garland Jeffreys, Johnny Echols (Love's original lead guitarist), and Flashy Python & The Body Snatchers (featuring Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah). Backed by Ian Hunter's band, Plant performed 12 songs, including four Led Zeppelin songs and five recorded by Love in the 60s (\\"7 and 7 Is\\", \\"A House Is Not A Motel\\", \\"Bummer in the Summer\\", \\"Old Man\\", and \\"Hey Joe\\"). A benefit concert was held in Dublin, Ireland. Death Lee underwent several months of treatment for leukemia, including chemotherapy and an experimental stem cell transplant using stem cells from an umbilical cord blood donor. His condition continued to worsen, and he died from complications of the disease in Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of 61. Legacy Robyn Hitchcock's 1993 song \\"The Wreck of the Arthur Lee\\" from the Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians album Respect was written as a tribute to the singer. Arthur Lee is mentioned in the song \\"Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken\\", by Lloyd Cole & the Commotions, as well as in the song \\"Mate of the Bloke\\", by Half Man Half Biscuit. His prison term is the subject of \\"The Prison's Going Down\\" by ex-Stranglers singer and guitarist Hugh Cornwell. Lee is the subject of the song \\"Byrds Turn to Stone\\" (originally titled \\"Mr Lee\\") by Liverpool band (and former Arthur Lee backing group) Shack. Rival Schools and Quicksand frontman Walter Schreifels paid tribute to Arthur Lee on his 2010 solo album An Open Letter to the Scene with a track titled \\"Arthur Lee's Lullaby\\". The 2009 Communion album by the Swedish band The Soundtrack of Our Lives features a song entitled \\"The Fan Who Wasn't There\\" which was based on a conversation singer Ebbot Lundberg had with Lee. Directors Mike Kerry and Chris Hall managed to persuade Arthur Lee to cooperate in the making of a UK documentary film Love Story (2006), successfully recording the last interviews with a reflective Arthur Lee, before he was diagnosed with leukemia. The film shows interviews with key individuals from some of the line-ups of Love and Elektra management and studio engineers.‚ÄòLove Story‚Äô 2006 Documentary, dirs Mike Kerry & Chris Hall https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814199/?ref_=ttco_co_tt Rapper Mac Miller covered Lee's 1972 song \\"Everybody's Gotta Live\\" on his posthumous sixth studio album Circles (2020), on the song \\"Everybody.\\" \\"Everybody's Gotta Live\\" was featured in the 2019 film Jojo Rabbit, and is also on the soundtrack.

He stands out as a devout Christian who founded the first abbey in Sweden and acted harshly against pagan practices. The kingdom was still an unstable realm based on alliances of noblemen, and Inge's main power base was in V√§sterg√∂tland and √ñsterg√∂tland; one of the earliest chronicles that mention his reign knows him as rex gautorum, King of the Geats.Peter Sawyer, N√§r Sverige blev Sverige. Alings√•s: Viktoria, 1991, p. 37. Biography Inge was the son of the former King Stenkil and a Swedish princess. Inge shared the rule of the kingdom with his probably elder brother Halsten Stenkilsson,The article Inge in Nordisk familjebok (1910).The Saga of Herv√∂r and Heithrek, in Stories and Ballads of the Far Past, translated from the Norse (Icelandic and Faroese), by N. Kershaw.Cambridge at the University Press, 1921. but little is known with certainty of Inge's reign. According to the contemporary chronicler Adam of Bremen and the writer of his scholion, the former king Stenkil had died and two kings named Eric had ruled and been killed. Then an Anund G√•rdske was summoned from Kievan Rus', but rejected due to his refusal to administer the bl√≥ts at the Temple at Uppsala. A hypothesis suggests that Anund and Inge were the same person, as several sources mention Inge as a fervent Christian. All that can be said is that a H√•kan the Red ruled in c. 1075 (when Adam concluded his chronicle) and that Inge was enthroned under unknown circumstances shortly before 1080.The Westrogothic law gives H√•kan a reign of 13 winters (Mats G. Larsson, G√∂tarnas riken. Uppt√§cktsf√§rder till Sveriges enande. Stockholm: Atlantis, 2002, p. 158, 184). If he governed (parts of) Sweden after Stenkil's death, as indicated by the Norse sources, his reign would have ended in c. 1079. This year is sometimes taken as the start of Inge I's reign (Philip Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden 1130-1290. Leiden: Brill, 2007, p. 590). In a letter to Inge from Pope Gregory VII, from 1080, he is called \\"king of the Swedes\\", but in a later letter probably dated to 1081, to Inge and another king \\"A\\" (either his brother Halsten or H√•kan the RedInge in Nationalencyklopedin), they are called kings of the West Geats.The article Inge d.√§. in Nationalencyklopedin. Whether this difference reflects a change in territory is not certain since the two letters concern the spreading of Christianity in Sweden and the paying of tithe to the Pope. = The rise of Blot-Sweyn and the expulsion of Inge = In perhaps the early 1080s,The years of the brief reign of Blot-Sweyn are sometimes given as 1084-1087 or, alternatively, 1080/81-1083/84 (Detlef Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, Marburg 1978-85, Bd. II). Inge was forced to abdicate by the Swedes over his disrespect for old traditions and his refusal to administer the pagan custom of the bl√≥t. King Blot-Sweyn (Svein the Sacrifier) was thus elected king. The Hervarar saga describes the rise of Sweyn, the abdication and how Inge was exiled in V√§sterg√∂tland: However, Inge returned after three winters to kill Blot-Sweyn and reclaim the throne: A similar story also appears in the Orkneyinga saga, but in this account, Sweyn stays indoors and is burnt to death: In V√§sterg√∂tland, Inge lived, according to later tradition, at Bjurum near present-day Falk√∂ping.\\"H√•ngers kyrkoruin\\", http://wadbring.com/historia/undersidor/hanger.htm An Icelandic skald named Mark√∫s Skeggjason was one of his court poets, according to Sk√°ldatal. Mark√∫s was later the lawspeaker of Iceland from 1084. It has been suggested that the details about Inge and Blot-Sweyn in the Norse literature are derived from him. In that case Blot-Sweyn's short reign would fall in the early years of the 1080s. According to the Westrogothic law, Inge ruled Sweden with virility and he never broke the laws that had been accepted in the districts. = Later years = Modern statue depicting the meeting of the three kings in 1101 at Kungah√§lla Around 1100, Inge and Queen Helena founded Vreta Abbey near present-day Link√∂ping in √ñsterg√∂tland.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Vreta klosters √§ldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 318-26. The abbey housed Sweden's first nunnery and is one of the oldest in Scandinavia. The abbey belonged to the Benedictine order and was founded on the orders of Pope Paschal II. As a step in the preparation of a Nordic archbishopric in Lund in Denmark, a list of Swedish sees and provinces was drawn up in c. 1100 which gives an idea about Inge's realm. The sees (Nomina ciuitatum in suethia) are given as Scara, Lionga, Kaupinga, Tuna, Strigin, Sigituna, and Arosa. Of these, Scara and Sigituna are easily identified as Skara and Sigtuna; these are also mentioned by Adam of Bremen as seats for bishops. Lionga and Strigin are probably Link√∂ping and Str√§ngn√§s, while the others are harder to identify. These might have been places with a substantial Christian population, rather than stable administrative units. Meanwhile, the provinces or \\"islands\\" (Nomina insularum, de regno sueuorum) are Gothica australis (√ñsterg√∂tland), Gothica occidentalis (V√§sterg√∂tland), Guasmannia (V√§stmanland), Sundermannia (S√∂dermanland), Nerh (N√§rke), Tindia (Tiundaland), Fedundria (Fj√§drundaland), Atanht (Attundaland), Guthlandia (Gotland), Guarandia (V√§rend), Findia (Finland or Finnveden), Hestia (Estonia), Helsingia (Helsingland), Guarmelande (V√§rmland), and Teuste (Tjust).Tore Nyberg, \\"Adam av Bremen och Florenslistan\\", Scandia 57:2, 1991, pp. 166-79. The inclusion of Estonia, and possibly Finland, may point to missionary influences or ambitions, rather than indicating that these areas belonged to Inge's kingdom. It is, nevertheless, known that Inge married one of his daughters to a Prince of Novgorod, pointing at an active dynastic policy in eastern direction.Dick Harrison, \\"Inge den √§ldre\\", Nationalencyklopedin About this time Inge and the Norwegian king Magnus Barefoot were at war, since Magnus coveted the province Dalsland. A Norwegian fortification was built at K√•llands√∂ in Lake V√§nern. However, Inge marched a strong army over the ice in the winter, and forced the garrison to surrender. Some time later Magnus invaded western Sweden with fresh troops, but was attacked by Inge at Fuxarne. The Geats drove the Norwegian army from the field and Magnus barely escaped with his life.Magnus Barefoot's Saga ; Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike, Book XIII, http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Niels However, in 1101 the war came to an end with a peace agreement concluded at Kungah√§lla together with king Eric Evergood of Denmark. Eric had spent time in exile in Sweden before his enthronement, and therefore probably had good relations with the House of Stenkil.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike, Book XII, http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Olaf_Hunger At this meeting Inge gave his daughter Margareta as wife to king Magnus, with Dalsland as dowry. In Snorri's Magnus Barefoot's Saga, a part of the Heimskringla, there is a description of the appearance of Inge: = Death = Drawing by Erik Dahlberg of the gravestone on King Ingi's cenotaph at Varnhem Abbey The Hervarar saga tells that Inge died of old age and that he ruled until his death. The exact date of his death is not known, but his successor Philip (d. 1118) is said to have ruled \\"briefly\\". Since the province of J√§mtland went over to the Norwegian king in 1111, it might mean that the forceful Inge was dead by the time, and that his weak successors were unable to maintain his realm. He may therefore have died around 1110.Nils Ahnlund, \\"Vreta klosters √§ldsta donatorer\\", Historisk tidskrift 65, 1945, p. 316. 15th-century Swedish historical tradition has it that Inge waged war successfully with Denmark, occupied Sk√•ne for three years, and was then murdered in his bed by unspecified assailants. This is partly gainsaid by older sources, however. According to later local tradition, Inge was originally buried in a small church at Bjurum, but his remains were later moved to another location. There is also a gravstone for him in a deserted churchyard at H√•nger and a special cenotaph among other royal grave chapels at Varnhem Abbey.Lagerqvist in Sverige och dess regenter under 1000 √•r p 44 Inge's actual grave is most likely a set of remains found in Vreta Abbey in a section of the abbey church that was erected by Inge's son Ragnvald.G√∂ran Tagesson (2007).

All skeletons that are likely to be that of Inge are very tall, about two meters in length, suggesting that Snorri's description was accurate. Family King Inge was married to Helena. Together with Helena, Inge founded the monastery of Vreta. Inge's son, Ragnvald, died before he could succeed his father on the throne. Inge was succeeded by his two nephews, Philip Halstensson and Inge the Younger, who were the sons of his elder brother Halsten Stenkilsson. King Inge and Helena were the parents of four children: *Christina, married Prince Mstislav I of Novgorod, later Grand Duke of Kiev. *Ragnvald, father of Ingrid Ragnvaldsdotter.

He was educated in medicine and law at the University of Edinburgh and in London, respectively. After passing the bar, he practiced law in London for several years. He stayed in London during the Revolutionary War, representing the colonies to Britain and France and also serving as an American spy to track their activities. After his return to Virginia, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress. Life Born at Stratford Hall, Virginia, Arthur Lee was the youngest son of Hon. Thomas Lee (1690‚Äì1750) and Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701‚Äì1750). Three of his five surviving elder brothers, Richard Henry Lee (1732‚Äì1794), Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734‚Äì1797) and William Lee (1739‚Äì1795), also became Revolutionary-era diplomats.

During the latter period, Lee wrote in 1764, \\"An Essay in Vindication of the Continental Colonies of America,\\" one of his more noted works. He opposed the Townshend acts and became a major proponent of American resistance to the British. After this work, he was granted membership to the American Philosophical Society through his election in 1768.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, 3:272‚Äì283. He studied law in London, passing the bar, and practising there from 1770 to 1776. During this time in London, Lee wrote many influential pamphlets and essays opposing slaveryGary B. Nash, The Unknown American Revolution (New York: Viking Penguin, 2008) pp. 114‚Äì115 and British continental policies. In 1770, Lee in London was named as the Massachusetts correspondent to Britain and France. He began corresponding with Samuel Adams, which began a long friendship. They probably did not meet personally until sometime after 1780. Lee met Benjamin Franklin while he was in London, where Franklin was negotiating on behalf of Pennsylvania interests. Lee criticized Franklin's extravagant lifestyle and told Sam Adams he would never be a good negotiator between a free people and a tyrant. In May 1776, he was a guest at the dinner organized by James Boswell that brought together Samuel Johnson, an ardent opponent of the American colonists' cause, and John Wilkes, one of its most prominent British supporters. During the American Revolution, the Continental Congress appointed Lee as its envoy to Spain and Prussia, but his success was at best mixed. Later, in Paris, after Lee helped negotiate the Treaty of Alliance (1778) with France, he fell out with Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane. He persuaded Congress to recall Deane to America, but he was himself recalled soon afterward. In addition to his diplomatic duties, Lee was arguably one of America's first spies. He gathered information in France and Britain. He also successfully identified Edward Bancroft, secretary to the American legation in Paris, as a British spy. After Lee returned to Virginia, the state in 1782 sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. The same year he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1790, Arthur Lee purchased Lansdowne from Robert Wormeley III. This fine mansion still stands in Urbanna, a small waterfront town on Virginia's Middle Peninsula. It is presently a private residence. Lee died at Urbanna in 1792 and was buried in the rear garden with no stone. He never married and had no children. Plans to reinter him at Stratford Hall never came about. Lansdowne was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Ancestry Coat of Arms of Arthur Lee Arthur Lee was the son of Colonel Thomas Lee, Hon. (1690‚Äì1750) of Stratford Hall Plantation, Westmoreland County, Virginia. Thomas married Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701‚Äì1750), the daughter of Colonel Philip Ludwell II (1672‚Äì1726) of Green Spring Plantation, and Hannah Harrison (1679‚Äì1731). Arthur's father, Thomas, was the son of Colonel Richard Lee II, Esq., known as \\"Richard the Scholar\\" (1647‚Äì1715) and Laetitia Corbin (c. 1657 ‚Äì 1706). Richard Lee II, was the son of Col. Richard Lee I, Esq., known as \\"The Immigrant\\" (1618‚Äì1664) and Anne Constable (c. 1621 ‚Äì 1666). Arthur's paternal grandmother, Laetitia, was the daughter of the Lees' neighbor and councillor (attorney), Hon. Henry Corbin, Sr. (1629‚Äì1676) and Alice (Eltonhead) Burnham (c. 1627 ‚Äì 1684). Arthur's paternal great-grandmother, Anne, was the daughter of Thomas Constable; she became a ward of Sir John Thoroughgood.

Founded in 1965, it takes its name from William Van Mildert, Prince-Bishop of Durham from 1826 to 1836 and a leading figure in the University's 1832 foundation. Originally an all-male college, it became the first Durham college to become co-educational in 1972 with the admission of female undergraduates. The college occupies grounds of eight acres (32,000 m¬≤) alongside South Road and is centred on a small lake. The college's accommodation and communal facilities are modern and spacious, and includes an adjacent conference centre which is regularly used by external organisations. History and buildings A view of the main building and lake at Van Mildert College in 1971 Van Mildert College was established in 1965 following recommendations of the Robbins Report looking into the future of higher education in the UK. In 1963, the University of Newcastle was officially established as a separate entity from the University of Durham, meaning new colleges were required to meet the new university places that the Government wished to create. As a result, the university planned to establish three new colleges on Elvet Hill and these went on to be named Collingwood College, Trevelyan College and Van Mildert College. Women postgraduate students were first admitted in 1967, studying Certificates in Education. Female undergraduates were first admitted to the college in 1972, making it the first Durham college to become co-educational. The accommodation blocks are named Tyne, Tees, Middleton, Derwent, Wear, Tunstall and Deerness, the latter two of which are fully en suite. These are named after local rivers (River Tyne, River Tees, River Derwent, River Wear, River Deerness), a town (Tunstall) and an architect (Middleton). They are all situated within the college grounds, and the university is in the process of refurbishing each of the buildings in turn. In total the College can provide 550 single rooms for its members. =Dining Hall= The college's Dining Hall is the largest student dining hall in the UK. It measures 30.8m by 13.2m and can seat approximately 350 members at Formal dinners. The dining hall is used for a variety of functions over the academic year and plays a central role in the lives of livers in (students who live on the college site) as it is where college meals and formals are held. The hall also acts as a venue for drama productions, has use as a sports hall and in 2010 was one of the main locations for the Inter-Varsity Folk Dance Festival. A copy of a portrait of William Van Mildert, whom the college is named after, hangs at one end of Van Mildert dining hall, along with portraits of the former Principals and Masters of the College. =Library= The College library is well equipped with over 12,000 books & journals and, along with St John's College Archives, is the only other College library in Durham to be listed in The National Archives. Opposite the library is the Kent Room, which is where the library's fiction collection is kept. The library is run by a part-time librarian and the library committee of the JCR, which also provides much of the funding to maintain the library. The library has recently undergone a process of automating its catalogue of books. =Bar and Junior Common Room= Van Mildert has a recently refurbished bar which is extensively used by members of the college, as well as by students from other colleges. It is also generally used for holding JCR meetings during term time. In recent years, the college bar has won the 'University Bar' category of the Best Bar None awards for Durham City for the 2008‚Äì09 and 2010‚Äì11 academic years. Most recently, Van Mildert Bar won the 'Gold' category for the Best Bar None Awards for the year 2016-17. The Bar is currently run by Sabbatical Bar Steward (Cellarman) James Smith. The Junior Common Room is used for many of the social events that are organised by the JCR. For example, bops, entertainment after Formal dinners, band nights and amateur theatre productions. Both rooms have large plasma screen TVs which are used to show major sporting fixtures during the academic term. =Other facilities= The College has a host of other social facilities, including a music/recording suite with drums, grand piano and recording equipment. The College also has a gym, computer room, shop, tennis court and a full-size snooker table. =Arms= The shield of Van Mildert College The college arms are blazoned as \\"Gules two Scythe blades in saltire in chief the Cross of St Cuthbert Argent And for the Crest On a Wreath of the Colours in front of a Castle of three Towers Sable a silver penannular brooch proper the ends charged with Gilded Crosses of St Cuthbert.\\" The scythes and the red field are taken from Bishop Van Mildert's episcopal arms; the cross of St Cuthbert is a common emblem of Durham City and University. The college generally uses only the shield of its arms for most purposes. Student life =Common Rooms= All members of college are members of a common room. Undergraduates are members of the Junior Common Room . The JCR elects an Executive Committee which ensures the successful running of the JCR, in conjunction with the College Officers. The governance procedure of the JCR is stated in the constitution, which can only be amended by resolution of the JCR members during general meetings. Undergraduates constitute the majority of the student population of the college, 972 students in 2012/13. Until 2018 the Junior Common Room of Van Mildert College had a 236 page Constitution, making it significantly longer than the Constitutions of most sovereign states. Postgraduate students are members of the Middle Common Room (MCR) which hosts its own events and benefits from a refurbished Common Room and separate accommodation in Deerness block. All rooms in this block are en-suite and have access to kitchen facilities due to the fact that postgraduate students are often resident in college outside of normal term times. Postgraduate members of the college are entitled to make use of all the JCR facilities available. Administrative, academic and other members of college are members of the Senior Common Room (SCR). =Arts= The college has a number of groups involved in music, art, and the performing arts, collectively known as 'Van MildARTS'. The college hosts an annual arts week and annual musical, with recent productions being Cabaret, Our Country's Good, Guys and Dolls, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Rent. The college has a Big Band, Dance Society and Jam Society. This Society organises Jam by the Lake, the only open-air musical festival in County Durham and frequent winner of Purple Radio's 'Best Music Event' award. =Sports= The college has a strong sporting profile, finishing 1st in the college league table in 2008/9. There are a number of sports teams, notably eight successful male football teams and two male rugby teams. However, Van Mildert also excels in less traditional sports such as Cheerleading, with the College team having won the Inter- Collegiate Competition for five consecutive years; Ultimate Frisbee; and Women's Rugby (a joint team with Josephine Butler College). Awards for graduating sports players are given at the Annual Sports Formal. This event celebrates the work and success of the sports teams, but more so the JCR Members who captain the teams and make up their Executive Committees. Boat Club Van Mildert Boat Club is the college rowing club. It was founded in 1965 by Simon Scott, an Engineering undergraduate at Durham University and one of the founding members of Van Mildert College. The boathouse of the club is on the River Wear, opposite Dunelm House and below Kingsgate Bridge. The club competes against other college clubs in intercollegiate competitions organised by Durham College Rowing. It also takes part in regional events and national events (such as Head of the River Race, Women's Eights Head of the River Race and BUCS Regatta). =Outreach= High Table at the Mildert Day Formal Meal in 2008 One of the most notable aspects of Van Mildert's College is its passion for Community Outreach. Over recent years, six projects have been set up to provide support to a range of groups in the community. This includes visiting local young offenders (Secure Centre Mentoring Scheme), engaging with young children and teenagers (Primary School Project and Young Peoples' Project), visiting and building relationships with the local elderly community (Community Visiting Scheme); or working as respite carers for the families of young disabled children (Carers Respite Committee). The latest outreach project, Environmental Conservation Committee helps to raise the profile of sustainability by visiting rehabilitation centres, schools and recreational areas. These projects cumulatively raise over ¬£15,000 each year to function. This is through a range of methods, but mainly through hosting large-scale College events such as Mildert Would I Lie To You? and Van Mildert Take Me Out. =Academic dress= At Van Mildert the undergraduate academic gown is not required to be worn to formal events nor at Matriculation, instead formal dress is used. In addition, students wear black tie attire at the end of term balls. =Formals= Formals take place regularly during the academic term, with the college holding between three and five per term. As with all colleges there are a number of traditions at Formals, such as pennying and odds on. Students are not required to wear academic dress to formal dinners, instead formal dress is worn except when it is a Ball and dinner jackets are worn. At the end of the dining hall a High Table consisting of members of the SCR and their guests are present at every formal. The principal's entrance and exit, announced to attendees by the ringing of the election bell by the JCR President, signifies the official opening and closing of the formal meal. Food at a formal meal usually consists of three courses and is often followed by evening entertainment. =The Kazu= Kazu being performed The Kazu is a traditional ceremony performed by the winning candidate after elections to the JCR Executive Committee, following the announcement of results by the JCR Chair. In more recent years, it has only been the elected President that performs a Kazu. A Kazu is a celebratory action which requires the winning candidate of every election to kick a full can of Coca-Cola down the stairs in the foyer, throw it over their head three times and then opening the can over their head. The JCR Standing Orders and website note that it \\"may be done wearing clothes\\" and that \\"wikipedia knows more about Kazus than anyone in College\\". The tradition is thought to stem from a Japanese exchange student visiting Durham from Teikyo University who regularly completed the act in the 1996/1997 academic year.  Associated Institutions  Following the tradition of Oxbridge Colleges being twinned with each other, as of 2012 Van Mildert College has been twinned with Halifax College, University of York. People associated with Van Mildert  = Principal = David Harper is the current Principal of the College, a palaeontologist and former Professor of Palaeontology in the University of Copenhagen. The following list is of the past Masters & Principals of the College: * Arthur Prowse (1964‚Äì1972) * Paul Kent (1972‚Äì1982) * Arnold Bradshaw (1983‚Äì1988) * Judy Turner (1989‚Äì1999) * Ian Taylor (1999‚Äì2000) * George Patterson (2000‚Äì2004) * Patrick O'Meara (2004‚Äì2011) * David Harper (2011‚Äìpresent) = Fellows = The college has two fellowships for visiting scholars; the Arthur Prowse Fellowship, named after the College's first Master, and the Arnold Bradshaw Fellowship. The fellowships are typically awarded for one academic term in conjunction with the Institute of Advanced Study with the fellow residing in the College and becoming a member of the SCR. Recent fellows have included Adi Ophir and Mikhail Epstein. =Notable alumni= Van Mildert alumni are active through organisations and events, such as the Van Mildert Association, which cater for the more than 7,500 living alumni.

After their first demo, lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and guitarist Clint Lowery joined the group. Following a few name changes, the members settled on the name Sevendust and released their self-titled debut album on April 15, 1997, which sold only 310 copies in its first week but ultimately achieved gold certification through touring and support from their label, TVT Records. Since formation, Sevendust have attained success with three consecutive RIAA gold- certified albums, a Grammy nomination, and have sold millions of records worldwide. The group has released a total of twelve studio albums, including a reissue of their debut as Sevendust: Definitive Edition, which contains five new tracks and a DVD. History =Early years and Sevendust (1994‚Äì1998)= In 1994, bassist Vince Hornsby joined drummer Morgan Rose in a band called Snake Nation. John Connolly, a drummer at the time, joined the group as guitarist. They recorded their first demo, but were displeased with the lead vocals and hired Lajon Witherspoon following a yearlong search. Clint Lowery joined the band, and the group renamed themselves Rumblefish. Guitarist Clint Lowery in 1998. Lowery is one of Sevendust's primary songwriters. Rumblefish were forced to rename themselves after discovering another band with the same name. They chose Crawlspace, and released \\"My Ruin\\" on the 1996 compilation album Mortal Kombat: More Kombat through TVT Records. However, the band had to change their name again after another group named Crawlspace sent notice that they wanted $2,500 in exchange for the naming rights. The band members elected to rename themselves Sevendust, inspired by the commercial insecticide brand \\"Sevin Dust\\". The song \\"Rumble Fish\\" was included on the band's second album, Home. Sevendust released their self-titled debut, with partial production by former Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French, on April 15, 1997, known for its heavy riffs, angry vocals and thrash-like drumming, as in the songs \\"Black\\" and \\"Bitch\\". Henderson, Alex. [ \\"Sevendust\\" review]. Allmusic \\"Black\\" became the opening song for nearly every Sevendust concert until 2004. The debut album also contains the song \\"My Ruin\\", from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack. Sevendust appeared on the Billboard 200, remained there for sixteen weeks and peaked at 165 on April 4, 1998. The album went gold on May 19, 1999. In 1998, Sevendust performed at Dynamo Open Air (May 29‚Äì31) and Ozzfest 1998 (July through August). In the same year they released a compilation called Live and Loud which featured live footage of the band's performance of September 16, 1998 at Chicago's Metro. =Home and Animosity (1999‚Äì2002)= On August 24, 1999, they released their second album, Home. The album peaked at 19 on the Billboard 200 and featured Skin from Skunk Anansie and Chino Moreno from Deftones as guest vocalists. The two singles from the album, \\"Denial\\" and \\"Waffle\\", gave the band moderate chart success, and the latter of which was played on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien show. They appeared in Woodstock 1999 and have toured with many bands such as Korn, Staind, Nonpoint, Reveille, Godsmack, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Powerman 5000, Creed, Kid Rock, Machine Head, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and Metallica. In 1999, they gained European exposure by opening for Skunk Anansie at various shows in Germany. Skin from Skunk Anansie provided guest vocals on the track \\"Licking Cream\\" off Home. They also opened with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent for Metallica on New Year's Eve in 1999 at the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, Michigan. They also joined Slipknot, Coal Chamber and other bands on the Tattoo the Earth Tour in June 2000. Also in 2000, the song \\"Fall\\" was recorded by producer Sylvia Massy in 1998 at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. \\"Fall\\" appears on the soundtrack to the film Scream 3. In November 2001, the band released their third album, Animosity. This album went gold and gained the band commercial success thanks to the success of singles \\"Praise\\" and \\"Angel's Son\\", which peaked at 15 and 11, respectively, on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. In 2002, they covered \\"Break the Walls Down\\", the theme song for professional wrestler Chris Jericho for the WWF Forceable Entry album. The song was never used as an official entry theme for him though. \\"Angel's Son\\" was a tribute to Lynn Strait, the lead singer of the band Snot, whom the members of Sevendust were friends with. Strait had died in a car accident in 1998. In addition to being included on Animosity, the song was included on the compilation album Strait Up. The band made an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman playing an acoustic version of \\"Angel's Son\\" featuring Paul Shaffer on keyboards. In the same year Sevendust was seen in the Chris Rock movie Down to Earth as a partial clip of \\"Waffle\\" is played. Another friend of the band, Dave Williams, the lead singer of Drowning Pool, died in 2002. Tragedy would strike again when Lajon Witherspoon's younger brother was shot and killed later that year. Due to his death, Sevendust went on hiatus in 2002. = Seasons, Clint Lowery's departure and Next (2003‚Äì2005) = In 2003, Sevendust returned with their fourth album, Seasons. The album debuted at No. 14 in the US, selling around 68,000 copies in its first week. This was one of the band's best received albums and to date features their highest charting single (tied with \\"Driven\\"), \\"Enemy\\", which peaked at No. 10 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. \\"Enemy\\" was made the official theme song for WWE Unforgiven 2003. Other singles released from the album, \\"Broken Down\\" and \\"Face to Face\\", met with more moderate success charting at 20 and 22, respectively. In 2004, for the first time in the band's career, they released a live album on a CD/DVD double disk package titled Southside Double-Wide: Acoustic Live. Both the CD and the DVD include a cover of \\"Hurt\\" by Nine Inch Nails which is dedicated to Johnny Cash. This concert showcased a mellower side to the band with an acoustic performance. On December 11, 2004, after playing a show in Columbus, Ohio, it was announced that Clint Lowery had left the band mid-tour, because he wanted to play with his brother Corey Lowery in his new band Dark New Day, who had reportedly just signed with Warner Bros. Records. A temporary guitarist was found for the rest of the dates, and Lowery was eventually replaced by Sonny Mayo (from Snot and Amen). At roughly the same time, Sevendust and TVT Records parted ways. On October 11, 2005, Sevendust joined forces with good friend Producer/Engineer Shawn Grove and released their fifth studio album, Next, on the WineDark Records label, distributed by Universal Music. In the process, Sevendust also created their own record label, 7Bros Records. The album was actually recorded in a private house-turned-studio owned by a couple outside of the band's hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where Creed had recorded the Weathered record. The first radio single off \\"Next\\" was the track \\"Ugly\\", released to radio August 9, 2005, followed by the music video. The track \\"Pieces\\" appeared on the soundtrack for the film Saw II.Loftus, Johnny. [ \\"Saw 2\\" ‚Äì Overview]. Allmusic Next debuted at No. 20 in the US, selling around 37,000 copies in its first week. Not much longer after the release of Next, Sevendust's former label TVT Records released a greatest hits package for Sevendust, titled Best of (Chapter One 1997-2004), the label's final Sevendust release.[ Allmusic ((( Best of Sevendust (Chapter One 1997‚Äì2004) > Overview )))] Also, an unofficial video for \\"Hero\\" was released showing footage of Bruce Lee in many of his famous film roles. A few months after the October 2005 release date of Next, though, it became clear that WineDark would not live up to the band's expectations. \\"I had people come up to me and say, 'When is the record coming out?' And it had already been out for five months\\", Rose grumbles. \\"Basically, the main person that was in charge of the whole thing fell off the face of the earth. There were no more cheques coming in, and the money had not been paid in full.\\" = Alpha, Chapter VII: Hope & Sorrow and Clint Lowery's return (2006‚Äì2008) = In early 2006, the band themselves were considered bankrupt. WineDark Records had imploded, leaving them without distribution, tour support, or promised advance payments. The band owed money to crew members and other staffers and had a mounting credit card debt. In April, they expected that a tax refund from the US government would help ease the burden. Then, they found out their accountant hadn't paid their taxes and they owed $120,000 to the government. \\"We were beyond broke\\", says drummer and lyricist Morgan Rose. \\"We had a debt load close to a million dollars, and we were in a position where, no matter how much money we thought we were making, we were still having to pay and pay.\\" Sevendust (with Shawn Grove again serving as producer and engineer), released their sixth full-length studio album, entitled Alpha, on March 6, 2007. The album debuted at No. 14 in the US, the band's highest chart position yet, selling over 42,000 copies of the album in its first week of sale. The disc contained the album's preceding internet track \\"Deathstar\\", the Hot Mainstream Rock top 10 smash \\"Driven\\" and a further Active Rock radio top 40 hit in the form of \\"Beg to Differ\\".

They entered Architekt Music studios in Butler, New Jersey with engineer Mike Ferretti. Sevendust has completed recording its ninth album for an early 2013 release. In October 2012 interview, Lowery described the album as \\"...a basic Sevendust record\\", stating \\"There's nothing, like, too completely different than anything we've done before. It's got a darker vibe to it. We've got a good amount of the programming element in there. It's a lot of what we do. it's heavy and it's got its melodic element in it\\". Additionally, he discussed the possibility of touring in early 2013 with Lacuna Coil. Lowery later confirmed the album's title to be Black Out the Sun as well. Sevendust announced they will release the album on their own 7Bros. Records label (through Warner Music Group's Independent Label Group) on March 26, 2013. The album's debut single, \\"Decay\\" was released to radio and retail outlets on January 22, 2013.

He also shared that the band plans to release a live DVD with both standard and acoustic concerts as well as a historical retrospective of the band for an early 2015 release. Guitarist John Connolly confirmed on his Facebook page that the live DVD recording was on hiatus due to business decisions and would likely be something the band would still pursue. =Kill the Flaw (2015‚Äì2017)= In February 2015, Sevendust entered the studio to begin recording their new album. It was reported that the band had finished recording their new album in late March 2015.

The tour marked the band's first trip down under in six years after their slated 2014 Soundwave Festival appearance was controversially cancelled.

Musical style and influences Sevendust has played genres like heavy metal, alternative metal, nu metal, and hard rock. Guitarist John Connolly was asked what the band defined their genre as. Connolly said: > \\"I don't know. I've been trying to figure that out. It was back in the day. > People, for five minutes called us progressive, and then it was nu-metal. > Then, all of a sudden, we were playing alternative metal. We are some kind > of heavy and some kind of rock and some kind of metal.\\" According to AllMusic, Sevendust became one of the rising acts in late 1990s heavy metal with an aggressive blend of bottom-heavy riffs and soulful, accessible melodies. The band's lead singer, Lajon Witherspoon, has been praised for his soulful vocals. Mark Jenkins of Washington Post states, \\"Witherspoon is more flexible than most heavy-rock vocalists, capable of lilting as convincingly as he growls.\\" Ultimate Guitar mentioned, \\"He has a fairly distinct voice for metal, which originally helped the band stand out\\". A major part of the Sevendust sound has always been guitar player Clint Lowery. He is the main contributor to the band's style and sound and is known for his raw melodies and empowering riffs. Lowery incorporates ultra-low baritone tunings, and creative 6-string tunings. Sevendust's influences include Metallica, Anthrax, Testament, Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Van Halen, Steve Vai, Iron Maiden, Ronnie James Dio, Nine Inch Nails, and Suicidal Tendencies. Frontman Lajon Witherspoon said he is influenced by \\"so many\\" genres of music, \\"from R&B;, to rock, to jazz, and classical.\\" Witherspoon then said he is \\"influenced by everything.\\" Other projects Clint Lowery and Morgan Rose started a separate band called Call Me No One. They released an album, Last Parade released on June 5, 2012. John Connolly and bassist Vinnie Hornsby have joined forces with Alter Bridge and Creed drummer Scott Phillips and former Submersed guitarist Eric Friedman to form a separate band called Projected. They released their debut album, Human, on September 18, 2012, and a follow-up album, Ignite My Insanity, July 21, 2017. Other appearances On September 16, 2010, Sevendust filmed a video for \\"Falcons on Top\\", the official theme song of the Atlanta Falcons football team. Written by Joel Wanasek of JTW Studios.

It is the University's second largest collegiate body, with over 1000 students. The co-educational college was formed in 1975 following the merger of two much older single-sex institutions, the College of the Venerable Bede for men and St Hild's College for women. Hild Bede is neither a Bailey nor a Hill college, and is situated on the banks of the River Wear between Durham's 'peninsula' and Gilesgate. History The College of the Venerable Bede, for men, was founded in 1838 with a small number of trainee schoolmasters. The college was expanded greatly over the next few decades with the assistance of trade unionist and future local MP William Crawford, who would later become the college's treasurer. Its sister institution, St Hild's College, was opened for the education of women on an adjacent site in 1858. Both colleges initially specialised in teacher training but in 1892 for Bede and 1896 for Hild they became associated with the federal University of Durham, offering BA and BSc degrees alongside teaching in education. Graduates of St Hild's were the first female graduates from Durham in 1898. The Chapel of the Venerable Bede, completed in 1939 to celebrate Bede College's centenary, was designed by the architectural partnership of Seely & Paget. The two colleges retained links throughout the next century with shared teaching and facilities. In the 1960s they constructed the shared Caedmon Complex. It was then that it was decided that the colleges should be formally merged and in 1975 they became the unitary College of St. Hild and St. Bede, a recognised college of the university. In 1979 Hild Bede joined the College Council, becoming a full constituent college of the university and ceasing to award its own PGCE qualifications. At this point some of the College buildings (including much of the teaching facilities of the Bede site) were occupied by the University's Department of Education, whilst the College centred its academic administration on the old Hild's site. Buildings The college consists of several distinct buildings, including the main Hild building, which is the administrative hub of the college containing the main college library, offices, computer room, common rooms and a large number of student rooms; other larger accommodation blocks, such as Thorp, Christopher, Bede; and several smaller houses such as Hild Gym, Bede Gym, Charles Stranks, Gables, Manor House, Manor Lodge, Belvedere and Grove House. At the centre of college is the Caedmon Complex, which contains a dining hall, the bar (The Vernon Arms, named after the original Hild Bede Principal, Dr Vernon Armitage, music rooms and the only student-run cinema in Durham, Bede Film Society. The college is one of two colleges in Durham to have two chapels ‚Äì The Chapel of St. Hild (now a function room named the Joachim Room) and The Chapel of the Venerable Bede (still in use). It is widely believed that The Chapel of the Venerable Bede inspired Belinda Carlisle's 1987 hit Heaven Is a Place on Earth, likely due to its ethereal architecture and the numerous spiritual experiences had there by Carlisle and former students. The college also maintains a boat house used by the boat club on the river near the Caedmon Complex. Traditions =Student Representative Council= Unlike most colleges of the university, the student body is not divided into Junior and Middle Common Rooms, instead both the undergraduate and postgraduate communities are represented by a single Student Representative Council (SRC). The SRC does however contain a special postgraduate committee and maintains the physical Junior and Middle Common Rooms, both in the Hild Building. The SRC is run by an elected exec that is headed by a sabbatical president. The college also has a Senior Common Room (SCR) consisting of the college tutors, past and current members of college staff and invited members of the wider community. To maintain the history of the two original colleges, males in the college wear the Bede colours of light and dark blue, the colours that the College are more widely known for, whilst female colours are the green and lilac of the original Hild College. The College Arms also represents the history of the precursor colleges, with the chief taken directly from the Arms of the College of the Venerable Bede and the chevron being adapted from the bend of Arms of St. Hild College. =Gowns= The gowns worn by members of the college, retained from before the college became a constituent college of the University, differ from other Durham gowns in being made of brocaded fabric and being shorter. These are worn at matriculation and graduation, but not at formal hall. Formals are instead black tie events and happen around ten times a year.226x226px =Postgraduate formals= Held in the Joachim Room, these are formal, gowned, black tie dinners that happen four times per year. =College events= Like most Durham colleges, Hild Bede celebrates an annual college day, usually in early May. This day usually includes a champagne breakfast on the college lawns; an optional service in the cathedral; a buffet lunch in the dining hall and a marquee; picnics and barbecues on the lawns; and entertainment throughout the day including bands, fairground-style events, disco, ceilidh and college olympics. In late April, the college is host to the sounding retreat ceremony in conjunction with the Durham Light Infantry Association. Initially instituted to remember students and staff of the Bede College Company who lost their lives at the Second Battle of Ypres, it now commemorates all former members of the college who have died in conflicts around the world. The college also hosts two annual balls, the Christmas ball at the end of Michaelmas Term and the summer ball after exams have finished. The summer ball has an annual budget of ¬£60,000 and usually attracts a headline act. It has attracted acts such as Showaddywaddy, Pixie Lott, The Feeling, Scouting for Girls, Basshunter and Redlight. It is one of the biggest balls in Durham, primarily due to the size of the budget and the entertainment provided. Student life Playing fields of the College. =Sport= Hild Bede AFC are the college football club and won the Premiership in the 2014/15 season. There have also been successes in the lower teams, with the 3s being promoted in 2018 , the 7s finishing 7th in 2019 and the 7s beating the 8s 8-1 and finishing top of Division 6 in 2020. The college's affiliated rugby teams are Bede RFC (the men's team, playing in the traditional Bede College colours of light and dark blue) and Hild RFC (the women's team, playing in the traditional St Hild's College colours of green, purple and white). left The boat club can also boast recent successes; qualifying for Henley Royal Regatta in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016. =Theatre= Hild Bede Theatre is the biggest college drama society in Durham and puts on at least three productions annually, including a musical at the beginning of the third term. In 2009‚Äì10 they won two Durham Oscars, \\"best college play\\" for \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" and \\"Best college musical\\" for 42nd Street. They have won the latter more times than any other Durham theatre group, having won for the last 7 years in a row. =Cinema= Hild Bede houses the only student cinema in Durham, Bede Film Society. The society used to showcase recent films on a 35mm projector, but, in celebration of the Bede Film Society's 50th anniversary, has since installed a new digital projector funded by ¬£40,000 of alumni donations, with Dolby Digital surround sound. Films are shown on most weekends of term, with the occasional midweek showing. The society was started over fifty years ago, before the merging of the two colleges, showing films on a 16mm projector. =Bar Quiz= Every Thursday, except during formal dinners, Hild Bede's bar, \\"the Vern\\", hosts its famous bar quiz, traditionally consisting of 50 questions on various topics. The winning team receives a ¬£20 bar tab. Nowadays, the final round of the quiz is always a \\"Wipeout\\" round. In this round, answering a question incorrectly results in \\"wiping out\\" and thus receiving 0 points for the entire round. The Bar Quiz exists under the jurisdiction of the SRC Entertainment's Committee (Ents Comm) and thus is overseen by the Social Secretary of the SRC. In addition, it has been known for the Social Secretary to appoint a \\"Head of Quizzes\\", from within Ents Comm, to help run these events. While the Social Secretary can wear what they like, it is customary and expected for the Head of Quizzes to wear their official royal blue Hild Bede sweatshirt. =Awards= Each year, several members of the college are awarded the Ann Boynton Award for outstanding contribution to college, for those who embody the spirit of the college whilst maintaining outstanding academic excellence. Another award is the Honorary Lifetime Membership award, given by the SRC President to those deemed to have contributed a great deal to college life. =List of Principals= ;College of the Venerable BedeCollege's Principals board in main reception * John Cundill 1841-1852 (not listed on the reception board but named in Durham County Advertiser 5 March 1852 p.8) * J.

The College is known for its and Victorian Gothic architecture, listed nineteenth-century chapels, reception rooms. The College has a full programme of art exhibitions, music, theatre events, tearooms and a caf√©. It was founded in 1808 by scholars from the English College, Douai, who had fled France after the French Revolution. Ushaw College was affiliated with Durham University from 1968 and was the principal Roman Catholic seminary for the training of Catholic priests in the north of England until it closed as a seminary in 2011 due to the shortage of vocations. It reopened as a visitor attraction in late 2014 and, as of 2019, receives around 50,000 visitors a year. The County Durham Music Service and Durham University spin-off the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring are based at the college and buildings at the college are also used by Durham University Business School. History =Founding= The English College, Douai was founded in 1568 but was forced to leave France in 1795 following the French Revolution. Part of the college settled temporarily at Crook Hall northwest of Durham. In 1804 Bishop William Gibson began to build at Ushaw Moor, four miles west of Durham. These buildings, designed by James Taylor, were opened as St Cuthbert's College in 1808. There was a steady expansion during the nineteenth century with new buildings put up to cater for the expanding number of clerical and secular students. In 1847, the newly built chapel, designed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin was opened.Gillow, Henry Chapels at Ushaw, with Historical Introduction (George Neasham, 1885) p. 55 This was followed by the Big Library and Exhibition Hall designed by Joseph Hansom, 1849‚Äì1851.Harris, Penelope, \\"The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803‚Äì1882)\\", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, p.157, The Junior House, designed by Peter Paul Pugin, was added in 1859. St Cuthbert's Chapel, designed by Dunn and Hansom, was opened in 1884, replacing the one noted above, which the seminary had outgrown. The Refectory was designed and built by E. W. Pugin. The final development came in the early 1960s with the opening of a new East wing, providing additional classrooms and single bedrooms for 75 students. The main college buildings are Grade II listed, the College Chapel is Grade II* and the Chapel of St Michael is Grade I. =University of Durham= Although independent, Ushaw College had a close working relationship with Durham University. The college became a Licensed Hall of Residence of the University of Durham in 1968. It was independent of the university but offered courses validated by the university, and both Church and lay students studied at the college. The Junior House closed in 1972, its younger students being transferred to St Joseph's College, Up Holland in Lancashire. =21st Century= In 2002, the college rejected a report from the Roman Catholic hierarchy that it should merge with St Mary's College, Oscott, near Birmingham. However, in October 2010 it was announced that the college would close in 2011 due to the shortage of vocations in the Roman Catholic Church, and that the site might be sold. Following a detailed feasibility study by the college's Trustees and Durham University, and with support from Durham County Council and English Heritage, it was announced in January 2012 that Durham Business School would temporarily relocate to the college during rebuilding of the School's buildings in Durham. This was seen as the first step in a long- term education-based vision for the site. The university also agreed to catalogue and archive the Ushaw library and inventory the other collections to ensure their preservation and specialist conservation, with a view to creating a proposed Ushaw Centre for Catholic Scholarship and Heritage. In March 2019, an uncatalogued early charter of King John was found in the library manuscript collection.BBC news report In 2017, Durham University announced plans to develop an international residential research library at Ushaw College, with the aim of attracting scholars from around the world to work on the collections of Ushaw, Durham University and Durham Cathedral. The university has also confirmed that it has extended the agreement to lease the east wing of the college (used by the Business School) to 2027. The college is also used for numerous musical events and for the Ushaw Lecture Series, organised by the university's Centre for Catholic Studies. In 2018, Durham University's Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM) moved into the east wing of the college, previously used by the Business School. Heraldry The college armorial bearings are \\"Per pale dexter Argent a Cross Gules on a Canton Azure a Cross of St Cuthbert proper sinister impaling Allen Argent three Rabbits couchant in pale Sable.\\" Various emblems on shield represent the college's history and foundation, for example:- * Three coneys are from the family coat of arms of William Allen, the founder of English College, Douai. See Three hares. * The small cross of St Cuthbert represents the college's patron saint (it is modelled on St Cuthbert's own pectoral cross, which is kept in the Treasury at Durham Cathedral). * The large cross of St George honours the English Roman Catholic Martyrs.

It was depopulated in May 1948. Abu Shusha was located on the slope of Tell Jezer/Tell el-Jazari, which is commonly identified with the ancient city of Gezer. In April‚ÄìMay 1948, during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Abu Shusha was attacked several times. The final assault began on May 13, one day prior to Israel's declaration of independence. Abu Shusha residents attempted to defend the village, but the village was occupied on May 14. Those residents who had not already died or fled were expelled by May 21.Morris, 2004, pp. 256-257 With their descendants, they numbered about 6,198 in 1998. Name Abu Shusheh is said to derive its name from a derwish who prayed for rain in a time of drought, and was told by a sand-diviner that he would perish if it came. The water came out of the earth (probably at Et Tannur) and formed a pool, into which he stepped and was drowned. The people, seeing only his topknot left, cried Ya Abu Shusheh (‚ÄúOh Father of the Topknot‚Äù). History The Crusaders called the place Mont Gisart. In 1177 the Crusaders won a battle against Saladin there. Ceramics and coins from the 13th century have been found. =Ottoman era= Abu Shusha in the 1871-77 PEF Survey of Palestine A Maqam (shrine) was built there in the 16th century. In 1838, Abu Shusheh was noted as a Muslim village in the Ibn Humar area in the District of Er-Ramleh.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 120 Edward Robinson also noted the village on his travels in the region in 1852.Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 143, 146 In 1869 or 1872, the village lands were purchased by Melville Peter Bergheim of Jerusalem, a Protestant of German origin. Bergheim established a modern agricultural farm, using European methods and equipment. Bergheim's ownership of the land was hotly contested by the villagers, by legal and illegal means. After the Bergheim company went bankrupt in 1892, Abu Shusa's lands were managed by a government receiver.Ruth Kark, Changing patterns of landownership in nineteenth-century Palestine: the European influence, Journal of Historical Geography, vol 14, no 4 (1984) 357-384. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) noted that the extent of land farmed by Mr. Bergheim at Abu Shusheh was 5,000 acres. The boundaries was shown on the Survey's map as a dotted line: ____ . . . . _____ . . . . SWP further described Abu Shusha as a small village built of stone and adobe and surrounded by cactus hedges, populated by about 100 families.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 407 Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 358 Elihu Grant, who visited the village, described it as \\"tiny\\" in 1907.Grant, 1907, p. 17, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 358 In 1910s, part of the land was sold by the government receiver to the villagers and the rest to the Jewish Colonization Association, which gave the villagers one third of their purchase in order to settle the dispute. After World War I, the land in Jewish hands was sold to the Maccabean Land Company, and later transferred to the Jewish National Fund. In November, 1917, the British 6th Mounted Brigade charged a Turkish detachment defending the heights above Abu Shusheh. The Turks suffered 'heavy casualties'.Bruce, 2002, p. 152 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Abu Shusheh had a population of 603 residents; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Ramleh, p. 21 increasing in the 1931 census to 627, still all Muslims, in a total of 145 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 18 The village had a mosque and a number of shops. A village school was founded in 1947, with an initial enrollment of 33 students. In the 1945 statistics the population of Abu Shusha was 870, all Muslims, with a total land area of 9,425 dunams. 2,475 dunums of village land were allotted to cereals, 54 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

A few inhabitants fled but most remained. The Givati troops were immediately replaced by militia men from kibbutz Gezer, who were later replaced by troops from Kiryati Brigade.Morris, 2004, p. 205 On May 19, Arab Legion sources claimed that villagers were being killed. On May 21, Arab authorities appealed to the Red Cross to stop \\"barbaric acts\\" they said were being committed in Abu Shusha.Morris, 2004, p. 257 A Haganah soldier was reported to have twice attempted to rape a 20-year- old woman prisoner.\\"Doron\\" (Maoz) to HIS-AD, \\"The Interrogation of Women Prisoners in the village of Abu Shusha\\", 24 Jun. 1948, HA 105\\\\92 aleph. Quoted in Morris, 2004, p. 257 The residents that had remained in the village were expelled, apparently on 21 May. More recently, research conducted by Birzeit University, mostly on the basis of interviews with former residents, suggests that between 60-70 residents were killed or massacred during the attack.Birzeit University series on Palestinian destroyed villages, 276 page report on Abu Shusha; some information here: In 1995 a mass grave with 52 skeletons was discovered, but their cause of death is undetermined.Benvenisti, 1996, p. 248 Israeli historian, Aryeh Yitzhaki, explains the events of Abu Shusha as a massacre citing a testimony from the Kheil Mishmar (Guard Units): > \\"A soldier of Kiryati Brigade captured 10 men and 2 women. All were killed > except a young woman who was raped and disposed of. At the dawn of 14 May, > units of Giv'ati brigade assaulted Abu Shusha village. Fleeing villagers > were shot on sight.

The remains of the village were destroyed in 1965 as part of a government operation to clear the country of abandoned villages, which were regarded by the Israel Land Administration as \\"a blot on the landscape\\".Aron Shai, The fate of abandoned Arab villages in Israel, 1965-1969, History and Memory, Vol 18 (2006) pp86-106. In 1992 the village site was described: \\"The Israeli settlement of Ameilim occupies much of the site. Figs and cypress trees, cactuses and one palm tree grow on the site. The surrounding valleys are planted in apricots and figs, and various kinds of fruit trees are cultivated on the heights.\\" See also * Al-Barriyya References Bibliography     * External links *Welcome to Abu-Shusha *Abu Shusha (Ramla), Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 16: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Abu Shusha, from Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center *Abu Shusha by Rami Nashashibi (1996), Center for Research and Documentation of Palestinian Society. *Abu Shusha - A Survivor's Testimony by Rami Nashashibi (1996), Center for Research and Documentation of Palestinian Society Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:District of Ramla Category:Massacres in Mandatory Palestine Category:Zionist terrorism ","title":"Abu Shusha"},{"id":"916917","text":"Norsta Runestone (U 861) on the drive of Wik Castle outside Uppsala was probably made by Sweyn and his family, as it mentions two people called Sweyn and M√∏y. It is the only existing mention of a M√∏y (\\"maiden\\") besides the mention of Sweyn's sister M√¶r (the Old Icelandic form of M√∏y) in Hervarar saga, and it is contemporary with Sweyn. Sweyn (, Sweyn the Sacrificer) was a Swedish king c. 1080, who replaced his Christian brother-in-law Inge as King of Sweden, when Inge had refused to administer the bl√≥ts (pagan sacrifices) at the Temple at Uppsala. There is no mention of Sweyn in the regnal list of the Westrogothic law, which suggests that his rule did not reach V√§sterg√∂tland. According to Swedish historian Adolf Sch√ºck he was probably the same person as H√•kan the Red and was called the Bl√≥t Swain (a swain who was willing to perform the bl√≥t) as an epithet rather than a personal name. Becoming king The earliest source that deals with Blot-Sweyn's coming to power is the Icelandic legendary saga Hervarar saga: However, Inge did not permit the people to follow the old ways, unlike his father Stenkil. The Swedes reacted strongly and asked Inge to either comply with the old traditions or abdicate. When Inge proclaimed that he would not abandon Christianity, the people pelted him with stones and chased him away. This was the opportunity for Sweyn to assume power, and the account provided by Hervarar saga concerning his inauguration contains a rare description of the ancient Indo-European ritual of horse sacrifice: Legend of Saint Eskil The later Legend of Saint Eskil tells that Inge was chased away from the kingdom. They then elected an idolator for king by the name Sweyn, an unworthy man and with reason called Blood-Sweyn. He had this name because he made the people drink blood from bulls that had been sacrificed to the gods, and he ate the sacrificial meat. The people assembled around their king in Str√§ngn√§s, where they butchered oxen and sheep, and gave offerings to their gods. They had a great banquet in honour of the king and their gods. The English bishop Eskil then appeared and tried to convert the pagans to Christianity. They would not listen, however. Eskil prayed, and God sent thunder, hail, snow and rain destroying the sacrificial altar and beasts of sacrifice. Not a single drop fell on the bishop. The pagans were not impressed and furiously, they attacked Eskil. A diviner named Sp√•bodde hit him on the head with a stone, while another man crushed his head with an axe. Some chieftains dragged the dying martyr to the king saying that Eskil had used magic arts to control the weather. As soon as the unrightful king had sentenced Eskil to death, he was taken to the valley where the monastery later was founded, and he was stoned to death This legend is, however, only known from the late 13th century. An account by Aelnoth of Canterbury (c. 1122) relates that an Eskillinus was killed by pagan Swedes and Geats at an unspecified time. Since he is not mentioned by the clerical historian Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), he may have flourished in the late 11th century.Toni Schmid, \\"Eskil\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon According to another opinion, Eskil's death is more probably dated in c. 1016, several generations before Blot-Sweyn.Legenden om Sankt Eskil, http://www.spanga- kista.se/helgontexter/eskillegend.htm How Sweyn was killed According to Hervarar saga, the rule of Sweyn was not to last. Before long, the Christian Inge decided to kill the pagan Sweyn: A similar account appears in the Orkneyinga saga, but in this text, Sweyn remains inside and is burnt to death: Succession It is possible that Inge was not immediately accepted by the stubbornly pagan Swedes of Uppland. The 13th-century historian Snorri Sturlusson wrote in the Heimskringla that Bl√≥t-Sweyn had a pagan successor who continued the sacrifices: This \\"Eirik Arsale\\" (Erik √Örs√§ll) is mentioned in other sources as being the son of Blot-Sweyn, but today is not considered a historical person by most historians.Lagerqvist & √Öberg in Kings and Rulers of Sweden p. 13 Notes Category:11th-century Swedish monarchs Category:Swedish pagans Category:Pagan restorations Category:House of Stenkil Category:11th-century murdered monarchs Category:Deaths from fire Category:Pagan martyrs ","title":"Blot-Sweyn"},{"id":"916927","text":"Stephenson College is a college of the University of Durham in England. Formerly one of two colleges located at Queen's Campus in Thornaby-on-Tees, it was relocated to the city of Durham at the end of the 2017-8 academic year, joining Josephine Butler College at the Howlands Farm site. It is named after George Stephenson, the 19th century railway engineer. History left In 1992 the Joint University College on Teesside of the Universities of Durham and Teesside (JUCOT) was established on the site as a joint venture between the University of Durham and the University of Teesside. This was initially intended to grant joint degrees validated by both institutions (BAs and BScs). However, Teesside, which had only become a university in 1992, had difficulties in taking on its responsibilities for the college and Durham took full control in 1994. A programme of integration with Durham began, leading to the college becoming University College, Stockton (UCS) in 1996 -- a college of the University of Durham and the only college with teaching responsibilities. Further integration led to the campus being renamed the University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC) in 1998, and the removal of its teaching responsibilities. In 2001 UDSC was split into two colleges: one was George Stephenson College, and the other was John Snow College. In late 2006 the college name was changed to Stephenson College though the JCR remains George Stephenson JCR. 2010 saw the opening of Stephenson Central, in the middle of the college. This multi-purpose building has a library, games, meeting and TV room with a bar at the centre; it is also the home of the JCR office and is for the use of all students of the college. Stephenson College and the other Queen's Campus college, John Snow College, relocated to Durham on a phased basis starting in October 2017. They join Josephine Butler College on the Howlands Farm site.

The College takes its name from the nineteenth-century Yorkshire physician Dr John Snow. It was founded in 2001 on the university's Stockton campus, and moved to Durham in 2018. Its purpose built buildings on the former golf course at Mount Oswald opened in 2020. History The college's 2019-20 home, Rushford Court In 1992, the Joint University College on Teesside of the Universities of Durham and Teesside (JUCOT) was established on the site as a joint venture between the University of Durham and the University of Teesside. This was initially intended to grant joint degrees validated by both institutions (BAs and BScs). However, Teesside, which had only become a university in 1992, had difficulties in taking on its responsibilities for the college and Durham took full control in 1994. A programme of integration with Durham began, leading to the college becoming University College, Stockton (UCS) in 1996 ‚Äì a college of the University of Durham and the only college with teaching responsibilities. Further integration led to the campus being renamed the University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC) in 1998, and the removal of its teaching responsibilities. In 2001, UDSC was split into two colleges: one was John Snow College, and the other was George Stephenson College; the campus was also renamed University of Durham, Queen's Campus (UDQC), in honour of the Queen's jubilee. In 2018 John Snow College moved temporarily to Howlands Farm, Durham City adjacent to the Josephine Butler and George Stephenson Colleges. For the 2019-20 year, the college moves to Rushford Court in the centre of Durham, a privately-operated hall on the site of the former County Hospital. College entrance and central building In 2020, the college moved to new purpose-built buildings at Mount Oswald, between the new South College and Durham University Business School. Traditions John Snow holds termly formal dinners, in which members of college attend in their relevant Academic dress of Durham University. A set of rules governing behaviour at formals is outlined by the college, and disciplined by the JCR Chairman. Two college Balls are held per annum, one in the Michaelmas Term and a further Graduation Ball in the Easter Term, with a large portion of the college in attendance. Snow Day occurs once a year and is a vibrant and enthusiastic celebration of college life. The event is held within college accommodation and features entertainment, music and food. The day begins with a water fight in the spirit of John Snow's medical research into the causes of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, which was ultimately traced to the water supply. The first water fight occurred on the very first Snow day on 27 May 2002. The water fight commences early in the morning, serving to wake college members for the day ahead. John Snow College is the only college in Durham to have the position of 'College Bugler'. Each year the college bugler processes the new intake of students through the city of Durham and announces their arrival at the Cathedral, ready for Matriculation. The bugler also attends all formal events and announces the high table at the beginning of each formal. =John Snow College Boat Club= John Snow College Boat Club (JSBC) is the rowing club of John Snow College, at Durham University. History When Durham University took responsibility of the campus in 1994, Tees Rowing Club was asked to help develop rowing. The campus became known as University College, Stockton (UCS) in 1996 and as such the boat club was called University College Stockton Boat Club (UCSBC), to differentiate it from University College, Durham. Further integration led to the campus being renamed in 1998 along with the Boat Club University of Durham Stockton Campus Boat Club (UDSCBC) to differentiate it from University College Boat Club. The club rented out rack space for its boats in Tees Rowing Club's boathouse down Boathouse Lane, the site of Tees Rowing Club's boathouse since 1864. The club raced under the Palatinate Colours, the remains of which can be seen on the old blades. In September 2001, John Snow and George Stephenson Colleges were formed out of University of Durham Stockton Campus, which although it provided UDSCBC the opportunity to create two separate clubs, it was decided due to low membership and boats that it should remain a joint club. In November 2001 both Tees Rowing Club and UDSCBC left the site on Boathouse Lane and moved into new shared premises at The River Tees Watersports Centre, which was funded by the Big Lottery Fund and ¬£80,000 from Durham University.

It was originally developed by (Jack) Jacob T. Schwartz at the New York University (NYU) Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in the late 1960s.  Design  SETL provides two basic aggregate data types: unordered sets, and sequences (the latter also called tuples). The elements of sets and tuples can be of any arbitrary type, including sets and tuples themselves. Maps are provided as sets of pairs (i.e., tuples of length 2) and can have arbitrary domain and range types. Primitive operations in SETL include set membership, union, intersection, and power set construction, among others. SETL provides quantified boolean expressions constructed using the universal and existential quantifiers of first-order predicate logic. SETL provides several iterators to produce a variety of loops over aggregate data structures.  Examples  Print all prime numbers from 2 to N: print([n in [2..N]  forall m in {2..n - 1}  n mod m > 0]); The notation is similar to list comprehension. A factorial procedure definition: procedure factorial(n); -- calculates the factorial n! return if n = 1 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1) end if; end factorial; A more conventional SETL expression for factorial (n > 0): */[1..n]  Uses  In the 1970s, SETL was ported to the BESM-6, ES EVM and other Russian computer systems. SETL was used for an early implementation of the programming language Ada, named the NYU Ada/ED translator. This later became the first validated Ada implementation, certified on April 11, 1983. According to Guido van Rossum, \\"Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL -- Lambert Meertens spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design!\\"Python-Dev: SETL (was: Lukewarm about range literals) Language variants SET Language 2 (SETL2), a backward incompatible descendant of SETL, was created by Kirk Snyder of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University in the late 1980s. Like its predecessor, it is based on the theory and notation of finite sets, but has also been influenced in syntax and style by the Ada language. Interactive SET Language (ISETL) is a variant of SETL used in discrete mathematics.

The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship's propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as supercarriers. A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built. Compared to oil or coal fuelled ships, nuclear propulsion offers the advantages of very long intervals of operation before refueling. All the fuel is contained within the nuclear reactor, so no cargo or supplies space is taken up by fuel, nor is space taken up by exhaust stacks or combustion air intakes. However, the low fuel cost is offset by high operating costs and investment in infrastructure, so nearly all nuclear-powered vessels are military. When the nuclear-powered was put into service in 2007, it became the world's largest icebreaker. Power plants =Basic operation of naval ship or submarine= Most naval nuclear reactors are of the pressurized water type, with the exception of a few attempts at using liquid sodium cooled reactors. A primary water circuit transfers heat generated from nuclear fission in the fuel to a steam generator; this water is kept under pressure so it does not boil. This circuit operates at a temperature of around . Any radioactive contamination in the primary water is confined. Water is circulated by pumps; at lower power levels, reactors designed for submarines may rely on natural circulation of the water to reduce noise generated by the pumps. The hot water from the reactor heats a separate water circuit in the steam generator. The water turns to steam and passes through steam driers on its way to the steam turbine. Spent steam at low pressure is run through a condenser cooled by seawater and returns to liquid form. The water is pumped back to the steam generator and continues the cycle. Any water lost in the process can be made up by desalinated sea water added to the steam generator feed water.Viren Chopra, Rob Houston (ed), DK Eyewitness Books: Transportation, Penguin, 2012, page 60 In the turbine, the steam expands and reduces its pressure as it imparts energy to the rotating blades of the turbine. There may be many stages of rotating blades and fixed guide vanes. The output shaft of the turbine may be connected to a gearbox to reduce rotation speed, then a shaft connects to the vessel's propellers. In another form of drive system, the turbine turns an electrical generator, and the electric power produced is fed to one or more drive motors for the vessel's propellers. The Russian, US and British navies rely on direct steam turbine propulsion, while French and Chinese ships use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion (turbo-electric transmission). Some nuclear submarines have a single reactor, but Russian submarines have two, and so had . Most American aircraft carriers are powered by two reactors, but had eight. The majority of marine reactors are of the pressurized water type, although the US and Soviet navies have designed warships powered with liquid metal cooled reactors. =Differences from land power plants= Marine-type reactors differ from land-based commercial electric power reactors in several respects. While land-based reactors in nuclear power plants produce up to around 1600 megawatts of electrical power, a typical marine propulsion reactor produces no more than a few hundred megawatts. Space considerations dictate that a marine reactor must be physically small, so it must generate higher power per unit of space. This means its components are subject to greater stresses than those of a land-based reactor. Its mechanical systems must operate flawlessly under the adverse conditions encountered at sea, including vibration and the pitching and rolling of a ship operating in rough seas. Reactor shutdown mechanisms cannot rely on gravity to drop control rods into place as in a land-based reactor that always remains upright. Salt water corrosion is an additional problem that complicates maintenance. A nuclear fuel element for the cargo ship . The element contains four bundles of 41 fuel rods. The uranium oxide is enriched to 4.2 and 4.6 percent U-235 As the core of a seagoing reactor is much smaller than a power reactor, the probability of a neutron intersecting with a fissionable nucleus before it escapes into the shielding is much lower. As such, the fuel is typically more highly enriched (i.e., contains a higher concentration of 235U vs. 238U) than that used in a land-based nuclear power plant, which increases the probability of fission to the level where a sustained reaction can occur. Some marine reactors run on relatively low- enriched uranium which requires more frequent refueling. Others run on highly enriched uranium, varying from 20% 235U, to the over 96% 235U found in U.S. submarines, in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine). Using more-highly enriched fuel also increases the reactor's power density and extends the usable life of the nuclear fuel load, but is more expensive and a greater risk to nuclear proliferation than less- highly enriched fuel. A marine nuclear propulsion plant must be designed to be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which might have to be undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium dioxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a \\"burnable poison\\" in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the \\"nuclear poison\\" increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact reactor pressure vessel is extended by providing an internal neutron shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons. Decommissioning Decommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for US and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the ship-submarine recycling program). In Russia, whole vessels, or sealed reactor sections, typically remain stored afloat, although a new facility near Sayda Bay is to provide storage in a concrete-floored facility on land for some submarines in the far north. Future designs Russia built a floating nuclear power plant for its far eastern territories. The design has two 35 MWe units based on the KLT-40 reactor used in icebreakers (with refueling every four years). Some Russian naval vessels have been used to supply electricity for domestic and industrial use in remote far eastern and Siberian towns. In 2010, Lloyd's Register was investigating the possibility of civilian nuclear marine propulsion and rewriting draft rules (see text under Merchant Ships).. Civil liability Insurance of nuclear vessels is not like the insurance of conventional ships. The consequences of an accident could span national boundaries, and the magnitude of possible damage is beyond the capacity of private insurers. A special international agreement, the Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships, developed in 1962, would have made signatory national governments liable for accidents caused by nuclear vessels under their flag but was never ratified owing to disagreement on the inclusion of warships under the convention. Nuclear reactors under United States jurisdiction are insured by the provisions of the Price‚ÄìAnderson Act. Military nuclear ships By 1990, there were more nuclear reactors powering ships (mostly military) than there were generating electric power in commercial power plants worldwide. in New York harbor, 25 August 1958. Nautilus had recently completed a polar voyage under the Arctic ice. The nuclear-propelled returning to Toulon, its home port, after Mission H√©racl√®s. Under the direction of U.S. Navy Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover, the design, development and production of nuclear marine propulsion plants started in the United States in the 1940s. The first prototype naval reactor was constructed and tested at the Naval Reactor Facility at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho (now called the Idaho National Laboratory) in 1953. = Submarines = The first nuclear submarine, , put to sea in 1955 (SS was a traditional designation for US submarines, while SSN denoted the first \\"nuclear\\" submarine). The Soviet Union also developed nuclear submarines. The first types developed were the Project 627, NATO designated with two water- cooled reactors, the first of which, K-3 Leninskiy Komsomol, was underway under nuclear power on July 4, 1958. Nuclear power revolutionized the submarine, finally making it a true \\"underwater\\" vessel, rather than a \\"submersible\\" craft, which could only stay underwater for limited periods. It gave the submarine the ability to operate submerged at high speeds, comparable to those of surface vessels, for unlimited periods, dependent only on the endurance of its crew. To demonstrate this was the first vessel to execute a submerged circumnavigation of the Earth (Operation Sandblast), doing so in 1960. Nautilus, with a pressurized water reactor (PWR), led to the parallel development of other submarines like a unique liquid metal cooled (sodium) reactor in , or two reactors in Triton, and then the s, powered by single reactors, and a cruiser, , in 1961, powered by two reactors. By 1962 the United States Navy had 26 operational nuclear submarines and another 30 under construction. Nuclear power had revolutionized the Navy. The United States shared its technology with the United Kingdom, while French, Soviet, Indian and Chinese development proceeded separately. After the Skate-class vessels, US submarines were powered by a series of standardized, single-reactor designs built by Westinghouse and General Electric. Rolls-Royce plc built similar units for Royal Navy submarines, eventually developing a modified version of their own, the PWR-2 (pressurized water reactor). The largest nuclear submarines ever built are the 26,500 tonne Russian . The smallest nuclear warships to date are the 2,700 tonne French attack submarines. The US Navy operated an unarmed nuclear submarine, the NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft, between 1969 and 2008, which was not a combat vessel but was the smallest nuclear powered submarine at 400 tons. = Aircraft carriers = The United States and France have built nuclear aircraft carriers. The aircraft carrier of the French Navy The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz of the United States Navy * The sole French nuclear aircraft carrier example is , commissioned in 2001 (a second one is plannedhttps://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/10/23/le-programme-du- porte-avions-qui-remplacera-le-charles-de-gaulle-est-lance_a_23569015/). * The United States Navy have a much broader experience. , in service 1962‚Äì2012, powered by eight reactor units, is still the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors, with each A2W reactor taking the place of one of the conventional boilers in earlier constructions. Recent US vessels include the and successor es.  French Navy  The French Navy operates one carrier equipped with catapults and arresters. The is a 42,000 tonne nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2001 and is the flagship of the French Navy (Marine Nationale). The ship carries a complement of Dassault Rafale M and E‚Äë2C Hawkeye aircraft, EC725 Caracal and AS532 Cougar helicopters for combat search and rescue, as well as modern electronics and Aster missiles.  United States Navy  The United States Navy operates 11 carriers, all nuclear-powered: *: ten 101,000-ton, 1,092 ft long fleet carriers, the first of which was commissioned in 1975. A Nimitz-class carrier is powered by two nuclear reactors providing steam to four steam turbines and is long, *, one 110,000-ton, 1,106 ft long fleet carrier. The lead of the class , came into service in 2017, with another nine planned. = Destroyers and cruisers =  Russian Navy  The Russian flagship Pyotr Veliky The Kirov class, Soviet designation 'Project 1144 Orlan' (sea eagle), is a class of nuclear powered guided missile cruisers of the Soviet Navy and Russian Navy, the largest and heaviest surface combatant warships (i.e. not an aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship) in operation in the world. Among modern warships, they are second in size only to large aircraft carriers, and of similar size to a World War II era battleships. The Soviet classification of the ship-type is \\"heavy nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser\\" (). The ships are often referred to as battlecruisers by Western defence commentators due to their size and general appearance.Armi da guerra, De Agostini, Novara, 1985.  United States Navy  The United States Navy at one time had nuclear powered cruisers as part of its fleet. The first such ship was USS Long Beach (CGN-9). Commissioned in 1961, she was the world's first nuclear powered surface combatant. She was followed a year later by USS Bainbridge (DLGN-25). While Long Beach was designed and built as a cruiser, Bainbridge began life as a frigate, though at that time the Navy was using the hull code \\"DLGN\\" for \\"destroyer leader, guided missile, nuclear\\". The last nuclear powered cruisers the Americans would produce would be the four-ship . was commissioned in 1976, followed by in 1977, in 1978 and finally in 1980. Ultimately, all these ships proved to be too costly to maintain and they were all retired between 1993 and 1999. = Other military ships = = Communication and command ships = Command and communications ship SSV-33 Ural SSV-33 Ural (–°–°–í-33 –£—Ä–∞–ª; NATO reporting name: Kapusta [Russian for \\"cabbage\\"]) was a command and control naval ship operated by the Soviet Navy. SSV-33s hull was derived from that of the nuclear powered s with nuclear marine propulsion. SSV-33 served in electronic intelligence, missile tracking, space tracking, and communications relay roles. Due to high operating costs, SSV-33 was laid up. SSV-33 carried only light defensive weapons. These were two AK-176 76 mm guns, four AK-630 30 mm guns, and four quadruple Igla missile mounts. = Nuclear powered UUV = The Poseidon (, \\"Poseidon\\", NATO reporting name Kanyon), previously known by Russian codename Status-6 (), is a nuclear- powered and nuclear-armed unmanned underwater vehicle under development by Rubin Design Bureau, capable to deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads. According to Russian state TV, it is claimed to be able to deliver a thermonuclear cobalt bomb of up to 200 megatonnes (four times as powerful as the most powerful device ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, and twice its maximum theoretical yield) against an enemy's naval ports and coastal cities. Civilian nuclear ships Engineer epaulette from Savannah The following are ships that are or were in commercial or civilian use and have nuclear marine propulsion. =Merchant ships= Nuclear-powered, civil merchant ships have not developed beyond a few experimental ships. The US-built , completed in 1962, was primarily a demonstration of civil nuclear power and was too small and expensive to operate economically as a merchant ship. The design was too much of a compromise, being neither an efficient freighter nor a viable passenger liner. The German-built , a cargo ship and research facility, sailed some on 126 voyages over 10 years without any technical problems. However, it proved too expensive to operate and was converted to diesel. The Japanese was dogged by technical and political problems. Its reactor had significant radiation leakage and fishermen protested against the vessel's operation. All of these three ships used low-enriched uranium. Sevmorput, a Soviet and later Russian LASH carrier with icebreaking capability, has operated successfully on the Northern Sea Route since it was commissioned in 1988. , it is the only nuclear-powered merchant ship in service. Civilian nuclear ships suffer from the costs of specialized infrastructure. The Savannah was expensive to operate since it was the only vessel using its specialized nuclear shore staff and servicing facility. A larger fleet could share fixed costs among more operating vessels, reducing operating costs. Despite this, there is still interest in nuclear propulsion. In November 2010 British Maritime Technology and Lloyd's Register embarked upon a two-year study with US-based Hyperion Power Generation (now Gen4 Energy), and the Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading SA to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors. The research intended to produce a concept tanker-ship design, based on a 70 MWt reactor such as Hyperion's. In response to its members' interest in nuclear propulsion, Lloyd's Register has also re-written its 'rules' for nuclear ships, which concern the integration of a reactor certified by a land-based regulator with the rest of the ship. The overall rationale of the rule-making process assumes that in contrast to the current marine industry practice where the designer/builder typically demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements, in the future the nuclear regulators will wish to ensure that it is the operator of the nuclear plant that demonstrates safety in operation, in addition to the safety through design and construction. Nuclear ships are currently the responsibility of their own countries, but none are involved in international trade. As a result of this work in 2014 two papers on commercial nuclear marine propulsion were published by Lloyd's Register and the other members of this consortium. These publications review past and recent work in the area of marine nuclear propulsion and describe a preliminary concept design study for a Suezmax tanker that is based on a conventional hull form with alternative arrangements for accommodating a 70 MWt nuclear propulsion plant delivering up to 23.5 MW shaft power at maximum continuous rating (average: 9.75 MW).

This is a small fast-neutron reactor using lead- bismuth eutectic cooling and able to operate for ten full-power years before refueling, and in service last for a 25-year operational life of the vessel. They conclude that the concept is feasible, but further maturity of nuclear technology and the development and harmonisation of the regulatory framework would be necessary before the concept would be viable. =Merchant cargo ships= * , Japan (1970‚Äì1992; never carried commercial cargo, rebuild as diesel engine powered RV Mirai in 1996) * , Germany (1968‚Äì1979; re-powered with diesel engine in 1979) * , United States (1962‚Äì1972) * Sevmorput, Russia (1988‚Äìpresent) =Icebreakers= Nuclear propulsion has proven both technically and economically feasible for nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Soviet Arctic. Nuclear-fuelled ships operate for years without refueling, and the vessels have powerful engines, well-suited to the task of icebreaking. The Soviet icebreaker Lenin was the world's first nuclear-powered surface vessel in 1959 and remained in service for 30 years (new reactors were fitted in 1970). It led to a series of larger icebreakers, the 23,500 ton of six vessels, launched beginning in 1975. These vessels have two reactors and are used in deep Arctic waters. NS Arktika was the first surface vessel to reach the North Pole. For use in shallow waters such as estuaries and rivers, shallow-draft, Taymyr-class icebreakers were built in Finland and then fitted with their single-reactor nuclear propulsion system in Russia. They were built to conform to international safety standards for nuclear vessels. All nuclear- powered icebreakers have been commissioned by the Soviet Union or Russia. * (1959‚Äì1989; museum ship) * (1975‚Äì2008; inactive, decommissioned) * (1977‚Äì1992; scrapped) * (1985‚Äì2013; inactive, decomissioned) * (1986‚Äìpresent) * (1989‚Äìpresent) * (1990‚Äìpresent) * (1990‚Äì2014; decommissioned) * , formerly Ural (2007‚Äìpresent) * (under construction, planned to be in service in 2020) \\"–û–°–ö –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—Ç—å –∑–∞–∫–∞–∑—á–∏–∫—É –ª–µ–¥–æ–∫–æ–ª \\"–ê—Ä–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞\\" –≤ –º–∞–µ 2020 –≥–æ–¥–∞\\" (in Russian).

It was designed by British military engineers, and was built and maintained by African slaves. It is one of the best preserved historical fortifications in the Americas. The complex of fortifications were constructed on Brimstone Hill, a very steeply sloping hill situated close to the sea on the Western, Caribbean coast of St. Kitts. Early history Battle of Saint Kitts, 1782, as described by an observer in a French engraving titled \\"Attaque de Brimstomhill\\" Cannon were first mounted on Brimstone Hill in 1689 during the Nine Years' War, by Jean-Baptiste du Casse, when the French used them to capture the English Fort Charles. The English, under Sir Christopher Codrington, used the same tactic to recapture the fort a year later. From then on, the English used the hill as a fortress, mounting 24-pound cannon, taking advantage of its 972-foot height. In 1711 and 1731, lightning destroyed the gunpowder magazine. By 1736, the fort had 49 guns. Since 1795, 40 members of \\"The St. Christopher Corps of Embodied Slaves\\" served at the fort, armed with pikes and cutlasses. By 1780, the fortress was considered impregnable, \\"The Gibraltar of the Caribbean\\". On 11 Jan. 1782, the French under Admiral Comte Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse and Fran√ßois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill√©, laid siege to the fort. During the siege, the adjacent island of Nevis surrendered, and guns from Fort Charles and other small forts there were brought to St. Kitts for use against Brimstone Hill. British Admiral Hood could not dislodge de Grasse, and after a month of siege, the heavily outnumbered and cut-off British garrison surrendered. However, a year later, the Treaty of Paris (1783) restored St. Kitts and Brimstone Hill to British rule, along with the adjacent island of Nevis. Following these events, the British carried out a program to augment and strengthen the fortifications, and Brimstone Hill never again fell to an enemy force. The French navy tried to recapture the fort in 1806 but failed.Brimstone Hill Fortress . Sean Spurr. Caribbean.org.uk. Accessed 16 Oct 2012. French Admiral √âdouard Thomas Burgues de Missiessy raided the island and succeeded in blowing up the powder magazine in 1805. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the local militias throughout the Caribbean were disbanded in 1838. The fort was abandoned by the British in 1853, and the militia disbanded in 1854. The structures gradually started to decay through vandalism and natural processes. 20th century Stabilization and restoration of the remaining structures of the fortress started in the early 1900s. In 1973, Prince Charles reopened the first area to be completely restored, which was the Prince of Wales Bastion, shown here at the top of the article. In 1985, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a plaque naming Brimstone Hill as a National Park. Legislation in 1987 officially declared Brimstone Hill to be a National Park, and it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. 21st century Areas that can be toured on Brimstone Hill include the imposing Fort George Citadel (which includes the Fort George Museum), the Western Place of Arms and the Eastern Place of Arms, all accessed via a steep walk up from the main parking area via a set of ramps and steps. Other areas include the Magazine Bastion, whose walls were breached by the French in 1782, ruins of the Royal Engineers' Quarters, ruins of the Artillery Officers' Quarters, Infantry Officers' Quarters, and the Orillon Bastion. The ruins of the barracks are a short walk from the car parking area.

Early life  Antonov was born in Moscow in 1889 to Nataliia Ivanovna Sokolova and Stepan Gavrilovich Antonov, however his family moved to Kirsanov in his father's native Tambov Governorate soon after his birth. Parish documents record the family as lower middle-class. In Kirsanov, Nataliia worked as a seamstress and milliner and Stepan, a former non-commissioned officer in the Russian army, worked as a tinker, although his business was unsuccessful. Antonov had two elder sisters, Valentina and Anna, and a younger brother . As a teenager he worked for a local grain trader. His mother died when he was about 16 years old. He had moved out of home by the time Stepan and Dimitri moved to Inzhavino in 1907 or 1908.  Entry into politics  It is unknown exactly when Antonov became involved in radical politics. At some point he joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party. He first appears on police records as a known revolutionary in 1908, when he travelled to Tambov to establish connections between his group and the Tambov Socialist Revolutionaries. Antonov became an \\"expropriator\\", someone who carried out robberies to support the revolutionary cause (called \\"expropriations\\" by revolutionaries). Antonov is associated with the robbery of a railway station in Inzhavino, where a note was left stating the exact amount taken \\"by the party of anarchists-individualists\\", signed by \\"a member of the party\\". He was also involved in the robbery of a bank in Kaninskii, where the amount taken was entered into the accounts book as being confiscated by \\"the Volga Union of Independent Socialist-Revolutionaries\\". On 20 February 1909, Antonov was arrested in Saratov, during a investigation into a plot to assassinate the commander-in-chief of the Kazan region, General Sadetskii. He does not appear to have been involved in this plot, but was imprisoned for his involvement in robberies. He was given 20 years of katorga, spending the first part of his sentence in the Schlisselburg fortress and the rest in Vladimirsky Central.  February Revolution and the Kirsanov Republic  In February 1917, Antonov was released from prison by the amnesty for political prisoners proclaimed by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution. He initially stayed with his sister Valentina in the city of Tambov, taking around a month to recover his health from his time in prison. Antonov began working for the Militia, the new law enforcement organisation replacing the Tsarist Police. He had useful connections in the political circumstances, for instance his defence lawyer from his trial in 1910, V. P. Isheev, was now Chair of the Tambov Municipal Duma. On May 13, the Duma representatives of Kirsanov declared the town to be an independent republic. A leading figure in this was the businessman A. K. Trunin, who declared himself \\"Procurer-General\\". This was not the result of a popular movement, unrelated to other declarations of local republics in provincial towns or the seizure of land from estates. The political nature of the \\"Kirsanov Republic\\" is unclear besides its opposition to the Provisional Government, with various sources calling it \\"bourgeois\\", \\"anarchist\\", \\"bolshevik\\" or \\"blackhundred\\". Antonov was chosen to lead a contingent of Militia to arrest the leaders of this \\"republic\\". Antonov's men encountered a large crowd outside the municipal Duma building in Kirsanov, their attempt to arrest Trunin was resisted and eventually led to a shootout. The \\"republicans\\" surrendered, but a crowd assailed Antonov's group and freed them, simultaneously arresting Antonov. The local army garrison intervened to arrest Trunin and restore order, however the incident had led to 8 deaths. In October, officials of the Kirsanov uezd requested that Antonov be made head of the uezd Militia. Around this time Antonov married his girlfriend, Sofiia Vasil'evna Orlova-Bogoliubskaia. Sofiia's brother Aleksandr also had connections to Kirsanov, and similarly to Antonov had been involved in \\"expropriations\\" before the revolution. Antonov left his new wife in Tambov to take up his new appointment in Kirsanov.  October Revolution, Tambov Rebellion and death  When the Bolsheviks seized power in November, there was no Bolshevik presence in the Kirsanov, where the Duma was dominated by liberals and moderate Socialists and the Soviet by Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. There was a gradual transfer of power from the Duma to the Soviet. The Bolshevik presence in Kirsanov began to grow as Bolshevik- supporting soldiers returned from World War I, and the Bolshevik regime began to impose its control on the countryside. A branch of the Cheka was founded in Kirsanov in April 1918. Non-Bolshevik officials like Antonov were placed under pressure to align themselves with the regime or leave their posts. It is known that Antonov eventually joined the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who were initially aligned with the Bolshevik regime, however he had little involvement in their party implying this was probably a pragmatic decision to keep his position. In Kirsanov he organised and became one of the leaders of the Tambov Rebellion against the Bolshevik regime. On 24 June 1922, cornered by a Cheka detachment near the village of Shybriay near Borisoglebsk, he was killed in a firefight along with his brother, Dmitriy. Documents state that he fought to the end, never laying down his weapon. Antonov was buried in Tambov, along with the other members of his group and his brother Dmitriy, near the walls of the monastery Kazan Mother of God on the fifth day after he perished.

These monoecious, evergreen trees are perennials or semiperennials. These are large trees, tall, with spreading, drooping, and rising branches. The leaves are alternate, lobate, ovate to ovate-lanceolate with minute stipules. They are pubescent on both sides when young, but in a later stage they become glabrous. The inflorescence consists of terminal plumes of small, creamy white, bell-shaped, fragrant flowers, branching from the base. The flowers are usually bisexual, with a solitary pistillate flower at the end of each major axis. The lateral cymes are staminate. There are five or six imbricate petals. The staminate flowers are mostly longer and thinner than the pistillate flowers, with 17-32 glabrous stamens in four whorls. The pistillate flowers have a superior ovary. The fruits are rather large drupes with a fleshy exocarp and a thin, woody endocarp. They vary in shape, according to the numbers of developed locules. They contain oleiferous, poisonous seeds. The oil has been used as a paraffin and lubricant, and as a constituent of varnish, paint, and soap. Once poisonous substances are removed, it can be used as a cooking oil. Some deciduous Chinese species are now classified under a separate genus Vernicia. The name Aleurites is derived from the meaning \\"wheaten flour\\" or \\"ground meal\\", because of the appearance of the lower surface of the leaf. Taxonomy and nomenclature Linnaeus assigned the Latin feminine grammatical gender to the genus name Aleurites, as for example in the species name Aleurites moluccana.

Ragnvald is mentioned in the regnal list of the Westrogothic law as the successor of King Inge the Younger. 17th century numismatic pioneer Elias Brenner erroneously ascribed coins to Ragnvald, but the coins on the left have been shown to have been minted for King Magnus IV of Sweden; Brenner's methods are not considered reliable on early medieval Swedish coins.\\"Brenners best√§mningsmetoder f√∂r mynten f√∂re 1300-talets mitt visar inga sp√•r av vetenskaplighet eller analytisk f√∂rm√•ga.

They are based instead on loose assumptions which include connecting individual letters on the coins to the names of kings. His parentage is uncertain: King Inge the Elder of Sweden had a son named Ragnvald,Lagerqvist & √Öberg in Kings and Rulers of Sweden p. 13 and historian Sven Tunberg has suggested him as identical with Ragnvald Knaph√∂vde.Professor Sven Tunberg in Ragnvald Knapph√∂vde, ett bidrag till diskussionen om Sveriges medeltida konungal√§ngd as published in Svensk tidskrift 1954, Almqvist & Wiksells, Upsala, pp. 35-40 However, another tradition presents King Ragnvald as the son of an Olof N√§skonung (Neskonungr meant \\"king of a ness\\" or \\"petty king\\", in Old Norse), and the regnal list of the Westrogothic law does not mention that Ragnvald had any connection with the old line of kings. Election and assassination Ragnvald Knaph√∂vde had been elected king by the Swedes in Uppland and then acknowledged by the East Gothlanders in √ñsterg√∂tland, but when he entered V√§sterg√∂tland, he did so without taking Geatish hostages. In Karleby, he was murdered by the Geats who instead had elected the Danish prince Magnus Nielsen who became King Magnus I of Sweden. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus explained later in the same century that the election of Magnus and the murder of a rightful king of Sweden was part of a Gothic (Geatish) plan to arrogate the right of electing the king from the Swedes: In the following century, in the Westrogothic law, the Geats would acknowledge that it was the Swedes who were entitled to elect and depose the king.Sve√¶r egho konong at taka ok sva vr√¶k√¶ (\\"it is the Swedes who have the right to elect king and to dethrone him\\"). In the regnal list of this law, they ignored the existence of any Magnus, but instead they defended the murder of Ragnvald as follows: Thus, the Geats explained the murder of Ragnvald as vengeance for his arrogant attitude towards them. After the death of King Magnus, the West Gothland region was ruled by jarls, probably under the nominal supremacy of Danish kings during a few decades until the Swedish king Sverker the Elder and after him the Swedish king Erik Jedvardsson were accepted there.The online article Sverige at the site of the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities, retrieved January 20, 2007. The 16th-century Swedish King John III would later have a damaged tombstone replaced for Ragnvald, over a grave at Vreta Abbey.

One place the technique is useful is where we wish to know the size of , but can find no direct way of counting its elements. By establishing a bijection from to some solves the problem if is more easily countable. Another useful feature of the technique is that the nature of the bijection itself often provides powerful insights into each or both of the sets. Basic examples = Proving the symmetry of the binomial coefficients = The symmetry of the binomial coefficients states that : {n \\\\choose k} = {n \\\\choose n-k}. This means that there are exactly as many combinations of things in a set of size as there are combinations of things in a set of size .  A bijective proof  The key idea of the proof may be understood from a simple example: selecting out of a group of children which to reward with ice cream cones has exactly the same effect as choosing instead the children to be denied them. More abstractly and generally, the two quantities asserted to be equal count the subsets of size and , respectively, of any -element set . Let be the set of all -element subsets of , the set has size \\\\tbinom{n}{k}. Let be the set of all subsets of , the set B has size \\\\tbinom{n}{n-k}. There is a simple bijection between the two sets and : it associates every -element subset (that is, a member of ) with its complement, which contains precisely the remaining elements of , and hence is a member of . More formally, this can be written using functional notation as, defined by for any -element subset of and the complement taken in . To show that f is a bijection, first assume that , that is to say, . Take the complements of each side (in ), using the fact that the complement of a complement of a set is the original set, to obtain . This shows that is one- to-one. Now take any -element subset of in , say . Its complement in , , is a -element subset, and so, an element of . Since , is also onto and thus a bijection. The result now follows since the existence of a bijection between these finite sets shows that they have the same size, that is, \\\\tbinom{n}{k} = \\\\tbinom{n}{n-k}.  Other examples  Problems that admit bijective proofs are not limited to binomial coefficient identities. As the complexity of the problem increases, a bijective proof can become very sophisticated. This technique is particularly useful in areas of discrete mathematics such as combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory. The most classical examples of bijective proofs in combinatorics include: * Pr√ºfer sequence, giving a proof of Cayley's formula for the number of labeled trees. * Robinson-Schensted algorithm, giving a proof of Burnside's formula for the symmetric group. * Conjugation of Young diagrams, giving a proof of a classical result on the number of certain integer partitions. * Bijective proofs of the pentagonal number theorem. * Bijective proofs of the formula for the Catalan numbers.

There are smaller, \\"travel\\" editions which have only 20 different faces. In 2008 and 2010, extra and mix and match games were released. A computer game based on the series was released in 1999 by Hasbro Interactive. Advertising In the United States, advertisements for the board game often showed the characters on the cards coming to life, and making witty comments to each other. This caused later editions of such ads to carry the spoken disclaimer line \\"game cards do not actually talk\\" in order to meet Federal Trade Commission advertising guidelines requiring full disclosure of toy features unable to be replicated with the actual product. Reception The Blaze noted that the major perk of playing the game is \\"watching your opponent [watch you] knock down several of the flipped up tiles with faces on them, putting you well on your way to guessing his or her main character\\". Criticism of lack of diversity Modern commentators have noted a bias toward white and male characters in Guess Who. In 2012, a six-year-old girl wrote to Hasbro asking why there were only five female characters to choose from, against nineteen male. Hasbro's response noted that each characteristic in the game - such as wearing glasses, or having red hair \\\\- deliberately appeared exactly five times, to which the child's parent asked \\"Why is female gender regarded as a 'characteristic', while male gender is not?\\" Despite the company's claim that players should \\"draw attention away from using gender or ethnicity as the focal point\\", the child's mother pointed out that physical differences of humans was the whole point of the game. The Huffington Post noted that one source had deemed the remarks \\"tone-deaf\\". Blogger Avital Norman Nathman suggested that the decision to include five women in the game wasn't a conscious choice, which she argues is a problem in itself. Some editions of the game since the early 2000s have included more women. The original version of Guess Who featured only one non- white character Anne, who was redrawn in a subsequent edition as a white woman. More recently, Hasbro has redesigned the board to feature a more racially diverse set of people.

Magnus I (; Bricka, Carl Frederik, Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, vol. XI [Maar ‚Äì M√ºllner], 1897, pp.45. Available online) (about 1106 ‚Äì 4 June 1134 in the Battle of Fotevik), was a Danish duke who ruled Gothenland in southern Sweden from the 1120s to c. 1132. His status as ruler of Sweden was disputed in his own time, but today he is recognized as one of the historical Swedish monarchs.Kings and Rulers of Sweden pp. 3 & 15Swedish Royal Court official list of monarchs Snorri Sturlason gives him the epithet Magnus the Strong.  Youth and appearance  Magnus was the son of King Niels I of Denmark and Margaret Fredkulla, the second or eldest daughter of King Inge the Elder of Sweden. His elder brother Inge was killed in a riding accident, leaving Magnus as the sole heir to Niels.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kronike, II, p. 55-6. He grew up to be a tall and strong young man, a head taller than anyone else. The chronicles give different opinions about his character, depending on their political preferences. The near-contemporary Roskilde Chronicle calls him merry and generous and a \\"lover of firmness in character\\". Saxo Grammaticus, on the other hand, says that he was well endowed by nature but still a violent brute.Gillingstam, \\"Magnus Nilsson\\".  The road to kingship  When Margaret's first cousin King Inge the Younger died at an unknown time in the 1120s, Magnus claimed the throne as the eldest grandson of Inge the Elder. According to the chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Magnus was recognized by the Geats (G√∂tarna) of Gothenland, but according to the Westrogothic law, the prerogatives of selecting a king lay with the Svear, another tribe to the north of the Geats. The Svear, on their part, had selected Ragnvald Knaph√∂vde, whose saga was however short. According to the brief chronicle incorporated in the Westrogothic law, Ragnvald showed disrespect towards the Geats by not giving hostages when riding his tour of installation.V√§stg√∂talagen, http://project2.sol.lu.se/fornsvenska/01_Bitar/A.L5.D-Vidhem.html In retaliation, Ragnvald was murdered by the Geatish population, an event sometimes dated to c. 1129.Sawyer, N√§r Sverige blev Sverige, pp. 38-9. \\"At his death\\", according to Saxo, \\"power was transferred to Magnus\\".Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kronike, II, p. 64. Magnus is not mentioned as King in the Westrogothic law, nor in any Swedish king-list, leaving a question-mark around his actual sphere of power.Tunberg, Sveriges historia till v√•ra dagar, II, p. 39. The law-speaker of V√§sterg√∂tland, Karl of Edsv√§ra, governed his province around this time and is occasionally known in the sources as jarl or even \\"king\\".Sawyer, N√§r Sverige blev Sverige, p. 39.  Reign  The few sources from this period indicate that Christianity was still not implemented everywhere. The Bishop of Uppsala, Siwardus, was appointed by the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen in 1123, but forced to flee \\"by pagans\\" in 1130. Another bishop, Henry, was then appointed in Sigtuna by the Danish Archbishop Asser, and appears as a strong supporter of Magnus. The alterations also indicate the clerical rivalry between Hamburg-Bremen and the Danish archbishopric. There is also a story in Saxo's chronicle that Magnus at one time undertook a belated Viking expedition to a part of Sweden, and brought back a few heavy Thor's Hammers which he had robbed on a holy island. The still insufficiently Christianized Swedes henceforth saw him as a temple defiler who had robbed the gods.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kronike, II, p. 66. Around 1127, Magnus married Richeza, daughter of Boleslaw III of Poland. The couple had two sons, Canute (born 1129, later to become king of Denmark) and Niels (born 1130). In 1130, Magnus backed Boleslaw III in conquering R√ºgen. The Polish forces together with a Danish fleet compelled the Rani to recognize Polish rule over the island.Edmund Kosiarz, Wojny na Ba≈Çtyku X‚ÄìXIX w., Gda≈Ñsk 1978, p. 38.  Civil war in Denmark  In 1131, Magnus had his cousin and potential rival for the Danish throne, Canute Lavard, murdered. After this deed he had to return to Gothenland, where he was still recognised as king. Though he was eventually backed by Niels, Magnus found himself in a civil war against Lavard's half- brother Eric Emune. The civil war weakened Magnus's position in Sweden. The Swedes chose a landowner from √ñsterg√∂tland, Sverker I, to be their king.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kronike, II, p. 81. According to Saxo's chronology of events this happened around 1132. Magnus and his father Niels eventually engaged the enemy in the Battle of Fotevik in Scania on 4 June 1134. According to Saxo, Niels panicked and fled when Eric approached, but Magnus confronted his adversaries with a small troop of determined followers. \\"He preferred death to escape in order not to eclipse his old reputation for courage. Finally, when he had fought rashly and killed many enemies, he fell over the heap of corpses that had piled up around him.\\"Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kronike, II, p. 84. After the decisive defeat, Niels escaped with his ships but was killed later the same year.  Legacy  Vreta in the 16th century but is a cenotaph. The location of his actual burial is not known. After Magnus's death, his widow Richeza returned to the other side of the Baltic Sea where she married Volodar of Minsk, a Rurikid ruler of Viking origins. She later returned to Sweden and thirdly married the man who defeated Magnus, King Sverker I. Magnus's son, Canute V, contested the Danish throne with his second cousin, Svend III. When Canute died in 1157, Magnus's legitimate descent became extinct. Canute's elder son Niels died in 1180. Canute's illegitimate posthumous son, Valdemar, bishop of Schleswig and Prince-Archbishop of Bremen, died in 1236 as the last descendant of king Magnus.

He started out in 1964 as a visual poet but soon jumped from the page to the screen within the sense of post-structuralist methodology. Thanks to this linguistic input into his visual media works, Weibel developed a critical impulse that turned against society and the media, while investigating virtual reality and other digital art forms.Weibel, Peter. 1990. Virtual Worlds: The Emperor‚Äôs New Bodies. Edited by Gottfried Hattinger, Morgan Russel, Christine Sch√∂pf, Peter Weibel. Linz: Veritas-Verlag Linz Since 1999 he has been director of the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. Biography Raised in Upper Austria he started to study French and cinematography in Paris. In 1964 he began to study medicine in Vienna, but changed soon to mathematics, with an emphasis on logic. Peter Weibel‚Äôs oeuvre belong in the following categories: conceptual art, performance, experimental film, video art and computer art. Starting in 1965 from semiotic and linguistic reflections (Austin, Jakobson, Peirce, Wittgenstein), Peter Weibel developed an artistic language, which led him from experimental literature to performance. In his performative actions, he has explored not only the \\"media\\" language and body, but also film, video, television, audiotape and interactive electronic environments. Critically he analyzed their function for the construction of reality. Besides taking part in happenings with members of the Vienna Actionism, he developed from 1967 (together with Valie Export, Ernst Schmidt Jr. and Hans Scheugl) an \\"expanded cinema\\" inspired by the American one and reflects the ideological and technological conditions of cinematic representation. Weibel elaborated on these reflections, from 1969, in his video tapes and installations. With his television action \\"tv und vt works\\", which was broadcast by the Austrian Television (ORF) in 1972, he transcended the borders of the gallery space and queried video technology in its application as a mass medium. In 1966 he was with Gustav Metzger, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Hermann Nitsch and others a participant of the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS) in London. Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS), London, 1966. Peter Weibel followed his artistic aims using a large variety of materials, forms and techniques: text, sculpture, installation, film and video. In 1978 he turned to music. Together with Loys Egg, he founded the band \\"Hotel Morphila Orchester\\" (orchestra). In the mid-1980s, he explored the possibilities of computer-aided video processing. Beginning of the 1990s he realized interactive computer-based installations. Here again he addressed the relation between media and the construction of reality. In his lectures and articles, Weibel commented on contemporary art, media history, media theory, film, video art and philosophy. As theoretician and curator, he pleaded for a form of art and art history that includes history of technology and history of science. In his function as a university professor and director of institutions like the Ars Electronica (in Linz, Austria), the Institute for New Media in Frankfurt and the ZKM  Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, he influenced the European Scene of the so-called computer art through conferences, exhibitions and publications.Wolf Lieser. Digital Art. Langenscheidt: h.f. ullmann. 2009. p. 38. Research and teaching From 1976, Peter Weibel taught at numerous universities, among others at the Universit√§t f√ºr Angewandte Kunst in Vienna, the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and the Gesamthochschule Kassel. In 1984 he was appointed to teach for five years as Associate Professor for Video and Digital Arts at the Center for Media Study at the State University of New York in Buffalo, New York. The same year, 1984 he became Professor for visual media at the Universit√§t f√ºr Angewandte Kunst in Vienna. In 1989 he was assigned to set up the Institute for New Media at the St√§delschule in Frankfurt, which he headed until 1994.  Curatorial activities  Since 1986 Weibel worked as artistic advisor for the Ars Electronica, which he then headed from 1992 until 1995 as its artistic director. From 1993 to 1999, he curated the pavilion of Austria on the Venice Biennial. In the same period, from 1993 to 1999, he worked as chief curator at the Neue Galerie am Landesmuseum Joanneum in Graz, Austria. Since January 1999 Peter Weibel was Chairman and CEO of the ZKM Center for Art and Media.

It was first published in 1986. The stories' protagonists are two toddler brothers who like to cause double the trouble wherever they go. The artist when the strip first started was Barrie Appleby, who continued until 2004 with a strip by Gordon Bell in the 1994 annual and a sole strip by Nigel Parkinson in 2003, who took over the strip next year as part of the revamp at that time. History of the comic Cuddles and Dimples actually started out as two separate strips. While Dimples started out in The Dandy on 27 October 1984, Cuddles had already been in Nutty since March 1981. When Nutty merged with The Dandy in 1985, Cuddles did not follow, instead becoming the cover character of Hoot. Hoot combined with The Dandy the following year, and the first Cuddles and Dimples story showed Cuddles' family moving to Dandytown, where he met Dimples. This took place in issue 2345, dated 1 November 1986. By late 1987, without explanation, one set of parents disappeared (Cuddles'), and the toddlers were said to be twins. Grounds for this change had been somewhat prepared previously by a short-lived spin-off strip called \\"That's Our Granny\\" which established that the two boys shared a grandmother. For many years, the characters appeared in the centre pages (with full colour) of The Dandy. When they first appeared, they appeared in pages 16 and 17 of the then 20-page comic with red and black as the only colours. The characters took over the front page of The Dandy from issue 3008 (July 1999) until October 2000, when they got 'thrown out' for misbehaving too much (in reality, readers wanted Desperate Dan back on the cover). They were both preceded and succeeded on the cover by Desperate Dan. By the time of the revamp in October 2004, Cuddles and Dimples were assigned to Nigel Parkinson to freshen up their look (prior to the new look, the strip had been reprinted since early 2004). Dimples was made the older brother and now has a patch of Brown Hair. He also became vaguely intelligent. Cuddles look was toned down from the grotesque little monster he was before, and was made the younger, more naive and disgusting brother. Both of them appeared slightly less childish; for example, they no longer called their parents \\"Mumsie and Daddums\\", instead calling them Mum and Dad. Their parents were also revamped, dad being a pot-bellied balding idiot and mum an up-to-date babe or a yummy mummy. The strip was axed with The Dandys revamp in October 2010; however, they returned in reprints from February 2012 onwards.

After co-winning Tough Enough III with John Hennigan, he worked in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the primary developmental territory for WWE. He ended his career due to a malignant brain tumor. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Entertainment= Tough Enough Cappotelli, along with John Hennigan, won a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) contract by winning Tough Enough III. During the show Hardcore Holly aggressively roughed up Matt while training, stiffly striking Cappotelli repeatedly, leaving him bleeding. After winning, he made sporadic appearances on WWE shows. At Vengeance Cappotelli competed in The APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl which Bradshaw won. =Ohio Valley Wrestling= Cappotelli was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, he formed a tag team known as The Thrill Seekers with Johnny Jeter. On November 9 at an OVW television taping, Cappotelli captured the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating his former tag team partner, Johnny Jeter. On February 8, 2006, he announced that he had previously been diagnosed with a grade 2/3 astrocytoma and surrendered the title to OVW owner Danny Davis at a television taping in Louisville, Kentucky. Cappotelli announced to OVW wrestlers and fans on April 4, 2007 that he would undergo surgery for brain cancer in Boston on May 1. WWE's official website later reported that the surgery was a success, and that the majority of the brain tumor was removed. He was released from his contract in January 2009. Toward the end of 2013, Cappotelli became the trainer for OVW's Beginner Program. Personal life and death Cappotelli attended college at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he was also a member of the football team. Cappotelli was married to Lindsay. They resided in Louisville, Kentucky, where he also worked as a personal trainer. He was close friends with professional wrestler and Western Michigan alumnus, Colt Cabana.

It measures approximately 13x16 miles (22x26 kilometres) and has a maximum elevation of 3,002 m at its highest point, Sapitwa Peak. Much of the Massif consists of rolling grassland at elevations of 1800‚Äì2200 m, intersected by deep forested ravines. It has many individual peaks reaching heights of over 2500 m, including Chambe Peak, the West Face of which is the longest rock climb in Africa. The Massif was formed by the intrusion of magma into the Earth's crust about 130 million years ago. The surrounding rock eroded away over time, leaving behind the erosion-resistant igneous rock of the Mulanje Massif. The first European to report seeing the Massif was David Livingstone in 1859, but archeological investigation reveals evidence of human visits to the Massif from the Stone Age onwards. The elevation of the mountain is high enough for it to disturb upper level air flow and induce rain clouds to form around it, making it an important source of rain water at the head of almost every river that runs through this part of Malawi. The forested slopes of the Massif support a sizeable timber industry. At one time there was a cableway to transport timber from the edge of the plateau down to the Likhubula Forestry Station but it fell into disrepair and currently planks are carried down manually. The mountain itself is part of the protected Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve. The native Mulanje cypress (Widdringtonia whytei) has been so heavily logged that it is considered endangered and the park contains the last remaining stands of this tree, as well as a number of other plant and animal species‚Äîmany of them endemic to the area. Examples include forest butterflies, birds such as the cholo alethe and white-winged apalis, a dwarf chameleon, geckos, skinks, the squeaker frog, and a rare limbless burrowing skink species. The land around the park is threatened by growing population, land use patterns such as forest clearing for farming and firewood, and invasive species such as golden Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipticus) and Mexican weeping pine (Pinus patula). The Massif is popular for hiking and climbing, and has several mountain huts scattered across it which are maintained by the Malawi Mountain Club and the Malawi Forestry Department. Sapitwa peak was first climbed in 1894, and is now the most popular climb on the plateau. In 2014 the site was unsuccessfully nominated for World Heritage Status.UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 38th Session, Doha: Decision : 38 COM 8B.18 Mount Mulanje Cultural Landscape (Malawi) The human history of the Mulanje Area According to Chewa legend, the people living in Malawi before their arrival were the Akafula. Although yet to be found on Mulanje, rock art has been discovered on the nearby hills at Machemba and Mikolongwe. Recent work by the Catholic University has unearthed tool-making sites along the Thuchila shelf dating back to the Middle Stone Age, some 100,000 years ago. The main Bantu immigration came from the Congo Basin in the 1600s, with the Mang'anja people settling in a number of sites around the Mulanje Area. These were peaceful people who built a livelihood from the soil and local natural resources. There was contact with the outside world through the coastal Arabs and Portuguese, and Yao traders who brought in goods to exchange for ivory and slaves. The peacefulness came to an end with the migration of Yao people from the north- east towards the south shore of Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) and highland areas of Malawi in the 1800s, escaping from their own internal tribal strife. With the strong coastal demand, slave raiding into the Mang'anja villages sharply increased and the settlements were often scattered. This situation was noted by David Livingstone when he travelled into this area in the middle of the nineteenth century. Livingstone's call for help in ending the slave trade brought Scottish missionaries and settlers into the area who established themselves by setting up a mission on the slopes of the mountain and in estate agriculture, respectively. Despite attempts at developing an amicable relationship, conflict with the Yao increased and this soon led to violence. By the 1890s, the British had seen the need to establish a protectorate and they set up a military administration at the north of the mountain at Fort Lister and to the south at Fort Anderson. The staffing of these forts with Indian soldiers started Malawi's now longstanding links with the Indian sub- continent. From this time, there were also inward migrations of the Lomwe people from the Portuguese east, escaping both colonial and Yao strife, who largely settled among the European estates and the Catholic missions. This immigration has continued to recent times during the Mozambican independence and civil wars. Today, these three tribal cultures continue to live around the Mountain in one of the highest rural population densities in Africa. Although there is territorial distinction through their tribal traditional authorities, there is a widespread intermixing of the peoples. European settlement flourished to develop the extensive tea estates that represent the first significant cultivation of this crop outside its countries of origin. The missions also continue to expand their services in education and primary health care.  Climate  Mulanje Massif 3D The climate of the larger Mulanje area is strongly influenced by the equatorial low pressure area, where the north-east trades of the Northern Hemisphere converge with the south-east trades of the Southern Hemisphere. This area is known as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). On satellite Images the ITCZ is mostly seen as a long band of clouds in the Equatorial region, the main effect of the ITCZ is the creation of dry and rainy seasons in the Equatorial area. The Mulanje Massif, because its unique position as a ‚Äúmountain island‚Äù rising more than 2,500 metres above the surrounding plains, is strongly affected by the ITCZ, acting as a rain barrier. This becomes very visible when comparing the annual normal rainfalls, on and around the massif. The plateau level, at around 2,000 metres above sea level, annually experiences more than 2500 mm (100 inches) of rain, however, in the low plains around the foot of the Massif, the annual rainfalls range around 40 inches. In the plains around the Mountain it normally only rains in the rainy season, while it rains year round on the plateau level. Mount Mulanje in the distance, seen from a pathway. There are still differences in the amounts of rain around the Massif. The south-west face of the mountain around Likhubula, Lichenya and Mulanje Boma is the windward side. This experiences the highest amounts of rain due to the south-east trades of the southern hemisphere that drive the moist air from Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo into the Mulanje region. The north-west face of the Massif experiences lesser rains, due to a rain-shadow effect. The months of the dry season (May‚ÄìAugust) are the coolest months of the year and most suitable for hiking in the massif. The wet season (November‚ÄìApril) is not recommended for hiking in the Massif, as the hiker faces heavy rains on the plateau and high temperatures during the ascent. Western side of Mulanje Mountain in Sunset, seen from Likhubula Falls Snow is a very rare event. Brief snowfalls are possible but the last major snowfall with ground accumulation was in June 1954.  The Mulanje cedar  The Mulanje cedar (Widdringtonia whytei) was proclaimed the National Tree of Malawi in 1984 by the late president Hastings Banda. This tall tree, W. whytei, was named after one Alexander Whyte, a colonial government botanist in Nyasaland. The species was first described in 1894 and it is only found on Mount Mulanje (and Mchese Mountain, depending on if that population is considered conspecific). Scientists disagree about whether this is a distinct species or a giant form of the other cedar found on the mountain, W. nodiflora, which is common across Southern Africa. The cedar forests on Mulanje were estimated in 2004 to have been reduced to a total area of 8.5 km2, half of the estimated original forest cover. This area may have been diminished as a result of continued illegal cutting. W. whytei is a large evergreen tree, growing up to 40‚Äì50 m tall, whereas W. nodiflora is more rounded, with a lower canopy height. On the mountain, the Mulanje cedar is limited to altitudes between 1,800-2,550 m and is normally confined to hollows and valleys where there is some protection from fire. Cedar timber is pale red, straight grained and pleasantly fragrant. Its major qualities are that it is worked easily and is extremely durable, being naturally resistant to attacks from termites, wood-boring insects and fungi. The sap is poisonous to insects. For these reasons, the timber achieved commercial significance from the 1980s onward, becoming a principal resource for building and woodworking. As of 2010 the timber is most used in the making of local arts and crafts, fishing boats for Lake Malawi, and in the construction and decoration of many prestigious buildings. As the demand for its timber is high, the tree is under threat of extinction. Mulanje cedar is a pioneer species, not a climax species, meaning that it is good at taking advantage of sites that become free of other competing species but it is not successful in open competition. When fire destroys the trees in an area of woodland, Mulanje cedar will normally be the first tree species to re- establish itself. Other species will come in later, but because the cedar is relatively fast growing, it will not face much competition for sunlight. The Malawi Department of Forestry is responsible for protecting the cedar forests from damaging fires. Each year, at the beginning of the dry season, firebreaks are cleared of vegetation to provide barriers that will impede the advance of wildfires. In addition, controlled early burning is carried out to reduce the build-up of combustible material that might cause intense and damaging fires later in the dry season. For further safety, gangs equipped with fire-fighting equipment are stationed on each of the main plateau areas whenever there is a fire hazard. As well as providing protection from fires, the Department of Forestry is responsible for controlling the use of the trees for timber. In the past the department issued annual sawing licences but, due to a sharp increase in illegal harvesting, the sawing season has been closed since 2007. However, the illegal market for cedar is strong and cedar harvesting has not yet been stopped. All cedar wood sawn after 2007 is illegal wood, and can be confiscated by Forestry and the Malawi Police. In 2010 there was a significant increase in law enforcement action involving armed forestry teams patrolling the cedar forests to stop the illegal pit sawyers. There has also been a substantial planting programme to reforest Mulanje cedar seedlings in the plastic-covered greenhouses that can be seen across the mountain. In the 2008/09 rainy season, nurseries were established on the mountain to raise over 50,000 seedlings that were then planted out with an estimated survival rate of over 30%. In the 2009/10 season, nursery plans were to raise more than 20,000 seedlings, with an improved planting-out strategy to ensure an even higher success rate. Conservation of the cedars is not secure. In 2010 the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust (MMCT) claimed the species would probably be extinct by 2020. Mulanje cedar was first assessed as 'endangered' in 1997, and again in 1998, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).No author. Widdringtonia whytei. Downloaded on 10 July 2007.Conifer Specialist Group 1998. Widdringtonia whytei. Downloaded on 10 July 2007. It was re- assessed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN in 2011, wherein the assessor, Aljos Farjon, based on the 2004 data, stated that the species would experience a population reduction of 80% by 2030. In 2019 it was again assessed as 'critically endangered', with the authors claiming that there were less than 50 mature trees left, and blaming this on foreign export. They make this claim based on the area being near the border, what they claim is bad policing by Malawi, and their claim that the wood is not used or sold in Malawi. Despite these assertions, the Malawi government and partners such as the MMCT have planted some 250,000 seedlings each year for the past few years as of 2019. In addition to the risk of losing this tree, there is also the potential loss of the other endemic plant and animal species that inhabit these unique forests.

It collected duties on behalf of the King (plus hefty bonus fees for themselves), under renewable six-year contracts. The major tax collectors in that highly unpopular tax farming system were known as the fermiers g√©n√©raux (singular fermier g√©n√©ral), which would be tax farmers-general in English.This article is largely from :fr:Ferme g√©n√©rale, which cites: Marie-Nicolas Bouillet and Alexis Chassang (eds), Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de g√©ographie, 1878. In the 17th and 18th centuries the fermiers g√©n√©raux became immensely rich and figure prominently in the history of cultural patronage, as supporters of French music, major collectors of paintings and sculpture, patrons of the marchands-merciers and consumers of the luxury arts in the vanguard of Parisian fashions. In his 1833 novel Ferragus, writer Honor√© de Balzac attributes the sad air that hangs about the √éle Saint-Louis in central Paris to the many houses there owned by fermiers g√©n√©raux. Their sons or grandsons purchased patents of nobility and their daughters often married into the aristocracy. Especially members of impoverished aristocratic families were eager to marry daughters of the fermiers g√©n√©raux in order to restore the wealth they had prior to their ruin. This was called in popular French redorer son blason (literally \\"to re-gild one's coat of arms\\").Le petit Larousse 2013, p932 History Before the French Revolution in 1789, the public revenue was based largely on the following taxes: *The Taille ‚Äì Direct land tax imposed on French peasant and non-noble households, based on how much land they held. In some provinces, the principle of taille r√©elle was used, which meant that the tax was based on the actual market value of the real estate. In a majority of provinces the taille personnelle was applied: the tax level was the result of an arbitrary and gross estimation of the real estate value. Noblemen, public office holders and the inhabitants of the large cities were exempt from the taille. *The Taillon ‚Äì Tax for military expenditure. *The Vingti√®me (one- twentieth) ‚Äì Based solely on revenue (5 percent of net earnings from land, property, commerce, industry and from official offices). *The Gabelle ‚Äì A very complicated system of taxes and outsourced regional monopolies on salt, with enormous price disparities between the different provinces (e.g. the salt price in Paris was thirty times higher than in Brittany) that were a strong enticement to smuggling. *The Aides ‚Äì National tariffs on various products, including wine and tobacco. *The Traites ‚Äì Custom duties for either the import or export of goods to and from France, or for the transport of goods from one French province to the neighbouring one (internal customs). *The Octroi ‚Äì A local tariff levied on products entering the cities, especially Paris. *The Droits f√©odaux (feudal rights), a long list of petty duties for every possible event or activity in a peasant's life (the right to marry, to inherit, to use the mill, to use the roads of the local aristocrat, to be exempt from doing mandatory chores for the local lord, etc.), to be paid to the local lord, the King or both and generally considered by the peasant to be arbitrary and humiliating. *The D√Æme (\\"the tenth [part]) ‚Äì A mandatory tithe to support the state church and its clergy, collected by the local vicars, monks or bishops (and so, not a tax in the legal sense). The D√Æme had to be paid either in legal tender (money) or in material assets by all residents regardless of their religion. =Tax farming before Colbert= The Ferme g√©n√©rale developed at a time when the monarchy suffered from chronic financial difficulties. The Affermage (leasing, outsourcing) of the collection of the traite (customs duties and taxes) had the advantage of guaranteeing the Treasury foreseeable and regular receipts, while reducing the perception of its role in tax- collection. The rights were initially contracted separately to various tax farmers, who were named traitants (who had the right to collect the traite) or partisans (who had a share (partie) in the collection of the traite). They were obliged to pay to the Royal Treasury the sum stipulated in their lease, and they received a share of the income and a share of any \\"unexpected\\" surplus. Each right was leased separately, which caused great administrative complexity: the taking of goods out of bond could involve several tax farms. Prior to 1598, this system had developed so that the tax farms were allocated among five pays (parts of France). In 1598 the Superintendent of Finances, the Duke of Sully, entrusted tax collection to one farm instead of five separate ones, and subjected the collection of duties raised in the provinces to the rights of the King. The single tax farm was called the Cinq Grosses Fermes (five large farms). In 1607, he issued new rules (R√®glement G√©n√©ral sur les Traites) on the collection of duties in an attempt to harmonize procedures. He also attempted to constitute the whole of France into a single customs area, but was without success, as the provinces \\"considered foreign\\" (i.e. which became part of France after the foundation of the Kingdom; especially the south and Brittany) refused to merge with the zone covered by the Cinq Grosses Fermes. By the middle of the 17th century, France was divided for tax purposes into three principal zones: *Provinces of the Cinq Grosses Fermes without any internal customs duties (since 1664 by decision of Colbert) *Provinces \\"considered foreign\\" and therefore had negotiated lower rates on some taxes *Provinces \\"effectively following the example of the provinces considered foreign\\" (i.e. the last to become part of France; especially Lorraine and Alsatia) which formed tax-free zones when doing trade with the neighbouring foreign countries. Not all fermiers-g√©n√©raux constrained their viewpoint to their own enrichment: Pierre-Paul Riquet, appointed collector in Languedoc- Roussillon in 1630, used his fortune to build the Canal du Midi that links the Mediterranean coast of France to Toulouse and then on to the system of canals and rivers that ran across to the Bay of Biscay on the Atlantic coast, considered to be one of the great engineering feats of the 17th century. =The farm under Colbert: traitants and partisans= The process was further developed under the aegis of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Minister of Finance to King Louis XIV. To reduce the number of these farmers and to increase the share of the collection transferred to the Royal Treasury, Colbert sought to gather a great number of rights together in fermes g√©n√©rales (general farms). The first fermes g√©n√©rales was instituted in 1680 to collect gabelles, aides, taille and douane . Although sometimes of obscure origin, the financiers which took these rights often quickly accumulated immense fortunes which enabled them to play a significant political and social role. Their greed and excesses shocked the public and were often turned into objects of ridicule in literature, for example by playwright Alain-Ren√© Lesage in his 1709 comedy Turcaret, which was inspired by financier Paul Poisson de Bourvallais. =The Ferme g√©n√©rale (1726‚Äì90)= In 1726, all the existing farms were gathered in a single lease. The forty farmers-general, who held guarantees as contractors of the lease, became powerful and fabulously rich. Examples of the first generation of these tax farmers include Antoine Crozat, the first private owner of French Louisiana, the four P√¢ris brothers, and Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelini√®re. Increased criticism of the Ferme g√©n√©rale system led the government to introduce new regulations in 1769, which turned the collection of taxes and the administration of the service to which taxation was entrusted to public organisations, with their managers receiving a fixed remuneration. The public career of the reforming economist Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot began with his appointment in 1761 as intendant of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Limoges. In 1780, at the initiative of Jacques Necker, finance minister to Louis XVI, indirect taxes were distributed between three tax farm companies: the Ferme g√©n√©rale (for customs duties), the Ligue g√©n√©rale (for taxes on alcohol) and the Administration g√©n√©rale des domaines et des droits domaniaux (for land taxes and fees for land registration). By the end of the 18th century, the Ferme g√©n√©rale system became a symbol of an unequal society. The Ferme g√©n√©rale, and the great wealth of its proprietors, was seen as encapsulating all the perversions of the political and social system. People blamed the injustices and annoyances - which actually arose from the complexity of the tax system - on the company itself, including the brutality of tax collecting troops and the brutal repression of smuggling. The gabelle (tax on salt) was the most unpopular of all the taxes. The Ferme g√©n√©rale was thus one of the institutions of the Ancien R√©gime which was most criticised during the 1789 French Revolution. It was depicted as a group of predatory tyrants; the Girondist politician Antoine Fran√ßais de Nantes, made an early reputation for himself attacking this prominent target. The Ferme g√©n√©rale was then suppressed in 1790, with farmers-general paying the price at the scaffold: 28 former members of the consortium were guillotined on 8 May 1794. Among them was Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry, whose laboratory had been supported by income from his administration of the Ferme g√©n√©rale. His wife, the chemist Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, who escaped the guillotine, was herself the daughter of another farmer-general, Jacques Paulze. =Organisation= The lease of the Ferme g√©n√©rale was regulated by six-year contracts between the King and an individual who acted as a figurehead for the company. The Ferme g√©n√©rale held guarantee for the contractor. The number of partners was fixed at 40, after having reached nearly 90 earlier. The contractor committed himself to paying the Royal Treasury the amount of the lease and received in return any surplus. In 1780 an upper limit was set for this remuneration. The Ferme g√©n√©rale had its headquarters in Paris. In its central offices it employed nearly 700 people, including two chaplains. Its local operations included up to 42 provincial offices and nearly 25,000 agents distributed in two branches of activity; that of the offices which checked, liquidated and charged the fees and that of the guards' brigades which sought and suppressed smuggling with very severe punishments (such as hard labour or hanging). The employees of the Ferme g√©n√©rale were not royal civil servants but they acted in the name of the king, and therefore benefited from particular privileges and the protection of the law. In addition, members of the guards' brigades had the right to bear weapons. The managing of the company was handled collectively by the Ferme g√©n√©rale. They met as committees of experts and had control of the company's external services. The day before the French Revolution in 1789, almost all the rights of indirect drafts and rights (like the gabelle, the tax on tobacco, and a number of local taxes) were awarded. On the other hand, the Royal Treasury's income from the Ferme g√©n√©rale represented more than half of the total public revenue. The company had also built the 24-kilometre Wall of the Farmers-General between 1784 and 1791 in Paris to ensure the payment of taxes on goods entering the city. Criticism of tax collection methods The Ferme g√©n√©rale was one of the most hated components of the Ancien R√©gime because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents. Criticism of the Ferme g√©n√©rale also include: *Public bodies were deprived of a resource *Service rendered was not always better in the long term *The cost could be higher for the taxpayer, who paid his taxes plus the margin taken by the Ferme g√©n√©rale *The recovery of debts (of tax arrears) by the Ferme g√©n√©rale could be brutal *Depriving itself of a resource, the community became involved in debt, and had to find new taxes to obtain additional money Therefore, at the end of the 18th century, the French state had become involved in considerable debt, which factored among the causes of the French Revolution. Cultural role of farmers-general The farmers-general of the Ancien R√©gime figure prominently in the history of cultural patronage in France. The enlightened farmer-general Le Normant de Tournehem was the legal guardian of Madame de Pompadour, responsible for her education - in turn, thanks to her influence, he was made director-general of the B√¢timents du Roi in December 1745, and held the post, overseeing royal building works at the King's residences in and around Paris, until his death in 1751. As American architect Fiske Kimball observed, ‚ÄúWithout artistic prejudices, he was a man of ability, honesty and simplicity, who devoted himself to efficient administration\\".Kimball, Creation of the Rococo 1943, p. 186. Farmers-general also figured among prominent supporters of French music and collectors of paintings and sculpture, such as Pierre Grimod du Fort, and as patrons of the marchands-mercier, a type of merchants who dealt with decorative art objects. As consumers of luxurious art the farmers-general were at the vanguard of Parisian fashion, like Ange Laurent Lalive de Jully, a patron of arts who embraced the early form of neoclassicist style in decorative arts called the go√ªt grec (lit. \\"Greek taste\\"). Others merely made themselves notorious for their squander, like Ange Laurent's brother Denis Joseph de La Live d'√âpinay, the estranged husband of the writer and saloniste Louise d'√âpinay. The gourmand Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reyni√®re was the son of the farmer-general Laurent Grimod de La Reyni√®re. Sons or grandsons of farmer-generals often purchased patents of nobility, with their daughters marrying into aristocracy.Jean-Joseph de Laborde was one who purchased a marquisate for himself. Voltaire and the fermiers In his Voltaire, A LifeDavidson, Ian, 2010, Voltaire, A Life, London: Profile Books (pp. 427‚Äì31), Ian Davidson describes events on Voltaire's estate at Ferney, north of Geneva, in the 1770s. In 1770, hundreds of watchmakers fled the political ructions in Geneva and went to make a new life at Ferney. Voltaire helped them to set up a new watchmaking business. He negotiated a tax exemption for the watchmakers with the duc de Choiseul, Prime Minister of France. But by 1774, the business was prospering and the tax farmers started to take an interest. Three-way negotiations between the tax farmers, Voltaire and Turgot ensued. In December 1775, Turgot confirmed the watchmakers' exemption from the salt tax (gabelle) and from road maintenance duties (corv√©e) and a figure was agreed to compensate the tax farmers for loss of revenue. Voltaire addressed a public meeting on 12 December and the watchmakers accepted the settlement. Two days later, Voltaire wrote to his friend Mme de Saint-Julien: ... while we were gently passing our time in thanking M. Turgot, and while the whole province was busy drinking, the gendarmes of the tax farmers, whose time runs out on 1 January, had orders to sabotage us. They marched about in groups of fifty, stopped all the vehicles, searched all the pockets, forced their way into all the houses and made every kind of damage there in the name of the king, and made the peasants buy them off with money. I cannot conceive why the people did not ring the tocsin against them in all the villages, and why they were not exterminated. It is very strange that the ferme g√©n√©rale, with only another fortnight left for them to keep their troops here in winter quarters, should have permitted or even encouraged them in such criminal excesses. The decent people were very wise and held back the ordinary folk, who wanted to throw themselves on these brigands, as if on mad wolves. According to Davidson, good sense prevailed despite this violence, Voltaire was appointed a tax commissioner, profits peaked in 1776 and the watchmaking business survived the revolution and continued \\"well into the nineteenth century\\".

The characters' origins and histories were revised and updated circa mid-1990s for modern audiences. For instance, Ben Grimm fought as a pilot in the Gulf War instead of World War II, and Susan and Johnny Storm were explained to have been financial backers for Reed Richards' rocket, hence their presence on the mission. In addition, while Richards' goal of becoming the first man to get to Mars remained, it was revealed that he secretly aimed to explore the interstellar anomalies of that area. For this reworking, Marvel \\"farmed out\\" the properties to some of their former employees who had left the company to form Image Comics. Jim Lee's WildStorm Productions studios handled Fantastic Four and Iron Man, and Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios took the reins of The Avengers and Captain America. However, after six issues, Marvel ended Liefeld's contract early, citing low sales on his two titles. Liefeld's titles were reassigned to Lee. Walt Simonson took over Avengers when it moved to WildStorm. Although the four titles in \\"Heroes Reborn\\" were slated for a 12-issue run, James Robinson wrote a thirteenth and final issue for each book. The storyline, entitled \\"World War III\\", was a crossover between the Marvel and WildStorm characters. The changes to the characters were controversial, provoking debates amongst fans. The change in creative team on Captain America was also controversial, since the pre-Heroes Reborn team of Mark Waid and Ron Garney had already been bringing increased sales and critical acclaim to the series. However, all of the titles experienced a large upsurge in sales. According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them; Lee refused. At the end of the storyline, the Fantastic Four and Avengers were returned to the mainstream Marvel Universe, again through the intervention of Franklin Richards, in the miniseries Heroes Reborn: The Return. The ensuing storyline, dubbed \\"Heroes Return\\" was once again created in-house at Marvel Comics. =Cancelled and relaunched titles= * Fantastic Four #416 ‚Äì September 1996.

In the story, the Celestials took notice of Franklin's pocket universe and initially demanded that he now eliminate one of the two universes, but finally relented on the condition that all beings native to Earth-616 evacuate the pocket universe and never return. The heroes are gathered in a massive ship to leave the pocket universe. Characters as She-Hulk and several members of the Inhuman Royal Family were depicted as returning heroes, even though they were not among the missing heroes from Onslaught: Marvel Universe. As the heroes are travelling to their destination, Dr. Doom suddenly makes an escape out of the ship with Franklin, hoping to use the siphoning devices he created to steal Franklin's power. However, Doom is stopped by Mr. Fantastic and Thor who rescue the boy. Thor uses his hammer to create a portal, trapping himself and Doom on it. As soon as the remaining heroes break the boundaries between the two worlds, they all suddenly remember their past lives. Bruce Banner and the Hulk are merged back together into one singular being. The returned Anthony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Anthony Stark, and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them.Iron Man vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.

In July 2000, Marvel published the trade paperback Fantastic Four: Heroes Reborn, collecting Fantastic Four vol. 2, issues #1-6 under the 'Marvel's Finest' banner, but no other \\"Heroes Reborn\\" reprints followed for some time. With 2006 marking the 10th anniversary of the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" crossover, Marvel marked the occasion by having the reality-traversing Exiles team visit the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" Earth, in Exiles #81-82. The company also announced it was reprinting original \\"Heroes Reborn\\" series and produced trade paperbacks collecting issues 1-12 (excluding the series finale cross-over \\"World War III\\") of the four titles. A new edition of Heroes Reborn: Fantastic Four trade paperback was released in August 2018 . Also, Marvel announced that Jeph Loeb and Rob Liefeld would reunite in November 2006 for Onslaught Reborn, a five- part weekly limited series that would feature both Onslaught and a world similar to the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" universe. This was planned to tie in with the memorial scholarship fund established in honor of Loeb's son Sam. =Collected editions= *Return of the Heroes - collects Heroes Reborn: The Return #1-4 (1999, ) *Fantastic Four: Heroes Reborn TPB (Trade Paperback) - collects Fantastic Four vol. 2 #1-6 (2000, ) *Heroes Reborn: Avengers TPB - collects Avengers vol. 2 #1-12 (2006, ) *Heroes Reborn: Captain America TPB - collects Captain America vol. 2 #1-12 (2006, ) *Heroes Reborn: Fantastic Four TPB - collects Fantastic Four vol. 2 #1-12 (2006, ); second edition (August 2018, ) *Heroes Reborn: Iron Man TPB - collects Iron Man vol. 2 #1-12 (2006, ) *Heroes Reborn: The Return TPB - collects Heroes Return #1-4, Doomsday #1, Ashema #1, Masters of Evil #1, Rebel #1, Remnants #1, Young Allies #1, and Doom #1.

Hokie Stone fa√ßade detail, on O'Shaughnessy Hall. Hokie Stone is a grey dolomite‚Äîlimestone rock found near Blacksburg, in western Virginia. It gets its name from the traditional nickname attributed to students and alumni of Virginia Tech. Hokie Stone is quarried by Virginia Tech for campus projects and is prominently displayed on the majority of buildings throughout the Blacksburg campus. Geology Hokie Stone is limestone infused with magnesium and calcium under intense pressure and temperature. Hokie Stone with impurities such as siltstone and sandstone is multi-colored and found on some newer Blacksburg campus structures. South slope of the main quarry in Blacksburg. Quarry Eighty percent of the stone is quarried from a Virginia Tech-owned quarry a few miles from campus near the Highland Park subdivision of Blacksburg, Virginia. Twenty-five to thirty Virginia Tech employees use black powder each day to dislodge the stone, cut it into block sizes required by campus construction projects and then finish the blocks by hand using hammers and chisels. In 2010 Virginia Tech upgraded the quarry equipment to reduce costs, including the purchase of a computer- driven saw. Hokie Stone from this quarry can only be sold to Virginia Tech. The remaining 20% of stone, which is black, is mined once per year from an additional quarry located on a local farm near Lusters Gate. About 50 tons can be quarried each week. This university-owned quarry has been in operation since the 1950s. History The native woodland Indians are believed to have made tools from Hokie Stone. Collegiate Gothic style on Johnson Hall. modernist style on Pamplin Hall. Norris Hall ‚Äî with Hokie Stone fa√ßade. =At Virginia Tech= Buildings When the university was founded in 1872, buildings built in the Old Quad (now known as the Upper Quad) were red brick structures, reflecting the architecture of its first building, the Preston and Olin Building, a three story red brick edifice constructed in 1855 for the Preston and Olin Institute. The first Hokie Stone was cut in 1899 for the YMCA Building (present day Performing Arts Building), the first to be constructed of it. V.P.I.'s first native-limestone-clad, neo-Gothic style building, known as The Chapel, was later constructed on the site where Newman Library stands today. Agricultural Hall or \\"Old Aggie\\" (now known as Price Hall) was built of the stone in 1907. In 1914, the first McBryde Hall introduced the Hokie Stone-clad Collegiate Gothic style, similar to great European universities. Originally designed as red brick building, McBryde Hall was clad in locally quarried stone because of a shortage of bricks due to military construction during World War I. The first stone dormitory, Main Campbell Hall, originally known as barracks No. 8 was built in 1930.http://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/campbell-hall.html Between the 1940s and the 1980s, a number concrete and brick structures absent of Hokie Stone such as Hillcrest Hall, Shultz Hall (now known as the Moss Arts Center), Cowgill Hall, Dietrick Hall, Litton Reaves Hall, Wallace Hall, Derring Hall (which ironically houses the geology department), the Cassell Coliseum and several residence halls on the Upper Quad were built. With the exception of Hillcrest Hall, which was built in the Gothic revival style in 1940 and clad in red brick, these were all modern structures and a radical departure from the architectural style of campus buildings built before World War II. In 1975 the Tech Foundation bought the quarry from the local Cupp family. In 2010, the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors made it official policy that Hokie Stone be the predominant material in the fa√ßade of every new building on the Blacksburg central campus.Board of Visitors Meeting minutes November 8, 2010. Virginia Tech Board of Visitors. p.4. Retrieved February 3, 2012 Today each campus project uses an average of 1,500 tons of Hokie Stone, with each ton of stone covering about 35 square feet. The use of the local stone may add as much as $1 million to the cost of a new building. Other uses In addition to building exteriors, Hokie Stone is used in important monuments such as biographical markers outside each campus building providing a brief history of the person for whom the building is named. Thirty-two Hokie Stones were quarried by university stonemasons and engraved with the names of students and professors killed in the April 2007 school shooting. The memorial is a permanent version of one students spontaneously created using smaller stones. The Virginia Tech football team enters the playing field at Lane Stadium through a tunnel with an exit topped by a block of Hokie Stone which is touched by each player. In 2011, Virginia Tech offered Hokie Stone as an option for the centerpiece of class rings. On September 26, 2013, the football team wore helmets decorated in a Hokie Stone motif for their game at Georgia Tech.

He is a former world record-holder in two relay events. Hall is well known for his \\"pro-wrestling like\\" antics before a competition; frequently strutting onto the pool deck in boxing shorts and robe, shadow boxing and flexing for the audience. Family His father, Gary Hall Sr., also competed in three Olympics as a swimmer (1968, 1972, and 1976). His maternal uncle, Charles Keating III, swam in the 1976 Olympics, and his maternal grandfather, Charles Keating Jr., was a national swimming champion in the 1940s. Career =1996 Atlanta games= In his first Olympics at the age of 21 in Atlanta, Hall had only 6 years of swimming experience yet he already had a well-known rivalry with Russia's Alexander Popov. Hall and his teammates dominated the relay events, but Popov beat Hall and dominated in the individual events. Hall won two individual silvers and two team relay golds at the games, including helping set the world record in both the 400 m freestyle and medley relays. =1996‚Äì2000= In 1998, Hall was suspended by International Swimming Federation (FINA) for marijuana use. In 1999, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, commonly referred to as childhood or juvenile diabetes. Upon his diagnosis, Hall struggled with the possibilities and the effects he knew the medical condition would have on his life. He took a short hiatus from swimming, but returned to compete in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. There he won the 50 m freestyle and placed second in the 100 m freestyle. His 50 m time of 21.76 seconds set a new American record, beating the ten-year-old record set by Tom Jager. =2000 Sydney games= Hall's success continued in the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney, Australia. He won the gold medal in the individual 50 m freestyle, tying with his fellow U.S. Team member Anthony Ervin, and won the gold and silver in the team relays. He also won a bronze in the individual 100-meter freestyle race. Prior to the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: \\"My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia's 4 √ó 100 m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won't be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time.\\" Hall swam the last leg in the relay, against Australian Ian Thorpe. Hall had a better start and came up a half body-length in front of Thorpe. Hall led the first length and was 0.23 seconds ahead at the turn but Thorpe fought back, and with 15 meters to go both swimmers were even; Thorpe finished first by a hand-length, inflicting the United States' first-ever Olympic defeat in the event.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PgUS2bglyI The Australian team responded to Hall's remarks after the race by playing air guitar on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, \\"I don't even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I've ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.\\" Another member of Australia's victorious 4 √ó 100 team, Michael Klim, recalled that \\"Hall was the first swimmer to come over and congratulate us. Even though he dished it out, he was a true sportsman.\\" The decisive moment in the relay race had been Klim's opening leg where he set a new 100-meter world record of 48.18, gaining a 0.71-second advantage over Anthony Ervin, a lead which his Australian teammates successfully defended. Hall clocked a faster 100 meters than Thorpe (48.24 to 48.30), but got out-touched to the wall by Thorpe (who earlier in the night set a new world record to win gold in the 400 meter freestyle). =2004 Athens games= At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Hall again won the gold medal in 50 m freestyle. At 29, he became the oldest American male Olympic swimmer since Duke Kahanamoku competed at age 34 in 1924. Despite having swum the fastest 50 in the year leading up to the 2004 Games, he was regarded as a long-shot to medal in the 50 m freestyle. He also won a bronze medal for competing in the preliminary heat of the 4 √ó 100-meter freestyle relay. =2008 Olympic trials= On July 5, 2008, Hall failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic team after finishing fourth in the 50-meter finals at the US Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska. The Race Club The Race Club is a swimming club founded by Hall and his father, Gary Hall Sr. The club, originally known as \\"The World Team,\\" was designed to serve as a training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman, Mark Foster, Ryk Neethling, Ricky Busquet and Therese Alshammar. They were coached by University of Michigan coach Mike Bottom. The Race Club offers various swimming camps, swim clinics, and swimming technique video recording year round for young swimmers at their Islamorada, Florida- based training center. Shark attack In the summer of 2006, Hall's sister, Bebe Hall, was attacked by a blacktip reef shark near Islamorada, while she and Gary were spearfishing, an attack for which Bebe Hall needed 19 stitches. Gary Hall repeatedly punched the shark and his sister shot a spear into it, after which the shark swam off. Personality Hall has long been one of competitive swimming's most colorful personalities. He often shadow-boxes before a race and is known for wearing a boxing robe in lieu of the usual warm-ups. The robe even earned Hall a fine during the 2004 Olympics, as the Everlast-made apparel broke the uniform supplying deal the team had with Speedo. His eccentricity has won him a great deal of fans, but what some perceive to be \\"showboating\\" has drawn substantial criticism. He is also an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drug use in swimming, and is one of the few prominent swimmers willing to publicly question the legitimacy of suspected individual accomplishments. In 2008, he compared International Swimming Hall of Fame inductee Amy Van Dyken to disgraced track & field athlete Marion Jones, noting they were both clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO).

Biography Musil was the oldest son born in 1868 into an poor farming family in Moravia (then Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today Czech Republic). His birthplace of Rycht√°≈ôov was in an area surrounded by German- speakers, allowing him and his brothers to learn to read and write both German and Czech. He was a second cousin of Robert Musil, an Austrian writer.Hall, M.G., \\"The great Austrian writer Robert Musil\\", Virtual Vienna [Digital Resource], Online: . In the years 1887‚Äì1891 he studied Roman Catholic theology at the University of Olomouc, was consecrated as a priest in 1891 and received a doctorate in theology in 1895. In the years 1895‚Äì1898 he studied at the Dominican Biblical School in Jerusalem, in 1897-1898 at the Jesuit University of St. Joseph in Beirut, 1899 in London, Cambridge and Berlin. Qusayr 'Amra in Jordan was discovered by Musil and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. He travelled extensively throughout the Arab world and kept coming back to it until 1917, collecting a huge body of scientific material. Among his discoveries was the 8th-century desert castle of Qusayr 'Amra, now famous for its figurative Islamic paintings. In the process of trying to steal the now-famed Umayyad fresco Painting of the Six Kings from Qusayr 'Amra, he permanently damaged the painting. He later developed a serious lung disease. Between his trips Musil continued working on his publications and lecturing. In 1902 he became professor of theology at the University of Olomouc, and in 1909, professor of Biblical studies and Arabic at Vienna University. In addition to modern and classical languages, he mastered 35 dialects of Arabic. He was so well acquainted with the Rwala Bedouins, that he was accepted into the tribe as \\"Sheikh Musa\\". During World War I he was sent to the Middle East to eliminate British attempts to instigate a revolution against the Ottoman Empire, thus being an opponent of T. E. Lawrence. In 1917 he journeyed through the Middle East with Archduke Hubert Salvator of Austria; there are suggestions that the mission had a political motive involving Arab Revolt against the Ottoman government. After the war he became a professor at Charles University in Prague (1920), despite opposing voices resenting his close ties with the House of Habsburg. He helped to establish the Oriental Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Prague.http://www.aloismusil.cz/index.php/alois- musil In cooperation with the American industrialist Charles Richard Crane he published his works in English (1922‚Äì23). In addition to scientific work and popular travel books he published 21 novels for young readers. Musil worked for Charles University until 1938, but was active until the very end of his life. He died in Otryby due to kidney dysfunction complicated by lung disease. Works Although Musil is best known for his discovery of Qusayr 'Amra, his output was prolific. He wrote more than 50 books (including six illustrated works published by the American Geographical Society and 20 children's books); some 1200 scholarly articles; transcriptions and translations of Bedouin tribal poems and songs; produced thousands of photographs of archaeological sites and Bedouin people and prepared topographic maps and surveys of territories.Harrigan, P., \\"From Moravia to Arabia\\", Aramco World [Magazine], November‚ÄìDecember, 2009, Online: * ·∏≤u·π£ejr  ªamra und andere Schl√∂sser √∂stlich von Moab: Topographischer Reisebericht, Wien 1902 * Sieben samaritanische Inschriften aus Damaskus, Wien 1903 * Od stvo≈ôen√≠ do potopy (From Creation to the Flood), Prag 1905 * Auf den Spuren der Geschichte des Alten Testaments, 2 Bde., Olm√ºtz 1906/07 * Kuseir 'Amra, 2 Bde., Wien 1907 * Arabia Petraea, 4 Bde., Wien 1907/08 * Ethnologischer Reisebericht, Wien 1908 * Im n√∂rdlichen Hegaz, Wien 1911 * Zur Zeitgeschichte von Arabien, Leipzig 1918Original publication of 1918 * The Northern Hegaz, a Topographical Itinerary, American Geographical Society, Oriental Studies and Explorations No: 1, 1926 * Northern Negd, New York 1928 * The Manners and Customs of the Rwala Bedouins, New York 1928 * In the Arabian Desert, arranged for publication by Katherine McGiffort, New York 1930 * Krest'ansk√© C√≠rkve dne≈°n√≠ho orienta (The Christian Churches in the present day Orient), Olm√ºtz 1939 * 1910 until 1933 over 1.500 articles, contributions to collected essays, and new paper articles, the most important ones are collected in: Dne≈°n√≠ Orient, 11 Bde., Prag 1934‚Äì1941.

Pulcinella is a stock character originating from commedia dell'arte. The ballet premiered at the Paris Opera on 15 May 1920 under the baton of Ernest Ansermet. The dancer L√©onide Massine created both the libretto and choreography, and Pablo Picasso designed the original costumes and sets. The ballet was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. A performance of the work typically lasts 35 minutes. The ballet score was revised by Stravinsky in 1965. History Diaghilev wanted a ballet based on an early eighteenth-century commedia dell'arte libretto and music then believed to have been composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. This attribution has since been proved to be spurious.Dunning 1988. Some of the music may have been written by Domenico Gallo, Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti. Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project, but the composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi. However, once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies. Pulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky's second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period.

They both danced in the performance, Robbins in the title role, They were joined in the premier by Francisco Moncion, who danced the role of The Devil.Francisco Moncion as The Devil in the premier of Balanchine's \\"Pulcinella\\" \\"Pulcinella\\" - Francisco Moncion, The George Balanchine Foundation  Story  Pulcinella is taken from a manuscript from Naples, dating from 1700, containing a number of comedies portraying the traditional character of the popular Neapolitan stage. This libretto was derived from Quatre Polichinelles semblables (\\"Four identical Pulcinellas\\"). The one-act ballet features Pulcinella, his girlfriend Pimpinella, his friends Furbo, Prudenza and Rosetta, and Florindo and Cloviello. The story starts with Florindo and Cloviello serenading Prudenza and Rosetta. The two women are unimpressed and reply by showering the suitors with water. Prudenza's father, a doctor, appears and chases them away. A new episode begins with Rosetta, when her father appears. Rosetta dances for Pulcinella and they kiss. But Pimpinella sees this and interrupts them. Florindo and Cloviello arrive and, jealous of Pulcinella, they beat him up. Pulcinella is stabbed, but this is a set-up event to gain Pimpinella's forgiveness of him. Furbo, disguised as a magician, comes and appears to resurrect Pulcinella in front of everybody. Pimpinella forgives Pulcinella, and Prudenza and Rosetta succumb to Florindo's and Cloviello's wooing. The ballet ends with the marriages of the three couples.  Music  The music is based on pieces then believed to have been composed by Italian composer Pergolesi. See the History section for more about the musical sources. The following is a description of the musical forces and movements. = Instrumentation = Pulcinella is scored for a modern chamber orchestra with three solo singers: ;Voices: :Solo soprano :Solo tenor :Solo bass ;Woodwinds: :2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo) :2 oboes :2 bassoons ;Brass: :2 horns in F :1 trumpet in C :1 trombone ;Strings: :Concertino: ::2 violins ::1 viola ::1 cello ::1 contrabass :Ripieno: ::8 violins ::4 violas ::3 celli ::3 contrabasses = Form = The ballet is in one act and is divided into 21 sections: # Overture: Allegro moderato # Serenata: Larghetto: \\"Mentre l'erbetta pasce l'agnella\\" (tenor) # Scherzino: Allegro # Poco pi√π vivo # Allegro # Andantino # Allegro # Ancora poco meno: \\"Contento forse vivere\\" (soprano) # Allegro assai # Allegro ‚Äì Alla breve: \\"Con queste paroline\\" (bass) # Andante: \\"Sento dire no' nc√® pace\\" (soprano, tenor and bass) # Allegro: \\"Chi disse c√† la femmena\\" (tenor) # Presto: \\"Nc√® sta quaccuna p√≤\\" (soprano and tenor) / \\"Una te fa la nzemprece\\" (tenor) # Allegro ‚Äì Alla breve # Tarantella # Andantino: \\"Se tu m'ami\\" (soprano) # Allegro # Gavotta con due variazioni # Vivo # Tempo di minuetto: \\"Pupillette, fiammette d'amore\\" (soprano, tenor and bass) # Finale: Allegro assai  Pieces based on Pulcinella  =Pulcinella Suite= The Pulcinella Suite, derived from the ballet, was written in 1922 and has no vocal parts.

He has coached crews to medals at every Olympics since 1972 with the exception of the 1984 Games, which were boycotted by Eastern Bloc countries.  Coaching career  Having studied sports science at Leipzig University, he returned to his local rowing club in Magdeburg and first attracted attention by coaching Wolfgang G√ºldenpfennig to the bronze medal in the 1972 Olympics. He then moved on to coach both the quadruple scull and coxless pairs who won gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The coxless pair of Bernd and J√∂rg Landvoigt also went on to triumph at the 1980 Summer Olympics under Gr√∂bler's guidance. From 1980 to 1990 he was chief coach of the East German women's rowing team. When Germany was reunited and the East German national sports administration collapsed in 1991, Gr√∂bler moved to Britain where he was employed by Leander Club and the Amateur Rowing Association. Controversy surrounded the appointment, given the suspicions that drug use had been rife in East German sports and that any senior coach would have been involved or had knowledge of the drugs programme. In an interview in 1998 he admitted that he had \\"difficulties\\" with the thought that drug taking may have caused medical problems for rowers, and that he had given \\"snippets\\" of information to the Stasi, the East German security organisation. Steve Redgrave defended him, blaming the East German system for the drug use, rather than Gr√∂bler personally, in keeping with Gr√∂bler's own statement that \\"I have to live with what went on in East Germany. I was born in the wrong place. It was not possible to walk away.\\" For Great Britain he achieved Olympic golds with: *Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996 in the pair *James Cracknell, Tim Foster, Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 2000 in the four *Steve Williams, James Cracknell, Ed Coode and Matthew Pinsent in 2004 in the four, *Tom James, Steve Williams, Pete Reed, and Andrew Triggs Hodge in 2008 in the four, *Alex Gregory, Pete Reed, Tom James and Andrew Triggs Hodge in 2012 in the four, and *Alex Gregory, Moe Sbihi, George Nash and Constantine Louloudis in 2016 in the four *Phelan Hill, Will Satch, Matt Langridge, Paul Bennett, Pete Reed, Matt Gotrel, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Tom Ransley and Scott Durant in 2016 in the eight. In August 2000, the month prior to coaching the coxless four to gold in Sydney, he took part in a 3-part BBC documentary entitled Gold Fever. This followed him and the crew in the years leading up to the Olympics, showing the hard work and tough decisions he faced in the quest for gold. In 2000 he won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award, and in March 2006 he was presented an honorary Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell for his contribution to British sport. In August 2020, it was announced that Grobler was retiring as Chief Coach for British Rowing with immediate effect.  Personal life  Gr√∂bler lives in Henley-on-Thames with his wife Angela.

He was the first Rwandan king to be baptised, and Roman Catholicism took hold in Rwanda during his reign. His Christian names were Charles L√©on Pierre, and he is sometimes referred to as Charles Mutara III Rudahigwa.  Early life and education  Rudahigwa was born in March 1911, in the royal capital of Rwanda, Nyanza, to King Yuhi V Musinga, and Queen Kankazi (later Queen Mother Radegonde Nyiramavugo III Kankazi), the first of his eleven wives. He was a member of the Tutsi Abanyiginya clan. In 1919 he began his education at the Colonial School for Chiefs' Sons in Nyanza, subsequently becoming his father's secretary in 1924. In January 1929 he was appointed a chief and administered a province.  Reign  Rudahigwa became king on 16 November 1931, the Belgian colonial administration having deposed his father, Yuhi V Musinga, four days earlier. He took the royal name Mutara, becoming Mutara III Rudahigwa. He is sometimes referred to as Charles Mutara III Rudahigwa. He was the first Rwandan king to convert to Catholicism, converting in 1943 and taking the Christian name Charles L√©on Pierre. His father had refused to convert to Christianity, and the Rwandan Catholic Church eventually perceived him as anti-Christian and as an impediment to their civilising mission. Rudahigwa had been secretly instructed in Christianity by L√©on Classe, the head of the Rwandan Catholic Church, since 1929, and was groomed by the Belgians to replace his father. In 1946 he dedicated the country to Christ, effectively making Christianity a state religion. His conversion spearheaded a wave of baptisms in the protectorate. His reign coincided with the worst recorded period of famine in Rwanda between 1941 and 1945, which included the Ruzagayura famine (1944 - 1945), during which time 200,000 out of the nation's population of around two million perished. = Rising ethnic tensions = During Rudahigwa's reign there was a marked stratification of ethnic identity within Ruanda-Urundi, the Belgian-ruled mandate of which Rwanda formed the northern part. In 1935, the Belgian administration issued identity cards formalising the ethnic categories, Tutsi, Hutu and Twa. After World War II, a Hutu emancipation movement began to grow throughout Ruanda-Urundi, fueled by increasing resentment of the inter-war social reforms, and also an increasing sympathy for the Hutu within the Catholic Church. Although in 1954, Rudhahigwa abolished the ubuhake system of indentured service that exploited Hutus, this had little real practical effect. The monarchy and prominent Tutsi sensed the growing influence of the Hutu and began to agitate for immediate independence on their own terms, culminating in Rudahigwa's demand for independence from Belgium in 1956. In 1957, a group of Hutu scholars wrote the \\"Bahutu Manifesto\\". This political manifesto denounced the \\"exploitation\\" of the Hutus by the ethnic Tutsi and called for their liberation from first Tutsi, and then Belgian, rule. Hutu political parties quickly formed after that, with future- president Gregoire Kayibanda forming the Hutu Social Movement (soon renamed MDR-PARMEHUTU), and Joseph Gitera creating Association for Social Promotion of the Masses (APROSOMA). = Death = On 24 July 1959, Rudahigwa arrived in Usumbura (now Bujumbura), Urundi, for a meeting with Belgian colonial authorities arranged by Father Andr√© Perraudin.Helen Codere 1973:293 The following day, he visited his Belgian doctor at the colonial hospital, where he died. The Belgian authorities put out conflicting explanations for his death. One was that he complained of a severe headache and had been treated by his doctor, but collapsed as he left the hospital of what was later determined, by three doctors, to be a cerebral haemorrhage. Another Belgian explanation was that he died from a reaction to a penicillin shot. An autopsy was not carried out due to the objections of Queen Mother Kankazi. Rumours that he had been deliberately killed by the Belgian authorities were rife, and tensions rose: ordinary Rwandans gathered along routes and stoned Europeans' cars. Rumours that he was in poor health, suffering from the effects of excessive drinking, as well as the effects of untreated syphilis, are claims unverified by any evidence. A Twa attendant of the king said he was in great health at the time,Codere 1973: 293 which is supported by his active engagement in sporting activities then, including vigorous games of tennis. Rudahigwa was succeeded by Jean-Baptiste Ndahindurwa, as Kigeli V.  Personal life  Mutara married Nyiramakomali on 15 October 1933 and they divorced in 1941. He married Rosalie Gicanda, a Christian, in a church wedding on 13 January 1942. After Rudahigwa's death, Rosalie Gicanda remained in Rwanda. She was murdered in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide on the orders of Idelphonse Nizeyimana. He was later detained, convicted by a UN war crimes court, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The word horilka may also be used in a generic sense in the Ukrainian language to mean vodka or other strong spirits and etymologically is similar to the Ukrainian word for burning - hority. Home-distilled horilka, moonshine, is called samohon (, literally 'self-distillate' or 'self-run' - almost identical to the Russian and ). Horilka is usually distilled from grain (usually wheat or rye), though it can, exceptionally, also be distilled from potatoes, honey, sugar beets etc. One type of horilka, called pertsivka (), is horilka with chili peppers. Historically, outside Ukraine, pertsivka is generally referred to when people speak of horilka, although pertsivka itself is just one type of horilka. It is believed that horilka was not as strong as today with about 20 percent alcohol by volume (40 proof). However, today nearly all industrially produced horilka is 40 percent (80 proof).  Derivatives  Ukrainian tradition has also produced various derivatives of horilka. Some of these are available as commercial products, but most are typically home-made. This includes various kinds of fruit infusion, nalyvka and spiced spotykach: malynivka made with raspberries, tertukha (strawberries), agrusivka (gooseberries), ternivka (blackthorn berries), kalynivka (snowball tree), shypshynnyk (rose hips), horobynivka (ashberries), zubrivka (bison grass), vyshnyak or vyshnivka from cherries, slyv‚Äùyanka (plums), morelivka (apricots), tsytrynivka (lemons), mokrukha (oranges and cloves), mochena (citrus rind), kontabas (blackcurrant buds). Horikhivka is flavoured with nuts. Horilka is also made with honey (called Medova), mint, or even milk. In some cases whole fruits of red peppers (capsicum) are put into the bottle, turning horilka into a sort of bitters; it is then named horilka z pertsem, or pertsivka. (One should be mindful of the usage: horilka z pertsem refers to horilka bottled with hot chilli peppers, whereas pertsivka typically refers to horilka spiced with the essence of pepper. Horilka z pertsem always refers to a Ukrainian spirit, whereas Pertsivka or Pertsovka may refer to Russian vodka.) Medova z pertsem is the combination of horilka with chili peppers and honey. Most of these preparations are aged with fruit for several weeks or months, then strained or decanted. Some recipes call for the jars to be placed on the rooftop, for maximum bleaching by the sun. Many include the addition of home-made syrup for a strong liqueur, others yield very dry, clear spirit. Some involve the fermentation of fruit as well as addition of horilka. Preparations which are baked in an oven, in a pot sealed with bread dough, are called zapikanka, varenukha or palynka. Traditions Horilka plays a role in traditional weddings in Ukraine. > And bring us a lot of horilka, but not of that fancy kind with raisins, or > with any other such things ‚Äî bring us horilka of the purest kind, give us > that demon drink that makes us merry, playful and wild! ‚ÄîTaras Bulba, by > Nikolai Gogol  Etymology  The word horilka is attested in 1562 (–≥–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∫–∞) and 1678 (–≥–æ—Ä—£–ª–∫–∞). Dialectic variants are harilka, horilash, horilytsya, horilets‚Äô, horilukha, z¬∑horivka, zorivka, orilka, as well as Western Ukrainian horivka, horychka. The word comes from the same root as the verb hority, ‚Äòto burn‚Äô, similarly to Belarusian harelka, south Russian gorelka, Czech ko≈ôalka, and Slovak goralka, gor≈æolka. It is considered to have come about following the Polish example gorza≈Çka, possibly as an abbreviation of a compound word like horile vyno (‚Äòburning wine‚Äô; compare the older word horƒõloe vyno, –≥–æ—Ä—£–ª–æ–µ –≤–∏–Ω–æ, attested in 1511) or horila(ya) voda (‚Äòburning water‚Äô; compare early Czech p√°len√° voda ‚Üí p√°lenka or Hungarian/Transylvanian palinka). It may be an adaptation of the early Old High German der brannte Wein ‚Üí Branntwein.Melnychuk, O.S. et al.

Pertsivka A pertsivka or horilka z pertsem () is the most widely associated type of horilka outside of Ukraine. It is made with whole fruits of capsicum put into the bottle, turning horilka into a sort of bitters. Sometimes perstsivka can be made also using honey, which is then called pertsivka z medom or medova z pertsem (honey-pepper flavoured horilka). Nemiroff is a Ukrainian brand actively promoting pepper horilka worldwide through the heavy use of product placement in cinema. The brand and company don't have long traditions but pertsivka production itself does. Production of Horilka Pereiaslav- Khmelnytskyi Horilka that is bottled and sold by companies is usually distilled from wheat or rye. Horilka may also contain honey or be distilled from honey, or contain chili peppers, mint or birch bud.Example of horilka made from grain: \\"Soft\\" horilka advertisement. \\"standard horilka distilled from grain and \\"soft\\" mineral water, from the Olimp website\\" The self- distilled alcoholic beverage is called samohon (literally \\"self-run\\", \\"self- steered\\") and is the homemade variety of horilka, akin to moonshine.

When he was eleven years of age Mustafa was circumcised. On January 18, 1863 Prince Mustafa became the heir apparent to his brother Isma'il Pasha but on May 28, 1866 the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlaziz changed the law so that the succession became by a direct male line of the reigning Khedive (viceroy) instead of passing from brother to brother. In protest of this decision, Mustafa Fazl Pasha left Egypt for Paris, where he patronized the Young Ottomans opposition against the Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. After losing his place as first in the line of succession Prince Mustafa was appointed minister for education in 1862, minister for finance in 1864 and 1869, and for minister for justice from 1871 until 1872.

Biography The son of the Qajar ruler Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, Mozaffar al-Din was named crown prince and sent as governor to the northern province of Azerbaijan in 1861. He spent his 35 years as crown prince in the pursuit of pleasure; his relations with his father were frequently strained, and he was not consulted in important matters of state.

At Mozaffar al- Din's accession Persia faced a financial crisis, with annual governmental expenditures far in excess of revenues due to the policies of his father. During his reign, Mozzafar ad-Din attempted some reforms of the central treasury; however, the previous debt incurred by the Qajar court, owed to both England and Russia, significantly undermined this effort. He furthered this debt by borrowing even more funds from Britain, France, and Russia. The income from these later loans was used to pay earlier loans rather than create new economic developments. In 1908, oil was discovered in Persia but Mozzaffar ad- Din had already awarded William Knox D'Arcy, a British subject, the rights to oil in most of the country in 1901.

During these periods, on the encouragements of his chancellor Amin-os-Soltan, he borrowed money from Nicholas II of Russia to pay for his extravagant traveling expenses. During his first visit he was introduced to the \\"cinematographe\\" in Paris, France. Immediately falling in love with the silver screen the Shah ordered his personal photographer to acquire all the equipment and knowledge needed to bring the moving picture to Persia, thus starting Persian cinema.Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution at www.horschamp.qc.ca The following is a translated excerpt from the Shah's diary: Portrait of Shah Muzaffer-Ed-Din, 1903. Additionally, in order to manage the costs of the state and his extravagant personal lifestyle Mozzafar ad-din Shah decided to sign many concessions, providing foreigners with monopolistic control of various Persian industries and markets. One example being the D'Arcy Oil Concession. Widespread fears amongst the aristocracy, educated elites, and religious leaders about the concessions and foreign control resulted in some protests in 1906. These resulted in the Shah accepting a suggestion to create a Majles (National Consultative Assembly) in October 1906, by which the monarch's power was curtailed as he granted a constitution and parliament to the people. He died of a heart attack 40 days after granting this constitution and was buried in Imam Husayn Shrine in Kerbala.

The Shah visited the United Kingdom in August 1902 with the anticipation of also receiving the Order of the Garter as it had been previously given to his father, Nasser-ed-Din Shah. King Edward VII refused to give this high honor to a non-Christian. Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary, had designs drawn up for a new version of the Order, without the Cross of St. George. The King was so enraged by the sight of the design, though, that he threw it out of his yacht's porthole. However, in 1903, the King had to back down and the Shah was appointed a member of the Order.Philip Magnus, King Edward the Seventh (London: John Murray, 1964) pages 301‚Äì5.

In general, the glass changes from transparent to translucent and vice versa, changing from letting light pass through to blocking some (or all) wavelengths of light and vice versa. Smart glass technologies include electrochromic, photochromic, thermochromic, suspended-particle, micro-blind, and polymer-dispersed liquid- crystal devices. When installed in the envelope of buildings, smart glass creates climate adaptive building shells.  Electrically switchable smart glass  = Suspended-particle devices = In suspended-particle devices (SPDs), a thin film laminate of rod-like nano-scale particles is suspended in a liquid and placed between two pieces of glass or plastic, or attached to one layer. When no voltage is applied, the suspended particles are randomly organized, thus blocking and absorbing light. When voltage is applied, the suspended particles align and let light pass. Varying the voltage of the film varies the orientation of the suspended particles, thereby regulating the tint of the glazing and the amount of light transmitted. SPDs can be manually or automatically \\"tuned\\" to precisely control the amount of light, glare and heat passing through. =Electrochromic devices= Electrochromic devices change light transmission properties in response to voltage and thus allow control over the amount of light and heat passing through. In electrochromic windows, the electrochromic material changes its opacity. A burst of electricity is required for changing its opacity, but once the change has been effected, no electricity is needed for maintaining the particular shade which has been reached. First generation electrochromic technologies tend to have a yellow cast in their clear states and blue hues in their tinted states. Darkening occurs from the edges, moving inward, and is a slow process, ranging from many seconds to several minutes (20‚Äì30 minutes) depending on window size. Newer electrochromic technologies eliminate the yellow cast in the clear state and tinting to more neutral shades of gray, tinting evenly rather than from the outside in, and accelerate the tinting speeds to less than three minutes, regardless of the size of the glass. Electrochromic glass provides visibility even in the darkened state and thus preserves visible contact with the outside environment. Recent advances in electrochromic materials pertaining to transition-metal hydride electrochromics have led to the development of reflective hydrides, which become reflective rather than absorbing, and thus switch states between transparent and mirror-like. Recent advancements in modified porous nano-crystalline films have enabled the creation of electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed on top of each other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as ITO or PEDOT:PSS). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor such as Titanium Dioxide, with adsorbed chromogens. These chromogens change color by reduction or oxidation. A passivator is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and separating the working electrode electrically from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalances the charge inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain overall device charge neutrality). Carbon is an example of charge reservoir film. A conducting carbon layer is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, typically 30 micrometer, or about 1/3 of a human hair. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive carbon layer. This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens. =Polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal devices= In polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal devices (PDLCs), liquid crystals are dissolved or dispersed into a liquid polymer followed by solidification or curing of the polymer. During the change of the polymer from a liquid to solid, the liquid crystals become incompatible with the solid polymer and form droplets throughout the solid polymer. The curing conditions affect the size of the droplets that in turn affect the final operating properties of the \\"smart window\\". Typically, the liquid mix of polymer and liquid crystals is placed between two layers of glass or plastic that include a thin layer of a transparent, conductive material followed by curing of the polymer, thereby forming the basic sandwich structure of the smart window. This structure is in effect a capacitor. Electrodes from a power supply are attached to the transparent electrodes. With no applied voltage, the liquid crystals are randomly arranged in the droplets, resulting in scattering of light as it passes through the smart window assembly. This results in the translucent, \\"milky white\\" appearance. When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, the electric field formed between the two transparent electrodes on the glass causes the liquid crystals to align, allowing light to pass through the droplets with very little scattering and resulting in a transparent state. The degree of transparency can be controlled by the applied voltage. This is possible because at lower voltages, only a few of the liquid crystals align completely in the electric field, so only a small portion of the light passes through while most of the light is scattered. As the voltage is increased, fewer liquid crystals remain out of alignment, resulting in less light being scattered. It is also possible to control the amount of light and heat passing through, when tints and special inner layers are used. = Micro- blinds = Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image of Micro-blinds Micro- blinds control the amount of light passing through in response to applied voltage. The micro-blinds are composed of rolled thin metal blinds on glass. They are very small and thus practically invisible to the eye. The metal layer is deposited by magnetron sputtering and patterned by laser or lithography process. The glass substrate includes a thin layer of a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer. A thin insulator is deposited between the rolled metal layer and the TCO layer for electrical disconnection. With no applied voltage, the micro-blinds are rolled and let light pass through. When there is a potential difference between the rolled metal layer and the transparent conductive layer, the electric field formed between the two electrodes causes the rolled micro-blinds to stretch out and thus block light. The micro-blinds have several advantages including switching speed (milliseconds), UV durability, customized appearance and transmission. The micro-blinds is developed at the National Research Council (Canada).Micro-blinds for smart glass Related areas of technology The expression smart glass can be interpreted in a wider sense to include also glazings that change light transmission properties in response to an environmental signal such as light or temperature. * Different types of glazing can show a variety of chromic phenomena, that is, based on photochemical effects the glazing changes its light transmission properties in response to an environmental signal such as light (photochromism), temperature (thermochromism), or voltage (electrochromism). * Liquid crystals, when they are in a thermotropic state, can change light transmission properties in response to temperature. * Various metals have been investigated. Thin Mg-Ni films have low visible transmittance and are reflective. When they are exposed to H2 gas or reduced by an alkaline electrolyte, they become transparent. This transition is attributed to the formation of magnesium nickel hydride, Mg2NiH4. Films were created by cosputtering from separate targets of Ni and Mg to facilitate variations in composition. Single-target d.c. magnetron sputtering could be used eventually which would be relatively simple compared to deposition of electrochromic oxides, making them more affordable. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory determined that new transition metals were cheaper and less reactive, but contained the same qualities, thus further reducing the cost. * Tungsten-doped Vanadium dioxide VO2 coating reflects infrared light when the temperature rises over , to block out sunlight transmission through windows at high ambient temperatures. These types of glazings cannot be controlled manually. In contrast, all electrically switched smart windows can be made to automatically adapt their light transmission properties in response to temperature or brightness by integration with a thermometer or photosensor, respectively. Examples of use ICE 3 train with view into driver's cab ICE 3 train with glass panel switched to \\"frosted\\" mode Eureka Tower in Melbourne has a glass cube which projects out from the building with visitors inside, suspended almost above the ground. When one enters, the glass is opaque as the cube moves out over the edge of the building. Once fully extended over the edge, the glass becomes clear. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner features electrochromic windows which replaced the pull down window shades on existing aircraft. NASA is looking into using electrochromics to manage the thermal environment experienced by the newly developed Orion and Altair space vehicles. Smart glass has been used in some small-production cars including the Ferrari 575 M Superamerica. ICE 3 high speed trains use electrochromatic glass panels between the passenger compartment and the driver's cabin. The elevators in the Washington Monument use smart glass in order for passengers to view the commemorative stones inside the monument. The city's restroom in Amsterdam's Museumplein square features smart glass for ease of determining the occupancy status of an empty stall when the door is shut, and then for privacy when occupied. Bombardier Transportation has intelligent on-blur windows in the Bombardier Innovia APM 100 operating on Singapore's Bukit Panjang LRT line, to prevent passengers from peering into apartments while the train is moving and is planning to offer windows using smart glass technology in its Flexity 2 light rail vehicles. Chinese phone manufacturer OnePlus demonstrated a phone whose rear cameras are placed behind a pane of electrochromic glass. Public toilets in Tokyo use this technology when the occupied restroom door is locked.  In popular culture  * The 1982 film Blade Runner contains an early depiction of smart glass in a scene in which a room is darkened with a smart-glass-like shade so Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, can administer a polygraph-style test to determine whether Rachael, portrayed by Sean Young, is an organic robot known as a replicant. * The 1993 film Philadelphia features a scene in which a large conference room in the middle of the law firm has walls of glass on three sides. Jason Robards says, \\"Bill, will you get the windows?\\", and a switch is thrown, and all the windows immediately become translucent, so that no one can see them firing Tom Hanks' character. * In the 1999 game Dino Crisis, there is a \\"bulletproof glass made of liquid crystal. You can't see through it because it is currently set to \\"smoke\\" mode\\" as the main protagonist Regina describes a panel of glass in the final area of the game. * Smart glass is seen in the 2002 motion picture The Sum of All Fears, in which Jack Ryan, played by Ben Affleck, is ushered into a secret room in the Pentagon, the windows of which whiten over as the door is shut. * Smart glass can be seen in the third season of the television series 24, where Jack Bauer changed the visibility to frosted glass to conceal the view as he was injecting heroin. * Smart glass is mentioned in season three, episode five of CSI: Miami, entitled \\"Legal\\", in which a young lady working undercover to expose underage drinking is murdered in a room shielded by what Ryan Wolfe refers to as \\"intelligent glass\\", where closing the door completes an electrical circuit, making the glass frost over and become opaque. The episode first aired in 2004. * Smart glass is seen in the television series Lie to Me with the interrogation/interview room at the Lightman Group offices consisting of what amounts to a room-sized box within a larger room, with smart glass walls. The walls appear to be white and opaque most of the time, but can be rendered clear to reveal those observing a subject from the outside. * Smart glass was featured in 2005 video game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory in a fifth mission, \\"Displace International\\", enabling the main character to quickly switch between on and off modes with his OCP pistol attachment. *Smart glass was shown in the movie Iron Man (2008), after the reporter Christine Everhart wakes up after a one- night stand with Tony Stark. * Smart glass is seen in use in White Collar season 1 episode 8 \\"Hard Sell\\" when Neal comes to tell Daniel Reed that Avery plans to betray him. Daniel flips a switch and his office window becomes frosted over, preventing Avery from peeking inside while they talk. * Smart glass was featured in the 2012 James Bond movie Skyfall, revealing Raoul Silva to M after he is captured. * Smart glass was used in the bathroom in The Real World: Austin. * Dimmable smart glass was featured in the 2014 film, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, in the S.H.I.E.L.D. office in Washington, D.C. * Smart glass was featured in the 2014 animated feature Big Hero 6, used by Tadashi Hamada for his office. * In the fifth season of Angel, smart glass lines the interior wall of Angel's office, and can be frosted over at the flick of a switch under Angel's desk. (The fictional vampire-safe \\"necro- tempered glass\\" lines the outer walls of the building.) * Electrochromic glass can be seen in wide use at 2016 video game Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. EC glass is frequently used for blocking/unblocking vision between rooms and surrounding environment. *In the 2018 Korean drama What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, Lee Young-joon was hugging his secretary, Kim Mi-so, when suddenly, three of Mi-so's friends, Mr. Jung, Kim Ji-ah, and Ms. Bong, were watching them from Mr. Lee's window. Mi-so realized that they were being watched, so she grabbed a remote and activated the electrochomic glass to prevent them from seeing what was happening. *In the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V, certain building purchased by the player in the game's online mode can be upgraded with \\"privacy glass\\".

He was one of the main organizers of the 1913 Armory Show, which introduced European modernism to America. Born in Petersburg, Virginia and raised in Philadelphia, Trenton and Baltimore, he spent his adult life in New York City. Myers worked briefly as an actor and scene painter. He then studied art for a year at Cooper Union followed by study at the Art Students League over a period of eight years where his main teacher was George de Forest Brush. In 1896 he went to Paris, but only stayed a few months, believing that his main classroom was the streets of New York's Lower East Side. His strong interest and feelings for the new immigrants resulted in over a thousand drawings, as well as paintings, etchings and watercolors that depicted their lives outside of the tenements which were their first homes in America. In a 1923 magazine article he explained why cities were his greatest source of inspiration: > All my life I had lived, worked and played in the poorest streets of > American cities. I knew them and their population and was one of them. > Others saw ugliness and degradation there, I saw poetry and beauty, so I > came back to them. I took a sporting chance of saying something out of my > own experience and risking whether it was worthwhile or not. That is all any > artist can do. Life and career =Early years= Backyard 1888, oil on board Born in Petersburg, Virginia, Jerome Myers was one of Abram and Julia Hillman Myers' five children. His brother, Gustavus Myers, later became a prominent muckraking journalist, socialist activist, and historian. As their father was often absent, the Myers children were raised by their mother and eventually lived in Trenton, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From time to time, the siblings were placed in foster homes when their mother was ill. Given these family hardships, Myers began taking odd jobs at a young age, living in Baltimore, Maryland, before moving on to New York City. Arriving in Manhattan in 1886 at the age of nineteen, Myers worked for several years as a scene painter and later for the Moss Engraving Company, where he reproduced photographic negatives. During this time he began attending evening art classes at Cooper Union and the Art Students League. Even then, his interest in urban subjects was evident. Myers' earliest oil painting, Backyard (1888), depicting a clotheslines silhouetted against distant tenements, is today thought to be one of the first paintings exemplifying Ashcan School subject matter in America.Holcomb, Grant (May 1977). \\"The Forgotten Legacy of Jerome Myers (1867-1940) Painter of New York's Lower East Side\\". American Art Journal, Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 78-91. Retrieved via Jstor.org 25 July 2015 (subscription required). Similarly, around 1893, after sketching a canal boat during a day trip along the Morris and Essex Canal, Myers made his first sale to the woman who lived on the boat. The price was two dollars. =Becoming a professional artist= Market in Paris, 1920, oil on canvas In 1895, Myers found work in the art department of the New York Tribune. With savings of two hundred and fifty dollars from this job, he traveled to Paris in 1896. Upon his return to New York City, with only twenty dollars left, he rented, for seven dollars a month, a studio at 232 West 14th Street in a former five-story mansion, \\"equipped with a skylight and converted to the use of artists.\\"Myers, Jerome (1940). Artist in Manhattan, p. 25. New York: American Artists Group, Inc. There, his next door neighbor was Edward Adam Kramer, a painter just one year older than Myers himself. While Myers' art training had been limited to short stints at New York's Cooper Union and the Art Students League, Kramer had acquired his education in the European art centers of Munich, Berlin, and Paris. It was Kramer who ushered Myers into the world of the professional artist. One day, when the art dealer William Macbeth arrived at Kramer's studio to view work, Kramer directed him to Myers' studio as well. Macbeth purchased two small paintings of his early New York street scenes from Myers on the spot, and simultaneously recommended that he bring additional work to the gallery. Macbeth thought highly of these two paintings and, taking them to his gallery, soon sold one to the banker, James Speyer. As an early critic for the New York Globe stated: \\"Myers' reputation dates from that purchase.\\" Holcomb III, Grant (1970). The Life and Art of Jerome Myers (Masters' thesis). University of Delaware Macbeth also suggested that Myers relinquish drawing in pencil and pastel and turn to oils. In the years following 1902, Myers sold work through the Macbeth Gallery and exhibited in group shows at other venues. In March and April 1903, when the Colonial Club of New York held its annual art show, Exhibition of Paintings Mainly by New Men, among the twenty artists included were Robert Henri, John French Sloan, and Myers, showing their works together for the first time. =Summer in Manhattan= Night in Seward Park, 1919, oil on canvas For Jerome Myers, summer in Manhattan provided particular opportunities for depicting immigrant life in the urban landscape. The hot weather brought the tenement dwellers out into the streets and parks of the city. By July 1906, Myers' reputation as an artist depicting the life of the people on the Lower East Side was such that a New York Times reporter was assigned to him, beginning at five o'clock one morning, to observe the artist capturing likenesses of the adults at work and children at play. To walk through the East Side with Myers, the reporter noted, \\"turning off here and there to glance at some particular house or group of people, ... [was] to receive an impression of a joyous life lived in the open air for much the same reason as people live in that fashion in Europe‚Äîbecause their homes are not as comfortable as the streets.\\"\\"Life on the East Side his Art Inspiration,\\" New York Times, July 1, 1906. Individual responses to Myers' presence, however, were grounded in cultural differences. While the residents of Italian neighborhoods viewed the artist and his activities with excitement and curiosity, those of the Jewish Quarter, whose traditions often forbade the production of representational images, protested by moving away from the artist's range of vision. =Later years= Myers won the Altman Prize for Street Shrine in 1931 and again in 1937 for City Playground. He was awarded the National Academy's Carnegie Prize in 1936 and the Isidor Medal in 1938. In 1934 the Metropolitan Museum of Art had purchased the painting Street Group from the Municipal Art Exhibition in Rockefeller Center. The New York Herald Tribune reported: The Tambourine. This oil painting from 1905 was one the 90 works shown in the Jerome Myers Memorial Exhibition held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1941. > the painting by Mr. Myers is of a group of women standing talking in a > somber street, with children playing about them.

The June 1913 Metropolitan Museum Bulletin wrote: > Jerome Myers for several years has been showing New Yorkers the artistic > possibilities of what is perhaps the unique part of the city's scenes.

Carnegie Hall in 1899, showing the added towers where Myers had his studio Not only was the sale to the Metropolitan a great honor then, but it also provided him with enough money to move his family from their small studio into a more spacious one in the new Carnegie Hall. Over the years, despite moving around to various studios, he always came back to Carnegie as his real home. Myers died in his Carnegie studio on June 19, 1940 after a series of illnesses complicated by an injury sustained from a fall. He was 73.New York Times (20 July 1940). \\"Jerome Myers, 73, Noted Artist Dies\\", p. 23. Retrieved 24 July 2015 (subscription required for full access). Earlier that year, he had published his autobiography, Artist In Manhattan. In their obituary for Myers, published in July 1940, The Art Digest wrote: > Though Myers later achieved wide honors‚Äîhe was elected to the Academy and > awarded such important prizes as the Altman, the Carnegie and the Isidor > Medal‚Äîhe suffered from neglect in recent years.

In April‚ÄìMay 1941 the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City held the Jerome Myers Memorial Exhibition with over 90 of his paintings, drawings and etchings lent by museums throughout the United States as well as private collectors. The oil paintings exhibited ranged from his 1905 The Tambourine to a self-portrait completed in 1939, the year before his death.Wickey, Henry (1941). Jerome Myers Memorial Exhibition. Whitney Museum of American Art Myers was survived by his wife and fellow artist Ethel Myers whom he had married in 1905 and their daughter, the dancer Virginia Myers. Following her husband's death Ethel devoted much of her time to furthering his artistic reputation. She lectured on his work throughout the United States, under the auspices of the American Federation of Arts from 1941 to 1943 and maintained the Jerome Myers Memorial Gallery in New York City for a number of years.Columbus Museum.

Of this experience he wrote: He attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University, where he took a first in each part of the Natural Sciences tripos (1893 and 1895). He was Arnold Gerstenberg student in 1896 (this fund was set up in 1892 for the promotion of the study of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics among students of Natural SciencesUniversity of Cambridge(2007) Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge. Cambridge University Press , ), and received the degree Doctor in Medicine from Gonville and Caius in October 1901. He also trained at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. =Travels and study of ethnic music= In 1898 he joined W. H. R. Rivers and William McDougall on the Cambridge anthropological expedition organised by Alfred Cort Haddon to the Torres Straits and Sarawak. Here he studied ethnic music, carrying out research on rhythm in Borneo.Davies, J.B. (1978). The Psychology of Music. Stanford University Press. In 1906 he contributed an appendix entitled \\"Traces of African Melody in Jamaica\\" to the book Jamaican Song and Story by Walter Jekyll. =Early career= Between 1901 and 1902 Myers was involved in the collection of anthropometric measurements of Egyptians[library.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtl039771.pdf \\"Manuscripts Collection if the ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN & IRELAND, 50 Fitzroy Street, LONDON W1P 5HS\\" at wellcome.ac.uk] On his return to England he was appointed house physician at St Bartholomew's. In 1902 he returned to Cambridge to help Rivers teach the physiology of the special senses. In 1904 Myers married Edith Babette, youngest daughter of Isaac Seligman, a merchant in London; they had three daughters and two sons. Myers remained in Cambridge to become, in succession, demonstrator, lecturer, and, in 1921, reader in experimental psychology. From 1906 to 1909 he was also professor in experimental psychology at London University. In 1909, when W.H.R. Rivers resigned a part of his Lectureship, Myers became the first lecturer at Cambridge University whose whole duty was to teach experimental psychology. For this he received a stipend of ¬£50 a year. He held this position until 1930. Venn, J & J.A, Alumni Cantabrigienses From 1911 Myers co-edited the British Journal of Psychology with Rivers. In 1914 he took over as sole editor, continuing in this post until 1924. In 1912, Myers used his enthusiasm and ability to raise funds to establish the first English laboratory especially designed for experimental psychology at Cambridge. He became the laboratory's first Director and held this position until 1930. (The Cambridge Laboratory of Experimental Psychology).Cambridge Laboratory of Experimental Psychology Venn, J & V.A., Alumni Cantabrigienses ] =First World War= In 1915 Myers was given a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps and in 1916 he was appointed consultant psychologist to the British armies in France with a staff of assistants at Le Touquet. In 1915 Myers was the first to use the term \\"shell shock\\" in an article in The Lancet,Myers, C.S. (1915) \\"A contribution to the study of shell shock\\". Lancet, 1', pp.316‚Äì320 though he later acknowledged in 1940 that he did not invent the term.Myers, C.S. (1940) Shell shock in France 1914‚Äì1918, based on a war diary, Cambridge University Press He tried to save shell-shocked soldiers from execution. He became frustrated with opposition to his views during his time in the military,Jones, E. (2008) \\"The art of medicine: Doctors at war\\" , The Lancet, 371, 1658‚Äì1859. particularly the view that shell-shock was a treatable condition. His efforts have been called \\"a pioneering but frustrating struggle to get psychological evidence and applied psychology accepted\\" He was so upset by the rejection of his ideas by the military authorities that he refused to give evidence to the Southborough Committee on shell-shock because, as he wrote in 1940, \\"the recall of my past five years' work proved too painful for me.\\"MYERS, C. S. (1940) \\"Shell-Shock in France 1914‚Äì1918, Based on a War Diary kept by C. S. Myers\\", Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. In the last year of the war he devised tests and supervised their application for the selection of men suited to hydrophone work for detecting enemy submarines. =Postwar career= After the war, Myers returned to his Cambridge position. But here too he was deeply dissatisfied, wanting wider opportunities for the development of his more practical interests, and feeling that official and academic circles showed little genuine interest in psychology. From 1922 he did devote himself to the development of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) which he had founded with Henry John Welch in 1921. He was also involved in what became the Industrial Health Research Board. Later, when the advisory committee on personnel selection was set up by the War Office, he was appointed a member. He delivered the Bradshaw Lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in 1933 on \\"A Psychological Regard for Medical Education\\". He died at his home in Winsford, near Minehead, Somerset in 1946. The Charles Myers Library was set up by the National Institute of Industrial Psychology and is currently incorporated into the Wellcome Library. =Myers and the British Psychological Society= Myers was one of the ten founding members of The Psychological Society in 1901 which would later become the British Psychological Society in 1906. In January 1904, Myers became the first Secretary of the Society. In 1919 Myers suggested that membership should be opened up to \\"all those interested in various branches of psychology\\".Edgell, B. (2001). The British Psychological Society, British Journal of Psychology, 92, 3‚Äì22 (Original work published 1947) He was elected as the first president of the society, following its enlargement in 1920. He held this position between 1920 and 1923.Presidents ‚Äì BPS In 1920, Myers, represented the BPS on the board of management of a new journal, Discovery, which dealt with the recent advances in scientific knowledge. Dr Myers was also the Society's representative on the committee formed to consider a memorial to the late Dr W.H.R. Rivers. A fund was raised for the furtherance of the sciences to which Dr Rivers had been interested, in particularly anthropology and psychology.

He is known as the father of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, as its first chief signal officer just prior to the American Civil War, the inventor of wig-wag signaling (or aerial telegraphy), and also as the father of the U.S. Weather Bureau. Early life Myer was born in Newburgh, New York, son of Henry Beekman Myer and Eleanor McClanahan Myer.Texas Handbook The family moved to Western New York and after the death of his mother in 1834, he was raised primarily by his aunt in Buffalo. Myer worked as a telegrapher before entering Geneva College (now Hobart College) in Geneva, New York, in 1842, at age 13,Cameron, pp. 1380-81. and from where he was graduated in 1847 as a member of The Kappa Alpha Society.Tarleton, p. 106. He received his M.D. degree from Buffalo Medical College in 1851, while working part-time for the New York State Telegraph Company. His doctoral thesis, A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes, showed concepts that he later used for his invention of aerial telegraphy. He was ambitious and intellectually curious. It was said \\"that he was specially noted for the manner in which he would take hold of an idea or principle, and, following it to its length and breadth, develop all there was in it or of it.\\"Brown, p. 20. He inherited a large fortune from his family. He engaged in private medical practice in Florida and then sought a commission as a U.S. Army assistant surgeon (lieutenant), entering service September 18, 1854, posted at Fort Duncan, Texas, and Fort Davis, Jeff Davis County, Texas. His major interest of the time, besides medicine, was to devise a system of signaling across long distances, using simple codes and lightweight materials. This system of codes using a single signal flag (or a lantern or kerosene torch at night), known as wig-wag signaling or aerial telegraphy, would be adopted and used by both sides in the Civil War and afterward.Brown, pp. 20-21.Myer's signaling system should not be confused with semaphore signaling. The wig-wag system used a single flag, waved back and forth in a quasi-binary code conceptually similar to Morse code; semaphores used two flags and each character to be transmitted had a unique pattern for holding the flags. In 1858, the Army expressed interest in Myer's invention and appointed a board to examine \\"the principles and plans of the signalling, mode of use in the field, and course to be pursued in introducing to the army.\\" Myer appeared before the board, chaired by Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, in 1859 and convinced them to authorize field testing of his invention. He conducted field tests starting in April of that year around New York Harbor. The tests were successful and Secretary of War John B. Floyd recommended to Congress that the Army adopt Myer's system and that Myer be appointed as chief signal officer. Congress approved Myer's appointment as major and chief signal officer and the Signal Corps was formed, despite opposition in the Senate by Jefferson Davis from Mississippi. Myer was sent to the Department of New Mexico for further field trials of his system in a campaign against the Navajos. On August 24, 1857, he married Catherine Walden, daughter of a prominent Buffalo attorney, with whom he would have six children. Signal Corps and the Civil War Myer was awarded a brevet promotion for his duties at Malvern Hill and other battles. The June 21, 1860, letter from the War Department that ordered Myer to organize and command the new U.S. Army Signal Corps provided little of substance. It authorized $2000 for equipment and a promotion for Myer to major, effective June 27. Myer was faced with the responsibility of recruiting subordinates who could be detailed from elsewhere in the Army. The Signal Corps would not commence as an official Army organization until March 3, 1863, at which time Myer was promoted to colonel. Between these two dates, Myer served first under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler at Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he established a camp of instruction, and then as the chief signal officer for Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac in its campaigns from the Peninsula Campaign to the Battle of Antietam. During this period Myer was awarded a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his actions at Hanover Court House, and to brevet colonel for Malvern Hill.Eicher, pp. 402-03. Ironically, the first use in combat of Myer's signaling system was by Confederate Captain Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run. Alexander had been a subordinate of Myer's and assisted in the New York field trials.Brown, pp. 43-44. In addition to his aerial signaling, Myer recognized the need for electrical telegraphy in field communications. He introduced a field telegraph train of wagons to support a device called the Beardslee telegraph, which used a dial instead of a key tapping Morse code, developed to require less training for its operators. Myer's Signal Corps was actually a separate entity from the Military Telegraph Service, a War Department bureau staffed primarily by civilian telegraph operators. He had numerous organizational disputes with the assistant secretary of war for this function, attempting on several occasions to take control of all telegraphic operations. When he proposed to remove the less than dependable Beardslee device and recruit training telegraphers into the Signal Corps, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton removed him from his post as chief signal officer on November 15, 1863, and reassigned him out of Washington, D.C., effectively exiling him. While conducting routine reconnaissance of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to Memphis, Tennessee, Myer wrote the Manual of Signals for the United States Army and Navy. In June 1864, he was appointed by Maj. Gen. E.R.S. Canby to be the signal officer of the Military Division of West Mississippi. Under Canby, Myer added a new duty to the tasks of the Signal Corps by working out a system for interrogating deserters and refugees who came into the Union lines. He also developed a coding system for transmitting routine messages between land and sea forces. He organized communications plans for the operations in the Mobile area and participated, with U.S. Navy officers, in the surrender of Fort Gaines.Scheips, Civil War History article. He served as signal officer for the Department of the Gulf from August 1864 to 1865. While he was preparing for the Mobile campaign, Myer received the disturbing news that his appointment as colonel and chief signal officer, which had been made before his dismissal in 1863, had not been confirmed by the Senate and was revoked, thus returning him to his permanent rank of major. Through early 1865, Myer employed lawyers and political connections to attempt to correct what he perceived as an injustice. On July 28, 1866, reacting to the influence of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and President Andrew Johnson, Congress reorganized the Signal Corps and, with the permanent rank of colonel, Myer again became chief signal officer. He was particularly gratified when word of this victory came on October 30, 1866, as his old nemesis, Edwin Stanton, had to inform him of his reinstatement. He was not confirmed in the position until February 1867 and was not ordered to active duty until August 1867. His new duties included control of the telegraph service, resolving the dispute that had removed him from his position. On December 3, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Myer for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army (United States), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1868.Eicher, 2001, p. 736.Eicher shows the nomination date as December 3, 1867 and confirmation date as February 14, 1867, an apparent typographical error. Myer received the brevet grade in honor of his formation of the Signal Corps. His commission as brigadier general in the regular Army came on June 16, 1880, two months before his death. As an Army officer, Myer was nicknamed \\"Old Probabilities\\" by his subordinates. Postbellum career Myer's International Weather Chart (October 1877) The U.S. Congress, on February 9, 1870, authorized \\"... meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the states and territories of the United States, and for giving notice on the northern lakes and seaboard by telegraph and signals of the approach and force of storms\\". This duty, previously conducted by the Smithsonian Institution, was assigned to General Myer's Signal Corps, due in part to his previous interests in storm telegraphy. It was the birth of the U.S. Weather Bureau, now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.NOAA website . In 1873 at the International Meteorological Congress of Vienna, he proposed a resolution for the establishment throughout the world of weather stations and daily exchange of simultaneous weather observations,Report of the proceedings of the Meteorological congress at Vienna, 1873, p. 32. the effective beginning of the World Meteorological Organization.Origins of the WMO . Myer was instrumental in the development of heliography in the U.S. Army. In 1877, he acquired heliograph instruments from the British Army for experimental purposes and sent them on to General Nelson A. Miles, at the Yellowstone Department in Montana. Miles developed expertise with the heliograph, which he used to great purpose in the Arizona Apache campaigns.Coe, Lewis (1993) The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and its Predecessors in the United States McFarland, Jefferson, N.C., p. 10, Myer headed the Signal Corps from August 21, 1867, until his death of nephritis at Buffalo, New York, in 1880. He is interred in the Walden-Myer Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo. Legacy Portrait of Myer by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1876 Myer is honored by several entities: Fort Whipple, Virginia, was renamed Fort Myer in 1881; U.S. Army cable ship Albert J. Myer built in 1945 serving Army Signal Corps 1952-1966 then U.S. Navy service 1966-1994; the Albert J. Myer Center, the Signal Headquarters building of the U.S. Army Communication Electronics Command (CECOM) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey; and the General Albert J. Myer Forecast Facility at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Hobart College awarded Myer an honorary LL.D. degree in 1872 and Union College conferred an honorary Ph.D. on him in 1875.

Friedrich Myconius (originally named Friedrich Mekum and also Friedrich Mykonius) (26 December 1490 ‚Äì 7 April 1546) was a German Lutheran theologian and Protestant reformer. He was a colleague of Martin Luther. He was born in Lichtenfels, Bavaria. A friend and co-worker of Martin Luther, he preached Luther's message to the people of Leipzig and Gotha, where he founded the Gotha Gymnasium. He was sent to England to discuss the details of the Augsburg Confession, and later wrote a history of the reformation. In 1540 Myconius became sick and was expected to die within a short time. On his bed he wrote a loving farewell note to Luther with a trembling hand. Luther received the letter and sent back a reply: \\"I command thee in the name of God to live because I still have need of thee in the work of reforming the church.‚Ä¶ The Lord will never let me hear that thou art dead, but will permit thee to survive me. For this I am praying, this is my will, and may my will be done, because I seek only to glorify the name of God.\\" Although Myconius had already lost the ability to speak when Luther's letter came, he recovered completely and lived six more years to survive Luther himself by two months.

Chemically, they are a series of parahydroxybenzoates or esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid (also known as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid). Parabens are effective preservatives in many types of formulas. These compounds, and their salts, are used primarily for their bactericidal and fungicidal properties. They are found in shampoos, commercial moisturizers, shaving gels, personal lubricants, topical/parenteral pharmaceuticals, suntan products, makeup, and toothpaste. They are also used as food preservatives. No effective direct links between parabens and cancer have been established. Mode of action Parabens are active against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. However, their antibacterial mode of action is not well understood. They are thought to act by disrupting membrane transport processes or by inhibiting synthesis of DNA and RNA or of some key enzymes, such as ATPases and phosphotransferases, in some bacterial species. Propylparaben is considered more active against more bacteria than methylparaben. The stronger antibacterial action of propylparaben may be due to its greater solubility in the bacterial membrane, which may allow it to reach cytoplasmic targets in greater concentrations. However, since a majority of the studies on the mechanism of action of parabens suggest that their antibacterial action is linked to the membrane, it is possible that its greater lipid solubility disrupts the lipid bilayer, thereby interfering with bacterial membrane transport processes and perhaps causing the leakage of intracellular constituents. Chemistry Parabens are esters of para- hydroxybenzoic acid, from which the name is derived. Common parabens include methylparaben (E number E218), ethylparaben (E214), propylparaben (E216), butylparaben and heptylparaben (E209). Less common parabens include isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, benzylparaben and their sodium salts. The general chemical structure of a paraben is shown at the top right of this page, where R symbolizes an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. Synthesis All commercially used parabens are synthetically produced, although some are identical to those found in nature. They are produced by the esterification of para-hydroxybenzoic acid with the appropriate alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, or n-propanol. para- Hydroxybenzoic acid is in turn produced industrially from a modification of the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, using potassium phenoxide and carbon dioxide.  Health considerations  Most of the available paraben toxicity data are from single-exposure studies, meaning one type of paraben in one type of product. According to paraben research this is relatively safe, posing only a negligible risk to the endocrine system. However, since many types of parabens in many types of products are used commonly, further assessment of the additive and cumulative risk of multiple paraben exposure from daily use of multiple cosmetic and/or personal care products is needed. FDA states that they have no information that use of parabens in cosmetics has any effect on health. They continue to consider certain questions and evaluate data about parabens' possible health effects. =Allergic reactions= Parabens are, for the most part, non-irritating and non-sensitizing. Among people with contact dermatitis or eczema, less than 3% of patients were found to have a sensitivity to parabens. At least one case has been reported of an allergic reaction to parabens. =Breast cancer= The American Cancer Society mentioned a 2004 study that found parabens in the breast tissue of mastectomy patients but did not find parabens to be a cause of the cancers. Michael Thun of ACS stated that the effects of parabens would be minuscule compared to other risks \\"such as taking hormones after menopause and being overweight\\".The American Cancer Society Antiperspirants and Breast Cancer Risk A 2005 review concluded \\"it is biologically implausible that parabens could increase the risk of any estrogen-mediated endpoint, including effects on the male reproductive tract or breast cancer\\" and that \\"worst-case daily exposure to parabens would present substantially less risk relative to exposure to naturally occurring endocrine active chemicals in the diet such as the phytoestrogen daidzein.\\" =Estrogenic activity= Animal experiments have shown that parabens have weak estrogenic activity, acting as xenoestrogens. In an in vivo study, the effect of butylparaben was determined to be about 1/100,000th that of estradiol, and was only observed at a dose level around 25,000 times higher than the level typically used to preserve products. The study also found that the in vivo estrogenic activity of parabens is reduced by about three orders of magnitude compared to in vitro activity. The estrogenic activity of parabens increases with the length of the alkyl group. It is believed that propylparaben is estrogenic to a certain degree as well, though this is expected to be less than butylparaben by virtue of its less lipophilic nature. Since it can be concluded that the estrogenic activity of butylparaben is negligible under normal use, the same should be concluded for shorter analogs due to estrogenic activity of parabens increasing with the length of the alkyl group. =Exposure during pregnancy= A 2020 study, published by scientists at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig (Germany) finds, that maternal paraben exposure may trigger childhood overweight development.Maternal paraben exposure triggers childhood overweight development, published by Leppert, B.; Strunz, S.; Seiwert, B.; Schlittenbauer, L.; Schlichting, R.; Pfeiffer, C.; R√∂der, S.; Bauer, M.; Borte, M.; Stangl, G.I.; Sch√∂neberg, T.; Schulz, A.; Karkossa, I.; Rolle- Kampczyk, U.E.; Th√ºrmann, L.; von Bergen, M.; Escher, B.I.; Junge, K.M.; Reemtsma, T.; Lehmann, I.; Polte, T. in Nature Communication, 2020 =Regulation= The European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) reiterated in 2013 that methylparaben and ethylparaben are safe at the maximum authorized concentrations (up to 0.4% for one ester or 0.8% when used in combination). The SCCS concluded that the use of butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products is safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%.SCCS: Opinion on Parabens. Colipa No P82 3 May 2013. Isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben, phenylparaben, benzylparaben and pentylparaben were banned by Commission Regulation (EU) No 358/2014.Commission Regulation (EU) No 358/2014 of 9 April 2014 amending Annexes II and V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products Controversy Concerns about endocrine disruptors have led consumers and companies to search for paraben-free alternatives. A common alternative has been phenoxyethanol, but this has its own risks and has led to an FDA warning on inclusion in nipple creams. Environmental considerations =Release into the environment= Paraben discharge into the environment is common due to its ubiquitous usage in cosmetic products. A 2010 study on consumer available personal care products revealed that 44% of the tested products contain parabens.Yazar K., Johnsson S., Lind M. L., Boman A., Lid√©n, C. (2011). Preservatives and fragrances in selected consumer-available cosmetics and detergents. Contact Dermatitis. 64: 265‚Äì272. When washing these products off the human body, they flow down the drain and into community wastewater. Once this occurs, the potential for parabens to accumulate within aqueous and solid mediums materializes. Some of the most common paraben derivatives found in the environment include methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben.Li W., Shi Y., Gao L., Liu J., Cai Y. (2015). Occurrence, fate and risk assessment of parabens and their chlorinated derivatives in an advanced wastewater treatment plant. Journal of Hazardous Materials 300: 29‚Äì38. Parabens flow from wastewater to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as influent where they are either removed, chemically altered, or released into the environment through sludge or tertiary effluent. General flow of parabens as they make their way through wastewater treatment plants. In one New York WWTP, mass load of all parent paraben derivatives (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, etc.) from influent wastewater was found to be 176 mg/day/1000 people.Wang W., Kannan K. (2016). Fate of Parabens and their Metabolites in two wastewater treatment plants in New York, United States. Environmental science & technology. 50: 1174‚Äì1181 When this value is used to estimate the amount of parabens entering WWTPs from the 8.5 million people currently residing in New York City for an entire year, a value of approximately 546 kg of parabens is calculated. Therefore, levels of paraben accumulation prove significant upon long-term observance. WWTPs eliminate between 92‚Äì98% of paraben derivatives; however, much of this removal is due to the formation of degradation products. Despite their reputed high elimination through WWTPs, various studies have measured high levels of paraben derivatives and degradation products persisting in the environment.Haman C., Dauchy X., Rosin C., Munoz J. (2015). Occurrence, fate, and behavior of parabens in aquatic environments: A review. Water Research. 68: 1‚Äì11. =Formation of degradation products= Chlorinated products Reaction of a general paraben with hypochlorous acid (HClO) to form mono- and di- chlorinated products. Arrow pushing mechanism of the formation of a mono- chlorinated paraben. Chlorination of propylparaben over time in water at 20¬∞C containing 0.5ŒºM propylparaben and 50ŒºM free chlorine. In addition to parent parabens, paraben degradation products that form throughout WWTP stages present a concern to the environment, including mono- and di- chlorinated parabens. When paraben-containing products are washed down the drain, parabens have the potential to undergo chlorination reactions.Mao Q., Ji F., Wang W., Wang Q., Hu Z., Yuan S. (2016) Chlorination of parabens: reaction kinetics and transformation product identification. Environ. Sci. Polut. Res. 23, 23081‚Äì23091. This reaction can occur with free chlorine present in tap water or with sodium hypochlorite, which is often used in WWTPs as a final disinfectant step.Terasaki M., Takemura Y., Makino M. (2012). Paraben- chlorinated derivatives are found in river water. Environ Chem Lett 10: 401‚Äì406 In neutral water, Raman spectroscopy has confirmed that chlorine is predominantly present as hypochlorous acid (HClO).Cherney D. P., Durik S. E., Tarr J. C., Collette T. W. (2006) Monitoring the speciation of aqueous free chlorine from pH 1 to 12 with Raman spectroscopy to determine the identity of the potent low-pH oxidant. Appl. Spectrosc. 60(7), 764‚Äì772. Parabens can react with HClO to form mono- and di- chlorinated products through electrophilic aromatic substitution. The electrophilic attack of the chlorine forms a carbocation that is stabilized by donated electron density from the hydroxyl group of the paraben.Gowda B. T., Mary M. C. (2001) Kinetics and mechanism of chlorination of phenol and substituted phenols by sodium hypochlorite in aqueous alkaline medium. Indian Journal of Chemistry. 40, 1196‚Äì1202. This step is endergonic due to the loss of aromaticity, though the hydroxyl group acts as an activating group that increases the rate. A base can then abstract a proton from the carbon containing the chlorine, which is followed by subsequent restoration of aromaticity by the involved pi electrons. Since the hydroxyl group is more activating than the ester group of the paraben, the reaction will direct in both ortho positions, as the para position is already blocked. The Arrhenius equation was used in a study to calculate activation energies for the chlorination of four parent parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben) and was found to range from 36‚Äì47kJ/mol. In another study, tap water at containing 50‚Äì200ŒºM free chlorine was spiked with 0.5ŒºM propylparaben and the composition of the mixture was monitored over 40 minutes to determine if chlorination occurs under conditions found in tap water. Results from the study confirm the disappearance of propylparaben after 5 minutes, the appearance of both 3-chloro-propylparaben and 3,5-dichloro- propylparaben paraben by 5 minutes, and the persistence of 3,5-dichloro- propylparaben as the main species remaining in the reaction. A similar, though more rapid, trend was found in a study in which the reaction temperature was increased to 35¬∞C. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) Overall reaction showing the degradation of a parent paraben to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid through base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester bond. Arrow pushing mechanism showing the degradation of a parent paraben into PHBA through base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester bond Another significant paraben degradation product is 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA). There are two mechanisms in which parabens can degrade to PHBA. The first degradation route occurs chemically. Parent parabens readily undergo base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester bond, forming PHBA. The reaction occurs under moderately alkaline conditions, specifically when the pH is ‚â• 8. This reaction is quite prevalent in household environments due to the pH range of household wastewater being 6‚Äì9 and the prevalent existence of parabens in cosmetic products. When paraben-containing cosmetic products are discharged into community wastewater influent, they become exposed to an environment where the pH ‚â• 8, and the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the parent paraben ensues, forming PHBA. In the electron transfer mechanism, the pi electrons in the double bond between the oxygen and carbonyl carbon resonate to the oxygen, leaving a negative charge on the oxygen and a positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. A hydroxide ion, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the now electrophilic carbonyl carbon, yielding sp3 hybridization on the carbonyl carbon. The electrons resonate back to form the double bond between the oxygen and the carbonyl carbon. In order to retain the original sp2 hybridization, the ‚ÄìOR group will leave. The ‚ÄìOR group acts as a better leaving group than the ‚ÄìOH group due to its ability to maintain a negative charge with greater stability. Lastly, the ‚ÄìOR-, acting as a base, will deprotonate the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate anion. The second way in which parabens can degrade into PHBA occurs biologically within WWTPs. During the secondary clarifier phase of Wastewater treatment, sludge accumulates at the bottom of the secondary clarifier. Upon separation of the liquid and solid phases of the incoming influent, parabens have a greater tendency accumulate in the sludge. This is due to its moderate hydrophobicity, as quantified by a log Kow value of approximately 1.58.4-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4-hydroxybenzoic_acid#section=Color (accessed Nov 27, 2017). This sludge is concentrated in organic nutrients; consequently, a proliferation of microorganisms becomes common within the sludge. One organism is Enterobacter cloacae, which biologically metabolizes the sludge parabens into PHBA.Nelly V., Francois L., Loredana V., Maryse D., Louisette L., Jean-Guy B., Rejean B., Francois S., Richard V. (2001) Hydrolysis of 4-Hydrobenzoic Acid Esters (Parabens) and Their Aerobic Transformation into Phenol by the Resistant Enterobacter cloacae Strain EM. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 67, 2404‚Äì2409. =Accumulation of degradation products in the environment= Through various analytical techniques such as gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, the exact levels of accumulation of paraben derivatives and degradation products in the environment have been quantified. These levels have been accurately measured in tertiary effluent and sewage sludge, as these are the primary avenues for which parabens and their degradation products reach the environment upon discharge from WWTPs. Concentrations of parabens in tertiary effluent water samples in Œºg/L (left). Concentrations of parabens in sewage sludge samples in Œºg/g (right). Paraben stability in sewage sludge is relatively high due to their ability to bind with organic matter. Soil adsorption coefficient values were calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as 1.94 (methylparaben), 2.20 (ethylparaben), 2.46 (propylparaben), and 2.72 (butylparaben),Ferreira A. M., M√∂der M., Laespada M. E. (2011) Stir bar sorptive extraction of parabens, triclosan and methyl triclosan from soil, sediment and sludge with in situ derivatization and determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. J. Chromatogr. 1218, 3837‚àí3844. all of which suggest that parabens have the ability to adhere to the organic portion of sediment and sludge, and thus, persist environmentally.Chunyang L., Sunggyu L., Hyo-Bang M., Yamashita N., Kannan K. (2013) Parabens in Sediment and Sewage Sludge from the United States, Japan, and Korea: Spatial Distribution and Temporal Trends. Environmental Science & Technology. 47(19):10895‚Äì10902. Chlorinated parabens are removed from WWTPs with only 40% efficiency in comparison to 92‚Äì98% efficiency of parent parabens. The decrease in removal efficiency can be attributed to the decreased biodegradability of chlorinated parabens, their increased overall stability throughout WWTPs, and their relatively low sorption to the sludge phase due to low log Kow values. Higher levels of PHBA are found in tertiary effluent in comparison to paraben derivatives, and PHBA exists in the highest concentration in sewage sludge. There are two reasons for these levels of accumulation. The first reason is PHBA's tendency to sorb to solid particles, which can be approximated by benzoic acid's high Kd value of approximately 19. The pKa of PHBA is 2.7, but it is in an environment of a pH between 6‚Äì9.Harashit M. (2014) Influence of Wastewater PH on Turbidity. International Journal of Environmental Research and Development. 4, 105‚Äì114.Emmanuel A., Esi A., Lawrence D., Richard A., Gabriel O. (2013) Water quality assessment of wastewater treatment plant in a Ghanaian Beverage Industry. International Journal of Water Resources and Environmental Engineering. 5, 272‚Äì279. Since the pKa is less than the pH, the carboxylic acid will be deprotonated. The carboxylate allows it to act as a sorbent on solid environmental matrices, thus promoting its aggregation in tertiary effluent, but especially sewage sludge, which acts as the solid matrix itself. The second reason is due to the intermediate increase in levels of PHBA during the secondary clarifier phase of the WWTP through biological processes. =Environmental concerns with paraben degradation products= Multiple studies have linked chlorinated parabens to endocrine disrupting functions, specifically mimicking the effects of estrogen, and chlorinated parabens are believed to be 3‚Äì4 times more toxic than their parent paraben.Vo T. T. B., Jeung E. B. (2009) An Evaluation of Estrogenic Activity of Parabens Using Uterine Calbindin-D9k Gene in an Immature Rat Model. Toxicological Sciences. 112, 68‚Äì77.Terasaki M., Makino M., Tatarazako N. (2009) Acute toxicity of parabens and their chlorinated by- products with Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri bioassays. J. Appl. Toxicol. 29, 242‚Äì247. In Daphnia magna, general toxicity conferred by chlorinated parabens occurs through non-specific disruption of cell membrane function. The potency of the chlorinated parabens correlates with the propensity of the compound to accumulate in cell membranes. Thus, chlorinated parabens generally increase in toxicity as their ester chains increase in length due to their increased hydrophobicity. The implications of PHBA's environmental accumulation also warrants attention. If the tertiary effluent is re-used for community use as greywater, it poses a hazard to humans. These hazards include, but are not limited to, abnormal fetal development, endocrine disrupting activity, and improper estrogen-promoting effects.Soni M., Carabin I., Burdock G. (2005) Safety assessment of esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (parabens). Food and Chemical Toxicology. 43, 985‚Äì1015. If the tertiary effluent is released to the environment in rivers and streams or if the sludge is used as fertilizer, it poses as a hazard to environmental organisms. It is especially toxic to those organisms on lower trophic levels, particularly various algal species. In fact, it has been shown that the LC for a specific algal species, Selenastrum capricornutum, is 0.032 micrograms per litre (Œºg/L).4-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID. SIDS Initial Assessment Report for 9th SIAM, UNEP, 1999, France. This is less than the natural abundance of PHBA in tertiary effluent at a level of 0.045Œºg/L, thus indicating that current levels of PHBA in tertiary effluent can potentially eradicate more than 50% of Selenastrum capricornutum it comes in contact with. =Removal of parabens through ozonation= Arrow pushing mechanism of the ozonation of parabens. Ozonation is an advanced treatment technique that has been considered as a possible method to limit the amount of parabens, chlorinated parabens, and PHBA that are accumulating in the environment. Ozone is an extremely powerful oxidant that oxidizes parabens and makes them easier to remove once subsequently passed through a filter.Tay K. S., Rahman N. A., Abas M. R. B. (2010) Ozonation of parabens in aqueous solutions: kinetics and mechanism of degradation. Chemosphere. 81, 1446‚Äì1453. Due to the electrophilic nature of ozone, it can easily react with the aromatic paraben ring to form hydroxylated products. Ozonation is generally regarded as a less dangerous method of disinfection than chlorination, though ozonation requires more cost considerations. Ozonation has demonstrated great efficacy in the removal of parabens (98.8‚Äì100%) and a slightly lower efficacy of 92.4% for PHBA. A moderately lower rate of removal, however, is observed for chlorinated parabens (59.2‚Äì82.8%). A proposed reaction mechanism for the removal of parabens by ozonation is detailed mechanistically.

Often, flip books are illustrated books for children, but may also be geared toward adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, frequently, using the page corners. Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.  Functionality  Rather than \\"reading\\" left to right, a viewer simply stares at the same location of the images in the flip book as the pages turn. The booklet must be flipped through with enough speed for the illusion to work, so the standard way to \\"read\\" a flip book is to hold the booklet with one hand and flip through its pages with the thumb of the other hand. The German word for flip book‚ÄîDaumenkino, which translates to \\"thumb cinema\\"‚Äîreflects this process, the photographic progression integral to film. An example of a flip book being used  History and cultural uses  A flip book It has sometimes been assumed that the relatively simple flip book has been around since long before the invention of the more complicated nineteenth-century animation devices such as the phenakistiscope (1832) and the zoetrope (1866), but no conclusive evidence has been found. There are some medieval illuminated books with sequential images, such as Sigenot (circa 1470). The illustrations in Sigenot are consistently framed and have short intervals between different phases of action, but the images cannot produce the illusion of a fluent motion. The necessary notion of instances smaller than a second would not really develop before the nineteenth century. The oldest known documentation of the flip book appeared in September 1868, when it was patented by John Barnes Linnett under the name kineograph (\\"moving picture\\"). They were the first form of animation to employ a linear sequence of images rather than circular (as in the older phenakistoscope). The German film pioneer, Max Skladanowsky, first exhibited his serial photographic images in flip book form in 1894, as he and his brother Emil did not develop their own film projector until the following year. In 1894, Herman Casler invented a mechanized form of flip book called the Mutoscope, which mounted the pages on a central rotating cylinder rather than binding them in a book. The mutoscope remained a popular attraction through the mid-twentieth century, appearing as coin-operated machines in penny arcades and amusement parks. In 1897, the English filmmaker Henry William Short marketed his \\"Filoscope\\", which was a flip book placed in a metal holder to facilitate flipping. Now flip books are largely considered a toy or novelty for children and were once a common \\"prize\\" in cereal and Cracker Jack boxes. However, in addition to their role in the birth of cinema, they have also been an effective promotional tool since their creation for such decidedly adult products as automobiles and cigarettes. They continue to be used in marketing today, as well as in art and published photographic collections. Vintage flip books are popular among collectors, and especially rare ones from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century have been known to fetch thousands of dollars in sales and auctions. A type of flip book figures prominently in the rise in fortunes of the fictional artist Tateh in Ragtime written by E. L. Doctorow and published in 1975 later included in the film and musical adaptations of the book. Since 2007, Walt Disney Animation Studios has started its films with a production logo that initially evokes a flip book. It starts with a view of an empty page of paper, then as the pages start to turn, details are drawn in to reveal Mickey Mouse in Steamboat Willie. The first international flip book festival was held in 2004, by the Akademie Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart. Another international flip book festival was held in Linz, Austria in 2005. In 2010, Hungary postal services released a flip book of stamps depicting a moving g√∂mb√∂c. The Israel Philatelic Federation released an \\"Israeli Animation Stamp Booklet\\" in November 2010 with 15 stamps designed by Mish to be animated when flipping the pages. It commemorated the 50th anniversary of ASIFA, the 25th anniversary of ASIFA Israel, and the \\"Flip Book 250th Anniversary\\".

Career Muzio made her operatic d√©but in Arezzo (15 January 1910) in the title role of Massenet's Manon, and despite her youth she made rapid progress in the opera houses of Italy, leading to d√©buts at La Scala in Milan in 1913 (as Desdemona in Verdi's Otello), in Paris (as Desdemona) and in London at Covent Garden (as Puccini's Manon Lescaut) in 1914; she stayed on in London to sing other roles including Mim√¨ and Tosca (both with Caruso). She was invited to the Met in New York in December 1916 (for Tosca) and was so successful that she continued to appear there during six successive years. It was at the Metropolitan that Muzio created the role of Giorgetta in Il tabarro, in the world premi√®re of Puccini's triple bill, Il trittico, on 14 December 1918. She established a special relationship with audiences at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, where she first appeared in June 1919 (in Catalani's Loreley). From then until 1934 she sang there in 23 different operas, becoming known as \\"la divina Claudia\\". Between 1922 and 1932, she appeared regularly in Chicago (after falling out with the management at the New York Met). On 15 October 1932, she performed the title role of Tosca to inaugurate the new War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco. Other notable roles in her career included the title role in Aida, Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier, and Leonora in Il trovatore (all in New York), and also Violetta in La traviata and Leonora in La forza del destino (in Chicago and Buenos Aires). Her last and according to some critics her greatest role was in Rome in 1934 as Cecilia in the opera of that name written for her by Licinio Refice. Her most popular role, however, was Violetta, in which she was considered unsurpassed throughout the Latin opera world (Italy, Spain, South America). Muzio was noted for the beauty and warmth of her voice, which, although not particularly large, acquired a considerable richness of tonal colouring as she grew older. Her performances were sometimes criticised for excessive use of dynamic extremes, including her exquisitely expressive pianissimo singing. She remained modest and even reclusive despite her increasing fame and wealth. Last years In her later years, Muzio experienced some financial anxiety after losing money through the extravagance of a manager/rumoured lover and then in the Wall Street crash. In 1929 she married Renato Liberati, seventeen years her junior. In 1930 she started to experience some health problems, but continued singing and recording. On 24 May 1936, after a short illness, she died in a Rome hotel of what was officially described as heart failure, aged 47. She is buried in the Cimitero del Verano in Rome. Her goddaughter was the soprano Claudia Pinza Bozzolla. Recordings Muzio is represented by recordings from various stages of her career, but few of them are from the period of her greatest successes in the late 1920s and early 1930s. She also recorded primarily for two companies whose distribution was limited and erratic: Path√© and Edison. Muzio's Path√© discs are of mixed quality due to Path√©'s problematic recording process ‚Äì artists recorded to cylinder masters which were then pantographically transferred to disc masters for making stampers, and frequency range loss and distortion often occurred during the cylinder-to-disc processing. Her Edison recordings, however, represent not only some of the best operatic recordings released by that company, but also Muzio's power and ability to project her personal intensity through the difficult acoustic recording process. She was aided at Edison by chief recordist Walter Miller and staff conductor Cesare Sodero. *1911. HMV.

Muzio personally produced and financed a set of 26 recordings for Columbia in 1934 and 1935. By 1935, there is some noticeable weakening of the top of her voice but her expressive powers are well-displayed, especially in \\"Addio del passato\\" from Verdi's La traviata. They are the recordings by which she has been best remembered.

The volcano was known as Gagxanul in the local K'iche' language, before the 16th century Spanish conquest of the region.Recinos 1952, 1986, p.69. The VEI-6 eruption of Santa Mar√≠a Volcano in 1902 was one of the three largest eruptions of the 20th century, after the 1912 Novarupta and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruptions. It is also one of the five biggest eruptions of the past 200 (and most likely 300) years. Geological history Santa Mar√≠a Volcano is part of the Sierra Madre range of volcanoes, which extends along the western edge of Guatemala, separated from the Pacific Ocean by a broad plain. The volcanoes are formed by the subduction of the Cocos Plate under the Caribbean Plate, which led to the formation of the Central America Volcanic Arc. Eruptions at Santa Mar√≠a are estimated to have begun about 103 ka. Construction of the volcanic edifice occurred in four phases, from 103-72, 72, 60-46, and 35-25 ka , building up the large cone that reaches about above the plain on which the nearby city of Quetzaltenango sits. Following the cone- building eruptions, activity seems to have changed to a pattern of long periods of repose followed by the emission of small lava flows from vents on the mountain. 1902 eruption Steam rises from Santiaguito. The area of the flank destroyed by the 1902 eruption can be clearly seen. Lahar deposits snake down river valleys to the left of the image Santa Mar√≠a, 1902 eruption 200px The first eruption of Santa Mar√≠a in recorded history occurred in October 1902. Before 1902 the volcano had been dormant for at least 500 years and possibly several thousand years, but its awakening was clearly indicated by a seismic swarm in the region starting in January 1902, which included a major earthquake in April 1902. The eruption began on 24 October, and the largest explosions occurred over the following two days, ejecting an estimated of magma. The eruption was one of the largest of the 20th century, only slightly less in magnitude to that of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, thus being 'Colossal'. The pumice formed in the climactic eruption fell over an area of about , and volcanic ash as far away as San Francisco, away. The eruption occurred out of a vent on the southwest side of the volcano, leaving a crater about in diameter and about deep, stretching from just below the summit to an elevation of about . The first evidence of the eruption was a sprinkling of sand on Quezaltenango. The wind then changed from the south to the east and ashes began to fall at Helvetia, a coffee plantation six miles to the South-West. Because of the lack of recorded eruptive activity at Santa Mar√≠a, local people did not recognise the preceding seismicity as warning signs of an eruption. Estimates are that 6,000 people died as a result of the eruption. In the middle of the disaster, Quetzaltenango regional authorities had to take charge, as the central government was focused on the celebration of the \\"Fiestas Minervalias\\", the largest propaganda festival of president Manuel Estrada Cabrera' regime; furthermore, the central government was so focused on the festival that it tried to minimize the impact of the eruption and went as far as tell the citizens that it was not in Guatemalan soil, but in M√©xico. Furthermore, the official government response was to tell Quetzaltenango authorities that there were no funds for the recovery, as those were already spent to help after the April 1902 earthquake. Under such circumstances, Quetzaltenango regional authorities declared that all the West zone agricultural harvest was ruined, and forecasted famine due to food shortages; likewise, cattle were dying and there were meat shortages as well. They were allowed by the central government to import flour free of taxes for the next few months. For the native people the eruption consequences were catastrophic: they not only lost relatives, friends, homes and harvest, but they were also forced to work free of charge in the recovery while \\"criollo\\" landlords were compensated for the loss with lands that were confiscated from native communities in San Miguel Uspant√°n Quich√© Department, Panam in Suchitep√©quez Department and in Solol√° Department. =1902 eruption sequence of events= * 24 October: 5:00 pm: At San Felipe a sound was heard, similar to the roar of a waterfall, for five minutes, coming from the volcano; but the mist surrounding the volcano did not allow any direct observation of what was happening. * 24 October: 6:00 pm: Cinders and ashes started falling over Quetzaltenango * 24 October: 7:00 pm: Witnesses recall seeing lightning and a strong fiery red light coming from the volcano, and noise similar of that of an industrial furnace. * 24 October: 8:00 pm: From San Felipe one could see a giant plume of black ash with numerous whirlwinds crossed by thousands of lightning bolts and curved lines of red light. All the area surrounding the volcano kept shaking and large explosions could be heard as far as away; strong winds carried ash and debris as far as away, or even more; a part of the cloud hovered on the north side of the cone for days, and a pitch black darkness ensued. * 25 October: 1:00 am: The eruption became more violent and large rocks from the volcano started falling as far as away, destroying towns and farm houses. * 26 October: 12:00 am: The volcano calmed down. * 26 October: 3:00 pm: Another eruption, but this time it was a white plume that came out, which was likely composed of water vapor. =Image gallery= Image:Santamaria1902erupcion.jpg Image:Santamaria1902erupcion2.jpg Image:Santamaria1902xela.jpg Santiaguito Santiaguito, 2016 eruption The 1902 eruption was followed by 20 years of dormancy. New eruptions began in 1922, with the extrusion of a lava dome complex in the crater left by the 1902 eruption. The lava dome complex, which was named Santiaguito, is still active today with over 1km3 of lava erupted so far. The lava dome complex has four main domes: El Caliente, La Mitad, El Monje and El Brujo. The currently active vent is El CalienteJeannie A.J. Scott (2013), \\"The Santiaguito volcanic dome complex, Guatemala,\\" https://vhub.org/resources/2268. The dome growth has been both endogenous and exogenous. The former implies dome interior expansion to accommodate new lava and the latter refers to superficial piling up of lava. Activity has been concentrated at several different vents, and Santiaguito now has the appearance of several overlapping domes. At the beginning of dome growth the composition was dacite, identical to the composition of the Santa Maria eruption. By 1990 the composition had shifted to a less evolved andesite. It has been proposed that this is due to a stratified magma chamber beneath the volcano. The early (pre-1990) exogenous volcanism has consisted of lava spines and lava flows. Nowadays, only lava flows are erupted. All the volcanic activity is cyclic with 10+ year cyclic timescales between periods of high volcanism with high extrusion rates and low volcanism with low extrusion rates.Harris, A. J. L., Rose, W. I., and Flynn, L. P. (2003). Temporal trends in lava dome extrusion at Santiaguito 1922-2000. Bull. Volcanol. 65, 77‚Äì89. doi: 10.1007/s00445-002-0243-0 The latest with high extrusion rate was in 2011-2015 with the emplacement of more than four new lava flows. Frequent small eruptions and pyroclastic flows have been ongoing throughout dome growth. Although most of Santiaguito's eruptive activity has been relatively gentle, occasional larger explosions have occurred. In 1929 part of the dome collapsed, generating pyroclastic flows which killed anywhere from several hundred up to 5,000 people.Sapper & Termer, 1930 Occasional rockfalls have generated smaller pyroclastic flows, and vertical eruptions of ash to heights of a few kilometres above the dome are common. Santiaguito is now a tourist attraction, as minor eruptions occur with regularity and can be observed by visitors from the summit of Santa Maria. Volcanic hazards at Santa Mar√≠a A hot lahar rushes down a river valley near El Palmar in 1989 The areas to the south of Santa Mar√≠a are considerably affected by volcanic activity at Santiaguito. Currently, the most common volcanic hazards at Santa Mar√≠a are lahars, which frequently occur in the rainy season due to heavy rainfall on loose volcanic deposits. Lahars are particularly large and frequent during periods of high volcanism at Santiaguito. The town of El Palmar, from Santiaguito, has been destroyed twice by lahars from Santiaguito forcing the town to be moved to the present Nuevo El Palmar, and infrastructure such as roads and bridges have been repeatedly damaged. Lahar deposits from Santiaguito have affected rivers all the way downstream to the Pacific Ocean. Near constant lava flows occur from Santiaguito, and can reach up to 4km from the vent. Lava flow activity occurs in cycles, with the longest lava flows occurring during times of high volcanic activity. Much shorter lava flows occur during the longer periods of low volcanic activity. These lava flows flow only a short distance from the vent before collapsing. The magma at Santiaguito is rich in silica and is thus highly viscous. The lava flows are slow moving and mostly cause property damage, although in the past catastrophic pyroclastic flows have been triggered from lava flows, which have extended several kilometers towards the westRose, W. I. (1973). Nu√©e ardente from Santiaguito Volcano April 1973. Bull. Volcanol. 37, 365‚Äì371.. One hazard which could be devastating is the collapse of Santa Mar√≠a itself. The 1902 crater has left the southern flank of the mountain above Santiaguito highly over-steepened, and a large earthquake or eruption from Santiaguito could trigger a huge landslide, which might cover up to . However, this is thought to be unlikely in the short term. In light of the threat it poses to nearby populations, Santa Mar√≠a has been designated a Decade Volcano, identifying it as a target for particular study by volcanologists to mitigate any future natural disasters at the volcano.

Murray shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 with E. Donnall Thomas for their discoveries concerning \\"organ and cell transplantation in the treatment of human disease.\\" Early life and education Murray was born to William A. and Mary (n√©e DePasquale) Murray, and grew up in Milford, Massachusetts. He was of Irish and Italian descent.Joseph E. Murray and the \\"Story of the First Human Kidney Transplant\\" A star athlete at the Milford High School, he excelled in football, ice hockey, and baseball. Upon graduation, Murray attended the College of the Holy Cross intending to play baseball; however, baseball practices and lab schedules conflicted; forcing him to give up baseball. He studied philosophy and English, earning a degree in humanities in 1940. Murray later attended Harvard Medical School. After graduating with his medical degree, Murray began his internship at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. During that time, he was inducted into the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army. He served in the plastic surgery unit at Valley Forge General Hospital in Pennsylvania. At Valley Forge General Hospital for an esteemed plastic surgeon, Bradford Cannon, and developed a lifelong passion for plastic surgery. His unit cared for thousands of soldiers wounded on the battlefields of World War II, working to reconstruct their disfigured hands and faces. His interest in transplantation grew out of working with burn patients during his time in the Army. Murray and his colleagues observed that the burn victims rejected temporary skin grafts from unrelated donors much more slowly than had been expected, suggesting the potential for organ grafts, or transplants. After his military service, Murray completed his general surgical residency, and joined the surgical staff of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. He then went to New York to train in plastic surgery at New York and Memorial Hospitals, returning to the Brigham as a member of the surgical staff in 1951. In 2001, Murray published his autobiography, Surgery Of The Soul: Reflections on a Curious Career. Career On December 23, 1954, Murray performed the world's first successful renal transplant between the identical Herrick twins at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (later Brigham and Women's Hospital), an operation that lasted five and a half hours. He was assisted by Dr. J. Hartwell Harrison and other noted physicians. In Operating Room 2 of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Murray transplanted a healthy kidney donated by Ronald Herrick into his twin brother Richard, who was dying of chronic nephritis. Richard lived for eight more years following the operation. In 1959, Murray went on to perform the world's first successful allograft and, in 1962, the world's first cadaveric renal transplant. Throughout the following years, Murray became an international leader in the study of transplantation biology, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and studies on the mechanisms of rejection. In the 1960s, top scientists investigating immunosuppressive drugs sought to work with Murray. Together, they tailored the new drug Imuran (generic azathioprine) for use in transplants. The discovery of Imuran and other anti- rejection drugs, such as prednisone, allowed Murray to carry out transplants from unrelated donors. By 1965, the survival rates after receiving a kidney transplant from an unrelated donor exceeded 65%. As a Harvard Medical School faculty member, Murray trained physicians from around the world in transplantation and reconstructive surgery, frequently performing surgeries in developing countries. In his 20 years as director of the Surgical Research Laboratory at Harvard and the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, he inspired others who became leaders in transplantation and biology throughout the world. He served as chief plastic surgeon at the Peter Bent Brigham (which later became Brigham and Women's Hospital) until 1986. He also served as chief plastic surgeon at Children's Hospital Boston from 1972‚Äì85, retiring as professor of Surgery Emeritus in 1986 from Harvard Medical School. In 1990, he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his pioneering work in organ transplantation. Murray was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences and as a regent of the American College of Surgeons. He received the American Surgical Association's Medal for Distinguished Service to Surgery, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' Francis Amory Prize, the American Association of Plastic Surgeons' Honorary Award and Clinician of the Year Award, and the National Kidney Foundation's Gift of Life Award. He was named one of the 350 most outstanding citizens, representing the medical profession, for the City of Boston's 350th anniversary. In 1991, Murray received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1996, he was appointed Academician of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in the Vatican. Personal Life Murray's father was a noted lawyer and a district court judge, mother, a school teacher.He married his college life sweetheart Bobby Link on june 1945, with whom he have 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls. Murray was selected to receive the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame in recognition of outstanding service to the Catholic Church and society in March 2005. Death Murray died on November 26, 2012, aged 93. He suffered a stroke at his suburban Boston home on Thanksgiving and died at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the very hospital where he had performed the first organ transplant operation. Murray is featured in the book Beyond Recognition, previously titled Camel Red. The book is the story of Larry Heron, who was very seriously injured in World War II, and his road to recovery, which reunited him with Murray, a former classmate.

It has been lamented that perhaps the most famous Australian of his time, [he] expressed no interest whatever in Australia. classical scholar and public intellectual, with connections in many spheres. He was an outstanding scholar of the language and culture of Ancient Greece, perhaps the leading authority in the first half of the twentieth century. He is the basis for the character of Adolphus Cusins in his friend George Bernard Shaw's play Major Barbara, and also appears as the chorus figure in Tony Harrison's play Fram. He was a prominent humanist, and served as President of the Ethical Union (now Humanists UK) from 1929-1930 and was a delegate at the inaugural World Humanist Congress in 1952 which established Humanists International.  Early life  Murray was born in Sydney, Australia. His father, Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, who died in 1873, had been a Member of the New South Wales Parliament; Gilbert's mother, Agnes Ann Murray (n√©e Edwards), ran a girls' school in Sydney for a few years. Then, in 1877, Agnes emigrated with Gilbert to the UK, where she died in 1891.Wilson, p.3 Murray was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and St John's College, Oxford. He distinguished himself in writing in Greek and Latin: he won all the prizes awarded by Oxford.  Classicist  = Academic career = From 1889‚Äì1899, Murray was Professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow.The most famous of his students there was John Buchan, whom Murray helped to take a further degree at Oxford. Others were H. N. Brailsford and Janet Spens. He left Glasgow because his health broke down. There was a break in his academic career from 1899 to 1905, when he returned to Oxford; he interested himself in dramatic and political writing. After 1908 he was Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Oxford.He was a noted and popular lecturer. Amongst those on whom he had a particular influence was Gilbert Highet. In the same year he invited Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff to Oxford, where the Prussian philologist delivered two lectures: Greek Historical Writing and Apollo (later, he would replicate them in Cambridge).The correspondance between Murray and Wilamowitz is now published in The Prussian and the Poet. The Letters of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff to Gilbert Murray (1894-1930), ed. by A. Bierl, W. M. Calder III, R. L. Fowler (Hildesheim 1991). From 1925‚Äì1926 Murray was the Charles Elliot Norton Lecturer at Harvard University. = Greek drama = Murray is perhaps now best known for his verse translations of Greek drama, which were popular and prominent in their time. As a poet he was generally taken to be a follower of Swinburne and had little sympathy from the modernist poets of the rising generation.T. S. Eliot was rude: As a poet, Mr. Murray is merely a very insignificant follower of the pre-Raphaelite movement. (from Euripides and Professor Murray, an essay in The Sacred Wood (1920)). Swinburne was in fact a youthful enthusiasm of Murray's, and Eliot's identification of it has stuck; but Murray probably preferred Tennyson for content among the Victorians (Mary Berenson reported this in 1903, and it still held good 50 years on, West p.249.) The staging of Athenian drama in English did have its own cultural impact.From the 1880s onwards, amateur performances in Greek had been popular, particularly for students dramaticals. See on this The Invention of Jane Harrison (2000) by Mary Beard. He had earlier experimented with his own prose dramas, without much success. Over time he worked through almost the entire canon of Athenian dramas (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides in tragedy; Aristophanes in comedy). From Euripides, the Hippolytus and The Bacchae (together with The Frogs of Aristophanes; first edition, 1902);First published in: The Athenian Drama, vol. III: Euripides (Euripides: Hippolytus; The Bacchae. Aristophanes: The Frogs. Translated into English rhyming verse), 1902 (); many reprints (together, separate, repackaged). the Medea, Trojan Women, and Electra (1905‚Äì1907); Iphigenia in Tauris (1910); The Rhesus (1913) were presented at the Court Theatre, in London.See The Court theatre 1904‚Äì1907: a commentary and criticism by Desmond MacCarthy, 1966 reissue with Stanley Weintraub. In the United States Granville Barker and his wife Lillah McCarthy gave outdoor performances of The Trojan Women and Iphigenia in Tauris at various colleges (1915). The translation of ≈ídipus Rex was a commission from W. B. Yeats.R. F. Foster, W. B. Yeats: A Life I p.334; early 1905. Foster also notes that Yeats and Murray corresponded about the Stage Society. Yeats was being provocative: Oedipus Rex could not be publicly presented on the British stage , because the incest was unacceptable to the censors. Foster (II p.338) notes that it was two decades later that the play was actually performed, but by then Yeats had adapted the Murray text, and R. C. Jebb's, and made cuts, for a rather different result. Until 1912 this could not have been staged for a British audience. Murray was drawn into the public debate on censorship that came to a head in 1907Wilson p.172 and was pushed by William Archer, whom he knew well from Glasgow, George Bernard Shaw,Shaw was a friend, from Murray's time around 1902 looking into Fabianism‚ÄîShaw had used Murray's marriage to Lady Mary Howard in 1905 as the basis for that of Barbara and Adolphus in Major Barbara; see for example Michael Holroyd's biography of Shaw, for Murray providing ideas for Act III; also \\"In More Ways than One\\": Major Barbara's Debt to Gilbert Murray, Sidney P. Albert, Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 20, No. 2 (May 1968), pp. 123‚Äì140 and others such as John Galsworthy, J. M. Barrie and Edward Garnett. A petition was taken to Herbert Gladstone, then Home Secretary, early in 1908. = The Ritualists = He was one of the scholars associated with Jane Harrison in the myth-ritual school of mythography.Noel Annan (The Dons: Mentors, Eccentrics and Geniuses, 1999, p.243) wrote Gilbert Murray's remark that no one can write about Greek religion without being influenced by Jane Harrison seems truer now than when he made it. They met first in 1900.West p.132 say 1902 in Cambridge; but Wilson p. 119 says 1900 in Switzerland. In both cases it was through A. W. Verrall. Both books say they met at Bernard Berenson's Florence home in 1903, as Harrison was finishing Prolegomena, and discussed it. He wrote an appendix on the Orphic tablets for her 1903 book Prolegomena; he later contributed to her Themis (1912).Excursus on the Ritual Forms Preserved in Greek Tragedy; reprinted in The Myth and Ritual Theory (1998), edited by Robert A. Segal. The editorial introduction writes (p.95) Murray views tragedy as the legacy of the ritualistic enactment of the myth of the life and death of Dionysius. Francis Fergusson wrote  In public life  = Liberal Party politics = He was a lifelong supporter of the Liberal Party, lining up on the Irish Home RuleWilson, p.20: Murray founded an Oxford Home Rule League in 1886 and non-imperialist sides of the splits in the party of the late nineteenth century. He supported temperance,Wilson, p.21 and married into a prominent Liberal, aristocratic and temperance family, the Carlisles. He made a number of moves that might have taken him into parliamentary politics, initially by tentative thoughts about standing in elections during the 1890s. In 1901-2 he was in close contact with the Independent Labour Party.Wilson, p.75 But the overall effect of the Second Boer War was to drive him back into the academic career he had put on hold in 1898, resigning his Glasgow chair (effective from April 1899). He stood five times unsuccessfully for the University of Oxford constituency between 1919 and 1929. He continued support for the Asquith faction of Liberals, after the party was split again by Lloyd George.Wilson, see index p.467 for details and his academic elections against Lloyd George and Bonar Law, which were equally unsuccessful.In 1921 Murray was trying a scheme on Asquith to promote a new progressive grouping under Edward Grey (West p.184); but this proved impractical kingmaking.Noel Annan, in Our Age: The Generation that made Post- War Britain (1990) provides (p.236) a list of Liberal Party intellectuals of the 1920s capable of attracting the younger generation; Murray is listed there with Maynard Keynes, Hubert Henderson, Walter Layton, Ramsay Muir, Ernest Simon, Roy Harrod. Another list including Murray (p.32) is with J. A. Hobson, L. T. Hobhouse, J. L. Hammond and his wife Barbara Hammond (both close friends of Murray), Graham Wallas, H. W. Nevinson and H. W. Massingham, as 'the newly educated classes of the left' and 'reformers'. During the 1930s the Liberals as a party were crushed electorally, but Liberal thinkers continued to write; Murray was one of the signatory Next Five Years Group formed around Clifford Allen.‚Ä¶ after Lloyd George had become the Independent Liberal in 1931, many remaining Liberals participated in the Next Five Years group, who proposed an aggressive industrial policy and management of banking and finance similar to the Yellow Book. It is true that the group called themselves nonpartisan, and in fact one of the core members was Harold Macmillan. However, as Freeden indicates, the Liberal tendency of the group was obvious as a whole. Geoffrey Crowther and Salter, both Liberals, were responsible for the first section of the book dealing with domestic affairs. The signatories included Layton, Rowntree, Cadbury, Isaac Foot, H. A. L. Fisher, Gilbert Murray, J. L. Hammond, and Hobson, other than several Liberal MPs. From paper by Tomoari Matsunaga, PDF . = Activist = The International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in 1939, chaired by Murray (at the central table).As Regius Professor and literary figure, he had a platform to promote his views, which were many-sided but Whig-liberal.Robert L. Fowler, who has read and reflected on a huge amount of Murray's work, places him in context: a Liberal concerned with social organization, a League of Nations supporter, a vegetarian offended by the slaughter of the Gadarene swine, decent and generous, deeply influenced by the historicism of Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. Murray wrote Five Stages of Greek Religion in part to \\"counteract Jane Harrison's exaltation of the chthonic spirits by a vigorous defence of the Olympian deities,\\" who for Murray characterized the Greek mind during the period of \\"true Hellenism\\" ending with the end of the Peloponnesian War. Murray's gods were morally, intellectually, and politically good, opposing the \\"megalomania and blood-lust\\" of earlier Greek religion and favoring the city- state. This is from Daniel P. Tompkins writing in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review. Wiliamowitz and Murray had been in touch as correspondents since the mid-1890s (Wilson p.55). In 1912 he wrote an introduction to The Great Analysis: A Plea for a Rational World-Order, by his friend William Archer.It proposed the founding of an International College of Systematic Sociology. Composed of scholars and politicians from all nations, the College would monitor and interpret global affairs, its university anticipating the crises to be solved by its parliamentarians. Archer solicited the introduction from Murray for this utopian scheme, and then had it published anonymously as far as identifying himself as author. Andrew Carnegie was approached for funding, without result. (Peter Whitebrook (1993) William Archer: A Biography. p.307.) During World War I he became a pamphleteer, putting a reasoned war case. He also defended C. K. Ogden against criticism,Wilson p.236; this was in March 1917 and took a public interest in conscientious objection.In the case of the Quaker Stephen Hobhouse, Murray wrote an introduction to a pamphlet I appeal unto Caesar: the case of the conscientious objector by his mother Margaret. His father, Henry Hobhouse, was a Liberal MP from 1885 to 1906, and although a 'country squire' (Concise Dictionary of National Biography) was a Privy Councillor; and brother to L. T. Hobhouse, an old friend of Murray's. Murray was incensed at the treatment meted out to Stephen Hobhouse, who had been rejected as not a genuine objector of conscience (The Soul as It is and How to Deal with It, 1918 paper ), and further wrote an introduction to Hobhouse's post-war book on prisons.He intervened directly in the case of Raymond Postgate (Wilson p.237). In a scare about the possible application of martial law to objectors, he contacted Lord Derby, the Secretary of War, and H. H. Asquith the Prime Minister face-to-face (Wilson p. 239). Murray never took a pacifist line himself, broke an old friendship with Bertrand Russell early in the war,Murray was active in helping Russell when the latter was imprisoned; see West p.145 on pacifism, Wilson p.241 on aid to Russell. Murray, close to H. H. Asquith, had no time for David Lloyd George who displaced him as Prime Minister. and supported British intervention in the Suez Crisis. He was also involved as an internationalist in the League of Nations. He was a Vice- President of the League of Nations Society from 1916,Wilson p.247 and in 1917 wrote influential articles in the Daily News.Wilson, p.248 At the invitation of Jan Smuts he acted in 1921/2 as a League delegate for South Africa.Wilson p.249Murray's League activities extended to post-WWI intellectual revival, where he spoke up for funding for Germany (then not a League member); see E. M. Forster's life of Murray's deputy Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson. He was an influential member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League from 1922 to 1939, being its president from 1928 to 1939. Later he was a major influence in the setting-up of OxfamOxfam was not initially known by that name at that point, post-WWII. A leading figure in this campaign was Professor Gilbert Murray (1866‚Äì1957).[‚Ä¶] He was a founder of the League of Nations Union, a citizen support group for international peace. As famine in Greece became severe in the autumn of 1941 the League of Nations Union appointed a 'Committee on Starvation in Occupied Countries'. In October 1941 Murray and Lord Robert Cecil, Viscount Chelwood (1864‚Äì1958), Joint presidents, sought a meeting with the Ministry of Economic Warfare to establish whether anything more could be done to relieve starvation in occupied countries.[‚Ä¶]Murray remained in Oxford after his retirement and was closely associated with the development of Oxfam as a founder and trustee. After the war he was joint president, 1945‚Äì1947 and 1949‚Äì1957, and sole president, 1947‚Äì1949, of the United Nations Association. From RTF file at www.oxfam.org.ni/about_us/history/oxfamorigins.rtf .A Gilbert Murray Memorial Lecture for Oxfam has been given from 1959, endowed after his death.

G. Wells. Initially this was in 1917 and connection with groups supporting a future League: Wells promoted a League of Free Nations Association (LFNA), an idea not in fact exclusive to him, since it had been 'up in the air' since Woodrow Wilson had started considering post-war settlements. Wells applied through the British propaganda office with which Murray had been connected since 1914. The two men corresponded from 1917 about League matters.A. B. McKillop, The Spinster and the Prophet (2000) p.143 Wells was bullish about pushing ahead with a British LFNA, Murray was involved already in the League of Nations Society (LNS), though not active. The political position was delicate, as Murray understood and Wells may not have: the LNS overlapped with the Union of Democratic Control, which was too far towards the pacifist end of the spectrum of opinion to be effective in that time and context. Eventually in 1918 the LFNA was set up around Welsh Liberal MP David Davies, and then shortly the LFNA and LNS merged as the League of Nations Union.[The FNLA] members were mostly good haters of Germany and people of importance and influence [‚Ä¶] The idea of a League was becoming reputable chiefly owing to President Wilson [‚Ä¶] ‚Ä¶ The 'Society' [LNS] sent its chairman W. H. Dickinson, G.L.D., J. A. Hobson and L. S. Woolf. The 'Association' [LFNA] sent C. A. McCurdy, Gilbert Murray, Wickham Steed, H. G. Wells. The dinner was a success [‚Ä¶]. E.M. Forster, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, p.169. Two years later, Wells called on Murray, and Murray's New College colleague Ernest Barker, to lend their names as advisers on his The Outline of History. Their names duly appeared on the title page.The other advisers were E. Ray Lankester, Harry Johnston. Murray had to give evidence in the plagiarism case Deeks v. Wells that arose in 1925.McKillop, The Spinster and the Prophet covers this all thoroughly = Psychical research = Murray held a deep interest in psychical research.Lowe, N. (2007).

Between 1916 and 1924, he conducted 236 experiments into telepathy and reported 36% as successful, although it was suggested that the results could be explained by hyperaesthesia as he could hear what was being said by the sender.Payne, Kenneth Wilcox.

These experiments were successful. Most of the time the target was spoken aloud. When it was not, there were negative results. This is suggestive of a hyperacuity of hearing, especially since on at least one occasion Murray complained about noise coming from a milk-cart in the street next to the one in which the experiments were being carried out.\\"Mauskopf, Seymour H; McVaugh, Michael Rogers.

Oxford University Press. p. 280  Humanism  Murray is often identified as a humanist, typically with some qualification ('classical', 'scholarly', 'engaged', 'liberal'). He joined the Rationalist Press Association, and in 1952 attended the World Humanist Congress. He wrote and broadcast extensively on religion (Greek, Stoic and Christian); and wrote several books dealing with his version of humanism.No one was exactly sure what Murray believed. His publisher Stanley Unwin took him as Rationalist and not Christian, but found him most Christian-like. (Memoirs of a Publisher). Ford Madox Ford, not always a reliable witness, describes in Return to Yesterday (p.229) a rigmarole Murray produced at a house party of Edward Clodd's, around 1905: Murray had some sort of patent faith of which all I can remember is that a black velvet coffin played a part in it. Murray's interest in some aspects of parapsychology is well documented. A. R. Orage's criticism of Murray (The New Age, 1913) as 'eclectic' applies. E. R. Dodds, Murray's pupil and successor, was advised to keep away from religion; Dodds might be taken as a more explicit rationalist in a line descending from Frazer. Murray's view on religion wasn't really separate from his Whiggishness. He was President of the British Ethical Union (now Humanists UK) from 1929-1930. A phrase from his 1910 lectures Four Stages of Greek Religion enjoyed public prominence: the \\"failure of nerve\\" of the Hellenistic world, of which a turn to irrationalism was symptomatic.Stephen Weldon, writing on a humanist site, argues that In many ways, the failure of nerve thesis was merely one version of an anticlerical view of history common during the Enlightenment period, a view that depicted the religionists as cowards and the rationalists as heroes. Murray's innovation was to encapsulate that attitude in a compelling argument, expressing historical causality in terms of individual psychology. Weldon goes on to point to the way Sidney Hook later took up the theme. Murray was baptised as a Roman Catholic; his father was a Catholic, his mother a Protestant. His daughter Rosalind (later Rosalind Toynbee), a Catholic convert, attacked his secularism in her book of apologetics, The Good Pagan's Failure (1939). About a month before he died, when he was bedridden, his daughter Rosalind called the local Catholic priest to see him.\\"The Faith and Dr Gilbert Murray\\", John Crozier, New Blackfriars, Volume 72, Issue 848, Page 188-193, April 1991 Rosalind subsequently claimed that Murray was then reconciled to the Catholic Church; other family members, however, contested her version of the events.  Awards and honours  He refused a knighthood in 1912,Wilson p.193 though he was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1941. He received honorary degrees from Glasgow, Birmingham, and Oxford.New International Encyclopedia He gave the 1941 Andrew Lang lecture. Minor planet 941 Murray is named after him, for his support of Austria after World War I.  Family  Murray's father was Sir Terence Aubrey Murray and his brother Sir Hubert Murray. Murray's mother, Agnes Ann Murray (n√©e Edwards), was a cousin of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert. Murray married Lady Mary Henrietta Howard (1865‚Äì1956), daughter of George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle. When her mother Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle died in 1921, Castle Howard was left to Lady Mary. However, she passed it on to her surviving brother Geoffrey,Wilson, p.261-2.

Pacaya rises to an elevation of . After being dormant for over 70 years, it began erupting vigorously in 1961 and has been erupting frequently since then. Much of its activity is Strombolian, but occasional Plinian eruptions also occur, sometimes showering the area of the nearby Departments with ash. Pacaya is a popular tourist attraction. Pacaya lies 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of Guatemala City and close to Antigua.Google Earth The volcano sits inside the Escuintla Department. So far, the last activity reported has been the eruption that peaked on March 2, 2014, causing ash to rain down in Guatemala City, Antigua, and Escuintla. Geological history The Pacaya volcano is a part of the Central American Volcanic Arc, a chain of volcanoes stretching from the northwest to the southeast along the Pacific coast of Central America, formed by the tectonic subduction of the Cocos Tectonic Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate. Pacaya lies on the southern edge of a sizable volcanic caldera formed in the Pleistocene age which contains Lago de Amatitl√°n. This caldera has been the source of at least nine very large explosions over the past 300,000 years, erupting a total of about of magma. After the last caldera-forming eruption 23,000 years ago several smaller vents within and around the caldera have seen eruptive activity. Pacaya is the largest post-caldera volcano, and has been one of Central America's most active volcanoes over the last 500 years. It has erupted at least 23 times since the Spanish conquest, producing basalt and basaltic andesite.Guatemala Volcanoes About 1,100 years ago, the volcano's edifice collapsed, causing a huge landslide. Deposits from the landslide travelled about from the volcano down to the Pacific coastal plain. The landslide left a large crater, within which the current active cone has grown. The presence of a magma chamber at shallow depths beneath Pacaya means that distortion of the cone leading to instability and future landslides remains a hazard to the surrounding areas. Recent eruptions Pacaya Volcano With its almost continuous activity, the volcano has been a popular location for tourism. Pacaya is easily accessible from Guatemala City and from Antigua. The volcano and surrounding area now lie within the Pacaya National Park, which was created to supervise and protect tourism in this region. The Pacaya Park generates its income from tour groups who are charged a small fee to enter the park. In 1998, several explosive eruptions emitted lava, debris and ash columns with a height of to . Ash fall affected nearby cities including Guatemala city and La Aurora International Airport. During 2006, a slight increase in Pacaya's volcanic activity brought about the creation of several lava rivers that slowly flow down its slope. Word about these phenomena spread, and local tourism increased significantly. =May 2010 eruption= On May 27, 2010, the Pacaya volcano erupted, followed by several tremors. At approximately 20:00 hours there was a strong eruption ejecting debris and ash columns up to . Ash rained down in many Guatemalan cities to the northwest of the volcano, including Guatemala City. The volcanic ash fall pelted Guatemala City, and the international airport, La Aurora. The National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) declared a red alert for the communities near the volcano and recommended the evacuation of some of them. Noti7 reporter Anibal Archila, one of the first to cover the event, was reportedly killed by volcanic debris. President √Ålvaro Colom declared a state of calamity in the region adjacent to the volcano, and the Ministry of Education closed the schools in the departments of Guatemala, Escuintla, and Sacatepequez. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Agatha worsened the emergency situation, causing lahars, landslides and widespread flooding across the country. However, people working in coffee fields considered the rain brought by the storm to be helpful, removing ash from their trees.

The concept has been applied more generally to other hospitality settings and to personal concierges who manage the errands of private clients. Duties and functions The concierge serves guests of an apartment building, hotel, or office building with duties similar to those of a receptionist. The position can also be maintained by a security guard over the late night shift. In medieval times, the concierge was an officer of the king who was charged with executing justice, with the help of his bailiffs. Later on in the 18th century, the concierge was a high official of the kingdom, appointed by the king to maintain order and oversee the police and prisoner records. In 19th-century and early 20th-century apartment buildings, particularly in Paris, the concierge was known as a \\"Suisse\\", as the post was often filled by Swiss people. He often had a small apartment on the ground floor, called la loge, and was able to monitor all comings and goings. However, such settings are now extremely rare; most concierges in small or middle-sized buildings have been replaced by the part-time services of door-staff. Some larger apartment buildings or groups of buildings retain the use of concierges. The concierge may, for instance, keep the mail of absented dwellers, be entrusted with the apartment keys to deal with emergencies when residents are absent, provide information to residents and guests, provide access control, enforce rules, and act as a go-between for residents and management when management is not on-site. A modern concierge may also serve as a lifestyle manager, like a secretary or a personal assistant. In hotels or resorts, a concierge assists guests by performing various tasks such as making restaurant reservations, booking hotels, arranging for spa services, recommending night life hot spots, booking transportation (like taxi, limousines, airplanes, boats, etc.), coordinating porter service (luggage assistance request), procuring tickets to special events, and assisting with various travel arrangements and tours of local attractions. Concierges also assist with sending and receiving parcels. Services In hospitals, concierge services are becoming increasingly available. A hospital concierge provides similar services to those of a hotel concierge, but serves patients and employees as well. This helps hospital employees who work long shifts, and helps to provide work-life balance. There are numerous independent personal concierge companies that provide errand services and information services for their members. Services include informational requests, setting dinner reservations, making telephone calls, researching travel arrangements and more. Typically, concierge companies will bill on an hourly rate, and depending upon the type of task, fees can vary drastically. Other companies bill a flat monthly fee based upon the number of requests a member is allowed to place each month. In the United Kingdom, since the year 2000 and as of 2010, concierge has become a key marketing and loyalty tool in the banking sector and offered as a benefit on luxury credit cards. This service offering is also known as lifestyle management. Concierges also entertain their clients. Additionally, concierge services are now frequently offered as a service by financial institutions to their most valuable clients as way of retaining and attracting clients. Lifestyle and travel concierge companies such Ten Lifestyle Group often offer their service as a white-label or semi-branded product on a business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) basis. The market for concierge businesses in which Ten operates is currently worth around $1 billion. Banks who currently offer concierge services to clients include Coutts, China Merchants Bank, RBC and HSBC. In the luxury yachting industry, concierge services are available to meet the demands of yacht owners and charter guests travelling on board. Often enlisted by yacht captains and crew, yacht concierges typically provide entertainment and excursions for guests in their destination(s) and can also assist with support services for the crew and yacht itself, typically offered by ships agents. Airport concierge services help travellers make it through security, customs, and immigration faster, and provide lounge access. The owners and operators of concierge, lifestyle management and errand service businesses are supported and advocated by the non-profit International Concierge and Lifestyle Management Association (ICLMA) and the National Concierge Association. Etymology The French word concierge is likely derived from the Old French cumcerges, itself related to the Medieval Latin consergius or the Latin conservus (\\"fellow slave\\"). Another possibility, suggested by French authors as early as the 19th century, is that \\"concierge\\" is a contraction of comte des cierges (\\"count of candles\\"), a servant responsible for maintaining the lighting and cleanliness of medieval palaces.

Murphy (January 9, 1908 ‚Äì July 2, 1970) was an American film editor who, in the course of a twenty-year career, served as president of American Cinema Editors (ACE) from 1952 to 1955 and was distinguished in 1966 with ACE's Eddie Award for his work on the science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage, which also earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing.Schallert, Edwin. \\"Film Editing Awards Given Five at Dinner\\" (Los Angeles Times, March 18, 1954, page A2)\\"Film Editors Present Critics Award Plaques\\" (Los Angeles Times, October 20, 1954, page A28) Born in Mexia, a small city in Central Texas' Limestone County, William B. Murphy was 41 when his name first appeared in film credits as co-editor (with Richard Cahoon) of the independently produced 1949 B-western, Massacre River, released by United Artists. The following year, hired by 20th Century Fox, he worked on several of the studio's 1950s \\"A\\" productions, including three Clifton Webb vehicles, Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell, Elopement (both 1951) and Mister Scoutmaster (1953), as well as Howard Hawks' Cary Grant-Ginger Rogers 1952 comedy, Monkey Business, and the 1957 Pat Boone-Shirley Jones musical, April Love. He also proved adept at westerns, editing Powder River (1953), Three Young Texans, The Gambler from Natchez (both 1954), Stranger on Horseback (1955), Mohawk (1956) and The Lonely Man (1957). Leaving Fox in 1957, he served as editorial supervisor on several film and television projects (The Bachelor Party, Kings Go Forth, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet) and, by 1959, returned as a full-time editor in features and TV episodes, with credits on the independent science fiction production, 4D Man, along with at least eight installments of the hit ABC crime drama, The Untouchables. In his final decade, 1960s, Murphy edited an entry in the series of films tailored for Elvis Presley, Follow That Dream (1962), followed by a psychiatric hospital melodrama, The Caretakers (1963), and the big-budget 1965 spoof, John Goldfarb, Please Come Home. Among his last three features, another top-dollar production, Fantastic Voyage, not only had a much bigger budget than his previous sci-fi assignment, 4D Man, but also proved to be a major moneymaker, ultimately going on to become one of the year's highest-grossing films with Oscar nominations in five technical categories, two of which, Best Art Direction‚ÄîColor and Best Visual Effects, were selected as winners. Although Murphy lost in the Best Editing category to the Grand Prix team of Fredric Steinkamp, Henry Berman, Stewart Linder and Frank Santillo, his win of ACE's Eddie Award, in addition to the film's other awards and nominations (Hugo, Laurel and the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Award), brought him accolades and professional renown at near-end of his career. His penultimate film, Roger Corman's 1967 recreation of The St. Valentine's Day Massacre, returned to the same milieu he had covered while working on The Untouchables and, concluding his list of credits was Delbert Mann's The Pink Jungle, a tepidly reviewed 1968 comedy-adventure set in a South American jungle. William B. Murphy died in Los Angeles at the age of 62.

From 1942 to 1945 he was on leave from Campbell's Soup to the War Production Board. Prior to joining Campbell's Soup he was at the A.C. Nielsen Company (1928‚Äì1938) where he is credited with conceiving the idea for the Nielsen Food Index and Nielsen Drug Index Services. Murphy was also a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Murphy was born in Appleton, Wisconsin and received a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin in 1928. He subsequently joined the A.C. Nielsen Company of Chicago and rose to the position of executive vice president. He joined Campbell Soup in 1938 as Assistant to General Manager. Murphy was elected executive vice president of Campbell Soup in 1949 and was president and CEO from 1953 to 1972. Murphy died May 29, 1994 at the age of 86 of pneumonia in a convalescent home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While at Campbell's Soup Company he took the corporation public and increased its brand portfolio to include Pepperidge Farm breads, cookies, and crackers, Franco-American gravies and pastas, V8 juice (vegetable), Swanson broths, and Godiva (chocolatier). Murphy was a special term member of the MIT Corporation from 1961‚Äì65 and a life member from 1965‚Äì82. He served on several MIT standing committees, including the Auditing Committee (1984‚Äì86), the Executive Committee (1966‚Äì72 and 1976‚Äì82), and the Membership Committee (1964‚Äì67). He was a member of the visiting committees for the Department of Applied Biological Sciences (1985‚Äì88), the Department of Nutrition and Food Science (1980‚Äì85 and 1974‚Äì80 as chairman), the MIT Sloan School of Management (1972‚Äì76 and 1965‚Äì66, and 1964‚Äì65 as chairman), and the School of Industrial Management (1961‚Äì63, 1963‚Äì64 as chairman and 1959‚Äì61 as a presidential nominee). As head of Campbell Soup, Murphy's managerial style, which prioritized lean manufacturing, fostered conflict with his workers who contested his high production targets. The climax of this conflict occurred in 1968, when the AFL-CIO affiliated locals at the Campbell plants attempted to coordinate their contracts. Murphy firmly opposed the coordinated bargaining across his plants; divisions between the different locals limited their gains, and his managerial vision prevailed.D. Sidorick, Condensed Capitalism: Campbell Soup and the Pursuit of Cheap Production in the Twentieth Century, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2009, chpt. 6 In 1980, former president and chairman of the MIT Corporation Paul Gray presented Murphy with the Henry Laurence Gantt Memorial Medal. It is awarded jointly by the American Management Associations and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for \\"distinguished achievement in management as a service to the community.\\" In addition to serving on several government advisory panels, Murphy was a director of companies including AT&T;, Merck & Co., Inc., and International Paper. He also served as national chairman of Radio Free Europe in 1960‚Äì61 and as chairman of the board of trustees of the Nutrition Foundation in 1964‚Äì65.  Employment  * A.C.

His earliest strips, signed J.E. Murphy, had a crude awkward look, but as his cartooning improved, his full signature of Jimmy Murphy appeared. Born in Chicago, Murphy grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. When he was 15 he began selling political cartoons to the local newspapers, including the Omaha Examiner. He briefly attended Creighton University in Omaha, but he left home in 1910, spending the next eight years drawing political cartoons for the Inland Herald (Spokane, Washington), the Oregon Journal (Portland, Oregon) and the San Francisco Call & Post. Doc Attaboy In the summer of 1918, William Randolph Hearst beckoned, and Murphy arrived in New York for a job with Hearst's New York Journal and the New York American, where he decided to try a comic strip. For the New York American Murphy created Doc Attaboy, a strip about a middle-aged doctor more concerned with writing the bills instead of curing his patients. That short-lived strip continued until December 1918. Toots and Casper The same month he dropped Doc Attaboy, he began Toots and Casper for the American, using his wife, Matilda Katherine Crane Murphy, as the model for Toots. The strip was picked up by King Features Syndicate in 1919, and by 1925, it was being carried in numerous newspapers. He left New York and moved to California, living for decades in Beverly Hills. His hobbies of motoring and golf often interfered with his deadlines, and his business records from the 1930s revealed that he often was so late that he shipped strips east by air express. The daily Toots and Casper ran until 1951, with the Sunday strip continuing until 1956.Goulart, Ron (ed.). Encyclopedia of American Comics. New York: Facts on File, 1990. It's Papa Who Pays! 180px Beginning in 1926, he drew another Sunday comic strip, It's Papa Who Pays!, which ran above Toots and Casper as a topper until 1956. Toots and Casper remained a popular favorite with newspaper readers for decades. Between 1932 and 1941, he began including collectible stamps and paper dolls in his Sunday page. These features were so popular they were subsequently imitated by other cartoonists. Eat Right to Work and Win In 1942, Murphy joined other King Features cartoonists (Carl Anderson, Lee Falk and Ray Moore, George McManus, Alex Raymond, Otto Soglow, Russ Westover and Chic Young) in donating art for a World War II booklet on nutrition, Eat Right to Work and Win, published in Toronto by Swift Canadian Co. Ltd. The booklet was created through several contributors, the National Nutrition Program, Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services, King Features and the Office of Civilian Defense. Licensing Murphy profited from the licensing and merchandising of his creation. Toots and Casper items ran the gamut from dolls, books and pins to comic books and bisque nodders. Murphy had a circulatory ailment, and between 1950 and 1955, he endured three major abdominal operations. His illness near the end of the comic strip's run prompted the hiring of ghost artists and the recycling of earlier strips (with new dialogue). He died in Beverly Hills, California in 1965.

Finnish Americans ( ) comprise Americans with ancestral roots from Finland or Finnish people who emigrated to and reside in the United States. The Finnish American population numbers a little bit more than 650,000. History Some Finns, like the ancestors of John Morton, came to the Swedish colony of New Sweden, that existed in mid-17th century. Finns first started coming to the United States in large numbers in the late 19th century, and continued until the mid 20th century. However, there were some Finns in the United States beforehand; in particular, they were instrumental in the development of the New Sweden colony on the Delaware River, later absorbed into New Netherland. Many townships were established by Finnish Americans, including Herman, located in Baraga County, Michigan. The town is named for Herman Keranen, of Puolanka, Finland.Wargelin Brown, K. Marianne. \\"Finnish Americans.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America pp. 137-151. A significant number of Finnish immigrants also settled in northern Minnesota, especially in the Arrowhead Region, along with portions of Aitkin, Crow Wing, and Carlton counties, often working in the region's iron mines. A number of the Finns fleeing the Russification efforts also emigrated to many of the mill towns of New England where they became known for their woodworking skills. = First migrants (1640‚Äì1870) = The first immigrants to North America arrived to the New Sweden colony by the lower Delaware River in 1640. Finland was an integrated part of the Kingdom of Sweden at the time, and a Swedish colony in the New World was bound to include subjects from Finland as well. In two years' time, the number of Finns in the settlement had grown to fifty, and was increasing. New Sweden changed hands to Dutch control in 1655, but many Finns had already entered, and the Finnish community, while still small, was growing. Among the Finnish settlers of New Sweden was Martti Marttinen, who came to North America in 1654 and changed his name to Morton. John Morton, the politician who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence on behalf of Pennsylvania in 1776, was his great-grandson. Migration to North America from Finland continued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, but it was very sporadic in nature and only a few individuals and groups dared make the move. This was largely due to the long distance between Europe and America, and the difficulties associated with crossing it. However, as the Industrial Revolution began with the turn of the 19th century, bringing with it such technological innovations as railways and steam ships, these obstacles slowly began to disappear. While the rest of Europe was industrializing, Finland, by now a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire, was to a great extent excluded from the revolutionary process. The society was largely agrarian, and unemployment was rising, resultant from population growth and the fact that there was now little land left to cultivate in the country. America, on the other hand, possessed abundant natural resources but lacked a work force. Rural life in Finland during the 1860s seemed doomed to remain laborious, stunted, and forever at the mercy of unpredictable weather. In 1867, a severe crop failure in Finland drove masses of Finns, especially from rural Ostrobothnia, into migrating to Norway, from where they later moved to the United States and Canada.  Religion  The Laestadian Finns longed for a rural way of life and religious toleration which they believed they would find in America. So a group of Laestadian preachers and followers immigrated to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan bringing their beloved sermons. In 1873 the Finnish Laestadians started their own congregation at Calumet, Michigan. By 1906 the Laestadian movement in America resulted in 68 churches and a communicant body of over 8,000. Today the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America remains in Calumet, Michigan. =The Great Migration (1870‚Äì1930)= The years between 1870 and 1930 are sometimes referred as the Great \\"Migration\\" of Finns into North America. In the 1870s, there were only 3,000 migrants from Finland, but this figure was rapidly growing. New migrants often sent letters home, describing their life in the New World, and this encouraged more and more people to leave and try their luck in America. Rumors began of the acres of land that could be cleared into vast productive fields and the opportunity to earn \\"a barrel of American dollars\\" in mines, factories, and railroads. There were also professional recruiters, or \\"agents,\\" employed by mining and shipping companies, who encouraged Finns to move to the United States. More than 90% of the Finnish immigrants lived in urban centers. This activity was frowned upon by the authorities of the Grand Duchy, and was mostly done in secret. It was eventually brought to an end in the late 1880s by legislation in the U.S., but the decade still saw a 12-fold increase in the number of Finnish migrants compared to the previous decade, as 36,000 Finns left their home country for North America. The movement was strengthened even further in 1899, as the Russian government started an aggressive, coordinated campaign for the Russification of Finland. Many Finns chose to escape the repression by migrating into the New World, and, during the 1900s, there were 150,000 new migrants. Most Finns who left for America came from the impoverished rural regions of Ostrobothnia. Other prominent points of departure were Northern Savonia and the Torne Valley. Many of the emigrants left by ship from the port town of Hanko. Suomi Hall, a meeting hall of Finnish immigrants, in Astoria, Oregon. In the years surrounding the turn of the 20th Century, settlement was focused around three specific regions: * Several pockets of Finnish settlement appeared in New England. New York City and Boston, Massachusetts were the prime destinations for scores of skilled and general laborers. Cities such as Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, and Monessen, Pennsylvania attracted thousands of Finns to settle in both urban and rural settings. * In the Upper Midwest, a similar pattern rapidly took shape. Due to the region's similar geographic and climatic features to Finland, the heaviest levels of Finnish Settlement were seen in an area known as the Finn Hook, which includes northeastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where Finns were heavily invested in mining and agriculture. At the same time, because of the connections between these sectors and Great Lakes shipping, another area of Finnish settlement formed in northeastern Ohio, with its core located in the port city of Ashtabula and the nearby towns of Conneaut, Painesville and Fairport Harbor. Today, the region is known as having the highest population of Americans of Finnish ancestry of any region in the United States; in the northwestern half of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan they make up the plurality of population. * In addition, a number of rural and urban locations in the Northwestern United States contained a number of Finnish-settled areas. Cities such as Aberdeen, Washington and Astoria, Oregon were known for being prime destinations for Finnish immigrants. The immigration of Finns gave birth to a strong Finnish American culture, especially in cities such as Duluth and Ashtabula, Ohio, and many villages were named after places in Finland (such as Toivola, Minnesota, Savo, South Dakota, and Oulu, Wisconsin). The Finnish exodus took place after most of the available farmland in the U.S. was already taken and Canada's was largely still up for grabs. While many of them did pursue farming, many Finnish immigrants also received employment in mining, construction, and the forest industry, while the women usually worked as maids. In the case of the Finnish- American enclave in the Finger Lakes region south of Ithaca, New York early in the 20th century, Finns left urban jobs in order to acquire farms that had been played out by previous owners. The migration continued well into the 20th century, until the U.S. authorities set up a quota of 529 Finnish immigrants per year in 1929. This reduced the flow somewhat, and as was seen in many northern European countries at the time, social and economic conditions in Finland improved significantly, resulting in the flow effectively decreasing by the mid-20th century. The American revolutionary James P. Cannon noted that a considerable part of these immigrants tended to the radical left in politics: \\"Under the impact of the Russian Revolution the foreign-born socialist movement grew by leaps and bounds. The foreign-born were organized in language federations, practically autonomous bodies affiliated to the Socialist Party. [Among others] there were about twelve thousand Finns, organized in their own federation\\".James P. Cannon, \\"The History of American Trotskyism\\", Ch. 1 = Return = Most Finnish migrants had planned to stay only a few years in North America, and then to return to their native land once they had become rich. However, only about twenty percent of the migrants returned to Finland. Those who did managed to import new ideas and technologies into Finland and put them into use there. Approximately ten thousand Finns returned from the New World, not to Finland but to the Soviet Union, in the 1920s and the 1930s to \\"build socialism\\" in the Karelian ASSR. This took place mainly for ideological reasons and was strongly supported by the political elite of the USSR. Demographic concentrations Bilingual street signs in English and Finnish in Hancock, Michigan, home of Finlandia University. Today, the greatest concentration of Finnish Americans is in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where they form 16% of the population, and are the largest ancestral group in the peninsula's western counties.Census-2000-Data- Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg Hancock, one cities of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, could be considered a kind of \\"cultural capital\\" of the Finnish Americans. Finland Calling, a weekly Finnish cultural television program hosted by Carl Pellonpaa, was broadcast on WLUC-TV in Michigan‚Äôs Upper Peninsula. In March 2015 the program's final episode aired, ending 53 years of weekly broadcasts. Stanton Township, Michigan, is the place in the U.S. with the largest proportion of people with Finnish ancestry, at 47%.U.S. census data as compiled by eopdunk.com Finnish American household income is $70,045. Notable people =John Morton= An early ethnic Finn notable in American history was John Morton, signer of the Declaration of Independence. The original name of the family was Marttinen, of which Morton is an anglicized version. The Marttinen/Morton family came originally from Rautalampi municipality in the region of Northern Savonia, a province of Eastern Finland. =Eero Saarinen= Architect and product designer Eero Saarinen emigrated to United States in 1923 when he was thirteen years of age and grew up in Michigan. His father was architect Eliel Saarinen, the first president of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He studied architecture at the Cranbrook Academy of Art and later the Yale University and graduated in 1934. After touring Europe and Africa for couple of years he returned to the States and became a citizen in 1940. During the Second World War Saarinen worked for Office of Strategic Services (OSS) which later became the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Saarinen is famous for his furniture and architectural designs. His designs include the Gateway Arch at the Gateway Arch National Park in St. Louis, Missouri, the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and the main terminal of Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C.. Eero's son, Eric Saarinen, is a cinematographer and film director, who has photographed and cinematographed several features, including The Hills Have Eyes, Lost in America, and Exploratorium. =Other notable individuals= Notable Americans of some Finnish descent also include several film stars such as actresses Anna Easteden, Christine Lahti, Marian Nixon, Maila Nurmi, and Jessica Lange, actors Albert Salmi, Matt Damon, Richard Davalos, Pamela Anderson and George Gaynes, and director David Lynch. Other notable individuals are author Jean M. Auel, historian Max Dimont (born in Finland of Russian Jewish parentage), politician Emil Hurja, labor activist T-Bone Slim, U.S. Communist Party leader Gus Hall (originally Arvo Kustaa Halberg), Finnish-Kiowa-Comanche US Attorney Arvo Mikkanen, mathematician Lars Ahlfors, musicians Dave Mustaine, Jaco Pastorius, Einar Aaron Swan Jorma Kaukonen and Mark Hoppus, singer-songwriter Amelia Presley, computer scientists Linus Torvalds and Alfred Aho, former Google executive and CEO of Yahoo Marissa Mayer, co-founder of Apple Mike Markkula, Chairman and CEO of General Motors Mary Barra, astronaut Timothy L. Kopra, special forces officer Larry Thorne, ice hockey player Matt Niskanen and serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Porn actress Puma Swede is of Finnish descent although she was born in Sweden. Culture FinnFest USA is an annual festival is held to celebrate Finnish heritage and culture in the United States. Organized by a non-profit organization of the same name, FinnFest USA has been held in a different location each year since 1983, often incorporating regional cultural elements of the local site into the year's event. To date there have also been three FinnGrandFests, a collaboration between Finnish-Americans and Finnish- Canadians: 2000 (Toronto, Ontario), 2005 (Marquette, Michigan) and 2010 (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario). Finnish American culture is also celebrated at Finlandia University in Hancock, Michigan, formerly Suomi College, which has been the only Finnish American institution of higher learning in the United States since the closing of Work People's College in Duluth, Minnesota in 1941. Finlandia was established by the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and is now affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Salolampi Finnish Language Village is a Finnish language immersion camp in Bemidji, Minnesota. Founded in 1978, it is a member of the Concordia Language Villages, and celebrates Finnish and Finnish-American heritage, culture, and language.

During his life, he served as Chancellor of the University of Kansas (KU) and Chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Biography = Early years = Murphy was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1916 where he attended the Pembroke- Country Day School. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kansas in 1936, and then earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1941. After graduation, he served in the United States Army during World War II. Afterward, he returned to Kansas City to practice cardiology, and began teaching at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in Kansas City, Kansas. =Career= Within a few years of beginning his professorship at the University of Kansas, he became dean of the medical school and eventually was chosen by the Kansas Board of Regents to be chancellor of the entire university. Because of his successes at KU, UCLA asked him to become their chancellor. In 1960, when his relationship with Kansas Governor George Docking was no longer tolerable, he accepted the position and relocated to Los Angeles, California. There, he was also appointed to be a professor of medical history. At UCLA, he dealt with the turbulence of student movements in the 1960s in a progressive manner, and successfully kept the university stable. Moreover, he worked to establish the university as a first-rate institution in its own right, and not simply a branch of the vast University of California system. He expanded the UCLA library system, enlarged the School of Medicine's basic science programs, convinced the regents of the University of California to purchase and maintain a cyclotron for the school, and founded the Jules Stein Eye Institute and a museum now known as the Fowler Museum at UCLA. In 1968, he resigned his position as chancellor in order to become Chairman and CEO of the Times Mirror Company, remaining in Los Angeles. He continued in this position until 1980, and remained a director of the company until he retired in 1986. =Personal life= After his retirement, he became a major philanthropist in Los Angeles for the rest of his life. He served on many philanthropic boards, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Los Angeles Music Center, raising funds and public awareness of the institutions. Murphy died in Los Angeles in 1994. Legacy The Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden at UCLA, which he founded, still remains a world-famous permanent sculpture exhibition; Murphy Hall, which houses UCLA administration and admissions, has also been named in his honor. At the University of Kansas, both Murphy Hall and the Murphy Art and Architecture Library are named in his honor.

He was also the longest-serving head of New York City's Tammany Hall, a position he served from 1902 to 1924. Murphy was responsible for transforming Tammany Hall's image from one of corruption to respectability as well as extending Tammany Hall's political influence to the national level. Known as a reticent politician and a first rate political chess master, Murphy would be responsible for the election of three mayors of New York City, three governors of New York State, and two US senators, even though he was never listed as a leader of Tammany Hall. Early life Murphy was the son of Irish immigrants Dennis Murphy and Mary Prendergrass, born in the Gashouse District, which got its name from its proximity to Consolidated Gas Company storage tanks. He was educated in the public and parochial schools but quit school at 14 and found a job at Roaches Shipyard and eventually as a streetcar driver for the Crosstown Blue Lines Horsecar Co. After saving $500 from the jobs that he had worked, Murphy purchased a saloon in 1878, which he named Charlie's Place. Charlie's Place became a local gathering place for local dock and Consolidated Gas Company workers but did not serve women because Murphy believed that most women who frequented bars were prostitutes. The second floor of the Saloon served as the Sylvan Social Club, composed of males aged 15 to 20.Allbray With the social club, Murphy formed a baseball team, and with all three groups, Murphy arose as a local political figure. Political career Murphy with William H. Fitzpatrick, the Erie County Democratic leader Murphy's friend and benefactor, Edward Hagan, failed to achieve the Tammany Hall nomination for district assemblyman in 1883, which led Hagan to attempt an independent campaign. Murphy managed Hagan's independent campaign, leading to Hagan's victory. Murphy was also prominent in Francis Spinola's successful campaign for US Congress in 1885. The same year, one of Murphy's saloons became the headquarters for the Anawanda Club, which was the local Tammany Hall club; eventually, Murphy joined Tammany Hall's Executive Committee. Murphy was appointed to be the Commissioner of Docks in 1897. During this period, he organized the New York Contracting and Trucking Company, which leased dock space. That became a successful business, mostly because of \\"honest graft\\" in business with the city, and Murphy gained further prominence in Tammany Hall. In 1902, Murphy married widower Margaret J. Graham; also that year, the Tammany Hall boss, Richard Croker, was forced out of office because of public accusations of corruption. The accusations of corruption included stealing from the municipal treasury, which never occurred. Murphy quickly replaced Croker as Boss of Tammany Hall. Murphy owned shares of the American Ice Company during the Ice Trust Scandal, but his reputation was not tarnished. In contrast to Croker, the taciturn and teetotaling Murphy brought an air of respectability to Tammany Hall. He furthered that end by promoting a new crop of Tammany politicians, such as Senator James J. Walker, Rockland County Chairman James Farley, and Alderman Alfred E. Smith, who would move the political machine away from the methods of Boss Tweed and toward a Progressive Era-style that rewarded the loyalty of the poor with reforms like factory safety and child labor laws. Although initially opposed to progressive legislation, Murphy realized that he could support reforms that pleased his constituency but which did not undermine Tammany's power.Lifflander, Matthew L. \\"The Tragedy That Changed New York\\" New York Archives (Summer 2011) Because of his stance, he is credited with transforming Tammany into a political organization capable of drawing the votes of the ever-growing numbers of new immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, which kept Tammany in power until the early 1930s. =New York Contracting and Trucking= Croker made money through \\"honest graft.\\" New York Contracting and Trucking was awarded a $6 million contract in 1904 to build rail lines in the Bronx for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. An executive at the railroad said the contract was awarded to avoid friction with Tammany Hall. In response to the contract, the New York State Legislature amended the city's charter so that franchise-awarding power was removed from the city board of aldermen and given to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which existed until 1989. By 1905, New York Contracting and Trucking had collected over $15 million in city contracts. =Louis N. Hartog business= While the United States was at war in 1918, Murphy was receiving income from a firm owned by the businessman Louis N. Hartog in exchange for Murphy's arranging the Corn Products Refining Company to sell Hartog's firm glucose. Hartog would then use the glucose to manufacture malt dextrine, an ingredient in beer. After investing $175,000 in Hartog's firm, Murphy was gaining $5,000 a day from the arrangement. In light of the ongoing war, the unfavorable light it would direct towards Tammany, and the amount of money Murphy received, which he considered too much, Murphy attempted to withdraw from the business. Hartog sued Murphy in response, but Murphy countersued and the case was settled. Political influence Murphy guided George B. McClellan, Jr to the position of city mayor in 1903 over incumbent Seth Low. McClellan was reluctant to reward Murphy patronage jobs, but Murphy went along with McClellan's decisions. In the 1905 mayoral election, Murphy again guided McClellan to victory, this time over William Randolph Hearst. It was notable since Hearst was then known for ties to the progressive movement and for his organization, the Municipal Ownership League, whose goal was the promotion of the public ownership of utilities and transit lines to bring about lower rates and fares. Hearst's newspapers also attacked McClellan's defense of privately-owned subways and Murphy's ties to the New York Contracting and Trucking company. After Hearst lost the mayoral election contest, Murphy would try to appease Hearst by appearing to back him for the governorship in 1906, which lost. In his second term, McClellan did not react kindly to Murphy's friendliness with Hearst, and during the city's $100 million drinking water infrastructure expansion into the Catskill Mountains, McClellan did not allow Tammany access to the newly-created jobs. For the 1909 city mayoral election, Murphy backed New York State Supreme Court Justice William Jay Gaynor. By supporting Gaynor, Murphy tried to unite the Democrats in Manhattan under Tammany with the Democrats in Brooklyn under Patrick McCarren. As for uniting with the city's other burroughs, the Bronx was under the control of Murphy's friend Louis Haffen, and Queens and Staten Island did not have large populations. Gaynor won the election against Hearst and, like McClellan, did not act kindly towards Murphy's Tammany. Gaynor cut the city's payroll and eliminated 400 political posts within the first few months of office. Nine months into his term, a disgruntled Docks Department employee attempted to assassinate Gaynor, who was traveling on an oceanic steamship. Murphy successfully guided John Alden Dix to the governorship in 1910. To beat Theodore Roosevelt's candidate in 1912, Oscar S. Straus, whom Murphy expected to garner many of the Jewish votes that normally would have gone to Tammany candidates, Murphy backed US Representative William Sulzer, a Tammany politician in a heavily-Jewish district. Sulzer would win the election, but Murphy would later regret his decision after the vain Sulzer started to launch investigations against Tammany contractors. Sulzer also resisted Murphy's choice for patronage positions. Sulzer would become the subject of a different investigation and, after failing to testify, gained the distinction of becoming the only governor in New York State to be successfully impeached. Murphy would make his boldest move yet in 1912 in striking a secret deal to swing the Democratic Party'sconvention in Baltimore to the New Jersey Governor Woodrow, Wilson. \\"Five long days of deadlock, and forty-two ballots, had failed to give either of the two leading candidates, Wilson and Champ Clark, the two-thirds majority each needed to win the nomination. Then, on the forty- third ballot, Illinois moved, casting all fifty-eight of her votes for Wilson. The third-place candidate, Oscar Underwood, released his delegates, as did Champ Clark. The roll call for the forty-sixth ballot got underway as mid- afternoon approached. Charles F. Murphy stood to announce that his state, the largest in the Union, had changed sides: 'New York casts 90 votes for Woodrow Wilson,' he said, and got the biggest cheer of the roll call. On Champ Clark‚Äôs suggestion, the convention acclaimed Woodrow Wilson unanimously.\\"[http://239days.com/2012/07/03/the-man-who-would-be-president/ Retrieved on 2020-04-22. Following the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire on March 25, 1911, attention focused on the factories' working conditions. With the assistance of his prot√©g√©s Robert F. Wagner and Alfred E. Smith, 1913 became a significant year for Tammany Hall in the promotion of progressive reforms. In the city, workplace health regulations were improved, fire alarms were mandated, working hours were reduced for women, a pension system for widowers was introduced, and requirements for insurance were made stricter. At the state level, a referendum on women's suffrage was scheduled and the Public Utility Commission was provided broader powers. In Democratic Party circles, 1914 was a big year since Murphy supported a direct primary system for nomination to all state offices. Murphy did not want to entertain the idea of Hearst as the Democratic mayor in 1917, but to avoid appearing as being against Hearst's nomination, Murphy approached the Brooklyn Democratic machine's John F. Hylan, who was also a friend of Hearst, to see if Hylan would run. The Brooklyn Democratic Boss, John McCooey, according to a story, made a show of forcing Hylan on Murphy as the Democratic nominee that Murphy reluctantly accepted. Hearst withdrew from the race, and the Democrats won the mayoral election. Murphy guided Smith to victory in the 1918 governor's election. Murphy was a delegate at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, and it was in part by his influence that James M. Cox secured the nomination. During his reign, Murphy brought Tammany Hall's political influence to the national level. In 1924, he and the Democratic Party were expected to nominate Smith for president (before his death, Murphy served as the manager of Smith's campaign effort). Murphy also influenced the elections of three New York City mayors, three New York State governors, and the impeachment of Governor William Sulzer. Governor Sulzer was propelled into office by Tammany Hall, but during his tenure, Sulzer distanced himself from Tammany politics, refused to follow its orders, and supported general primaries.Lifflander, Matthew L. The Impeachment of Governor Sulzer: A Story of American Politics. Albany: State University of New York, 2012. Print. That angered both Tammany Hall and its boss, Murphy; with his help, the State Assembly voted to impeach Sulzer on counts of perjury and fraud. Murphy's involvement in the impeachment of a former Tammany member demonstrates his tenacity and fierceness as a political figure. Murphy once said, \\"It is the fate of political leaders to be reviled. If one is too thin skinned to stand it he should never take the job. History shows the better and more successful the organization and the leader the more bitter the attacks.\\" Edward J. Flynn, a prot√©g√© of Murphy who became the boss in the Bronx, said Murphy always advised that politicians should have nothing to do with gambling or prostitution and steer clear of involvement with the police department or the school system.Terry Golway, Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics (2014) p 186 Death Murphy died suddenly of what the New York Times termed \\"acute indigestion,\\" which affected his heart, on April 25, 1924, at his home in New York City. A Roman Catholic, he was given a funeral service at St. Patrick's Cathedral and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in New York.\\"Chief is Stricken Suddenly; Arises in Pain, Sends for Doctor and Expires a Few Minutes Later\\"; The New York Times, April 26, 1924 In popular culture Murphy caricatured in William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal (November 10, 1905) In the 1941 film Citizen Kane, screenwriters Herman J.

Hearst was denied the election by a slim margin due to electoral fraud perpetrated by Murphy's organization, and his newspapers retaliated. A historic cartoon of Murphy in convict stripes appeared November 10, 1905, three days after the vote.Turner, Hy B., When Giants Ruled: The Story of Park Row, New York's Great Newspaper Street.

Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 80; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983  Early career  His articles in the daily press attracted attention by their energetic opposition to the Conservative government of Jos√© Ignacio de M√°rquez from 1837 to 1840. After the revolution of the latter year he became editor of the Gaceta Mercantil de Santa Marta, which exercised a great influence, and paved the way for the triumph of the Partido Liberal Colombiano in the elections of 1849. He was elected to the chamber of representatives, and soon attained a reputation for eloquence. He was called to serve as Secretary of State and then Secretary of the Treasury and during the administration of President Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez. As Secretary of the Treasury, he established liberty of industry and the decentralization of the provincial revenues, and thus prepared the way for the future federal institutions. At the same time, he defended the administration in the press, and initiated the greater part of the progressive reforms that were established by it, such as the abolition of slavery, abolition of the death penalty for political crimes and abolition of several fiscal monopolies. He advocated liberty of the press, and the reform of the civil code. In 1852 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the vice presidency of the republic. When the Liberal party lost power he returned to journalism, and, except during the short time that he was state executive for Santander, he sustained an energetic opposition to the Conservative government. When President Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez was overthrown, and the federation proclaimed by the constituent convention of Rio Negro, 4 February 1863, Murillo was appointed minister to Europe, and afterward to the United States.  First Presidency  Murillo ran for President of Colombia in the general election of 1864 representing the Partido Liberal Colombiano. The Colombian Conservative Party abstained from participating in this election. Murillo had two other liberal opponents, Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera and Santos Guti√©rrez. Murillo won the election and was elected president for the 1864-1866 presidential term. During his administration, noted for its conciliatory spirit, the first telegraph lines were established. After his term as president was over, he was elected to the federal senate. For his opposition to some arbitrary measures of President Mosquera he was arrested with others, by order of Mosquera, when the congress was dissolved in March 1867. After the deposition of Mosquera, 25 May 1867, Murillo was a member of the legislature of Cundinamarca, and afterward for a short time again minister to the United States and judge of the supreme court. In all these posts, he was notable for his consistent adherence to the doctrines that he had proclaimed as a journalist and legislator.  Second Presidency  Murillo ran a second time for President of Colombia in the general election of 1872, representing the Colombian Liberal Party. He was aided in part by the Conservative party. Murillo had two other opponents, Manuel Mallarino and Juli√°n Trujillo Largacha. Murillo won the election and was elected president for the 1872-1874 presidential term. In winning this election, Murillo became the first civilian to be elected President of Colombia for a second time.  Later career  His successor to the Presidency, Santiago P√©rez de Manosalbas, although belonging to the opposite party, sent him as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Venezuela to arrange the pending question of boundaries according to the proposal of Guzman Blanco. As Murillo controverted with great ability on all the points that were brought up by the Venezuelan commissioner, no treaty could be agreed on. Murillo was again elected senator in 1878, and occupied his seat in the next session of congress, but sickness prevented him from attending in 1880, and he died in the same year.  Mayor accomplishments  Murillo sponsored, supported and enacted legislation to bring into law the rights of freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press. He also established the National Press and Telegraph Institute and the National Cartography Institute.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos, trans.

In April and May 2011, Williams walked to the North Pole and achieved the summit of Mount Everest.  Education  Williams was educated at Monkton Combe School, Bath, where he began rowing aged 13. He attended Oxford Brookes University where he studied History and Town planning.  International career  Williams made his full international debut in 1998 at the age of 22. He partnered Fred Scarlett in the coxless pair, and came a creditable sixth in his first world championships. A year later he partnered Simon Dennis in the same event, this time finishing fifth. In 2000 both Scarlett and Dennis won seats in the GB Eight for the Olympics in Sydney but Williams just missed out, and instead was a member of the Coxed Four which won a gold medal at the World Championships in Zagreb for non-Olympic events. In 2001 he was again world champion, this time in the Coxless Four, and won the silver medal in the same discipline in both 2002 and 2003. With Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Ed Coode, Williams won Olympic gold at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens in the men's coxless four. Williams was the only member of the 2004 Olympic crew to continue racing in the 2005 season, joining Alex Partridge, Pete Reed and Andrew Triggs Hodge in the coxless four, again winning the World Championship that year and in 2006, before coming a disappointing fourth at the 2007 world championships. In 2008, Partridge was replaced in the four by Cambridge Blue Tom James, and - despite an injury-torn season - the quartet became Olympic Champions, defeating the Australian boat by 1.28s on the day dubbed 'Super Saturday' by the media owing to the large GB medal haul. The Australians led for much of the race before an epic push by the British boat overhauled them in the last 400 m.  Current occupation  Williams was appointed as a fitness consultant to Andy Liddell for Ipswich Town Football Club on 3 July 2012. Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Williams was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. On 22 January 2010 he announced his retirement from rowing. He has been welcomed back to Monkton Combe School on several occasions, rowing in a Monkton Bluefriars old boys' boat at a school regatta.

Murad Bey Mohammed ( 1750 ‚Äì 22 April 1801) was an Egyptian Mamluk chieftain (Bey), cavalry commander and joint ruler of Egypt with Ibrahim Bey. He is often remembered as being a cruel and extortionate ruler, but an energetic courageous fighter. Biography While many Georgian historians claim Murad was of Georgian origin and born in Tiflis,Mikaberidze, Alexander, \\"Murad Bey\\", in: Gregory Fremont-Barnes (ed., 2006), The Encyclopedia of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, Vol. 2, p. 663.

Christopher Herold: Bonaparte in Egypt, pages 70 and 252. New York 1962/2009 In 1768 he was sold to the (Circassian) Mamluk Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab in Egypt. After the death of his master Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab, Murad Bey was in command of the Mamluk army, whereas Ibrahim Bey was in charge of administrative duties of Egypt. They survived through the persistent Ottoman attempts at overthrowing the Mamluk regime and civil strifes. They served as kaymakams (acting governors) in Egypt on occasion, although they effectively held de facto power for decades, even over the appointed Ottoman governor of Egypt. In 1786, the Ottoman sultan Abd√ºlhamid I sent Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral of the Ottoman Navy) Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha to drive out Ibrahim and Murad Bey. Hasan Pasha was fervent and thorough in his efforts and succeeded in the short term, reestablishing direct Ottoman Empire control over Egypt. Ismail Bey was appointed as new Mamluk leader and Shaykh al-Balad (civil governor and de facto ruler). However, in 1791, only five years after their expulsion by Hasan Pasha, the duumvirate returned to Cairo from hiding in southern Egypt and took back de facto control. At this time, Murad Bey served as Amir al-Hajj (Commander of the Hajj). He commanded the Mamluk cavalry and Janissaries' infantry in the Battle of Shubra Khit on 13 July 1798, but he was defeated by the French Arm√©e and withdrew from the fight. Eight days later, on 21 July, he commanded the Mamluk cavalry during the Battle of the Pyramids, alongside Ibrahim Bey, and was defeated at the hands of Napoleon's armies. While Ibrahim Bey fled towards Sinai, Murad had fled to Cairo first and then to Upper Egypt and began mounting a brief guerrilla campaign that staved off Desaix for a year. It was while pursuing Murad Bey into Upper Egypt that the French discovered the monuments at Dendera, Thebes, Edfu and Philae. Murad had reportedly offered money to the French forces to leave Egypt and offered to ally himself with the British in exchange for allowing the British to occupy Alexandria, Damietta and Rosetta. In 1800, Murad made peace with Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber, and agreed to garrison Cairo, but died of bubonic plague on his journey there.

Life and career He was born in Olten, and studied science and history at the University of Bern, then later took courses in Oriental studies at Munich University and the Sorbonne. He was the son of Josef Munzinger, member of the Swiss Federal Council. In 1852 Munzinger arrived at Cairo, where he spent a year improving his Arabic. Entering a French mercantile house, he led a trading expedition to various parts of the Red Sea. Until 1855 he served as French consul at Massawa, when he moved to Keren where he spent the next six years exploring the lands of the Bogos. In 1861 Munzinger joined Theodor von Heuglin in an attempt to explore central Africa, but separated from him in November, proceeding along the Gash and Atbara to Khartoum. There he succeeded von Heuglin as leader of the expedition, and travelled in 1862 to Kordofan, but failed to reach Darfur and Wadai. After a short stay in Europe in 1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east borderlands of Ethiopia. In 1865 Munzinger managed the British consulate along the border of Ethiopia, but remained in Massawa, after the 1868 British invasion of Ethiopia, where he became the French consul. There, according to Augustus B. Wylde, he married a woman of Hamasien and convinced one of the local warlords, Wolde Mikael, to cede the province of Hamasien to France. Munzinger sailed to France, and by early 1870 had an expedition ready at Toulon to sail to Massawa when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French resources were diverted to this higher priority, whereupon he left the service of the French.Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), pp. 21ff In July of that year he was sent to Aden, where he joined Captain S.B.

Werner Munzinger, \\"Account of an Excursion into the Interior of Southern Arabia\\", Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, 41 (1871), pp. 210-245 He then left the French and entered the service of the Egyptian government of Khedive Ismail, serving as governor of the Keren region and Massawa (modern-day Eritrea). Once he reached his command, his first act was to place the Bogos once again under Egyptian rule. In 1875, Munzinger led one of the three prongs of the Egyptian attack against Ethiopia, marching inland from Tadjoura, but his troops were overwhelmed by the army of Mahammad ibn Hanfadhe, Sultan of Aussa, and he was killed in battle.Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 90. .

He was one of the pioneers in applied psychology, extending his research and theories to industrial/organizational (I/O), legal, medical, clinical, educational and business settings. M√ºnsterberg encountered immense turmoil with the outbreak of the First World War. Torn between his loyalty to the United States and his homeland, he often defended Germany's actions, attracting highly contrasting reactions. Biography =Early life= Hugo M√ºnsterberg was born into a merchant family in Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland), then a port city in West Prussia.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif u.a.: Wadsworth (347) Even if he was later known for his German nationalism, Hugo's family was actually Jewish,Sander Gilman, Multiculturalism and the Jews, Routledge (2013), p. 73 a heritage with which he felt no connection and would barely ever manifest publicly.Andrew R. Heinze, Jews and the American Soul: Human Nature in the Twentieth Century, Princeton University Press (2004), p. 109 His father Moritz (1825‚Äì1880), was a successful lumber merchant and his mother, Minna Anna Bernhardi (1838‚Äì1875), a recognized artist and musician, was Moritz's second wife. Moritz had two sons with his first wife, Otto (1854‚Äì1915) and Emil (1855‚Äì1915), and two with Anna, Hugo (1863‚Äì1916) and Oscar (1865‚Äì1920). The four sons remained close, and all of them became successful in their careers. A neo-Renaissance villa in Detmold, Germany, that Oscar lived in from 1886-1896 has recently been renovated and opened as a cultural center. The family had a great love of the arts, and M√ºnsterberg was encouraged to explore music, literature, and art. Both his mother and his father died before he was 20 years old. When he was 12, his mother died, which marked a major change in the young boy's life, transforming him from a care-free child to a much more serious young man. In 1880, his father also died. =Education and career= Cover of Psychotherapy by M√ºnsterberg M√ºnsterberg had many interests in his early years and displayed interests in many fields including art, literature, poetry, foreign languages, music, and acting. M√ºnsterberg's first years of school were spent at the Gymnasium of Danzig from which he graduated in 1882 with Oliver and Dennis. He entered the University of Leipzig in 1883 where he heard a lecture by Wilhelm Wundt and became interested in psychology. M√ºnsterberg eventually became Wundt's research assistant. He received his Ph.D. in physiological psychology in 1885 under Wundt's supervision at the age of 22. Possibly following Wundt's advice M√ºnsterberg decided to study medicine and in 1887 received his medical degree at the University of Heidelberg. He also passed an examination that enabled him to lecture as a privatdocent at University of Freiburg. While at Freiburg he started a psychology laboratory and began publishing papers on a number of topics including attentional processes, memory, learning, and perception. In the same year he married a distant cousin, Selma Oppler of Strassburg, on August 7. In 1889, he was promoted to assistant professorship and attended the First International Congress of psychology where he met William James. They kept up a frequent correspondence and in 1892, James invited him to Harvard for a three-year term as a chair of the psychology lab even though M√ºnsterberg did not speak English at the time. He learned to speak English rather quickly and as a result his classes became very popular with students, in fact he was attracting students from James's classes. Part of the responsibilities he assumed as part of his new position at Harvard was that he became the supervisor of the psychology graduate students, in this position directed their dissertation research. As a result, he had a great influence of many students including Mary Whiton Calkins.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (350). In 1895 he returned to Freiburg due to uncertainties of settling in the United States. However, because he could not obtain an academic position that he wanted, he wrote James and requested his old position back so that he could return to Harvard, which he did in 1897.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (350). However, he never could separate himself from his homeland. Hugo M√ºnsterberg. While at Harvard, M√ºnsterberg's career was going very well. He was affiliated with many organizations including the American Psychological Association of which he became president (1898), the American Philosophical Association of which he also became president (1908), the Washington Academy, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (348). He was the organizer and vice- president of the International Congress of Arts and Sciences at the Saint Louis World's Fair of 1904, vice-president of the International Psychological Congress in Paris in 1900, and vice-president of the International Philosophical Congress at Heidelberg in 1907. In 1910-1911, he was appointed exchange professor from Harvard to the University of Berlin. During that year, he founded the Amerika-Institut in Berlin.See Berliner Amerika-Institut on German wikipedia for more on the Amerika-Institut in Berlin. During his whole stay in the United States, he worked for the improvement of the relations between the United States and Germany, writing in the United States for a better understanding of Germany and in Germany for a higher appreciation of the United States. Because of his work in applied psychology, M√ºnsterberg was well known to the public, academic world, and scientific community.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (349). The outspoken views of M√ºnsterberg on the issues of the upcoming First World War raised storms of controversy about his ideals and position. He appeared as probably the most eminent supporter of German policies in the United States and so was at the utmost bitterly condemned by the Triple Entente and their friends, but to the pro-Germans, he appeared almost an idol. While supporting German policies, M√ºnsterberg denounced many of the activities of the Teutonic hyphenates in the United States. Fearing a patriotic response to overt support of the German Empire would undermine his own more covert approach, he condemned the forming of an alien party within the United States as \\"a crime against the spirit of true Americanism\\" and said that its results would reach far beyond the time of the war. At his death, the general attitude toward M√ºnsterberg had changed, and his death went relatively unnoticed because of his pro-German attitudes and his support of German policies. He tried to talk about the inaccurate stereotypes held by both the Germans and Americans. He wrote many books and articles attempting to correct them including The Americans (1904). In American Problems (1910), however, he was highly critical of Americans and said that they had the \\"general inability to concentrate their attention on any one thing for very long.\\"Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (350). As the war approached, M√ºnsterberg's support of the supposed efficiency and modernity of the German autocracy caused him to be suspected of being a German spy, and many of his more liberal Harvard colleagues disassociated themselves from him. There were also threats against his life. He remained at Harvard as a professor of experimental psychology and director of the Psychological Laboratory until his sudden death, possibly by stress, in 1916 while he was on a lecture platform. Scholarship =Comparisons to Wundt and James= One major point of disagreement between Wundt and M√ºnsterberg was their opposing views on how psychology should be practiced. For Wundt psychology should be a pure science detached from practical concerns, while M√ºnsterberg wanted to apply psychological principles that could be applied to practical concerns.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (647). While working as Wundt's research assistant M√ºnsterberg was studying voluntary activities through introspection, however, they disagreed on the fundamental principles. Wundt believed that free will could be experienced as a conscious element of the mind during introspection, while M√ºnsterberg did not.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif [u.a.: Wadsworth (347). M√ºnsterberg believed that as we prepare to act we consciously experience this bodily preparedness and mistakenly interpret it with the will to act a certain way. M√ºnsterberg's beliefs support his interpretation of James's ideo-motor theory of behavior. For M√ºnsterberg behavior causes ideas. However, for James ideas cause behavior.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif [u.a.: Wadsworth (347). There are also similarities between James's theory of emotion and M√ºnsterberg's analysis of voluntary behavior. For the James-Lange theory of emotion, \\"emotions are by-products of bodily reactions elicited by a situation.\\" Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif [u.a.: Wadsworth (348). Whereas for M√ºnsterberg \\"the feeling of willful actions results from an awareness of covert behavior, or a readiness to act overtly, elicited by a situation.\\" Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif [u.a.: Wadsworth (348). In both cases, conscious experience is the result of behavior. In 1900 he published the Basics of Psychology which he dedicated to James. Later M√ºnsterberg became unhappy with James's liberal attitude towards philosophy and psychology. He was unhappy about James's acceptance of Freudian psychoanalysis, psychic phenomena, and religious mysticism into the area of psychology.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif [u.a.: Wadsworth (348). M√ºnsterberg had said \\"Mysticism and mediums were one thing, psychology was quite another. Experimental psychology and psychic hocus-pocus did not mix.\\" Bjork, D. W. (1983). The compromised scientist: William James in the development of American psychology. New York: Columbia University Press (63-64). =Applied psychology= Over time M√ºnsterberg's interests turned to the many practical applications of psychological principles, he felt very strongly that psychologists had the responsibility to uncover information that could then be used in real world applications. In fact he was the first to apply psychological principles to the legal field, creating forensic psychology.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (349). He wrote several papers on the application of psychological information in legal situations. The main objective in most of these articles was eyewitness testimony which examined the viability of said witness testimony. He also applied psychological principles to the field of clinical psychology attempting to help those who are ill through a variety of different treatments. =Forensic psychology= In 1908, M√ºnsterberg published his controversial book On the Witness Stand (1908), which is a collection of magazine articles previously published by him where he discusses the many different psychological factors that can change a trial's outcome and pointed the way for rational and scientific means for probing the facts claimed by human witnesses by the application of experimental psychology to the administration of law. He is also credited with being among the first to consider jury research. He says \\"The lawyer alone is obdurate. The lawyer and the judge and the juryman are sure that they do not need the experimental psychologist... They go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed and somewhat more... Just in the line of the law it therefore seems necessary not to rely simply on the technical statements of scholarly treatises, but to carry the discussion in the most popular form possible before the wider tribunal of the general reader\\" cementing his position that while the lawyer, judge, and the jurymen are confident in their abilities, that with the use of experimental psychology he can show just how flawed their thinking can really be.Green, Christopher. \\"On the Witness Stand: Essays on Psychology and Crime.\\" Classics in the History of Psychology. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 July 2011. M√ºnsterberg points out the various reasons why eyewitness testimony is inherently unreliable. He describes how eyewitness testimony is inherently susceptible to what he calls \\"illusions\\" where a subject's perceptions could be affected by the circumstances, making their memory of the events that transpired or testimony inaccurate. He states that with regularity the testimony between two different individuals in the same circumstances can be radically different, even when neither of whom had the slightest interest in changing the facts as remembered.M√ºnsterberg, H. (1909). On the witness stand: Essays on psychology and crime. New York: Doubleday, Page (24‚Äì25). M√ºnsterberg believes this is because memory, when all things are equal, is easily fallible. Because one's memory is affected by the associations, judgments, and suggestions that penetrate into every one of one's observations and taint our memory and our recollection of events. Less well known but highly prescient, M√ºnsterberg wrote about \\"Untrue Confessions.\\" Appreciating the intuitive credibility of confession evidence in court, he expressed concern that confessions were fallible and speculated as to the psychological causes of false confessions. M√ºnsterberg conducted many experiments with his normal psychology students in his basic psychology course while at Harvard. He asked them, \\"without any theoretical introduction, at the beginning of an ordinary lecture, to write down careful answers to a number of questions referring to that which they would see or hear\\", and urged them \\"to do it as conscientiously and carefully as possible.\\" The procedure went as follows. First he would show them a large sheet of white cardboard with a certain number of black dots on it spread in an irregular order. He exposed it for the students to view for only five seconds, and then asked them how many black dots that they thought were on the sheet. The results were surprising in that even with \\"highly trained, careful observers, whose attention was concentrated on the material, and who had full time for quiet scrutiny... there were some who believed that they saw seven or eight times more points than some other saw.\\" He conducted similar experiments that referred to the perception of time, how rapidity is estimated, descriptions of sounds, and other similar experiments with similar results. Based on the results of his experiments, he \\"warned against the blind confidence in the observations of the average normal man\\" and concluded that one cannot rely on the accuracy of a normal person's memory.M√ºnsterberg, H. (1909). On the witness stand: Essays on psychology and crime. New York: Doubleday, Page (24-25). He questioned how one could be sure of the testimony of any given witness. In a portion of the book which he calls \\"The Detection of Crime\\" he discusses the many factors that can influence testimony, gain confessions, and force a confession from those who are innocent.M√ºnsterberg, H. (1909). On the witness stand: Essays on psychology and crime. New York: Doubleday, Page (73). M√ºnsterberg states that \\"brutality is still a favorite method of undermining the mental resistance of the accused.\\"[5] (74) He discusses some of the ways that police of the time have of making suspects confess to crimes that they had not committed, including making the prisoner's life as uncomfortable as possible, to break down his or her energy, and \\"worst of all giving brutal shocks given with fiendish cruelty to the terrified imagination of the suspect.\\"M√ºnsterberg, H. (1909). On the witness stand: Essays on psychology and crime. New York: Doubleday, Page (74). He states \\"that the method is ineffective in bringing out the real truth. At all times, innocent men have been accused by the tortured ones, crimes which were never committed have been confessed, infamous lies have been invented, to satisfy the demands of the torturers.\\"M√ºnsterberg, H. (1909). On the witness stand: Essays on psychology and crime. New York: Doubleday, Page (74-75). For years his groundbreaking work was not given the recognition it deserved in Forensic Psychology and other fields but more recent scholarship highlights his substantial contribution to these fields.Dalby, J.T. (2014) Forensic psychology in Canada a century after M√ºnsterberg. Canadian Psychology, 55, 27-33 =Clinical psychology= M√ºnsterberg was grounded on the theory of psychophysical parallelism which argued that all physical processes had a parallel brain process. He believed that certain mental (neurological) illnesses have a cellular-metabolic causation and diagnosed based on his behavioristic observations of the subject's reactions to interviews of them by him. Psychotherapy (1909), the book he authored in regard to his investigations of matters of the mind. He defined psychotherapy as \\"the practice of treating the sick by influencing the mental life... perhaps with drugs and medicines, or with electricity or baths or diet.\\" M√ºnsterberg, H. (1909). Psychotherapy, by Hugo M√ºnsterberg. London: T. F. Unwin When trying to understand the causes of abnormal behavior, he saw many mentally ill people. Because he was seeing them for scientific reasons, he chose not to charge them for his services and attempted to understand the causes of abnormal behavior. His treatment, which he applied mainly to cases of alcoholism, drug addiction, phobia, and sexual dysfunction, was basically instilling in his patients the idea that they could expect to improve as a result of their efforts. He also employed reciprocal antagonism which is when you strengthen thoughts opposite of the behavior that is causing the problems. M√ºnsterberg did not believe that psychosis could be treated because he believed that was caused by deterioration of the nervous system.Hergenhahn, B. R. (2000). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth (349). =Industrial psychology= M√ºnsterberg was an admirer of Frederick Winslow Taylor to whom he wrote to in 1913: \\"Our aim is to sketch the outlines of a new science, which is to intermediate between the modern laboratory psychology and the problem of economics.\\" Industrial psychology was to be \\"independent of economic opinions and debatable... interests.\\"Industrial Psychology in Britain M√ºnsterberg's works Vocation and Learning (1912) and Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (1913) are usually considered the beginning of what would later become known as industrial psychology. His books dealt with many topics including hiring workers who had personalities and mental abilities best suited to certain types of vocations as the best way to increase motivation, performance, and retention, methods of increasing work efficiency, and marketing and advertising techniques. [1] (349) His paper Psychology and the Market (1909) suggested that psychology could be used in many different industrial applications including management, vocational decisions, advertising, job performance and employee motivation. In Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (1913) M√ºnsterberg addressed many different topics that are very important to the current field of industrial psychology. His objective was \\"to sketch the outlines of a new science which is to intermediate between the modern laboratory psychology and the problems of economics: the psychological experiment is systematically to be placed at the service of commerce and industry.\\" M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (3). He selects three points of view that he believes are of particular importance to industrial psychology and seeks to answer those questions. These three questions include \\"how we can find the men whose mental qualities make them best fitted for the work which they have to do; secondly, under what psychological conditions we can secure the greatest and most satisfactory output of work from every man; and finally, how we can produce most completely the influences on human minds which are desired in the interest of business.\\" In other words, we ask how to find \\"the best possible man, how to produce the best possible work, and how to secure the best possible effects.\\" M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (23‚Äì24). Hugo M√ºnsterberg. To M√ºnsterberg the most pressing question was the \\"selection of those personalities which by their mental qualities are especially fit for a particular kind of economic work.\\" M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (27). Basically fitting the person with the correct skill set with the correct position to maximize their productivity, and to select those that have \\"fit personalities and reject the unfit ones.\\" M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (29). He gives many reasons why it's difficult to select or place the correct person to any given vocation and says that certain qualities cannot be taken alone to determine a person's suitability for a position including their education, training, technical abilities, recommendation of previous employers, personal impressions of the person \\"the mental dispositions which may still be quite undeveloped and which may unfold only under the influence of special conditions in the surroundings; but, on the other side, it covers the habitual traits of the personality, the features of the individual temperament and character, of the intelligence and of the ability, of the collected knowledge and of the acquired experience. All variations of will and feeling, of perception and thought, of attention and emotion, of memory and imagination.\\"M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (28). That in reality having confidence in those prior factors is completely unfounded because he believes that \\"A threefold difficulty exists. In the first place, young people know very little about themselves and their abilities. When the day comes on which they discover their real strong points and their weaknesses, it is often too late. They have usually been drawn into the current of a particular vocation, and have given too much energy to the preparation for a specific achievement to change the whole life-plan once more. The entire scheme of education gives to the individual little chance to find himself. A mere interest for one or another subject in school is influenced by many accidental circumstances, by the personality of the teacher or the methods of instruction, by suggestions of the surroundings and by home traditions, and accordingly even such a preference gives rather a slight final indication of the individual mental qualities. Moreover, such mere inclinations and interests cannot determine the true psychological fitness for a vocation.\\"M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (30). M√ºnsterberg points out that wandering from one job to another is more common in America and notes that this does have certain advantages including \\"that a failure in one vocation does not bring with it such a serious injury as in Europe, but it contributes much to the greater danger that any one may jump recklessly and without preparation into any vocational stream.\\"M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (37). Therefore, he sought to find a psychologically scientific way of vocational guidance. He describes how two such systems have come to rise in America that attempt to guide young students as they leave school to their chosen vocation, and a newer system marked by a movement toward scientific management in commerce and industry. This second newer system started in Boston and is essentially a form of career guidance for children. A member of the community would call a meeting of all the neighborhood boys who were to leave elementary school at the end of the year and discuss with them whether they had any reasonable plans for the future. It was clear that the boys knew little of what they wanted to do or what would be expected of them in the real world, and the leader was able to give them, especially in one- one-one conversations, valuable advice. They knew too little of the characteristic features of the vocations to which they wanted to devote themselves, and they had given hardly any attention to the question whether they had the necessary qualifications for the special work.M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (39). From this experience an office \\"opened in 1908, in which all Boston children at the time when they left school were to receive individual suggestions with reference to the most reasonable and best adjusted selection of a calling. There is hardly any doubt that the remarkable success of this modest beginning was dependent upon the admirable personality of the late organizer, who recognized the individual features with unusual tact and acumen. But he himself had no doubt that such a merely impressionistic method could not satisfy the demands.\\"M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (40). M√ºnsterberg identified three main reasons why this worked: first, because they analyzed the objective relations of the hundreds of different accessible vocations, as well as, the children's economic, hygienic, technical, and social elements that should be examined so that every child could receive valuable information as to the demands of the vocation and what opportunities could be found within that vocation. Second, that the schools would have to be interested in the question of vocational choice so that observations of an individual child could be made about their abilities and interests. And finally, what he believed to be the most important point, \\"the methods had to be elaborated in such a way that the personal traits and dispositions might be discovered with much greater exactitude and with much richer detail than was possible through what a mere call on the vocational counselor could unveil.\\"M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (40‚Äì41). M√ºnsterberg believes that these early vocational counselors point towards the spirit of the modern tendency toward applied psychology, and that the goal can only be reached through exact, scientific, experimental research, \\"and that the mere na√Øve methods -- for instance, the filling-out of questionnaires which may be quite useful in the first approach -- cannot be sufficient for a real, persistent furtherance of economic life and of the masses who seek their vocations.\\"M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (43). The question of selecting the best possible man for a particular vocation for M√ºnsterberg comes down to making the process very scientific, trying to create tests that limit the subjectivity that is possible through more traditional techniques of introspection, and instead using measurements of one's personality, intelligence and other inherent personality traits to try to find the best possible job for every individual.M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print. M√ºnsterberg also explored under what psychological conditions that an employer can secure the most and highest quality output of work from every employee by looking at the effects of changing the work space environment, what can possibly effect workers production, problems of monotony in factory and other vocations that involve tedious repeated tasks and how to avoid these situation, studied attention and fatigue in the workplace, and the Physical and social influences on the working power.M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print. Finally investigating how a company can secure the best possible effects in terms of sales. M√ºnsterberg talks about ways to study the satisfaction of economic demands, experiments with discovering the effectiveness of advertisements, the psychology of buying and selling, and in the end discusses the future development of economic psychology.M√ºnsterberg, Hugo. Psychology and Industrial Efficiency. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913. Print (23‚Äì24). Women and education M√ºnsterberg's views on women have been frequently criticized, in the modern period. Though he firmly believed that women should receive where possible, a higher education, he felt that graduate studies were too difficult and demanding for them. As well as suggesting that women should not be allowed to serve on juries because they were \\"... incapable of rational deliberation.\\" Contributions to film theory Both Dudley Andrew and James Monaco count M√ºnsterberg's book The Photoplay: A Psychological Study as one of the early examples of film theory. Spiritualism Though he believed in God and life after death, M√ºnsterberg was throughout his career a committed opponent of parapsychology: the field of study concerned with the investigation of paranormal and psychic phenomena. He had a \\"great record of exposing mediums and other psychic charlatans\\".Gardner, Martin. (2001). Dis Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience. W. W. Norton & Company. p. 217. A notable episode in this facet of his career involved his exposure of the fraudulent spiritualist medium Eusapia Palladino. The exposure was included in the chapter \\"My Friends, the Spiritualists\\" in his book American Problems from the Point of View of a Psychologist (1910).M√ºnsterberg. Hugo. (1910). American Problems from the Point of View of a Psychologist. New York: Moffat, Yard and Company. pp. 117-150 Author Daniel Cohen noted that \\"[Palladino] was undaunted by M√ºnsterberg's exposure. Her tricks had been exposed many times before, yet she had prospered.\\"Daniel Cohen. (1972). In Search of Ghosts. Dodd, Mead & Company. p. 109. The exposure was not taken seriously by Palladino's defenders.Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. (1923). Phenomena of Materialisation.

On 18 December 1909, in New York, with the help of a hidden man lying under a table, M√ºnsterberg caught Palladino levitating a table with her foot.C. E. M. Hansel. (1980). ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation. Prometheus Books. pp. 58-64. Some investigators were originally baffled how Palladino could move curtains from a distance when all the doors and windows in the s√©ance room were closed. According to M√ºnsterberg she moved the curtains by releasing a jet of air from a rubber bulb that she had in her hand.William Seabrook. (1941).

Each type of fuel used by the cell requires an alternate pathway of utilization and accessory molecules. In order to conserve resources a cell will only produce molecules that it needs at the time. The level and type of fuel that is available to a cell will determine the type of enzymes it needs to express from its genome for utilization. Receptors on the cell membrane's surface designed to be activated in the presence of specific fuel molecules communicate to the cell nucleus via a means of cascading interactions. In this way the cell is aware of the available nutrients and is able to produce only the molecules specific to that nutrient type. Nutrient Sensing in Mammalian Cells A rapid and efficient response to disturbances in nutrient levels is crucial for the survival of organisms from bacteria to humans. Cells have therefore evolved a host of molecular pathways that can sense nutrient concentrations and quickly regulate gene expression and protein modification to respond to any changes.Zagorski, Nick. \\"Nutrient Sensing, Signaling, & Regulation.\\" Journal of Biological Chemistry. (2010): n. page. Web. 9 Apr. 2013. http://www.jbc.org/site/meeting2010/nutrient Cell growth is regulated by coordination of both extracellular nutrients and intracellular metabolite concentrations. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 serve as key molecules that sense cellular energy and nutrients levels, respectively. *The interplay among nutrients, metabolites, gene expression, and protein modification are involved in the coordination of cell growth with extracellular and intracellular conditions.Molecular Cell, Volume 49, Issue 3, 379-387, 7 February 2013 Living cells use ATP as the most important direct energy source. Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate (or AMP and pyrophosphate) provides energy for most biological processes. The ratio of ATP to ADP and AMP is a barometer of cellular energy status and is therefore tightly monitored by the cell. In eukaryotic cells, AMPK serves as a key cellular energy sensor and a master regulator of metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis. Nutrient Sensing and Epigenetics Nutrient sensing and signaling is a key regulator of epigenetic machinery in cancer. During glucose shortage, the energy sensor AMPK activates arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and mediates histone H3 hypermethylation (H3R17me2), leading to enhanced autophagy. In addition, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) signals glucose availability to TET3 and inhibits TET3 by both decreasing its dioxygenase activity and promoting its nuclear export. OGT is also known to directly modify histones with O-GlcNAc. These observations strongly suggest that nutrient signaling directly targets epigenetic enzymes to control epigenetic modifications. Regulation of Tissue Growth Through Nutrient Sensing Nutrient sensing is a key regulator of tissue growth. The main mediator of cellular nutrient sensing is the protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin). TOR receives information from levels of cellular amino acids and energy, and it regulates the activity of processes involved in cell growth, such as protein synthesis and autophagy. Insulin-like signaling is the main mechanism of systemic nutrient sensing and mediates its growth-regulatory functions largely through the protein kinase pathway. Other nutrition-regulated hormonal mechanisms contribute to growth control of modulating the activity of insulin- like signaling. Nutrient Sensing in Plants Higher plants require a number of essential nutrient elements for completing their life cycles. Mineral nutrients are mainly acquired by roots from the rhizosphere and are subsequently distributed to shoots. To cope with nutrient limitations, plants have evolved a set of elaborate responses consisting of sensing mechanisms and signaling processes to perceive and adapt to external nutrient availability.Cui, Xiaofeng. \\"Nutrient Sensing in Plants.\\" Molecular Plant. (2013): n. page. Web. 9 Apr. 2013 http://mplant.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/19/mp.sss107.full *Plants obtain most necessary nutrients by taking them up from the soil into their roots. Although plants cannot move to a new environment when nutrient availability is less than favorable, they can modify their development to favor root colonization of soil areas where nutrients are abundant. Therefore, plants perceive the availability of external nutrients, like nitrogen, and couple this nutrient sensing to an appropriate adaptive response. Types of Nutrients in Plants Potassium and phosphorus are important macronutrients for crops but are often deficient in the field. Very little is known about how plants sense fluctuations in K and P and how information about K and P availability is integrated at the whole plant level into physiological and metabolic adaptations.\\"Getting to the Root of Nutrient Sensing.\\" Cell Press. (2010): n. page. Web. 9 Apr. 2013 http://phys.org/news195736788.html\\"Nutrient Sensing and Signaling in Plants.\\" ADVANCES IN BOTANICAL RESEARCH INCORPORATING ADVANCES IN PLANT PATHOLOGY. 43. 49. Web. 9 Apr. 2013 Smaller amounts of other micronutrients are also important for the growth of the crop. All of these nutrients are equally important for the growth of the plant and lack of one nutrient can result in poor growth of the plant as well as becoming more vulnerable to diseases or can lead to death. These nutrients along with CO2 and energy from the sun aids in the development of the plant. =Nitrogen Sensing= As one of the most vital nutrients for the development and growth of all plants, nitrogen sensing and the signalling response are vital for plants to live. Plants absorb nitrogen through the soil in the form of either nitrate or ammonia. In soil with low oxygen levels, ammonia is the primary nitrogen source, but toxicity is carefully controlled for with the transcription of ammonium transporters (AMTs). This metabolite and others including glutamate and glutamine have been shown to act as a signal of low nitrogen through regulation of nitrogen transporter gene transcription. NRT1.1, also known as CHL1, is the nitrate transceptor (transporter and receptor) found on the plasma membrane of plants. This is both a high and low affinity transceptor that senses varying concentrations of nitrate depending on its T101 residue phosphorylation. It has been shown that nitrate can also act as just a signal for plants, since mutants unable to metabolize are still able to sense the ion. For example, many plants show the increase of nitrate- regulated genes in low nitrate conditions and consistent mRNA transcription of such genes in soil high in nitrate. This demonstrates the ability to sense nitrate soil concentrations without metabolic products of nitrate and still exhibit downstream genetic effects. = Potassium Sensing = Potassium (K+), one of the essential macronutrients is found in plant soil. K+ is the most abundant cation and it is very limited in plant soil. Plants absorb K+ from the soil through channels that are found at the plasma membrane of root cells. Potassium is not assimilated into organic matter like other nutrients such as nitrate and ammonium but serves as a major osmoticum. Brain and Gut Regulation of Food Intake Maintaining a careful balance between stored energy and caloric intake is important to ensure that the body has enough energy to maintain itself, grow, and engage in activity. When balanced improperly, obesity and its accompanying disorders can result.Dove, Alan. \\"Nutrient Sensing- How the Brain and Gut Regulate Food Intake.\\" Diabetes & Obesity Discussion Group.

She represented the Australian Democrats from 1990 to 2002, and was her party's leader from 1997 ‚Äì 2001. After being deposed by Natasha Stott Despoja, she quit the party to sit as an independent senator in 2002, adopting the party designation Australian Progressive Alliance from 2003 until her electoral defeat in 2005. As party leader, she controversially facilitated passage of the Howard Government's Goods and Services Tax (GST). Family life Lees was born in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. She became a teacher at Ingleburn High School and married Keith Lees, a fellow teacher, in about 1971. In 1974 they moved to Mount Gambier, where their two daughters were born. After both Keith and Meg became involved in the Australian Democrats, they moved to Adelaide, but the pressures of political activity led to the breakdown of their marriage.Gerald Ryle \\"Meg Lees: The Unauthorised Story\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 19 June 1999 On Christmas Eve 2000, shortly before she was deposed as the Democrats' leader in the Senate, Lees was remarried to Adelaide lawyer Matthew Mitchell.Cumming, Fia. \\"Natasha: I'm through making sacrifices for politics\\". The Sun-Herald 7 April 2002. Accessed 30 December 2016 Leadership of the Australian Democrats Cheryl Kernot defected to the Australian Labor Party in October 1997, and Lees was called upon to stand in as acting leader. She was officially chosen as Kernot's replacement in December, with Natasha Stott Despoja becoming her deputy. During her time as leader, the Democrats strengthened the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act, improved the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, negotiated the GST tax reform and maintained the general oversight role of the Democrats in the Senate through a number of Senate inquiries.Wright, Tim. (ed), 2007, 30 Years Australian Democrats In 1999, Prime Minister John Howard proposed the idea of a Goods and Services Tax. It was opposed by the Labor Party, the Australian Greens and independent Senator Brian Harradine, which meant that it required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package or the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan \\"No GST on food\\". A majority of the senators in the party room agreed to pass the bill if some amendments were made, mostly to exclude fresh food and essential items such as basic medicines. Stott Despoja stated that she was unhappy with the outcome, particularly the GST on books. Both Stott Despoja and Queensland Senator Andrew Bartlett ultimately crossed the floor to vote against the GST package. However, a significant number of Democrat members remained unhappy with the GST deal, and began to agitate for a change in leadership. Under the Democrat constitution, a petition of 100 members can trigger a leadership ballot of all the members. On the initial ballot, Meg Lees was returned unchallenged. Subsequently, the Democrats faced a decline in the polls which, by April 2001, were indicating that several senators would lose their seats at the elections due for later that year. The members agitated again for a leadership ballot and, this time, Stott Despoja announced her intention to challenge Lees for the leadership, and was successful, replacing her on 6 April 2001. In mid-2002, Lees began vocally opposing Stott Despoja's leadership, claiming that it had moved the party too far to the left. This culminated in Lees leaving the party to sit as an independent in July 2002. Australian Progressive Alliance In April 2003 Lees announced the founding of the Australian Progressive Alliance, which she claimed would have a more centrist view than the Democrats. However, she was defeated at the October 2004 election and her term expired on 30 June 2005.

Burkhard Christoph Graf von M√ºnnich (, tr. ; ‚Äì ) was a German general who became a field marshal and political figure in the Russian Empire. He was the major Russian Army reformer and founder of several elite military formations during the reign of Anna of Russia. As a statesman, he is regarded as the founder of Russian Philhellenism. M√ºnnich also was a hereditary engineer and a specialist in hydrotechnology. He had the grade of count of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Early career M√ºnnich was born at Neuenhuntorf in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in the military family of Anton G√ºnther M√∂nnich (since 1688 von M√ºnnich, an east-Frisian nobility). Beside the knowledge of the native Low German language he also learned the Latin and French languages. He entered the French service at 17. Thence he transferred successively to the armies of Hesse-Darmstadt and of Saxony where he earned the rank of a colonel and later Major General. In 1721, he was invited by the Russian ambassador in Warsaw Grigoriy Dolgorukov for engineering projects of the newly acquired northern territories. Around that time his father has died. Upon arrival to Russia he presented Peter I plans for the fortification of Kronstadt fortress, which pleasantly surprised the Russian emperor, and the Annenkrone fortification in Vyborg. He was promoted to the Lieutenant General in 1722. Among his first undertakings was the completion of the costly Ladoga Canal, which had been under construction for more than a decade. For his engineering and military- engineering achievements he was promoted to the rank of the General-in-Chief in 1726 by Catherine I, and awarded the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky. In 1727, M√ºnnich was appointed the Governor of Saint Petersburg city while the Imperial court was temporarily transferred to Moscow by Peter II. From 1728 to 1734 he was a General-Governor of Ingria, Karelia, and Finland as well as was awarded the title of a count. During his governorship M√ºnnich improved the local ports, reinforced the newly established Peter and Paul Fortress (1703), and was thinking of building a bridge towards Stockholm. Russian army reformer Upon the coronation of Anna of Russia (1730), he was instructed to prepare the city for the return of Imperial court. After successfully accomplishing that M√ºnnich was promoted to a General-Fieldmarshal, was appointed to the position of president of Russian War Collegiate in 1732 as well as given an order to re-organize the Russian army. M√ºnnich became a founder of the Leib-Guard Cavalry Regiment, the Izmaylovsky Regiment, and the Shlyakhetskiy Cadet Corps which was destined to supply the future generations of officers. M√ºnnich also reformed numerous other military formations as well as the War Collegiate itself. He established a new formation for the Russian army at that time, the Corps which consisted of 12 regiments Cuirassier Cavalry as well as the first Hussar regiments. M√ºnnich revised the table of ranks and evened the salary of the Russian officers with the invited foreign military specialists. He was the first to introduce the sapper regiments to the Russian army as well as founded the Engineer School for Officers. During his administration some 50 other fortresses were erected which substantially improved the well-being of the Russian Armed Forces at that time. Due to the Andrey Osterman affairs, he was released of his duties. Ottoman campaign of 1734-1739 In 1734, by the reference of Ernst Johann von Biron he was sent to take the city of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) and after a prolonged siege and evasion of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski was heavily reproached. However, after that in 1733, the Russian Empire was able to install Augustus III of Poland as the King of Poland (ratified in 1736). In 1736, as the Commander of the Russian army he headed the Turkish campaigns besieging the important ports of Azak and √ñzi. On 21 May 1735 he stormed and sacked Or Qapƒ± penetrating into the Crimea peninsula. M√ºnnich destroyed the important Tatar cities of Kezlev, Aqmescit, and Bakhchisaray. He was forced out of the peninsula due to poor logistics and battle fatigue of his formations, while another General, Count Peter von Lacy, took Azak earning himself a rank of the General field marshall. M√ºnnich refused to resume the campaign the very next year, but he returned to the lower Dnieper steppes in 1737, and on 2 July took the fortress of √ñzi with the help of the Russian artillery. During the sack of √ñzi, he manually raised the regimental banner of the Izmailovsky Regiment on one of the towers of fortress after a successful attack. The siege of √ñzi was also later mentioned in the humorous stories about Baron Munchausen, based on the adventures of the page to Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick, Hieronymus von M√ºnchhausen. Due to the heavy losses, the campaign was paused again while conducting negotiations in Nemirov (Podolie) without much result. In 1739, M√ºnnich won the Battle of Stavuchany, took Khotyn two days later, and established himself firmly in Moldavia. His victory in this campaign was later mentioned in one of the Lomonosov's odes, considered to be the first poem of Russian literature. Threatening to burn down the capital of Moldavia, the city of Ia»ôi, he forced the Moldavian boyars to sign the annexation of Moldavia. After the Ottoman war he was awarded the Order of St. Andrew and the Golden Weapon for Courage. Due to military losses of the Habsburg monarchy and worsening of the relationship with the Swedish Hats, the Russian Empire had to sign the Treaty of Ni≈° by which it had to return the newly acquired Nogai steppes while keeping the fortress of Azak.  Downfall  Marshal M√ºnnich now began to take an active part in political affairs, the particular tone of which was given by his rivalry with Biron, duke of Courland, whom M√ºnnich had arrested in 1740. M√ºnnich's activity was brought to a close in 1741 by the Elizabeth of Russia; he was arrested on his way to the border, and condemned to death. Brought out for execution, and withdrawn from the scaffold, he was later sent to Pelym, Siberia, where he remained for several years, until the accession of Peter III brought about his release in 1762. Catherine II, who soon displaced Peter, employed the old field marshal as director-general of the Baltic ports. M√ºnnich died four years later in Tartu and was buried at his estate nearby.  Legacy  Walhalla memorial. Catherine the Great will say of him \\" If M√ºnnich is not one of the children of Russia, he is one of the fathers \\". Frederick the Great professes great admiration for his exploits and calls him \\"Prince Eugene of the Muscovites\\". Voltaire wrote for his part: It was Prince Eugene of the Muscovites; he had the virtues and vices of the great generals: skilful, enterprising, happy; but proud, superb, ambitious, and sometimes too despotic, and sacrificing the lives of his soldiers for his reputation. Franz Lacy, Keith, L√∂wendal, and other skilful generals, were training in his school . According to Hermann von Manstein, his aide-de-camp: The Count of M√ºnnich is a real contrast of good and bad qualities. Polite, rude, human, carried away, in turn, nothing is easier for him than winning the hearts of those who deal with him. But suddenly, an instant later, he treats them so harshly that they are forced to hate him, so to speak. In certain conditions, we saw him generous, in others of a sordid greed. He is the man of the world who has the highest soul and yet we have seen him do mean things. Pride is a dominant vice. Constantly devoured by an excessive ambition, he sacrificed everything to the world to satisfy it. One of the best engineers in Europe, he was also one of the greatest captains of his century. Often reckless in his businesses, he has always ignored what the impossible is. With a tall and imposing stature, and a robust and vigorous temperament, he seems to have been born general. Ernst Gideon von Laudon and Franz Lacy did their apprenticeship under his orders in front of Otchakov and Khotin. Burckhardt de M√ºnnich is buried in his land of Lunia in Livonia.

Political career Harris was born in Brisbane and was a self-employed businessman and gold miner prior to being chosen as the number two Senate candidate for One Nation at the 1998 election. He came briefly to prominence during the 2003 debate on the legislative reforms to tertiary education, proposed by federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson. After initially indicating he would vote against the legislation, Harris later changed his mind and allowed the reform package to pass, much to the annoyance of student organisations. By the time of the 2004 election One Nation was seriously in decline, and Harris was expected to struggle to retain his seat. With a drastic fall in the One Nation vote nationally, he lost his seat, polling only 0.2 of a quota. His term expired on 30 June 2005.

In 1832 he settled at Leipzig as a journalist, where he co-edited Bl√§tter f√ºr litterarische Unterhaltung, and where he was subjected to a rigorous police supervision. In 1839 he married Klara M√ºller (1814‚Äì1873), who under the name of Luise M√ºhlbach became a popular novelist, and he moved in the same year to Berlin. Here his intention of entering upon an academical career was for a time thwarted by his collision with the Prussian press laws. In 1842, however, he was permitted to establish himself as Privatdozent. In 1848 he was appointed Professor of Literature and History in Breslau, and in 1850 ordinary professor and librarian in Berlin, where he died.

Biography Mundt was born in Humboldt, South Dakota. He was the son of Ferdinand John Mundt (1875‚Äì1947) and Rose (Schneider) Mundt (1874‚Äì1965). Both of his parents were the descendants of German immigrants. Mundt attended public schools in Humboldt, Pierre, and Madison, graduating from Madison High School in 1919. In high school, he excelled in oratory and debate, which became lifetime passions. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1923 with a major in economics, he became teacher and principal at Bryant High School in Bryant, South Dakota. As a first-year teacher he taught speech, psychology, sociology, and government, coached the debate, oratory, and extemporaneous speech teams, and began a school newspaper. After his first year, he was promoted to superintendent of Bryant schools, a position he held until 1927. As superintendent, he continued to coach debate and oratory. In 1924, Mundt married Mary Elizabeth Moses (1900‚Äì1985), a college classmate who also taught at Bryant High School. In 1927, both Karl and Mary Mundt received Master of Arts degrees from Columbia University following four years of summer study there.

He served under William Ewart Gladstone as Education minister from 1880 to 1885 and as President of the Board of Trade in 1886 and from 1892 to 1894. As Education minister he established universal compulsory education in Britain and played the major part in building the state education system. At the Board of Trade he was instrumental in the reduction of working hours and the raising of minimum ages in the employment of children and young people. He was among the first to prove the effectiveness of arbitration and conciliation in industrial relations.A.J.Mundella 1825‚Äì1897 ‚Äî The Liberal Background to the Labour Movement, WHG Armytage, Ernest Benn Limited, London, 1951 He also brought in the first laws to prevent cruelty to children.Sheffield Daily Telegraph, Death of The Right Hon. A. J. Mundella, M.P., 22 July 1897 His political achievements in the late Victorian age are said to have anticipated 20th century society. Early life Mundella was born in Leicester, Leicestershire, England in 1825. Mundella was the first of five children of Antonio Mondelli (later known as Anthony Mundella), a refugee from Lombardy of uncertain background, and his wife Rebecca Allsopp of Leicester. At the time of Mundella's birth, his father was a poorly-paid trimmer in the hosiery trade (but he later became a successful cotton and wool waste merchant). His mother made lace on a lace frame in their home and was regarded as adept at this work but, nonetheless, she too was poorly paid and after rent for housing and for the lace frame there was invariably little left to live on. Mundella was christened on 15 August 1826 at the Great Meeting nonconformist chapel in Leicester. His granddaughter maintained that he was named Antonio GiovanniCall Back Yesterday, Lady Charnwood (Dorothea Benson), Eyre and Spottiswoode, London, 1937 but the Great Meeting baptismal register confirms that he was christened Anthony John. Though from a Catholic and Nonconformist background, he attended the Church of England school of St Nicholas in Leicester, an establishment maintained by the National Society to provide elementary education for children from poor homes, until the age of nine. Though he rebelled against the catechism and disliked the creed, describing them in later life as \\"my especial abomination\\", Mundella remained loyal to his early education in Anglicanism for the rest of his life. Outside school, his mother, with her wide knowledge of English literature, particularly Shakespeare, instilled in his mind a love of the beautiful in nature, in literature, and in art.Sheffield Independent, Death of Mr. A. J. Mundella, M.P., 22 July 1897 Because of the family's then abject financial circumstances, when Rebecca Mundella's eyesight worsened and she could no longer work at lacemaking the boy had to be withdrawn from school so that he could earn money to help the family. At nine, he started work in a printing office as a printer's devil, an opportunity used by him as a means of extending his education. At eleven he was apprenticed to William Kempson, whose business made cuffs, ruffs, tippets, mantillas, boots, shoes, slippers, hosiery and a wealth of other garments and haberdashery.The Surveyor, Engineer, and Architect for the Year 1841, Robert Mudie, Wm S Orr and Co, London, 1841 From his father, and the exiled Italians who occasionally visited the family home, Mundella acquired at an early age what was described as \\"a kind of strange unconventional political education\\". At the age of fifteen he became politically engaged and, inspired by the local Chartist leader, Thomas Cooper, enrolled as a Chartist, becoming increasingly involved in the movement. He became adept at writing political ballads and while still fifteen heard his compositions sung on the streets and at political meetings.Eminent English Radicals in and Out of Parliament, XII, Anthony John Mundella, John Morrison Davidson, W Stewart & Co, London 1880 At the same age he made his first political speech, in support of the Charter.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Anthony John Mundella (1825‚Äî1897), Jonathan Spain, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004 He was further politically inspired by the arrival in Leicester of Richard Cobden on his nationwide campaign for the repeal of the Corn Laws,A.J.Mundella and the Hosiery Industry, WHG Armytage, The Economic History Review, volume al8, Issue 1‚Äì2, April 1948 and was always active with voice and pen in advocating the causes of the working classes. Politics aside, Mundella had always been a regular Sunday School scholar and as he grew older he became a teacher, then secretary, and ultimately superintendent of a large, poor Sunday School in Savey Gate in Leicester. At the age of eighteen Mundella left Kempson's to become first a journeyman, then overseer (in which post he earned ¬£200 a year and a commission on profits) and ultimately manager of a large warehouse set up by another hosiery manufacturing business in Leicester, Harris & Hamel. Richard Harris was a prominent Liberal ‚Äì and Chartist ‚Äì in Leicester. Mundella prospered and, while still eighteen, he married.General Register Office, England and Wales Marriages, 1844 He worked for Harris for three years, until he was 22, and while he was at Harris's the firm experimented seriously and in great secrecy with machinery driven by steam power. Mundella was not technically-minded, though his experience at Harris's with mechanical experimentation helped to form his abiding interest and fascination in new steam-powered hosiery-making machinery.British Industrialists: Steel and Hosiery 1850‚Äî1950, Charlotte Erickson, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1959 He was one of the first men in the Midlands to realise that steam power was something far more than a means to great wealth. He believed that it could be \\"so applied and developed as to lift the mass of workers out of serfdom\\".\\"One of Our Pioneers\\", SK Ratcliffe, John O'London's Weekly, London, 11 January 1952 Manufacturing career In 1848 Mundella was offered a partnership by old-established hosiery manufacturers, Hine & Co of Nottingham, who needed help to construct and open a large new factory. He became a partner in the company, which soon became known as Hine & Mundella. For fifteen years after moving to Nottingham Mundella devoted his energy to reinventing the mechanics of a hosiery industry which for the most part relied on mechanical stocking frames invented in 1589\\"Rev. William Lee, inventor of the Stocking Frame\\". www.victorianweb.org. Retrieved 6 December 2016 being operated by perennially-poor framework-knitters in their own homes.A History of Machine Wrought Hosiery and Lace Manufacture, William Felkin, Longmans Green, London, 1867 He pioneered many changes, including new machines which produced tubular knitting rather than the stocking-frame's straight knit. Mundella had long maintained that the best machines in the hosiery trade were \\"principally the inventions of working men\\".\\"A.J.Mundella and industrial Conciliation\\", JD Marshall, The Guardian, Manchester, England, 19 September 1960 Not by his own brain, but by encouraging inventors within the company (many of them loom operators) and sharing patents with them, Mundella was able to develop much new hosiery-making machinery, a lot of it steam-driven, including a technological revolution: a machine which for the first time enabled a stocking to be made and fully-fashioned by automatic action without stopping the machine. Stockings could now be made a hundred times faster than they could by the framework knitters. Mundella was to take this change on to a personal fortune. He built a large new factory for the company in 1851, the first steam-operated hosiery factory in Nottingham. It had wide and spacious workrooms, was lit entirely by daylight and gas jets, and had the finest machinery. By 1857 Hine and Mundella was employing 4,000, who were well-paid, partly because by attracting good operatives Mundella hoped they would use their intelligence and inventiveness to suggest improvements in the machines. Improved conditions, Mundella observed, brought enhanced loyalty. There was a major setback in 1859 when Hine & Mundella's factory was greatly damaged by fire, but it was soon rebuilt and returned to operation with the advantage of newer and more powerful machines, in large part paid for by the company's insurers. Hine and Mundella continued to prosper. They opened factories in Loughborough in Leicestershire, England in 1859 and Chemnitz, Saxony in 1866. A London warehouse at the centre of the textile trade in Wood Street in the City of London was acquired. In 1860, however, a series of strikes and lock- outs hit Nottingham's hosiery business. The inadequate wages of home framework-knitters compared to those of the factory operatives led to demands for higher pay (although Mundella's employees were not involved). Mundella staged a conference between workers and the employers. He had to contend with suspicious employers and with powerful trade unionists, and reconcile the penurious framework-knitters with the comparatively well-paid and skilled factory workers. He took the lead by proposing that the workers should have the wages they demanded and also that a Board of Arbitration (The Nottingham Board of Arbitration and Conciliation for the Hosiery Trade) composed of both employers and workers should be established to prevent further strikes by fixing the price for handwork and preventing disputes by constant conference between both sides. The essence was that prevention of strife was better than subsequent remedy. Mundella's principle of conciliation was not entirely original; other such boards of conciliation or arbitration had been set up, mostly successfully, in a very few other trades but none of them had been established, like Mundella's, in an industry as antagonistic and complex with technological change as the hosiery trade in Nottingham. Mundella was the first to prove that the principle worked in an industry of much complexity with the aim of, rather than fighting fires, preventing fires starting in the first place. In this aspect the principle was new, and Mundella owned it. It was hailed as a major success and was adopted not only in other parts of the country, but also in continental Europe and in the United States. Carte de visite of Mundella, c1865 In 1863 the stress of business became so great that Mundella's health broke down. He went to Italy and spent two years recuperating. In his absence it was decided to turn the firm of Hine & Mundella into a limited liability company, the Nottingham Hosiery Manufacturing Company. The company continued to expand, developing further interests in Saxony, and Boston in the United States. Mundella had made a notable success out of business. When he joined Hine & Co in 1848 its turnover was ¬£18,000 a year; when he left the business in 1873 (finding it impossible to live in London as an MP and manage a business in Nottingham) its annual turnover was ¬£500,000. He was a prominent and popular public figure in Nottingham and was an active force in his local Liberal Party, becoming Sheriff of Nottingham in 1852, at the age of only 28. In 1856 he was elected a town councillor and helped to set up the Nottingham Chamber of Commerce, of which he was a founder member, serving as President in 1867. From 1859, at the time of increased fear of an invasion by France, he was one of the select founding members of the local volunteer corps, the Robin Hood Rifles, joining in May 1859 and being promoted to Lieutenant in June and Captain five months later. A number of employees at Hine and Mundella (including Mundella's younger brother John, a senior manager there) volunteered for his company.Victorian Nottingham, Volume 15, Richard Iliffe and Wilfred Baguley, The Nottingham Historical Film Unit, Nottingham, 1975 Aside from local political action, Mundella's business experience showed him that progress in industry depended on reciprocal understanding between workers and employers, and that progress generally required significant improvements in the nation's education system, including technical training. He also recognised that very young children could not possibly be properly educated if they were spending their time working in factories. When travelling in continental Europe on business and on personal relaxation, Mundella saw at first-hand how superior the education systems of other countries were, particularly in Switzerland and the German states, and was dismayed at the comparative shortcomings of the English system. He knew that achieving the required progress in these matters would involve collective effort and increasing state intervention. At the same time, his business experience, arising from his humble working past, confirmed his belief in the desirability, indeed necessity, of trade unions. The opportunity to put his beliefs into action appeared unexpectedly in 1868. Election to parliament Mundella's 1863 success in arbitrating the Nottingham industrial strife led to him being invited by many towns around the country to expound on the system of arbitration and to help settle a number of grave labour conflicts. Outbreaks of violence, including explosions and murders, in the Sheffield steel industry (known as the Sheffield Outrages) led to the 1867 Royal Commission on Trade Unions. Mundella showed the Commission that unions could play a positive part in industrial relations, and that working men could be trusted. In 1868 he was invited to address a joint meeting in Sheffield of the organised trades and the local branch of the Reform League. The leaders of his audience were so inspired by his speech that they assured him of their support if he were to stand for the Liberal Party in the Sheffield constituency in the forthcoming General Election. Mundella had already stated that he \\"did not feel obliged to go on toiling to amass a great fortune, but was justified in giving up commerce to devote himself to political life and his love of beautiful things\\". Consequently, he agreed to stand and was formally adopted as a Liberal candidate on 20 July 1868. The subsequent election in Sheffield was a long and bitterly-fought contest. Mundella suffered much abuse. There were attacks on his Italian ancestry; though he was not Jewish he was lampooned by antisemitic cartoonists because of his looks; his morality in business or, as his opponents argued his lack of it, was questioned. But bringing enormous energy to his fight to be elected, and benefitting hugely from the Reform Act of 1867 which had enfranchised a large number of male householders for the first time, Mundella prevailed in Sheffield. He was to represent the seat, and its successor, Sheffield Brightside, until his death nearly thirty years later.British Parliamentary Election Results: 1885‚Äì1918, edited by FWS Craig, Macmillan Press, London, 1974 Political career Mundella took his seat in the House of Commons as part of the Liberal Party majority of 116.British Electoral Facts: 1832‚Äì1987, FWS Craig, Dartmouth: Gower, 1989 With his evident confidence, the respect in which he was held as a pioneer of industrial arbitration and an expert on social matters, combined with the early perception that he was a hard worker, he immediately found himself to be one of the most highly regarded MPs of the new intake. He was chosen to second the reply to the Speech from the Throne and in doing so made his maiden speech on 16 February 1869. The Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, warmly congratulated him on his speech. In the middle of March Mundella's stock rose higher when his Board of Arbitration was commended in the newly-published Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions. =Backbencher= Mundella's main concerns on joining the House were trade union reform and the need for free, compulsory schooling and for technical training. In regard to the former, trade unionism had no greater friend than Mundella. He was a firm believer in the right of working men and women to combine to protect their interests, and much of his energy in Parliament was devoted to securing the same rights for them as were enjoyed by their employers. In 1869 Mundella began to plan a Private Members' Bill to legalise the unions and attempt to give them financial security. Though the Bill did not proceed, his efforts did secure a temporary Government Bill which gave protection to trade union funds and two years later led to the Trade Union Act 1871 which legalised trade unions for the first time and protected their funds by legal registration. Anthony John Mundella by Co√Ød√© (James Jacques Tissot). A chromolithograph published in Vanity Fair, 9 December 1871Mundella‚Äôs first moves in the House regarding education were strongly to support the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870. His speech on the second reading of the Bill did much to enhance his parliamentary reputation. Though the Act established local education authorities and authorised public money for school improvements, it did not meet with Mundella‚Äôs complete approval as it introduced neither free nor compulsory schooling (except in a tentative, experimental way through the by-laws which school boards were empowered to make), but he was anxious to take what Parliament was willing to give rather than reject it because it was not good enough. The trade unions and education were not Mundella‚Äôs sole concerns in his early years as a backbencher. Over time he attacked the War Office for its antiquated system for issuing army contracts, and advocated short army and navy service, more volunteers and better organisation. He joined in an attempt to modernise the Patent Laws (for a long time these had been his concern as an industrialist). He spoke against what he called the \\"absurdity\\" of the complicated and inconsistent postal rates. He denounced the obsolete game laws, whose savage punishments for poaching jailed many thousands of men. And he attacked the inconsistent treatment of men and women in the Contagious Disease Acts of the 1860s which in ports and garrison towns subjected female prostitutes (or those suspected of being such) to arrest, inspection, and (if they were found to be infected) incarceration for up to one year, while no provision was made for the examination of their male customers. He also pressed for the legal age of sexual intercourse to be raised to 16, since over 25 per cent of those with sexually transmitted infections were under that age. Mundella was also greatly concerned at the employment of children of very young ages, and how their presence at work would make compulsory elementary education impossible. In 1871 he put forward a measure to control the employment of children in the manufacture of bricks and tiles. His move was welcomed so readily that it was incorporated into the government's Factory and Workshop Act of 1871. As a result, the employment of girls under sixteen and boys under ten in brick and tile yards was prohibited. Mundella's long-established interest in arbitration resulted in 1872 in his Arbitration (Masters and Workmen) Act (commonly known as Mundella's Act) which made voluntary agreements between managers and workers mutually binding. In the same year he aided the passage of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, paying particular attention to the clauses restricting the working hours of women and children. He continued his campaign for fewer hours for women and children with the introduction of a Nine-Hours Factory Bill in 1872 but it made slow progress and in the summer of 1873, due to opposition from manufacturers, it was withdrawn. Mundella's perennial concern for children also led him to introduce, in 1873, a Bill for the Protection of Children against people who, being in charge of them, had been convicted of violence against them. =Opposition backbencher= In the General Election of 1874, the Liberal Party was defeated, but Mundella continued his radical parliamentary campaigns from the opposition backbenches and reintroduced his Nine-Hours Bill. The Conservative government, reaping the fruits of Mundella's three years' hard work on his Bill, introduced their own Factory Bill which was designed to achieve much the same aims. The subsequent Factories (Health of Women, &c.;) Act of 1875 established a ten-hour day for women and children in textile factories. It was widely recognised in the textile districts that it was Mundella's efforts which had secured its passing. Mundella was also praised ‚Äì this time by the trade union leadership ‚Äì for his opposition backbench role in amending, and enabling the passing of, firstly, in 1875, the Employers and Workmen Bill which replaced the repressive Masters and Servants Acts, and secondly the passing of the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Bill which, combined with the repeal of the much-hated Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871, released workers from severe penalties which were aimed solely at them. Both Acts together fully decriminalised the work of trade unions. To Mundella at this time was also the credit for his Bill instituting a close season from 15 March to 15 June for fresh-water fish. Encouragement for this move had come from his own Sheffield constituency. The previous twenty years had seen an enormous expansion in the number of anglers. In 1878 Sheffield alone had 211 angling clubs, with 8,000 members, and there was much concern about over-fishing, particularly in the breeding period.Mundella and the Origins of the Close Season, Bill Lucy, The Freshwater Informer, Hawkhurst, Kent, England, 1999 Known officially as the Freshwater Fisheries Act and colloquially amongst anglers as the Mundella Act, it became law in 1878. In 1877 Mundella sponsored a Bill to abolish the property qualification for standing for local office, pointing out that 80 to 90 per cent of the voters in his constituency were disqualified from being councillors and yet were the first to be pressured by rises in rates. The bill found little traction in the House and each time it reappeared in the period from 1877 to 1879 it was defeated. Ironically, (as often happened with Mundella's defeated Bills) the Conservatives finally passed the measure in 1880. =Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education= The Liberals returned to power in 1880 with a large majority and Gladstone, recognising the younger man's unequalled expertise in the field of education reform (and buoyed by his support for Irish Home Rule, Mundella being prepared to support any measures which would tranquilise unhappy Ireland), appointed him Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education (what would now be known as Secretary of State for Education). At the same time Mundella was also appointed a Privy Councillor. When Queen Victoria received his name from Gladstone she described him in her diary as \\"Mr. Mundella (one of the most violent radicals)‚Äù. She wrote that on remarking, somewhat disapprovingly, to Gladstone about Mundella's appointment \\"Mr. Gladstone praised him very much, saying he was a very religious man, very much for religious education, and never said anything offensive\\".Letters of Queen Victoria, edited by GE Buckle, (2nd series), iii, 89, John Murray, London, 1932 At the same time, Mundella was also appointed the fourth Charity Commissioner for England and Wales. Despite being junior to the Lord President of the Council Mundella was in effect in charge of Education, and he was now positioned to achieve a number of his strong and long-held aims, in particular, that of compulsory elementary education, and he set to work with vigour, despite strong opposition. Referring to Mundella's researches into schooling in continental Europe, The Times sneered at the source of his inspiration, declaring that \\"compulsory education might do for the Saxons, but would never be endured by the Anglo-Saxons\\". To those organisations and people who maintained that compulsion was un-English he retorted that it was peculiarly English to be content to be in ignorance. Despite such attacks, immediately on reaching office Mundella introduced a Bill to complete the system of compulsion to attend school, which had not been achieved by previous Acts. The Mundella Act (yet another Act credited to his name), properly known as the Elementary Education Act 1880, which became law only four months after the Liberals returned to power, finally established the means to enforce that all children would be sent to school. Mundella then, secondly, set in motion the reorganisation of technical education. He had always taken an interest in higher and technical education, as well as in art schools and other forms of art culture, and it had invariably secured his sympathy and aid. Most notably, as his first move in higher education, Mundella formed a single institution of the scientific schools at South Kensington in London, establishing the Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines in October 1881. His third immediate act on becoming Education Minister was to appoint a departmental committee to investigate and make recommendations on higher education in Wales. The committee reported in 1881 and urged the immediate expansion of the Welsh intermediate schools and the establishment of university colleges in Cardiff and Bangor. Mundella further instituted a Royal Commission to examine foreign technical education and compare it with that available in England. Mundella's responsibilities also included the further development of the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum), which as a lover of art he found to be an enjoyable part of his labours. Significantly, his educational code of 1882, which became known as the \\"Mundella Code,\\" marked a new departure in the regulation of public elementary schools, their curricula and how they were taught, and the conditions under which government grants were made. By 1883 money was made available to allow the code to operate. Mundella improved the inspection of schools, including employing some women inspectors, and insisting that the health and mental capacity of children should be taken into consideration when examining their learning progress. He also arranged beneficial change in teacher training. There were accusations that the strictness of the code was harsh and was causing children to overwork. To this the prestigious medical journal The Lancet declared: \\"The educational system is not overworking children but demonstrating that they are underfed.The Lancet, 4 August 1883, London This conclusion roused Mundella to urge local government to provide cheap meals for children. While in England and Wales, endowments for higher education schools were being surveyed and where necessary reformed, no such action was taking place in Scotland. Mundella introduced an exhaustive Bill to overhaul the Scottish endowments, and a Bill which was intended to extend compulsory elementary education to Scotland. He now tried to modernise the Committee of the Council on Education by proposing the institution of an Education Department headed by a minister with a position in the Cabinet, and the setting up of a Department of Agriculture which would take over his veterinary responsibilities (peculiarly part of the Education portfolio), but he was forestalled by the opposition of the Lord President of the Council. In May 1884 the Royal Commission set up by Mundella to examine technical education asserted that it should not only be for artisans and mechanics, but should also include other disciplines such as languages, mathematics, history, and geography. The Commission further recommended that scholarships from schools to the technical colleges should be established. In May 1885 he was able to begin the process of introducing a measure to promote intermediate education in Wales, but on 9 June 1885 Gladstone resigned and Mundella was forced as a result to leave the Vice- presidency. His Welsh legislation fell at the dissolution of Parliament. =Opposition frontbencher= In the General Election of October 1885, Mundella stood for the new constituency of Brightside, one of Sheffield's five parliamentary divisions. He was elected with a healthy majority, but nationally the General Election was a stalemate, and the Conservatives took office with the help of Charles Stewart Parnell and his Irish Parliamentary Party, which held the balance of power. Mundella was once again in Opposition, but maintained his place on the Liberal frontbench. He did not languish there for long as Gladstone returned to the Prime Ministership barely three months later in January 1886 and after briefly considering Mundella for the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer he instead elevated him to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade, one of only fourteen members of the Cabinet. =President of the Board of Trade (first term)= Mundella by Arthur Stockdale Cope, 1894In the short period before the next General Election Mundella had little time at the Board of Trade to effect major legislative improvements but he was able to introduce a number of administrative changes. Once again, with the same vigour he had shown in taking charge of Education, he moved swiftly into action. Firstly, he ensured that consular reports of trade and the trade requirements of different countries of the world should be published and available at a low price instead of being lost among general Foreign Office papers. Secondly, he established a labour statistics bureau to allow information to be published and disseminated to the labouring class. Thirdly, he expanded the Board to include a fisheries department, previously the realm of three different government departments, to look after both sea and inland fisheries. (It was later to be united with the Agriculture department set up in 1899 at Mundella's instigation, though after his death.) There had long been bitter disputation over the matter of railway freight charges, with the railway companies' trade and agricultural customers bitterly opposed to the high prices charged for the movement of goods. As a means to secure a just and equitable re-assessment of the charges throughout Britain Mundella introduced his Railway and Canal Traffic Bill, which, were it to become law, would give large powers of control over the railways to the Board of Trade, including the power to enforce reductions in the charges. Unsurprisingly, Mundella met vehement opposition from the railway companies and their shareholders, fearful that there would be a fall in their profits of up to 50 per cent and a destruction of the value of railway property. Fresh fuel for their anger was Mundella's introduction of a Railway Regulation Bill which sought to impose better braking and other safety devices. Opposition to the Railway and Canal Traffic Bill rode on the back of the then widespread and equally vehement opposition in the House to Irish Home Rule. In a division on the Irish matter, Gladstone's government fell, and with it Mundella's attempted radical reform of the railways (though the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, remarkably similar to Mundella's in effect, and with his encouragement from the Opposition benches, became law under the Conservatives in 1888.) =Opposition frontbencher= Mundella's short period in charge of the Board of Trade ended on 30 July 1886 and in the General Election in August the Conservatives regained power. From the Opposition frontbench Mundella once again took up the fight for increased technical education among working people. With others, he was instrumental in inaugurating the National Association for the Promotion of Technical EducationNational Association for the Promotion of Technical Education, Special Collections, University of Leeds and pressed ahead in the House demanding further reforms. Over the next few years the Association was a major force behind educational development, including secondary as well as technical education. Mundella also presided over the new National Education Association formed to promote a \\"free progressive system of national education, publicly controlled and free from sectarian interest\\" both by publicising and advancing the School Board system and by undermining denominational and private schools.National Education Association, Records, A/NEA, London Metropolitan Archives In 1888 Mundella introduced a Bill for the prevention of cruelty to children. Due to opposition, progress of the bill was slow, with Mundella speaking no fewer than 65 times in Committee. The ensuing Prevention of Cruelty to, and Protection of, Children Act 1889 (commonly known as the Children's Charter) was the first Act of Parliament to outlaw cruelty to children. It enabled the state to intervene in relations between parents and children, made it an imprisonable crime to neglect or ill-treat children, and outlawed the employment of children under the age of 10. Mundella regarded this Act as one of his greatest successes. In 1890 Mundella became chairman of the Trade and Treaties Committee, responsible for keeping the Board of Trade informed on expiring treaties and new tariffs and duties. In 1891 and 1892, on the urging of Gladstone, he became an Opposition frontbench representative on the Royal Commission on Labour. He chaired the section dealing with conditions in the chemical, building, textile, clothing and miscellaneous trades. Remarkably, he was also able to institute the appointment of four women inspectors to examine the position of women in industry. =President of the Board of Trade (second term)= In the 1892 General Election Mundella retained his seat of Sheffield Brightside with a larger majority than ever before and the Liberal Party as a whole once again formed the Government. Mundella returned to the Cabinet and to the Presidency of the Board of Trade. There he faced his old foes, the railway companies and their shareholders, as the agricultural lobby and businesses were still anxious to see reduced freight charges. Cautious of raising the ire of the railway companies again, in 1893 Mundella set up a committee to look into the matter of the charges. He did, however, enable the Railway Servants (Hours of Labour) Act, which allowed railway employees to reduce their working hours. Also, early in 1893, the Bureau of Labour Statistics which Mundella set up in his first term as Trade minister was expanded into a Labour department, separate from the Board of Trade. This department published a regular Labour Gazette to ensure that information about labour was popularised in order to reach the working classes. 1893 saw a huge lock-out of miners in the Midlands, with nearly 320,000 men who were objecting to a reduction in pay being thrown out of work. The conflict encouraged Mundella to introduce a Bill to enable the establishment of local boards of conciliation and arbitration whenever and wherever they might be required. Mundella had professed the healing power of conciliation and arbitration for over thirty years, and it was as the result of conciliation that the coal strike was settled. Mundella's influence in this success was readily recognised. His Bill to establish the local boards eventually became law as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act under the Conservatives in 1896. Additionally in 1893, Mundella enabled three separate maritime reforms. The North Sea Fisheries Act ratified the convention between the countries bordering the North Sea fishing areas to deal with the evil of floating alcohol \\"shops\\" which supplied fishermen with liquor. An improvement in the way merchant seamen were paid their wages at the end of a voyage ensured they did not have to linger for long periods in the seaports rather than returning home, thereby reducing the problem of prostitution in the ports. And a Merchant Shipping Bill was introduced to halt the undermanning of ships. Appalled by the annual returns of railway accidents and deaths furnished by the Board of Trade, Mundella was also able to appoint two railway men to inquire into the accidents and their causes, and to find means to increase safety. Mundella's stock was now high. Early in 1894 Gladstone wrote of him: \\"He ‚Ä¶ has done himself much credit in the present government\\".Gladstone Letter Book for 1894, Add. MSS.445498, f.371, Gladstone's Library, Hawarden Mundella was soon to leave the Cabinet, however. =Resignation= In 1869 Mundella had joined the board of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company. The company's business was to make advances to sheep-farming colonists in New Zealand and Australia on the security of their land and produce, and to help market that produce in Britain. It was a successful venture and Mundella's pecuniary interest prospered. Under newly-established rules, on becoming President of the Board of Trade in 1892 he relinquished all his directorships and thereafter had no control over the company's activities. In 1893, as a result of an economic downturn, the company was forced into liquidation and became the subject of a Board of Trade inquiry. Though Mundella was no longer a director and was innocent of any fault, a conflict of interest existed because the final decision on what further proceedings should follow a public investigation in court (in which Mundella gave evidence) would have to be made by Mundella himself as President of the Board of Trade. He was compromised, and his role as President became unsustainable. Mundella tendered his resignation to Lord Rosebery, by then Prime Minister, who was disinclined to agree and requested him to withdraw it. After some consideration, Mundella insisted upon it and his resignation took effect on 12 May 1894.Dictionary of National Biography, First Edition, Supplement Volume 3, Smith, Elder & Co, London, 1901 On 24 May, from a corner seat next the gangway on the second bench, immediately behind the Government ministers,\\"Lord Rosebery's Tribute to Mr Mundella\\", Northern Echo, Darlington, County Durham, 25 May 1894 he addressed the House of Commons on the matter. The magazine Punch wrote: \\"The House felt that here was a good man suffering with adversity. That it was undeserved, had swooped down, and blighted temporarily an honourable career when it seemed to have reached its serener heights, made the calamity none the less hard to bear. Mundella comported himself with the dignity that commanded the respect of the House. (He) sat down amid cheering on both sides\\".H W Lucy, Punch, London, 19 May 1894 Mundella at the House of Commons by John Benjamin Stone, 1897Mundella himself wrote to his sister Theresa: \\"I was received with loud cheering when I entered the House, when I rose to address it, and the loudest from all sides when I sat down. Men crowded round me all night to shake hands with me, and all my colleagues said I had done it so admirably and with so much dignity\\"A J Mundella, 25 May 1894, private correspondence with Theresa Wardle, n√©e Mundella, Mundella Family Archive Of some consolation were tributes from Gladstone and Rosebery (the latter insisting that it was a \\"source of grief and weakness\\" to the Government to be deprived of his \\"great\\" services), and the hundreds of resolutions of sympathy from workers all over the country which reached him, thanking him for his life-long services to labour. He was not to return to ministerial power, and served on the backbenches until the General Election of 1895. =Government backbencher= In the year following his resignation, Mundella arbitrated successfully in the Hanley Pottery dispute in March 1895 and was intensively occupied as Chairman of the committee examining the wretched poor law schools in London. =Opposition frontbencher= The General Election of July 1895 saw the Conservatives win with an overall majority of 152 and the Liberal Party were back in Opposition. Mundella, still held in high esteem by his constituents, was returned unopposed for Sheffield Brightside, and his colleagues in the House, holding him in equally high regard despite his resignation the year before, recalled him to the Opposition frontbench. From that position, despite age beginning to tell, he continued his vehement fight for the causes he held most dear. In particular he strongly opposed the Education Bills of 1896 and 1897 which he saw as destructive of the education policy to which he had devoted much of his political life, and he deplored the fact that the compulsory clauses of his Education Act were scarcely enforced so that nearly one-fifth of the potential school population was absent. The result, he pointed out, was widespread illiteracy among those of school-leaving age. Mundella's final utterance in the House (after 3,280 vocal contributions over nearly thirty years as an MP) was a brief interjection in the debate on the second reading of the Education (Scotland) Bill on 1 July 1897. Death Mundella died unexpectedly. On 13 July 1897 he told a friend, \\"I have never felt better in my life\\". The following morning Mundella's butler went to wake him but found him \\"prostrated and unconscious\\" on his bedroom floor. He remained paralysed after his stroke with a complete loss of speech, and he was barely conscious for eight days. Many people, including Queen Victoria (who telegraphed a number of times for news) and leading politicians of all shades of opinion, expressed grave concern. At 1.55 pm on 21 July 1897 he died, at the age of 72.General Register Office, England and Wales Deaths, 1897The Times, London, 22 July 1897Mundella's burial place: The Mundella vault, Church Cemetery, Nottingham No fewer than three funeral services were held. The first was at St Margaret's, Westminster on 26 July. It was unusual for St Margaret's in that Mundella's coffin was present, rather than the service being a memorial. The coffin was draped in a pall of Venetian brocade, with a marble statuette of the Madonna and Child and a photograph of Mundella's late wife placed at its head. Queen Victoria sent a wreath, and she and the Prince of Wales were represented amongst a very large number of male and female mourners. The church was full and later congregants were forced to assemble outside. It was noted that an unusually large number of working men had come to pay their respects to Mundella.Sheffield Independent, The Late Mr. Mundella ‚Äì Memorial service at St. Margaret's, Westminster, 27 July 1897 His coffin was then taken through the centre of London to St Pancras station for transfer by train to Nottingham. A second funeral service was held in Nottingham at St Mary's Church on 27 July. It was the largest funeral the city had ever seen. Huge crowds then lined the route from St Mary's to the Church Cemetery, where further mourners crowded onto the hillside overlooking the grave. A third service was conducted at the graveside. He was buried in the ten-feet-deep Mundella vault where his parents, his wife and his youngest brother had been previously interred. A wide stone in a combination of classical styles with the then fashionable Arts and Crafts decoration was erected over the tomb. To Mundella's name was added the inscription: \\"Loving knowledge for its own sake, he strove to diffuse it among his countrymen. He laboured for industrial peace, and the welfare of the children of the poor.\\" Legacy and reputation Mundella was highly respected during his long period in Victorian Liberal politics, achieving elevation to the Cabinet and attaining the distinction of becoming known as a Statesman. It has been argued that his was \\"the most productive mind in late Victorian England at work in the kindred fields of education, industry and labour\\" and as a result his political achievements in those fields were remarkable. By such work he prepared the late Victorian age for the dawning of the 20th century. Many of the improvements he fostered have been altered somewhat in the years since his death for good or bad, but the long-term effects of everything he enabled remain with us in the 21st century. Children must still go to school, trade unions are still legal, freshwater fish are still allowed a peaceful breeding season. In the light of the powerful influence he had on education, industry, and the protection of children it would have been expected that he would be f√™ted as the 20th century took hold. But after his death in 1897 his reputation swiftly diminished. For 55 years he was mostly the forgotten man of Gladstone's administrations. It has been suggested that one reason was the absence of an early biography.Legalised Trade Unions, Compulsory Primary Schooling, Enhanced Higher Education ‚Äî the Legacies of Anthony John Mundella, 1825‚Äì1897, Michael Davey, PhD Thesis, University of Adelaide, 2020 It was the intention of Mundella's daughter Maria Theresa to write his biography (which would undoubtedly have been celebratory), but despite working for some years on his archive, collecting contributions and loans from others, and making lengthy transcriptions, nothing was published. She died in 1922. Her collected Mundella papers then passed to his granddaughter, Dorothea Benson, Lady Charnwood, who presented them to the University of Sheffield Library in the 1930s.\\"Notes\\", The Mundella Papers, Sheffield University Library, Sheffield A biography finally appeared.

But such occasional kick-starting has failed to fire the engine of modern-day regard for Mundella‚Äôs reputation. He is absent from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and until very recently, wikipedia‚Äôs entry was brief and incomplete. There is no public monument to him. Mundella Grammar School in Nottingham no longer exists. A request in the mid-1980s for the installation of a commemorative blue plaque at Mundella's London home of 16 Elvaston Place was refused by English Heritage.Correspondence, Survey and General Branch, London Division, English Heritage, 5 April 1988 Cope's portrait of Mundella is no longer on public display. The National Portrait Gallery in London has never shown ‚Äì other than online ‚Äì any of the Mundella likenesses it holds. Mundella‚Äôs contribution to British society, to education, to labour relations, to the trade unions, and to child protection remains almost, but not completely, forgotten. Personal life On 12 March 1844, when aged only eighteen, Mundella married Mary, the daughter of William Smith, a warehouseman of Kibworth Beauchamp in Leicestershire. She was described as \\"a woman of lofty mind and great determination\\"Sheffield Daily Telegraph, London Letter, 23 July 1897 and fully shared her husband's literary and artistic sympathies. Her \\"quiet, clever criticisms\\" were said to delight her guestsWestminster Gazette, Death of Mr. Mundella, London, 22 July 1897 and she was credited with an \\"unselfish, gentle, and sunny disposition\\"Nottingham Evening Post, Metropolitan Notes, 16 December 1890 She died after a short illness on 14 December 1890.General Register Office, England and Wales Deaths, 1890 Their marriage was described as \\"outstandingly happy\\" and \\"blissful\\" and Mundella was said to have been \\"inconsolable\\" at his wife's death. \\"She was loved and honoured in an extraordinary degree by all from the highest to the humblest,\\" Mundella wrote to his sister Theresa. \\"What a romance it all seems, Alas! What a terrible drama for me!\\"A J Mundella, 29 December 1890, private correspondence with Theresa Wardle n√©e Mundella, Mundella Family Archive His manner after his bereavement was said to have become sharper and more intolerant, as observed by another MP in the House of Commons.LJ Jennings MP, Hansard, 3 July 1891 Mundella and his wife had two children, Eliza Ellen, known in the family as \\"Nelly\\", who married Roby Thorpe of Nottingham, and Maria Theresa, known as \\"Pen\\", who remained single and lived at Elvaston Place until her death. When Mundella was a manufacturer he commissioned a large new villa, designed by the architect Thomas Chambers Hine, at 19 Cavendish Crescent South in the fashionable The Park Estate in Nottingham, and after moving to London when he became an MP they lived, firstly, in Dean's Yard in Westminster, then rented a house in Stanhope Gardens in Kensington before, at the end of 1872, purchasing 16 Elvaston Place nearby. While he had made money in business, Mundella (as an unpaid politician) had never been particularly rich. In 1875 he wrote to a friend: \\"I care for nothing but to do my duty to my constituency, to live honestly and free of debt, and to leave to the three poor women dependent upon me enough to maintain them in the position in which I may leave them, free from the reverses of fortune and the buffetings of the world.\\"AJ Mundella, letter to Robert Leader (Editor of the Sheffield Independent), 11 October 1875, Mundella Papers, Sheffield University The crash of the New Zealand company which had been the cause of Mundella's resignation left him in severe financial difficulties, but on the recommendation of Lord Rosebery he was fortified by the receipt of a rarely-awarded (and, to some controversy in the press, tardily announced) Civil List pension of ¬£1,200 a year which enabled him to continue to live in Elvaston Place.\\"Mr.Mundella's Pension\\", Sheffield Daily Telegraph, 14 September 1895 Mundella had a striking presence, being tall and thin and bent at the shoulders with a dark complexion, a prominent hooked nose and a flowing beard. He reminded some of an Old Testament prophet. Easily recognisable, he was reported to be a familiar figure in London, in the summer months \\"in his light suit of clothes and white hat\\", while in the House of Commons the gorgeous and multi-coloured hue of his socks \\"used to be the admiration of young members\\". In character he was described as warm, impulsive, enthusiastic, and optimistic, and ready to believe the best in anyone. He had a flashing smile, a loud, bass laugh, brassy eloquence, and a jocular style. He was cultured, well-informed, and well-read (often offering an appropriate quotation, particularly from Shakespeare or one of the Poets) and always found time to keep in touch with modern thought and literature. He was an apt and ready speaker and in the House and outside he always went directly to the point. It has been observed, however, that \\"Mundella made enemies at every stage. He was far too confident and masterful for a quiet life, and in an age of overflowing political activity his mind and methods appeared to stand for the whole menace of radical change.\\" As he grew older the Cabinet held him in high esteem but younger politicians were \\"never quite sure whether he was a rogue or a fool, but they were convinced that he was a bore\\" because of his obsessive harping on a few dominant themes. Their impatience with him ignored the attributes his contemporaries valued; as his biographer, Harry Armytage, observed: Mundella was \\"supple, diplomatic, humane\\". At home, Mundella had a great regard for domestic comforts and liked to be surrounded by beautiful things. Just as he was ahead of others in his politics, so he led in his artistic tastes: he was noted as a collector, long before others, of old Chelsea porcelain and Crown Derby. In furniture, English marqueterie took his eye, and he acquired \\"all the Chippendale he could lay his hands on\\". One of Mundella's nieces recalled that he and his family flourished at a time when all things Italian were fashionable and having Italian ancestry was considered most desirable. She remembered him having breakfast in bed wearing a red Garibaldi jacket (a garment usually made of scarlet Cashmere wool with military trimmings of gold braid, and popularised as ‚Äì generally ‚Äì a woman's shirt during the early 1860s). 16 Elvaston Place, she recalled, was full of beautiful Italian things.Theresa Hastings n√©e Mundella, private memoir, Mundella Family Archive The house was often crowded with friends, not only politicians, but also many from the world of the arts and literature, business, and journalism. 16 Elvaston Place was celebrated by those who visited. One leading Editor of the day stated that the Mundella family \\"were nearer the exact mark politically, socially, and in all points of feeling than almost any.\\" To get away from London, Mundella had a particular taste for travelling on the continent of Europe, being especially fond of Switzerland and Italy. One of his favourite destinations was a hotel built in 1867 on the summit of Monte Generoso on the border of the two countries. From there could be viewed Lombardy where Mundella's father had been born and spent his childhood and youth, and Lake Lugano and the Alps beyond which his father had crossed on his escape to England. The Mundellas holidayed for lengthy periods when the House was not sitting. The newspapers of August 1894, for instance, reported that Mundella had left England for a holiday in Switzerland and Italy, accompanied by his unmarried sister Mary and his daughter Maria Theresa, and it was not until October that year the Court Circular reported that the threesome had just returned.\\"Court Circular\\", London Daily News, London, 19 October 1894 A Fellow of the Royal Society, an honour awarded in 1882 that Mundella described as \\"the most agreeable and distinguished that could fall upon me\\", he belonged to the Reform, Savile, and Athenaeum Clubs. He also, in 1884, became President of the Sunday School Union, a position he deeply valued. He possessed the talent to attract and retain many friends, and while he was eternally faithful to the workers from whom he had sprung, and determined to remain close to his roots, his elevation in political life brought him into the sphere of the rich, the aristocratic, and the royal. After her initial suspicion, Queen Victoria learned to care deeply for him and was distressed by his death. She claimed Mundella reminded her \\"so much\\" of John Brown (her favoured outdoor servant).Mundella Correspondence, Henry James, 12 May 1897 She invited him for weekends at Windsor, Osborne, and Sandringham. Mundella was intensely proud of his Italian ancestry for which he was regularly mocked by opposing politicians, and though he was not Jewish (his mother being a Protestant, his father a Catholic), throughout his political life his looks, his foreign- sounding name, and his artistic individualism in dress encouraged opponents and hostile cartoonists and journalists to indulge in anti-semitic insults.Life of John Viriamu Jones, Katharine Viriamu Jones, Smith, Elder & Co, London, 1915 Despite Mundella's claim when applying for his Civil List pension in 1894 that he had \\"insufficient private means\\", at his death, three years later, his estate was valued at ¬£42,619 1s 3d.Principal Probate Registry, Calendar of the Grants of Probate and Letters of Administration made in the Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice in England, London, England Mundella likenesses * Portrait in oil: by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope RA (1857‚Äì1940).

Munby worked in the antiquarian book trade with Bernard Quaritch, Limited (1935‚Äì37) and Sotheby & Company (1937‚Äì39, 1945‚Äì47). He became Librarian at King's College, Cambridge in 1947 and Fellow in 1948; he was J.P.R. Lyell Reader in Bibliography, University of Oxford (1962‚Äì63) and Sandars Reader in Bibliography, University of Cambridge (1969‚Äì70).http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt2f59q0js/ He was elected President of the Bibliographical Society in 1974 and died during his term of office.

Adrien Albert Marie, Comte de Mun (, 28 February 18416 October 1914), was a French political figure and Social Reformer of the nineteenth century. Biography =Early years= Albert was born at Lumigny-Nesles-Ormeaux, Seine-et-Marne, son of the marquess de Mun. He became the brother in law of the Duke of Ursel when is sister Antonine de Mun left for Belgium. He entered the French Army, saw much service in Algeria (1862), and took part in the fighting around Metz in 1870 (during the Franco-Prussian War). On the surrender of Metz, he was sent as a prisoner of war to Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), where he met Ren√© de La Tour du Pin. They both were determined to respond to the dilemma of the working class upon their release from prison. The following year they organized a Catholic Workers' club, under the name \\"L'Oeuvre des Cercles Catholiques d'Ouvriers\\" (Society of Catholic Worker Circles), at the request of Maurice Maignen (founder of the Brothers of St. Vincent de Paul). The clubs spread quickly throughout France. These \\"circles\\" or clubs brought together the wealthy and the workers from a given locale for prayer, socializing, and hearing lectures by members of the aristocracy. He also assisted in the capture of Paris from the Paris Commune. A fervent Roman Catholic, Albert devoted himself to advocating Social Catholicism. His attacks on Third French Republic's social policy ultimately provoked a prohibition from the Minister of War. He thereupon resigned his commission (November 1875), and in the following February stood as Royalist and Catholic candidate for Pontivy. The influence of the Church was exerted to secure his election, and, during the proceedings, he was awarded the Order of Saint Gregory the Great by Pope Pius IX. He won the next elections for the same area, but the result was declared invalid. De Mun was re-elected, however, in the following August, and for many years was the most conspicuous leader of the anti-Republican party. \\"We form\\", he said on one occasion, \\"the irreconcilable Counter-Revolution\\". He was also a resolute opponent of Socialism: \\"Socialism is logical Revolution and we are Counter-Revolution. There is nothing in common between us.\\" He was a prominent Anti-Dreyfusard as well as a committed antisemite who believed Jews were plotting an international conspiracy and casually referred to them as youtres (French equivalent of \\"kikes\\"). =Later years= As far back as 1878 he had declared himself opposed to universal suffrage, a declaration that lost him his seat from 1879 to 1881. He spoke strongly against the expulsion of the French princes (after the Count of Paris rose suspicions that he was preparing to claim the throne), and it was chiefly through his influence that the support of the Royalist party was given to Georges Boulanger. But as a faithful Catholic, he obeyed the modernising encyclical of 1891, Rerum novarum, and declared his readiness to rally to a Republican government, provided that it respected religion. In the following January he received from Leo XIII a letter commending his action, and encouraging him in his social reforms. He was defeated at the general election of that year, but in 1894 was elected in Finist√®re (Morlaix). In 1897 he succeeded Jules Simon as a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, owing to the quality and eloquence of his speeches, which, with a few pamphlets, form the bulk of his published work. In Ma vocation sociale (1908) he wrote an explanation and justification of his career.

He was the eleventh Librarian of the United States Congress from 1954 to 1974. Biography Mumford was born in Hanrahan, North Carolina to Jacob Edward Mumford, a tobacco farmer, and Emma Luvenia Stocks. He grew up working the farm alongside his 10 siblings when he was not in school. He attended Grifton High School where he excelled in debate winning school and district honors. Mumford also participated in school athletics where he played baseball and tennis. Upon graduation, Mumford was granted a tuition scholarship to attend Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina; his educational goal focused on preparing for a teaching career. At Trinity College, Mumford followed the lead of his brother Grover and joined the Hesperian Society. As a member he continued to be active in debate, winning several distinguished awards for excellence in public speaking and debate. In addition to his oratory skills, Mumford began to hone his leadership skills in the society and over his undergraduate career eventually became president of the Hesperian Society. Outside of the society, Mumford participated in the Physics Club, Phi Beta Kappa, and acted in two dramatic productions on top of working in the library as a student assistant. He graduated magna cum laude in 1925. Mumford was offered a full-time position with the library and he accepted so that he could continue to work towards a master's degree that would help with his dreams of a teaching career. Mumford completed his Master's in English in the spring of 1928, but was at this point persuaded by assistant librarian, Louis T. Ibbotson, to go back to school and get a Bachelor of Library Science degree at the School of Library Science, Columbia University, New York. In the fall of 1928, Mumford entered the School of Library Science where he was able to work part-time in the library proper while completing his education. In the spring of 1929, he was offered a position with the New York Public Library (NYPL) as a reference assistant. Shortly afterwards, Mumford met Permelia Catherine Stevens, a children's librarian for the NYPL system, and they were married on October 4, 1930 and had one child, a daughter, Katheryn Mumford. Mumford spent 16 years with the New York Public Library. Starting as a reference assistant, he soon rose to take on more administrative duties. Advancing from reference to general administrative assistant, he then became chief of the cataloguing division. After a short loan to the Library of Congress where he overhauled their processing department, he returned to take up duties as the chief of preparations and ended up as the coordinator of general public services before he left in 1945 to join the Cleveland Public Library system (CPL). Mumford spent five years as assistant director of the CPL and became director in 1950. He was director until 1954 when he took on the helm of Librarian of Congress. His time spent at the CPL can be marked by improved growth (financially and physically) and increased public awareness and support. In addition to his duties at the NYPL and CPL, Mumford joined the American Library Association in 1932 and became increasingly active in the association. His efforts with various ALA committees and his work with the Film Council of America and the Great Books Foundation led to his nomination and selection as President of the American Library Association in 1954. His inaugural address to ALA clearly speaks of his commitment to Library Service: > The task ahead is to offer the opportunity for continuing education through > life, to enlarge the means of access to books through an ever-broadening > pattern of facilities and services. The task ahead is to provide the > materials and resources of education for better living, to help people to > become more proficient in their chosen fields of work, balanced and enriched > in their private lives, to the end that they may bring their skills and > humanity to the service of society as a whole. > We should not lose sight of the fact that maintaining man's right to > knowledge and freedom to choose his reading is an empty achievement if we do > not make available to him the material from which he can select and choose > ... Freedom to read is an academic right, important as a principle, but > meaningless in effect unless library resources are made available to those > who lack them. Mumford spent a year as ALA President and during this time helped to streamline management of the association and oversaw the establishment of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for substantial and lasting contributions to literature for children. Two months after Mumford's inauguration as president of the ALA, he began his 20-year tenure as the first professionally trained Librarian of Congress. Mumford was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 22, 1954 and was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1954. He was sworn into office using the 1782 Aiken Bible (the first complete bible printed in English in the independent United States) and officially began his first day on September 1, 1954. The years prior to Mumford's appointment reveal hampered library relationships with the United States Congress; appropriations were down and Congress felt that the Library of Congress was no longer serving its needs. In addition, new information and technology were placing ever- growing demands on the services of the library. As Librarian of Congress, Mumford was able to use his oratorical skills to repair vital relationships, rebuild Congressional confidence in the library and gain much needed appropriations to improve functions and programming. During the first ten years of his appointment appropriations more than doubled, the case for more space (a new building) was developed and put before the Joint Committee on the Library, work was started in the development of cataloging in publication and research was completed on machine-readable cataloging systems; Public Law 480 was established and helped bring about international cataloging standards. In his personal life, Mumford's wife, Permelia died in 1961. Mumford later married Mrs. Betsy Perrin Fox on November 28, 1969. During the last half of his Librarianship, Mumford saw much of his effort and many of the programs he had implemented come to fruition. The most notable being the construction of the James Madison Memorial Building that was started in 1971 and completed in 1980. Other achievements include a ninefold total increase in appropriations, the establishment of the National Program for Acquisitions and Cataloging (NPAC), completion and distribution of the Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) system, an increase in services for handicapped readers, expansion of legislative research into the more dedicated Congressional Research Service, final publication of the Pre-1956 National Union Catalog, completion of the Presidential Papers Program, development of preservation programs and the establishment of the Preservation Research Laboratory, the expansion of motion picture programs, the addition of an African section and a Children's Book section, development of National Referral Center for Science and Technology, the establishment of the American Revolution Bicentennial Office and the development of the Affirmative Action Plan that provided for equality, training and scholarship of Library of Congress staff.

The training focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure. The training takes into account the number of repetitions, the amount of weight, and the amount of time the muscle is exposed to tension in order to maximize the amount of muscle fiber recruitment. Principles The fundamental principles of high-intensity training (HIT) are that exercise should be brief, infrequent, and intense. Exercises are performed with a high level of effort, or intensity, where it is thought that it will stimulate the body to produce an increase in muscular strength and size. Advocates of HIT believe that this method is superior for strength and size building to most other methods which, for example, may stress lower weights with larger volume (sets x reps). As strength increases, HIT techniques will have the weight/resistance increased progressively where it is thought that it will provide the muscles with adequate overload to stimulate further improvements. There is an inverse relationship between how intensely and how long one can exercise. As a result, high-intensity workouts are generally kept brief. After a high-intensity workout, as with any workout, the body requires time to recover and produce the responses stimulated during the workout, so there is more emphasis on rest and recovery in the HIT philosophy than in most other weight training methods. In any workout, not just HIT, training schedules should allow adequate time between workouts for recovery (and adaptation). While many typical HIT programs comprise a single-set per exercise, tri- weekly, full-body workout, many variations exist in specific recommendations of set and exercise number, workout routines, volume and frequency of training. The common thread is an emphasis on a high level of effort, relatively brief and infrequent (i.e. not daily) training, and the cadence of a lift, which will be very slow compared to a non-HIT weight training routine. Most HIT advocates stress the use of controlled lifting speeds and strict form, with special attention paid to avoiding any bouncing, jerking, or yanking of the weight or machine movement arm during exercise. Technical HIT advice varies from lifting the weights smoothly and at a natural pace, to timing the lifts, peaking at hold and descent. In extreme cases, it may take up to 30 seconds to complete a single repetition. Also emphasized when near exhaustion in order to further exhaust the muscle or muscles exercised: doing static holds for periods of time, and negative reps (lowering the weight). This will stimulate further growth and strength because muscles are weakest in positive/contracting movements (sometimes referred to as first stage failure of a muscle). Although you may not be able to lift a weight for another rep you will almost certainly be able to hold it statically for a further period (second stage of failure) and finally lower a weight at a slow controlled speed (third stage of failure). Until all three (lifting, holding and lowering) parts of an exercise can no longer be completed in a controlled manner a muscle cannot be considered thoroughly exhausted/exercised . Antecedents and Controversies A large number of skeptics dispute the methods and results claimed by HIT advocates. Some of the criticism asserts that HIT violates much conventional \\"wisdom\\" in weight training. By always using a weight that one can lift 8-12 times, using 4 second negatives, and so on, it has flown in the face of the exercise establishment. There exists also an issue related to the development of HIT and its originality. Near the close of the 19th century, a medical doctor by the name of Gustav Zander developed a complete set of machines and a workout method remarkably close to that promoted by inventor and HIT enthusiast Arthur Jones in the early 1970s. Jones acknowledged Zander stating: > So, in attempts to improve my exercise results, I designed and built a total > of about twenty very sophisticated exercise machines, then believing that > these were the first exercise machines ever built by anybody. But many years > later, I learned that a doctor named Gustav Zander had designed and built a > number of exercise machines in Europe nearly a hundred years before I built > my first one; I did not copy Zander's work and learned nothing from him, was > not even aware of his work until long after I had made the same discoveries > that he had made. But if I had known about, and understood, Zander's work, > it would have saved me a lot of time and a rather large fortune in money, > because the man was a genius; his only problem was that he lived about a > century ahead of his time, at a time when very few people cared about > exercise and even fewer knew anything about it. Regardless of who originally developed the systems (and machines) it is clear that through Arthur Jones and his company and a crew of HIT advocates, the principles and concepts of HIT became popularized. HIT and other training routines A 350px HIT will target a single body part with one or two exercises, and generally a single set of 6-10 reps for upper body exercises and either 8-15 or more commonly 12-20 reps for lower body exercises, done to momentary muscular failure. Deadlifts usually have a rep range of 1-5 reps. Cadence for a HIT workout is supposed to be smooth, but not always Super Slow. A standard HIT cadence is usually 3-1-4-1. For clarity, here are two examples of how the cadence would be for an exercise. On the Lat Pulldown exercise the cadence is as follows: 3 seconds pulling down (Positive movement), followed by a 1-second pause & squeeze (at full contraction), followed by a 4-second return (Negative movement), followed by a 1-second rest. This completes 1 rep. On the Barbell Squat the cadence is as follows: 4 seconds lowering the bar (the Negative movement), followed by a 1-second pause (at the bottom), followed by 3 seconds raising up the bar (the Positive movement), followed by a 1-second rest at the top. This completes 1 rep. HIT stresses intensity over repetition. Many weightlifters will use a HIT routine to help break a 'plateau' - meaning they will use HIT temporarily when another routine stops giving desired results. Some HIT trainees will use HIT exclusively as well - Arthur Jones believed HIT was all that was required. Different strength training authors from Ellington Darden and Mike Mentzer to Dorian Yates and Gordon LaVelle have called their system HIT, with each individual having credited Arthur Jones for the formulation of its basic tenet principles. However, there has never been a clear and consistent guideline on how to utilize HIT. Darden advocated full body routines, while Yates recommended to split the workouts into four different sessions a week. Mentzer believed that no more than one set to muscular failure per body part was all that was required,High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way yet Yates and LaVelle believed that more than one exercise per body part is necessary to get complete development as a bodybuilder. Rest-pause A former Mr. Universe, the late Mike Mentzer achieved his lifetime best condition from performing rest-pause, an old system of lifting involving single-rep maxima interspersed with brief (10 second) rest periods. Rest-pause has the advantages of old- school power training while also allowing for enough overall reps to be performed for hypertrophy and cardiovascular exercise purposes.

It is a satire on Russian literature starring Allen and Diane Keaton as Boris and Sonja, Russians living during the Napoleonic Era who engage in mock-serious philosophical debates. Allen considered it the funniest film he had made up until that point. Plot When Napoleon (James Tolkan) invades Austria during the Napoleonic Wars, Boris Grushenko (Woody Allen), a coward and pacifist scholar, is forced to enlist in the Russian army. Desperate and disappointed after hearing the news that Sonja (Diane Keaton), his cousin twice removed, is to wed a herring merchant, he inadvertently becomes a war hero. Boris returns and marries the recently widowed Sonja, who does not want to marry him, but promises him that she will, in order to make him happy for one night, when she thinks that he is about to be killed in a duel. To her surprise and disappointment, he survives the duel. Their marriage is filled with philosophical debates but no money. Their life together is interrupted when Napoleon invades the Russian Empire. Boris wants to flee but his wife, angered that the invasion will interfere with their plans to start a family that year, conceives a plot to assassinate Napoleon at his headquarters in Moscow. Boris and Sonja debate the matter with some degree of philosophical doublespeak, and Boris reluctantly goes along with it. They fail to kill Napoleon and Sonja escapes arrest while Boris is executed, despite being told by a vision that he will be pardoned. Boris' ghost bids goodbye to Sonja and the audience before dancing away with Death.

Leveque * Aubrey Morris as Soldier 4 * Alfred Lutter as Young Boris * Georges Adet as Old Nehamkin * Sol Frieder as Voskovec * Lloyd Battista as Don Francisco * Frank Adu as Drill Sergeant Production Allen shot the film in France and Hungary, where he had to deal with bad weather, spoiled negatives, food poisoning, physical injuries and communication difficulties. This made the director swear never to shoot a movie outside the United States again. However, starting in 1996 with Everyone Says I Love You, Allen did in fact shoot a number of films abroad. Style Coming between Allen's Sleeper and Annie Hall, Love and Death is in many respects an artistic transition between the two. Allen pays tribute to the humor of The Marx Brothers, Bob Hope and Charlie Chaplin throughout the film. The dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot and War and Peace. This includes a dialogue between Boris and his father in which each line alludes to, or is composed entirely of, Dostoyevsky titles. The use of Prokofiev on the soundtrack adds to the Russian flavor of the film. Prokofiev's \\"Troika\\" from the Lieutenant Kij√© Suite is featured prominently, for the film's opening and closing credits and in selected scenes in the film when a \\"bouncy\\" theme is required. The battle scene is accompanied with music from Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky cantata. Boris is marched to his execution to the \\"March\\" from Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges. Some of the humor is straightforward; other jokes rely on the viewer's awareness of classic literature or contemporary European cinema. For example, the final shot of Keaton is a reference to Ingmar Bergman's Persona. The sequence with the stone lions is a parody of Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, while the Russian battle against Napoleon's army heavily parodies the same film's \\"Odessa steps\\" sequence. Bergman's The Seventh Seal is parodied several times, including during the climax. Reception The film grossed over $20 million in North America,\\"Love and Death\\" on Box Office Mojo making it the 18th highest grossing picture of 1975 in North America (theatrical rentals were $5 million).\\"All-time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976 p 48 At Rotten Tomatoes, 21 out of 21 critics--including three of the site's \\"top critics\\"--consider the film \\"fresh\\", with a 100% rating and a weighted average of 8.13/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Woody Allen plunks his neurotic persona into a Tolstoy pastiche and yields one of his funniest films, brimming with slapstick ingenuity and a literary inquiry into subjects as momentous as Love and Death\\". At the 25th Berlin International Film Festival in 1975, the film won the Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution. Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars: > Miss Keaton is very good in Love and Death, perhaps because here she gets to > establish and develop a character, instead of just providing a foil, as > she's often done in other Allen films ... There are dozens of little moments > when their looks have to be exactly right, and they almost always are. There > are shadings of comic meaning that could have gotten lost if all we had were > the words, and there are whole scenes that play off facial expressions. It's > a good movie to watch just for that reason, because it's been done with such > care, love and lunacy. Gene Siskel awarded a full four stars and wrote, \\"Woody Allen is simply terrific in 'Love and Death.' To my mind, it's his funniest film.

It had a population of 6,961 people in the 2011 Census. Most of the settlement lies within the townland of Carryduff, although part of it extends into the neighbouring townlands of Killynure and Mealough. History One of the earliest references to the settlement dates from 1622, where its anglicised name is written as Carrow- Hugh-Duffe. The original village formed where six roads and a river crossed, and is the site of the ancient Queen's Fort Rath. The road south from Belfast (the A24) climbs out of a gap in the Castlereagh Hills, and splits at Carryduff, one fork (the A7) continuing to Downpatrick (via Saintfield and Crossgar), the other fork (A24) continuing via Ballynahinch to Newcastle towards Kilkeel. In addition, the road from the Ards Peninsula, Newtownards and Comber (the B178) crosses here en route to Hillsborough in the west. All six roads cross the small Carryduff River here (which flows northwards to eventually join the River Lagan at Minnowburn). The good road connections and proximity to Belfast made the town an ideal site for overspill development from the city in the 1960s. This period saw numerous housing developments, the construction of the Town and Country Shopping Centre, and Carryduff Primary School, leading into the 1970s with the building of the Killynure housing estate by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Development along one side of the northbound A24 took place adjacent to the Immaculate Heart of Mary Roman Catholic Church and St Joseph's Primary School, with the Knockbracken Reservoir on the other side. The 1980s saw expansion continue with Carryduff becoming a commuter town for Belfast workers. Developments continued into the 1990s and included Carryduff Library, Carryduff Shopping Centre, including shops such as Wellworths (later SuperValu) and stationery and book shop NPO (later Eason). Numerous further housing developments have been built, as well as the Lough Moss Leisure Centre. These developments saw the Carryduff River placed inside a culvert for much of its journey through the town. Very little green belt land now remains between Carryduff and the southern border of Belfast, the 1980s having seen the former Matthew Stop Line breached. The local Carryduff Gaelic Athletic Club is based at Pairc Aodha Dhuibh. Carryduff also has 2 local men's football teams who all play from Lough Moss pitches in the town, they are Carryduff Carryduff Colts F.C. and Carryduff Athletic F.C. In 2018, the disused Knockbracken reservoir has become Ireland's largest aqua park, offering a range of water based activities. Demography The population of Carryduff on Census day (27 March 2011) was 6,961 people. Of these: * 21.45% were aged under 16 years and 13.92% were aged 65 years and over * the mean age was 38 years * 47.55% of the population were male and 52.45% were female * 49.55% were from a Catholic background and 42.44% were from a Protestant or Other Christian (including Christian related) background See also *List of localities in Northern Ireland by population References Category:Towns in County Down Category:Civil parish of Drumbo ","title":"Carryduff"},{"id":"917380","text":"Shane Murphy may refer to: *Shane Murphy (footballer) (born 1955), Australian rules footballer *Shane Murphy (hurler) (born 1983), Cork player See also *Shayne Murphy (born 1952), Australian politician ","title":"Shane Murphy"},{"id":"917381","text":"Kashmir mainly refers to the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent claimed by China, India, and Pakistan.

Opened in 1860, it became the preeminent music theatre of late 19th-century Russia, where many of the stage masterpieces of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky- Korsakov received their premieres. Through most of the Soviet era, it was known as the Kirov Theatre. Today, the Mariinsky Theatre is home to the Mariinsky Ballet, Mariinsky Opera and Mariinsky Orchestra. Since Yuri Temirkanov's retirement in 1988, the conductor Valery Gergiev has served as the theatre's general director. Name The theatre is named after Empress Maria Alexandrovna, wife of Tsar Alexander II. There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance foyer. The theatre's name has changed throughout its history, reflecting the political climate of the time: * 1860 ‚Äì 1920: Imperial Mariinsky Theatre () * 1920 ‚Äì 1924: State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet () * 1924 ‚Äì 1935: Leningrad State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet () * 1935 ‚Äì 1992: Kirov State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet () (one of numerous places and institutions named or renamed at that time for Sergei Kirov) * 1992 ‚Äì present: State Academic Mariinsky Theatre () Note: The acronym \\"GATOB\\" (Gosudarstvenn√Øy Akademicheskiy Teatr Oper√Ø i Baleta) is often encountered in historical accounts. The theatre building is commonly called the Mariinsky Theatre. The companies that operate within it have for brand recognition purposes retained the Kirov name, acquired during the Soviet era to commemorate the assassinated Leningrad Communist Party leader Sergey Kirov (1886‚Äì1934). Origins Design for the Imperial-era curtain of the Mariinsky Theatre that existed prior to 1914 The Imperial drama, opera and ballet troupe in Saint Petersburg was established in 1783, at the behest of Catherine the Great, although an Italian ballet troupe had performed at the Russian court since the early 18th century. Originally, the ballet and opera performances were given in the wooden Karl Knipper Theatre on Tsaritsa Meadow, near the present-day Tripartite Bridge (also known as the Little Theatre or the Maly Theatre). The Hermitage Theatre, next door to the Winter Palace, was used to host performances for an elite audience of aristocratic guests invited by the Empress. A permanent theatre building for the new company of opera and ballet artists was designed by Antonio Rinaldi and opened in 1783. Known as the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre the structure was situated on Carousel Square, which was renamed Theatre Square in honour of the building. Both names \\"Kamenny\\" (Russian word for \\"stone\\") and \\"Bolshoi\\" (Russian word for \\"big\\") were coined to distinguish it from the wooden Little Theatre. In 1836, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was renovated to a design by Albert Cavos (son of Catterino Cavos, an opera composer), and served as the principal theatre of the Imperial Ballet and opera. On 29 January 1849, the Equestrian circus (–ö–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ü–∏—Ä–∫) opened on Theatre Square. This was also the work of the architect Cavos. The building was designed to double as a theatre. It was a wooden structure in the then-fashionable neo-Byzantine style. Ten years later, when this circus burnt down, Albert Cavos rebuilt it as an opera and ballet house with the largest stage in the world. With a seating capacity of 1,625 and a U-shaped Italian-style auditorium, the theatre opened on 2 October 1860, with a performance of A Life for the Tsar. The new theatre was named Mariinsky after its imperial patroness, Empress Maria Alexandrovna. Leading role Aleksandr Golovin's luxury curtain of 1914 The Imperial Mariinsky Theatre and its predecessor, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, hosted the premieres of many of the operas of Mikhail Glinka, Modest Mussorgsky, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. At the behest of the theatre director Ivan Vsevolozhsky, both the Imperial Ballet (ballet arrived at the Mariinsky theater in 1870) and the Imperial Opera were relocated to the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, as the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was considered unsafe. It was there that the renowned choreographer Marius Petipa presented many of his masterpieces, including such staples of the ballet repertory as The Sleeping Beauty in 1890, The Nutcracker in 1892, Raymonda in 1898, and the definitive revival of Swan Lake (with Lev Ivanov) in 1895. When the theatre was designated as principal venue of the Imperial Ballet and Opera in 1886, the theatre was extensively renovated. A lavish inauguration celebration was given at the behest of Emperor Alexander III, in which the first original ballet to be produced at the Mariinsky was given Petipa's Les Pilules magiques, to the music of Ludwig Minkus. Other world premieres given at the house included Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov in 1874, Tchaikovsky's operas The Queen of Spades in 1890 and Iolanta in 1892, the revised version of Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet in 1940, and Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus in 1956. Other notable productions included Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Golden Cockerel in 1909 and Prokofiev's ballet Cinderella in 1946 (with Natalya Dudinskaya). The imperial and Soviet theater was the home of numerous great impresarios, conductors, and musicians. Conductors: Mikhail Zhukov (1932‚Äì35), Israel Chudnovsky and others. Ballet: The ballet school of the Mariinsky Theatre spawned the careers of artists Mathilde Kschessinskaya, Olga Preobrajenskaya, Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky, and George Balanchine, students of the Imperial Ballet School and style, and, under and after the teachings of Agrippina Vaganova, artists Marina Semyonova, Galina Ulanova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Irina Kolpakova, Galina Mezentseva, Altynai Asylmuratova, as well as more recent dancers of renown Ulyana Lopatkina, Diana Vishneva, and Svetlana Zakharova, students of the school as now named, the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet. The Mariinsky Theatre today Although this box was not officially referred to as the \\"Tsar's Box\\", this box is where the Emperor and his family always sat when attending performances at the theatre. Under Yuri Temirkanov, Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988, the Opera Company continued to stage innovative productions of both modern and classic Russian operas. Although functioning separately from the Theatre's Ballet Company, since 1988 both companies have been under the artistic leadership of Valery Gergiev as Artistic Director of the entire Theatre. The Opera Company has entered a new era of artistic excellence and creativity. Since 1993, Gergiev's impact on opera there has been enormous. Firstly, he reorganized the company's operations and established links with many of the world's great opera houses, including the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera, the Op√©ra Bastille, La Scala, La Fenice, the Israeli Opera, the Washington National Opera and the San Francisco Opera. Today, the Opera Company regularly tours to most of these cities. Gergiev has also been innovative as far as Russian opera is concerned: in 1989, there was an all-Mussorgsky festival featuring the composer's entire operatic output. Similarly, many of Prokofiev‚Äôs operas were presented from the late 1990s. Operas by non-Russian composers began to be performed in their original languages, which helped the Opera Company to incorporate world trends. The annual international \\"Stars of the White Nights Festival\\" in Saint Petersburg, started by Gergiev in 1993, has also put the Mariinsky on the world‚Äôs cultural map. That year, as a salute to the imperial origins of the Mariinsky, Verdi's La forza del destino, which received its premiere in Saint Petersburg in 1862, was produced with its original sets, costumes and scenery. Since then, it has become a characteristic of the \\"White Nights Festival\\" to present the premieres from the company's upcoming season during this magical period, when the hours of darkness practically disappear as the summer solstice approaches. Presently, the Company lists on its roster 22 sopranos (of whom Anna Netrebko may be the best known); 13 mezzo-sopranos (with Olga Borodina familiar to US and European audiences); 23 tenors; eight baritones; and 14 basses. With Gergiev in charge overall, there is a Head of Stage Administration, a Stage Director, Stage Managers and Assistants, along with 14 accompanists. =Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall= The nearby Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall, designed by French architect, Xavier Fabre, opened in spring 2007.

Construction began in 2003, following a different design by French architect Jean Nouvel that was halted at the sub-basement level. The new design team took over in 2009. The completion of Mariinsky II was predicted to result in Saint Petersburg's equivalent of New York City's Lincoln Center.

She trained on the River Dee. She first won silver at Sydney in 2000 in the woman's quadruple sculls with Guin Batten, Gillian Lindsay and Miriam Batten losing to a German team. Four years later in Athens in 2004, she won silver again when she took part in the coxless pairs with Cath Bishop, losing to Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu of Romania. She returned to the quadruple sculls in Beijing 2008, when she won her third silver with Annabel Vernon, Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton, narrowly losing to China after taking the lead for some of the race. On 3 August 2012, she won an Olympic gold medal at London in the double sculls with Anna Watkins. At the 2016 Olympics, she won a silver medal in double sculls with Vicky Thornley. Grainger has won eight medals at the World Championships. The first of these was a bronze in 1997 in the eight, then a gold with Bishop in 2003, a gold in 2005 with the quadruple scull, with Houghton, Sarah Winckless, and Rebecca Romero, and in 2006 her quadruple scull was promoted to gold following a drugs test on the winning Russian crew. This quad had Debbie Flood instead of Romero, who had retired after the 2005 world championships. Another gold came in 2007, again in the quadruple sculls, with Annabel Vernon replacing the injured Sarah Winckless. In 2009, having switched to the single scull after the Beijing Olympics, Grainger claimed a surprise silver at the World Championships in Poland. In 2010, Grainger teamed up with Anna Watkins in the double sculls and they embarked on an unbeaten season, culminating in victory in November in the World Championships in Lake Karapiro, New Zealand, and then defending the title in an injury disrupted season in 2011 in Bled, Slovenia.

It is commonly encountered as the dodecahydrate, KAl(SO4)2¬∑12H2O. It crystallizes in an octahedral structure in neutral solution and cubic structure in an alkali solution with space group P a -3 and lattice parameter of 12.18 √Ö. The compound is the most important member of the generic class of compounds called alums, and is often called simply alum. Potassium alum is commonly used in water purification, leather tanning, dyeing, fireproof textiles, and baking powder as E number E522. It also has cosmetic uses as a deodorant, as an aftershave treatment and as a styptic for minor bleeding from shaving.Alum Block for Shaving ‚Äì When and How to use one., Blake'n Blade Shave Shop. Last accessed 15 January 2020. History =In antiquity= Potassium alum was known to the Ancient Egyptians, who obtained it from evaporites in the Western desert and reportedly used it as early as 1500 BCE to reduce the visible cloudiness (turbidity) in the water. Potassium alum was described under the name alumen or salsugoterrae by Pliny,Alumen, and the Several Varieties of it; Thirty-eight Remedies., Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, book 35, chapter 52; on the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University. Last accessed 27 December 2011. and it is clearly the same as the stupteria described by Dioscorides.Dioscorides, book 5, chapter 123. However, the name alum and other names applied to this substance ‚Äî like misy, sory, chalcanthum, and atramentum sutorium ‚Äî were often applied to other products with vaguely similar properties or uses, such as iron sulfate or \\"green vitriol\\". The production of potassium alum from alunite is archaeologically attested on the island Lesbos.A. Archontidou 2005, \\"Un atelier de preparation de l'alun a partir de l'alunite dans l'isle de Lesbos\\" in L'alun de Mediterran√©e. ed P. Borgard et al. This site was abandoned in the 7th century but dates back at least to the 2nd century CE. Potassium alum is mentioned in the Ayurveda with the name phitkari or saurashtri. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine with the name mingfan (ÊòéÁüæ). =In the middle and modern ages= Potassium alum was imported into England mainly from the Middle East, and, from the late 15th century onwards, the Papal States for hundreds of years. Its use there was as a dye-fixer (mordant) for wool (which was one of England's primary industries, the value of which increased significantly if dyed). These sources were unreliable, however, and there was a push to develop a source in England especially as imports from the Papal States were ceased following the excommunication of Henry VIII. Historically, potassium alum was used extensively in the wool industrySee Henry VII of England trade section. Henry broke the Pope's monopoly by financing shipping bootstrapping a trading system with the Ottoman Empires mines from Classical antiquity, during the Middle Ages, and well into 19th century as a mordant or dye fixative in the process of turning wool into dyed bolts of cloth. In the 13th and 14th centuries, alum (from alunite) was a major import from Phocaea (Gulf of Smyrna in Byzantium) by Genoans and Venetians (and was a cause of war between Genoa and Venice) and later by Florence. After the fall of Constantinople, alunite (the source of alum) was discovered at Tolfa in the Papal States (1461). The textile dyeing industry in Bruge, and many other locations in Italy, and later in England, required alum to stabilize the dyes onto the fabric (make the dyes \\"fast\\") and also to brighten the colors.\\"Color in Relation to the Political and Economic History of the Western World\\" by Sidney M Edelstein, Proceedings of the Perkin Centennial, American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, September, 1956\\"Worldly Goods: A New History of the Renaissance\\", Lisa Jardine, 1996, Norton&Co;, pages 114-116 With state financing, attempts were made throughout the 16th century, but without success until early on in the 17th century. An industry was founded in Yorkshire to process the shale, which contained the key ingredient, aluminium sulfate, and made an important contribution to the Industrial Revolution. One of the oldest historic sites for the production of alum from shale and human urine are the Peak alum works in Ravenscar, North Yorkshire. By the 18th century, the landscape of northeast Yorkshire had been devastated by this process, which involved constructing stacks of burning shale and fuelling them with firewood continuously for months. The rest of the production process consisted of quarrying, extraction, steeping of shale ash with seaweed in urine, boiling, evaporating, crystallisation, milling and loading into sacks for export. Quarrying ate into the cliffs of the area, the forests were felled for charcoal and the land polluted by sulfuric acid and ash. =Identification of the formula= In the early 1700s, Georg Ernst Stahl claimed that reacting sulfuric acid with limestone produced a sort of alum.George Ernst Stahl (1703), Specimen Beccherianum. Johann Ludwig Gleditsch, Leipzig.George Ernst Stahl (1723), Ausf√ºhrliche Betrachtung und zul√§nglicher Beweiss von den Saltzen, da√ü diesselbe aus einer zarten Erde, mit Wasser innig verbunden, bestehen (Detailed treatment and adequate proof of salts, that they consist of a subtile earth intimately bound with water) W√§ysenhaus, Halle. The error was soon corrected by Johann Pott and Andreas Marggraf, who showed that the precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum, namely alumina, is quite different from lime and chalk, and is one of the ingredients in common clay.Johann Heinrich Pott (1746), Chymische Untersuchungen, welche f√ºrnehmlich von der Lithogeognosia oder Erk√§ntni√ü und Bearbeitung der gemeinen einfacheren Steine und Erden ingleichen von Feuer und Licht handeln, volume 1, p. 32.Andreas Sigismund Marggraf (1754), \\"Exp√©riences faites sur la terre d'alun\\" (Experiments made on the earth of alum), M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin, pp. 41-66. Marggraf also showed that perfect crystals with properties of alum can be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulfuric acid and adding potash or ammonia to the concentrated solution.Marggraf (1754) \\"Exp√©riences qui concernent la r√©g√©n√©ration de l'alun de sa propre terre, l'apr√®s avoir s√©par√© par l'acide vitriolique ; avec quelques compositions artificielles de l'alun par moyen d'autres terres, et dudit acide\\". M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin, pp. 31-40. In 1767, Torbern Bergman observed the need for potassium or ammonium sulfates to convert aluminium sulfate into alum, while sodium or calcium would not work.Torbern Bergman (1767), \\"IX. De confectione Aluminis\\". In Opuscula physica et chemica, I. G. M√ºller, Leipzig, 1788), volume 1, pp. 306-307. At the time, potassium (\\"potash\\") was believed to be exclusively found on plants. However, in 1797, Martin Klaproth discovered the presence of potassium in the minerals leucite and lepidolite.Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1797), Beitr√§ge zur Chemischen Kenntniss Der Mineralk√∂rper (Contributions to [our] chemical knowledge of mineral substances). Decker and Co., Posen, and Heinrich August Rottmann, Berlin; pp. 45-46 and p. 193.Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1801), Analytical Essays Towards Promoting the Chemical Knowledge of Mineral Substances. T. Cadell, Jr. & W. Davies, London. His finding of potassium in leucite appears on [https://archive.org/stream/analyticalessay01klapgoog#page/n374/mode/2up pp. 353-354.: \\"On the contrary, I was surprised in an unexpected manner, by discovering in it another constituent part, consisting of a substance, the existence of which, certainly, no one person would have conjectured within the limits of the mineral kingdom ‚Ä¶ This constituent part of leucite ‚Ä¶ is no other than pot-ash, which, hitherto, has been thought exclusively to belong to the vegetable kingdom, and has, on this account, been called VEGETABLE ALKALI. ‚Äî This discovery, which I think of great importance, cannot fail to occasion considerable changes in the systems of natural history, ‚Ä¶ .\\". The discovery of potassium in lepidolite is mentioned on p. 472. Louis Vauquelin then conjectured that potassium was likewise an ingredient in many other minerals. Given Marggraf and Bergman's experiments, he suspected that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient of natural alum. In 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash.Vauquelin (1797), \\"Sur la nature de l'Alun du commerce, sur l'existence de la potasse dans ce sel, et sur diverses combinaisons simples ou triples de l'alumine avec l'acide sulfurique\\" (On the nature of commercial alum, on the existence of potash in this salt, and on various simple or triple compounds of alumina with sulfuric acid). In Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1st series, volume 22, pages 258-279. In the same journal volume, Jean-Antoine Chaptall published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum and alum manufactured by himself,Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1797), \\"Compar√©e des quatre principales sortes d'Alun connues dans le commerce; et Observations sur leur nature et leur usage\\" (Comparison of the four main types of commercial alum; and observations on their nature and use). In Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1st series, volume 22, pages 280-296. confirming Vauquelin's results. Characteristics Octahedral potassium alum crystal with unequal distribution of the face area Potassium alum crystallizes in regular octahedra with flattened corners and is very soluble in water. The solution is slightly acidic and is astringent to the taste. Neutralizing a solution of alum with potassium hydroxide will begin to cause the separation of alumina . When heated to nearly a red heat, it gives a porous, friable mass, which is known as \\"burnt alum\\". It fuses at in its own water of crystallization. Natural occurrence Potassium alum dodecahydrate occurs in nature as a sulfate mineral called alum-(K), typically as encrustations on rocks in areas of weathering and oxidation of sulfide minerals and potassium-bearing minerals. In the past, potassium alum has been obtained from alunite (), mined from sulfur-containing volcanic sediments.Bottomley (2010) p. 35. Alunite is an associate and likely potassium and aluminium source. It has been reported at Vesuvius, Italy; east of Springsure, Queensland; in Alum Cave, Tennessee; Alum Gulch, Santa Cruz County, Arizona and the Philippine island of Cebu. In order to obtain alum from alunite, it is calcined and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The undecahydrate also occurs as the fibrous mineral kalinite (). Industrial production Potassium alum historically was mainly extracted from alunite. Potassium alum is now produced industrially by adding potassium sulfate to a concentrated solution of aluminium sulfate.Otto Helmboldt, L. Keith Hudson, Chanakya Misra, Karl Wefers, Wolfgang Heck, Hans Stark, Max Danner, Norbert R√∂sch \\"Aluminium Compounds, Inorganic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. The aluminium sulfate is usually obtained by treating minerals like alum schist, bauxite and cryolite with sulfuric acid. If much iron should be present in the sulfate then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate. Uses =Medicine and cosmetics= An alum block sold as an astringent in pharmacies in India (where it is widely known as Fitkiri (Bengali), Fitkari (Hindi) or Phitkari (Urdu) Potassium alum is used in medicine mainly as an astringent (or styptic) and antiseptic. Styptic pencils are rods composed of potassium alum or aluminum sulfate, used topically to reduce bleeding in minor cuts (especially from shaving) and abrasions, nosebleeds, and hemorrhoids, and to relieve pain from stings and bites. Potassium alum blocks were rubbed over the wet skin after shaving. Potassium alum was also used topically to remove pimples and acne, and to cauterize aphthous ulcers in the mouth and canker sores, as it has a significant drying effect to the area and reduces the irritation felt at the site.. It has been used to stop bleeding in cases of hemorrhagic cystitis. and is used in some countries as a cure for hyperhidrosis. It is used in dentistry (especially in gingival retraction cords) because of its astringent and hemostatic properties. Potassium and ammonium alum are the active ingredients in some antiperspirants and deodorants, acting by inhibiting the growth of the bacteria responsible for body odor. Alum's antiperspirant and antibacterial properties contribute to its traditional use as an underarm deodorant. It has been used for this purpose in Europe, Mexico, Thailand (where it is called sarn-som), throughout Asia and in the Philippines (where it is called tawas). Today, potassium or ammonium alum is sold commercially for this purpose as a \\"deodorant crystal\\". Beginning in 2005 the US Food and Drug Administration no longer recognized it as a wetness reducer, however it is still available and used in several other countries, primarily in Asia. Potassium alum was the major adjuvant used to increase the efficacy of vaccines, and has been used since the 1920s. But it has been almost completely replaced by aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate in commercial vaccines. Alum may be used in depilatory waxes used for the removal of body hair or applied to freshly waxed skin as a soothing agent. In the 1950s, men sporting crewcut or flattop hairstyles sometimes applied alum to their hair, as an alternative to pomade, to keep the hair standing up. =Culinary= Potassium alum may be an acidic ingredient of baking powder to provide a second leavening phase at high temperatures (although sodium alum is more commonly used for that purpose. Alum was used by bakers in England during the 1800s to make bread whiter. This was theorized by some, including John Snow, to cause rickets. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 prevented this and other adulterations. Potassium alum, under the name \\"alum powder\\", is found in the spice section of many grocery stores in the US. Its chief culinary use is in pickling recipes, to preserve and add crispness to fruit and vegetables. =Flame retardant= Potassium alum is used as a fire retardant to render cloth, wood, and paper materials less flammable. =Tanning= Potassium alum is used in leather tanning, in order to remove moisture from the hide and prevent rotting. Unlike tannic acid, alum doesn't bind to the hide and can be washed out of it. =Dyeing= Alum has been used since antiquity as mordant to form a permanent bond between dye and natural textile fibers like wool. It is also used for this purpose in paper marbling. =Chemical flocculant= Potassium alum has been used since remote antiquity for purification of turbid liquids. It is still widely used in the purification of water for drinking and industrial processes water, treatment of effluents and post-storm treatment of lakes to precipitate contaminants. Between 30 and 40 ppm of alum for household wastewater, often more for industrial wastewater, is added to the water so that the negatively charged colloidal particles clump together into \\"flocs\\", which then float to the top of the liquid, settle to the bottom of the liquid, or can be more easily filtered from the liquid, prior to further filtration and disinfection of the water. Like other similar salts, it works by neutralizing the electrical double layer surrounding very fine suspended particles, allowing them to join into flocs. The same principle is exploited when using alum to increase the viscosity of a ceramic glaze suspension; this makes the glaze more readily adherent and slows its rate of sedimentation. =Lake pigments= Aluminum hydroxide from potassium alum serves as a base for the majority of lake pigments. =Dissolving iron and steel= Alum solution has the property of dissolving steels while not affecting aluminium or base metals. Alum solution can be used to dissolve steel tool bits that have become lodged in machined castings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqZYgReuywM AvE demonstrates use of alum to remove a broken stud from an aluminium engine head =Other= In traditional Japanese art, alum and animal glue were dissolved in water, forming a liquid known as dousa (:ja:Á§¨Ê∞¥), and used as an undercoat for paper sizing. Alum is an ingredient in some recipes for homemade modeling compounds intended for use by children. These are often called \\"play clay\\" or \\"play dough\\" for their similarity to \\"Play-Doh\\". Potassium alum was formerly used as a hardener for photographic emulsions (films and papers), usually as part of the fixer. It has now been replaced in that use by other chemicals.

Reports found there was a lack of communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of the accident saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt years later. In 2005, both Railtrack and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws. Accident A Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) InterCity 225 train bound for Leeds had left London King's Cross at 12:10, and was travelling along the East Coast Main Line at approximately when it derailed south of Hatfield station at 12:23. The train was in the control of an experienced driver trainer accompanied by a trainee driver. It had been agreed at Kings Cross that the trainee would drive the 12:10 service to Leeds. The primary cause of the accident was later determined to be the left-hand rail fracturing as the train passed over it. The train travelled a further after derailment. The leading locomotive and the first two coaches remained upright and on the rails. All of the following coaches and the trailing Driving Van Trailer (DVT) were derailed, and the train set separated into three sections. The restaurant coach, the eighth vehicle in the set, overturned onto its side and struck an overhead line gantry after derailing, resulting in severe damage to the vehicle. The whole incident occurred in 17seconds. Four passengers died in the accident and a further 33 were initially reported as injured, three seriously. The number of injured was later revised to over 70. Those who died were all in the restaurant coach: * Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand * Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex * Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire * Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds Two of those seriously injured were GNER staff working in the restaurant coach at the time of the accident. Emmerdale actress Anna Brecon was travelling on the train, and suffered minor cuts and bruises. Another passenger was the television reporter Justin Rowlatt, who said he \\"watched the carriages skid and whip around on the gravel besides the track\\". Crash investigators found the British Rail-designed Mark 4 coaches had good structural integrity and, aside from the restaurant coach, remained intact after the accident. Coincidentally, the locomotive in the crash was also involved in the Great Heck rail crash (where the leading DVT hit a road vehicle on the track) four months later. Cause A preliminary investigation found a rail had fragmented as trains passed and that the likely cause was \\"rolling contact fatigue\\" (defined as multiple surface-breaking cracks). Such cracks are caused by high loads where the wheels contact the rail. Repeated high loading causes fatigue cracks to grow. When they reach a critical size, the rail fails. Portions of the failed track at Hatfield were reassembled and numerous fatigue cracks were identified. They contributed to the spalling of the running surface to around deep and long. The problem was known about before the accident; a letter from the infrastructure company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification was insufficient to guard against this type of fatigue. Replacement rails were made available but never delivered to the correct location for installation. Since privatisation, Railtrack had divested the engineering knowledge of British Rail to contractors. While it had comprehensive maintenance procedures that might have prevented the accident if followed appropriately, later investigation showed there was a serious problem with the experience and working knowledge of staff. In a subsequent interview, the Zone Quality Standards Manager said, \\"I do not have knowledge of railway engineering nor railway safety\\", which was completely contrary to the written requirements for the role. In May 1999, the Head of Track had said that insufficiently-skilled work was causing more rails to break. Railtrack did not know how many other cases of rail fatigue around the network could lead to a Hatfield-like accident. It consequently imposed over 1,800 emergency speed restrictions and instigated a costly nationwide track replacement programme. The company was subject to \\"enforcement\\" by the Rail Regulator, Tom Winsor. Aftermath In 2004, Arthur's widow was awarded ¬£1million damages in the High Court. The families of the other three fatal casualties received damages out of court. A memorial service was held for the victims on the tenth anniversary of the crash in 2010 at St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield. A second service was held near the crash site afterwards. Both were conducted by the Rector of Hatfield, who had attended to casualties and the bereaved in the immediate aftermath of the accident in 2000. The speed restrictions and track replacement works caused significant disruption on a majority of the national network for more than a year. The disruption and Railtrack's spiralling costs eventually caused the company to enter administration at the insistence of Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, and its replacement by the not-for-dividend company Network Rail under Byers's successor Alistair Darling. Train operating companies were adversely affected by the disruption, losing an estimated 19% of revenue in the year following the crash. Freight operator EWS was cancelling up to 400 trains per week as a result, whilst estimates put Freightliner's resultant losses at ¬£1M per month. The cost to the entire UK economy of the disruption was estimated at ¬£6M per day. The Institute of Rail Welding (IoRW) was set up in 2002 by The Welding Institute (TWI) and Network Rail as a consequence of the recommendations in the investigation report. It provides a focus for individuals and organisations involved in rail welding and facilitates the adoption of best practice. The aftermath of the crash had long-reaching repercussions in the rail industry. In 2015, at the fifteenth anniversary of the accident, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said a new system for handling maintenance introduced by Network Rail was confusing, and there was the potential for a similar accident to re-occur. The union's general secretary said that Network Rail needed to act on their concerns, otherwise there would be industrial action. Court case In 2003, five managers and two companies ‚Äì Network Rail (as successors of Railtrack) and the division of Balfour Beatty that maintained the track ‚Äì were charged with manslaughter and breach of health and safety charges in connection with the accident. The managers, Anthony Walker (Balfour Beatty's rail maintenance director), Nicholas Jeffries (its civil engineer), Railtrack's Alistair Cook and Sean Fugill (asset managers for the London North-East zone), and track engineer Keith Lee, all denied the charges. The corporate manslaughter charges against Railtrack/Network Rail and some of its executives were dropped in September 2004, but the other charges stood. The trial began in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned that it could go on for a year. On 14 July, the judge instructed the jury to acquit all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on the health and safety charges, and on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined ¬£3.5M while Balfour Beatty were fined ¬£10M. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.

There were two versions, the first mounted a modified Soviet 7.62 cm gun firing German ammunition, while the other mounted the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 gun. Its high profile and thin open-topped armor provided minimal protection to the crew. Nevertheless, the Marder II (and similar Marder III) provided a great increase in firepower over contemporary German tanks during 1942 and into 1943. Only four Marder IIs remain today. History A Waffen-SS Marder II and its crew somewhere in Southern Russia during the Wehrmacht's raid into the Caucasus. The vehicle depicted is the Sd.Kfz. 132 variant, also known as a 'LaS76', based on the early Panzer II Ausf. D/E chassis mounting a captured Soviet 76 mm gun. During the first days of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans came unprepared to encounter Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV heavy tanks. Although the Wehrmacht succeeded in most operations due to superior tactics, air support and supply , the lack of anti-tank weapons capable of successfully engaging these vehicles at range was becoming evident. An urgent need arose for a mobile and powerful enough anti-tank weapon than the already existing towed anti-tank guns or tank destroyers like the Panzerj√§ger I. Among a series of solutions, it was decided to use surplus light tanks, like the Panzer II, and captured vehicles, like the Lorraine Schlepper, as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the Marder series, which were armed with either the new 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns or captured Soviet 7.62 cm F-22 Model 1936 field guns, large numbers of which had been acquired early in the war. Production The Marder II came in two major versions. The first version (Sd.Kfz. 132) was based on the light Panzer II Ausf. D/E and Flammpanzer II chassis with a new torsion bar suspension featuring four large road wheels and a \\"slack track\\" with no track return rollers. It was armed with captured Soviet 7.62 cm guns that were rebuilt to accept the larger German 7.5 cm Pak 40 propellant cartridge. This improved its penetrative capabilities and eliminated the need for captured ammunition. These early Marder IIs had a high silhouette (2.60 m high) and relatively thin armor compared to other armored vehicles; only 30 mm (front) and 10 to 15 mm (sides). There was no armour on the top or rear, leaving the crew with very little protection. Alkett built 150 Marder II (Sd. Kfz. 132) in April/May 1942 and Wegmann converted further 52 from mid 1942 to 1943. The second version (Sd.Kfz. 131) was based on new-built Panzer II Ausf. F hulls. This Marder II had a redesigned (widened) fighting compartment and used the German 75 mm Pak 40 anti-tank gun. The silhouette was lowered by about 40 cm to 2.20 m, but the armor was thin and the compartment was open to the top and rear, as in Sd. Kfz. 132. Famo (Breslau), and FAMO-Ursus produced 531 Marder II (Sd.Kfz. 131) from July 1942 to June 1943. About 130 more were converted from mid 1943 to early 1944 when the last Panzer IIs were taken out of active service. Combat history Eastern Front in 1943. The ring markings on the barrel of the gun indicate 19 claimed kills for the vehicle. A Marder II (Sd.Kfz. 131) in the USSR, 1943. The various Marder IIs produced fought on all European fronts of the war, however, there was a large concentration of these on the Eastern Front. The Marder IIs were used by the Panzerj√§ger Abteilungen of the Panzer divisions of both the Heer and the Waffen SS, as well as several Luftwaffe units. The Marders weaknesses were mainly related to survivability. The combination of a high silhouette and open-top fighting compartment made them vulnerable to indirect artillery fire, aircraft strafing, and grenades. The armor was also quite thin, making them vulnerable to enemy tanks or infantry. The Marders were not assault vehicles or tank substitutes; the open-top compartment meant operations in crowded areas such as urban environments or other close-combat situations weren't an option. They were best employed in defensive or overwatch roles. Despite their weaknesses, they were more effective than the towed antitank guns that they replaced.

Core facilities have been set up for genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics research. SIB also maintains the Vital-IT High Performance Computing Centre that provides computational resources, development support and consultancy to the Swiss life science community both in academia and industry. The Vital-IT infrastructure is distributed to three sites: University of Lausanne, EPFL and University of Geneva. Compute resources and bioinformatics expertise are also provided in the Basel area with sciCORE [BC]2, the Basel Computational Biology Center.  Education and training  One of SIB‚Äôs priorities is to promote and coordinate education in bioinformatics. SIB members are directly, or indirectly, involved in a number of bioinformatics courses at all educational levels ‚Äì from high school to undergraduate and graduate degrees ‚Äì as well as in specialized training for life scientists. SIB also promotes a PhD Training Network in bioinformatics, which is open to graduate students at Swiss schools of higher education. The objectives of this network are two-fold: # To offer graduate students in bioinformatics a set of cutting-edge courses that provide both the theoretical and the practical knowledge necessary to work on a successful PhD research project in bioinformatics. # To foster the development of a network of PhD students and promote the exchange of ideas, as well as the mobility of the students between participating institutions.  Popular science  The SIB is also involved in bringing bioinformatics to the layman. Understanding the growing importance this relatively recent science has in today‚Äôs society is becoming fundamental. Indeed, in not too distant a future, patients will be referring to results directly generated by bioinformatics methods. Since the year 2000, in order to heighten public awareness, the SIB has taken part in numerous science fairs, created two online magazines,Protein Spotlight, on the ExPASy server.Prolune, on the ExPASy server. an outdoor exhibition and, in 2012, a virtual exhibition.Chromosome Walk, the SIB virtual exhibition.

History  Allantoin was first isolated in 1800 by the Italian physician Michele Francesco Buniva (1761‚Äì1834) and the French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who mistakenly believed it to be present in the amniotic fluid.See: * Buniva and Vauquelin (1800) \\"Sur l'eau de l'amnios de femme et de vache\\" (On the amniotic fluid of women and cows), Annales de chimie, 33 : 269-282. * See also: Leopold Gmelin with Henry Watts, trans., Hand-book of Chemistry (London, England: The Cavendish Society, 1856), vol. 10, p. 260. In 1821, the French chemist Jean Louis Lassaigne found it in the fluid of the allantois; he called it \\"l'acide allantoique\\".Lassaigne (1821) \\"Nouvelles recherches sur la composition les eaux de l'allanto√Øde et de l'amnios de la vache\\" (New investigations into the composition of the allantoic and amniotic fluids of the cow), Annales de chimie et de physique, 2nd series, 17 : 295-305. On pp. 300 ff, Lassaigne names and characterizes \\"l'acide allantoique\\" (allantoic acid). In 1837, the German chemists Friedrich W√∂hler and Justus Liebig synthesized it from uric acid and renamed it \\"allanto√Øn\\".See: * Liebig and W√∂hler (1837) \\"Ueber die Natur der Harns√§ure\\" (On the nature of uric acid), Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 41 (8) : 561-569. Allantoin is named on p. 563. From p. 563: \\"Sie sind Allanto√Øss√§ure, oder dieselbe Substance, die man in der Allanto√Øsflussigkeit der K√ºhe gefunden hat; wir werden sie von nun an Allanto√Øn nennen.\\" (They [i.e., the crystals previously isolated] are allantois acid, or the same substance that one found in the allantois fluid of cows; we will call it \\"allantoin\\" from now on.) * Reprinted in: F. W√∂hler and J. Liebig (1838) \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Natur der Harns√§ure\\" (Investigations into the nature of uric acid), Annalen der Pharmacie, 26 : 241-340. Animals Named after the allantois (an amniote embryonic excretory organ in which it concentrates during development in most mammals except humans and other higher apes), it is a product of oxidation of uric acid by purine catabolism. After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals. In humans and other higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to allantoin is not present, so the former is excreted. Recombinant rasburicase is sometimes used as a drug to catalyze this metabolic conversion in patients. In fish, allantoin is broken down further (into ammonia) before excretion. Allantoin has been shown to improve insulin resistance when administered to rats and increased lifespan when administered to the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans.  Bacteria  In bacteria, purines and their derivatives (such as allantoin) are used as secondary sources of nitrogen under nutrient-limiting conditions. Their degradation yields ammonia, which can then be utilized. For instance, Bacillus subtilis is able to utilize allantoin as its sole nitrogen source. Mutants in the B. subtilis pucI gene were unable to grow on allantoin, indicating that it encodes an allantoin transporter. In Streptomyces coelicolor, allantoinase (EC 3.5.2.5) and allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) are essential for allantoin metabolism. In this species the catabolism of allantoin, and the subsequent release of ammonium, inhibits antibiotic production (Streptomyces species synthesize about half of all known antibiotics of microbial origin).  Applications  Allantoin is present in botanical extracts of the comfrey plant and in the urine of most mammals. Chemically synthesized bulk allantoin, which is chemically equivalent to natural allantoin, is safe, non-toxic, compatible with cosmetic raw materials and meets CTFA and JSCI requirements. Over 10,000 patents reference allantoin.Patent Lens search =Cosmetics and toiletries= Manufacturers cite several beneficial effects for allantoin as an active ingredient in over-the- counter cosmetics, including: a moisturizing and keratolytic effect, increasing the water content of the extracellular matrix and enhancing the desquamation of upper layers of dead skin cells, increasing the smoothness of the skin; promoting cell proliferation and wound healing; and a soothing, anti-irritant, and skin protectant effect by forming complexes with irritant and sensitizing agents. An animal study in 2010 found that based on the results from histological analyses, a soft lotion with 5% allantoin ameliorates the wound healing process, by modulating the inflammatory response. The study also suggests that quantitative analysis lends support to the idea that allantoin also promotes fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix. A study published in 2009 reported the treatment of pruritus in mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis with a topical nonsteroidal agent containing allantoin. =Pharmaceuticals= It is frequently present in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions, various cosmetic lotions and creams, and other cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. =Biomarker of oxidative stress= Since uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans, only non-enzymatic processes with reactive oxygen species will give rise to allantoin, which is thus a suitable biomarker to measure oxidative stress in chronic illnesses and senescence.

History At the request of Laurence Sheil, then the Bishop of Adelaide, St Mary's College was founded by the Dominican Sisters who arrived from the Dominican Convent in Cabra, Ireland as missionaries. The foundation stone was laid in 1868. The Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart provided primary education for students from the lower socioeconomic status while the Dominican Sisters took responsibility for middle-class girls from both Catholic and other religious backgrounds whose parents could afford post-primary education. Academics Approximately 800 girls attend the school in classes from Reception (age 5) to year 12 (age 17-18). The school offers a \\"Year 13\\" program for students who wish to obtain their Stage 2 SACE (Year 12) over two years. Houses The school has four sporting houses, in which the students are placed at the commencement of their enrolment at St Mary's. St Marys, St Dominics, St Catherines and St Thomas each compete in annual sports days and swimming carnivals. Extracurricular activities St Mary's supports many charities and selects Year 11 students to attend pilgrimages annually. One is called the \\"Lands Trip\\", led by Robert Napoli, Learning Area Co-Ordinator for Religious Education. The Lands Trip selects 6 - 8 girls to travel into the APY Lands, to visit an Aboriginal community and experience the literacy of some Indigenous Australians. This pilgrimage started in 2008 and is renowned for being tough on the emotions and physical abilities of the students embarking this trip. The other pilgrimage is to Vietnam. In 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 St Mary's College and Christian Brothers College students' combined to participate in a Pilgrimage to Vietnam. The primary focus of the Pilgrimage is on giving service and working with orphaned, disabled children in the Phu My Orphanage in the Thi Nghe District, Saigon. The Orphanage is operated by the Sisters of St Paul de Charters where they provide care for over 300 children. While at the Orphanage students participate in a range of activities and are immersed in the day-to-day operation of the Orphanage.

A Belleville washer is a type of spring shaped like a washer. It is the frusto-conical shape that gives the washer its characteristic spring. The \\"Belleville\\" name comes from the inventor Julien Belleville who in Dunkerque, France, in 1867 patented a spring design which already contained the principle of the disc spring. The real inventor of Belleville washers is unknown. Through the years, many profiles for disc springs have been developed. Today the most used are the profiles with or without contact flats, while some other profiles, like disc springs with trapezoidal cross-section, have lost importance.  Features and use  M4 anti-tank mine (circa 1945) showing the steel belleville spring in the fuze mechanism M14 antipersonnel landmine, showing the firing pin mounted in the centre of a plastic belleville spring In the different fields, if they are used as springs or to apply a flexible pre-load to a bolted joint or bearing, Belleville washers can be used as a single spring or as a stack. In a spring-stack, disc springs can be stacked in the same or in an alternating orientation and of course it is possible to stack packets of multiple springs stacked in the same direction. Disc springs have a number of advantageous properties compared to other types of springs: * Very large loads can be supported with a small installation space, * Due to the nearly unlimited number of possible combinations of individual disc springs, the characteristic curve and the column length can be further varied within additional limits, * High service life under dynamic load if the spring is properly dimensioned, * Provided the permissible stress is not exceeded, no impermissible relaxation occurs, * With suitable arrangement, a large damping (high hysteresis) effect may be achieved, * Because the springs are of an annular shape, force transmission is absolutely concentric. Thanks to these advantageous properties, Belleville washers are today used in a large number of fields, some examples are listed in the following. In the arms industry, Belleville springs are used, for instance, in a number of landmines e.g. the American M19, M15, M14, M1 and the Swedish Tret-Mi.59. The target (a person or vehicle) exerts pressure on the belleville spring, causing it to exceed a trigger threshold and flip the adjacent firing pin downwards into a stab detonator, firing both it and the surrounding booster charge and main explosive filling. Belleville washers have been used as return springs in artillery pieces, one example being the French Canet range of marine/coastal cannon from the late 1800s (75 mm, 120mm, 152 mm). Some makers of bolt action target rifles use Belleville washer stacks in the bolt instead of a more traditional spring to release the firing pin, as they reduce the time between trigger actuation and firing pin impact on the cartridge. Belleville washers, without serrations which can harm the clamping surface, have no significant locking capability in bolted applications. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900009424.pdf On aircraft (typically experimental aircraft) with wooden propellers, Belleville washers used on the mounting bolts can be useful as an indicator of swelling or shrinkage of the wood. By torquing their associated bolts to provide a specific gap between sets of washers placed with \\"high ends\\" facing each other, a change in relative moisture content in the propeller wood will result in a change of the gaps which is often great enough to be detected visually. As propeller balance depends on the weight of blades being equal, a radical difference in the washer gaps may indicate a difference in moisture content - and thus weight - in the adjacent blades. In the aircraft and automotive industries (including Formula One cars ) disc springs are used as vibration- damping elements because of their extremely detailed tuning ability. The Cirrus SR2x series of airplanes, uses a Belleville washer setup to damp out nose gear oscillations (or \\"shimmy\\"). In the building industry, in Japan stacks of disc springs have been used under buildings as vibration dampers for earthquakes.  Stacking  Multiple Belleville washers may be stacked to modify the spring constant (or spring rate) or the amount of deflection. Stacking in the same direction will add the spring constant in parallel, creating a stiffer joint (with the same deflection). Stacking in an alternating direction is the same as adding common springs in series, resulting in a lower spring constant and greater deflection. Mixing and matching directions allow a specific spring constant and deflection capacity to be designed. Generally, if n disc springs are stacked in parallel (facing the same direction), standing the load, the deflection of the whole stack is equal to that of one disc spring divided by n, then, to obtain the same deflection of a single disc spring the load to apply has to be n times that of a single disc spring. On the other hand, if n washers are stacked in series (facing in alternating directions), standing the load, the deflection is equal to n times that of one washer while the load to apply at the whole stack to obtain the same deflection of one disc spring has to be that of a single disc spring divided by n.  Performance considerations  In a parallel stack, hysteresis (load losses) will occur due to friction between the springs. The hysteresis losses can be advantageous in some systems because of the added damping and dissipation of vibration energy. This loss due to friction can be calculated using hysteresis methods. Ideally, no more than 4 springs should be placed in parallel. If a greater load is required, then factor of safety must be increased in order to compensate for loss of load due to friction. Friction loss is not as much of an issue in series stacks In a series stack, the deflection is not exactly proportional to the number of springs. This is because of a bottoming out effect when the springs are compressed to flat as the contact surface area increases once the spring is deflected beyond 95%. This decreases the moment arm and the spring will offer a greater spring resistance. Hysteresis can be used to calculate predicted deflections in a series stack. The number of springs used in a series stack is not as much of an issue as in parallel stacks even if, generally, the stack height should not be greater than three times the outside diameter of the disc spring. If it is not possible to avoid a longer stack, then it should be divided into 2 or possibly 3 partial stacks with suitable washers. These washers should be guided as exactly as possible. As previously said, Belleville washers are useful for adjustments because different thicknesses can be swapped in and out and they can be configured to achieve essentially infinite tunability of spring rate while only filling up a small part of the technician's tool box. They are ideal in situations where a heavy spring force is required with minimal free length and compression before reaching solid height. The downside, though, is weight, and they are severely travel limited compared to a conventional coil spring when free length is not an issue. A wave washer also acts as a spring, but wave washers of comparable size do not produce as much force as Belleville washers, nor can they be stacked in series.  Disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness  For disc springs with a thickness of more than 6.0 mm, DIN 2093 specifies small contact surfaces at points I and III (that is the point where the load is applied and the point where the load touches the ground) in addition to the rounded corners. These contact flats improve definition of the point of load application and, particularly for spring stacks, reduce friction at the guide rod. The result is a considerable reduction in the lever arm length and a corresponding increase in the spring load. This is in turn compensated for by a reduction in the spring thickness. The reduced thickness is specified in accordance with the following conditions: * The overall height remains unaltered, * The width of the contact flats (that is the annulus width) is to be approximately 1/150 of the outside diameter, * The load applied to the reduced-thickness spring to obtain a deflection equal to the 75% of the free height (of an unreduced spring) must be the same as for an unreduced spring. As the overall height is not reduced, springs with reduced thickness inevitably have an increased flank angle and a greater cone height than springs of the same nominal dimension without reduced thickness. Therefore, the characteristic curve is altered and becomes completely different.  Calculation  Starting from 1936, when J. O. Almen and A.L√†szl√≤ published a simplified method of calculation, always more accurate and complex methods appeared also in order to include in calculations disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness. So, although today there are more accurate methods of calculation, the most used are the simple and convenient formulas of DIN 2092 as, for standard dimensions, they produce values which correspond well to the measured results. Considering a Belleville washer with outside diameter {D_e}, inside diameter {D_i}, height {l} and thickness {t}, where {h_0} is the free height, that is the difference between the height and the thickness, the following coefficients are obtained: : \\\\delta=\\\\frac{D_e}{D_i} : {C_1}=\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{t'}{t}\\\\right)^2}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{l}{t}-\\\\frac{t'}{t}+\\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\right)\\\\cdot{\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{8}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{l}{t}-\\\\frac{t'}{t}+\\\\frac{3}{8}\\\\right)} } : {C_2}=\\\\frac{C_1}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{t'}{t}\\\\right)^3}\\\\cdot\\\\left[\\\\frac{5}{32}\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{l}{t}-1\\\\right)^2+1\\\\right] : {K_4}=\\\\sqrt{-\\\\frac{C_1}{2}+\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{C_1}{2}\\\\right)^2+C_2}} The equation to calculate the load to apply to a single disc spring in order to obtain a deflection {s} is: : F=\\\\frac{4E}{1-\\\\mu^2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{t^4}{K_1-{D_e}^2}\\\\cdot{K_4}^2\\\\cdot\\\\frac{s}{t}\\\\cdot\\\\left [{K_4}^2\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{h_0}{t}-\\\\frac{s}{t}\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{h_0}{t}-\\\\frac{s}{2t}\\\\right)+1\\\\right] Note that for disc springs with constant thickness, {t'} is equal to {t} and consequently {K_4} is 1. For what concerns disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness it has to be said that a paper published on July 2013, demonstrated that the {K_4} equation as defined inside the standard norms is not correct as it would result in every reduced thickness being considered right and this is, of course, impossible. As written in that paper {K_4} should be replaced with a new coefficient, {R_d}, which depends not only from the \\\\frac{t'}{t} ratio but also from the flank angles of the spring. The spring constant (or spring rate) is defined as: : {k}=\\\\frac{dF}{ds} Belleville washer stack illustration If friction and bottoming-out effects are ignored, the spring rate of a stack of identical Belleville washers can be quickly approximated. Counting from one end of the stack, group by the number of adjacent washers in parallel. For example, in the stack of washers to the right, the grouping is 2-3-1-2, because there is a group of 2 washers in parallel, then a group of 3, then a single washer, then another group of 2. The total spring coefficient is: : K = \\\\frac{k}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^g \\\\frac{1}{n_i}} : K = \\\\frac{k}{\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{1}+\\\\frac{1}{2}} : K = \\\\frac{3}{7} \\\\cdot{k} Where * n_i= the number of washers in the ith group * {g} = the number of groups * {k} = the spring constant of one washer So, a 2-3-1-2 stack (or, since addition is commutative, a 3-2-2-1 stack) gives a spring constant of 3/7 that of a single washer. These same 8 washers can be arranged in a 3-3-2 configuration (K = \\\\frac{6}{7}\\\\cdot k), a 4-4 configuration (K = 2\\\\cdot k), a 2-2-2-2 configuration (K = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot), and various other configurations. The number of unique ways to stack {n} washers is defined by the integer partition function p(n) and increases rapidly with large {n}, allowing fine-tuning of the spring constant. However, each configuration will have a different length, requiring the use of shims in most cases.

It is a companion film to 1968's I Am Curious (Blue); the two were initially intended to be one hour film.Vilgot Sj√∂man, I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film (Grove Press, 1968).  Plot  Director Vilgot Sj√∂man plans to make a social film starring his lover Lena Nyman, a young theater student who has a strong interest in social issues. Nyman's character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in Stockholm and is driven by a burning passion for social justice and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as \\"religion\\" and \\"men\\", and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of concentration camps and a portrait of Francisco Franco, reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena's relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco as part of the International Brigades, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period. Through her father Lena meets the slick Bill (B√∂rje in the original Swedish), who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic lifestyle, meditating, studying nonviolence and practicing yoga. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shotgun, but they soon make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of soccer players ‚Äì she notes that they number 23 ‚Äì to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally Martin Luther King Jr. drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice nonviolence. Lena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has scabies. They are treated at a clinic, and then go their separate ways. As the embedded story of Lena and Bill begins to resolve, the film crew and director Sj√∂man are featured more. The relationship between Lena the actress and Bill the actor has become intimate during the production of Vilgot's film, and Vilgot is jealous and clashes with Bill. The film concludes with Lena returning Vilgot's keys as he meets with another young female theater student. = Nonfictional content = The film includes an interview with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., filmed in March 1966, when King was visiting Stockholm along with Harry Belafonte with a view to starting a new initiative for Swedish support of African Americans.Sj√∂man, published scenario (New York: Grove Press, 1968, 264 p., 266 stills from the film; translated from the Swedish by Martin Minow and Jenny Bohman). The film also includes an interview with then Minister of Transportation Olof Palme (later Prime Minister of Sweden), who talks about the existence of class structure in Swedish society (he was told it was for a documentary film), and footage of Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Coincidentally, both King and Palme would later be assassinated; King in 1968 a few months after the film's release, and Palme in 1986.

One particularly controversial scene features Lena kissing her lover's flaccid penis. Released in Sweden in October 1967, it was released in the U.S. in March 1969, immediately attracting a ban in Massachusetts for being pornographic, with the Boston Police Department seizing the film reels from the Symphony Cinemas. After proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Karalexis v. Byrne, 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969)), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States (Byrne v. Karalexis, 396 U.S. 976 (1969) and 401 U.S. 216 (1971)), the Second Circuit found the film not to be obscene.I Am Curious / Jag √§r nyfiken  Film International An arsonist torched the Heights Theater in Houston during the film's run there. =Box office= The film was popular at the box office and was the 12th most popular film in the United States and Canada in 1969 and the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the United States and Canada of all- time with a gross of $20,238,100. It was number one at the US box office for two weeks in November 1969. One reason it did so well was that it became popular among film stars to be seen going to the film. News of Johnny Carson seeing the film legitimized going to see it despite any misgivings about possible pornographic content. =Critical reception= Contemporary Initial reception to Curious Yellow was divided. Vincent Canby of the New York Times referred to it as a \\"Good, serious movie about a society in transition,\\" and Norman Mailer said he felt \\"like a better man\\" after having seen it. Conversely, Rex Reed described the film as \\"about as good for you as drinking furniture polish\\" and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times lambasted it as \\"a dog... a real dog\\" and \\"stupid and slow and uninteresting.\\". Retrospective In recent years, Yellow has received some reappraisal, thanks in part to Gary Giddins, who authored the 2003 essay accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, and a review by Nathan Southern on the All Movie Guide website. Southern assesses the picture as \\"a droll and sophisticated comedy about the emotional, political, social, and sexual liberation of a young woman... a real original that has suffered from public incomprehension since its release and is crying out for reassessment and rediscovery.\\". As of August 2015, I Am Curious (Yellow) received a 52% rating based on 25 reviews, 13 \\"fresh\\" and 12 \\"rotten\\" on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. =Accolades= Olof Palme (who played himself in an uncredited role in the movie) and Lena Nyman, taken at the Guldbagge Award ceremony. Nyman won the 1967 award for Best Actress in a leading role. Nyman won the award for Best Actress at the 5th Guldbagge Awards for her role in this film and I Am Curious (Blue).

Designed as a more powerful evolution of the Pilatus PC-7, the PC-9's first flight was made in May 1984 after which certification was achieved in September 1985. After this, the first production orders for the type were received from the Royal Saudi Air Force, with deliveries commencing in 1985. Since then, more than 250 airframes have been produced across five different variants and the type is employed by a number of military and civilian operators around the world, including the Swiss Air Force, the Croatian Air Force, and the Royal Thai Air Force. Design and development The PC-9 is a more powerful evolution of the PC-7. It retains the overall layout of its predecessor, but it has very little structural commonality with it. Amongst other improvements, the PC-9 features a larger cockpit with stepped ejection seats and also has a ventral airbrake. The PC-9 program officially started in 1982. Although some aerodynamic elements were tested on a PC-7 during 1982 and 1983, the first flight of the first PC-9 prototype took place on 7 May 1984. A second prototype flew on 20 July of the same year; this prototype had all the standard electronic flight instrumentation and environmental control systems installed and was thus almost fully representative of the production version. Certification was achieved in September 1985. By this time, the PC-9 had lost the Royal Air Force trainer competition to the Short Tucano. However, the marketing links that Pilatus built up with British Aerospace during the competition led to their first order from Saudi Arabia. , more than 250 aircraft of this type have been built. Operational history The first production aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew on 19 May 1987, under the Australian designation PC-9/A. Condor of Germany uses 10 examples of the target-towing variant. In August 2015, Pilatus received a contract to deliver nine PC-9Ms to the Royal Jordanian Air Force, but in April 2016 changed the order to eight PC-21s. Deliveries were due to start in January 2017 under the original deal. The United States Army operated three PC-9s from 1991‚Äì1996 as chase and test aircraft, they eventually were sold to Slovenia in 1995.Harding 1997, p. 202.

Introduced two or three years after the Italian Fiat 127 and the French Renault 5, the model was seen at the time as Germany's first home grown entrant in Europe's emerging \\"supermini\\" class. The Audi 50 was built by Audi NSU Auto Union AG at the former NSU factory in Neckarsulm, Germany and at the giant Wolfsburg plant by Volkswagen. The car was rebadged six weeks later by Volkswagen as the Volkswagen Polo with a wider range of engine and other options. The Volkswagen Polo was launched in the home market in September 1974 and appeared in export markets, including the United Kingdom, a few months later. The car was offered as a three door hatchback with a petrol engine, producing either or for the LS and GL models, respectively. The model was popular in Europe, both because of its generous specifications for a car of the time, and on account of its relatively low price. The Volkswagen and Audi badged models were sold alongside each other for three years until 1978, but the cheaper Volkswagen Polo outsold the Audi 50 almost immediately, and Audi discontinued the Audi 50 in 1978, after a total production of 180,812 units. A planned facelift, which would have given the Audi 50 a look closer to that of the Audi 100 and Audi 80 was never implemented, because of a holding company board decision that the Audi brand should concentrate on larger, more expensive cars. The Volkswagen Polo range continued to evolve, with the Volkswagen Derby notchback version, despite being developed by Audi at Ingolstadt, branded as a Volkswagen and launched in 1977. Subsequently, the Volkswagen Polo has evolved through numerous generations to the present day. The Audi 50 had no replacement in the supermini class, until the launch of the significantly larger Audi A2 in November 1999, which was also discontinued in August 2005.

However, many other types of coiled coil exist. A coiled coil is a structural motif in proteins in which 2‚Äì7 alpha-helices are coiled together like the strands of a rope (dimers and trimers are the most common types). Many coiled coil-type proteins are involved in important biological functions such as the regulation of gene expression, e.g. transcription factors. Notable examples are the oncoproteins c-Fos and c-jun, as well as the muscle protein tropomyosin. Discovery The possibility of coiled coils for Œ±-keratin was initially somewhat controversial. Linus Pauling and Francis Crick independently came to the conclusion that this was possible at about the same time. In the summer of 1952, Pauling visited the laboratory in England where Crick worked. Pauling and Crick met and spoke about various topics; at one point, Crick asked whether Pauling had considered \\"coiled coils\\" (Crick came up with the term), to which Pauling said he had. Upon returning to the United States, Pauling resumed research on the topic. He concluded that coiled coils exist, and submitted a lengthy manuscript to the journal Nature in October. Pauling's son Peter Pauling worked at the same lab as Crick, and mentioned the report to him. Crick believed that Pauling had stolen his idea, and submitted a shorter note to Nature a few days after Pauling's manuscript arrived. Eventually, after some controversy and frequent correspondences, Crick's lab declared that the idea had been reached independently by both researchers, and that no intellectual theft had occurred. In his note (which was published first due to its shorter length), Crick proposed the Coiled Coil and as well as mathematical methods for determining their structure. Remarkably, this was soon after the structure of the alpha helix was suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. These studies were published in the absence of knowledge of a keratin sequence. The first keratin sequences were determined by Hanukoglu and Fuchs in 1982. Based on sequence and secondary structure prediction analyses identified the coiled-coil domains of keratins. These models have been confirmed by structural analyses of coiled-coil domains of keratins. Molecular structure Coiled coils usually contain a repeated pattern, hxxhcxc, of hydrophobic (h) and charged (c) amino-acid residues, referred to as a heptad repeat. The positions in the heptad repeat and are usually labeled abcdefg, where a and d are the hydrophobic positions, often being occupied by isoleucine, leucine, or valine. Folding a sequence with this repeating pattern into an alpha-helical secondary structure causes the hydrophobic residues to be presented as a 'stripe' that coils gently around the helix in left-handed fashion, forming an amphipathic structure. The most favorable way for two such helices to arrange themselves in the water-filled environment of the cytoplasm is to wrap the hydrophobic strands against each other sandwiched between the hydrophilic amino acids. Thus, it is the burial of hydrophobic surfaces that provides the thermodynamic driving force for the oligomerization. The packing in a coiled-coil interface is exceptionally tight, with almost complete van der Waals contact between the side-chains of the a and d residues. This tight packing was originally predicted by Francis Crick in 1952 and is referred to as Knobs into holes packing. The Œ±-helices may be parallel or anti-parallel, and usually adopt a left-handed super-coil (Figure 1). Although disfavored, a few right-handed coiled coils have also been observed in nature and in designed proteins. Biological roles =Role in HIV infection= Side view of the gp41 hexamer that initiates the entry of HIV into its target cell. Viral entry into CD4-positive cells commences when three subunits of a glycoprotein 120 (gp120) bind to CD4 receptor and a coreceptor. Glycoprotein gp120 is closely associated to a trimer of gp41 via van der Waals interactions. Upon binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and coreceptor, a number of conformational changes in the structure leads to the dissociation of gp120 and to the exposure of gp41 and at the same time to the anchoring of the gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide sequence into the host cell. A spring-loaded mechanism is responsible for bringing the viral and cell membranes in close enough proximity that they will fuse. The origin of the spring-loaded mechanism lies within the exposed gp41, which contains two consecutive heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) following the fusion peptide at the N terminus of the protein. HR1 forms a parallel, trimeric coiled coil onto which HR2 region coils, forming the trimer-of-hairpins (or six-helix bundle) structure, thereby facilitating membrane fusion through bringing the membranes close to each other. The virus then enters the cell and begins its replication. Recently, inhibitors derived from HR2 such as Fuzeon (DP178, T-20) bind to the HR1 region on gp41 have been developed. However, peptides derived from HR1 have little viral inhibition efficacy due to the propensity for these peptides to aggregate in solution. Chimeras of these HR1-derived peptides with GCN4 leucine zippers have been developed and have shown to be more active than Fuzeon, but these have not entered the clinic yet. =As oligomerization tags= Because of their specific interaction coiled coils can be used as a \\"tags\\" to stabilize or enforce a specific oligomerization state. A coiled coil interaction has been observed to drive the oligomerization of the BBS2 and BBS7 subunits of the BBSome. Design The general problem of deciding on the folded structure of a protein when given the amino acid sequence (the so-called protein folding problem) has not been solved. However, the coiled coil is one of a relatively small number of folding motifs for which the relationships between the sequence and the final folded structure are comparatively well understood. Harbury et al. performed a landmark study using an archetypal coiled coil, GCN4, in which rules that govern the way that peptide sequence affects the oligomeric state (that is, the number of alpha- helices in the final assembly) were established. The GCN4 coiled coil is a 31-amino-acid (which equates to just over four heptads) parallel, dimeric (i.e., consisting of two alpha-helices) coiled coil and has a repeated isoleucine (or I, in single-letter code) and leucine (L) at the a and d positions, respectively, and forms a dimeric coiled coil. When the amino acids in the a and d positions were changed from I at a and L at d to L at a and I at d, a trimeric (three alpha-helices) coiled coil was formed. Furthermore, mutating the a and d positions both to L resulted in the formation of a tetrameric (four alpha-helices) coiled coil. These represent a set of rules for the determination of coiled coil oligomeric states and allows scientists to effectively \\"dial-in\\" the oligomerization behavior. Another aspect of coiled coil assembly that is relatively well understood, at least in the case of dimeric coiled coils, is that placing a polar residue (in particular asparagine, N) at opposing a positions forces parallel assembly of the coiled coil. This effect is due to a self-complementary hydrogen bonding between these residues, which would go unsatisfied if an N were paired with, for instance, an L on the opposing helix. It was recently demonstrated by Peacock, Pikramenou and co-workers that coiled coils may be self-assembled using lanthanide(III) ions as a template, thus producing novel imaging agents.

It can be used to increase staff awareness of public relations, advertising, marketing or corporate image. Other terms for industrial musicals include the corporate musical or industrial show, but the latter can also refer to trade shows, which are publicity events organized by businesses in a specific industry to promote their products to potential buyers. Industrial musicals are not restricted to corporations or to businesses involved in industry. They should not be confused with industrial music, or with musicals produced by businesses to be seen by the general public, for example, Disney's stage production of The Lion King. History Industrial musicals originated from company songs, anthems and jingles for promoting enthusiasm among workers. The songs were brought in by the management, as opposed to worker-created work songs. Internal musical groups could be formed to encourage company loyalty, keep employees happy, and to help advertise the company to the public. Early 20th century examples include IBM's internal songbook Songs of the IBM, and the Larkin Soap Company which organized community singing and had a women's drum corps, an orchestra, a ukulele club, and daily recitals on a pipe organ. At some point, a collection of company songs was extended into a full musical theater format, and the industrial musical was born. Many of these musicals were made in North America during the economic boom that followed World War II, and this practice continued into the 1980s and 1990s. The earliest known industrial musicals were produced by retail and automotive companies such as Ford, General Motors, and the Marshall Field's chain of department stores. By the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, other types of businesses also began to put on shows. Some musicals were part of annual showcase events for presenting a company's new line of products. Businesses could spend a lot of money to produce a musical, hiring talented Broadway composers and lyricists. The pay was very good, the task was challenging, and from the theatre's point of view, the production costs were much higher than a regular Broadway musical. Shows could have as many as 30 people in the cast and a 60-piece orchestra. Composer Hank Beebe estimates that the 1957 Chevrolet musical was budgeted at over 3 million dollars (U.S.), because it cost six times the amount it took to bring My Fair Lady to the stage that same year. The song performances were rarely heard outside of the companies they were written for, but sometimes the employees would be given a souvenir record album. Some productions lasted for a limited number of nights, while others traveled from city to city for regional sales meetings. According to composer John Kander, who conducted several industrial shows early in his career and wrote the music for the 1966 General Electric industrial Go Fly a Kite (the complete score from which was issued on a 2-LP set that was given to GE employees), the cast albums for these industrial shows \\"were never intended for commercial release. [...] It was sort of a separate world.\\" Yet it is largely through these rare albums that evidence of these shows has survived. By the 1980s, industrial musicals were made less and less often. Jonathan Ward, a writer and DJ who collects industrial musical albums, theorizes that the reason for the decline was partially due to rising production costs for stage shows, and the availability of low-cost video and multimedia technology. Ward thinks another reason for the decline was a change in work attitudes. In the 1950s and 1960s, employees might have expected to spend the majority of their working careers with one company. By the 1980s, employees and the management may have been less inclined to think this way. The feelings of company loyalty and community promoted in the song lyrics would have been met with more cynicism. Some corporations, however, continued to successfully produce industrial musicals during the 1980s and 1990s and beyond. The Shaklee Corporation created its own in-house production company in 1980. Their team, led by producer Dale T. Hardin, director Craig Schaefer, and composer/lyricist Michael Reno created dozens of Shaklee Shows from concept to performance, and eventually branched out into in-house satellite TV. The Shaklee creative team created their own production company called \\"Command Performance Productions\\" that produced shows for other clients such as Charles Schwab and Marriott Lodging until 2000. Despite the trends that affected industrial musicals, businesses have continued to make company songs. For example, KPMG produced a corporate anthem in 2001 titled \\"Our Vision of Global Strategy.\\" In 2013, the first book on the history of industrial musicals, titled Everything's Coming Up Profits, was published, written by Steve Young and Mike \\"Sport\\" Murphy. A series of industrial music audio anthologies, organized by decade, accompanied the book. In 2018, Bathtubs Over Broadway, a documentary on industrial musicals and Steve Young's quest to discover their creators, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Description The community is named after the Amargosa River which flows through the valley from its origination in Nevada to its terminus in Death Valley, California. Like most desert rivers, the long Amargosa flows on the surface only when rare rainfalls flood the desert washes, except for a segment near Shoshone, California, where the river flows perennially. The name Amargosa Valley is used locally with reference to the actual geographic valley, although for the most part, it is coincident with the Amargosa Desert and is noted as such on many maps. The populated area of the Amargosa Valley is sandwiched between US 95 to the north and the California border to the south. Some of the residential streets in the community cross over into California. Much of the Nevada-California border in this area is contiguous with the boundaries of Death Valley National Park. The national park boundary extends into Nevada near Beatty, approximately northwest of Amargosa Valley. Amargosa Valley is located approximately northwest of Las Vegas, northwest of Pahrump, and north of Death Valley Junction, California. History The Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad ran through the valley from 1906 to 1940, for borax mining operations. Modern development did not begin until the early 1950s. Electric power, other than that produced by private generators, was not available until 1963. Until the early 1990s growth in Amargosa Valley was minimal. More recently, intense growth in Las Vegas has led many new residents to settle in Amargosa Valley and nearby Pahrump. Geography Amargosa Valley is located at 36.58001 North, 116.44487 West at an elevation of 2,640 feet (805 m) above sea level. The landscape is typical of lower to moderate elevations in the Mojave Desert, with flat expanses of sandy soil punctuated by rocky mounds and hills. Predominant indigenous vegetation is White Bursage and Creosote Bush, with some Joshua Trees and Cacti at higher elevations. Numerous non-native plant species have also been introduced. Recreation Alien Cathouse is one of Nevada's legal brothels. It is located near the corner of U.S. 95 and SR 373. Longstreet Hotel, Casino, and RV Resort is a full-service hotel and casino with restaurants and a RV park. The hotel is located on SR 373, near the Nevada-California border. The hotel is popular with visitors to nearby Death Valley National Park. Big Dunes, popular for weekenders from all over Southern Nevada, is located on the north side of Amargosa Valley. Ash Meadows Wildlife Refuge is located in the southern end of Amargosa Valley.

The south end is alternately called the \\"Amargosa River Valley'\\" or the \\"Tecopa Valley.\\" Its northernmost point is around Beatty, Nevada and southernmost is Tecopa, California, where the Amargosa River enters into the Amargosa Canyon. Geography The Amargosa Valley (\\"the Valley\\") is located within the Basin and Range Province (\\"the Province\\") which is characterized by abrupt changes in elevation, alternating between narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. As is typical of the Province, the Valley is long from north to south and narrow from east to west. It lies to the east of Death Valley, separated from it by the Amargosa Range and Funeral Mountains. The Valley lies within the Mohave Desert region of the Province. The more narrowly bounded Amargosa Desert forms the eastern portion of the Valley. History =Prehistory= It is not known when the first humans settled in the Amargosa Desert. Ancient campsites have been found that date back at least 10,000 years, to the end of the last ice age. Recent examination of archaeological remains in the valley implies more extensive use by aboriginal peoples than had been previously estimated. Pottery and other artifacts have been found that date back from approximately 1000 A.D. to even earlier times. During the nineteenth century, two groups of Native Americans occupied the Amargosa Valley: the Southern Paiute and the Western Shoshone. Both were extremely adept at extracting a living from their marginal environment, subsisting on wild plant foods and supplemented by wild game. =European exploration= The Old Spanish Trail and the later wagon road called the Old Mormon Road or Salt Lake Road, ran through the south end of Amargosa Valley, passing from Resting Springs, east of present-day Tecopa, 7 miles to Willow Spring on the east bank of the canyon of the Amargosa River (then called Saleratus Creek), below Tecopa and above the mouth of China Ranch Wash. After the Donner Party's disastrous winter of 1847 in the Sierra Nevada mountains, which happened just before the news of California gold became public, a loose group arrived in October 1849 at the Great Salt Lake. They organized under the guidance of a Captain Hunt to head for the San Bernardino‚ÄìLos Angeles area. The best alternative to risking the Donner route was to try an end run to the south of the Sierras. The Old Spanish Trail had long been used by Indians, traders, explorers, and mountain men as a convenient but rough route, confined to horseback and pack animals, to California. It ran north from Santa Fe to the Salt Lake area then back south along the edge of the mountains to San Diego, and had been used ever since the days of Cabeza De Vaca's journey through the country. Leaving the Salt Lake area, they were overtaken by another party led by a guide named Captain Smith. He assured them that a more direct route across the southern deserts existed which was quite passable for wagons and showed them a copy of John C. Fremont's map of his explorations. The map had a large portion, then known as \\"The Great American Desert\\", left blank with the word \\"unexplored\\" across it. On this Smith's friend Barney Ward had drawn in a trail which showed plenty of graze for the animals, and adequate water for all with a description of the clear cool waters of Owens river and Lake Owens. The route would take them north and west of the then unknown Death Valley. Then, over Walker's Pass into California. Unfortunately, this map showed a fictitious mountain range, north of the Old Spanish Trail to Los Angeles and running roughly east‚Äìwest across central Nevada, and it may have been this non-existent mountain range that contributed to the emigrant's decision to chance leaving the established trail, under the assumption that water, and grass for the oxen, would be easier to locate along the base of the mountains. In later times, the exploration and mapping of Nevada would show that all of the mountain ranges in central Nevada run north‚Äìsouth, directly across the path the Bennett-Arcane Party took. The party was led by William L. Manly, Rev. James Brier, and Asahel Bennett, all experienced outdoorsmen and farmers out of the Wisconsin farm country who decided to risk it on the assurances that Smith, with the map, would accompany them. Hunt objected, but agreed to stay on as long as he was needed. Soon after their leaving Salt Lake, Smith's group split off as did their guide Hunt as the country got really rough for wagon passage with the main group of less adventurous emigrants and the map. Smith and Hunt both arrived with their parties in San Bernardino after tough but quick journeys around Death Valley. Manly, Brier, and Bennett led straight on into the Amargosa desert. They were followed by another small group, the Wade family party who stayed back one day. Not having to scout or break trail, the Wades had an easy journey compared to the others. After leaving Ash Meadows, they drove over the Amargosa range, and down into Death Valley through Furnace Creek Wash where they were quickly bogged down on the valley floor. Many of their oxen had died from lack of forage and they were immobilized, as the few remaining animals were starving and were too weak to pull wagons up and over the mountains to the west and south, even if a pass were found. The Wades, not so bad off, quickly turned south and drove themselves out of the valley and on to safety, probably via Wingate Wash. The Manley, Brier, & Bennett party sent Manley and a companion, John Haney Rogers, south out of the valley for help. The Briers made a heroic climb over the Panamints to safety, while the Bennetts waited huddled around their wagons with water but no food. Four weeks later, after an incredible 500 mile round-trip trek across the Mojave Desert to Rancho San Francisco (approx. 30 miles north of Los Angeles), Manly & Rogers returned with some food supplies and a single mule (three other horses had died on the return trip), and the Bennett and Arcane families walked and rode their remaining oxen out of what they named, \\"Death Valley\\". There appears to have been only one death among the '49er emigrants within Death Valley itself, a Capt. Culverwell. Two weeks before the return of Manly and Rogers, a small group had attempted to walk out to the southwest, and Capt. Culverwell, a middle-aged man, was unable to keep up with the younger, stronger men and had turned back to re-join the Bennett/Arcane party. He never made it, and succumbed to dehydration. His body was found by Manly & Rogers only a couple of miles short of the Bennett camp on their return trek from Rancho San Francisco. Two members of another group of emigrants, the Jayhawkers, who had been traveling with the Bennett/Arcane Party, died along the trail west of the Panamint Range; their names are given in Manly's journal as Mr. Fish and Mr. Isham. The granddaughter of Chief Winnamucca of the Piutes later wrote that the Indians at the time knew about both the Donner and Death Valley emigrant parties disasters and could easily have saved them. But they considered the whites to be a cruel and a mean people. While the main motivation of the emigrants was to join the California gold rush, the 1849 rush wasn't nearly as profitable as the later silver rush of the Comstock Lode in Nevada. Modern development Amargosa Valley is near the controversial Yucca Mountain Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility on federal land, designed for the storage of high-level nuclear waste. President George W. Bush signed House Joint Resolution 87 on July 23, 2002, authorizing the DOE to proceed with construction at Yucca Mountain, although the facility was not expected to accept its first shipments of radioactive materials before 2012. The facility's main entrance will be in Amargosa Valley, approximately 14 miles (23 km) south of the storage tunnels. In 2009 President Barack Obama stated that the repository was no longer being considered as a site for the long-term storage of nuclear waste. Controversy over water rights resulted in 2009 when Solar Millennium, a German company, announced plans to build a solar thermal energy plant in the Amargosa Valley. It would require 20% of the groundwater available in the valley's aquifer.\\"Alternative Energy Projects Stumble on a Need for Water\\" article by Todd Woody in The New York Times September 29, 2009 Amargosa Farm Road Solar Project was a proposed 500 megawatt (MW) solar power plant in Nye County, Nevada at 36¬∞ 34' 31.52\\"N, -116¬∞ 29' 35.52\\"W.

Transportation The principal highways serving Amargosa Valley are U.S. Route 95 which runs north‚Äìsouth (NE-SW as it passes through Amargosa) connecting Las Vegas and Reno, and State Route 373, which runs north‚Äìsouth connecting Amargosa Valley to Death Valley Junction via California State Route 127. Recreation thumb Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge features approximately 23,000 acres (93 km¬≤) of spring-fed wetlands and is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge provides habitat for at least 24 plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. Four fish (Devil's Hole Pupfish, Amargosa Pupfish, Warm Springs Pupfish, and Ash Meadows Speckled Dace), one insect (Ash Meadows Naucorid), and one plant (Amargosa Niterwort) are currently listed as endangered species.

Early years Vincent Tabone was the son of Niccol√≤ and Elisa Tabone, the youngest of ten children. His paternal grandmother, Giuseppina De Gaetani, had settled in Valletta in the mid-19th century from Riposto, Sicily. His father, Niccol√≤, was one of the first Maltese doctors to read pathology and surgery in the United Kingdom, and served as a District Medical Officer in various parts of Gozo. Life on Gozo for the Tabone family was relatively quiet and pastoral. They lived in Victoria and spent their summers in Marsalforn. Tabone's childhood was deeply affected by the sudden death of his father in 1922 at the age of 59. Two years later, at the age of 11, he was shipped off to Malta, where he became a boarder at St. Aloysius College, a Jesuit school. He entered the University of Malta in 1930, where he graduated as a pharmacist in 1933 and as a Doctor of Medicine in 1937. Military service and medical career During World War II, he served as a Regimental Medical Officer and general duty officer with the Royal Malta Artillery, and later as trainee ophthalmic specialist stationed at the Military Hospital, Mtarfa. In the early days of the War, he narrowly escaped tragedy when a bomb fell at Fort Saint Elmo, demolishing a substantial part of the army barracks to which he had been posted. In 1946, he obtained a diploma in Ophthalmology from the University of Oxford, followed by a diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery from the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was a clinical assistant at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.Ophthalmology in Malta, C. Savona-Ventura, University of Malta, 2003 In 1948, Tabone was entrusted with the supervision of a campaign to treat trachoma using sulfonamide tablets and drops. Through his efforts, the disease was virtually eliminated from the Island of Gozo. He helped launch similar campaigns in Taiwan, Indonesia and Iraq under the auspices of the World Health Organization, and subsequently served as a member and consultant of the WHO's International Panel of Trachoma Experts. He served on the Council of the University of Malta, and between 1957 and 1960 he was a faculty member of the Board of Medicine, and a lecturer in Clinical Ophthalmology in the Department of Surgery. He helped found the Medical Association of Malta in 1954 and was for a time its Honorary President.Medical Association of Malta For many years, even as he served as a Member of Parliament, he maintained his medical practice in Sliema. Political career Tabone was elected to the Executive Committee of the Nationalist Party in 1961. He later served as the party's Secretary General (1962‚Äì1972) and as Deputy Leader (1972‚Äì1977). Tabone was first elected to Parliament in 1966 and subsequently served as a Member of Parliament for the Sliema, St. Julian's, Msida, and Gzira areas for 23 years. During this time, he also served as the Minister of Labour, Employment and Welfare (1966‚Äì1971) and Minister for Foreign Affairs (1987‚Äì1989). In 1968, Tabone brought a motion before the United Nations calling for an action plan in regard to the world's aging population. In 1988, he brought another motion before the UN, calling for the world's climate to be declared the common heritage of mankind. Death On 14 March 2012, Tabone died at his home in St. Julian's, Malta at age 98. He died 16 days shy of his 99th birthday.

His 1903 book, The History of American Sculpture, was the first survey of the subject and stood for decades as the standard reference. He has been credited with helping to advance the status of women as sculptors. Taft was the father of U.S. Representative Emily Taft Douglas, father-in-law to her husband, U.S. Senator Paul Douglas, and a distant relative of U.S. President William Howard Taft. Early years and education Taft at work on Fountain of the Great Lakes in 1913 in Lorado Taft Midway Studios Taft was born in Elmwood, Illinois. His parents were Don Carlos Taft and Mary Lucy Foster.Who's Who in America 1904 page 1850 His father was a professor of geology at the Illinois Industrial University (later renamed the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign). He lived much of his childhood at 601 E. John Street, Champaign, Illinois, near the center of the UIUC campus. The house, now known as the Taft House was built by his father in 1873. It was purchased by the university in 1949 and moved about one mile southeast. After being homeschooled by his parents, Taft earned his bachelor's degree (1879) and master's degree (1880) at Illinois Industrial University. After his master's degree, he left for Paris to study sculpture, attending the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts from 1880 to 1883, where he studied with Augustin Dumont, Jean-Marie Bonnassieux, and Gabriel Thomas. His record there was outstanding; he was cited as \\"top man\\" in his studio and twice exhibited at the Salon. Career =Sculptor and educator= Upon returning to the United States in 1886, Taft settled in Chicago. He taught at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago until 1929. In addition to work in clay and plaster, Taft taught his students marble carving, and had them work on group projects. He also lectured at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois. The Recording Angel, 1923 In 1892, while the art community of Chicago was preparing for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, chief architect Daniel Burnham expressed concern to Taft that the sculptural adornments to the buildings might not be finished on time. Taft asked if he could employ some of his female students as assistants (it was not socially accepted for women to work as sculptors at that time) for the Horticultural Building. Burnham responded, \\"Hire anyone, even white rabbits, if they'll do the work.\\" From that arose a group of talented women sculptors known as \\"the White Rabbits\\", which included Enid Yandell, Carol Brooks MacNeil, Bessie Potter Vonnoh, Janet Scudder, Julia Bracken, and Ellen Rankin Copp. Later, another former student, Frances Loring, noted that Taft used his students' talents to further his own career, a not- uncommon situation. In general, history has given Taft credit for helping to advance the status of women as sculptors. =Lectures and writings= As Taft grew older, his eloquence and compelling writing led him, along with Frederick Ruckstull, to the forefront of sculpture's conservative ranks, where he often served as a spokesperson against the modern and abstract trends that developed during his lifetime. Taft's frequent lecture tours for the Chautauqua gave him a broad, popular celebrity status. Part of the Fountain of Creation (1933, unfinished), at the Library of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In some settings, Taft is better known for his writings than for his sculpture. In 1903, Taft published The History of American Sculpture, the first survey of the subject. The revised 1925 version was to remain the standard reference on the subject until Wayne Craven published Sculpture in America in 1968. In 1921, Taft published Modern Tendencies in Sculpture, a compilation of his lectures given at the Art Institute of Chicago. At the time, it offered a distinct perspective on the development of European sculpture; today, the book continues to be regarded as an excellent survey of American sculpture in the early years of the 20th century. =Associations= In 1898, Taft was a founding member of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony in the small town of Oregon, Illinois. Taft designed the Columbus Fountain at Union Station in Washington, D.C., in collaboration with Daniel Burnham. Taft was a member of the National Academy of Design, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters; he headed the National Sculpture Society in the 1920s, exhibiting at both their 1923 and 1929 shows, and he served on the Board of Art Advisors of Illinois. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1925 to 1929, and was an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. His papers reside in collections at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art, the University of Illinois, and the Art Institute of Chicago. He maintained his connections with his alma mater throughout his life. (His association with the University is commemorated by a street named in his honor.) In 1929, he dedicated his sculpture Alma Mater on the University of Illinois campus. Taft envisioned his Alma Mater as a benign and magnificent woman, about high and dressed in classical draperies, rising from a throne and advancing a step forward with outstretched arms in a gesture of generous greeting to her children. Two figures behind her on either side represent the university's motto, Learning and Labor. =Final years= He received numerous awards, prizes, and honorary degrees. Taft was active until the end of his life. The week before he died, he attended the Quincy, Illinois, dedication ceremonies for his sculpture celebrating the Lincoln- Douglas debates. He died in his home studio in Chicago on October 30, 1936. Sculptor's body of work Taft may be best remembered for his various fountains. The University of Illinois Archives has a series of photographs of most of Lorado Taft's important works, including many of their construction and preliminary models. Fountain of Time (1910‚Äì22), Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois. Following more than a dozen years of work, Taft's Fountain of Time was unveiled at the west end of Chicago's Midway Plaisance in 1922. Based on poet Austin Dobson's lines ‚Äî \\"Time goes, you say? Ah no, Alas, time stays, we go.\\" The fountain shows a cloaked figure of time observing the stream of humanity flowing past. The Patriots (1932), Louisiana State Capitol, Baton Rouge. The last major commission that Taft completed was two groups for the front entrance to the Louisiana State Capitol Building, dedicated in 1932. He left unfinished a vast work to be called the Fountain of Creation which he planned to place at the opposite end of the Chicago Midway from the \\"Fountain of Time.\\" Parts of this work were donated to the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and are now at the library and Foellinger Auditorium. The University named a dormitory and a street in Taft's honor.Taft Hall and Taft Drive, In 1965, his Chicago workplace at 6016 Ingleside Avenue (he moved there in 1906, when the building consisted merely of a brick barn) was designated a National Historic Landmark as Lorado Taft Midway Studios. =Selected commissions= Lincoln the Lawyer (1929), Urbana, Illinois.

Taggart was elected auditor of Marion County, Indiana (1886‚Äì1894) and mayor of Indianapolis (1895 to 1901). His mayoral administration supported public improvements, most notably the formation of the city's park and boulevard system. He also served as a member of the Democratic National Committee (1900‚Äì1916) and as its chairman (1904‚Äì1908). Taggart was appointed to the U.S. Senate in March 1916, but lost the seat in the November election. Taggart, an Irish-born immigrant, came to the United States in 1861 at the age of five, grew up in Xenia, Ohio, and moved to Indiana as a teenager. After relocating to Indianapolis in 1877, he began a successful career as an hotelier, financier, and politician. As the party's county chairman during Grover Cleveland's 1888 presidential campaign, Taggart helped him carry Marion County over Republican Benjamin Harrison, the hometown candidate. As state chairman in 1892, Taggart helped Cleveland carry Indiana in opposition to Harrison's bid for reelection. In 1908 Taggart assisted in securing the Democratic nomination of John W. Kern for U.S. vice president and Thomas R. Marshall for governor of Indiana. He was also involved in securing the nomination of Woodrow Wilson for U.S. president and Marshall for vice president in 1912, as well as James M. Cox's nomination in the 1920 presidential election. In addition to his political activities, Taggart was the owner and developer of the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana; he also maintained a summer home at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Early life and family Thomas Taggart was born on November 17, 1856, to Thomas and Martha Kingsbury Taggart in Emyvale, County Monaghan, Ireland, and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1861 at the age of five. The Taggarts settled in Xenia, Ohio, where Thomas senior worked at a local railroad depot. Young Taggart left high school early to work full-time at the depot's hotel and restaurant. In 1875, when young Thomas was 18, his employer, the N. and G. Ohmer Company, sent him to Garrett, Indiana, to work in the restaurant at DeKalb House, a depot hotel. Thomas remained at Garrett until 1877, when he was transferred to Indianapolis, Indiana, to work as a clerk for the Ohmer company's dining hall/restaurant at the city's Union Depot. Known as a hard worker, Taggart became the depot restaurant's manager and eventually its sole owner in the new Union Station.Fadely \\"Desperate Hope,\\" p. 7. See also: In 1878, a year after his move to Indianapolis, Taggart married Eva Dora Bryant (1853‚Äì1937), whom he met while living in Garrett. Thomas and his wife were the parents of six children, five daughters and one son. Florence Eva (1878‚Äì1899) died tragically in a yachting accident in the Gulf of Mexico; Lucy Martha (1880‚Äì1960) became an accomplished artist and art educator at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis; Nora (born 1881), a Vassar College graduate, married David L. Chambers, who became president and chairman of the Bobbs-Merrill Company; Irene Mary (born 1883) married a physician from Louisville, Kentucky; Emily Letitia (born 1888) married William R. Sinclair, an executive with Kingan and Company, an Indianapolis-based meatpacker; and Thomas Douglas (born 1886) graduated from Yale University and in 1912 assumed management of the French Lick Springs Hotel. Thomas and Eva Taggart also had nine grandchildren.Fadely \\"Desperate Hope,\\" pp. 7, 9; Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 16, 18, 23. The Taggart family's primary residence was in Indianapolis, where they built a new home at 1331 North Delaware Street in 1913. The large home included a Georgian Colonial exterior and an Italian- style interior. It was selected as one of House Beautiful's three best homes in Indianapolis in 1920.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" p. 19. The Taggarts were members of Saint Paul Episcopal Church in Indianapolis. In 1901, after Taggart and a group of investors purchased the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana, the Taggart family frequently visited the hotel. Its seven-story deluxe wing, completed in 1915, provided accommodations for the family when they were in residence. The family also had a summer home built in 1915‚Äì16 at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The home was called Amyvale, in honor of Taggart's Irish birthplace. In 1928 Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy acquired property adjacent to the Taggarts' Hyannis Port home to establish the Kennedy compound. The Taggarts' Hyannis Port home was sold after Eva's death, in 1937.Fadely \\"Desperate Hope,\\" p. 9; Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 19, 23. Career After his move to Indianapolis in 1877, Taggart began a successful career as an Indiana hotelier, financier, and politician. Taggart became the owner of the restaurant at the Indianapolis Union Station, but sold his restaurant business and began other ventures that included acquisition of two hotels in Indianapolis and the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana, among other investments. Taggart also became a \\"powerful Democratic boss of the state,\\" often referred to by his initials, T. T., or called \\"the Easy Boss\\" because of his congenial nature.Fadely \\"Desperate Hope,\\" p. 5. Taggart was elected auditor of Marion County, Indiana (1886‚Äì1894) and mayor of Indianapolis (1895‚Äì1901). As the Democratic Party's boss in Indiana, a member of Democratic National Committee (1900‚Äì1916), and the party's national chairman (1904‚Äì1908), Taggart also became an influential political figure in state and national politics. In 1916 Taggart was appointed U.S. Senator, but he was defeated later that year in a special election.Chapter 4 in =Hotelier= After Taggart sold his restaurant business at the Indianapolis Union Station, his investments expanded to include controlling interests in the Grand and Denison hotels in Indianapolis and investments in the copper, gas, and oil industries. In 1901 Taggart began his most ambitious and famous project when he organized a small group of investors that acquired and developed the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana.Steelwater, p. 56; Fadely, Thomas Taggart, pp. xii and 57. In addition to Taggart, the group included William McDoel, president of the Monon Railroad; Crawford Fairbanks, a Terre Haute brewery owner; and Colonel Livingston T. Dickson, owner of \\"quarry and mineral interests in Indiana and Illinois.\\"Fadely, Thomas Taggart, p. 63. Around 1905 Taggart bought his partners' interests in the mineral springs hotel to become its sole owner. Under Taggart's direction, the property was transformed into a first-class spa and a renowned gambling resort. Taggart made improvements and additions to the hotel, its mineral springs, and the resort's grounds. He also modernized the facilities, established trolley service to French Lick, and convinced the Monon Railroad to lay a spur track to the hotel's grounds and run daily passenger service to Chicago.Steelwater, pp. 5‚Äì6; 22‚Äì26. See also: At the height of the resort's popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, the hotel provided more than $2 million in annual profits.Bunting, p. 45. Although casino gambling was illegal under Indiana law, it flourished the Orange County area from the early 1900s until the mid-1940s, during the time the Taggart family managed the French Lick Springs Hotel, and contributed to the resort's popularity. Several casinos were in operation within Orange County, but Taggart disassociated himself with any connection to these local gambling establishments and denied any involvement in illegal gambling operations.Fadely, Thomas Taggart, pp. 74‚Äì76. =Politician= Taggart, who was a Democrat, became active in local politics in Indianapolis in the 1880s. He was elected auditor of heavily Republican Marion County in 1886, reelected in 1890, and served in that capacity until 1894. During that time Taggart also served as the Democratic Party chairman at the city, county, and state levels. As the county chairman during the presidential campaign of 1888, his efforts helped Grover Cleveland carry Marion County over native son Benjamin Harrison, the first time the county had voted Democratic in a Presidential election. As state chairman in 1892, Taggart helped Cleveland carry Indiana to challenge Harrison's bid for reelection.Fadely, \\"Desperate Hope,\\" p. 7. From 1895 to 1901, Taggart served three two-year terms as the mayor of Indianapolis. He defeated Republican Preston C. Trusler in 1895, William M. Harding in 1897 and Charles A. Bookwalter in 1899. During his mayoralty, Taggart's administration emphasized efficient use of the city's funds and civic improvements that included acquisition of more than along the White River to establish the city's park and boulevard system. Although the city's then-growing African American population generally supported Republicans until the New Deal, Indianapolis lawyers Alexander E. Manning (who became president of the National League of Negro Democrats in 1896) and James T.V. Hill were Taggart's liaisons with their community, which helped elect and re-elect Taggart.Bodenhamer-Barrows p.242 Taggart remained active in national and state politics until his death in 1929. He served on the Democratic National Committee from 1900 to 1916 and as its chairman from 1904 to 1908. As the party's national chairman, Taggart ran Judge Alton B. Parker's campaign in the presidential election in 1904, but Parker lost to Theodore Roosevelt. Taggart played a key role in securing John W. Kern's Democratic nomination for U.S. vice president and Thomas R. Marshall's nomination for governor of Indiana in 1908, as well as Woodrow Wilson's nomination for U.S. president and Marshall's vice presidential nomination in 1912 at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 1317. On March 20, 1916, Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston appointed Taggart, his political ally, to the U.S. Senate to fill a seat left vacant by the death of Benjamin F. Shively. Taggart advocated efficient use of federal funds and opposed wasteful spending, although his time in the Senate was brief. That November proved a Republican sweep and Taggart lost the Senate seat to James E. Watson. In 1920 Taggart helped James M. Cox win the Democratic nomination in the presidential election. Cox reciprocated by supporting Taggart's challenge to regain the Senate seat from Watson, but again Republicans swept in the November general election: Warren G. Harding defeated Cox and Taggart lost to Watson . In 1924 Taggart had nearly secured Samuel Ralston's nomination as the Democratic candidate in the presidential election before Ralston withdrew from the race for health reasons. In Indiana's gubernatorial campaign that year, Taggart endorsed Carleton B. McCulloch, but McCulloch lost the election to Edward L. Jackson, who enjoyed strong Ku Klux Klan support and carried all but two of Indiana's 92 counties.Fadely, Thomas Taggart, pp. 185, 189‚Äì90, 195; Gugin, and St. Clair, eds., p. 276. Later years Taggart's health declined in the 1920s, but he remained active in national and state politics and civil affairs until his death in Indianapolis in 1929. He served as chairman of the board of directors of American Fletcher National Bank (1925‚Äì1929); as a director of the Indianapolis, Light, Heat, and Power Company; and treasurer of the Indiana Lincoln Union. He was also a member of the George Rogers Clark Memorial Commission. Death and legacy Taggart died on March 6, 1929. After a brief funeral service in the dining room of his North Delaware Street home in Indianapolis, he was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery. His gravesite is near those of his wife, Eva, and four of their children (Florence, Lucy, Irene, and Thomas). The Taggart family burial plot is in Section Three of the cemetery and marked with a tall, gray obelisk. Following his death in 1929, Taggart's son, Thomas Douglas, became owner of the French Lick Springs Hotel property and buildings valued at nearly $2 million.Steelwater, p. 57. Taggart is considered the \\"undisputed boss of the Democratic machine for the first quarter of the twentieth century\\"Fadely \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" p. 18. and \\"one of Indiana‚Äôs most dominant political figures.\\" He is also remembered for his support of public improvements as mayor of Indianapolis, most notably the formation of city's public park and boulevard system.

This declaration is also called the ‚ÄúJapan-South Korean Joint Declaration of 1998‚Äù.  Background  ROK President Kim Dae-Jung = Immediate Background = In February 1998, when Kim Dae-jung became the president of South Korea, Japan- South Korea relations were at its worst. With both countries unable to come to an agreement about issues such as the Dokdo/Takeshima, comfort women, and fishing, relations between the two countries continued to worsen. Kim Dae- jung, unlike the former president Kim Young-Sam, who was very critical about the Japanese government, actively sought to have talks with Japan and set about preparing the Japan‚ÄìSouth Korea Joint Declaration of 1998 along with Japan. = Historical Background = An existing treaty between South Korea and Japan, the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, was signed on June 22, 1965 and provided basic diplomatic relations for the two states. In this treaty, signed by Japanese PM Eisaku Sat≈ç and the South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee, Japan and South Korea agreed upon settling problems with property during war-time, individual claims for compensation, and economic cooperation. Japan provided South Korea with $800 million, which would settle any issues about Imperial-era property and compensation for individuals. On July 6, 1992, Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato made an apology towards South Korea and to the wartime comfort women. Kato touched upon the remorse that Japan feels, along with hopes to build ‚Äúfuture-oriented‚Äù relations with South Korea. The \\"Murayama Statement\\", also called \\"On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the war's end\\", was a statement released on August 16, 1995 by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. This statement was mainly an apology regarding the damages that Japan caused to its neighboring countries during World War II. Similarly, on June 23, 1996, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto apologized about comfort women and announced that he and President Kim Young-sam had agreed that friendly relations between Japan and South Korea was ideal for not just in Asia, but also globally.  Details of the Agreement  Prior to agreeing to the Japan-South Korea Joint Declaration, in 1965, Although the two countries had signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965, the two leaders agreed to pursue the further development of their relations as neighbors. The Joint Declaration resulted in the following agreements. = Japan-South Korea Relations = * Cooperate between the peoples of Japan and South Korea for the success of the 2002 Soccer World Cup and to use the occasion of this event to further promote cultural and sports exchanges. * Recognize that Korean nationals residing in Japan could serve as a bridge for mutual exchanges and understanding between the peoples of Japan and South Korea as well as with continue the determinations of enhancing their social status. * Enhance the governmental programs for the exchange of students and youths including the introduction of such programs for junior and senior high school students, and that both governments would introduce a working holiday program for youths of both countries from April 1999. * President Kim Dae-jung conveyed his policy of opening South Korea to Japanese cultural imports (music, anime, manga, movies, television shows, books, etc.). * Commence talks on concluding a Japan-South Korea Extradition Treaty and further strengthen cooperation on countermeasures against international organized crime such as on illicit narcotics and stimulants. * Maintain and strengthen the mutual visits and the close consultations between them, to conduct these visits and consultations regularly and to further enhance Minister-level consultations in various areas, in particular those between their Foreign Ministers. = Economy = * Strengthen bilateral economic policy consultations as well as to further promote policy coordination between the two countries at such multilateral for a as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). * President Kim appreciated the economic assistance to South Korea from Japan in the past in a wide range of areas including finance, investment and technological transfer, and explained the efforts of South Korea to resolve its economic problems. * PM Obuchi expressed Japan's intention to continue support for the efforts being made by South Korea to overcome its economic difficulties. * Reached a basic agreement was reached on loans from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to South Korea which properly utilizes the fiscal investment and loan program. = Fishing = * Welcomed the negotiations on the new Japan-South Korea fisheries agreement, which had been a major outstanding issue between the two countries, had reached basic agreement, and expressed the hope that under the new fishing order based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, relations between Japan and South Korea in the area of fisheries would develop smoothly. = International Relations = * Shared the view that the role of the United Nations should be strengthened in order to respond more effectively to the challenges and tasks in the twenty-first century and that this could be achieved through strengthening the functions of the Security Council, increasing the efficiency of the United Nations Secretariat, ensuring a stable financial base, strengthening United Nations peace-keeping operations, cooperation for economic and social development in developing countries and other means. * Emphasized that all kinds of weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation posed a threat to the peace and security of the international community, and decided to further strengthen cooperation between Japan and South Korea in this field. = Problems regarding North Korea = * In order to achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, it was extremely important North Korea pursue reform and openness and take through dialogue a more constructive attitude. PM Obuchi expressed support for the policies of President Kim Dae-jung Regarding North Korea. * Confirmed the importance of maintaining the Agreed Framework signed in October 1994 between the United States of America and North Korea and the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) as the most realistic and effective mechanisms for preventing North Korea from advancing its nuclear program. * Reaffirmed that if the North Korea's missile development is left unchecked, it would adversely affect the peace and security of Japan, South Korea, and of the entire Northeast Asian region. * Shared the view that the implementation of the Agreement of Reconciliation, Non-aggression, Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and North, which entered into force in February 1992, and the smooth progress of the Four-Party Talks are desirable. = Environmental Problems = * Promote Japan-South Korea environmental policy dialogue in order to strengthen their cooperation on various issues concerning the global environment, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and countermeasures against acid rain.  Outcomes  = South Korea seeks destruction of Declaration in 2001 = On July 18, 2001, the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea made a resolution unanimously seeking the destruction of the Japan‚ÄìSouth Korea Joint Declaration of 1998. This resolution was the result of anti-Japanese emotions that were caused by then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting Yasukuni Shrine, along with Japanese history textbooks omitting details about facts related to issues such as Imperial Japanese war crimes and comfort women in the same year. When no action was taken by Japan to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù their textbooks, South Korea temporarily halted allowing Japanese cultural capital from coming into the country, which has been happening over five steps since the 1998 Joint Declaration. However, this did not result in the destruction of the 1998 Joint Declaration, after talks between then- President Roh Moo Hyun and then-Prime Minister Koizumi. The 4th step of allowing Japanese cultural imports into South Korea, which was temporarily stopped on July 12, 2001, resumed on January 1, 2004. = Commemoration = On October 9, 2018, the Commemorative Symposium for the 20th Anniversary of the Japan-South Korea Joint Declaration was held in Tokyo. This symposium was a way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Japan and South Korea signing the Joint Declaration in 1998, and effectively also an opportunity for Prime Minister Abe to talk about current Japan-South Korea relations. Abe emphasizes that the efforts from people like the past-Prime Minister Obuchi and past- President Kim Dae-jung have allowed the two countries to overcome obstacles regarding Japan-South Korea relations. Throughout his speech, Abe continuously uses the phrase ‚Äúfuture-oriented‚Äù, emphasizing his enthusiasm towards improving relations between the two countries.  Stances on History  = Japan = Japanese PM Keiz≈ç Obuchi The Japanese government's recognition towards historical issues such as the comfort women issue, war-time laborer issue, has been acknowledged in the ‚ÄúMurayama Statement‚Äù which was released on August 15, 1995, to apologize for the Japanese acts conducted in the Asia- Pacific region during the World War II. The following prime ministers has issued similar statements, including the ‚ÄúKoizumi Statement‚Äù on August 15, 2005, and ‚ÄúAbe Statement‚Äù made on August 14, 2015. In the Japan‚ÄìSouth Korea Joint Declaration of 1998, Prime Minister Obuchi made his feelings of remorse and apology clear, as to all the damage and suffering that had been done during Japan's colonial rule. In terms of the comfort women issue, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have mentioned the following: The government recognizes and apologizes to all those women known as comfort women who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds. The government of Japan has legally settled all issues of reparations, properties and claims arising from the war, and has extended maximum cooperation to the Asian Women's Fund which implemented ‚Äúmedical and welfare support projects‚Äù and provided ‚Äúatonement money‚Äù to offer realistic relief to comfort women who are now advanced in years (the Asian Women's Fund has been disbanded in March 2007). The Abe Statement made on August 14, 2015, states that ‚Äúwe must never forget that there were women behind the battlefields whose honor and dignity were severely injured. It is also stated that we will engrave in our hearts the past, when the dignity and honor of many women were severely injured during wars in the 20th century, and Japan will lead the world in making the 21st century an era in which women‚Äôs human rights are not infringed upon. Japan and South Korea reached an agreement on December 28, 2015 in Seoul where the two Foreign Ministers reached an agreement regarding the issue of comfort women and confirmed that the issue is resolved ‚Äúfinally and irreversibly‚Äù. = Republic of Korea = In the Joint Declaration, President Kim expressed his feelings of appreciation for PM Obuchi's attitude. He also suggested to build a future-oriented relationship, and to move forward with the historical issue. However, the current South Korean government has been skeptical of the Japanese government's attitude towards the historical issues which occurred in World War II, especially regarding the comfort women issue and the war-time laborers issue. ROK President Moon Jae-in has criticized the bilateral agreement of 2015 which was signed between Japan and South Korea and has brought it upon the Republic of Korea's Constitutional Court on the validity of this diplomatic agreement. However, on December 27, 2019, the Republic of Korea Constitutional Court declined to rule on the validity of the 2015 agreement made between the two nations, and has concluded that the agreement does not infringe upon the constitution of either countries.  Issues raised by the Agreement  During the meeting that concluded in the Joint Declaration between Japan and South Korea in 1998, an apology addressing past transgressions on the Japanese side was issued from PM Obuchi Keizo to ROK President Kim Dae-jung. = Perspectives on Historical Issues = Overall, the declaration does not mention in detail the exact stances on major historical issues; it fails to mention any specific historical wrongdoings and clarify stances on historical events. At the time, PM Obuchi faced difficulties in producing a clear narrative on the historical issues with ROK due to inconsistency within the Japanese government and the leading political party LDP. PM Obuchi therefore made use of the previous statement issued by Murayama Tomiichi in 1995, also known as the Murayama Statement, which was the first ever apology issued by a Japanese prime minister that specifically mentions the words ‚Äòcolonial rule‚Äô, and President Kim Dae-jung was thus inclined to accept and move on. = Textbook Issue = Another point with the declaration that has been raised is the lack of enforcement and apparent emergence of the textbook issue. In the second section that outlines the agreements made between Japan and ROK in 1998, it is written that ‚Äúboth leaders shared the view that it was important that the peoples both countries, the young generation in particular, deepen their understanding of history, and stressed the need to devote much attention and effort to that end‚Äù. Although Japanese textbooks covered the comfort women issue during the 1990s, it is reported that they no longer contain information on the issue, which may contribute further to the current issues between ROK and Japan.  Relation to 1998 Jiang Zemin State visit in Tokyo  On November 25, 1998, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (1989-2002) and China's president (1993-2003) Jiang Zemin and his wife made a state visit to Japan that lasted for five days. President Jiang Zemin and his wife spent three days in Tokyo, from which they traveled north to visit Sendai and Sapporo before departing from Sapporo on November 30. During this state visit, the Chinese had hoped for a stronger expression of apology, such as the apology that PM Obuchi had issued President Kim Dae-jung the month before. Prior to the state visit, a Chinese official had expressed that the apology issued to ROK would be satisfactory if issued similarly to China by changing the words ‚ÄòKorean people‚Äô and ‚Äòcolonial rule‚Äô to ‚ÄòChinese people‚Äô and ‚Äòaggression‚Äô. China was never issued any written apology in the Joint Declaration such as the one issued to ROK, and President Jiang Zemin was instead given an oral apology by Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo that was complemented by a written statement in the declaration that expressed ‚Äúdeep remorse‚Äù over past wartime atrocities. The Chinese side was disappointed that they had not received the apology they expected, and President Jiang Zemin expressed his frustration with the Japanese leaders during the state banquet hosted by Emperor Akihito on November 26, and several times more during his November 28 speech at Waseda University and later that same day during his news conference that was held in Tokyo. The state visit has thus come to be remembered as one of the worst state visits in Japanese public memory.

He served as the Prime Minister of Jordan between 1960 and 1970 for six different terms. Talhouni was Prime Minister from August 1969 to June 1970, during a particularly turbulent time of friction and skirmishes between the Government and thousands of Palestinian guerrillas who were then in Jordan. The Palestinian guerrillas, members of various organizations, frequently disregarded Jordanian laws and came to be almost a state within a state. In February 1970, King Hussein of Jordan met with their leaders at Talhouni's house in Amman. At that meeting the King agreed not to enforce restrictions on the Palestinians carrying firearms in Jordanian towns, and the leaders of the guerrillas promised to try to make their followers less unruly. A strained and often interrupted truce ensued. Then came an unsuccessful attempt on the King's life in June. Angered, the Jordanian Army called loudly for a crackdown on the Palestinians. But as a biographer of the King, Peter Snow, wrote in 1972, \\"Talhouni wavered; like Hussein, he was not eager to be responsible for the order that could lead to wide-scale bloodshed.\\" Late in June 1970, the King replaced Talhouni with a new Prime Minister, Abdel Moneim Rifai, a champion of reconciliation with the Palestinians. But skirmishes between the Army, which stayed loyal to the King, and the Palestinians escalated into civil war in September 1970. The King let the Army crush the fighters, and by the following summer they had been nullified as a military force in Jordan. In addition to serving as Prime Minister, over the years Talhouni held the posts of Minister of the Interior and of Justice, chief of the Royal Court, and served as a legislator and personal representative of the King. He was born in Ma'an, in what is now southern Jordan, and studied law in Syria. He served as president of the Court of Appeals in Amman before becoming Minister of the Interior in 1953. He served as the President of the Senate of Jordan from December 1974 to January 1983. Talhouni died on January 30, 1994, as announced by the Jordanian Government announced. He was 81.

Its clubhouse and boat house are located on the edge of the northern Beira Lake, at Sir Chittapalam A. Gardiner Mawatha (formerly Parsons Road), in Colombo. Since its inception the Colombo Rowing Club has progressed into one of the most prestigious and active private member clubs in Sri Lanka. A distinctive feature has been that while the club's main sporting focus remains in rowing, social interaction and fellowship is also an important aspect. The club claims to be the cradle of rowing in Sri Lanka since most affiliated clubs of the Amateur Rowing Association of Sri Lanka, governing body for rowing in Sri Lanka, started from the facilities and infrastructure that is available at the Colombo Rowing Club. History The club was founded on the July 15, 1864 by Sir Edward Creasy, the former Chief Justice of Ceylon and based on available records, the CRC claims to be the oldest club in the island. The Colombo Rowing Club adopted the club colours of Oxford: Oxford Blue and White. The membership of club was predominately made up on colonialists affiliated with the many government departments and plantations in the island. In 1898, the first Boat Race took place between the Colombo Rowing Club and the Madras Boat Club (now Chennai, India) and rivalry prevails until the present day. Thus, the boat race is considered second in vintage only to the prestigious Oxford and Cambridge boat race which is the world's oldest, continuing inter- institutional event. With Ceylon gaining independence the club was opened up to more locals and Alavi Mohomed was selected as the first Ceylonese captain of the Club. In the 1950s and 1960s the club helped to introduce the sport to Royal College, S' Thomas' College and University of Colombo. The Club has hosted the annual Royal Thomian Regatta since 1962. The club commemorated its centenary year in 1964. The Colombo Rowing Club and the surrounding Beira Lake have hosted the Sri Lanka National Rowing Championships on twenty-four occasions till 2008. The National Championships have since moved to Bolgoda Lake which boasts a 2000m international distance course. Present situation There are 14 institutions currently using the facilities at the Colombo Rowing Club and the club extends all levels of support for the development of rowing. The club hosts many as 7 regattas throughout the year catering to novices, intermediates and senior oarsmen/women. The current president is Pravir Samarasinghe with Ishika De Silva as captain.

Tanner was the first governor in the country to be openly neutral in labor disputes, gaining national notoriety for his actions in a series of coal mine disputes. With the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War looming, he was the only governor to raise and combat-equip a National Guard unit of African American soldiers led by African American officers. Tanner's administration was capable and efficient, placing the state on a sound financial footing and passing significant legislation. However, he was constantly at odds with Chicago's political leaders, both Democratic and Republican, a feud that came to be symbolized by his signing of the infamous \\"Allen bill\\", which gave control of Chicago's intra-city transportation network to corrupt financier Charles Yerkes. Tanner declined to seek a second term as governor, instead choosing to oppose the renomination of his former political ally, Shelby Cullom, as U.S. Senator. Tanner was badly defeated within his own party, ending his political career. He died less than five months after leaving office.  Early life  John Riley Tanner was born on a farm near the town of Boonville in Warrick County, Indiana. His family moved to Illinois when he was a child, and he grew up on a farm near Carbondale. He enlisted in the 98th Illinois Infantry at the age of 19, during the Civil War, and saw service with Sherman's army. When the 98th Infantry was mustered out of service in June 1865, Tanner was transferred to the 61st Illinois Infantry, and was mustered out of service later that year. He then returned to southern Illinois and settled in Louisville, Illinois, where he farmed and entered into a partnership with his brother in a milling and lumber business. He married Lauretta Ingraham on Christmas Day 1866 and they had two children, Lucinda J. and J. Mack Tanner, but Lauretta died on October 22, 1887, at the age of 40.  Political rise  Tanner would rise through Republican party ranks to become the unrivaled boss of a powerful political machine. In 1870 he began his long and successful political career in the Illinois Republican party of that era, winning elections and garnering appointments to increasingly important positions. He was first elected to the office of sheriff of Clay County, Illinois (1870‚Äì72), and afterwards became circuit court clerk for the county (1872‚Äì76). He was appointed master in chancery (i.e., a senior officer of the court) of the circuit court (1877‚Äì80), and then served two terms in the Illinois State Senate (1880‚Äì1883). Tanner was appointed United States marshal of the Southern District of Illinois by Republican President Chester A. Arthur, but was soon removed by incoming Democratic President Grover Cleveland. Now prominent in statewide Illinois politics, Tanner was elected State Treasurer in 1886, and in 1891 he was appointed to the State Railroad and Warehouse Commission. In 1892 he was made Assistant Treasurer of the United States Treasury at Chicago, and was elected chairman of the Illinois State Republican Central Committee in 1894, a committee on which he had previously served as a member (1874‚Äì84). As chairman, Tanner was at the head of his party in its heyday of state power and national influence, the boss of a well-oiled political machine that he had helped build. As such, he was instrumental in resuscitating the flagging political fortunes of U.S. Senator Shelby Moore Cullom within his own Republican party. Tanner was a tireless worker and strong-willed party boss. Under his leadership during the 1896 political campaign, the entire Illinois Republican Party state ticket was elected, the party secured majorities in both branches of the state legislature, and eighteen of their twenty-two candidates for congressmen were elected. Tanner himself was elected governor, defeating incumbent John Peter Altgeld by a wide margin.  Administration  Cora English Tanner, wife of the governor. Tanner led up to his inauguration in grand style with his marriage to the socially prominent Cora English on December 30, 1896. She was known for her interest in social reform and her outspoken support of her ideals, views that were shared by her husband. John Tanner's administration was noteworthy in several respects. He placed the state on a sound financial footing, and significant legislation included the establishment of the State Board of Pardons, the State Board of Examiners of Architects, the offices of the State Food Commissioners and the State Commissioners of Game, and the Juvenile Court Act. Western Normal School was established at Macomb (originally a school for teachers, now Western Illinois University). Tanner was also known for his antagonistic relationship with Chicago, and was often at loggerheads with its political bosses, both Democratic and Republican. The mutual hostility came to be symbolized by the \\"Allen bill\\", a legislation signed by Tanner which gave control of Chicago's intra-city transportation system to corrupt financier Charles Yerkes. Faced with long-term constraints that would virtually cripple many efforts to develop the city, Chicago was galvanized into instituting internal reforms and ensuring the bill's repeal. Tanner was an active and unbiased patriot. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was declared, he was the first governor in the country to have the state militia ready to be called up into national service. Within 36 hours of President McKinley's call for volunteers, ten thousand equipped troops were ready for muster into the U.S. military. Among Illinois' contributions were the 8th Illinois Volunteers, an African American regiment with African American officers and an African American commander; and when the President tried to dissuade him from recruiting African Americans, Tanner used his considerable influence to pressure the national government into calling up the regiment and sending them to Cuba, one of ten equipped Illinois regiments to be called up. Tanner achieved national notoriety with his position on labor disputes at a time when they were characteristically numerous and violent, particularly in the Illinois coalfields. His position was non-partisanship, the first governor to make it a state policy. When violence broke out, he was quick to send state troops to quell the violence, and he was adamantly opposed to the importation of armed men by either side, using troops to enforce state laws against it. The most notable incidents of the day were at Virden (where imported armed men had fired on Illinois strikers), at Pana (racial strife between white and black coal miners, with the governor siding against the position of the white miners), and Carterville (where unarmed African Americans were shot by white miners, an incident vehemently condemned by the governor).  Legacy  John Tanner's tomb at Oak Ridge Cemetery Tanner's early and untimely death meant that he would never be able to mend the ill feelings that resulted from his disputes within his own party, particularly those that arose from his challenge to Shelby Cullom immediately preceding his death. His relationship with Chicago politicians had been consistently antagonistic over the years, and they felt no inclination to remember him kindly. He had personally opposed the use of violence against both companies and laborers in labor disputes, and had favored the elevation of African Americans from an inferior social position to one of equality. As neither principle was actively supported by successful politicians of either party, either before or after his term as governor, it is fair to attribute the principles to him personally, and to note that he was out-of-step with his nineteenth century contemporaries. Tanner is affectionately remembered both by Organized Labor, and by the African Americans who benefited from his policies. Their donations in remembrance of him accounts for the grand tomb that was erected at his grave.

The highest point, Chiricahua Peak, rises above sea level, approximately above the surrounding valleys. The Chiricahua Mountains, and other associated ranges, along with Sulphur Springs Valley on the west and the San Simon Valley on the east, form the eastern half of Cochise County in southeast Arizona. The Pedregosa Mountains are found at the southern end of the Chiricahua Mountains, while the Swisshelm Mountains are located to the southwest. The northwest end of the Chiricahua mountains continue as the Dos Cabezas Mountains beyond Apache Pass and the Fort Bowie National Historic Site.

Most of the range lies within the 87,700 acre Chiricahua Wilderness, managed by the Coronado National Forest.Chiricahua Wilderness Coronado National Forest History The earliest evidence of humans in the vicinity of the Chiricahua Mountains are Clovis archeological sites such as Double Adobe Site in the Whitewater Draw tributary of Rucker Creek north of Douglas. Subsequently, the Cochise culture another pre-ceramic based culture spanning 3000 - 200 BCE was defined from sites around the Chiricahua Mountains, including Cave Creek Canyon. Following the transition to ceramics, artifacts characteristic of both Mogollon culture and its local variants, the Mimbres culture, are found. These relics span the period from 150 BCE - 1450. The influx of other indigenous peoples, such as the Chiricahua Apaches, including the leaders Cochise and Geronimo occupied the area until forced removal in the late 19th century.

V. Devan Nair, was a Malaysian‚ÄìSingaporean politician. He served as the third President of Singapore & the commander-in-chief of the Singapore Armed Forces serving a three-year term from 23 October 1981 to 28 March 1985. He was elected by the Parliament of Singapore to be the next President of Singapore after former president Benjamin Henry Sheares died on 12 May that year. Nair was sworn in as president on 23 October 1981. On 28 March 1985, Nair resigned in unclear circumstances. Nair was a member of parliament for Anson from 1979 to 1981 and a member of Bungsar, Selangor from 1964 to 1969. He was the Secretary-General of the Malaysian People's Action Party in 1965 and 1st Secretary-General of DAP in 1965 to 1967 before being elected as the President of Singapore by the Parliament of Singapore. Early life Born on August 5, 1923 in Malacca, he was the son of a rubber plantation clerk, Illathu Veettil Karunakaran Nair, who was originally from Thalassery, Kerala. He and his family migrated to Singapore when he was 10 years old and he received his primary education at Rangoon Road Primary School before enrolling in Victoria School for his secondary education where he passed his Senior Cambridge examination in 1940. His disdain for colonial rule was apparent in those days, as he changed the lyrics of Rule Britannia to anti-British ones in a school choir performance before a British guest-of-honour. Career After the second World War, Nair became a Normal Trained teacher and taught at St Joseph's Institution and later, at St Andrew's School. In 1949, he became General Secretary of the Singapore Teachers' Union. Initially, a member of the Communist Anti-British League, he joined Lee Kuan Yew's People's Action Party (PAP) in 1954. Nair was detained in 1951 by the British for anticolonial activities. In 1956, Devan Nair was detained again under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance Act together with unionists Lim Chin Siong and James Puthucheary as suspected Communist subversives after the Chinese middle schools riots. Nair was released in 1959 when the PAP won the elections in a landslide victory. He was subsequently appointed political secretary to the Minister for Education. He returned to teaching after a year. In 1960, he became the chairman of the Prisons Inquiry Commission and launched the Adult Education Board. He was the only PAP member to win in the 1964 Malaysian general election, winning the Bangsar constituency, near Kuala Lumpur. He stayed in Malaysia after the Separation, forming the Democratic Action Party, but returned to Singapore to lead the National Trades Union Congress, the labour union movement which he helped establish in 1961. He and P.P. Narayanan were advocates for the concerns of developing countries and voiced their concerns at the ICFTU as they saw economic and social policy documents that were biased towards industrialized nations. They wanted greater attention paid to extreme poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment of their countries. These proposals were accepted and later reflected in the work of ICFTU's Economic and Social Committee. He entered the Singapore Parliament in 1979 by winning the Anson seat in a by-election and retained the seat in the 1980 general election, but resigned the seat in 1981 to accept the largely ceremonial office of President. This resulted in a by-election of the Anson seat which was then won by opposition leader Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, the first time in Singapore since 1963 when an opposition party candidate won a Parliament seat. During his imprisonment in the 1950s, he read the writings of Sri Aurobindo, particularly the Life Divine and became his lifelong admirer and disciple. He visited Pondicherry and nearby Auroville a number of times and wrote and spoke on Sri Aurobindo's vision in the United States, Canada and other countries. Resignation On 28 March 1985, Nair resigned in unclear circumstances. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong stated in Parliament that Nair resigned to get treatment for alcoholism, a charge Nair hotly denied. According to Nair's counterclaim, he resigned under pressure when their political views came into conflict and Goh threatened him during a game of chess to oust him as president. Nair also alleged that he was fed drugs to make him appear disoriented and that rumours were spread about his personal life in an attempt to discredit him. In 1999, an article about the case in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail resulted in a libel suit by Goh. Some claimed that the suit was thrown out of court after Nair's counterclaim. However, in a letter to The New York Times, it is said that Goh agreed to discontinue the suit only when two of Nair's sons issued a statement, reported in The Globe and Mail on 1 July 2004, maintaining that Nair was no longer mentally competent to give evidence in court. The Globe and Mail statement concluded that \\"having reviewed the records, and on the basis of the family's knowledge of the circumstances leading to Mr. Nair's resignation as President of Singapore in March 1985, we can declare that there is no basis for this allegation (of Mr Nair being drugged).\\" Post-presidency, death and legacy After his resignation as President, Nair and his wife migrated first to the United States in 1988 where they settled in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Then later they moved to Bloomington, Indiana. The couple later moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where they lived out for the rest of their lives. His wife, Avadai Dhanam, died on 18 April 2005 in Hamilton, whilst Nair, who had developed severe dementia, died on 6 December of the same year as his wife in Hamilton, Canada. The Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability located in Jurong East was opened on 1 May 2014 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to recognise his contributions to the labour movement when he was Secretary General of National Trades Union Congress. Family Nair is survived by his daughter, three sons, and five grandchildren. His eldest son, Janadas Devan, was a senior editor with the Singapore newspaper The Straits Times and is currently the Chief of Government Communications at the Ministry of Communications and Information of Singapore and also a director at the public policy think-tank Institute of Policy Studies (IPS). Janadas Devan is married to literary scholar Geraldine Heng. His second son, Janamitra Devan, was the former Vice-President of the International Finance Corporation,http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/about+ifc/organization/about+ifc+-+mgmt+group+-+janamitra+devan and the World Bank. His third son, Janaprakash Devan died in Melbourne, Australia in 2010. His only daughter, Vijaya Kumari Devan continues to reside in Hamilton, Ontario.

Distribution and description This tree is native to the Indian subcontinent, ranging south of the Himalaya, from Myanmar in the east to Nepal, India and Bangladesh. In India, it extends from Assam, Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand west to the Shivalik Hills in Haryana, east of the Yamuna. The range also extends through the Eastern Ghats and to the eastern Vindhya and Satpura ranges of central India.Oudhia P., Ganguali R.N.

In Nepal, it is found mostly in the Terai region from east to west, especially, in the Sivalik Hills (Churia Range) in the subtropical climate zone. There are many protected areas, such as Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta National Park, where there are dense forests of huge sal trees. It is also found in the lower belt of the Hilly region and Inner Terai. The sal tree is known also as sakhua in northern India, including Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand.http://infochangeindia.org/environment/stories-of-change/a-rakhi- for-trees.htmlhttp://bjmirror0112.wordpress.com/ It is the state tree of two Indian states - Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.List of Indian state trees Sal is moderate to slow growing, and can attain heights of 30 to 35 m and a trunk diameter of up to 2-2.5 m. The leaves are 10‚Äì25 cm long and 5‚Äì15 cm broad. In wetter areas, Sal is evergreen; in drier areas, it is dry-season deciduous, shedding most of the leaves in between February to April, leafing out again in April and May. =Hinduism= In Hindu tradition, the sal tree is said to be favoured by Vishnu.Sacred trees Its name shala, shaal or sal, comes from Sanskrit (‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤, ≈õƒÅla, literally \\"house\\"), a name that suggests it for housing timber; other names in the Sanskrit language are ashvakarna, chiraparna and sarja, among many others. Jains state that the 24th tirthankara, Mahavira, achieved enlightenment under a sal. Some cultures in Bengal worship Sarna Burhi, a goddess associated with sacred groves of Sal trees. There is a standard decorative element of Hindu Indian sculpture which originated in a yakshi grasping the branch of a flowering tree while setting her foot against its roots.Buddhistische Bilderwelt: Hans Wolfgang Schumann, Ein ikonographisches Handbuch des Mahayana- und Tantrayana-Buddhismus. Eugen Diederichs Verlag.

Confusion with cannonball tree and other trees In Asia, the sal tree is often confused with the Couroupita guianensis or cannonball tree, a tree from tropical South America introduced to Asia by the British in the 19th century. The cannonball tree has since then been planted at Buddhist and Hindu religious sites in Asia in the belief that it is the tree of sacred scriptures. In Sri Lanka, Thailand and other Theravada Buddhist countries it has been planted at Buddhist monasteries and other religious sites. In India the cannonball tree has been planted at Shiva temples and is called Shiv Kamal or Nagalingam since its flowers are said to resemble the hood of a NƒÅga (divine cobra) protecting a Shiva lingam.L.B.Senaratne ‚ÄúThe revered 'Sal Tree' and the real Sal Tree‚Äù, Sunday Times, Sunday September 16, 2007, Accessed cessed on 15.1.2017 at http://www.sundaytimes.lk/070916/News/news00026.html An example of a cannonball tree erroneously named 'sal tree' is at the Pagoda at the Royal Palace of Phnom Penh in Cambodia.‚ÄúSal tree at Royal Palace Silver Pagoda‚Äù, accessed on 17.1.2017 at https://samilux.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/sal-tree-at-royal-palace-silver- pagoda/ In Japan the sal tree of Buddhist scriptures is identified as the deciduous camellia (Stewartia pseudocamellia), called shƒÅra, Ê≤ôÁæÖ, from Sanskrit ≈õƒÅla. The sal tree is also said to be confused with the Ashoka tree (Saraca indica).Weise, Kai. ‚ÄúManaging the Sacred Garden of Lumbini‚Äù, in Asian Heritage Management: Contexts, Concerns, and Prospects, Routledge, 2013, p. 122. Uses Sal is one of the most important sources of hardwood timber in India, with hard, coarse-grained wood that is light in colour when freshly cut, but becomes dark brown with exposure. The wood is resinous and durable, and is sought-after for construction, although not well suited to planing and polishing. The wood is especially suitable for constructing frames for doors and windows. The dry leaves of sal are a major source for the production of leaf plates called as patravali and leaf bowls in northern and eastern India, also used as leaf plates to serve food in Karnataka Canara (Dakshina Kannada, Gokarna) regions of India. The leaves are also used fresh to serve ready made paan (betelnut preparations) and small snacks such as boiled black grams, gol gappa, etc. The used leaves/plates are readily eaten by goats and cattle. The tree has therefore protected northern India from a flood of styrofoam and plastic plates that would have caused tremendous pollution. In Nepal, its leaves are used to make local plates and vessels called \\"tapari\\", \\"doona\\" and \\"bogata\\" in which rice and curry is served. However, the use of such \\"natural\\" tools have sharply declined during last decade. Sal tree resin is known as sal dammar or Indian dammar, ·πõla in Sanskrit. It is used as an astringent in Ayurvedic medicine,Sala, Asvakarna burned as incense in Hindu ceremonies, and used to caulk boats and ships. Sal seeds and fruit are a source of lamp oil and vegetable fat. The seed oil is extracted from the seeds and used as cooking oil after refining.

Taruc Freedom Park in San Luis, Pampanga in Barangay San Sebastian, beside Barangay Santa Cruz Poblacion along the Baliuag-Candaba-San Luis Provincial Road Luis Mangalus Taruc (June 21, 1913 - May 4, 2005) was a Filipino political figure and rebel during the agrarian unrest of the 1930s until the end of the Cold War. He was the leader of the Hukbalahap group (from Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon) between 1942 and 1950. His involvement with the movement came after his initiation to the problems of agrarian Filipinos when he was a student in the early 1930s. During World War II, Taruc led the Hukbalahap in guerrilla operations against the Japanese occupants of the Philippines. Influenced by his idol socialist Pedro Abad Santos of San Fernando, and inspired by earlier Katipunan revolutionaries such as Felipe Salvador, Taruc joined the Aguman ding Maldang Tala-pagobra (AMT, Kapampangan for 'Union of Peasant Workers') and in 1938, the Partido Socialista (Socialist Party). The latter merged with the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas as part of the Common Front strategy, and Taruc assumed the role of Commander-in-Chief of the military wing created to fight the Japanese. After the war against Japan, the Hukbalahap continued their demands for agrarian reform. Taruc and seven colleagues were elected to the House of Representatives, but the government of Manuel Roxas did not allow them to take their seats in Congress. The Taruc faction opposed the parity rights that the U.S. required from post- independence Philippines as a condition for rehabilitation funding. In the next five years, Taruc would give up on the parliamentary struggle and once more take up arms. At the height of its popularity, the Hukbalahap reached a fighting strength estimated at between 10,000 and 30,000. In 2017, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared Taruc a hero for being a \\"nationalist and defender of the rights of farmers and workers\\". Early life Luis Mangalus Taruc was born of peasant stock in the barrio of Santa Monica, township of San Luis, Pampanga on 21 June 1913. Luis states, \\"In my youth, the Christian faith dominated my spiritual life. But the landlord dominated the material life I knew.\\" At age eight, Luis attended the public school in San Miguel, Bulacan. At fifteen, he attended high school in Tarlac City. He attended to the University of Manila for two years (June 1932‚ÄìDecember 1934), studying medicine and law, but no longer able to afford the expenses, returned to Batasan without getting a degree to set up a tailor shop with his brother. As a teen he was inspired by the stories of the Katipuneros who had fought for independence and for agrarian reform against Spain. Certain people within his home village and province came to regard him as the incarnation of the prominent Katipunan leader Felipe Salvador.‚ÄúBorn Again of the People: Luis Taruc and Peasant Ideology in Philippine Revolutionary Politics,‚Äù Histoire Sociale / Social History. Vol. XLI, No. 82, Nov 2008, 417-458. He was influenced by Pedro Abad Santos, a Marxist, whom Luis regarded as a true socialist. In June 1935, he married Feliciana Bernabe, and his son Romeo was born in March 1936.Before the end of 1935, he joined Santos as a full-time organizer of the Socialist Party of the Philippines, which numbered a few hundred members and several thousand sympathizers. His wife died in Dec. 1938, suffering from goiter and anemia. He then married Enna Cura on 4 June 1939. Luis would serve time in prison three times before the war, in his struggle for the militant workers' and peasants' unions. Enna died of sepsis and diabetes on 8 March 1946. Luis later married Gregoria Calma (Liza). She was killed by government soldiers on 11 April 1952. World War II On 7 Nov. 1938, the Philippine Socialist Party and the Communist Party of the Philippines merged, forming a united front \\"to fight against fascism and war\\", though each party retained its own organizations until 1941. They pledged loyalty to the Philippine and United States government's anti-Japanese crusade in Dec. 1941. Following the Japanese invasion, Taruc formed the Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon or the \\"People‚Äôs Army Against the Japanese\\" in English), along with Casto Alejandrino and other guerillas, in central Luzon on 29 March 1942, became its commander-in-chief, and chairman of the Communist Party's Military Committee.Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, He led a large people's army against the Japanese invaders, and their \\"puppet constabulary\\", as Supremo Luis Taruc, or \\"Lu-Lu\\" (\\"the racing one\\"), then \\"Alipato\\" (\\"the flying spark that spreads a fire\\"). According to Luis, \\"There was a period when we had an American officer officially collaborating with our work.\\" Taruc credited his prominence through his \\"identification with the simple, sincere, and courageous peasants.\\" However, Luis noted, \\"...most of the time, the American authorities were suspicious of this unconventional army whose politics they suspected.\\" Yet, the Hukbalahap under Taruc did become an effective armed guerilla force. Post-war years Taruc was elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in 1946 as a member of the Democratic Alliance (the party led by Sergio Osmena). He and five other elected Democratic Alliance candidates opposed the constitutional amendment that would give American businessmen parity rights with Filipinos in exchange for US rehabilitation funding. In particular, Luis opposed the Bell Trade Act, the Parity Amendment to the Constitution, and the Military Bases Agreement. To secure the majority necessarily to pass the amendment President Manuel Roxas arranged for Taruc and the other oppositional Democratic Alliance members ejected from office by the Commission on Elections on the grounds that they had been committing election fraud and terrorism.Manuel L. Quezon III: The Daily Dose ¬ª Luis Taruc Taruc went underground in late 1946, following failed negotiations with President Roxas, and the Huks soon numbered 10,000 armed fighters. Subsequent negotiations with President Elpidio Quirino in June and August 1948 also failed. By the presidential elections of 1949, the Huks had abandoned electoral politics in favor of armed insurgency. The Huks controlled most of central Luzon, the ‚Äúrice basket‚Äù of the Philippines, including two provincial capitals, by 1950. Their motto, \\"a democratic peace, or martyrdom.\\" Luis states, \\"The peasants' hatred was founded on centuries of exploitation and oppression, feudal landlordism, and bad government. But the rich...were driven by fear of losing their power and their social privilege...this was naked class war.\\" In the Politburo meeting of Dec. 1949 to Jan. 1950, the Huks were reorganized as the HMB, \\"Hukbo Mapagpalaya ng Bayan\\", or \\"People's Army of Liberation\\", with Luis as a Politburo Supervisor (PBS) for the Party's Regional Committee, Reco 2, in the Zambales Mountains. By November 1950, Luis was removed from his post of command entirely. By then, the Huks had 15,000 armed men, and the country was embroiled in a \\"miniature civil war\\", with ambushes on the major highways common. President Quirino assigned Ramon Magsaysay, minister of national defense, to combat the Huk insurgency. On 18 Oct. 1950, Magsaysay captured the Secretariat, including the general secretary Jose Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila. Magsaysay attracted peasant support by reforming the Army and Constabulary. After the 1951 Central Committee meeting, a policy of \\"preservation and conservation of strength...for a long and bitter struggle\\" was adopted, and Luis departed with a group of ninety men and seven women, for the Sierra Madre Mountains. The latter part of 1952 was spent hiding in the Mount Arayat area. In January 1953, Luis was suspended from the Politburo and Secretariat for his \\"Call for Peace\\". On February 10, 1954, Manuel Manahan and Benigno Aquino, Jr., appointed as President Ramon Magsaysay's representatives, met with Luis Taruc. After four months of negotiations, Taruc surrendered unconditionally to the government on 17 May 1954,Farewell to a life-long advocate of social change: Luis Taruc, May 9, 2005, Manila Bulletin. effectively ending the Huk rebellion. On 15 June 1954, Luis met with President Magsaysay and Gen. Eulogio Balao at Camp Murphy, where Luis agreed to a trial. Taruc's trial started in Aug. 1954, where he pleaded guilty to rebellion, \\"in the spirit of my agreement with the president\\", and sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment, plus as \\"huge fine\\". From 1956 to 1958, Luis was put on trial for the execution of Feliciano Gardiner, Japanese occupation governor of Tarlac, for which he was found guilty and sentenced to four life sentences. His petition to President Diosdado Macapagal for executive clemency and amnesty to political prisoners in exchange for support for the President's social welfare program was ignored. Taruc was pardoned by President Ferdinand Marcos on September 11, 1968, and Marcos gained the former Huk leader's support. After his release, he continued to work for Agrarian reforms. His struggle on behalf of the poor farmers persuaded local and national leaders to strengthen the legal rights of farm workers and led to a more equitable distribution of farm land. In his later year's Taruc claimed to have never been a real communist, but rather always advocated Christian democratic socialism;Taruc, L., 1967, He Who Rides the Tiger, London: Geoffrey Chapman Ltd. he supported land reform strengthening the rights of local, small farmers over corporations and hereditary feudal elite.

Luis wrote, \\"I know now from experience, that the nationalism of the Communists is indeed opportunism, and that they use it for their own ends. Any nationalist who makes an ally of the Communist is going for a ride on a tiger.\\" Additionally, Luis wrote, \\"For ruthlessness and cruelty are alien to Christian thought, and when men in the Free World use such methods, they do so in defiance of their own morality and ideals. The atheist Communist, however, believes that the end justifies the means, or in Lenin's words, 'Morality is subordinate to the class struggle.' For this reason, the Communist can pursue a policy of terror and cruelty with a clear conscience.\\" In 1985, Taruc would tell F. Sionil Jose that one of the reasons for the failure of the insurgency was that dissenters were killed. He also said that dogmatic fundamentalism scared away many potential allies. The Huk movement commanded an estimated 170,000 armed troops with a base of two million civilian supporters at the apex of their power in 1952.Hukbalahap@Everything2.com In 2003 he explained to historian Keith Thor Carlson that he attributed the revolution's failure to the dogmatism of members of the politburo's Russian-trained elite, in particular Jose and Jesus Lava‚Äîan accusation that runs contrary to the views of the Lava's and William Pomeroy who counter that Taruc suffered from a cult of personality.Jesus Lava, Memoir of a Communist (Anvil Press, 2003) Several Huk veterans organizations dispute the credit heaped on Taruc for organizing the Hukbalahap during World War II. They contend that Taruc only joined the movement when several prominent Huk leaders were captured and executed by the Japanese, and that there were several Huk brigades operating in concert, under Castro Alejandrino, Eusebio Aquino and Mariano Franco among others. Death On May 4, 2005, Luis Taruc died of a heart attack in St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City at the age of 91, a month before his 92nd birthday. Many political figures went to Luis Taruc's wake to pay respect and give support to his family.

The Sahlqvist correspondence theorem states that every Sahlqvist formula is canonical, and corresponds to a first-order definable class of Kripke frames. Sahlqvist's definition characterizes a decidable set of modal formulas with first-order correspondents. Since it is undecidable, by Chagrova's theorem, whether an arbitrary modal formula has a first-order correspondent, there are formulas with first-order frame conditions that are not Sahlqvist [Chagrova 1991] (see the examples below). Hence Sahlqvist formulas define only a (decidable) subset of modal formulas with first-order correspondents.  Definition  Sahlqvist formulas are built up from implications, where the consequent is positive and the antecedent is of a restricted form. * A boxed atom is a propositional atom preceded by a number (possibly 0) of boxes, i.e. a formula of the form \\\\Box\\\\cdots\\\\Box p (often abbreviated as \\\\Box^i p for 0 \\\\leq i < \\\\omega). * A Sahlqvist antecedent is a formula constructed using ‚àß, ‚à®, and \\\\Diamond from boxed atoms, and negative formulas (including the constants ‚ä•, ‚ä§). * A Sahlqvist implication is a formula A ‚Üí B, where A is a Sahlqvist antecedent, and B is a positive formula. * A Sahlqvist formula is constructed from Sahlqvist implications using ‚àß and \\\\Box (unrestricted), and using ‚à® on formulas with no common variables.  Examples of Sahlqvist formulas  ; p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond p : Its first-order corresponding formula is \\\\forall x \\\\; Rxx, and it defines all reflexive frames ; p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Box\\\\Diamond p : Its first-order corresponding formula is \\\\forall x \\\\forall y [Rxy \\\\rightarrow Ryx], and it defines all symmetric frames ; \\\\Diamond \\\\Diamond p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond p or \\\\Box p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Box \\\\Box p : Its first-order corresponding formula is \\\\forall x \\\\forall y \\\\forall z [(Rxy \\\\land Ryz) \\\\rightarrow Rxz], and it defines all transitive frames ; \\\\Diamond p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond \\\\Diamond p or \\\\Box \\\\Box p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Box p : Its first- order corresponding formula is \\\\forall x \\\\forall y [Rxy \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists z (Rxz \\\\land Rzy)], and it defines all dense frames ; \\\\Box p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond p : Its first-order corresponding formula is \\\\forall x \\\\exists y \\\\; Rxy, and it defines all right-unbounded frames (also called serial) ; \\\\Diamond\\\\Box p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Box\\\\Diamond p : Its first-order corresponding formula is \\\\forall x \\\\forall x_1 \\\\forall z_0 [Rxx_1 \\\\land Rxz_0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists z_1 (Rx_1z_1 \\\\land Rz_0z_1)], and it is the Church-Rosser property. Examples of non-Sahlqvist formulas ; \\\\Box\\\\Diamond p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond \\\\Box p : This is the McKinsey formula; it does not have a first-order frame condition. ; \\\\Box(\\\\Box p \\\\rightarrow p) \\\\rightarrow \\\\Box p : The L√∂b axiom is not Sahlqvist; again, it does not have a first-order frame condition. ; (\\\\Box\\\\Diamond p \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond \\\\Box p) \\\\land (\\\\Diamond\\\\Diamond q \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond q) : The conjunction of the McKinsey formula and the (4) axiom has a first-order frame condition (the conjunction of the transitivity property with the property \\\\forall x[\\\\forall y(Rxy \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists z[Ryz]) \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists y(Rxy \\\\wedge \\\\forall z[Ryz \\\\rightarrow z = y])] ) but is not equivalent to any Sahlqvist formula.  Kracht's theorem  When a Sahlqvist formula is used as an axiom in a normal modal logic, the logic is guaranteed to be complete with respect to the elementary class of frames the axiom defines. This result comes from the Sahlqvist completeness theorem [Modal Logic, Blackburn et al., Theorem 4.42]. But there is also a converse theorem, namely a theorem that states which first-order conditions are the correspondents of Sahlqvist formulas. Kracht's theorem states that any Sahlqvist formula locally corresponds to a Kracht formula; and conversely, every Kracht formula is a local first-order correspondent of some Sahlqvist formula which can be effectively obtained from the Kracht formula [Modal Logic, Blackburn et al., Theorem 3.59].

Due to prior obligations resulting in temporary personnel changes following the band's formation in 1983, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the only studio album to feature all four founding members of the band on every track: vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. This is also the last album with Slovak before his death from a drug overdose in 1988, and the only full-length album to feature Irons. \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" was released as the album's only single, although \\"Me and My Friends\\" received minor radio airplay. In 1992, \\"Behind the Sun\\" was released as a single and music video to promote What Hits!?. The album features the band's signature funk rock musical style, but also is influenced by reggae and heavy metal. For the album, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recruited new producer Michael Beinhorn, who encouraged the members to expand their musical horizons in order to create a more diverse work. Bass player Flea later referred to the album as \\"the 'rockingest' record\\" the band has ever made.Uplift liner notes, 2003 Digital Remaster The album was much more successful than its predecessors, both critically and commercially, and was the band's first album to enter the Billboard 200, where it charted at number 148. Although Uplift's follow-up Mother's Milk would reach Gold first, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan would go on to become the band's earliest effort to do so. Following the tour to promote the album, Slovak died of a heroin overdose, and shortly thereafter, Irons decided to quit the band, unable to cope with his friend's death. Background After Red Hot Chili Peppers signed a record deal with EMI in 1983, founding members Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons left the group to focus on their group What Is This?, which had also signed a record deal. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea hired Jack Sherman as guitarist and Cliff Martinez as drummer, and established themselves as a prominent funk rock band with their 1984 debut album The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Disappointed with the results of the production, Kiedis and Flea replaced Sherman with Slovak, who had quit his band, What Is This?, several weeks earlier.(2002) \\"Behind the Music: Red Hot Chili Peppers episode\\". VH1. The group's George Clinton- produced second album, Freaky Styley (1985), was Slovak's first studio album with the band. In early 1986, the band began work on their upcoming album, and EMI gave the Chili Peppers a budget of $5,000 to record a demo tape. The band chose to work with producer and former Public Image Ltd. guitarist Keith Levene, because he shared the members' interest in drugs.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 187 Levene and Slovak put aside $2,000 of the budget to spend on drugs without telling the rest of the group, which created tension between the members. Martinez' \\"heart was no longer in the band\\", but he did not quit, so Kiedis and Flea fired him.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 188 After the firing of Martinez, original drummer Jack Irons rejoined the band, which marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983. Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record Uplift. Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal \\"literally asleep.\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 191 He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation. During that time, the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award, prompting Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey. He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 193 He checked into Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids, an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him. He moved in with his mother after 20 days at the clinic, a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was 11 years old.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004, p. 198 After Kiedis completed his stint in rehab, he felt a \\"whole new wave of enthusiasm\\" due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song entitled \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" on the flight home.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 200 He rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record the group's next album.Apter, p. 133 Recording While Kiedis was in rehab, the band sought a new producer for their next album. Aspiring producer Michael Beinhorn was looking for work at EMI Records after several unsuccessful projects on other labels, when a man working at EMI approached Beinhorn and suggested that he work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as \\"no one [knew] what to do with them\\".Mullen, 2010. p. 161 Beinhorn recalled of the situation, saying, \\"Though their music all seemed kind of abstract, there was definitely an excitement to it. I thought they needed a lot of arrangement help ... I also quickly learned that [executives] at the record label actually hated the Chili Peppers, like openly reviled them so bad that they didn't even want them to succeed. It was the weirdest thing.\\" He contacted the band to meet up, and instead of arranging a formal meeting, the band proposed to meet him at a club in New Orleans called Tipitina's. Beinhorn was impressed by the band's originality and its non-conformist attitude; as a result, he decided to work with the band. Kiedis then sat down with Beinhorn to discuss the album's recording; Kiedis planned to record the album in ten days and write the songs during the recording sessions.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 201 The album was recorded in the basement of the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 204 Although Kiedis had recently become clean, his withdrawal symptoms increased; therefore, this affected his musical contributions to the group. After fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis decided to take drugs again as a one-time attempt to celebrate his new music, which caused his resumed addiction. The recording process for the album became difficult, as Kiedis would often disappear to seek drugs.Apter, 2004. p. 184. Beinhorn recalled that \\"There were points in pre-production where I really thought the record wasn't gonna get made.\\"Mullen, 2010. p. 164 Kiedis felt \\"excruciating pain and guilt and shame\\" whenever he'd miss a recording session, so he tried writing lyrics and searching for drugs all at once; although the band was so upset about his drug use and frequent disappearances, they were impressed with his musical output at the time.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 205 Kiedis' drug use disrupted the early recording process, but the band still had such an enjoyable time recording the album. They were musically inspired by the rejoining of their original drummer Jack Irons, which added \\"such an important and different element to [their] chemistry.\\" Beinhorn encouraged the band to expand their musical horizons on the album; although the band were initially uncomfortable stepping out of their comfort zone, the members began thinking that Beinhorn was helping them produce their best work. Slovak helped Kiedis record his vocals on the album. In between takes, Slovak ran around the studio out of excitement and said, \\"This is the most beautiful thing we've ever done.\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 206 He reflected on his deep connection to the album in his diary, saying, \\"It was so fun. I'm so extremely proud of everybody's work--it is at times genius.\\"Slovak, 1999. p. 65 During a jam session, the guitarist created a melodic riff which differed greatly in style from the band's previous work. While Slovak nearly abandoned the riff out of fear that it was too much of a departure stylistically, Beinhorn saw potential in the new melody-based style and encouraged the guitar player to turn the short tune into a full song. While the band was skeptical at first, all members began writing their own musical parts, and the song became one of the album's three singles, \\"Behind the Sun\\". Music and lyrics { style=\\"font-size:100%\\" align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" color=\\"black\\" width=130px  } In the book Give It Away: The Stories Behind Every Song, author Rob Fitzpatrick writes \\"As far as sheer power goes, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the Chili Peppers at their most virile, most chest-beating, most unabashedly macho.\\"Fitzpatrick, p. 43 However, Kiedis recalls that during the composition of the album, Beinhorn encouraged him to step away from his improvisational speed-rap style in favor of slower, crooning vocals. At the time, Kiedis was very uncomfortable with his singing voice, and felt that the new style was \\"sappy\\". Kiedis also observed that guitarist Hillel Slovak's playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, and that Slovak had adopted a more fluid style featuring \\"sultry\\" elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 168 On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal. His melodic riff featured in the song \\"Behind the Sun\\" inspired the group to create \\"pretty\\" songs with an emphasis on melody. Kiedis describes the song as \\"pure Hillel inspiration\\".Slovak, 1999. p. 12 Slovak also used a talk box on the song \\"Funky Crime\\", in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 112 Flea incorporated a \\"slap\\" bass style on the album, which would become a staple of the band's early work.Apter, 2004. pp. 70‚Äì74 \\"Backwoods\\" features a \\"loose, swinging groove\\" and a \\"sky-scraping\\" guitar solo.Fitzpatrick, p. 44 \\"Skinny Sweaty Man\\" contains a rapid tempo and has been described as \\"hardcore garage psychedelic funkabilly\\", while \\"No Chump Love Sucker\\" displays punk rock and thrash influences.Fitzpatrick, p. 45 The album also features a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", which abandons nearly all of the original song's folk stylistics in favor of the band's signature funk-rock leanings. The songs \\"Skinny Sweaty Man\\" and \\"No Chump Love Sucker\\" were inspired by guitarist Hillel Slovak. The majority of the lyrics in the album focus on friendships between the band members, sex, and life in Los Angeles. The reunion of the four original members of the group had a great influence over the lyrics; Kiedis explained that \\"a lot of the jubilation in the lyrics of that record are about being united.\\" Kiedis was also inspired by personal experiences of himself and rest of the band members. During the recording of Freaky Styley, Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. When Slovak was under the influence, he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a \\"shuffling\\" fashion, which became the inspiration for the song \\"Skinny Sweaty Man\\" from Uplift.Slovak, 1999. p. 110 The song \\"No Chump Love Sucker\\" was also inspired by Slovak; during the recording of the album, Slovak had been \\"left high and dry\\" by a girlfriend who left him for someone who had \\"more money and more drugs\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 203‚Äì204 The song served as a revenge song against \\"that type of evil, materialistic woman.\\" \\"Funky Crime\\" was reflective of a conversation between the band and George Clinton while writing and recording Freaky Styley. Kiedis described the song as a lyrical description of the conversation, about how music itself is \\"color- blind\\" but is \\"segregated by the media and radio based on their perceptions of the artists.\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 203 Kiedis wrote \\"Me and My Friends\\", a song which \\"came together nicely\\", while driving home from San Francisco with his childhood friend Joe Walters. \\"Backwoods\\" details the history of rock and roll. Kiedis said that \\"Love Trilogy\\" became one of the group's all-time favorite songs; it is about \\"loving the things that aren't necessarily perfect or always lovable\\". He explained that \\"For years, whenever someone would question our lyrics, Flea would say, 'Read 'Love Trilogy' and you'll know what real lyrics are all about.'\\" Release and reception EMI originally refused to release the album unless the Chili Peppers changed the name of the song \\"Party on Your Pussy\\"; the band subsequently renamed the song \\"Special Secret Song Inside\\". The Uplift Mofo Party Plan was released on September 29, 1987 and peaked at number 148 on the Billboard 200, which was far more successful than any of the band's previous releases. It was the band's first album to enter the Billboard 200, and has since been certified Gold in the United States. The band filmed a music video for the album's lead single, \\"Fight Like a Brave\\", but the song failed to make an impact on any Billboard charts. \\"Behind the Sun\\" was not released as a single until 1992, after the band had released two subsequent albums, Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The single, which was released to promote the Chili Peppers' What Hits!? compilation album, peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The album also helped the Red Hot Chili Peppers earn a dedicated cult fanbase in Los Angeles. One of these fans was John Frusciante, who would later join the band as guitarist after Slovak's death. Frusciante recalled: \\"The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, and that was really amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show.\\"Mullen, 2010. p. 108 Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, \\"I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there.\\"Apter, 2004, p. 181. The album received mixed reviews from critics upon its release. Duncan Strauss of the Los Angeles Times described the album as \\"hit-and-miss\\"; while he praised the \\"tender tunefulness\\" of \\"Behind the Sun\\", he felt that the majority of the songs \\"wear pretty thin pretty fast, further suggesting that this is a band that's in command on stage‚Äîbut in trouble in the studio.\\" Bill Meredith of AllMusic observed that \\"the energy of having these four friends from Los Angeles back together jumps out of the opening anthem 'Fight Like a Brave' and the experimental 'Funky Crime' ... Slovak and Irons brought things to the Chili Peppers that no one else ever has.\\" Blaine Sayers of Consequence of Sound praised Slovak's guitar work on the album, saying that \\"Slovak proves with these tracks that he was not just a funk guitarist, but he could rock with the best thrash metal bands of the 80s as well.\\" In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Greg Kot was less impressed, writing that the album was a minor improvement over the band's last two efforts, but felt that the group's offbeat humor detracted from the album: \\"The California quartet brings a modicum of structure to The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, but their humor‚Äîas their famous 'party on your pussy' chorus demonstrates‚Äîwouldn't merit an audience in a high-school locker room.\\" Tour and Slovak's death The band embarked on an extensive international tour to promote the album. The Chili Peppers noted that during the tour, their fan base had rapidly increased both in size and enthusiasm. Kiedis recalled \\"During the Uplift tour I remember actually feeling a change taking place not just in the amount of people showing up at the gigs but the intensity of the fan base.\\" Flea added that \\"We were in love with those songs and how much fun we were having playing them.\\" Despite the band's new enthusiasm, Kiedis and Slovak continued to struggle with their worsening drug addictions. Both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using heroin prior to the tour and decided to help each other \\"steer clear\\" of the drug.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 208 During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal, with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis. His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show, leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 216 He recovered a few days later, but his bandmates felt he was not healthy enough to perform and replaced Slovak with DeWayne McKnight for a few shows.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 219 After a few days with McKnight, the band decided to give Slovak another chance, and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour. Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling, but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 221 Upon returning home, Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates, and struggled to resist the drug without the mutual support provided by his friends, Kiedis in particular. A few weeks after the band returned from the tour, the members attempted to get in contact with Slovak, but were unable to find him for several days. Slovak was found dead by police in his Hollywood apartment on June 27, 1988. During his autopsy, authorities determined that he had died on June 25, 1988 due to a heroin overdose. Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a group where his friends were dying. Kiedis and Flea debated whether they should continue making music, ultimately deciding to move ahead, hoping to continue what Slovak \\"helped build\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 224 The two recruited eighteen-year-old guitarist John Frusciante, who was a fan of the group and idolized Slovak. To replace Irons, the group held a lengthy open audition process, and eventually chose drummer Chad Smith.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 92nd Mayor of Philadelphia from 1962 to 1972. He was also a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and the Philadelphia City Council. He was the first Roman Catholic to serve as mayor of Philadelphia. Biography =Early life and career= He was born on April 10, 1910 in Philadelphia. He received his LL.B. from Temple University in 1938 and clerked for the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. He was active in Democratic Party politics and, in 1941, won a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to an at-large seat for Philadelphia County. He won re-election to the House in 1943 and 1945. In 1951, he won a seat on the Philadelphia City Council and became the President pro tempore in 1954, which became the council president in 1955. He held that position for nearly 10 years. =Mayor of Philadelphia= Mayor Richardson Dilworth resigned his post in 1962 in order to make a second run for Governor in that fall‚Äôs general election. As the city council president, Tate became acting mayor upon Dilworth‚Äôs resignation. He went on to win two terms in his own right, in 1963 and 1967. As a result, he is to date the longest serving mayor. In 1963, he defeated Republican James McDermott with 54% of the vote. He fended off a protest by the Congress of Racial Equality by stopping construction of the Philadelphia Municipal Services Building until more black workers were hired. In 1967, he appointed Frank Rizzo as the police commissioner. He defeated District Attorney Arlen Specter in 1967 by less than 12,000 votes. Towards the end of his life, Tate lived in Longport, New Jersey. Death Tate died of an apparent myocardial infarction in Somers Point, aged 73. References External links *Description of James H. J.

He shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 with George Beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in metabolism. The other half of that year's award went to Joshua Lederberg. Beadle and Tatum's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold Neurospora crassa to x-rays, causing mutations. In a series of experiments, they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. These experiments, published in 1941, led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the \\"one gene, one enzyme\\" hypothesis. Tatum went on to study genetics in bacteria. An active area of research in his laboratory was to understand the basis of Tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Later, Tatum and his student Joshua Lederberg showed that E. coli could share genetic information through recombination. Tatum was born in Boulder, Colorado. He attended the college at the University of Chicago for two years, and transferred to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he received his BA in 1931 and PhD in 1934. Starting in 1937, he worked at Stanford University, where he began his collaboration with Beadle. He then moved to Yale University in 1945 where he mentored Lederberg. He returned to Stanford in 1948 and then joined the faculty of Rockefeller Institute in 1957. A heavy cigarette smoker, he died in New York City of heart failure complicated by chronic emphysema.

Her keel was laid at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 23 July 1942. She was launched on 12 November 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Lewis Parks (wife of Lieutenant Commander Lew Parks), and commissioned on 20 April 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Frederic C. Lucas, Jr., in command. Between 12 August 1943 and 27 August 1945 Billfish made eight war patrols out of Pearl Harbor. During these patrols she sank three freighters totaling 4,074 tons and five smaller craft. Part of her seventh and eighth patrols were spent on plane guard duty off Japan. On 11 November 1943, in the Makassar Strait, a Japanese destroyer severely damaged Billfish with a depth charge attack, driving her to a depth of , some below her test depth while continuing the attack. Many of the crew were badly injured; Lieutenant Charles W. Rush found himself the senior man still able to carry out his duties. He assumed command and began attempting to escape the attack. Realizing that his boat's damaged fuel tanks were leaking profusely and the enemy was undoubtedly tracking him by the oil slick he was leaving, he reversed course so precisely that he was able to proceed back down his previous track, using the floating oil slick as cover instead of a trail. Meanwhile, Chief Electrician's Mate John D. Rendernick took action from his battle station and led emergency repairs, which included using a hydraulic jack to reposition the port main motor, which had been knocked off its foundation, and filling a leaking stern torpedo tube with grease. After 12 hours, the attack ceased. Four hours after that, under the cover of night, Rush surfaced the boat, recharged batteries using the single operating generator, completed repairs, and continued her patrol. For his actions, Rush earned the Navy Cross. Rendernick was awarded the Navy Silver Star, posthumously, and on 17 August 2004 the Naval Submarine Training Center (NAVSUBTRACEN) John D. Rendernick Damage Control Wet Trainer at Pearl Harbor was named in his honor. Billfish arrived at Pearl Harbor from her last war patrol on 27 August 1945, and was ordered to the Atlantic. She arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 19 September and spent the next nine months in maneuvers and training. Following inactivation at Portsmouth Navy Yard (June - October 1946) she was towed to New London, Connecticut, by ATR-64 and went out of commission in reserve there 1 November 1946. Billfish received seven battle stars for her World War II service. The Billfish, like several other World War II boats, did not end her service at the end of the war. From 1 January 1960 until 1 April 1968 she served as a training vessel for the Naval Reserve, First Naval District, at the South Boston Annex of the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was stricken from the list of Navy ships on 1 April 1968 and subsequently sold for scrapping in 1971. References * External links * Interview with Capt.

Taube completed his undergraduate and Masters degrees at the University of Saskatchewan, and his Ph.D from the University of California, Berkeley. After finishing graduate school, Taube worked at Cornell University, the University of Chicago and Stanford University. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Taube also received many other major scientific awards, including the Priestley Medal in 1985 and two Guggenheim Fellowships early in his career (1949 and 1955), as well as numerous honorary doctorates. His research focused on redox reactions, transition metals and the use of isotopically labeled compounds to follow reactions. He had over 600 publications including one book, and had mentored over 200 students during his career. Taube and his wife Mary had three children; his son Karl is an anthropologist at the University of California Riverside. Education At 12, Taube left his hometown and moved to Regina to attend Luther College where he completed high school. After graduating, Taube stayed at Luther College and worked as laboratory assistant for Paul Liefeld, allowing him to take first year university classes. Taube attended the University of Saskatchewan, receiving his B.Sc. in 1935 and his M.Sc in 1937. His thesis advisor at the University of Saskatchewan was John Spinks. While at the University of Saskatchewan, Taube studied with Gerhard Herzberg, who would be awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He moved to University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his Ph.D studies in 1940. His Ph.D mentor was William Bray. Taube's graduate research focused on the photodecomposition of chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide in solution. Research and academic career =Academic posts= After completing his education, Taube remained in the United States, becoming an instructor in chemistry at Berkeley until 1941. He initially wanted to return to Canada to work, but did not receive a response when he applied for jobs at the major Canadian universities. From Berkeley, he served as an instructor and assistant professor at Cornell University until 1946. During World War II, Taube served on the National Defense Research Committee. Taube spent time at the University of Chicago as an assistant professor, associate professor and as a full professor from 1946‚Äì61. He served as chair of the chemistry department in Chicago from 1956‚Äì59, but did not enjoy administrative work. After leaving Chicago, Taube worked as a professor at Stanford University until 1986, a position that allowed him to focus on research, while also teaching classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels. He became a Professor Emeritus at Stanford in 1986, but he continued to perform research until 2001, and visited his labs every day until his death in 2005. In addition to his academic duties, Taube also served as a consultant at Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1956 until the 1970s. =Research interests= Taube's initial research at Cornell University focused on the same areas he studied as a graduate student, oxidizing agents containing oxygen and halogens, and redox reactions featuring these species. He used isotopically labeled oxygen-18 and radioactive chlorine to study these reactions. He was recognized by the American Chemical Society in 1955 for his isotope studies. Taube's interest in coordination chemistry was sparked when he was chosen to develop a course on advanced inorganic chemistry while at the University of Chicago. He was unable to find much information in the textbooks available at the time. Taube realized that his work on the substitution of carbon in organic reactions could be related to inorganic complexes. In 1952, Taube published a key paper relating the rates of chemical reactions to electronic structure in Chemical Reviews. This research was the first to recognize the correlation between the rate of ligand substitution and the d-electron configuration of the metal. Taube's key discovery was the way molecules build a type of \\"chemical bridge\\" rather than simply exchanging electrons, as previously thought. Identifying this intermediate step explained why reactions between similar metals and ions occurred at different rates. His paper in Chemical Reviews was developed while on sabbatical in the late 1940s. An article in Science called this paper \\"one of the true classics in inorganic chemistry\\" after his Nobel Prize was announced. Taube researched ruthenium and osmium, both elements have a high capacity for back bonding. This type of electron donation was key when studying the way electrons are transferred between molecules in a chemical reaction. When looking back on his research, Taube explained that he sometimes had difficulty finding graduate students willing to work on electron transfer reactions, as they preferred to work on more \\"exciting\\" projects in his laboratory focusing on the effects of isotopic tracers and kinetics. Taube felt that a \\"primary flaw\\" with his correlation between electron configuration and ligand substitution was that it was described mainly in terms of valence bond theory, as crystal field theory and ligand field theory were not well established when he published his work in 1952. =Awards and honors= Nobel Prize Taube was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his work on the mechanisms of electron transfer reactions, especially in metal complexes.\\" He received his award on December 8, 1983, with the presentation speech being delivered by Ingvar Lindqvist of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences. Taube's Nobel Lecture was entitled \\"Electron Transfer between Metal Complexes - Retrospective.\\" His Nobel Prize was the second awarded to a Canadian-born chemist (the first one was William Giauque). His initial paper in Chemical Reviews was 30 years old at the time of his Nobel Prize victory, but the correlation he described between the rate of ligand substitution and electronic configuration for transition metal coordination complexes was still the predominant theory about the reaction chemistry of these compounds. After being awarded the Nobel Prize, Taube noticed a side benefit to the prestigious award - his students paid better attention in class. Other awards Taube was accepted as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1959. President Jimmy Carter presented Taube with the 1976 President's National Medal of Science \\"in recognition of contributions to the understanding of reactivity and reaction mechanisms in inorganic chemistry.\\" In 1985, Taube received the American Chemical Society's highest honor, the Priestley Medal, which is awarded to recognize \\"distinguished services to chemistry\\". He was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships in 1949 and 1955. In 1965, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Taube was made an honorary member of the College of Chemists of Catalonia and Beleares (1984), the Canadian Society of Chemists (1986), and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1988). He was also awarded an honorary fellowship in the Royal Society of Chemistry (1989) and the Indian Chemical Society (1989) and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1988. Taube received honorary degrees from many institutions, including the University of Saskatchewan (1973), the University of Chicago (1983), the Polytechnic Institute of New York (1984), the State University of New York Stony Brook (1985), the University of Guelph (1987), Seton Hall University (1988), the Lajos Kossuth University of Debrecen in Hungary (1988) and Northwestern University (1990). A Nobel Laureate Plaza on the University of Saskatchewan's campus in honour of Taube and Gerhard Herzberg was dedicated in 1997. Legacy In 1981, Taube became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. As of 1997, Taube had over 600 publications, and had worked with over 250 students. He published a book, Electron Transfer Reactions of Complex Ions in Solution (Current Chemical Concepts) in 1970. His students have had faculty positions at many prestigious universities, including Cornell, Rutgers, Georgetown and Georgia Tech. Together with graduate student Carol Creutz, he is the namesake of the Creutz- Taube complex, a metal complex with the formula [Ru(NH3)5]2(C4H4N2)5+. His research contributions have been honored in several ways, including a symposium at the 1982 annual American Chemical Society meeting. The annual series Progress in Inorganic Chemistry dedicated its 30th volume to Taube, entitled \\"An Appreciation of Henry Taube.\\" Luther College in Regina, Saskatchewan offers an annual scholarship to an entering science student in honour of Taube and his science teacher, Paul Liefeld. A seminar series was created in honor of his work at Stanford. Taube gave the inaugural lecture in the series. Colleagues remember Taube as a dedicated scientist, Jim Collman of Stanford said \\"Henry was a scientist's scientist and a dominant figure in the field of inorganic chemistry.\\" Harry Gray, a professor at California Institute of Technology said, \\"He was in a class by himself, a role model and leader whom we all admired and loved.\\" Former student Peter Ford remembers that Taube \\"made chemistry not only challenging and stimulating, but a lot of fun as well.\\" Personal life Taube was born November 30, 1915 in Neudorf, Saskatchewan as the youngest of four boys. His parents were German ethnics from Ukraine which had immigrated to Saskatchewan from Ukraine in 1911. Growing up, his first language was Low German. In the 1700s, Catherine the Great encouraged Central European farmers to settle in Russia. As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants. Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting: \\"Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken in the context of those times that I would wish to be changed. The advantages that I enjoyed include: the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which taught me an appreciation of nature, and taught me also to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done...\\" After completing his graduate studies, Taube became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1942. Taube married his wife, Mary in 1952. They had three children, Karl, Heinrich and Linda. His stepdaughter, Marianna died of cancer in 1998. When he stopped his active research projects in 2001, Taube continued to be available as a reviewer and consultant, but his main goal was \\"enjoying life\\". Away from chemistry, Taube had varied interests including gardening and classical music, mainly opera. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Henry Taube died in his home in Palo Alto, California on November 16, 2005, at the age of 89. References Publications *Taube, H., Jackson, J. A. & J. F.

It was written and directed by Sally Potter, who also co-wrote the music for the film (with David Motion). Potter chose to film much of the Constantinople portion of the book in the isolated city of Khiva in Uzbekistan, and made use of the forest of carved columns in the city's 18th century Djuma Mosque. Critics praised the film, and particularly applauded its visual treatment of the settings of Woolf's novel. The film premiered in competition at the 49th Venice International Film Festival, and was re-released in select US cinemas in August 2010. Plot The story begins in the Elizabethan era, shortly before the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603. On her deathbed, the Queen promises an androgynous young nobleman named Orlando a large tract of land and a castle built on it, along with a generous monetary gift; both Orlando and his heirs would keep the land and inheritance forever, but Elizabeth will bequeath it to him only if he assents to an unusual command: \\"Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.\\" Orlando acquiesces and reposes in splendid isolation in the castle for a couple of centuries, during which time he dabbles in poetry and art. His attempts to befriend a celebrated poet, however, backfire when the poet ridicules his verse. Orlando then travels to Constantinople as English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, and is almost killed in a diplomatic fracas. Waking up seven days later, he learns something startling: he has transformed into a woman. The now Lady Orlando comes home to her estate in Middle-Eastern attire, only to learn that she faces several impending lawsuits arguing that Orlando was a woman all along and therefore has no right to the land or any of the royal inheritance that the Queen had promised. The succeeding two centuries tire Orlando out; the court case, bad luck in love, and the wars of British history eventually bring the story to the present day (i.e., the early 1990s). Orlando now has a young daughter in tow and is in search of a publisher for her book. (The literary editor who judges the work as \\"quite good\\" is portrayed by Heathcote Williams‚Äîthe same actor who played the poet who had, earlier in the film, denigrated Orlando's poetry.) Having lived a most bizarre existence, Orlando, relaxing with her daughter and daydreaming philosophically under a tree, has finally found a tranquil niche. = Differences from the novel = Director Sally Potter described her approach to the adaptation as follows: > My task [‚Ä¶] was to find a way of remaining true to the spirit of the book > and to Virginia Woolf's intentions, whilst being ruthless with changing the > book in any way necessary to make it work cinematically‚Ä¶ The most immediate > changes were structural. The storyline was simplified [and] any events which > did not significantly further Orlando's story were dropped. The film contains some anachronisms not present in the novel. For example, upon Orlando's arrival in Constantinople in about the year 1700, England is referred to as a \\"green and pleasant land\\", a line from William Blake's Jerusalem, which in reality was not written until 1804. Also, Orlando receives a gift to celebrate the new century from Queen Anne, who had in fact not yet succeeded to the throne. Potter argued that \\"whereas the novel could withstand abstraction and arbitrariness (such as Orlando's change of sex), cinema is more pragmatic.\\" She continued, > There had to be reasons‚Äîhowever flimsy‚Äîto propel us along a journey based > itself on a kind of suspension of disbelief. Thus, Queen Elizabeth bestows > Orlando's long life upon him, [‚Ä¶] whereas in the book it remains > unexplained. And Orlando's change of sex in the film is the result of his > having reached a crisis point‚Äîa crisis of masculine identity. At film's end, Orlando has a daughter, whereas in the novel she had a son. Potter has said that she intended Orlando's breaking the fourth wall to be an equivalent to Woolf's direct addresses to her readers, and that this was her attempt at converting Woolf's literary wit into a more 'cinematic' humour. One obvious similarity remained, however: the film ends in its present day, 1992, just as Woolf's novel ends in its present day, 1928.

Reception Prior to Orlando's release in the United States in June 1993, Vincent Canby wrote in an effusively positive review, > This ravishing and witty spectacle invades the mind through eyes that are > dazzled without ever being anesthetised. Throughout Ms. Potter's Orlando, as > in Woolf's, there [is] a piercing kind of common sense and a joy that, > because they are so rare these days in any medium, create their own kind of > cinematic suspense and delightedly surprised laughter. Orlando could well > become a classic of a very special kind‚Äînot mainstream perhaps‚Äîbut a model > for independent film makers who follow their own irrational muses, sometimes > to unmourned obscurity, occasionally to glory. Canby, however, cautioned that while the novel stands on its own, he was not sure if the film does. He wrote, \\"Potter's achievement is in translating to film something of the breadth of Woolf's remarkable range of interests, not only in language and literature, but also in history, nature, weather, animals, the relation of the sexes and the very nature of the sexes.\\" By contrast, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described Orlando as \\"hollow‚Ä¶ smug‚Ä¶ and self-satisfied\\" and complained that \\"any kind of emotional connection to match [Orlando's] carefully constructed look‚Ä¶ is simply not to be had.\\"Kenneth Turan, \\"Lush 'Orlando' Makes Its Point Once Too Often\\", Los Angeles Times, 25 June 1993, p. F8. By 2010, Orlando was received as part of Potter's successful oeuvre with Matthew Connelly and had one critic affirming in the very first line of his review that \\"Rarely have source material, director, and leading actress been more in alignment than in Orlando, the 1992 adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel, directed by Sally Potter and starring Tilda Swinton [. . .]. Watching Orlando some 17 years after its U. S. theatrical run, however, proves a welcome reminder of just how skillfully they [Potter and Swinton] marshalled their respective gifts here, how openly they entered into a dialogue with Woolf's playful, slippery text.\\" Rotten Tomatoes scored the film positively at 84% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 6.72/10. Awards Orlando was nominated for Academy Awards for art direction (Ben Van Os, Jan Roelfs) and costume design (Sandy Powell), but lost to Schindler's List and The Age of Innocence, respectively. The film was also nominated for the 1994 Independent Spirit Awards' Best Foreign Film award. At the 29th Guldbagge Awards, the film was nominated for the Best Foreign Film award. Orlando: The Queer Element Poster advertising Orlando: The Queer Element at Hanbury Hall In 2017, the film was screened multiple times as part of a multi-media arts project Orlando: The Queer Element. The project explored issues of science and gender through history and was organised by the theatre company Clay & Diamonds, in association with organisations such as the BFI and the National Trust, with funding from the Wellcome Trust and Arts Council England. A one-off immersive performance using five actors‚Äîsome from the LGBT community‚Äîtook place on Friday 24 March at the BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival, alongside a 25th Anniversary screening of the film. A separate series of performances was mounted in June by Clay & Diamonds with over thirty actors from the performance training company Fourth Monkey. Together they created a site-specific piece that was performed at the National Trust venues Hanbury HallArchive page of Orlando: The Queer Element at Hanbury Hall on The National Trust's website and Knole house (the home of Vita Sackville-West, Woolf‚Äôs lover, and the inspiration for Orlando). These performances were made for both the public and school audiences, with many of the performances featuring a screening of the film. The event also served part of the National Trust's \\"Prejudice and Pride\\" programme, which marked 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom with the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. The project also featured the screening of a number of short art films created by Masters in Design students at the Royal College of Art, as well as a series of scientific workshops and lectures. 2020 Met Gala inspiration Orlando, both the film and the novel, was the main inspiration for both the 2020 spring exhibition of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the 2020 Met Gala. The exhibition, entitled \\"About Time: Fashion and Duration\\", was specifically inspired by the \\"labyrinth\\" scene in Orlando, where Tilda Swinton runs through the labyrinth dressed in an 18th century gown before she reappears dressed in mid-19th century garb. Using that scene as the initial inspiration, curator Andrew Bolton took \\"Orlando‚Äôs concept of time and the manner in which she/he moves seamlessly through the centuries\\" to \\"trace more than a century and a half of fashion, illustrating how garments of the past influence the present.\\" Although the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the Met Gala, the opening of the exhibition itself was postponed until October 2020.

Early life Wages and Capital, 1935 He was born on December 28, 1859, in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of William Taussig and Adele Wuerpel. His parents encouraged his literary and musical interests, and he played the violin at an early age. He was educated in the St. Louis public schools and at Smith Academy in that same city. He then went to Washington University there but, after a year transferred to Harvard from where he graduated in 1879. He traveled in Europe for a year, taking some time to study economics at the University of Berlin. He then did graduate work at Harvard in law and economics while he was secretary to President Charles W. Eliot for some years. Teaching He got a law degree in 1886 and was appointed assistant professor at Harvard. He became professor of economics in 1892, and he remained at Harvard for the balance of his professional career except for several years spent in federal service and some time spent traveling in Europe recovering from a nervous disorder. Beliefs Taussig was an open advocate of forced sterilization of races and classes he considered inferior. In his 1911 textbook Principles of Economics, Taussing remarked: Paul Douglas (a future president of the American Economic Association and three-term Senator from Illinois) was a graduate student under Taussig at Harvard in the Fall of 1915 and recalled the experience. Douglas had studied two years in graduate school at Columbia University with Edwin Seligman, who was an ideological enemy of Taussig. Given the opportunity to criticize the Columbia school of economic thought by confronting Douglas, Taussig attempted to humiliate him to the delight of the Harvard pupils who filled the lecture hall to witness the \\"slaughter\\". Eventually, Douglas turned the tables and trapped Taussig in a logical economic debate. Douglas recalled, \\"The following day, Taussig cordially shook hands with me at the end of the hour. ... We also became fast friends for the rest of his life. Trying as the experience was, it was the best thing to happen to me in my academic life. It forced me to master the reasoning of the great economic theorists and to stand my ground under verbal and logical bombardment.\\" Beet sugar and tariff In a 1912 article in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Taussig favored protecting the beet sugar industry with a tariff on sugar imports. A beet sugar industry gives intangible benefits by adding to the versatility and capabilities of American agriculture. Unskilled labor gains employment in the labor-intensive beet sugar sector of agriculture. Beet sugar grows best in cool climates of the irrigated regions of Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and California. Other positions held He was the editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics from 1889 to 1890 and from 1896 to 1935, president of the American Economic Association in 1904 and 1905, and chair of the United States Tariff Commission from 1917 to 1919. In March 1919, he was called to Paris to advise in the adjustment of commercial treaties, and in November, on invitation of Woodrow Wilson, he attended the second industrial conference in Washington, DC, for promoting peace between capital and labour. He was a strong supporter of the League of Nations. Death He died on November 11, 1940, aged 80, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Taussig is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. Legacy The successor to his chair at Harvard was Joseph Schumpeter. In 1888, he married Edith Thomas Guild. One of their four children was Helen B. Taussig (1898‚Äì1986), a noted pediatrician and cardiologist. F. W. Taussig's first wife died in 1910, and he married Laura Fisher.

Freaky Styley marks founding guitarist Hillel Slovak's studio album debut, following his return to the band earlier in the year. The album is the last to feature drummer Cliff Martinez. Freaky Styley was produced by George Clinton, of Parliament-Funkadelic, and the sessions benefitted from Clinton's chemistry with the band but suffered from the band's drug use during recording. The music on the record draws influence from funk, punk rock, and psychedelic rock, while the lyrical content was inspired by the band members' lives in Hollywood. \\"Jungle Man\\" and \\"Hollywood (Africa)\\" were released as promotional singles while \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" and \\"Jungle Man\\" had music videos made for them. Critics viewed the album as an improvement upon the band's debut album, praising Freaky Styley's musical experimentation and production. However, it did not achieve mainstream success and failed to enter the Billboard 200. The band embarked on the Infinity Tour to promote the album. Background Red Hot Chili Peppers was formed by Anthony Kiedis, Hillel Slovak, Flea, and Jack Irons while they attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. Originally named Tony Flow & the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, the group was originally meant as a one-off band for playing only one show. However, after a positive crowd reception, the band changed its name to Red Hot Chili Peppers. The group was noticed by EMI, and the band signed with the record label. Slovak and Irons still considered the Peppers a side project, so they quit to focus on their band What Is This?; that group had signed a record contract two weeks earlier. Kiedis and Flea subsequently recruited guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez to complete the band's lineup for its debut album. The band ended disappointed in the first album's overall sound, thinking it was overly polished, as if it had \\"gone through a sterilizing Goody Two-shoes machine\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 145 During the tour in support of the band's first album, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers after growing tired of What is This?. Because the Peppers did not have a positive experience working with Andy Gill on their previous record, they began searching for a new producer for their next album.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 169 The first potential producer the band worked with was Malcolm McLaren, who had worked with the Sex Pistols and Bow Wow Wow. However, McLaren suggested they changed their style to play more simplified, 1950s-style rock and roll and make Kiedis the central character, a change the group vehemently opposed. After receiving comparisons from fans to Parliament-Funkadelic, the band indicated to EMI Records its desire to work with frontman George Clinton. The band contacted Clinton and sent him their debut album and demo tapes, and Flea and the band's manager, Lindy, traveled to Detroit to meet him. Clinton agreed to work with the band, and EMI paid him $25,000 to produce the album.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 170 The song \\"Blackeyed Blonde\\" was performed by the band in the 1985 skateboarding movie Thrashin' starring Josh Brolin. Recording The band felt a strong chemistry with producer George Clinton (pictured in 2007). The band had already written approximately 70 percent of the album (mostly with Sherman, not Slovak) by the time the group traveled to Michigan to record the album. Clinton decided that the band would spend a month with him before recording to bond and create ideas for new songs. Before renting a house of their own, the group members stayed in Clinton's house in the village of Brooklyn, about an hour away from Detroit, for a week.Kiedis, Sloman, pp. 170‚Äì171 The band was excited to live with Clinton, but as soon as Kiedis moved in, he began experiencing severe heroin withdrawal, and became very ill. He attempted to offset his desire for heroin by using cocaine instead, but his relief was short-lived.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 171 After a few days, however, his symptoms subsided and he was able to join the group in playing music and connecting with Clinton. The Red Hot Chili Peppers felt a strong chemistry with Clinton and enjoyed his quirky personality and storytelling abilities. After a week of living with him, the band moved into a house on a nearby golf course.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 172 Freaky Styley was recorded at United Sound Studios in Detroit. Martinez recalled that \\"George had a party atmosphere in the studio all the time, but a productive party atmosphere. You took care of business, but he made sure you had a lot of fun doing it.\\"Mullen, 2010. p. 157 The band and Clinton began using copious amounts of cocaine together, which had a negative effect on the band's overall health. When the time came for Kiedis to record his vocals, he decided to abstain from cocaine use for two weeks, an experience he likened to \\"deciding to be celibate when you're living in a brothel.\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 175 The track \\"Yertle the Turtle\\" incorporates several verses directly from Dr. Seuss' poem also named \\"Yertle the Turtle.\\" As stated by Kiedis in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, the spoken lyrics at the beginning saying \\"Look at that turtle go bro.\\" and throughout the song were by George Clinton's drug dealer who demanded debts be paid by Clinton. Unable to repay the dealer, Clinton offered him a part in the album.Kiedis, Sloman, pp. 174‚Äì175 Composition According to Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic, Freaky Styley is \\"the closest the Red Hot Chili Peppers ever came to straight funk.\\" The album marks the return of guitarist Hillel Slovak, and Kiedis observed that Slovak's playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, with the guitarist adopting a more fluid style featuring \\"sultry\\" elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques.Kiedis, Sloman, p. 168 The band also experimented with a more diverse variety of musical genres on Freaky Styley. \\"Jungle Man\\" contains psychedelic rock-styled guitar, layered background vocals, and an \\"urgent, aggressive dance beat\\". \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" draws influence from punk rock music, while \\"Blackeyed Blonde\\" has been described as \\"Aerosmith meets Isaac Hayes\\". The album features covers of \\"If You Want Me to Stay\\" by Sly and the Family Stone, and \\"Africa\\" by The Meters. Clinton helped with the vocal arrangements and provided his own vocals for a portion of \\"Hollywood (Africa)\\". \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" was inspired by a sexual encounter Kiedis had with a fourteen-year-old Catholic school student in New Orleans while on tour in 1984.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 159 \\"Jungle Man\\" was dedicated to Flea, whom Kiedis used to create a fictionalized persona of \\"this half-man, half-beast born in the belly of the volcano in Australia coming to the world and using his thumb as the conductor of thunder on the bass.\\" The lyrics of the band's cover of \\"Africa\\" by The Meters differ slightly from the original, intended to reflect the group's hometown of Hollywood. At the time, Flea listened repeatedly to the Meters and wanted to cover one of the group's songs, and Clinton suggested that the group use the opportunity to dedicate a song to Hollywood, saying, \\"What if you did the song 'Africa' but had Anthony do a rewrite so it's no longer 'Africa', but it's your 'Africa', which is Hollywood?\\"Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 173 Artwork The cover artwork features the band jumping in front of Michelangelo's 'The Last Judgment'. Critical reception Freaky Styley did not garner mainstream success and failed to enter the Billboard 200. In the liner notes to the 2003 remastered edition of the album, bassist Flea states:Liner notes to Freaky Styley remaster (2003) However, the album was more positively received by critics than the band's debut album. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic felt that Clinton's production helped to make Freaky Styley an improvement over The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and enjoyed Slovak's return, noting that the guitarist \\"makes a major contribution to practically every song\\". He further wrote that \\"the Peppers have a good clutch of songs to work with in addition to excellent production. And too, they seem relaxed and at ease here, playing quirky songs without any self-consciousness, a quality lacking on their debut.\\" Ira Robbins of Rolling Stone called the album \\"wilder, rougher, funnier and funkier\\" than The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and opined that \\"the Chili Peppers are taking advantage of the current crossover free-for-all to universalize funk by expanding its limits and incorporating new ingredients without diluting the basic bump. Fed up with the empty calories of effete high-tech dance records? Freaky Styley is stick- to-the-ribs rock that puts meat back in the motion.\\" Greg Kot was more critical in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), believing that like the group's debut album, Freaky Styley had \\"not a single memorable song\\" while the band's \\"funk-monkey shtick camouflaged serious musical deficiencies\\". Tour and Jack Irons returns The tour for Freaky Styley known as the Infinity Tour began in 1985. Both Kiedis and Slovak were beginning their long (and in Slovak's case soon to be fatal) battles with drugs on this tour. The band decided to begin recording their third album in the spring of 1986 but by this time drummer Cliff Martinez decided he just didn't have the heart to continue, though rather than quitting, Kiedis and Flea fired Martinez. To the band's amazement, founding drummer, Jack Irons decided to return and for the first time since 1983 the original lineup was together. Together, the reunited lineup finished the remainder of the Freaky Styley tour. Following the end of the tour, Kiedis' drug problems were so bad that he was briefly fired from the band.

History Zwaag was founded in the 13th century. The church tower is dated to around 1500. Originally, the population consisted of sailors and artisans. Zwaag was a town then, but it lost its city rights after prolonged disputes with nearby Hoorn. As of the 15th century, Zwaag was village of berry growers and dairy farmers. From 1900 onwards, more and more greenhouse were built for growing flowers. In 1979 it became part of Hoorn in 1979 in order for Hoorn to expand and take up surplus population of Amsterdam. Most of the land that belonged to Zwaag is now urbanized and on places where no houses are built, industrial zones have sprung up.

His father was a wealthy farmer. Bayard received his early instruction in an academy at West Chester, Pennsylvania, and later at nearby Unionville. At the age of seventeen, he was apprenticed to a printer in West Chester. This cites Smyth (1896) and Howells (1901). The influential critic and editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold encouraged him to write poetry. The volume that resulted, Ximena, or the Battle of the Sierra Morena, and other Poems, was published in 1844 and dedicated to Griswold.Bayless, Joy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943. p. 128 Using the money from his poetry and an advance for travel articles, he visited parts of England, France, Germany and Italy, making largely pedestrian tours for almost two years. He sent accounts of his travels to the Tribune, The Saturday Evening Post, and Gazette of the United States. In 1846, a collection of his articles was published in two volumes as Views Afoot, or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff. That publication resulted in an invitation to serve as an editorial assistant for Graham's Magazine for a few months in 1848.Oberholtzer, Ellis Paxson. The Literary History of Philadelphia. Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs & Co., 1906: 273. . That same year, Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, hired Taylor and sent him to California to report on the gold rush. He returned by way of Mexico and published another two-volume collection of travel essays, El Dorado; or, Adventures in the Path of Empire (1850). Within two weeks of release, the books sold 10,000 copies in the U.S. and 30,000 in Great Britain. Illustration of San Francisco in November 1849, from publication El Dorado.

He also traveled in Palestine and Mediterranean countries, writing poetry based on his experiences. Toward the end of 1852, he sailed from England to Calcutta, and then to China, where he joined the expedition of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry to Japan. The results of these journeys were published as A Journey to Central Africa; or, Life and Landscapes from Egypt to the Negro Kingdoms of the White Nile (1854); The Lands of the Saracen; or, Pictures of Palestine, Asia Minor, Sicily and Spain (1854); and A Visit to India, China and Japan in the Year 1853 (1855). He returned to the U.S. on December 20, 1853, and undertook a successful public lecturer tour that extended from Maine to Wisconsin. After two years, he went to northern Europe to study Swedish life, language and literature. The trip inspired his long narrative poem Lars. His series of articles Swedish Letters to the Tribune were republished as Northern Travel: Summer and Winter Pictures (1857). In Berlin in 1856, Taylor met the great German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, hoping to interview him for the New York Tribune. Humboldt was welcoming, and inquired whether they should speak English or German. Taylor planned to go to central Asia, where Humboldt had traveled in 1829. Taylor informed Humboldt of Washington Irving's death; Humboldt had met him in Paris. Taylor saw Humboldt again in 1857 at Potsdam.Helmut de Terra, Alexander von Humboldt. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1955, pp.363-65. In October 1857, he married Maria Hansen, the daughter of the Danish/German astronomer Peter Hansen. The couple spent the following winter in Greece. In 1859 Taylor returned to the American West and lectured at San Francisco. In 1862, he was appointed to the U.S. diplomatic service as secretary of legation at St. Petersburg, and acting minister to Russia for a time during 1862-3 after the resignation of Ambassador Simon Cameron. Cedarcroft, Taylor's home. He published his first novel Hannah Thurston in 1863. The newspaper The New York Times first praised him for \\"break[ing] new ground with such assured success\\". A second much longer appreciation in the same newspaper was thoroughly negative, describing \\"one pointless, aimless situation leading to another of the same stamp, and so on in maddening succession\\". It concluded: \\"The platitudes and puerilities which might otherwise only raise a smile, when confronted with such pompous pretensions, excite the contempt of every man who has in him the feeblest instincts of common honesty in literature.\\" It proved successful enough for his publisher to announce another novel from him the next year. In 1864 Taylor and his wife Maria returned to the U.S. In 1866, Taylor traveled to Colorado and made a large loop through the northern mountains on horseback with a group that included William Byers, editor of the newspaper Rocky Mountain News. His letters describing this adventure were later compiled and published as Colorado: A Summer Trip. His late novel, Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania (1870), first serialized in the magazine The Atlantic, was described as a story of young man in rural Pennsylvania and \\"the troubles which arise from the want of a broader education and higher culture\\". It is believed to be based on the poets Fitz-Greene Halleck and Joseph Rodman Drake, and since the late 20th-century has been called America's first gay novel. Taylor spoke at the dedication of a monument to Halleck in his native town, Guilford, Connecticut. He said that in establishing this monument to an American poet \\"we symbolize the intellectual growth of the American people.... The life of the poet who sleeps here represents the long period of transition between the appearance of American poetry and the creation of an appreciative and sympathetic audience for it.\\"Hallock, John W. M. The American Byron: Homosexuality and the Fall of Fitz-Greene Halleck. University of Wisconsin Press, 2000: 151. Taylor imitated and parodied the writings of various poets in Diversions of the Echo Club (London, 1873; Boston, 1876). In 1874 Taylor traveled to Iceland to report for the Tribune on the one thousandth anniversary of the first European settlement there. During March 1878, the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment as United States Minister to Prussia. Mark Twain, who traveled to Europe on the same ship, was envious of Taylor's command of German. Taylor's travel writings were widely quoted by congressmen seeking to defend racial discrimination. Richard Townshend (D-IL) quoted passages from Taylor such as \\"the Chinese are morally, the most debased people on the face of the earth\\" and \\"A Chinese city is the greatest of all abominations.\\"13 Cong.

Evaluations Grave of Bayard Taylor in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania Though he wanted to be known most as a poet, Taylor was mostly recognized as a travel writer during his lifetime. Modern critics have generally accepted him as technically skilled in verse, but lacking imagination and, ultimately, consider his work as a conventional example of 19th-century sentimentalism.Rennick, Andrew. \\"Bayard Taylor\\" in Writers of the American Renaissance: An A to Z Guide.

Out of the five tracks included on this EP, four had already been previously released on the band's studio albums, although the band's first two albums The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Freaky Styley were not released in the UK until 1990, thus it provided a way of introducing tracks to new listeners.

The same recording of \\"Fire\\", however, would be later included once again on the band's next studio album Mother's Milk in tribute to Hillel Slovak, the band's original guitarist who died of a heroin overdose and plays guitar on the track. The title and cover was a tribute to The Beatles' famous album Abbey Road. Like the Beatles, the cover depicts the four bandmembers walking across a zebra crossing in single file, the twist being that they are all naked except for white tube socks covering their genitals. Wearing only socks in this manner was something they regularly employed in their stage shows at the time. All songs on the EP were also featured on the band's hits compilation, What Hits!?.

The leaves are alternate and almost stalkless. The leaf blades often have a brown or black spot in the centre and are narrowly ovate and have entire margins. Each leaf base has stipules which are fused into a stem-enclosing sheath that is loose and fringed with long hairs at the upper end. The inflorescence is a dense spike. The perianth of each tiny pink flower consists of four or five lobes, fused near the base. There are six stamens, two fused carpels and two styles. The fruit is a shiny black, three- edged achene.

Spotted lady's-thumb, redshank, renou√©e persicaire Taxonomy The species was first described, as Polygonum persicaria, by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It was first successfully transferred to the genus Persicaria by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, under the name Persicaria maculosa. The name \\"Persicaria persicaria\\" cannot be used because tautonyms ‚Äì binomial names that use the same word for both the genus and the species epithet ‚Äì are prohibited by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and a replacement name (nomen novum) must be used.International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) see section 23.4 For this reason the transfer of the species to Persicaria by John Kunkel Small in 1903, which used the tautonym, is invalid. Distribution and habitat Persicaria maculosa is native to Europe and Asia, where it can be mistaken for Polygonum minus. The latter has narrower leaves, usually less than 1 cm wide. It has been introduced to North America and is naturalised throughout the mainland continent,USDA growing along roadsides, riverbanks, and on fallow ground. In the United States, it is very similar to Pennsylvania smartweed, but redshank has a fringe of hairs at the top of the ochrea, something which Pennsylvania smartweed lacks. The species has also been found in New Zealand and Australia.Atlas of Living Australia, Persicaria maculosa Gray, Jesus PlantIUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Persicaria maculosa Ecology In the British Isles, this plant is a weed, without natural habitat, and always associated with human activity. It likes moist soils, particularly rich ones, and acid peaty loams. It does not like lime, and liming is cited as a means to fight it. Cultivation and uses Persicaria maculosa contains persicarin and tannins. The leaves and young shoots may be eaten as a palatable and nutritious leaf vegetable. It is often seen as a weed and rarely cultivated. A yellow dye can be produced from this plant with alum used as a mordant.

She is primarily remembered as the creator of an autobiographical series of paintings Leben? oder Theater?: Ein Singspiel (Life? or Theater?: A Song-play) consisting of 769 individual works painted between 1941 and 1943 in the south of France, while Salomon was in hiding from the Nazis. In October 1943 she was captured and deported to Auschwitz, where she and her unborn child were gassed to death by the Nazis soon after her arrival.Adam C. Stanley, \\"Salomon, Charlotte (1917‚Äì1943)\\" in Bernard A. Cook, Women and war: a historical encyclopedia from antiquity to the present, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 514. In 2015, a stunning nineteen-page confession by Salomon to the fatal poisoning of her grandfather, kept secret for decades, was released by a Parisian publisher. Biography Kristallnacht, 1940-42 Charlotte Salomon, gouache from Life? or Theater?, 1940-42 Charlotte Salomon came from a prosperous Berlin family. Her father, Albert Salomon was a surgeon; her mother, sensitive and troubled, committed suicide when Charlotte was eight or nine, though she was led to believe her mother died from influenza. The Guardian, 6 November 2019 Charlotte was sixteen when the Nazis came to power in 1933. She simply refused to go to school, and stayed at home. At a time when German universities were restricting their Jewish student quota to 1.5% of the student body (providing their fathers had served on the front line in the First World War), Salomon succeeded in gaining admission to the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandte Kunst (United State Schools for Pure and Applied Arts) in 1936. She studied painting there for two years, but by summer 1938 the antisemitic policy of Hitler's Third Reich meant that it was too dangerous for her to continue attending the college and she did not return, despite winning a prize. Salomon's father was briefly interned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp in November 1938, after Kristallnacht, and the Salomon family decided to leave Germany. Charlotte was sent to the South of France to live with her grandparents, already settled in Villefranche-sur- Mer near Nice. They lived in a cottage in the grounds of a luxurious villa L'Ermitage (now demolished) owned by a wealthy American, Ottilie Moore, who went on to shelter a number of Jewish children. Salomon left L'Ermitage with her grandparents to live in an apartment in Nice, where her grandmother attempted to hang herself in the bathroom. Her grandfather then revealed the truth to Charlotte about her mother's suicide, as well as the suicides of her aunt Charlotte, her great grandmother, her great uncle, and her grandmother's nephew. Shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939, Charlotte's grandmother succeeded in taking her own life. Her grandmother had stockpiled Veronal and morphine for when the German army arrived, but when she was denied access to her medication, she instead tried and failed to hang herself before eventually succeeding by throwing herself out of a window. Charlotte and her grandfather were interned by the French authorities in a bleak camp in the Pyrenees called Gurs. Charlotte recalls in Life? or Theater? that spending a night in a crowded train is preferable to spending one night with her grandfather: \\"I'd rather have ten more nights like this than a single one alone with him\\" . His constant request to share his bed with her and her own words in a confession letter of 35 pages made public in 2015 reveal the possibility of sexual abuse. They are released on account of her grandfather's infirmity. Her grandfather went back to Nice to live, and in Villefranche, Charlotte was facing a nervous breakdown after all the revelations, topped with the disgust for her grandfather. She wrote in Life? or Theater? that it was Herr Doktor L√ºdwig Gr√ºnwald, not \\"Herr Hitler\\", who \\"symbolized for me the people I had to resist. Dr George Morridis, the local doctor, advised her to paint. Salomon rented a room in the pension La Belle Aurore in Saint-Jean-Cap- Ferrat and there she commenced the work that would outlive her. She began her series of 769 paintings ‚Äì entitled Life? or Theater? ‚Äì by stating that she was driven by \\"the question: whether to take her own life or undertake something wildly unusual\\". In the space of two years, she painted over a thousand gouaches. She edited the paintings, re-arranged them, and added texts, captions, and overlays. She had a habit of humming songs to herself while painting. The entire work was a slightly fantastic autobiography preserving the main events of her life ‚Äì her mother's death, studying art in the shadow of the Third Reich, her relationship with her grandparents ‚Äì but altering the names and employing a strong element of fantasy. She also added notes about appropriate music to increase the dramatic effect, and she called Life? or Theater? a \\"Singespiel\\", or lyrical drama. In 1942, her residence permit depending on her being her grandfather's caretaker, she joined him in Nice. She then admittedly poisoned him with a home-made veronal omelette, drawing his portrait and writing a 35-page confession letter to her former lover Alfred Wolfsohn, who never received the letter. In 1943, as the Nazis intensified their search for Jews living in the South of France, Salomon handed the work to a local Villefranche doctor she was acquainted with, and addressed it to Ottilie Moore‚Äîthe German-American millionaire who owned the villa Salomon was hiding in at the time. She inscribed Moore's name at the top, and told the doctor: \\"Keep this safe, it is my whole life.\\" Moore, who passed on the package to Charlotte's remaining family, only received the package upon her return to Europe in 1947, after the war's end. By September 1943, Salomon had married another German Jewish refugee, Alexander Nagler. The two of them were dragged from their house and transported by rail from Nice to the Nazi \\"processing centre\\" at Drancy near Paris. By now, Salomon was five months pregnant. She was transported to Auschwitz on 7 October 1943 and was probably gassed on the same day that she arrived there, October 10.Biographical information from Mary Lowenthal Felstiner, To Paint Her Life: Charlotte Salomon in the Nazi Era, Harper Collins, 1994 and Adam C. Stanley, \\"Salomon, Charlotte (1917‚Äì1943)\\" in Bernard A. Cook, Women and war: a historical encyclopedia from antiquity to the present, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, pp. 513‚Äì514. Life? or Theater? (Leben? oder Theater?) Charlotte and her grandparents This series of gouaches is an extraordinary and unique document. In great detail it tells the story of Salomon's family and friends, her own internal life, the political background, and her obsessive love affair. Salomon had artistic training and her household was highly cultured. The way she tells her story is full of tragedy, but the telling also reveals Salomon's sly humour and wit. The series starts out with highly detailed and multi-layered images of the life and relationship between her mother and father. As the story unfolds the style gets broader and more expressionistic. The last 'chapters' are almost violent in their expression, as if Salomon is aware of her impending fate and can hardly wait to write and paint the details of her story as the Gestapo close in on her life. A large part of Life? or Theater? is about her obsession with Amadeus Daberlohn, a voice teacher she met through her stepmother Paulinka Bimbam (Salomon gives all her characters humorous, often punning, pseudonyms). These sections are honest and compelling accounts of her passionate relationship with Alfred Wolfsohn ‚Äì the one person who took her artistic work seriously. It is not possible to know if Salomon's version of her relationship with Wolfsohn corresponds with reality, but he was undoubtedly her first love.Charlotte Salomon: Life or Theater. The Viking Press, New York, 1981. . In 1943, when she was 26, Charlotte Salomon gave her collection of paintings to Dr. Moridis, a trusted friend who had counseled her through her depression. Life? or Theater? is intended as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a Wagnerian 'total work of art' within the tradition of the ambitious nineteenth century German idea to fuse poetry, music and the visual arts. Yet Salomon's work is a reversal of that tradition which was intended to be the ultimate manifestation of Germanic culture ‚Äì instead it is a deeply moving and personal masterpiece, created by a \\"young woman who belonged to a supposedly alien race and who was therefore held not to even have a right to exist, let alone a place in society.\\"Norman Rosenthal p. 9, Charlotte Salomon, Life? or Theater?; Royal Academy of Arts 1998; = Transparencies = The work includes some two hundred transparencies carrying text intended to overlay their associated gouaches. The example illustrated is typical. It is the closing gouache of Scene 1 of the Prelude and depicts the fictional Charlotte Kann (representing Salomon herself) in bed with her mother Franziska, who is telling Charlotte how wonderful it is in Heaven and how one day she (Franziska) will go there and turn into an angel and bring Charlotte a letter to lie on her windowsill describing life in Heaven. = Signature image = The \\"signature image\\" (cf. Michael Steinberg 2005, p. 1) of Life? or Theater? occurs as the final image of the concluding Epilogue section. Steinberg is reminded of Franz Kafka's short story In the Penal Colony, in which sentence of execution is inscribed on the victim's back, and describes the image as combining the innocence of the mermaid of Copenhagen with violent narrative. Because of the nature of the work, it requires three images adequately to convey it. The image on the left is of the last page (verso) of four pages of densely packed text, carried on both sides, that conclude the epilogue. The center image is the final example of the transparent overlays that occur throughout the work, while the rightmost image is the gouache most closely associated with the work, depicting Charlotte Salomon kneeling before the sea with brush and paper in her hand and the words Life or Theater inscribed on her back. The concluding words of the epilogue, quoting ideas of Alfred Wolfsohn, are as follows: :{ ...und sie sah ‚Äì mit wachgetr√§umten Augen all die Sch√∂nheit um sich her ‚Äì sah das Meer sp√ºrte die Sonne und wusste: sie musste f√ºr eine Zeit von der menschlichen Oberfl√§che verschwinden und daf√ºr alle Opfer bringen ‚Äì um sich aus der Tiefe ihre Welt neu zu schaffen Und dabei entstand das Leben oder das Theater??? ... And with dream awakened eyes she saw all the beauty around her, saw the sea, felt the sun, and knew she had to vanish for a while from the human surface and make every sacrifice in order to create her world anew out of the depths. And from that came Life or Theater??? } Singespiel Singespiel Salomon entitled her work, Leben? oder Theater?: Ein Singespiel. Singspiel is a German music form resembling \\"operetta\\" in some respects, although actors' parts are often spoken over, rather than sung with the music. The form is heavily influenced the English ballad opera, early examples being translations of existing ballad operas. Music provides the backdrop for the play-form which is most often comical in nature, tragedy being a less-frequent motif. Romantic interest nearly always plays a prominent part. Singspiel was considered less elevated than opera proper, often being written in the vernacular.Branscombe, Peter: \\"Singspiel\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Ed. Stanley Sadie and J. Tyrrell (London: Macmillan, 2001), vol. 18, pp. 438‚Äì39. While celebrated composers such as Mozart and Schubert are known to have worked in the form, Singspiel often introduced folksongs, marches and narrative songs into its repertoire. By the early twentieth century, at the time of Salomon's appropriation of the form into her work, the Singspiel had ceased to be a contemporary form (although Ralph Benatzky's popular 1930 work Im wei√üen R√∂√ül is a singspiel and Kurt Weill introduced the term 'songspiel' to describe some of his collaborations with Berthold Brecht). Note that Salomon's spelling, \\"Singespiel\\", adds an \\"e\\", but whether this was intentional or not is unclear. Thus, Life? or Theater? is not only a series of paintings. It includes a script in the form of words that are either themselves in the form of paintings, written into the paintings, or presented as overlays to the images. It also has a \\"soundtrack\\" ‚Äì music chosen by Salomon that reinforces her stories. These range from Nazi marching songs to Schubert lieder and extracts from the music of Mozart and Mahler. The work is operatic in scale, highly modern in execution, unique in its form, and has an enduring power. Gallery of Works File:Charlotte S.jpgCharlotte Salomon, Self-portrait, 1940; gouache-paint on cardboard  Reputation  = In exhibitions and art history = The paintings that make up Life? or Theater? began to be exhibited in the 1960s only, the first book with 80 reproductions was published in 1963, and drew comparisons with the story of Anne Frank.Felstiner 1994. Marc Chagall was shown the paintings and was impressed. In 1971 the collection was placed in the care of the Joods Historisch Museum, Amsterdam. In 1981 the Museum presented 250 scenes in narrative sequence, and critics began to comment on the work. An exhibition at the London Royal Academy in 1998 was an unexpected sensation, helped by the publication of a complete catalogue.Griselda Pollock (2005 p. 34 n. 1) however criticised the 1981 catalogue as presenting a too specific framing of the work. The choice of cover art, the self-portrait uncharacteristic of her work in general with its transparent quotation of Vincent van Gogh's self portraiture and the single intimate cover title \\"Charlotte\\", establishes too early an unquestioned framing of the work as autobiographical and dramaturgy, and genders Salomon. The work is still relatively little known, in part because Salomon's work doesn't appear on the international art market, as the whole archive belongs to the protective Charlotte Salomon Foundation based at the Joods Historisch Museum. The art historian Griselda Pollock dedicated to Charlotte Salomon a chapter in her Virtual Feminist Museum, analysing her work in terms of contemporary art, Jewish history and cultural theory.Griselda Pollock, Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive. Routledge, 2007. Charlotte Salomon, world premiere at the Salzburg Festival 2014 = In the performing arts = There have been several other exhibitions of parts of Life? or Theater?, and a number of films and plays made about Charlotte Salomon's life, notably Company of Angels (2002) by the UK theatre company Horse and Bamboo Theatre which toured the UK, Netherlands and USA and in 1981, Dutch director Frans Weisz released a feature film based on her life, entitled Charlotte, with the Austrian actress playing the artist and Daberlohn played by Derek Jacobi. In 2011 he made a documentary revealing the contents of her last letter to Wolfsohn. Saving Charlotte, a play by Judi Herman, was performed at the Bridewell Theatre, London, in October/November 1998. Lotte's Journey, a play by Candida Cave, was performed at New End Theatre, Hampstead, in October/November 2007. In remembrance of the artist, French composer Marc-Andr√© Dalbavie dedicated an opera to her: Charlotte Salomon, commissioned by the Salzburg Festival. The libretto by Barbara Honigmann is based on the gouaches Leben? oder Theater? and integrates them into the performance in form of projections. The main role of Charlotte is performed by two artists, an actress and a singer. Most of the singing is done in French while the spoken parts are in German. The world premiere took place at Salzburg's Felsenreitschule on 28 July 2014 on a panorama stage of 30 meters, conducted by the composer and directed by Luc Bondy. The two Charlotte Salomon roles were spoken by German Johanna Wokalek and sung by French Marianne Crebassa. The opera and its production received rave reviews by public and press. A novel, Charlotte, written by David Foenkinos, was published in 2014, which won the prestigious French literary prize Le prix Th√©ophraste Renaudot, among other prizes. In February 2015, the Musiktheater im Revier (MiR) in Gelsenkirchen presented a ballet-opera by Michelle DiBucci based on life and work of the artist. Its title was Charlotte Salomon: Der Tod und die Malerin (Death and the Painter); it was choreographed and directed by Bridget Breiner. Again the autobiographical work Life? or Theater? formed the basis for the dramatization. DiBucci was originally commissioned to compose an opera on the life and work of Salomon by director for the 2010 Ruhrtriennale. The work was not completed due to the death of Zimmermann in 2007. Several years later, DiBucci was approached by choreographer Bridget Breiner and asked to adapt the work into a full-length ballet. Charlotte Salomon: Der Tod und die Malerin was the winner of a 2015 Der Faust, Germany's highest honor in theatre. Bridget Breiner received the award for Best Choreography. In 2017, to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Charlotte Salomon's birth, ‚Ä≥CHARLOTTE: A Tri-Coloured Play with Music‚Ä≥ (Composer: Ale≈° Brezina, Librettist: Alon Nashman, Director/Scenographer: Pamela Howard) was presented at the Luminato Festival in Toronto, and at the World Stage Design Festival, in Taipei, Taiwan. This singspiel, which \\"gives Salomon a wonderfully authentic and persuasive voice onstage\\", has music by Czech composer Ale≈° B≈ôezina, a libretto by Canadian performer/writer Alon Nashman, and is directed and designed by UK-based Pamela Howard, author of \\"What is Scenography?\\". ‚Ä≥CHARLOTTE: A Tri-Coloured Play with Music‚Ä≥ was developed with the assistance of Canadian Stage Company, and the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts. The role of Charlotte was played by Canadian soprano Adanya Dunn. Film director Bibo Bergeron (who directed The Road to El Dorado and Shark Tale for DreamWorks) is presently making a movie about Charlotte Salomon's life and work, called Charlotte, with a 10 million euro budget.  Commemoration  Stolperstein in Berlin Since 1992 a primary school in Berlin bears the name of the artist, in 2006 a street in Berlin-Rummelsburg was named after her. On April 21, 2012 a Stolperstein in front of her former residential house in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Wielandstra√üe 15, was dedicated to Charlotte Salomon. In addition a Memorial Plaque on the facade of the building commemorates the artist.Charlotte-Salomon-Grundschule: Charlotte Salomons Leben - eine kurze Biografie  Notes   References   Sources  * Charlotte Salomon: Life or Theater.

It is a part of the municipality of Waterland, and is situated about 8 km south of Purmerend and 8 km northeast of Amsterdam. In the 17th and 18th century, the town was a popular residence for merchants and seafarers from Amsterdam. Due to its monument status, much of its history has been preserved. History =Early years= Many of the houses in the village date back to before 1850. Before 1940 there had been only limited housing development. This meant that many houses were divided to accommodate several families under the same roof. The church of Broek in Waterland was built before 1400 and was dedicated to Saint Nicolas. On September 26, 1573 the church was razed to the ground by Spaniards during the Eighty Years' War. In 1628 the inhabitants of Broek in Waterland started to rebuild the church on the foundations of the old building. The pulpit was donated to the church in 1685 by a wealthy couple who were married there in 1641. It is made of ebony, rosewood and pallisander wood, which give it a dark colour and delicate texture. The church organ was built in 1832 by Wander Beekes. The church was extensively renovated in 1989. During this renovation, the original ceiling frescoes of cherubs and fruit garlands were rediscovered under old layers of paint. =Tourist attraction= Broek in Waterland was a popular vacation village for sea captains in the 1600s. The town has always been famous for its cleanliness. Many 17th and 18th century travel books of foreign travellers mentioned the cleanliness and tidiness of the village. > The extreme cleanliness of Broek in Waterland led French visitors in the > first half of the eighteenth century to dub this dairying village \\"le temple > de la propret√© hollandaise\\". =Part of the municipality of Waterland= Broek in Waterland was a separate municipality until 1991, when it was merged with Waterland.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \\"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\\", KNAW, 2006.

It is in the border of Sri Jayawardenapura Municipal Council Limits and Dehiwela Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council Limits, just outside Colombo City Limits. Central Nugegoda is a collection of densely packed shops and mixed residential areas. History Nugegoda was a small town a few decades ago but has seen a high degree of growth and development recently. Known as Dimbulgas Handiya in the past, the name ‚ÄúNugegoda‚Äù is assumed to come from the term ‚ÄúNugen Egoda‚Äù. It was known to be largely a very flat landscape with marshlands. In the 1960s there were already several established stores along the main street, known then as Church Road. It was renamed Stanley Tilekeratne Mawatha after the popular politician in the 1970s during the wave of Sinhala nationalisation and when the road was widened to accommodate the increased traffic. Nugegoda had its own cinema house and was also a major train station along what was the Kelani Valley line - one of the last active single gauge train lines. There has been a huge increase in buildings and a great reduction in trees and green areas. Agricultural lands like paddy fields (still present in the early 1990s) have largely been used for building and development. At present, a number of educational institutes are found here, such as St.John's College-Nugegoda, Anula Vidyalaya, Samudradevi Balika Maha Vidhyalaya (originally St John's Girls' School), Sakya Institute and the famous Rotary Tuition Classes. On 29 November 2007, more than 25 civilians were killed and more than 50 were injured when a bomb believed to be planted by members of the LTTE terrorist group exploded outside a clothing store at a traffic junction near Nugegoda. The Defence Ministry said shops and several private vehicles were damaged, and the hospital spokeswoman said more casualties were feared. A newly created flyover has been constructed and open for public usage on 23 January 2009. The first stage is directed towards Maharagama - Colombo. The Government says the second stage will be started in the near future. Economy Nugegoda is a consumer hotspot especially during the festive seasons. Nugegoda is also famous for its high quality clothing stores near the famous Bogaha Junction in the Highlevel Road which sits besides a famed Bo tree. Nugegoda is also the hub city of Sri Lanka's number one book store chain Sarasavi Bookshop. The Nugegoda \\"Pola\\" is one of the major markets in Sri Lanka full of various vegetables, fruits, fish & meats, it is active throughout the week. The \\"Sathi Pola\\" in the Delkanda borough is probably one of the most acclaimed markets in Sri Lanka. The weekly market takes place on every Sunday besides the Highlevel road and has any agricultural product one can ask for. The Mirihana borough hosts the Mirihana Police Station which host the Communication Division HQ of Sri Lanka Police as well as the offices of DIG Western Province South and SSP Nugegoda.

Although also a utilitarian accessory, it is best known for its use in zazen Zen meditation. Name Although zafu is often translated as \\"sewn seat\\" in American English, the meaning of the Japanese kanji, Â∫ßËí≤, is different. Za (Â∫ß) means \\"seat\\", and fu (Ëí≤) means reedmace (cattail, Typha spp.). A zafu is a seat stuffed with the fluffy, soft, downy fibres of the disintegrating reedmace seed heads. The Japanese zafu originates in China, where these meditation seats were originally filled with reedmace down. The words zabuton, zafuton and futon are closely linked. The word zazen meaning \\"seated meditation\\" or \\"sitting meditation\\" is also closely linked. In western usage, zafu refers to a meditation cushion, and zabuton refers to the cushioned mat upon which a zafu is placed. Construction Typical zafus are about in diameter,Introduction to Buddhism and the Practice of Zazen, page 14 and often about high when fluffed. Contemporary zafus are sewn from three pieces of heavy cloth, usually colored black: two round swatches of equal size for the top and the bottom of the cushion, and a long rectangle that is sewn into gathers in between. They are typically filled with either kapok (a fluffy plant fibre, similar to Typha) or buckwheat hulls. Zen Buddhist practitioners traditionally sit on a zafu when engaged in sitting meditation. The cushion raises the hips, making the entire range of cross-legged sitting positions more stable for the meditator. Use in zazen A typical kapok-filled zabuton Before and after practicing zazen, Zen practitioners perform a gassho bow to the zafu, to fellow practitioners, and to the teacher. In many practice places, there is a prescribed form for respectfully handling zafu while walking in the meditation hall, or zendo. A zabuton (, ) is a rectangular cushion, about by , that is often used under a zafu cushion to provide comfort and support when engaged in zazen. The outer cover is typically made of a heavy duty fabric and has a zipper along one side so that it can be easily removed and washed. Inside the cover, the batting is enclosed in a natural cotton casing.

Chosen Companions, or Hetairoi, formed the elite guard of the king (Somatophylakes).  Etymology  The name of the military unit derives from Greek Hetairoi, those near the king. The Hetairoi (Companions) could be members of the Macedonian aristocracy or commoners of any origin who enjoyed the trust and friendship of the Macedonian regent. The Hetairideia, a festival pertaining to the sacred relationship which bound the king and his companions togetherWinthrop Lindsay Adams. Alexander the Great: legacy of a conqueror. p 8. .

(1983) The Royal friends (Philoi) or the king's Companions (basilikoi hetairoi) were named for life by the king among the Macedonian aristocracy.  Unit  = Equipment = A heavy cavalryman of Alexander the Great's army, possibly a Thessalian, though the Companion cavalry would have been almost identical (the shape of the cloak of the latter was more rounded). He wears a cuirass (probably a linothorax) and a Boeotian helmet, and is equipped with a scabbarded xiphos straight-bladed sword. Alexander Sarcophagus. Companion cavalry would ride the best horses, and receive the best weaponry available. In Alexander's day, each carried a xyston, and wore a bronze muscle cuirass or linothorax, shoulder guards and Boeotian helmets, but bore no shield.Lonsdale 40 A kopis (curved slashing sword) or xiphos (cut and thrust sword) was also carried for close combat, should the xyston break. = Organization = The Companion cavalry was composed of the Hetairoi of the king, mainly upper class citizens who were able to acquire and maintain armour and horses. In the age of Philip II and Alexander they were organized into 8 territorial squadrons, termed ilai. Each ile numbered between 200 and 300 horsemen.Fuller 49 They were originally commanded by a single leader, Philotas under Alexander the Great, but following his execution would see the leadership split between two men, Cleitus the Black and Hephaestion. Arrian claims this would be because, Alexander \\"did not want anyone, not even his intimate friend, to be the centre of attention\\".Sage 185 After receiving reinforcements in Susa, Alexander established two companies in each squadron.Arrian, Alexander's Anabasis, III.16 They were referred to by the name of the territory they were mustered in or by the name of its captain. The Royal Ile was commanded by Alexander himself and contained twice the number of soldiers the other units contained, c. 400.Lansdale 41 These cavalry squadrons would sometimes be combined together in groups of two, three or four to form a hipparchy, which was commanded by a hipparch, though the whole Companion force was generally commanded by Alexander. In Alexander's Balkan campaigns, we find mention of Companions from upper Macedonia, the central Macedonian plain and Amphipolis.Hammond 414 During the advance on Granicus, a squadron commanded by Socrates of Macedon (not to be confused with the philosopher) hailed from Apollonia on Lake Bolbe.Hammond 416 During the Battle of Issus, Arrian names the ile of Anthemus (modern Galatista),; another, from the unidentified land of Leuge (likely Pieria), is also mentioned.Hammond 415 Theopompus describes the Companions, probably of around the mid 4th century BC, as being made of \\"no more than 800 at this time\\" and mustered \\"some from Macedonia, some from Thessaly and still others from the rest of Greece\\".Sage 173‚Äì174 By 338 BC, Alexander is reported to have had around 2600 in his Companion Cavalry.Sage 174 As Alexander's force campaigned towards India, barbarians played an increasing role in the Companion Cavalry and the Macedonian mutiny at Opis may have been partially caused by this.Lansdale 56Arrian, Alexander's Anabasis VII.6 At one point, there were four hipparchies made up of entirely oriental forces and one that was a mix of Macedonians and orientals. = Tactics and use = Macedonian Companion cavalry ile in wedge formation The Companions probably constituted the first real shock cavalry in history, able to conduct charges against massed infantry, even if such use is scarcely described in the ancient sources. Contemporary cavalry, even when heavily armored, would most usually be equipped with javelins and would avoid melee. In battle, it would form part of a hammer and anvil tactic: the Companion cavalry would be used as a hammer, in conjunction with the Macedonian phalanx-based infantry, which acted as their anvil. The phalanx would pin the enemy in place, while the Companion cavalry would attack the enemy on the flank or from behind. In battle, Alexander the Great personally led the charge at the head of the royal squadron of the Companion cavalry, usually in a wedge formation. In a pitched battle, the Companions usually fought on the right wing of the Macedonian army, next to the shield-bearing guards, the hypaspists, who would guard the right flank of the phalanx. Other cavalry troops would protect the flanks of the Macedonian line during battle. Under Alexander's command, the Companions' role was decisive in most of his battles in Asia.  Legacy  = Hellenistic kingdoms = The Companions of Alexander the Great The Companion cavalry of the Diadochoi (Alexandrian successor-states), were even more heavily equipped. Seleucid Companions were noted to have worn lighter, but not otherwise dissimilar, equipment to the cataphracts at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, which may have included partial horse armour and leg and arm protection. Ptolemaic Companions and Antigonid Companions were also equipped with a large round aspis cavalry shield unlike the Companions of Phillip and Alexander. ‚ÄòCompanions‚Äô was a title not used by the Seleucids in its original sense. It was replaced with different and various grades of ‚ÄòKings Friends'. However, the title 'Companions' was kept as a regimental one. There was only one regiment or unit that held the title of Companions in the entire Hellenistic world though; the Antigonids and Ptolemies had different names for their elite cavalry regiments. = Eastern Roman Empire = The Hetaireia or Hetaeria was a corps of bodyguards during the Byzantine Empire. Its name means \\"the Company\\", echoing the ancient Macedonian Companion cavalry. The imperial Hetaireia was composed chiefly of foreigners. They acted as part of the Byzantine imperial guard alongside the tagmata in the 9th‚Äì12th centuries.

T., 2003, Probability Theory: the Logic of Science, Cambridge University Press, see pg. xx of Preface and pg. 43. with the works of Jacob Bernoulli and Pierre-Simon Laplace. As stated in Laplace's Th√©orie analytique des probabilit√©s, :The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to it, to the number of all cases possible when nothing leads us to expect that any one of these cases should occur more than any other, which renders them, for us, equally possible. This definition is essentially a consequence of the principle of indifference. If elementary events are assigned equal probabilities, then the probability of a disjunction of elementary events is just the number of events in the disjunction divided by the total number of elementary events. The classical definition of probability was called into question by several writers of the nineteenth century, including John Venn and George Boole. The frequentist definition of probability became widely accepted as a result of their criticism, and especially through the works of R.A. Fisher. The classical definition enjoyed a revival of sorts due to the general interest in Bayesian probability, because Bayesian methods require a prior probability distribution and the principle of indifference offers one source of such a distribution. Classical probability can offer prior probabilities that reflect ignorance which often seems appropriate before an experiment is conducted. History As a mathematical subject, the theory of probability arose very late‚Äîas compared to geometry for example‚Äîdespite the fact that we have prehistoric evidence of man playing with dice from cultures from all over the world. While the evidence presented for games analogous to \\"dice\\" in prehistory is somewhat conjectural (archaeological), the evidence is strong for such games in distant (c. 3500 B.C.E.) history (writings and paintings). One of the earliest writers on probability was Gerolamo Cardano. He perhaps produced the earliest known definition of classical probability. Cardano placed too much emphasis on luck (and too little on mathematics) to be regarded as the father of probability. The text contains 5 historical definitions of classical probability by Cardano, Leibniz, Bernoulli, de Moivre and Laplace. Only the last, by Laplace, was fully appreciated and used. The sustained development of probability began in the year 1654 when Blaise Pascal had some correspondence with his father's friend Pierre de Fermat about two problems concerning games of chance he had heard from the Chevalier de M√©r√© earlier the same year, whom Pascal happened to accompany during a trip. One problem was the so-called problem of points, a classic problem already then (treated by Luca Pacioli as early as 1494, and even earlier in an anonymous manuscript in 1400), dealing with the question how to split the money at stake in a fair way when the game at hand is interrupted half-way through. The other problem was one about a mathematical rule of thumb that seemed not to hold when extending a game of dice from using one die to two dice. This last problem, or paradox, was the discovery of M√©r√© himself and showed, according to him, how dangerous it was to apply mathematics to reality.James Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal (2001) The Johns Hopkins University Press Pascal, Oeuvres Compl√®tes 2:1142 They discussed other mathematical-philosophical issues and paradoxes as well during the trip that M√©r√© thought was strengthening his general philosophical view. Pascal, in disagreement with M√©r√©'s view of mathematics as something beautiful and flawless but poorly connected to reality, determined to prove M√©r√© wrong by solving these two problems within pure mathematics. When he learned that Fermat, already recognized as a distinguished mathematician, had reached the same conclusions, he was convinced they had solved the problems conclusively. This correspondence circulated among other scholars at the time, in particular, to Huygens, Roberval and indirectly Caramuel, and marks the starting point for when mathematicians in general began to study problems from games of chance. The correspondence did not mention \\"probability\\"; It focused on fair prices. Half a century later, Jacob Bernoulli showed a sophisticated grasp of probability. He showed facility with permutations and combinations, discussed the concept of probability with examples beyond the classical definition (such as personal, judicial and financial decisions) and showed that probabilities could be estimated by repeated trials with uncertainty diminished as the number of trials increased. The 1765 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's classic Encyclop√©die contains a lengthy discussion of probability and summary of knowledge up to that time. A distinction is made between probabilities \\"drawn from the consideration of nature itself\\" (physical) and probabilities \\"founded only on the experience in the past which can make us confidently draw conclusions for the future\\" (evidential).Lubi√®res, Charles-Benjamin, baron de. \\"Probability.\\" The Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project.

The source of a clear and lasting definition of probability was Laplace. As late as 1814 he stated: This description is what would ultimately provide the classical definition of probability. Laplace published several editions of multiple documents (technical and a popularization) on probability over a half-century span. Many of his predecessors (Cardano, Bernoulli, Bayes) published a single document posthumously. Criticism The classical definition of probability assigns equal probabilities to events based on physical symmetry which is natural for coins, cards and dice. * Some mathematicians object that the definition is circular. The probability for a \\"fair\\" coin is... A \\"fair\\" coin is defined by a probability of... * The definition is very limited. It says nothing about cases where no physical symmetry exists. Insurance premiums, for example, can only be rationally priced by measured rates of loss. * It is not trivial to justify the principle of indifference except in the simplest and most idealized of cases (an extension of the problem limited definition). Coins are not truly symmetric. Can we assign equal probabilities to each side? Can we assign equal probabilities to any real world experience? However limiting, the definition is accompanied with substantial confidence. Much of the mathematics of probability was developed on the basis of this simplistic definition. Alternative interpretations of probability (for example frequentist and subjective) also have problems. Mathematical probability theory deals in abstractions, avoiding the limitations and philosophical complications of any probability interpretation. References * Pierre-Simon de Laplace.

Background G√∂mb√∂s was born in Murga, Tolna County, Kingdom of Hungary, which had a mixed Hungarian and ethnic German population. He was the son of Gyula G√∂mb√∂s de J√°kfa (1858-1921), member of untitled Hungarian nobility and Maria Weitzel (b.1867). His father was the village schoolmaster. The family belonged to the Hungarian Evangelical (i. e. Lutheran) Church. G√∂mb√∂s entered the Austro-Hungarian Army as a cadet in P√©cs and quickly became a member of the officer corps, serving as a captain during World War I. While in the army, G√∂mb√∂s became a staunch advocate of Hungary's gaining independence from Austria and a bitter critic of the Habsburgs. After World War I ended and Hungary split from Austria, G√∂mb√∂s joined Conservative Hungarian forces in Szeged that were unwilling to support Communist B√©la Kun, who had seized control of Hungary in 1919, forming his own paramilitary group, the Hungarian National Defence Association (Magyar Orsz√°gos V√©der≈ë Egylet, or MOVE). G√∂mb√∂s became a close ally of Mikl√≥s Horthy, the leader of the anti-Communist government in Szeged, and played a leading role in organizing Horthy‚Äôs army. For his services, G√∂mb√∂s was made minister of defense in the Szeged government. After Kun‚Äôs government was ousted in August 1919, G√∂mb√∂s helped direct the purge of Communists from Hungarian society. G√∂mb√∂s supported certain political actions against Hungary's Jews. Rightward G√∂mb√∂s had been a Smallholder before the war, but veered sharply to the right in the upheaval following the breakup of Austria-Hungary. After Mikl√≥s Horthy was made regent of Hungary in 1920, G√∂mb√∂s became the primary leader of Hungary‚Äôs emerging nationalist movement, which was gaining some support from the people in response to the brief period of Communist rule and the signing of the Treaty of Trianon, which resulted in Hungary losing two- thirds of its territory to neighboring nations. Despite some disagreements with Horthy, G√∂mb√∂s was active in the widespread purge of Hungarian Communists and later organized mass military opposition to the Habsburg pretender Charles IV's plan to regain his throne in 1921, a move which kept Horthy firmly in control of Hungary. Later that year, G√∂mb√∂s became one of the primary leaders of the opposition to Prime Minister Istv√°n Bethlen. In 1929, G√∂mb√∂s was made a major general and appointed Minister of Defense in the Bethlen government by Horthy. Prime minister In 1932, Horthy appointed G√∂mb√∂s prime minister; G√∂mb√∂s, in turn, acceded to Horthy's urging not to seek new elections. Upon taking office, G√∂mb√∂s publicly recanted his previous antipathy to Jews. The country's Jewish political leadership under Bela Szanto supported the appointment of G√∂mb√∂s and his programs in exchange for G√∂mb√∂s promising not to enact any racially motivated laws, and not to cause economic harm to the Jews through his general policies. These promises G√∂mb√∂s kept. Gyula G√∂mb√∂s in full regalia As prime minister, G√∂mb√∂s was very active in international affairs, seeking support for revising the Treaty of Trianon and pursuing trade deals aimed at reviving the Depression-afflicted economy. One of his major goals was to align Hungary into an Axis with Italy and Austria. In 1933, G√∂mb√∂s flew to Italy and visited Benito Mussolini. Mussolini conveyed to G√∂mb√∂s his approval regarding the revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Also, Mussolini promised G√∂mb√∂s Italy‚Äôs aid if Hungary went to war with Yugoslavia and Romania in an attempt to regain Hungary‚Äôs former territory from those nations. G√∂mb√∂s also formed, with rather greater reluctance, an alliance with Germany. When Hitler became Chancellor, G√∂mb√∂s was the first foreign head of government to visit the Nazi leader. Shortly after, G√∂mb√∂s signed a major trade agreement with Germany, doing so in the hope of reducing Hungary's unemployment rate as the 1930s progressed. This amity, though, failed to endure. Not only did Hitler consider G√∂mb√∂s to be far too pro-Jewish, but he made it clear to G√∂mb√∂s that his support of Hungary had a price. While the German dictator voiced willingness to take Hungary's side in any effort that Hungary carried out to regain land from Czechoslovakia, he would not support Hungary against the territorial ambitions of either Romania or Yugoslavia. Unlike Mussolini, Hitler also resented G√∂mb√∂s‚Äô plans to expand the size and power of the Hungarian military. Death in office However, G√∂mb√∂s never lived to see his ambitious plans come to fruition. G√∂mb√∂s, after a long illness, died of testicular cancer in Munich on 6 October 1936.Earlier accounts had kidney failure as the cause of death. See Burial G√∂mb√∂s was buried at Kerepesi Cemetery among exceptional circumstances; his funeral procession was attended by hundreds of thousands of Hungarians, and his catafalque was visited by many dignitaries because he was the head of the government.

General forms Slip joints can be designed to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment, by unclamping from one fixed position, and re-clamping to another. Examples of the latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The clamping mechanism is based on a cam, a set screw or similar locking mechanism. Slip joints can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's levelling rods. These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport. Examples of continuous slip joints are given below. Special purpose slip joints =Civil engineering= Slip joints in large structures are used to allow independent motion of large components while enabling them to be joined in some way. For example, if two tall buildings are to be joined with a pedestrian skyway at some high level, there are two options in structural engineering. If the buildings are identical in mass and elasticity they will tend to respond similarly to ground motion induced by earthquakes. In this case it may be appropriate to construct a rigid connection between the buildings, although this may require additional supporting members within the structures. On the other hand, a lower cost connection may be made by using a lightweight structure that is not coupled rigidly but instead which is allowed to slide or \\"float\\" relative to one or both structures. This is especially suitable where the two structures may respond differently to ground motion. The structure will not be completely free to move but rather may use elastic materials to locate it near the center of its range of motion and viscous shock absorbers to absorb energy and to restrict the speed of relative motion. When a sliding connection is used it is extremely important that there be sufficient range of motion without failure to accommodate the maximum credible relative motion of the structures. Additional \\"fail safe\\" flexible connections may be added to ensure that the structure does not fall, although it may be damaged to a point of being unserviceable or unrepairable. Slip joints are common under conditions where temperature changes can cause expansion and contraction that may overstress a structure. These are generally referred to as expansion joints. Bridges and overpasses frequently have sliding joints that allow a deck to move relative to piers or abutments. The joints can be constructed with elastomeric pads that permit motion or can use rollers on flat surfaces to allow the ends to move smoothly. The exact details are limited by the imagination of the designer. =Mechanical engineering= Slip joints are sometimes found in tubular structures such as piping, but are generally avoided for this application due to requirements for sealing against leakage, instead using either a large loop that is allowed to flex or a semi- rigid bellows. Slip joints are used when the main problem is a large axial movement.Slip Type Expansion Joints U.S. Bellows, (retrieved January 2012) Pipe supports often are slip joints to allow for the thermal expansion or contraction of the pipe relative to the support. =Waste water plumbing= Slip joint connections are also commonly used in waste water plumbing, most commonly under kitchen sinks. Here, the slip joint provides a water-tight seal for non-pressurized drainage, with adjustability to aid installation. The slip joint includes a gasket that fits snugly on a pipe end, with a threaded nut behind the gasket, but with gasket position adjustable as needed. This pipe end fits loosely into another with a flange for the gasket to seal against, and threads for the nut to clamp the gasket to the flange.

It rises in Macclesfield Forest at the western end of the Peak District, and can be seen in spring form, from the Buxton to Macclesfield road. The stream then descends the through Macclesfield and The Carrs Park in Wilmslow where it has a confluence with the River Dean, near to Styal Prison. For the following it defines the southwestern portion of the border between Greater Manchester and Cheshire before merging with the River Mersey north of Lymm. It flows through the Styal country park and was used in the cotton calico factory there, Quarry Bank Mill, as a source of power. Near to the Quarry Bank Mill site there is a natural weir. The Bollin is culverted underneath the southern runway of Manchester Airport. The town of Macclesfield used to dispose all its waste and sewage into the Bollin. The profusion of human sewage in the Bollin was still common in 1850.

Its purposes include carrying sails, spars, and derricks, and giving necessary height to a navigation light, look-out position, signal yard, control position, radio aerial or signal lamp.Layton, Cyril Walter Thomas, Peter Clissold, and A. G. W. Miller. Dictionary of nautical words and terms. Brown, Son & Ferguson, 1973. Large ships have several masts, with the size and configuration depending on the style of ship. Nearly all sailing masts are guyed.Harland, John. Seamanship in the Age of Sail, pp. 22-5, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. . Until the mid-19th century, all vessels' masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which typically consisted of the trunk of a conifer tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and royal masts. Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood. Such a section was known as a made mast, as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber, which were known as pole masts. Those who specialised in making masts were known as mastmakers. Nomenclature For square-sail carrying ship, the masts, given their standard names in bow to stern (front to back) order, are: * Sprit topmast: a small mast set on the end of the bowsprit (discontinued after the early 18th century); not usually counted as a mast, however, when identifying a ship as \\"two-masted\\" or \\"three-masted\\" * Fore-mast: the mast nearest the bow, or the mast forward of the main-mast ** Sections: fore-mast lower‚Äîfore topmast‚Äîfore topgallant mast * Main-mast: the tallest mast, usually located near the center of the ship ** Sections: main-mast lower‚Äîmain topmast‚Äîmain topgallant mast‚Äîroyal mast (if fitted) * Mizzen-mast: the aft-most mast. Typically shorter than the fore-mast. ** Sections: mizzen-mast lower‚Äîmizzen topmast‚Äîmizzen topgallant mastHarland, John. Seamanship in the Age of Sail, pp. 15, 19-22, 36-37, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. . Some names given to masts in ships carrying other types of rig (where the naming is less standardised) are: * Bonaventure mizzen: the fourth mast on larger sixteenth-century galleons, typically lateen-rigged and shorter than the main mizzen. * Jigger-mast: typically, where it is the shortest, the aftmost mast on vessels with more than three masts. ** Sections: jigger-mast lower‚Äîjigger topmast‚Äîjigger topgallant mast Balclutha, shows the fore-mast, main-mast and mizzen-mast, as well as all the ship's standing and running rigging. The Balclutha is berthed in San Francisco, and is open to the public.Harland, John. Seamanship in the Age of Sail, pp. 15, 19, 36-37, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. .Parker, Dana T. Square Riggers in the United States and Canada, pp. 55, Transportation Trails, Polo, Illinois, 1994. . Most types of vessels with two masts are supposed to have a main-mast and a smaller mizzen-mast, although both brigs and two-masted schooners carry a fore-mast and a main-mast instead. On a two-masted vessel with the main-mast forward and a much smaller second mast, such as a ketch, or particularly a yawl, the terms mizzen and jigger are synonymous. Although two-masted schooners may be provided with masts of identical size, the aftmost is still referred to as the main-mast, and normally has the larger course. Schooners have been built with up to seven masts in all, with several six-masted examples. On square-rigged vessels, each mast carries several horizontal yards from which the individual sails are rigged.Harland, John. Seamanship in the Age of Sail, pp. 20-2, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. . Folding mast ships use a tabernacle anchor point. Definitions include: \\"the partly open socket or double post on the deck, into which a mast is fixed, with a pivot near the top so that the mast can be lowered\\";New Oxford American Dictionary (American English) via Apple Dictionary \\"large bracket attached firmly to the deck, to which the foot of the mast is fixed; it has two sides or cheeks and a bolt forming the pivot around which the mast is raised and lowered\\"; \\"substantial fitting for mounting the mast on deck, so that it can be lowered easily for trailering or for sailing under bridges\\", \\"hinged device allowing for the easy folding of a mast 90 degrees from perpendicular, as for transporting the boat on a trailer, or passing under a bridge\\"  History  Roman two-masted trireme, its foremast showing a typically strong forward rake In the West, the concept of a ship carrying more than one mast, to give it more speed under sail and to improve its sailing qualities, evolved in northern Mediterranean waters: The earliest foremast has been identified on an Etruscan pyxis from Caere, Italy, dating to the mid-7th century BC: a warship with a furled mainsail is engaging an enemy vessel, deploying a foresail.Turfa, J. MacIntosh; Steinmayer, A. G. (1999): \\"The Earliest Foresail, on Another Etruscan Vase\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 292‚Äì296 (295) A two-masted merchant vessel with a sizable foresail rigged on a slightly inclined foremast is depicted in an Etruscan tomb painting from 475‚Äì450 BC.Casson, Lionel (1963): \\"The Earliest Two-masted Ship\\", Archaeology, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp. 108‚Äì111 (111) An artemon (Greek for foresail) almost the same size as the galley's mainsail can be found on a Corinthian krater as early as the late 6th century BC; apart from that Greek longships are uniformly shown without it until the 4th century BC.Casson, Lionel (1980): \\"Two-masted Greek ships\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 68‚Äì69 (69) The foremast became fairly common on Roman galleys, where, inclined at an angle of 45¬∞, it was more akin to a bowsprit, and the foresail set on it, reduced in size, seems to be used rather as an aid to steering than for propulsion.Casson, Lionel (1963): \\"The Earliest Two-masted Ship\\", Archaeology, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp. 108‚Äì111 (109) While most of the ancient evidence is iconographic, the existence of foremasts can also be deduced archaeologically from slots in foremast-feets located too close to the prow for a mainsail.Beltrame, Carlo (1996): \\"Archaeological Evidence of the Foremast on Ancient Sailing Ships\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 135‚Äì139 (135) Roman merchantman (corbita) with mainmast and foremast under sail Artemon, along with mainsail and topsail, developed into the standard rig of seagoing vessels in imperial times, complemented by a mizzen on the largest freighters.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. 239‚Äì243 The earliest recorded three- masters were the giant Syracusia, a prestige object commissioned by king Hiero II of Syracuse and devised by the polymath Archimedes around 240 BC, and other Syracusan merchant ships of the time.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , p. 242, fn. 75 The imperial grain freighters travelling the routes between Alexandria and Rome also included three-masted vessels. A mosaic in Ostia (c. 200 AD) depicts a freighter with a three-masted rig entering Rome's harbour.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. XXIV, picture 145 Special craft could carry many more masts: Theophrastus (Hist. Plant. 5.8.2) records how the Romans imported Corsican timber by way of a huge raft propelled by as many as fifty masts and sails.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , p. 4, fn. 2 Renaissance three-master by Lorenzo Costa Throughout antiquity, both foresail and mizzen remained secondary in terms of canvas size, although large enough to require full running rigging. In late antiquity, the foremast lost most of its tilt, standing nearly upright on some ships. By the onset of the Early Middle Ages, rigging had undergone a fundamental transformation in Mediterranean navigation: the lateen which had long evolved on smaller Greco-Roman craft replaced the square rig, the chief sail type of the ancients, that practically disappeared from the record until the 14th century (while it remained dominant in northern Europe).Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. 243‚Äì245Pryor, John H.; Jeffreys, Elizabeth M.

Peoples, Economies and Cultures, 400‚Äì1500, Vol. 62, Brill Academic Publishers, , pp. 238f., 244 Multiple-masted sailing ships were reintroduced into the Mediterranean Sea by the Late Middle Ages. Large vessels were coming more and more into use and the need for additional masts to control these ships adequately grew with the increase in tonnage. Unlike in antiquity, the mizzen- mast was adopted on medieval two-masters earlier than the foremast, a process which can be traced back by pictorial evidence from Venice and Barcelona to the mid-14th century. To balance out the sail plan the next obvious step was to add a mast fore of the main-mast, which first appears in a Catalan ink drawing from 1409. With the three-masted ship established, propelled by square rig and lateen, and guided by the pintle-and-gudgeon rudder, all advanced ship design technology necessary for the great transoceanic voyages was in place by the beginning of the 15th century.Mott, Lawrence V. (1994): \\"A Three-masted Ship Depiction from 1409\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 39‚Äì40  Hollow masts  The first hollow mast was fitted on the American sloop Maria in 1845, long and built of staves bound with iron hoops like a barrel. Other hollow masts were made from two tapered timbers hollowed and glued together. Nearly a century later, the simple box form of mast was arrived at.  Modern masts  shrouds held apart by multiple spreaders Although sailing ships were superseded by engine-powered ships in the 19th century, recreational sailing ships and yachts continue to be designed and constructed. In the 1930s aluminum masts were introduced on large J-class yachts. An aluminum mast has considerable advantages over a wooden one: it is lighter and slimmer than a wooden one of the same strength, is impervious to rot, and can be produced as a single extruded length. During the 1960s wood was eclipsed by aluminum. Aluminum alloys, generally 6000 series, are commonly utilised.Beck, R., et al. \\"SAILING YACHT DESIGN.\\" (2009). Recently some sailing yachts (particularly home-built yachts) have begun to use steel masts. Whilst somewhat heavier than aluminum, steel has its own set of advantages. It is significantly cheaper, and a steel mast of an equivalent strength can be smaller in diameter than an aluminum mast, allowing less turbulence and a better airflow onto the sail. Illustration of modern mast and wing-mast cross-sections, with sail From the mid-1990s racing yachts introduced the use of carbon fibre and other composite materials to construct masts with even better strength-to-weight ratios. Carbon fibre masts could also be constructed with more precisely engineered aerodynamic profiles. Modern masts form the leading edge of a sail's airfoil and tend to have a teardrop-shaped cross-section. On smaller racing yachts and catamarans, the mast rotates to the optimum angle for the sail's airfoil. If the mast has a long, thin cross-section and makes up a significant area of the airfoil, it is called a wing-mast; boats using these have a smaller sail area to compensate for the larger mast area. There are many manufacturers of modern masts for sailing yachts of all sizes, a few notable companies are Hall Spars, Offshore Spars, and Southern Spars. Sails on a small ship as seen from below After the end of the age of sail, warships retained masts, initially as observation posts and to observe fall of shot, also holding fire control equipment such as rangefinders, and later as a mounting point for radar and telecommunication antennas, which need to be mounted high up to increase range. Simple pole, lattice, and tripod masts have been used‚Äîalso, on some past Japanese warships, complex pagoda masts.

It rises in western Cheshire in the hills near Peckforton Castle, very close to the source of the River Weaver. While the Weaver flows south initially, the Gowy flows north and for several miles provides the valley used by the Shropshire Union Canal. It runs just to the east of Chester and passes through a syphon under the Manchester Ship Canal to meet the Mersey near Stanlow. Its total length is around . Perennially popular with fishermen and home to several rare invertebrates, it has been polluted in its lower reaches in recent decades, due in part to the oil refinery at Stanlow and the arrival of the nearby M53 and M56 motorways, leading to schemes by environmental groups to clean up the area and to restock the fish population. One of the 'Roman' bridges at Hockenhull Platts The Gowy Meadows Nature Reserve, founded in 2002 and stretching from the A5117 to the M56, is an area of river valley peat covered with wet grassland or grazing meadows. This area of , owned by Shell UK, has been created as a nature reserve by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. Surveys by the Environment Agency show that the Gowy's eel population has held up well despite a Europe-wide massive decline in numbers. The reasons for this are unclear but local anglers suggest that eel in the river may not follow normal migration patterns because of the partially closed nature of the river flow caused by the system of syphoning under the ship canal. At one time the river provided power for up to 20 watermills. Today only a few remain: Bates Mill and Walk Mill (both in private ownership), Bunbury Mill (now owned by a Trust) and Trafford Mill. The latter is owned by United Utilities plc. Bunbury Mill is open to the public at times. Trafford Mill is being developed as a museum and an educational and training resource concentrating on conservation- related activities. The river's length has been increased over the centuries as land has been reclaimed by draining the marshes. It was on the marshes at Gibbet‚Äôs Field near Mickle Trafford that James Brown and Thomas Price were hanged in January 1795 for the abduction and robbery of a mail boy.

URL last accessed 2006-12-13. According to the Agreement, West Germany was to pay Israel for the costs of \\"resettling so great a number of uprooted and destitute Jewish refugees\\" after the war, and to compensate individual Jews, via the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, for losses in Jewish livelihood and property resulting from Nazi persecution.Agreement between the State of Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany, Bundesanzeiger Verlag  Background  In 1952, first Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion argued that the reparation demand was based on recovering as much Jewish property as possible \\"so that the murderers do not become the heirs as well\\". His other argument was that the reparations were needed to finance the absorption and rehabilitation of the Holocaust survivors in Israel. =The Claims Conference= According to the website of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, or Claims Conference, \\"In response to calls from Jewish organizations and the State of Israel, in September 1951 Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany addressed his Parliament: \\"... unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity ... The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel ... to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering.\\" One month after Adenauer's speech, Nahum Goldmann, co-chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel and president of the World Jewish Congress, convened a meeting in New York City of 23 major Jewish national and international organizations. The participants made clear that these talks were to be limited to discussion of material claims, and thus the organization that emerged from the meeting was called the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany‚Äîthe Claims Conference. The Board of Directors of the new conference consisted of groups that took part in its formation, with each member agency designating two members to the board. \\"The Claims Conference had the task of negotiating with the German government a program of indemnification for the material damages to Jewish individuals and to the Jewish people caused by Germany through the Holocaust.\\" =Israel's dilemma= Following the Holocaust Israel's relations with Germany, already extremely delicate, were further complicated by the onset of the Cold War and the division of Germany into mutually hostile eastern and western states. Due to a variety of factors, it quickly became apparent that West Germany would be the state most able and willing to deal with Israeli claims related to the Holocaust. To complicate matters further, Israel also had to be sensitive to the strategic interests of the United States which, following the breakdown in the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union, had come to believe the establishment of a prosperous West German economy was essential to forge a reliable and productive alliance with the postwar democratic government seated in Bonn. Israel was intent on taking in what remained of European Jewry. Israel was also recovering from the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and was facing a deep economic crisis which led to a policy of austerity. Unemployment was very high (especially in the ma'abarot camps) and foreign currency reserves were scarce. David Ben-Gurion and his Mapai party took a practical approach and argued that accepting the agreement was the only way to sustain the nation's economy. \\"There are two approaches\\", he told the Mapai central committee. \\"One is the ghetto Jew's approach and the other is of an independent people. I don't want to run after a German and spit in his face. I don't want to run after anybody. I want to sit here and build here. I'm not going to go to America to take part in a vigil against Adenauer.\\"  Negotiations  Negotiations were held between Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett and West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1951, Israeli authorities made a claim to the four powers occupying post-war Germany regarding compensation and reimbursement, based on the fact that Israel had absorbed and resettled 500,000 Holocaust survivors. They calculated that since absorption had cost 3,000 dollars per person ($ in today's dollars), they were owed 1.5 billion dollars ($ in today's dollars) by Germany. They also figured that six billion dollars worth of Jewish property had been pillaged by the Nazis, but stressed that the Germans could never make up for what they did with any type of material recompense. Negotiations leading to the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany began in March 1952, and were conducted between representatives of the government of the Federal Republic, the government of the State of Israel, and representatives of the World Jewish Congress, headed by Dr. Goldmann. These discussions led to a bitter controversy in Israel, as the coalition government, headed by David Ben- Gurion, claimed that reparations were necessary to restore what was stolen from the victims of the Holocaust. The agreement was signed by Adenauer and Moshe Sharett on September 10, 1952, at Luxembourg City Hall. The German Parliament (Bundestag) passed the agreement March 18, 1953, by a large majority, 239 for and 35 against, though only 106 of the ruling CDU/CSU's 214 MPs supported the motion, which relied on the unanimous support of the opposition Social Democrats to get through. The Arab League strongly opposed the motion and threatened a boycott of the Federal Republic of Germany after it passed the restitution agreement, but the plan was abandoned due to economic considerations, namely that the Arab League would suffer far more from losing trade with West Germany than West Germany would from the Arab League.1952:Germany to Pay Reparations : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO  Opposition  Public debate was among the fiercest in Israeli history. Opposition to the agreement came from both the right (Herut and the General Zionists) and the left (Mapam) of the political spectrum; both sides argued that accepting reparation payments was the equivalent of forgiving the Nazis for their crimes. On 5 November 1951, Yaakov Hazan of Mapam said in the Knesset: \\"Nazism is rearing its ugly head again in Germany, and our so-called Western 'friends' are nurturing that Nazism; they are resurrecting Nazi Germany ... Our army, the Israel Defense Forces, will be in the same camp as the Nazi army, and the Nazis will begin infiltrating here not as our most terrible enemies, but rather as our allies ...\\" At a session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in September 1952, Yitzhak Ben-Aharon, then a Mapam MK, stated, \\"I am not assuming that there are people who believe that Germany will pay a total of three billion marks, over a period of 12 years, and that this is no empty promise ... The Israeli government will obtain nothing but a piece of paper referring to three billion marks. And all this is only intended to mislead the public and claim the government has attained ...\\". =The rally= Menachem Begin protesting against the Agreement in March 1952. The sign reads: \\"Our honor shall not be sold for money; Our blood shall not be atoned by goods. We shall wipe out the disgrace!\\". Anticipating the debate in the Knesset on 7 January 1952, all adjacent roads were blocked. Roadblocks and wire fences were set up around the building and the IDF was prepared to suppress an insurrection. The rally, gathered by the agreement's opponents drew 15,000 people and the riots that ensued would be the most significant attempt in Israeli history to overturn a democratically made Knesset decision. The decision was ultimately accepted by 61‚Äì50 margin, but not before the advancing riots interrupted the plenum debate for the first time in the Knesset history. Following a passionate and dramatic speech, Menachem Begin led the protesters towards the Knesset. Begin referred to the Altalena Affair in 1948, when the IDF shelled a ship carrying arms for the Irgun by order of Ben Gurion, saying, \\"When you fired at me with cannon, I gave the order: 'Don't [return fire]!' Today I will give the order, 'Do!'\\" The demonstration turned violent as protesters began throwing stones at the building's windows while the police used force to disperse them. After five hours of rioting, the police took control of the situation using hoses and tear gas. Hundreds were arrested; about 200 protesters and 140 policemen were injured. =Further protests= The decision did not end the protests. In October 1952 Dov Shilansky was arrested near the Foreign Ministry building, carrying a pack of dynamite. In his trial, he was accused of being a member of an underground organization against the Reparations Agreement and was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Several parcel bombs were sent to Adenauer and others targets, one of which killed a policeman who handled it.Pedahzur, Ami, and Arie Perliger (2009). Jewish Terrorism in Israel. Columbia University Press. pp. 175-76 Implementation Train set manufactured by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in the old Jerusalem Railway Station, shortly after delivery as part of the reparations agreement with Germany, 1956 Despite the protests, the agreement was signed in September 1952, and West Germany paid Israel a sum of 3 billion marks over the next fourteen years; 450 million marks were paid to the World Jewish Congress. The payments were made to the State of Israel as the heir to those victims who had no surviving family. The money was invested in the country's infrastructure, and played an important role in establishing the economy of the new state. Israel at the time faced a deep economic crisis and was heavily dependent on donations by foreign Jews, and the reparations, along with these donations, would help turn Israel into an economically viable country. The reparations were paid directly to the headquarters of the Israeli purchase delegation in Cologne, which received the money from the German government in annual installments. The delegation then bought goods and shipped them to Israel, receiving its orders from a Tel Aviv-based company that had been set up to decide what to purchase and for whom. A great part of the reparations money went into purchasing equipment and raw materials for companies that were owned by the government, the Jewish Agency, and the Histadrut labor union. Notably, much of that money went into purchasing equipment for about 1,300 industrial plants; two-thirds of this money was given to 36 factories, most of them owned by the Histadrut. At the same time, hundreds of other plants, mostly privately owned ones, received minimal assistance with reparations money. From 1953 to 1963, the reparations money funded around one-third of investment in Israel's electrical system, helping it to triple its capacity, and nearly half the total investment in Israel Railways, which obtained German-made rolling stock, tracks, and signaling equipment with reparations money. The reparations were also used to purchase German-made machinery for developing the water supply, oil drilling, mining equipment for use in extracting copper from the Timna Valley mines, and heavy equipment for agriculture and construction such as combines, tractors, and trucks. About 30% of the reparations money went into buying fuel, while 17% was used to purchase ships for the Israeli merchant fleet; some fifty ships including two passenger liners were purchased, and by 1961, these vessels constituted two-thirds of the Israeli merchant marine. Funds from the reparations were also used for port development; the Port of Haifa was able to obtain new cranes, including a floating crane that was named Bar Kokhba. The Bank of Israel credited the reparations for about 15% of Israel's GNP growth and the creation of 45,000 jobs during the 12-year period they had been in effect, though the BoI report also noted that the funds received were not crucial in that Israel would have secured the funds in any case from other sources.Segev, Tom: The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust (2000, ) Yad Vashem noted that \\"in the 1990s, Jews began making claims for property stolen in Eastern Europe. Various groups also began investigating what happened to money deposited in Swiss banks by Jews outside of Switzerland who were later murdered in the Holocaust, and what happened to money deposited by various Nazis in Swiss banks. In addition, individual companies (many of them based in Germany) began to be pressured by survivor groups to compensate former forced laborers. Among them are Deutsche Bank AG, Siemens AG, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), Volkswagen AG, and Adam Opel AG. In response, early in 1999, the German government proclaimed the establishment of a fund with money from these companies to help needy Holocaust survivors. A similar fund was set up by the Swiss, as was a Hungarian fund for compensation of Holocaust victims and their heirs. At the close of the 1990s, discussions of compensation were held by insurance companies that had before the war insured Jews who were later murdered by the Nazis. These companies include Allianz, AXA, Assicurazioni Generali, Z√ºrich Financial Services Group, Winterthur, and Baloise Insurance Group. With the help of information about Holocaust victims made available by Yad Vashem, an international commission under former US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger has been trying to uncover the names of those who had been insured and were murdered in the Holocaust. The World Jewish Restitution Organization was created to organize these efforts. On behalf of US citizens, the US Foreign Claims Settlement Commission reached agreements with the German government in 1998 and 1999 to compensate Holocaust victims who immigrated to the US after the war.\\" In 1992, Dr. Brozik of the Claims Conference in Frankfurt asked the Ministry of Finance to return all property in East Germany belonging to Jews included in international treaties between Austria, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). These Jews had been paid very little compensation and Germany in 1952 had vowed never to enrich itself again like the Nazis from Jewish property. They refused; Dr. Brozik described the meeting as devastating. An Austrian citizen and her Israeli sister sued the German Government in 2000. The Berlin Court admitted that the property law was unjust / unsatisfactory towards the victims of Nazi Germany who had suffered damage but they were forced to follow the law that the Ministry of Justice had refused to amend. The sisters in question had been promised by the GDR in 1988 that they would receive $44,000 for their 15 unit apartment building in East Berlin. In 1989 they were informed they would only receive 70% as the GDR had no foreign exchange. They received $31,000. In 2000 instead of receiving $14,000 that was owed them, they received $6,000; a total of $37,000 instead of $44,000. The German Ministry of Finance sold the building in 2006 for an estimated $1.4 million making a handsome profit of 38 times more than what they had paid the two sisters. In 2019 the building was estimated to be worth $5 million. Articles were written about the case in the Sunday Express of London, Die Zeit of Hamburg, Judische Wochenzeitung of Frankfurt, Aufbau of New York and News of Austria. In conclusion the sisters were paid by the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany 2.7% of the value of their building; the German Treasury pocketed 97.3%. Also both Sabine Leutheusser Schnarenberger, the Minister of Justice and Theo Waigel, the Minister of Finance personally refused to return all Jewish property in East Germany (8 buildings in East Berlin) belonging to a total of 6 Austrian Jewish citizens. The former Minister of Justice in 2018 became a Commissioner Against Antisemitism for the State of North Rhein Westphalia. =Reopened claims= In 2007, Israeli MK Rafi Eitan made suggestions that were interpreted as a claim to reopen the agreement, although he insisted that he merely intended to \\"establish a German-Israeli work team that would examine how Germany could help the financially struggling survivors\\". Initially, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr√ºck rejected any possibility of expanding the agreement, but subsequently German government spokesman Thomas Steg said that Germany was willing to discuss the possibility of making extra pension payments to Holocaust survivors if the Israeli government makes an official request. Further claims in 2009  In 2009, Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz announced that he will demand a further ‚Ç¨450 million to ‚Ç¨1 billion in reparations from Germany on behalf of some 30,000 Israeli forced labor survivors.

In 1983, he unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. Ransom was born in Boissevain, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Alberta. He worked as a resource manager and farmer before entering public life. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1977, representing the rural riding of Souris-Killarney. In that year, Sterling Lyon's Progressive Conservatives won an upset victory over Edward Schreyer's New Democrats. Following the election, Ransom was appointed Minister of Mines, Resources and Environment. Following a reorganization of cabinet in 1979, he became Minister of Natural Resources and Chairman of the Treasury Board. In January 1981, he was promoted to Minister of Finance. Ransom did not serve long in this position, as Lyon's government fell to the NDP under Howard Pawley later in the year. Ransom, who was easily re-elected in the riding of Turtle Mountain, defeating Johannson by 3,115 votes. He ran for the party's leadership in 1983 as a representative of the party's rural/conservative wing, but was defeated on the second ballot by Gary Filmon, who was then regarded as a progressive. Subsequently, supporters of Ransom would allege that the Filmon camp encouraged third-place candidate Clayton Manness to run as a means of splitting the conservative vote. Ransom did not seek re-election in 1986. He subsequently became chairman of the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, and worked as a consultant in sustainable development.

Plot A small blue bird lands on a telephone wire and makes itself comfortable, only to have a second small bird land next to it. The two birds quickly start to squabble as others land on the wire and join in. They are interrupted when a large, gangly, awkward looking bird sitting on top of the pole honks to them. Soon, the small birds start mocking the large one by puffing up their feathers to resemble his plumage and imitating his honk. They then slide farther out along the wire and chatter suspiciously among themselves, ignoring the large bird's attempts to befriend them until he settles in the middle of all of them out on the wire. However, his weight causes the wire to sag almost to the ground and all the small birds slide down toward him, which causes him to lose his balance and flop over to hang upside down by his feet. The two nearest to the center start pecking at his toes, egged on by the rest of the crowd. One of the other birds suddenly panics, realizing how low the wire is and tries to stop the pecking. The others understand and stop too late; when the large bird's last toe slides off, the wire snaps upward and flings all the small birds out of sight like a slingshot. The large bird is so close to the ground that he's unaffected by the whole thing, but is accompanied by a shower of feathers from the small birds. One of them falls to the ground, having lost all its feathers and the large bird laughs and offers it a leaf to cover itself. The others soon tumble down as well, without feathers, and hide behind the large bird as he laughs even harder.

Touch judges also stand behind the posts to confirm that a goal has been scored following a penalty kick or conversion of a try. There are two touch judges, one for each touch-line and each holding a different coloured flag. Rugby union Rugby union touch judges support the referee by marking 'touch' (identifying when the ball leaves the playing area and comes into contact with something there or when the player carrying the ball steps out of the playing area), indicating successful kicks at goal and marking offside lines at set piece plays (the scrum and line out). Depending on the relevant national regulations, touch judges can be recognised as 'assistant referees' and can have the authority to indicate foul play, support with pre- match protocols and other roles delegated to them by the referee. In England, touch judges are only recognised as assistant referees when appointed by the RFU or by the relevant Referees' Society. Touch judges in the vast majority of community matches do not act as assistant referees and cannot comment on matters of foul play or other technical matters. In test matches, it is normal for the referee and assistant referees to be connected by a radio link to aid the communication of all this information. At elite levels of the 'sevens' variation of rugby union, additional in-goal assistant referees exist to support the referee with in-goal decisions. Rugby league In rugby league, touch judges can communicate with the referee verbally or through a number of specific flag and hand signals. These indicate specific breaches of the laws, for example forward pass, knock on and penalty offences, how play should restart and whether the ball was grounded correctly for a try. As in rugby union, touch judges stand behind the posts to confirm success of a penalty kick or the conversion of a try. Touch judge and referee signals and duties in rugby league are laid out in the laws of the game.

This alignment of eight Yersinia bacteria genomes reveals 78 locally collinear blocks conserved among all eight taxa. Each chromosome has been laid out horizontally and homologous blocks in each genome are shown as identically colored regions linked across genomes. Regions that are inverted relative to Y. pestis KIM are shifted below a genome's center axis. Comparative genomics is a field of biological research in which the genomic features of different organisms are compared. The genomic features may include the DNA sequence, genes, gene order, regulatory sequences, and other genomic structural landmarks. In this branch of genomics, whole or large parts of genomes resulting from genome projects are compared to study basic biological similarities and differences as well as evolutionary relationships between organisms. The major principle of comparative genomics is that common features of two organisms will often be encoded within the DNA that is evolutionarily conserved between them. Therefore, comparative genomic approaches start with making some form of alignment of genome sequences and looking for orthologous sequences (sequences that share a common ancestry) in the aligned genomes and checking to what extent those sequences are conserved. Based on these, genome and molecular evolution are inferred and this may in turn be put in the context of, for example, phenotypic evolution or population genetics. Virtually started as soon as the whole genomes of two organisms became available (that is, the genomes of the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium) in 1995, comparative genomics is now a standard component of the analysis of every new genome sequence. With the explosion in the number of genome projects due to the advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, particularly the next- generation sequencing methods in late 2000s, this field has become more sophisticated, making it possible to deal with many genomes in a single study. Comparative genomics has revealed high levels of similarity between closely related organisms, such as humans and chimpanzees, and, more surprisingly, similarity between seemingly distantly related organisms, such as humans and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has also showed the extreme diversity of the gene composition in different evolutionary lineages. History See also: History of genomics Comparative genomics has a root in the comparison of virus genomes in the early 1980s. For example, small RNA viruses infecting animals (picornaviruses) and those infecting plants (cowpea mosaic virus) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes. In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus that contained more than 100 genes each. The first complete genome sequence of a cellular organism, that of Haemophilus influenzae Rd, was published in 1995. The second genome sequencing paper was of the small parasitic bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium published in the same year. Starting from this paper, reports on new genomes inevitably became comparative-genomic studies. The first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called MUMMER and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms. In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti- biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the baker's yeast, was the first eukaryote to have its complete genome sequence published in 1996. After the publication of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans genome in 1998 and together with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster genome in 2000, Gerald M. Rubin and his team published a paper titled \\"Comparative Genomics of the Eukaryotes\\", in which they compared the genomes of the eukaryotes D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae, as well as the prokaryote H. influenzae. At the same time, Bonnie Berger, Eric Lander, and their team published a paper on whole-genome comparison of human and mouse. With the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including human, the Japanese pufferfish Takifugu rubripes, and mouse, precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a genome browser. Instead of undertaking their own analyses, most biologists can access these large cross- species comparisons and avoid the impracticality caused by the size of the genomes. Next-generation sequencing methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions by mapping unassembled reads against a well annotated reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains. Evolutionary principles One character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function. Similarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors‚Äô genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour (synteny), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function. Orthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions. Human right Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the proteins, RNA, and regulatory regions of different organisms to infer how selection has acted upon these elements. Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different species should be conserved through time (stabilizing selection), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent (positive selection). Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral). One of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small model organisms (for example the model Caenorhabditis elegans and closely related Caenorhabditis briggsae) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution. Methods Computational approaches to genome comparison have recently become a common research topic in computer science. A public collection of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to gene expression analysis. This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining. It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while multiple courses will begin training students to be fluent in both topics. Tools Computational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results. Visualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming. * UCSC Browser: This site contains the reference sequence and working draft assemblies for a large collection of genomes. * Ensembl: The Ensembl project produces genome databases for vertebrates and other eukaryotic species, and makes this information freely available online. * MapView: The Map Viewer provides a wide variety of genome mapping and sequencing data. * VISTA is a comprehensive suite of programs and databases for comparative analysis of genomic sequences.

The presentation of comparative data generated by VISTA can easily suit both small and large scale of data. * BlueJay Genome Browser: a stand-alone visualization tool for the multi-scale viewing of annotated genomes and other genomic elements. An advantage of using online tools is that these websites are being developed and updated constantly. There are many new settings and content can be used online to improve efficiency. Applications =Agriculture= Agriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the loci of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice landraces revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, amylose content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized. Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies. =Medicine= The medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as reverse vaccinology, researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens. Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for Group B Streptococcus, a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection. Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones. In May of 2019, using the Global Genome Set, a team in the UK and Australia sequenced thousands of globally-collected isolates of Group A Streptococcus, providing potential targets for developing a vaccine against the pathogen, also known as S. pyogenes.https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/group-streptococcus-vaccine- target-candidates-identified-global-genome-set#.XRKFu_ZFxPY =Research= Comparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods. The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six great ape species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size. Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.

Map of the municipalities that make up Lunigiana The Lunigiana () is a historical territory of Italy, which today falls within the provinces of La Spezia and Massa Carrara. Its borders derive from the ancient Roman settlement, later the medieval diocese of Luni, which no longer exists. Lunigiana, a mountainous region dissected by the Magra river, covers an area which runs from the Apennines to the Mediterranean Sea, now belongs in part to Tuscany and in part to Liguria. It takes its name from Luni, a Roman town, perhaps pre-dated by an Etruscan settlement, which became the principal urban center on the northern Tuscan coast. Some contend that the name Luni refers to the moon, a celestial body whose beauty is made all the more attractive when framed by the white-peaked Apuan Alps and high Apennine mountains. Others maintain, though little or no evidence exists, that the region was populated by those who worshiped the moon. As if to unite history and myth, the symbol of contemporary Lunigiana is a crescent moon held in the claw of a bear. The earliest recorded inhabitants of this region may have been the Apuani (from which is derived the name of the Apuan mountain chain), an ancient Ligurian people, as well as Etruscans who may have inhabited towns along the coast and even the hamlets near in-land trade routes. Curiously, while evidence of both Roman and later Medieval settlements are ample, the wondrously appealing stele, late pre-historic and Bronze Age stone statues which have been found in large numbers in this part of Tuscany, remain the symbol of this ancient land. They are the first expression of the art and, perhaps, of the religious beliefs of the peoples that inhabited northern Tuscany from the Bronze Age to start of the Roman Empire. Castles During the Middle Ages, there were 160 castles in Lunigiana, only thirty of which have reached our times in a good state of preservation; others, such as the castle of Agnino di Fivizzano, have fallen into ruin. It was in these castles that Dante found respite during his stay in Lunigiana. The historical origins of these castles date back to times when the Lombards dominated most of the Pianura Padana and, seeking an outlet on the Ligurian/Tuscan coast, they found in the Cisa Pass and the Cerreto Pass, near the town of Fivizzano, the easiest ways to cross the Apennines. During ancient times, when the settlement of Luni, founded by the Romans in 177 BC, (today a site of significant Roman ruins and a modern museum) was a flourishing city and harbour, the Romans had already built solid defensive posts along the Via Aurelia, a major road which linked up central Italy to Lunigiana and from Lunigiana to both the coastal road through Liguria and to Gaul (modern France) and across the Apennines into what is now the province of Reggio Emilia. Upon significant sections of this Roman road, the Lombards would later build the Via Francigena, for the control of which there were bloody and ferocious struggles among the local nobility, concerned with the maintenance of their dominion and fiefdoms, as well as between the states of Pisa and Lucca and, later still, between Florence, Milan and Genoa. The most important castles in Lunigiana, including La Verrucola, the famous castle of Fivizzano formerly inhabited by the late artist Pietro Cascella, and the castle of the Piagnaro in Pontremoli, the Rocca of Villafranca, the Malaspina castle in the city of Massa and the fortified village of Filetto, had been built as a result of these monumental struggles for control of Lunigiana. Moreover, when the Malaspina (one of the leading Lunigianese dynasties during the Middle Ages) played an import part in both the local politics of Lunigiana and the politics of northern Italy, they built a great number of castles, which were used as residences and fortifications by which several branches of the dynasty defended the territory. Some scholars contend that with the growth of flourishing branches of the Malaspina dynasty, the inheritance of Lunigianese feudal territories by the ever contesting large and small branches of the family eventually brought about a diminution of individual holdings causing, in the end, the parceling of fiefdoms into increasingly smaller estates, all of which needed to be protected through the building of castles and other stone fortifications. Thus, through the centuries, many large and small (now picturesque) castles were built in Lunigiana, but at the cost of weakening the overall power of the family at each generation. As a region which controls the passage from Tuscany to the northern territories of Lombardy and Parma, as well as from Tuscany to the eastern lands of Liguria and across the Apennines into Reggio Emilia, Lunigiana was fought over for centuries in countless wars which pitted the native feudal dynasties against one another. Then, in order to gain control of this strategic region, Luccans fought Pisans, Pisa struggled with Genoese, Milanese struck out against the Modense and Florentines made war on them all. While the Genoese were able to gain control of La Spezia, Lerici, Sarzana and much of the littoral coast all the way from the Cinque Terre to ancient Luni itself, the Milanese took more northern parts of Lunigiana. Meanwhile, some northeastern Lunigianese towns came under the control of either Parma or Modena. Nevertheless, the most strategic parts of ancient Lunigiana began to come under the control of the Florentine state in the early 15th century. By the second half of that century, Tuscan possession of most of Lunigiana was secured with the incorporation of Fivizzano and its vast territory into the Tuscan state. With Italian unification in the mid-nineteenth century, most of Lunigiana, though divided for centuries among the contesting duchies and city- states of northern Italy, came into the new Kingdom of Italy as part of Tuscany proper.

One of the primary factors in the promulgation of the story is that many authors quote secondary, tertiary or post-tertiary sources which have themselves misrepresented the original observations. Popularization of the effect A behavioral study was conducted in the 1950s of a troupe of Macaca fuscata (Japanese monkeys) on K≈çjima island. An unanticipated byproduct of the study was that the scientists witnessed several evolutionary behavioral changes by the troupe, two of which were orchestrated by one young female, and the others by her sibling or contemporaries. The account of only one of these behavioral changes (sweet potato washing) was propagated into a phenomenon and the story loosely published by Lawrence Blair and Lyall Watson in the mid-to-late 1970s. The story of the hundredth monkey effect was published in Lyall Watson's foreword to Lawrence Blair's Rhythms of Vision in 1975, and spread with the appearance of Watson's 1979 book Lifetide: The Biology of the Unconscious. The account is that unidentified scientists were conducting a study of macaque monkeys on the island of K≈çjima in 1952.Blair, unlike Watson, does not assign the date 1952 to the observations. These scientists observed that some of these monkeys learned to wash sweet potatoes, and gradually this new behavior spread through the younger generation of monkeys‚Äîin the usual fashion, through observation and repetition. Watson then concluded that the researchers observed that once a critical number of monkeys was reached, i.e., the hundredth monkey, this previously learned behavior instantly spread across the water to monkeys on nearby islands. This story was further popularized by Ken Keyes Jr. with the publication of his book The Hundredth Monkey. Keyes's book was about the devastating effects of nuclear war on the planet. Keyes presented the hundredth monkey effect story as an inspirational parable, applying it to human society and the effecting of positive change. Unfortunately, Keyes combined two items of truth: that the Koshima monkeys learned to wash sweet potatoes, and that the phenomenon was observed on neighboring islands. He did not provide substantiating evidence for his claims, diluting the importance of both studies and potentially discrediting the scientists involved. Combining this science with his political views may also have damaged the research credibility, leading to many reporters attempting to 'debunk' the Japanese team's research without doing sufficient research themselves. Original research The original Koshima research was undertaken by a team of scientists as a secondary consequence of 1948 research on semi-wild monkeys in Japan. The Koshima troupe was identified as segregated from other monkeys and, from 1950, used as a closed study group to observe wild Japanese monkey behavior. While studying the group the team would drop sweet potatoes and wheat on the beach and observe the troupe's behavior. In 1954 a paper was published indicating the first observances of one monkey, Imo, washing her sweet potatoes in the water. Her changed behavior led to several feeding behavior changes over the course of the next few years, all of which was of great benefit in understanding the process of teaching and learning in animal behavior. A brief account of the behavioral changes can be seen below: # The young first teach their contemporaries and immediate family, who all benefit from the new behavior and teach it to their contemporaries # If the parents or their contemporaries (or their parents) are too old, they do not adopt the behavior # Once the initial group have children, the dynamic changes from teaching previous and current generations, to the next generation learning by observation. The behavior is no longer actively taught but passively observed and mimicked # The first innovator continues to innovate. The young monkey who started potato washing also learned how to sift wheat grains out of the sand by throwing handfuls of sand and wheat into the water, then catching the wheat that floated to the top. This invention was also copied using the above teaching and learning process until there were too many monkeys on the island with too little wheat apportioned, which is when competition became too fierce and the stronger monkeys would steal the collected wheat from the weaker ones, so they stopped the learned behavior in self-preservation # The innovator‚Äôs sibling started another innovation: whereas the monkeys were initially fearful of the ocean, only deigning to put their hands and feet into it, the wheat straining innovation led to monkeys submerging more of their bodies in the water, or play-splashing in the ocean. This behavior was again copied using the above teaching and learning processes The study does not indicate a catalyst ratio at which all the Koshima monkeys started washing sweet potatoes, or a correlation to other monkey studies where similar behavior started. To the contrary, it indicated that certain age groups in Koshima would not learn the behavior. Further research Separate papers make mention that, from 1960 onward, similar sweet potato washing behaviors were noticed in other parts of the world, however this is not directly attributed to Koshima. Claims are made that a monkey swam from one island to another where he taught the resident monkeys how to wash sweet potatoes. No mention of the other behavioral improvements are made. No indication of how the monkey swam is made either - the Koshima monkeys cannot swim. Therefore, although the question must be asked how the swimming monkey learned the sweet potato washing behavior if not from Koshima, no indication is made as to where the monkey learned the behavior. In 1985, Elaine Myers re-examined the original published research in \\"The Hundredth Monkey Revisited\\" in the journal In Context. In her review she found that the original research reports by the Japan Monkey Centre in Vol. 2, 5, and 6 of the journal Primates are insufficient to support Watson's story. In short, she is suspicious of the existence of a hundredth monkey phenomenon; the published articles describe how the sweet potato washing behavior gradually spread through the monkey troupe and became part of the set of learned behaviors of young monkeys, but Myers does not agree that it serves as evidence for the existence of a critical number at which the idea suddenly spread to other islands. The story as told by Watson and Keyes is popular among New Age authors and personal growth gurus and has become an urban legend and part of New Age mythology. Also, Rupert Sheldrake has cited that a phenomenon like the hundredth monkey effect would be evidence of morphic fields bringing about non-local effects in consciousness and learning. As a result, the story has also become a favorite target of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, and was used as the title essay in The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal, published by the Committee in 1990. In his 1997 book Why People Believe Weird Things, Michael Shermer explains how the urban legend started, was popularized, and has been discredited. The original research continues to prove useful in the study of cultural transmission in animals. An analysis of the appropriate literature by Ron Amundson, published by The Skeptics Society, revealed several key points that demystified the supposed effect. Unsubstantiated claims that there was a sudden and remarkable increase in the proportion of washers in the first population were exaggerations of a much slower, more mundane effect. Rather than all monkeys mysteriously learning the skill it was noted that it was predominantly a learned skill, which is widespread in the animal kingdom; older monkeys who did not know how to wash tended not to learn. As the older monkeys died and younger monkeys were born the proportion of washers naturally increased. The time span between observations by the Japanese scientists was on the order of years so the increase in the proportion was not observed to be sudden. Claims that the practice spread suddenly to other isolated populations of monkeys may be called into question given the fact that the monkeys had the researchers in common. Amundson also notes that the sweet potato was not available to the monkeys prior to human intervention. The number of monkeys in the colony was counted as 59 in 1962 indicating that even in numbers no \\"hundredth monkey\\" existed.

The story is told from various perspectives of members of both the nameless organisation investigating the farm and plotting against each other, as well as Hellstrom and several high ranking hive members collectively dealing with the threat of being discovered and probably extinguished by ‚Äöthe wild ones‚Äò. In the end the hive's weapon project is ready to protect the hive and the upcoming 'swarming' - the gradual displacement of individual based humanity. Inspiration David L. Wolper's quasi-documentary film The Hellstrom Chronicle, released in 1971, was the inspiration for Herbert's novel. In an interview with Tim O'Reilly, Herbert stated: \\"I said, 'In terms of what we want now, as we think of our world now, what would be the most horrible kind of civilization you could imagine?' And then I said, 'Now I will make... [the members of that civilization] the heroes of the story, by taking negative elements of the surrounding society and treating them as the villain.' That creates a very peculiar kind of tension.\\" Reception David Pringle gave Hellstrom's Hive three stars out of four and called it \\"a powerful novel\\". Awards In 1978 Hellstrom's Hive won the Prix Tour-Apollo Award for best science fiction novel published in French.

He notably served as Home Secretary from 1895 to 1900. Background and education Ridley was born in London, the eldest son of Sir Matthew White Ridley, 4th Baronet and his wife the Hon. Cecilia Anne, daughter of James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale and his wife Cecilia Arabella Frances Barlow. He was educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1865, he was a Fellow of All Souls for nine years. Political career In 1868, he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Northumberland North, and held this seat until the 1885 general election, when he was defeated in his attempt to stand for the new seat of Hexham. At the 1886 general election he contested Newcastle-upon-Tyne, again unsuccessfully, but returned to Parliament in an 1886 by-election at Blackpool. Having been Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department for two years in Disraeli's administration, Sir Matthew Ridley (as he became when he succeeded his father as fifth baronet in 1877) was Financial Secretary to the Treasury in Lord Salisbury's interim government of 1885 to 1886. In 1895, after the fall of Lord Rosebery's ministry, and having already failed in April of that year to be elected Speaker of the House of Commons, Ridley became Home Secretary, and held this post until his retirement in 1900. He was that same year created Viscount Ridley and Baron Wensleydale, of Blagdon and Blyth in the County of Northumberland. Family Lord Ridley married Mary Georgiana Marjoribanks (1850 ‚Äì 14 March 1909), daughter of The 1st Baron Tweedmouth and his wife, Isabella Weir-Hogg, on 10 December 1873.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1995. In 1983, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. The son of Sidney Alfred Manness and Helen Julia Kosier, he was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He worked as a farmer before entering public life. In 1968, he married Cheryl Louise Reinsch. Manness served as President of the provincial Progressive Conservative Association in the early 1970s, and supported Sterling Lyon over Sidney Spivak in the divisive leadership challenge of 1975. Manness was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1981, easily defeating Peter Francis of the New Democratic Party in the rural riding of Morris. Two years later, he ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative party against Gary Filmon and Brian Ransom. Manness was regarded as the most right-wing of the three candidates. After he was eliminated on the first ballot, however, his supporters divided almost evenly between the more conservative Ransom and the more progressive Filmon. Subsequently, Ransom's supporters would allege that Filmon's team had encouraged Manness to run as a means of splitting the right-wing vote. Manness was re-elected without difficulty in 1986, 1988 and 1990. When Filmon's Tories formed government in 1988, he was appointed Minister of Finance and Government House Leader. Following a 1993 cabinet shuffle, he became Minister of Education and Training. In this capacity, he presided over a re-evaluation of funding methods for the public system which resulted in government cutbacks. Manness did not run for re-election in 1995. He later became co-President of the Canadian Alliance, and attempted to keep the party united during the controversies over Stockwell Day's leadership in 2002. In 2004, he campaigned for the Conservative Party of Canada. Manness has also formed an organization called \\"Prairie Pulp and Paper Co.\\" with actor Woody Harrelson, promoting the development of an environmentally friendly, non-wood-based pulp program in the province.

In addition he was a philanthropist, giving to his alma mater, Cornell University, and a number of other causes. Early life and career Taylor was born in Lyons, New York, to William Delling Taylor and Mary (n√©e Underhill) Taylor. His father owned and operated a tannery business. Taylor graduated from the Cornell Law School of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1894. He returned to Lyons and for the next five years attempted to establish a small-town law practice. He also twice ran for the New York State Assembly as a Democrat, and both times was defeated. In 1900, Taylor left Lyons to join his brother Willard Underhill Taylor (Cornell, A.B., class of 1891) on Wall Street in New York City, New York. His focus turned to corporate law, practicing at the firm of DeForest Brothers & DeForest. Taylor handled litigation for his father's tannery and subsequently won a U.S. government contract for mail pouches and related products. He moved into the textile and mail delivery business and, according to the Finger Lakes Times, invented the transparent \\"window\\" in envelopes through which an address is displayed. Taylor's efforts in the textile industry expanded to the cotton markets, identifying opportunities to acquire struggling cotton mills, reworking labor practices and updating the technology they used. This approach later became known as the \\"Taylor Formula.\\" Seeing the potential of the infant automotive industry, he established a textile firm that became the leading supplier of combined tire fabric. During World War I his plants became the leading suppliers to the American military effort. Following the war he saw a boom-bust cycle coming and disposed of all his interests in the mills. U.S. Steel With his now-sizable fortune he could have retired, but at the urging of two leading Wall Street bankers (J. P. Morgan, Jr. and George F. Baker), Taylor was recruited to help turn around the finances of U.S. Steel. It was once the largest steel producer and largest corporation in the world. On September 15, 1925, he was elected a director and member of its powerful finance committee. He became the committee's chairman in 1929. From March 29, 1932, until April 5, 1938, he was U.S. Steel's chairman and chief executive officer. During the desperate years of the Great Depression, he applied the Taylor Formula again‚Äîclosing or selling plants; reorganizing the corporate structure; and upgrading and modernizing the company's operations and technology. One defining moment occurred in 1937, when Taylor struck a deal with labor leader John L. Lewis who, at the time, was head of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Through the deal, U.S. Steel agreed to recognize a CIO subsidiary for purposes of representing and organizing U.S. Steel workers. U.S. Steel became the first major industrial corporation to take this historic step. The basis for the deal later became known as the Myron Taylor Labor Formula, defining how to bring about labor stability and long-term prosperity for the company: > The Company recognizes the right of its employees to bargain collectively > through representatives freely chosen by them without dictation, coercion or > intimidation in any form or from any source. It will negotiate and contract > with the representatives of any group of its employees so chosen and with > any organization as the representative of its members, subject to the > recognition of the principle that the right to work is not dependent on > membership or non-membership in any organization and subject to the right of > every employee freely to bargain in such manner and through such > representatives, if any, as he chooses Taylor soon was featured on the covers of or in articles in Time,Cover - Volume XIII, Number 16, April 22, 1929, Time magazine.

He did not officially retire from the board until January 12, 1956. U.S. Steel named one of its new lake freighters the Myron C. Taylor in 1929. It sailed under this name until it was sold off in 2000. Diplomat =International affairs= Myron Taylor addresses the √âvian Conference Taylor's former residence in Washington, D.C. In July 1938 he represented the U.S. at the √âvian Conference, in √âvian-les-Bains, France, convened at the initiative of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss the issue of increasing numbers of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution leading up to the onset of World War II. Before German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler turned to mass extermination of Jews by way of The Holocaust, the possibility of having refugees sent to willing countries was posed. Sumner Welles, the U.S. Under Secretary of State had proposed an international conference to address the immigration issue. Going into the conference Roosevelt gave Taylor the instruction: \\"All you need to do is get these people together.\\" Taylor was appointed chairman, and while he was not able to get concessions on immigration, a proposal to create the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees was approved. =Personal envoy to Pope Pius XII= On December 22, 1939, Roosevelt asked Taylor \\"to take on a special mission for me\\" ‚Äî to be Roosevelt's \\"personal envoy\\" to Pope Pius XII. Taylor's appointment was announced on December 23, 1939 and confirmed in Rome, Italy, on February 28, 1940.Camile M. Cianfarra. December 20, 1949. \\"Taylor to Resign Vatican Post Soon\\".

Initially he was ordered to work to prevent Italy from joining the war with Germany. Later he would be influential in urging limited bombing of Rome in 1943‚Äì1944 by the Allies of World War II, and then only of specific military targets, in order to preserve the cultural resources of the ancient city. Harold J. Tittmann, Jr. remained as charg√© d'affaires after Taylor's departure. Given the rising tensions, he was required to move into Vatican City on December 13, 1941, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the US entered World War II against the Axis Powers.The New York Times. December 14, 1941. \\"U.S. Envoy in Vatican\\". p. 8. Taylor returned to Rome in September 1942, but went back to the US in October of that year.The New York Times.

In the summer of 1942, Taylor was asked to convey to the Pope that the US would win the war and there would be no peace without victory. He persuaded the Pope to speak out against the atrocities being perpetuated by the Nazis against the Jews. Taylor was also successful in persuading Spain's military general and dictator Francisco Franco not to join the Axis powers of World War II. Later, he was able to lobby for an Allied military airbase in neutral Portugal that was ultimately granted. As the war approached its end and afterwards, Taylor recognized the Italian people were in dire need of necessities. He established American Relief for Italy, an organization that became the primary means to provide food, clothing and medicine to millions of suffering Italians. In a short time approximately $6 million in public funds were raised and over $37 million in relief supplies were distributed. Taylor intended to step down after the war ended. Following Roosevelt's death, he agreed to stay on and to help President Harry S. Truman, who succeeded to office. Truman charged Taylor to work \\"not only with the Pope but with other leaders in the spiritual world and in the world of politics and secular affairs as he travels through Europe in the fulfillment of his mission.\\" For the next four years, Taylor traveled throughout Europe to get helpful Cold War information to which no other westerner had access and to shore up opposition by the Church to the Soviet Union. Taylor resigned in January 1950. Truman recalled his assistant Franklin C. Gowan, prompting speculation that the U.S. would reduce its relations with the Vatican and its officials. Protestant leaders continued to oppose US relations with the Vatican.Camile M. Cianfarra. January 20, 1950. \\"Truman Recalls Gowan, Taylor's Assistant; Possible End to U.S. Ties Disturbs Vatican\\". The New York Times. p. 12. Although there were interim informal diplomacy assignments, the U.S. did not appoint an official U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See until 1984. Awards On December 20, 1948, President Truman awarded Taylor the Medal for Merit ‚Äî one of the highest civilian decoration of the U.S. awarded to civilians for exceptionally meritorious conduct. He was also named a Knight of the Order of Pius IX, First Degree. In 1929 a lake freighter operated by a subsidiary of US Steel was named the Myron C. Taylor in his honor. Retirement In early 1950 Taylor officially retired. His country home in Locust Valley, New York, was situated on the site of a farm started by an English colonial ancestor, Captain John Underhill.\\"Myron Taylor Dies; Ex-Envoy to Vatican\\". The New York Times. May 7, 1959. After the Underhill house was damaged in a fire, Taylor did not tear it down. Instead, he encased it in a new fa√ßade designed by the architect Harrie T. Lindeberg. Taylor took an active interest in Underhill ‚Äî placing a marker at the entrance to the Underhill Burying Ground in 1953 and creating an endowment to assist with the perpetual maintenance. The marker reads: \\"Erected by Myron C. Taylor in honor of his mother Mary Morgan Underhill Taylor, 1953\\". Philanthropy and charitable activity Myron Taylor Hall at Cornell Law School Taylor gave $1.5 million in 1928 to Cornell University for the construction of a new building complex for its Cornell Law School and Law Library. The new space allowed the library five floors of stacks for over 200,000 volumes. The dedication was in the Moot Court Room on October 15, 1932, with a buffet luncheon in the Reading Room following. Taylor and his wife Anabel C. Taylor presented the keys to the hall to then-Cornell University President Livingston Farrand.Who Was Myron Taylor? and, Who Was Charles Evans Hughes?, The Tower, December 5, 1996 Among his last-remaining projects after his retirement was overseeing his 1949 gift to Cornell to build a $1.5 million structure adjoining its law school (which he had also helped to build). The new building, Anabel Taylor Hall, was named in his wife's honor and built to serve as an interdenominational religious center. Funds from Taylor also went toward the establishment of the Myron Taylor Lectures on Foreign Affairs, and for the Charles Evans Hughes residence center. Myron and Anabel Taylor contributed several items to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, or owned artwork that was later given by another collector. Among these items include: * a statuette of the god Anubis as embalmer, Ptolemaic Period, c. 332-30 BC (given by Mr. and Mrs. Myron Taylor in 1938) * Bouquet of Chrysanthemums, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1881 (purchased by Taylor by 1937, sold in 1961 to Annenberg, bequest to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2002). Death Taylor quietly lived out his final years, never seeking public accolades or recognition. When his wife died on December 12, 1958, he lost his raison d'etre. He died five months later on May 5, 1959, at his home in New York City at age 85. Truman paid tribute noting, \\"The Honorable Myron C. Taylor performed great services for both me and my predecessor in the White House to the Vatican at a time when it was essential that the United States be represented in that quarter. Undoubtedly, no one could have performed the job as well as he did ... All of this should be deeply grateful for the unselfish works of this fine man and able public servant.\\" Leaders in government, finance and industry were among the 200 people who attended the funeral service at his home on 16 East Seventieth Street. Honorary pallbearers included Welles; Deane Waldo Malott, president of Cornell University; Roger M. Blough, chairman of U.S. Steel; and Benjamin F. Fairless and Irving S. Olds, former chairmen of U.S. Steel. Four clergymen, led by the Right Rev. Horace Donegan, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New York, participated in the service held in the music room of the residence.

As a medication it is used to break down clots in some cases of myocardial infarction (heart attack), pulmonary embolism, and arterial thromboembolism. The type of heart attack it is used in is an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is given by injection into a vein. Side effects include nausea, bleeding, low blood pressure, and allergic reactions. A second use in a person's lifetime is not recommended. While no harm has been found with use in pregnancy, it has not been well studied in this group. Streptokinase is in the antithrombotic family of medications and works by turning on the fibrinolytic system. Streptokinase was discovered in 1933 from beta-hemolytic streptococci. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is no longer commercially available in the United States. Medical uses If percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not available within 90‚Äì120 minutes of first contact, streptokinase is recommended intravenously as soon as possible after the onset of a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). As streptokinase is a bacterial product, the body has the ability to build up an immunity to it. Therefore, it is recommended that this medication should not be used again after four days from the first administration, as it may not be as effective and can also cause an allergic reaction. For this reason, it is usually given only for a person's first heart attack. Further thrombotic events could be treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Overdose of streptokinase or tPA can be treated with aminocaproic acid. Contraindications =Absolute= * Any prior intracranial hemorrhage * Known structural cerebral vascular lesion (e.g., arteriovenous malformation) * Known cancer inside the skull (primary or metastatic) * Ischemic stroke more than 4.5 hours and less than 3 months ago * Suspected aortic dissection * Active bleeding or bleeding problem other than menstruation * Significant closed-head or facial trauma within 3 months * Intracranial or intraspinal surgery within 2 months * Severe uncontrolled high blood pressure (unresponsive to emergency therapy) * For streptokinase, prior treatment within the previous 6 months =Relative= * History of chronic, severe, poorly controlled hypertension * Significant hypertension on presentation (SBP >180 mm Hg or DBP >110 mm Hg) * History of prior ischemic stroke more than 3 month ago * Dementia * Known intracranial pathology not covered in absolute contraindications * Traumatic or prolonged (>10 min) CPR * Major surgery less than three weeks ago * Recent (within 2 to 4 wk) internal bleeding * Noncompressible vascular punctures * Active peptic ulcer * Oral anticoagulant therapy Mechanism of action Proposed counterion for Asp740 is Lys698 create salt-bridge Substrate Enzyme Mechanism Movie Streptokinase belongs to a group of medications known as fibrinolytics, and complexes of streptokinase with human plasminogen can hydrolytically activate other unbound plasminogen by activating through bond cleavage to produce plasmin. There are three domains to streptokinase, denoted Œ± (residues 1‚Äì150), Œ≤ (residues 151‚Äì287), and Œ≥ (residues 288‚Äì414). Each domain binds plasminogen, although none can activate plasminogen independently. Plasmin is produced in the blood to break down fibrin, the major constituent of blood thrombi, thereby dissolving clots once they have fulfilled their purpose of stopping bleeding. Extra production of plasmin caused by streptokinase breaks down unwanted blood clots, for example, in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). The usual activation of plasminogen is by proteolysis of the Arg561‚ÄîVal562 bond. The amino group of Val562 then forms a salt-bridge with Asp740, which triggers a conformational change producing the active protease plasmin. When streptokinase is present, it binds to plasminogen to form a complex (streptokinase¬∑plasminogen) that converts substrate plasminogen to plasmin. Residues 1‚Äì59 of streptokinase regulate its capacity to induce an active site in bound plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism and to activate substrate plasminogen in a fibrin- independent manner. This complex subsequently rearranges to an active complex although the Arg561‚ÄìVal562 bond remains intact. Therefore, another residue must substitute for the free amino group of Val562 and provide a counterion for Asp740 in this active complex. Two candidates for this counterion have been suggested: Ile1 of streptokinase and Lys698 of plasminogen. Deletion of Ile1 of streptokinase markedly inhibits its capacity to induce an active site in plasminogen, which supports the hypothesis that establishment of a salt bridge between Ile1 of streptokinase and Asp740 of plasminogen is necessary for streptokinase to induce an active site in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism. In contrast with the Ile1 substitutions, the Lys698 mutations also decreased the dissociation constant of the streptokinase complex by 15 to 50 fold. These observations suggest that Lys698 is involved in formation of the initial streptokinase¬∑plasminogen complex. =Biology= Streptokinase is naturally produced by Streptococci spp. bacteria, which use this enzyme to break up blood clots so that they can spread from the initial site of infection. It can also activate fibrin. It is similar, both in function and in structure, to staphylokinase (Sak) found in Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylokinase is considered a virulence factor, although its presence after the establishment of infection actually decreases disease severity. Both enzymes are carried by phages. History After many years of work along with his student Sol Sherry, William S. Tillett discovered streptokinase in 1933. Initially used in treatment of fibrinous pleural exudates, hemothorax and tuberculous meningitis, its role in acute myocardial infarction was serendipitous. Research Streptokinase may find a use in helping to prevent postoperative adhesions, a common complication of surgery, especially abdominal surgery (appendectomy, gall stones, hysterectomy, etc.) One study using animal models (rats) found that when used with a PHBV membrane drug- delivery system, it was 90 percent effective in preventing adhesions. However, it has not been shown to be effective in humans in a clinical trial. Marketing It is marketed in Chile as Streptase by Alpes Selection, under license of CSL Behring Germany.

Born and raised in Tennessee and St. Louis, Missouri, he wrote frequently about the urban South in his stories and novels. Biography Taylor was born in Trenton, Tennessee, to Matthew Hillsman \\"Red\\" Taylor, a prominent attorney who played football at Vanderbilt University in 1904 and '05, and Katherine Baird (Taylor) Taylor. His father was named after Matthew Hillsman, a long-time local Baptist pastor. His father's father, Colonel Robert Zachary Taylor, had fought for the Confederate Army as a private under Nathan Bedford Forrest. When working in 1908 as an attorney for the West Tennessee Land Company, which had bought interests in property at Reelfoot Lake, he was kidnapped with attorney Quentin Rankin in October and shot by night riders, who were harassing and intimidating people associated with the company. Initially reported as killed, Taylor escaped by swimming across the lake. Rankin was shot and hanged the same night. His mother's father was Robert Love Taylor, a politician and writer from eastern Tennessee who served one term as a US Congressman, and three two-year terms as governor of Tennessee in the 19th century, and as United States Senator from Tennessee from 1907 until his death in 1912. During his early childhood, Taylor lived with his family in Nashville. The family moved to St. Louis in 1926 when Taylor's father became president of the General American Life Insurance Company. In St. Louis, Taylor attended the Rossman School and St. Louis Country Day School. In 1932, the family moved to Memphis, where his father established a law practice. Taylor graduated from Central High School in Memphis in 1935. He wrote his first published piece while there, an interview with actress Katharine Cornell. After a gap year in which he traveled to England, Taylor enrolled at Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College) in 1936, studying under the critic Allen Tate. Tate encouraged Taylor to transfer to Vanderbilt University, which he later left to continue studying with the great American critic and poet John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Poet Robert Lowell from Boston was also enrolled there and they became lifelong friends. Taylor also befriended Robert Penn Warren, Randall Jarrell, Katherine Anne Porter, Jean Stafford, James Thackara, Robie Macauley and other significant literary figures of the time. Considered to be one of the finest American short story writers, Taylor made his fictional milieu the urban South, with references to its history. His characters, usually middle or upper-class people, often are living in a time of change in the 20th century, and struggle to discover and define their roles in society. His collection The Old Forest and Other Stories (1985) won the PEN/Faulkner Award. Taylor also wrote three novels, including A Summons to Memphis in 1986, for which he won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and In the Tennessee Country in 1994. Taylor taught literature and writing at Kenyon and at the University of Virginia. He was married for fifty-one years to the poet Eleanor Ross Taylor and died in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1994.

He was Commissioner of the Northwest Territories from July 12, 1963 to January 16, 1967. He was the last non-resident Commissioner of the NWT. Bent Gestur \\"Ben\\" Sivertz was born one of six brothers in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. His parents were Icelandic immigrants and he and his brothers were raised in Victoria, B.C. where his father Christian was a longtime letter carrier and an early labour organizer in the post office. Bent was a merchant seaman and sailed in square-rigged ships for ten years on the B.C. coast and to Australia and New Zealand. He later crewed on tugboats such as the Moresby and Salvage King while taking teacher training at U.B.C. As an officer in the R.C.N.V.R., he was called up in 1940 for service with the Royal Canadian Navy and after instructing in navigation at several locations in Canada, in 1944 became commanding officer of HMCS Kings, as the Officer Training Establishment was then called. II. After World War II, Bent Sivertz entered the Department of External Affairs where his success in reorganizing and streamlining the Passport Office to a point where passports were issued in three days rather than the previous three weeks, led to him being drafted in 1950 into the new Department of Resources and Development. Sivertz initiated a number of progressive and innovative policies in northern healthcare, education, infrastructure and corrections. His memoir recounts some of these activities and his struggles with Arthur Laing the then Minister of Northern Affairs. Sivertz became Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1963 and served until 1967. During the 1950s he was instrumental in introducing print making and cooperative marketing to the Cape Dorset Inuit. \\"Today my tenure in Arctic Canada, and that of my colleagues is often referred to by the new breed of historians and politicians, as \\"assimilationist\\". They are quick to say that we were \\"well-intentioned, but misguided.\\" I am told that I must not take personally the very personal attacks that have been leveled against me in the name of progress, but simply to understand that my notion of right and wrong was different from that of today. This has been a sadness for me and many of my northern peers who devoted themselves to Canada's North. In 1993, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples formalized this attack and destroyed many reputations, while turning history into a black and white affair, casting the white government employees as the 'bad guy', and the northern people, the Inui, [as] the exploited innocents. In spite of my difficulty with this Commission and my shabby treatment at its hands, my experiences in northern work have not been diminished where personal recollection is concerned.\\" Bent \\"Ben\\" Sivertz's oldest brother Henry George was a teacher until his enlistment in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Henry was one of thirty-six Canadians awarded the Military Medal and two bars during World War I. He was killed in action in September 1918 at the (second) Battle of Cambrai. He is commemorated in the former Provincial Normal School (for teachers), of which he was a graduate, now part of Camosun College, Victoria, B.C. The next oldest brother Gustave \\"Gus\\" Sivertz also served in the C.E.F. and was later a well-known journalist in Vancouver where he wrote a periodic column called \\"Memoirs of an Old Sweat\\" about the War and veterans concerns. Christian \\"Chris\\" Sivertz, was also a teacher when he volunteered with his brothers in July 1916. All three brothers served in infantry battalions on the Western Front, Gus being wounded. Bent Gestur Sivertz died on Mayne Island, BC in 2000. His wife, Barbara Isabel (n√©e Prael) Sivertz predeceased him in Victoria, B.C. in 1995.

She met Jefferson Davis (1808‚Äì1889), when living with her father and family at Fort Crawford during the Black Hawk War in 1832. They married in 1835 and she died three months later of malaria. Marriage and death Margaret Mackall (n√©e Smith) and Zachary Taylor had three surviving daughters and one son. Sarah Knox Taylor was their second child and spent some years growing up on military installations. Her father became a general and commanded forts; her mother provided most of her education. Sarah was given the nickname \\"Knoxie,\\" which originated from her middle name and from Fort Knox II in Vincennes, Indiana, where she was born. In the early 1830s, her father commanded Fort Crawford at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and was involved in waging the Black Hawk War. His wife and children lived there with him. At age 17, Sarah fell in love with Jefferson Davis, (1808‚Äì1889), a recent graduate of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York and a newly commissioned lieutenant in the United States Army, who was second to General Taylor at the fort. Davis was transferred to St. Louis in 1833, yet managed to keep in contact with the woman whom he wished to marry. Zachary Taylor admired Davis for his soldiering skills but opposed the romantic match. The Taylors' older daughter had already married Army surgeon Robert Crooke Wood, and they were raising three young children in a desolate frontier outpost. Together with their own experience, the Taylors felt that the military life was too hard and did not want Sarah to be an Army wife.Cooper 2000, p. 65. After discussions with his older brother Joseph Emory Davis, Jefferson decided to resign from the Army so that he could marry Sarah. He returned to Mississippi to develop his Brierfield Plantation next to his brother's Hurricane Plantation. Joseph gave Jefferson the land, called Brierfield because it was largely covered with brush and briers.Cooper 2000, pp. 75‚Äì79. After Sarah turned 21, she married Davis on June 17, 1835 at the home of her aunt, near Louisville, Kentucky.Davis 1996, pp. 69, 72. Both of the newlyweds contracted either malaria or yellow fever on a summer visit to Davis's sister, Anna Davis Smith, in St. Francisville, Louisiana. Sarah Taylor Davis died of the tropical illness just three months into her marriage to Jefferson Davis, while staying in her sister-in-law's home, Locust Grove Plantation. Her husband nearly died as well.Davis 1996, 74‚Äì75. The young Mrs. Davis was laid to rest near other members of Jefferson Davis's family, in the cemetery located on the site of the (former) Locust Grove Plantation. The cemetery has been preserved by the state of Louisiana and is now known as the Locust Grove State Historic Site. Posthumous Jefferson Davis was devastated by the death of his young wife, as were her parents. Her death caused years of ill will between Davis and Zachary Taylor; Taylor and his wife felt that Davis should have known better than to go to St. Francisville in the \\"fever season\\". The men met by chance in 1845 on a Mississippi steamboat and achieved some reconciliation. After recovering from malaria, seeking respite from the loss of his wife, Davis sailed to Havana, and then to New York City. In 1836, he returned to his Brierfield Plantation in Warren County, Mississippi, to take up cotton cultivation. After being reclusive for years, he gradually became active in politics. He remarried in 1845 and had six children. He served in Congress and was elected as President of the Confederate States of America, after secession in 1861. When Jefferson Davis married Varina Banks Howell on February 26, 1845, he insisted that the newlywed couple visit Sarah's grave during their honeymoon. Davis served as Colonel under the command of General Zachary Taylor in the 1847 Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The city of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, designated March 6, 2013, as Sarah Knox Taylor Day. References * The North Carolina Booklet, Oct. 1920, Jan. ‚Äì Apr. 1921, vol.

Early life Born in Brunswick County, Virginia, Tazewell was the son of Littleton and Mary Gray Tazewell. He attended the rural schools and graduated from the College of William and Mary at Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1770. He married Dorothea Elizabeth Waller on January 13, 1774, who were the parents of Littleton Waller Tazewell, who became a senator and governor of Virginia, and a daughter, Sophia Ann. Career Tazewell studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1773, and began his practice. During the American Revolutionary War, he raised and was commissioned captain of a troop of cavalry. A member of the House of Burgesses in 1775, Tazewell was also a delegate to the Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776, which wrote the state constitution. From 1778 to 1785, he was a member of the Virginia General Assembly. In 1785, Tazewell became a judge of the Virginia General Court. Elevated to its chief justice, he served from 1789 to 1793.

It rises at Irwell Springs on Deerplay Moor, approximately north of Bacup and flows southwards for to meet the Mersey near Irlam. The Irwell marks the boundary between Manchester and Salford, and its lower reaches have been canalised and now form part of the Manchester Ship Canal. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irwell's lower reaches were a trading route that became part of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. In the 19th century, the river's course downstream of Manchester was permanently altered by the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which opened in 1896. The canal turned Manchester and Salford into a major inland seaport and led to the development of Trafford Park which became the largest industrial estate in Europe. Further changes were made in the 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in Manchester and Salford, including the construction of the Anaconda Cut in 1970 and the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme in 2014. The river became severely polluted by industrial waste in the Industrial Revolution, but in the second half of the 20th century a number of initiatives were implemented to improve water quality, restock it with fish and create a diverse environment for wildlife. Stretches of the river flowing through Manchester and Salford have attracted large-scale investment in business and residential developments, such as Salford Quays, and other parts have become important wildlife havens. The Irwell is used for recreational activities, such as pleasure cruising, rowing, racing, swimming and fishing. Course From its source to the confluence with the River Mersey the Irwell is about long. Rising on the moors above Cliviger, it flows south through Bacup, Rawtenstall, Ramsbottom and Bury before merging with the River Roch near Radcliffe. Turning west, it joins the River Croal near Farnworth before turning southeast through Kearsley, Clifton and the Agecroft area of Pendlebury. It then meanders around Lower Kersal and Lower Broughton. It bisects Salford and Manchester, joining the rivers Irk and Medlock, and then turns west toward Irlam, as part of the Manchester Ship Canal. Its course ends just east of Irlam, where it empties into the Mersey. Natural history Grey heron wading in the Irwell near Bury. Until the early 19th century the Irwell was well stocked with fish and other wildlife, with people living near Manchester Cathedral using its water for drinking and other domestic purposes. However, during the Industrial Revolution, increasing levels of pollution caused by waste products discharged into the river by local industries proved fatal to wildlife, with fish stocks disappearing completely by about 1850. This situation abated somewhat during the 20th century, with a slow improvement in water quality leading to fresh populations of roach, bream and chub, and sightings of brown trout have become increasingly common. Problems with water quality in some of the former Manchester Docks basins became apparent with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality to such an extent that the number of invertebrate species present increased to more than 30, including freshwater shrimp. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England. Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are located close to the banks of the Irwell, near to its confluence with the River Croal at Moses Gate Country Park near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, an 88 800 m¬≤ site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on the predominance of flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton Country Park and Kersal Dale Country Park, both of which have been designated as LNRs. Grey herons, cormorants, mute swans, kingfishers and many species of geese and ducks are regularly sighted on the river.Bullock, R The Salford Trail Retrieved on 23 October 2008 The Manchester Ship Canal near Salford Quays is one of the top ten sites in Britain for diving ducks, providing a winter home to approximately 3,000 common pochard and 2,000 tufted ducks. Geology New Red Sandstone at Clifton The Irwell is all that remains of the shallow seas that covered most of south-east Lancashire in the Late Carboniferous period, when deposits of mud and sand were laid down. During the Permian and Triassic periods, red sandstones were deposited under arid, desert conditions and these became compressed into beds of shales, New Red Sandstone and Manchester marls, alternating with layers of gritstone. The glaciers of the Pleistocene period radically re-shaped the landscape and then retreated, leaving behind deposits of sand, pebbles and boulder clay that formed the fluvioglacial ridges of the lower Irwell Valley. Ashclough, a site which comprises the steep banks of the river between Prestolee and Little Lever, has been designated an SSSI because of its geological interest, primarily because it is the best site in the area displaying the Ashclough marine band and its associated strata. Ashclough is a site of national importance for interpreting the coal measure palaeogeography of Great Britain. River Irwell catchment area The River Irwell catchment area extends from the moors above Bacup to the Manchester Ship Canal. The climate of the catchment area is wetter than the UK average, with rainfall of per annum compared to per annum, and the rivers quickly respond to rainfall. The topography varies considerably, with the upper reaches dominated by the Pennine moors at an altitude of between AODAbove Ordnance Datum (mean sea level) and the bottom of the catchment consisting of relatively flat land, which lies between AOD. The watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys, which contributes to high rates of run-off, as does the underlying solid geology. This comprises Lower Coal Measures overlying Millstone Grit, both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water. The Millstone Grit is, in turn, underlain by limestone rocks from the lower Carboniferous period. The surface deposits comprise thick peat in the upper reaches, with glacial boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel in the lower parts. The sand and gravel are also classified as a minor aquifer, whilst the boulder clay is a non-aquifer. The higher, steeper slopes of the upper part of the catchment provide a large source of erodible material and debris which is transported downstream to the lower, flatter parts of the catchment. Where the channel is constricted, this material is then deposited and can contribute to a reduction in channel capacity. History =Etymology= Salford (left) and Manchester. The origins of the name \\"Irwell\\" are uncertain but many accept the Anglo-Saxon origin, ere-well, meaning \\"hoar or white spring\\". The first part of the name may also be the Brittonic *ar, an ancient river-name element that implies horizontal motion, \\"flowing\\", \\"rising\\" or else \\"springing up\\". =Ancient history= Flint scrapers, knives and other materials associated with the neolithic period were discovered on Kersal Moor in the late 19th century and early 20th century. There have been isolated finds of artefacts characteristic of this period along the Irwell valley, and a possible hunting site was excavated at Prestwich Golf Course in 1982, which produced a quantity of Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age flints. Neolithic tools have also been found in the River Roch near Bury and in Radcliffe, and Bronze Age burial sites have been found in Bury and Shuttleworth. =Celtic, Roman and Medieval= The first recorded human settlements were those of the Celtic tribe, the Brigantes, who farmed the uplands and lower reaches of the river in the late Iron Age. In AD 79 the Roman Empire conquered these tribes, building forts at the confluences of the Irwell and the rivers Irk and Medlock and naming the town Mamucium. They also built a ford with rectangular stone blocks at Cornbrook, which is thought to be the first man-made structure to span the river. For four hundred years the Pax Romana brought peace, but their withdrawal in AD 410 left the tribes at the mercy of the Saxons, who renamed the town Manigceastre. The Danes later seized, and all-but destroyed Manigceastre, and absorbed what was left of the tribes. The Danelaw ruled until AD 920 when the Norsemen were expelled by Edward the Elder. In the Middle Ages the town, which was now known as Manceastre (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most important part of the gift was the fishing rights on the River Irwell, and even in the 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.see:Hansard 18 April 1950 vol 474 cc91-106 =19th century= During the Industrial Revolution factories, mills and terraced hovels grew up along the river banks. Joseph Corbett, the Borough Engineer of Salford, wrote in his 1907 book The River Irwell of his father Edward's experiences around 1819, of seeing \\"large shoals of fish, chiefly gudgeon but also other fish, rising to the flies\\" from a vantage point on New Bailey bridge, (now Albert Bridge) in Manchester. Local industry dumped toxic chemicals into the river, such as gas- tar, gas-lime and ammonia water, and by 1850 fish stocks had all but disappeared. In 1860 the Irwell was described as \\"almost proverbial for the foulness of its waters; receiving the refuse of cotton factories, coal mines, print works, bleach works, dye works, chemical works, paper works, almost every kind of industry.\\" In 1862 the Scottish geologist Hugh Miller wrote about the Irwell, in his book First Impressions: The English People, describing it as: > The hapless river‚Äîa pretty enough stream a few miles higher up, with trees > overhanging its banks, and fringes of green sedge set thick along its > edges‚Äîloses caste as it gets among the mills and the printworks. There are > myriads of dirty things given it to wash, and whole waggon-loads of poisons > from dye-houses and bleachyards thrown into it to carry away; steam-boilers > discharge into it their seething contents, and drains and sewers their fetid > impurities; till at length it rolls on‚Äîhere between tall dingy walls, there > under precipices of red sandstone‚Äîconsiderably less a river than a flood of > liquid manure, in which all life dies, whether animal or vegetable, and > which resembles nothing in nature, except, perhaps, the stream thrown out in > eruption by some mud-volcano. Waterfoot in Rossendale In the Victorian era passenger boat trips were popular but cut-short by the foul smells from the river. In 1862 the Corporation of Salford promoted an Act of Parliament enabling them to establish a River Conservancy Committee; they appointed a river inspector, and had to power to take action against anyone polluting the river. The Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876 was designed to solve the problems of river pollution, but it was largely ineffective. It did, however, lay the groundwork for the more draconian legislation which followed, and in 1891 the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was formed. Local authorities were ordered to provide sewage treatment facilities, and industrial concerns were told to use the best practical means of preventing pollution. Salford was one of the first authorities in the Irwell watershed to install intercepting sewers and sewage treatment works at Mode Wheel Sewage works. One of the most famous characters associated with the river during this time was Mark Addy, who was born in a tenement on The Parsonage near Blackfriars Bridge in Manchester in 1838. Whenever anyone was in difficulty in the river, the cry would go up \\"Bring Mark Addy!\\" and he would race to the rescue. He was awarded a number of medals including the gold and silver medals from the Humane Society for the Hundred of Salford, and the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal. In 1878 he became the only civilian ever to be awarded the Albert Medal (first class), His final rescue was on Whit Monday in 1889, when he saved a young boy from a particularly sewage-laden section of the river. After this he became ill, and died of tuberculosis in 1890 aged 51. He had rescued over 50 people from the river during his lifetime. =20th century= The Industrial Revolution saw the river badly polluted by industry, as pictured in this photograph of Radcliffe taken in 1902. In 1939, the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was superseded by the Lancashire Rivers Board, but wartime conditions brought about further deterioration of the river. In 1951, the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act was passed and this board disappeared to be replaced by the Mersey River Board, which was replaced in turn by the Mersey and Weaver River Authority in 1965. During a 1950s television documentary entitled River of Irwell, the watercourse was described as \\"The hardest worked river in the world\\". In 1946, there was serious flooding in Salford, caused by a bottleneck at a bend in the river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years,Hampson (1930), Book Four: 1800‚Äì1930, Chapter VI: \\"Peel Park and the Irwell Floods\\". and, in 1946, the decision was made to straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was ¬£2m. In a question to the House of Commons in 1950 the Member of Parliament for Rossendale, Mr. Anthony Greenwood, highlighted the lamentable condition of the Irwell and one of its main tributaries, the River Roch: > Today I am afraid that fish in most of those rivers are virtually extinct. > Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange > Station and looks down at the noisome black water which flows beneath him > would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living > creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so > rightly called that \\"melancholy stream\\"... I have had my differences with > the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the > excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for > that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar > survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the > third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that > report which I should like to read. The first says: \\"The banks are lined > with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the > drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and > discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the > main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters > the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship > Canal.\\" The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than > the first. It is: \\"There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very > occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except > sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to > profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the > most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight > as being the purest water which the rivers hold.\\" The full importance of > that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency > with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are > subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell. In 1951, it was announced that flood defence works were to be carried out on the stretch of the river passing through Lower Broughton between Cromwell Bridge and Gerald Road Bridge, although local property owners and shopkeepers were outraged at being asked to bear part of the cost. Work on the concrete wall did not get underway until June 1952 and was still only nearing completion when, in August 1957, nearby homes were threatened by flooding during heavy rain. 1970s Iron oxide pollution near the river's source A report in the Manchester Evening News in 1971 stated that Bury Angling Society had signed an agreement with Bury Corporation giving them fishing rights along of the river between Summerseat and Radcliffe. The secretary of the society was quoted as saying: > Extensive tests have been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are > satisfied that the water will support fish life. Roach and perch have > already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is > no doubt the pollution is clearing. It will be a long job, but we are sure > there is a future for angling in the river. The report went on to state that the society \\"intends to carry out stocking operations soon\\". In 1972 the newspaper reported that \\"tiddlers\\" (small fish) had been seen swimming in the \\"notorious inky Irwell\\" near Peel Park, Salford. The Deputy chief water quality officer for Salford, Mr. Eric Harper, said: > Ten years ago, any fish getting as far down as Salford would have been > killed almost immediately by the pollution in the water. Although the river > there is now a great deal better than it has been for 100 years, fish will > probably not be able to live long. These had probably got into the main > river from small streams flowing into the Irwell. But I think it is real > progress. Mr Harper went on to say that the Irwell had been well stocked with fish along its whole length 100 years ago but refused to guess when it would reach the same state again. In 1974 all of the river authorities were merged into the Regional Water Authorities. In the 1974 annual report of the North West Water Authority (NWWA), it was said that the river \\"once internationally famous, or infamous as the epitome of river pollution, is now in a much better state as compared with its condition at the time of a special survey carried out nine years ago.\\" This was reported in an article in The Manchester Evening News on 26 October of that year which stated that: > During nine years of pollution control work reviewed by the North West Water > Authority, the biggest improvement had been in the Bolton District, where > effluent from five dilapidated sewage plants and two paper mills were now > being treated at the Ringley Fold Works [but] there has been little > reduction in pollution from the river Roch. At Bacup the headwater of the > Irwell is discoloured by ochre deposits from a disused mine but work is > being done to stop the ochre seepage. Fish do exist in the stretch between > Rossendale and Bury and fish are to be introduced in stretches between > Radcliffe and Manchester. However, it is feared that it will be many years > before fish will be able to breed freely in the river. 1980s In 1980, a scheme for improving a section of the river between Littleton Road and Adelphi Weir in Salford for boating purposes was included in Greater Manchester Policy Committee's capital programme for 1981/82. County Councillors at a recent committee meeting had criticised the condition of the river, with the councillor for the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham calling it \\"quite revolting and horrible\\". A spokesperson for the NWWA said that, although the river had a reputation for being polluted, it was getting much better but still had not reached a state where they would be satisfied. She added that tests were being carried out to show the improved cleanliness of the Irwell and that 600 trout had recently been put in the river at Summerseat, near Bury. The proposals were welcomed by both Salford University and Agecroft Rowing Club, with the university stating that they wished to use that section for their boat race. Later that year it was reported that hundreds of trees and shrubs were to be planted along the banks of the Irwell between Broughton and Pomona Dock in a ¬£650,000 \\"green finger\\" scheme to \\"bring the countryside into the heart of industrial Salford\\". The dossier outlining the scheme, prepared by Salford's Technical Services Officer, emphasised the \\"bleak character\\" of the Irwell Valley with \\"many constructions by the river that are decaying and rotting\\" and said \\"the main problems are caused by an excess of ammonia and a high organic content from sewage effluents which discharge into the water upstream.\\" The report recommended that \\"even more support should be given to the NWWA in their pollution control of the River Irwell.\\" Throughout the 1980s, sightings of fish as far downstream as Manchester city centre were reported in local newspapers. In February 1981 the Manchester Evening News reported that \\"ten jacksharps [sticklebacks], about two inches long\\" had been spotted by a site manager working on the Mark Addy public house, which was then being built on the disused New Bailey Landing Stage, below New Bailey Street, on the border of Manchester and Salford. Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. In 1983 over 100 canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could \\"transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester\\". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16 km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still \\"a class 4 river ‚Äì top of the pollution chart\\". During 1985 the Croal‚ÄìIrwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187 proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that ¬£67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches on the side of the river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8 km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre \\"mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford ‚Äì the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing ¬£500m of investment and 13,000 new jobs over the next 10 years\\". The Manchester Ship Canal Company also announced a ¬£70 million redevelopment scheme for Pomona Docks in Salford, to include a marina, homes, offices and other commercial developments. 1990s Trinity Bridge In 1990, the newly formed Mersey and Irwell Packet Company launched regular tourist trips along the river from a landing stage opposite the Granada Studios Tour entrance in Quay Street, taking in the stretch from Castlefield to Salford Quays. This was not universally welcomed as, by September of that year, a retired chemical engineer claimed that the pleasure boat was \\"leaving clouds of methane in its wake as it disturbed sediment on the river bed\\". However, in 1991 a feature article appeared in the magazine Lancashire Life extolling the virtues of the cruise, and stating that the Irwell \\"once thought a liability is in fact a major asset to urban regeneration ... now the twin cities compete to befriend her, to dress her in finery and proudly introduce her back into society. And the public are cordially invited back onto her waters.\\" During 1994, construction work began on a new ¬£1.3M footbridge to link Manchester and Salford, to be known as Trinity Bridge. The box-girder and steel cable construction was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava to represent a ship in full sail as the centrepiece of the ¬£50M Chapel Wharf Regeneration Scheme, which was expected to breathe new life into a run-down area of Salford and to create up to 8,000 new jobs. In May 1995 a new long multimillion-pound arts trail, to be known as the Irwell Sculpture Trail, was reported in the Manchester Evening News and in June 1997 work began on the ¬£10 million Lower Irwell Valley Flood Defence Scheme in Lower Kersal. =21st century= Broughton In July 2000 there was a setback for the clean-up programme when a pollution incident affected approximately of the river between Rawtenstall and Ramsbottom, causing the death of more than 36,000 fish. The large number of fish killed, however, did serve to illustrate how much the river had improved from the lifeless, \\"melancholy stream\\" of the 1950s. In 2005 a ¬£1M project to make the river \\"the cleanest it has been for decades\\" was announced by United Utilities. The improvements included fitting filters on sewers in Lower Broughton to ensure litter was not washed into the river, as part of a scheme to improve overflows across Adlington, Wigan, Chorley, Rochdale and Bury. Then in October 2008 United Utilities announced that work on the Ringley Fold Wastewater Works in Stoneclough, to be completed by the end of the year, should increase the number of fish in the river and \\"massively improve the environment locally so walkers, canoeists and anglers will all reap the benefits.\\" The company said that this was to be the biggest scheme that they had undertaken in the region, and the project manager was quoted as saying: > \\"Reducing the amount of phosphate in the water is the main driver behind the > scheme. New legislation states that the amount of phosphate in waste water > should be one milligram per litre because it causes water to clog with algae > and reduces the amount of oxygen in the water, which results in less aquatic > life and fish.\\" The treatment plant, which was built in the 1930s and last updated in the 1970s, treats waste water from a population of half a million, from Bolton, Prestwich, Whitefield and Clifton. There was another pollution incident in March 2008 when twenty miles of the river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution at a cost of ¬£1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported. Commerce Stickings Lock on the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, c 1850 =Mersey and Irwell Navigation= In the late 17th century, the Warrington businessman Thomas Patten had made the River Mersey navigable as far as Warrington and suggested that there would be significant commercial value in extending this along the Irwell as far as Manchester. In 1721, Parliament authorised the alteration with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Act, and by 1736 work had been completed by creating eight canal locks along the route from Warrington to Manchester, allowing access to boats of up to 51 tonnes. The waterway, which became known as the Mersey & Irwell Navigation, played a central role in the cotton industry of the 18th century that spearheaded the Industrial Revolution. =Bridgewater Canal= When Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater built the Bridgewater Canal, the task of crossing the Irwell was one of the main obstacles he faced. The solution was to build a canal- carrying bridge across the river, the first barge aqueduct in England. The aqueduct, which opened in 1761, measured high and long, and became one of the wonders of the age. The Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Bridgewater Canal competed for trade to and from Manchester for the next 120 years and specially designed barges with a shallow draft, known as \\"Mersey flats\\", were used on both waterways. Over the years both trade and rivalry continued to grow with each company offering reduced freight charges or special rates and concessions to gain business from the other. The most important cargo carried was raw cotton from Liverpool to Manchester but timber, dyewoods, pig iron, lead, copper, nails, tar, sand, grain and flour were also carried. Passenger services had been operating on the Bridgewater Canal for some years and in 1807 the Irwell and Mersey Navigation Company began to compete with daily services between Runcorn and Manchester. In 1816 they began to use packet steamers. However, in 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened; packet boat services went into decline, and ceased to operate completely in the 1860s. In Manchester two other canals used the Irwell as a point of access: the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal from 1809, and the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal from 1839. The previous year, the short Hulme Locks Branch Canal had also connected the Irwell to the Bridgewater Canal at Castlefield. All are now non-navigable, although the first is under restoration. =Manchester Ship Canal= The River Mersey empties into the Manchester Ship Canal at Irlam As the 19th century progressed, the increasing need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues charged by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for ¬£1,710,000, which was at the time the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began. The canal, which was made by greatly deepening and widening the eastern section of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, opened on 1 January 1894. It reduced the shipping costs of raw cotton to the mills and the dispatching the finished cloth overseas. The canal had helped the region to become the centre of the Industrial Revolution, and it had transformed Manchester into England's third largest port, despite being inland. As the canal was built, it became clear that Brindley's famous aqueduct would have to be demolished, as it allowed insufficient headroom for the freighters that the canal would carry. Fortunately, in 1896 the councillors of Eccles paid to have the aqueduct moved to the spot it occupies today, alongside the canal. The Bridgewater Canal is now carried over the Manchester Ship Canal by the equally celebrated Barton Swing Aqueduct, which was completed in 1893 with the novel idea of \\"opening\\" by rotating 90 degrees to allow ships to pass. The construction of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks led to the development of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next eighty years. By the 1960s however, the UK had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had gone into decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. The decline of heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight- carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about the decline of the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982. River Irwell flood defence scheme Peel Park flood obelisk showing the 1866 flood level. A second flood line was added after the 1870 floods. The lower reaches of the Irwell have flooded many times in its history, the most well documented being the floods of 1866, 1946, 1954, 1980, 2007, 2015 and 2020. In December 1816 rapidly thawing snow caused the river to flood, sweeping away a considerable amount of property including building materials and livestock. Locals reported the height of the river to have been almost as great as a more serious flood of 1768. A local public house, the Black Boy, suffered extensive damage as the water caused the rear wall to collapse, a local brewery was flooded with the loss of all its stock, and a Mersey Flat came free of its moorings, hitting Regent Bridge. In 1866, the \\"year of the great Flood\\", rain fell for three continuous days commencing on Tuesday 13 November. By the end of the first day, the river had risen above normal at Peel Park, street lamps could not be lit and mills were brought to a stop. In all, ¬£1 million of property was damaged, 450 hectares of land was flooded, 700 people had to be rescued from wrecked homes, but only one man died by drowning. The height of the flood was marked by an obelisk erected in Peel Park. The construction of the ship canal is said to have reduced the risk of flooding, by providing a larger outlet below Regent bridge. In 1946 in Salford 5,300 properties were flooded, and 600 were flooded in 1954. To alleviate such problems two flood storage basins with a capacity of have been constructed to the west of Littleton Road, Kersal, at a cost of around ¬£11 million. As part of the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme, the defences help to protect some 3,000 properties in Kersal and Lower Broughton against a 1 in 75 year flood. Concerns have been raised that a 1 in a 100-year flood would breach these defences and cause some ¬£55 million damage to property. The defences proved successful on 22 January 2008, when the worst flooding to hit the region in thirty years caused the Irwell to burst its banks further downstream in the centre of Manchester. On 2 February 2018 the Environment Agency announced the completion of A ¬£10 million extension to the flood defence scheme which will protect almost 2,000 homes and businesses and has created more than 5 hectares of high quality urban wetland habitat. The new development also provides a new footpath around the site which links to existing footpaths to provide a green route to and from the centre of Manchester. The 28 hectare flood basin will protect surrounding properties by holding up to 650 million litres of water during flood conditions. The scheme, utilises an ‚Äòoffline‚Äô storage basin, created in a meander of the Irwell on the site of the old Manchester Racecourse, that will work in tandem with the existing flood storage area at Littleton Road. The embankment around the basin features an inlet to allow the controlled spill of water into the basin when river levels are high. Water will then be stored in the basin during a flood and released back into the river once the water level has dropped. The flood embankments have also been planted with 10 hectares of wildflower habitat, to attract pollinating species such as moths, butterflies and bees. Regeneration Ontario Basin, Salford Quays A large urban regeneration project, The Salford Quays Development Plan, was published in 1985 and work began a few years later to redevelop the site for residential, business and leisure purposes. The Salford Quays waterside development has made living by the Irwell, and the Manchester Ship Canal into which it flows, fashionable once again. There are further plans to \\"turn the tide on the years of neglect and once again embrace the River Irwell as a fundamental part of Manchester and Salford's heritage and future economic and social growth. The vision is to reinvent the central Manchester conurbation as the major waterfront destination in Northern England.\\" A number of key stakeholders are involved in the development of this regeneration vision. These include Manchester, Salford and Trafford councils, Manchester Ship Canal Company, Environment Agency, Mersey Basin Campaign, local businesses, landowners, community groups and the wider Manchester, Salford and Trafford communities. =Irwell City Park= In 2007 Manchester City Council, Salford City Council and Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council prepared planning guidance to support the delivery of a project for the restoration of the river and creation of a new urban park, to be called Irwell City Park. The intention is to develop of riverside between The Meadows and Peel Park in the north, through Salford and Manchester city centres, Ordsall and Pomona Dock areas, around to Salford Quays and Trafford Wharfside. The three authorities formally adopted the draft Planning Guidance in March 2008. The Guidance sets out the guidelines that the councils will use as a material consideration in determining applications for planning permission and other matters in the Irwell City Park area. It also establishes a set of principles to ensure the provision of a continuous riverside cycle/walkway, and the high quality design of new public open spaces and other infrastructure. An application is to be made to the North West Development Agency in October 2008 to support pre-project implementation work, including design and technical feasibility work. Sport on the Irwell Rowing has existed along the river in Manchester and Salford since 1823. A regatta was inaugurated on 12 September 1842 on a straight course from Throstle's Nest Weir to Regent Road Bridge. Racing continued in Manchester with events such as Agecroft Regatta and Warburton Regatta. At the turn of the 20th century, rowing was very popular in the area with many local clubs such as Nemesis, Prince of Wales, Minerva, Didsbury and Agecroft all competing regularly. With the decline in the condition of the water, by the Second World War only Agecroft and Broughton rowing clubs were still active. Agecroft Rowing Club was formed in 1861, making it one of the oldest open membership rowing clubs in the world. The club was originally based in the grounds of Agecroft Hall and then a short distance downstream at Littleton Road. However, the river became impossible for eight's and fours to pass due to the encroachment of weeds and river life following the clean up of the environment. The club now operates from a boat house next to the Salford Watersports Centre at Salford Quays, which it has shared with the University of Salford Boat Club since 2004. The boat house, which the sport's governing body, British Rowing, has nominated as the North West Centre of Excellence, also hosts the Two Cities Boat Race, which has been held on the river since 1972. This river is home to the Salford Friendly Anglers' Society, the oldest angling society in the world, founded in 1817.

Mike Seeger, John Cohen and Tom Paley were its founding members. Tracy Schwarz replaced Paley, who left the group in 1962. Seeger died of cancer in 2009, Paley died in 2017, and Cohen died in 2019. NLCR participated in the old-time music revival, and directly influenced many later musicians. Career The Ramblers distinguished themselves by focusing on the traditional playing styles they heard on old 78rpm records of musicians recorded during the 1920s and 1930s, many of whom had earlier appeared on the Anthology of American Folk Music. The New Lost City Ramblers refused to \\"sanitize\\" these southern sounds as did other folk groups of the time, such as the Weavers or Kingston Trio. Instead, the Ramblers have always strived for an authentic sound. However, the Ramblers did not merely copy the old recordings that inspired them. Rather, they would use the various old-time styles they encountered while at the same time not becoming slaves to imitation. The Ramblers named themselves in response to a request by Moe Asch, based on an amalgam of a favorite tune, J. E. Mainer's \\"New Lost Train Blues\\"; a favorite group, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers; and a reference to the urban settings in which they played old-timey music. On Songs from the Depression, the New Lost City Ramblers performed a variety of popular political songs from the New Deal days, all but one of them taken from commercially issued 78s, and that one is \\"Keep Moving\\", identified in the album notes only as \\"from Tony Schwartz's collection -- singer unidentified\\" FW05264 liner notes, also may be read at the Smithsonian site when actually it is by Agnes \\"Sis\\" Cunningham, the full title being \\"How Can You Keep On Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)\\". The omission later caused Ry Cooder, who listened to the Ramblers album, to record the song as Traditional on the first edition of his Into the Purple Valley album, an omission he gladly corrected when informed of it. Cooder also covered another song from the same New Lost City Ramblers album, which he may have heard on a poorly labeled cassette copy: \\"Taxes on the Farmer Feeds Us All\\" which the New Lost City Ramblers credit to Fiddling John Carson but which the Cooder notes still list as \\"traditional\\".Compare Smithsonian Folkways notes to \\"Into the Purple Valley\\" The same is true of the track \\"Boomer's Story\\", covered by the Ramblers‚ÄîCooder credits it as \\"traditional\\", but the song was written by Carson Robison and first recorded by him in 1929 under the title \\"The Railroad Boomer\\". In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Bob Dylan described the impression the Ramblers made on him when he heard their records in 1960: > Everything about them appealed to me‚Äîtheir style, their singing, their > sound. I liked the way they looked, the way they dressed and I especially > liked their name. Their songs rang the gamut in style, everything from > mountain ballads to fiddle tunes and railway blues... I'd stay with the > Ramblers for days. At the time, I didn't know they were replicating > everything they did off old 78 records, but what would it have mattered > anyway? It wouldn't have mattered at all. They had originality in spades, > were men of mystery. I couldn't listen to them enough.Bob Dylan, Chronicles > Volume One, 2004, p.238 The group drifted apart during the latter half of the 1960s. Schwarz and Seeger performed with different musicians and together formed the short lived Strange Creek Singers. The New Lost City Ramblers' extensive recordings for the Folkways label became, after the death of Moe Asch, part of the Smithsonian Institution, which reissues Folkways titles on CD. John Cohen is said to have inspired the titular John of the Grateful Dead's 1970 song \\"Uncle John's Band\\".

Although DEA has a strong link to production theory in economics, the tool is also used for benchmarking in operations management, where a set of measures is selected to benchmark the performance of manufacturing and service operations. In benchmarking, the efficient DMUs, as defined by DEA, may not necessarily form a ‚Äúproduction frontier‚Äù, but rather lead to a ‚Äúbest-practice frontier‚Äù (Charnes A., W. W. Cooper and E. Rhodes (1978)).For more details and discussions, see Chapter 8 in Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/36161/frontmatter/9781107036161_frontmatter.pdf In contrast to parametric methods that require the ex-ante specification of a production- or cost function, non-parametric approaches compare feasible input and output combinations based on the available data only. DEA, as one of the most commonly used non-parametric methods owes its name to its enveloping property of the dataset's efficient DMUs, where the empirically observed, most efficient DMUs constitute the production frontier against which all DMUs are compared. DEA's popularity stems from its relative lack of assumptions, ability to benchmark multi-dimensional inputs and outputs as well as computational ease owing to it being expressable as a linear program, despite aiming to calculate efficiency ratios. History Building on the ideas of Farrell (1957), the seminal work \\"Measuring the efficiency of decision making units\\" by Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes (1978) applies linear programming to estimate an empirical production technology frontier for the first time. In Germany, the procedure was used earlier to estimate the marginal productivity of R&D; and other factors of production. Since then, there have been a large number of books and journal articles written on DEA or applying DEA on various sets of problems. Starting at the CCR model by Charnes, Cooper and RhodesCharnes A., W. W. Cooper and E. Rhodes (1978). ‚ÄúMeasuring the Efficiency of Decision Making Units.‚Äù EJOR 2: 429-444., many extensions to DEA have been proposed in the literature. They range from adapting implicit model assumption such as input and output orientation, distinguishing technical and allocative efficiency, adding limited disposability of inputs/outputs or varying returns- to-scale to techniques that utilize DEA results and extend them for more sophisticated analyses, such as stochastic DEA or cross-efficiency analysis. Techniques In an one-input, one-output scenario, efficiency is merely the ratio of output over input that can be produced and comparing several entities/DMUs based on it is trivial. However, when adding more inputs or outputs the efficiency computation becomes more complex. Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) in their basic DEA model (CCR) define the objective function to find DMU_j's efficiency (\\\\theta_j) as: \\\\max \\\\quad \\\\theta_j = \\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{m=1}^{M}y_m^j u_m^j}{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{n=1}^{N}x_n^j v_n^j}, where the DMU_j's known M outputs y_1^j,...,y_m^j are multiplied by their respective weights u_1^j,...,u_m^j and divided by the N inputs x_1^j,...,x_n^j multiplied by their respective weights v_1^j,...,v_n^j. The efficiency score \\\\theta_j is sought to be maximized, under the constraints that using those weights on each DMU_k \\\\quad k=1,...,K, no efficiency score exceeds one: \\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{m=1}^{M}y_m^k u_m^j}{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{n=1}^{N}x_n^k v_n^j} \\\\leq 1 \\\\qquad k = 1,...,K, and all inputs, outputs and weights have to be non- negative. To allow for linear optimization, one typically constrains either the sum of outputs or sum of inputs to equal a fixed value (typically 1). Because this optimization problem's dimensionality is equal to the sum of its inputs and outputs, selecting the smallest number of inputs/outputs that collectively, accurately capture the process one attempts to characterize is crucial. Because the production frontier envelopment is done empirically, several guidelines exist on the minimum required number of DMUs for good discriminatory power of the analysis, given homogeneity of the sample. This minimum number of DMUs varies between number twice the sum of inputs and outputs (2 (M + N)) and twice the product of inputs and outputs (2 M N). Some advantages of DEA approach are: * no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function * capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs * capable of being used with any input-output measurement, although ordinal variables remain tricky * the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit * using the dual of the optimization problem identifies which DMUs is evaluating itself against which other DMUs Some of the disadvantages of DEA are: * results are sensitive to the selection of inputs and outputs * high efficiency values can be obtained by being truly efficient or having a niche combination of inputs/outputs * the number of efficient firms on the frontier increases with the number of inputs and output variables * a DMU's efficiency scores may be obtained by using non-unique combinations of weights on the input and/or output factors Example Assume that we have the following data: * Unit 1 produces 100 items per day, and the inputs per item are 10 dollars for materials and 2 labour-hours * Unit 2 produces 80 items per day, and the inputs are 8 dollars for materials and 4 labour-hours * Unit 3 produces 120 items per day, and the inputs are 12 dollars for materials and 1.5 labour-hours To calculate the efficiency of unit 1, we define the objective function (OF) as *Max Efficiency :(100u_1)/(10v_1+2v_2) which is subject to (ST) all efficiency of other units (efficiency cannot be larger than 1): *Efficiency of unit 1: (100u_1)/(10v_1+2v_2)\\\\leq 1 *Efficiency of unit 2: (80u_1)/(8v_1+4v_2)\\\\leq 1 *Efficiency of unit 3: (120u_1)/(12v_1+1.5v_2)\\\\leq 1 and non-negativity: *u,v \\\\geq 0 A fraction with decision variables in the numerator and denominator is nonlinear. Since we are using a linear programming technique, we need to linearize the formulation, such that the denominator of the objective function is constant (in this case 1), then maximize the numerator. The new formulation would be: * OF **Max Efficiency :100u_1 *ST ** Efficiency of unit 1: 100u_1-(10v_1+2v_2)\\\\leq 0 ** Efficiency of unit 2: 80u_1-(8v_1+4v_2)\\\\leq 0 ** Efficiency of unit 3: 120u_1-(12v_1+1.5v_2)\\\\leq 0 **Denominator of nonlinear OF: 10v_1+2v_2=1 ** Non-negativity: u,v \\\\geq 0 Extensions A desire to Improve upon DEA, by reducing its disadvantages or strengthening its advantages has been a major cause for many discoveries in the recent literature. The currently most often DEA-based method to obtain unique efficiency rankings is called cross-efficiency. Originally developed by Sexton et al. in 1986, it found widespread application ever since Doyle and Green's 1994 publication. Cross-efficiency is based on the original DEA results, but implements a secondary objective where each DMU peer-appraises all other DMU's with its own factor weights. The average of these peer-appraisal scores is then used to calculate a DMU's cross-efficiency score. This approach avoids DEA's disadvantages of having multiple efficient DMUs and potentially non- unique weights. Another approach to remedy some of DEA's drawbacks is Stochastic DEA, which synthesizes DEA and SFA.Ole B.

Scholars rely upon the extant sources, such as those of contemporaries like Aristophanes or disciples of Socrates like Plato and Xenophon, for knowing anything about Socrates. However, these sources contain contradictory details of his life, words, and beliefs when taken together. This complicates the attempts at reconstructing the beliefs and philosophical views held by the historical Socrates. It is apparent to scholarship that this problem is now deemed a task seeming impossible to clarify and thus perhaps now classified as unsolvable.Prior, W. J., \\"The Socratic Problem\\" in Benson, H. H. (ed.), A Companion to Plato (Blackwell Publishing, 2006), pp. 25‚Äì35. Socrates was the main character in most of Plato's dialogues and was a genuine historical figure. It is widely understood that in later dialogues Plato used the character Socrates to give voice to views that were his own. Besides Plato, three other important sources exist for the study of Socrates: Aristophanes, Aristotle, and Xenophon. Since no extensive writings of Socrates himself survive to the modern era, his actual views must be discerned from the sometimes contradictory reports of these four sources. The main sources for the historical Socrates are the Sokratikoi logoi, or Socratic dialogues, which are reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates.J Ambury. Socrates (469‚Äì399 B.C.E.)

Xenophon  There are four works of Xenophon that deal with Socrates. They are Apology of Socrates to the Jurors (which apparently reports the defence given by Socrates in court (connection to Oxyrynchus was found in here p.33)), Memorabilia (which is a defence of Socrates and so-called Socratic dialogues), Oeconomicus (which concerns Socrates' encounter with Ischomachus and Critobulus), and Symposium (which recounts an evening at a dinner party to which Socrates was an attendee).M MacLaren - Xenophon.

Plato, like some of his contemporaries, wrote dialogues about his teacher. Much of what is known about Socrates comes from Plato's writings; however, it is widely believed that very few, if any, of Plato's dialogues can be verbatim accounts of conversations between them or unmediated representations of Socrates' thought. Many of the dialogues seem to use Socrates as a device for Plato's thought, and inconsistencies occasionally crop up between Plato and the other accounts of Socrates; for instance, Plato has Socrates denying that he would ever accept money for teaching, while Xenophon's Symposium clearly has Socrates stating that he is paid by students to teach wisdom and that this is what he does for a living. Stylometric analysis of the Plato corpus has led to the formation of a consensually agreed chronology classifying dialogues as falling approximately into three groups, Early, Middle and Late. On the assumption that there is an evolution of philosophical thought in Plato's dialogues from his early years to his middle and later years,Kr√§mer (1990) ascribes this view to Eduard Zeller (Hans Joachim Kr√§mer, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics, SUNY Press, 1990, pp. 93‚Äì4). the most common modern view is that Plato's dialogues contain a development of thought from closer to that of Socrates' to a doctrine more distinctly Plato's own.Penner, T. \\"Socrates and the early dialogues\\" in Kraut, R. (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Plato (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 121. See also Irwin, T. H., \\"The Platonic Corpus\\" in Fine, G. (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Plato (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 77‚Äì85. However, the question of exactly what aspects of Plato's dialogues are representative of Socrates and what are not, is far from agreed upon. Although the view that Plato's dialogues are developmental in their doctrines (with regard to the historical Socrates or not) is standard, the view is not without objectors who propose a unitarian view or other alternative interpretations of the chronology of the corpus.Rowe, C. \\"Interpreting Plato\\" in Benson, H. H. (ed.), A Companion to Plato (Blackwell Publishing, 2006), pp. 13‚Äì24. One notable example is Charles Kahn who argued that Plato had created his works not in a gradual way, but as a unified philosophical vision, whereby he uses Socratic dialogues, a non- historical genre, to flesh out his views. The time that Plato began to write his works and the date of composition of his last work are not known and what adds to the complexity is that even the ancient sources do not know the order of the works or the dialogues.  Aeschines  Two relevant works pertain to periods in Socrates' life, of which Aeschines could not have had any personal first-hand experiential knowledge. However, substantial amounts are extant of his works Alcibiades and Aspasia.C.H. Kahn - Aeschines on Socratic Eros in PA. Vander Waerdt - The Socratic Movement Cornell University Press, 1 Jan 1994 [Retrieved 2015-04-20]  Antisthenes  Antisthenes was a pupil of Socrates, and was known to accompany him.J Piering - Antisthenes Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy[Retrieved 2015-04-20]  Issues relating to the sources  = Ages of sources relative to Socrates = Aristophanes (c. 450‚Äì386 BCE) was alive during the early years of Socrates. One source shows Plato and Xenophon were about 45 years younger than Socrates, other sources show Plato as something in the range of 42‚Äì43 years younger, while Xenophon is thought to be 40 years younger. = Issues resulting from translation = Apart from the existing identified issue of conflicting elements present in accounts and writings, there is the additional inherent concern of the veracity of transfer of meaning by translation from classic Greek to modern language, whether that be English or any other.  History of the problem  Efforts have been made by writers for centuries to address the problem. According to one scholar (Patzer) the number of works with any significance in this issue, prior to the nineteenth century, are few indeed.J Bussanich, ND Smith - The Bloomsbury Companion to Socrates (please see - Note 14 & 16) A&C; Black, 3 Jan 2013 [Retrieved 2015-04-17] G.E. Lessing caused a flurry of interest in the problem in 1768. A methodology for analysis was posited, by study of Platonic sources, in 1820 with Socher. A break of scholarly impasse in respect to understanding, resulted from Campbell making a stylometric analysis in 1867. An essay written by Schleiermacher in 1815, published 1818 (English translation 1833) is considered the most significant and influential toward developing an understanding of the problem.M Trapp - Introduction: Questions of Socrates [Retrieved 3 May 2015] (p.xvi) Throughout the 20th century, two strains of interpretation arose: the literary contextualists, who tended to interpret Socratic dialogues based on literary criticism, and the analysts, who focus much more heavily on the actual arguments contained within the different texts. Early in the 21st century, most of the scholars concerned have settled to agreement instead of argument about the nature of the significance of ancient textual sources in relation to this problem.

Hare) Printed by J. Smith for Deightons, 1833 [Retrieved 2015-05-03] (sourced firstly at L-A Dorion in D.R. Morrison - The Cambridge Companion to Socrates) Schleiermacher maintained that the two dialogues Apology and Crito are purely Socratic. They were, therefore, accurate historical portrayals of the real man, and hence history and not Platonic philosophy at all. All of the other dialogues that Schleiermacher accepted as genuine he considered to be integrally bound together and consistent in their Platonism. Their consistency is related to the three phases of Plato's development: #Foundation works, culminating in Parmenides; #Transitional works, culminating in two so-called families of dialogues, the first consisting of Sophist, Statesman and Symposium, and the second of Phaedo and Philebus; and finally #Constructive works: Republic, Timaeus and Laws. Schleiermacher's views on the chronology of Plato's work are rather controversial. In Schleiermacher's view, the character of Socrates evolves over time into the \\"Stranger\\" in Plato's work, and fulfills a critical function in Plato's development, as he appears in the first family above as the \\"Eleatic Stranger\\" in Sophist and Statesman, and as the \\"Mantitenean Stranger\\" in the Symposium. The \\"Athenian Stranger\\" is the main character of Plato's Laws. Further, the Sophist‚ÄìStatesman‚ÄìPhilosopher family makes particularly good sense in this order, as Schleiermacher also maintains that the two dialogues, Symposium and Phaedo, show Socrates as the quintessential philosopher in life (guided by Diotima) and into death, the realm of otherness. Thus the triad announced both in the Sophist and in the Statesman is completed, though the Philosopher, being divided dialectically into a \\"Stranger\\" portion and a \\"Socrates\\" portion, isn't called \\"The Philosopher\\"; this philosophical crux is left to the reader to determine. Schleiermacher thus takes the position that the real Socratic problem is understanding the dialectic between the figures of the \\"Stranger\\" and \\"Socrates\\". Suggested solutions Four suggested solutions elucidated by Nails, and given early in the history of the problem, and still relevant currently, are: # Socrates is the individual whose qualities exhibited in Plato‚Äôs writings are corroborated by Aristophanes and Xenophon. # Socrates is he who claims ‚Äúto possess no wisdom‚Äù but still participates in exercises with the aim of gaining understanding. # Socrates is the [individual named] Socrates who appears in Plato‚Äôs earliest dialogues. # The real Socrates is the one who turns from a pre-Socratic interest in nature to ethics, instead.

Geographically, the mountains extend from Plze≈à Region and South Bohemia in the Czech Republic to Austria and Bavaria in Germany, and form the highest truncated uplands of the Bohemian Massif, up to 50 km wide. They create a natural border between the Czech Republic on one side and Germany and Austria on the other. Names and etymology For political reasons, the Bohemian and German sides have different names in their languages: in Czech, the Bohemian side is called ≈†umava and the Bavarian side Zadn√≠ Bavorsk√Ω les (), while in German, the Bohemian side is called B√∂hmerwald (), and the Bavarian side Bayerischer Wald (). In Czech, ≈†umava is also used as a name for the entire region in Bohemia and Germany. The designation ≈†umava has been attested in the late 15th century in Antonio Bonfini's work Rerum unganicarum decades. Folk etymology connects the name's origin with the Czech words ≈°um, ≈°umƒõn√≠ (literally hum, humming) denoting the noise of trees in the wind. The most accepted opinion among linguists derives ≈†umava from a theorized Proto-Slavic word '*≈°uma = \\"dense forest\\", cf. Serbian ≈°uma as it adjoins regions populated by Serbs of Lusatia and surrounds (North Eastern Bavaria and Saxony). There are corresponding toponyms in modern day Serbia (Balkans) i.e. ≈†umadija (land of dense forests). Modern Serbian maintains the use of the word '≈†uma' (Forrest) and the toponym ≈†umava equates to Forrested lands. Geography and climate The Bohemian Forest comprises heavily forested mountains with average heights of 800‚Äì1,400 metres. The highest peak is Gro√üer Arber (1,456 m) on the Bavarian side; the highest peak on the Bohemian and Austrian side is the Pl√∂ckenstein (Plech√Ω, 1,378 m). The most eastern peak is the Sternstein (1,125 m). The range is one of the oldest in Europe, and its mountains are eroded into round forms with few rocky parts. Typical for the Bohemian Forest are plateaux at about 1,000‚Äì1,200 m with relatively harsh climates and many peat bogs.

These rivers all spring from the Bohemian Forest. Owing to heavy precipitation (mostly snow), the peat bogs and the Lipno Dam, the ≈†umava region is an important water reservoir for Central Europe. More important for their aesthetic value than for holding water are several lakes of glacial origin. Nature As a border region, the Bohemian Forest has had a complicated history. In the 20th century it was part of the Iron Curtain, and large areas were stripped of human settlement. Even before that, settlement was sparse and for centuries forests dominated over human dwellings and pathways. These unique circumstances led to the preservation of unspoilt nature and forest ecosystems relatively unaffected by human activity. On the other hand, many habitats dependent on farming activity are slowly turning into forest. In the Czech Republic, the most valuable area is protected in the ≈†umava National Park and Protected Landscape and the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Part of the German section is protected as the Bavarian Forest National Park. The Bohemian Forest is a popular holiday destination because it is excellent hiking country. Most interesting natural and cultural sights are connected with more than 500 km of summer marked trails and many bike trails. However, park administration is not always successful in its task, and many believe the rapid growth of tourist accommodation and services is destroying the former calm of the ≈†umava region. ≈†umava National Park is also suffering from problems connected with bark beetles, and there is heated debate about how to deal with them. History The origin of the current name Bohemian Forest goes back to 400 BC. The Boii people spread across Europe between 400 BC and 8 BC. Boii is the Roman name of three ancient Celtic tribes, living in Transalpine Gaul (modern France), Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), and Bohemia, Moravia and western Slovakia. The European region of Bohemia owes its name to the Boii, who lived there until they were replaced by the Germanic Marcomanni and Serbian (Sorbian) ancestors as indicated in Administrado de Imperia in origins of Serbs the Land of Boiki also known as White Serbia. The Romans called it Boiohaemum, a Latinization of the Germanic name of the region, meaning \\"the home of the Boii\\". The mountain range has been traditionally identified with ŒìŒ±Œ≤œÅŒÆœÑŒ± ·ΩùŒªŒ∑ (Gabreta Forest), mentioned in Strabo's Geographica and Ptolemy's Geographia. In the 1st century AD, the forest was inhabited by Gallo-Romans as well as by Germanic tribes in its northern part. From the 13th century AD on Bavarian settlers after various wars with Serbs (modern Serbs/Sorbs) for domination over the region, cleared the forest and founded settlements in the to date largely uninhabited mountainous region, which thereby became culturally close to Bavaria. In 1945‚Äì1946, the region's Bohemian Germans were expelled. The originally Serbian population moved to adjoining placed which to this day testify to their origins in places throughout North Bohemia i.e Srbsk√° Kamenice.

(born November 24, 1954) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba and leader of the opposition in the Manitoba legislature from 2000 to 2006. From 2006 until 2009, Murray was the President and Chief Executive Officer of the St. Boniface Hospital Research Foundation.Martin Cash, \\"Byelection possible for Kirkfield Park\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 September 2006, A5; Kevin Rollason, \\"St. Boniface Hospital and Research Foundation committed fundraiser\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 January 2007, B4. He subsequently served as director and chief executive officer of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights from 2009 to 2014. Early life and career Murray was born in Lestock, Saskatchewan, and raised in Punnichy in the same province. His mother, Jean Murray, was a town councillor. He studied Science at the University of Manitoba, and transferred to Ryerson Polytechnical Institute to further his studies in Architectural Science. He later worked as road manager for the rock band Blood, Sweat and Tears, and in 1982 became media director for the Canadian Opera Company. Murray began working for Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1985. He moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1989 after being named vice-president of the family-owned Domo Gasoline Corporation, and became its CEO and president four years later. Murray was also an organizer for the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party in the 1990, 1995 and 1999 elections, and supported Kim Campbell's successful bid to succeed Mulroney as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1993.Carol Goar, \\"Not much passion - or bad blood\\", Toronto Star, 15 June 1993, A19. Murray was appointed to the board of Canadian National Railways in 1991, and served for one term.Rosemary Speirs, \\"PM gives loyal Tories jobs left by senators\\", Toronto Star, 15 February 1991, A10. He was a founding member of the Manitoba Entertainment Complex Group (MEC) in 1994, and chaired the successful World Hockey Junior Championship in 1999.Kelly Taylor, \\"Nite Out may take hit but backs MEC\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 November 1994, Entertainment; Jennifer Wells, \\"Jet Propulsion\\", Globe and Mail, 24 February 1995, P64; Scott Taylor, \\"Manitoba sets tourney record\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 December 1998, C1; \\"Who is Stu?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 November 2005, A8. In recognition of their contribution, he and his team were each awarded the Order of the Buffalo Hunt, one of Manitoba‚Äôs highest honours.https://portal.clubrunner.ca/1000/bulletin/View/3abc78bd-076a-4a6f-919b-c10922fbd6c0 Provincial politician After eleven years in power, the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives were defeated by Gary Doer's New Democratic Party in the 1999 election. Gary Filmon, the party's leader since 1983, stepped down in 2000. Murray soon emerged as the party establishment's preferred choice to succeed Filmon as leader.Daniel Lett, \\"Murray dons Filmon's mantle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 2000, A3. Darren Praznik considered running against him, but withdrew several months before the convention because of fundraising difficulties.Sean O'Connor, \\"Murray wins race of one to lead Tories\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 November 2000, A3. Murray was acclaimed as party leader in November 2000, and won a by-election in Kirkfield Park shortly thereafter. On December 5, he was sworn in as leader of the opposition. He criticized the New Democratic Party's 2001 budget for increased government spending, and called for significant tax cuts.David Kuxhaus, \\"NDP's spending 'out of control'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 April 2001, A7. He also argued the NDP was too close to provincial labour unions.David Kuxhaus, \\"Unions to getmore power, Tories say\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 May 2001, A4. Murray held progressive views on some social issues, and supported the principle of gay adoption rights late 2001.Helen Fallding, \\"Adoption rights for gay couples backed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 November 2001, A5. Murray was criticized for hiring Taras Sokolyk as an advisor in 2002 without informing his caucus. Sokolyk had previously been implicated in a vote-manipulation scheme involving the Independent Native Voice party, and was largely discredited as a political figure.\\"Manitoba Tory Leader Stuart Murray may face leadership challenge\\", Canadian Press, 28 October 2005, 12:42 report. Murray later spoke at a Winnipeg rally held in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.David Kuxhaus, \\"Pro-war rally draws 1,000\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 April 2003, A4. Murray led the Progressive Conservatives in the 2003 provincial election. His health strategy called for the government to purchase more surgeries and diagnostic services at private clinics, with the intent of reducing waiting times.Daniel Lett, \\"Tories say boost private clinics\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 May 2003, A1. He also promised to reintroduce workfare laws and to cancel the planned University College of the North, using the savings for tax cuts.Daniel Lett, \\"Murray plans to revive work-for-welfare law\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 May 2003, A3; Mia Rabson, \\"School on Tory hit list\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 2003, A1. NDP leader Gary Doer described this promise as spiteful. The Progressive Conservatives do not have a strong electoral support base in northern Manitoba. Murray argued that provincial laws were skewed in favour of labour unions, and considered introducing right-to-work legislation.Mia Rabson, \\"Murray takes aim at unions\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 May 2006, A3. His most radical proposal was to eliminate the taxation powers of local school boards.Nick Martin, \\"Tories' school plan sweeping\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 May 2003, B4. Gary Doer's NDP government was re-elected, and Murray's Conservatives slipped to 36.31% of the popular vote and 20 seats in the 57-member legislature. This was the party's worst showing since 1953. The NDP made historic inroads in south-end Winnipeg, while the Progressive Conservative Party's support was largely concentrated in the rural south of the province. A post-election editorial in the Winnipeg Free Press described Murray as \\"pleasant and even-tempered\\" but noted that he \\"did not make a deep impression on the public either by his work in the legislature or in the election campaign\\".\\"Editorial - PCs must plan ahead\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 June 2003, A10. Murray continued as party leader after the election. He recommended adopting Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for determining Manitoba's budget, and called for provincial whistleblower protection legislation.Stuart Murray, \\"Budget legislation needs toughening\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 January 2004, A13; Mia Rabson, \\"Tories seek whistle-blower legislation for Manitoba\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 April 2004, A5. He endorsed the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, and campaigned on behalf of Steven Fletcher in the 2004 federal election.Alexandra Paul, \\"Fletcher nomination galvanizes Tories\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 March 2004, A4. Despite concerns about Murray's leadership, the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives voted overwhelmingly against a leadership review in November 2004.Steve Lambert, \\"Manitoba Tories reject call for leadership review at annual meeting\\", Canadian Press, 13 November 2004, 18:56 report. In early 2004-05, Manitoba's labour-managed Crocus Investment Fund stopped trading and was forced into receivership after reports that it had misled shareholders and overstated the values of its assets. Doer's government was accused of improper oversight of the fund due to its ties to labour interests, and the resulting scandal initially threatened to damage the NDP's credibility.Steve Lambert, \\"Manitoba government faces questions over its role in troubled investment fund\\", Canadian Press, 1 June 2005, 17:22 report. Instead, it grew to encompass the Progressive Conservatives as well. Murray acknowledged that the Progressive Conservatives had received reports of irregularities at Crocus as early as 2002, but refrained from criticism after assurances from party advisers that the fund was in proper order.Mia Rabson, \\"Murray explains Tory silence\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 June 2005, A1. Murray was also advised that some companies associated with the Crocus fund were donors to the PC Party. These admissions may have prevented Murray from exploiting the scandal to his party's advantage; the NDP's popularity increased over the PCs increased in the summer of 2005.for instance, Daniel Lett, \\"Manitoba NDP stretches lead over Tories\\", 27 June 2005, A3. On November 5, 2005, a leadership review motion at the Progressive Conservative Party's annual general meeting received 55% support from delegates. Murray acknowledged the vote as disappointing, and called for a leadership convention to be held in light of the close result.Steve Lambert, \\"Manitoba opposition leader may quit\\", Globe and Mail, 5 November 2005, Breaking News.

Biography  Cory was born in Strathroy, Ontario and moved with his farming family to Gladstone, Manitoba in 1871.http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/cory_ww.shtml He studied law in Winnipeg and joined the Manitoba Attorney General's Office as a clerk in 1889, then joined the Dominion Department of the Interior in 1901. He was Assistant Commissioner of Dominion Lands from 1904 to 1905. Between 1905 and 1930 he was Deputy Minister of the Department of the Interior. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1909. = Commissioner of the Northwest Territories = In 1919 Cory was also appointed Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, holding the office until 1931. Only the second Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, Cory inherited a region that had barely been governed during the time of his predecessor.As Long As This Land Shall Last: A History of Treaty 8 and Treaty 11, 1870-1939 By Ren√© Fumoleau at Google Books Within months the new Commissioner had enacted a new ordinance (or law) regarding entry into the Northwest Territories, restricting access only to those pre-approved by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at various outposts in Alberta or the Yukon. The ordinance was cancelled a year later having been deemed ultra vires. However, during his tenure as Commissioner, Cory pursued further administration of the Territories, overseeing the appointment of councillors for the first time and establishing operations to facilitate the expansion of oil and gas interests in the region including the opening of the Territories' administration offices at Fort Smith in 1921. Later in 1921, a memo from the Commissioner's office concerned the well-being of the 150 white settlers of the District of Mackenzie and including future white interests in the Territories. It did not make any reference to the interests of the approximately 3,500 aboriginal population of the District of Mackenzie at that time. However alternative evidence suggests Cory himself was sympathetic to the region's Inuit populace as highlighted in a letter to the Hudson's Bay Company secretary, Edward Fitzgerald accusing Hudson's Bay Company post managers of exploiting the Inuit, and casting doubt on whether the Company could reform its trading system to prevent such abuses.The \\"True North\\" in Pictures? Photographic Representation in the Hudson's Bay Company's The Beaver Magazine, 1920-1945 by Peter Geller = Later life = Cory died in Montreal (St. Lambert) in 1943 and was buried in Ottawa. Cory is the namesake of Mount Cory, in Alberta.  Family  Cory married Laura Watson in 1888; they had three children: Edith, Louis and John. Edith married Alfred Bertram Rosevear and had eight children: John, William, Thomas, Margaret, Cory, Edith, Bertram, and Elizabeth. William married Cynthia and had a daughter named Stephanie. Cory married Elizabeth and had three children: Kenneth, Robin and Heather. Edith married J.D. Scanlan and had one daughter: Mary, who married Keith and had three children: Sarah, Emily, and Sophie.

The classical statement of the K√ºnneth theorem relates the singular homology of two topological spaces X and Y and their product space X \\\\times Y. In the simplest possible case the relationship is that of a tensor product, but for applications it is very often necessary to apply certain tools of homological algebra to express the answer. A K√ºnneth theorem or K√ºnneth formula is true in many different homology and cohomology theories, and the name has become generic. These many results are named for the German mathematician Hermann K√ºnneth.  Singular homology with coefficients in a field  Let X and Y be two topological spaces. In general one uses singular homology; but if X and Y happen to be CW complexes, then this can be replaced by cellular homology, because that is isomorphic to singular homology. The simplest case is when the coefficient ring for homology is a field F. In this situation, the K√ºnneth theorem (for singular homology) states that for any integer k, :\\\\bigoplus_{i + j = k} H_i(X; F) \\\\otimes H_j(Y; F) \\\\cong H_k(X \\\\times Y; F). Furthermore, the isomorphism is a natural isomorphism. The map from the sum to the homology group of the product is called the cross product. More precisely, there is a cross product operation by which an i-cycle on X and a j-cycle on Y can be combined to create an (i+j)-cycle on X \\\\times Y; so that there is an explicit linear mapping defined from the direct sum to H_k(X \\\\times Y). A consequence of this result is that the Betti numbers, the dimensions of the homology with \\\\Q coefficients, of X \\\\times Y can be determined from those of X and Y. If p_Z(t) is the generating function of the sequence of Betti numbers b_k(Z) of a space Z, then : p_{X \\\\times Y}(t) = p_X(t) p_Y(t). Here when there are finitely many Betti numbers of X and Y, each of which is a natural number rather than \\\\infty, this reads as an identity on Poincar√© polynomials. In the general case these are formal power series with possibly infinite coefficients, and have to be interpreted accordingly. Furthermore, the above statement holds not only for the Betti numbers but also for the generating functions of the dimensions of the homology over any field. (If the integer homology is not torsion-free, then these numbers may differ from the standard Betti numbers.)  Singular homology with coefficients in a principal ideal domain  The above formula is simple because vector spaces over a field have very restricted behavior. As the coefficient ring becomes more general, the relationship becomes more complicated. The next simplest case is the case when the coefficient ring is a principal ideal domain. This case is particularly important because the integers \\\\Z are a PID. In this case the equation above is no longer always true. A correction factor appears to account for the possibility of torsion phenomena. This correction factor is expressed in terms of the Tor functor, the first derived functor of the tensor product. When R is a PID, then the correct statement of the K√ºnneth theorem is that for any topological spaces X and Y there are natural short exact sequences :0 \\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{i + j = k} H_i(X; R) \\\\otimes_R H_j(Y; R) \\\\to H_k(X \\\\times Y; R) \\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{i + j = k-1} \\\\mathrm{Tor}_1^R(H_i(X; R), H_j(Y; R)) \\\\to 0. Furthermore, these sequences split, but not canonically. = Example = The short exact sequences just described can easily be used to compute the homology groups with integer coefficients of the product \\\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{RP}^2 of two real projective planes, in other words, H_k(\\\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{RP}^2; \\\\Z). These spaces are CW complexes. Denoting the homology group H_i(\\\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\\\Z) by h_i for brevity's sake, one knows from a simple calculation with cellular homology that :h_0\\\\cong \\\\Z, :h_1\\\\cong \\\\Z/2\\\\Z, :h_i= 0 for all other values of i. The only non-zero Tor group (torsion product) which can be formed from these values of h_i is :\\\\mathrm{Tor}^{\\\\Z}_1(h_1, h_1) \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{Tor}^{\\\\Z}_1(\\\\Z/2\\\\Z,\\\\Z/2\\\\Z)\\\\cong \\\\Z/2\\\\Z. Therefore, the K√ºnneth short exact sequence reduces in every degree to an isomorphism, because there is a zero group in each case on either the left or the right side in the sequence. The result is :\\\\begin{align} H_0 \\\\left (\\\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\\\Z \\\\right )\\\\; &\\\\cong \\\\;h_0 \\\\otimes h_0 \\\\;\\\\cong \\\\;\\\\Z  H_1 \\\\left (\\\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\\\Z \\\\right )\\\\; &\\\\cong \\\\; h_0 \\\\otimes h_1 \\\\; \\\\oplus \\\\; h_1 \\\\otimes h_0 \\\\;\\\\cong \\\\;\\\\Z/2\\\\Z\\\\oplus \\\\Z/2\\\\Z  H_2 \\\\left (\\\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\\\Z \\\\right )\\\\; &\\\\cong \\\\;h_1 \\\\otimes h_1 \\\\;\\\\cong \\\\;\\\\Z/2\\\\Z  H_3 \\\\left (\\\\mathbb{RP}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\\\Z \\\\right )\\\\; &\\\\cong \\\\;\\\\mathrm{Tor}^{\\\\Z}_1(h_1,h_1) \\\\;\\\\cong \\\\;\\\\Z/2\\\\Z  \\\\end{align} and all the other homology groups are zero.  The K√ºnneth spectral sequence  For a general commutative ring R, the homology of X and Y is related to the homology of their product by a K√ºnneth spectral sequence :E_{pq}^2 = \\\\bigoplus_{q_1 + q_2 = q} \\\\mathrm{Tor}^R_p(H_{q_1}(X; R), H_{q_2}(Y; R)) \\\\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(X \\\\times Y; R). In the cases described above, this spectral sequence collapses to give an isomorphism or a short exact sequence.  Relation with homological algebra, and idea of proof  The chain complex of the space X √ó Y is related to the chain complexes of X and Y by a natural quasi-isomorphism :C_*(X \\\\times Y) \\\\cong C_*(X) \\\\otimes C_*(Y). For singular chains this is the theorem of Eilenberg and Zilber. For cellular chains on CW complexes, it is a straightforward isomorphism. Then the homology of the tensor product on the right is given by the spectral K√ºnneth formula of homological algebra.See final chapter of The freeness of the chain modules means that in this geometric case it is not necessary to use any hyperhomology or total derived tensor product. There are analogues of the above statements for singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology. For sheaf cohomology on an algebraic variety, Alexander Grothendieck found six spectral sequences relating the possible hyperhomology groups of two chain complexes of sheaves and the hyperhomology groups of their tensor product. (EGA III2, Th√©or√®me 6.7.3.).  K√ºnneth theorems in generalized homology and cohomology theories  There are many generalized (or \\"extraordinary\\") homology and cohomology theories for topological spaces. K-theory and cobordism are the best-known. Unlike ordinary homology and cohomology, they typically cannot be defined using chain complexes. Thus K√ºnneth theorems can not be obtained by the above methods of homological algebra. Nevertheless, K√ºnneth theorems in just the same form have been proved in very many cases by various other methods. The first were Michael Atiyah's K√ºnneth theorem for complex K-theory and Pierre Conner and Edwin E. Floyd's result in cobordism. A general method of proof emerged, based upon a homotopical theory of modules over highly structured ring spectra. The homotopy category of such modules closely resembles the derived category in homological algebra.

Although primarily a solo project, several other musicians have recorded as part of the band such as bassist Joey Vera, drummer Mark Zonder, and guitarist Jason Anderson. Chroma Key's music is a mix of psychedelia, electronica and ambient, with detailed keyboard sounds and a slightly dark mood. History =Departure from Dream Theater and Dead Air for Radios (1994-1998) = After more than eight years with the band Moore left Dream Theater in June 1994 in pursuit of his own musical direction. By fall of 1994 Moore relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico where much of the first album, 1998's Dead Air for Radios was written and recorded. The first four songs to be recorded were: \\"Even the Waves\\", \\"S.O.S.\\", \\"On the Page\\" and \\"Mouse\\" which include excerpts of interviews conducted by Moore of people he had met in Santa Fe. Dead Air for Radios was the first release on Moore's newly formed Fight Evil Records, created specifically for Chroma Key and future releases. In response to a question of whether or not he would tour to support the release Moore explained that after three years with the material he was ready to \\"just move on\\", but stated that touring would be more likely \\"after the next album.\\" Moore denied a \\"dark\\" vibe to the album, and preferred to describe it as \\"emotional or thoughtful\\". Furthermore he went on to elaborate that the \\"result of the mood I was in during the period after I left Dream Theater and before I knew what the hell I was going to do with my life.... I don't really think of it as a dark time, but certainly a thoughtful time anyway. I think that kind of shows up on the album.\\" =You Go Now (1999-2019)= 2000's You Go Now was written and recorded in Los Angeles, right before another move to Costa Rica, where Moore lived for 3 years. In Costa Rica, he began writing and recording ideas for a new Chroma Key album, during the day producing a bi-weekly, activist, musical radio program for Radio for Peace International, a short wave station based in San Jos√©. Moore released a compilation of the program--a mix of original music and politically volatile spoken word recordings--as a downloadable album on his official site as Shines Fox1. =Graveyard Mountain Home (2003-2004)= Moore originally began work on Graveyard Mountain Home in December 2003, but postponed work on more material due to the next OSI album. By this time he had completed two new songs. Moore commented on the sound of the album stating \\"\\"The big difference with the new [Chroma Key album] is that there are more real instruments...This new Chroma Key is going to be more organic, and less digital.\\" Moore left Costa Rica at the invitation of former classmate at California Institute of the Arts, Theron Patterson to visit him in Istanbul, Turkey. After two weeks he decided to settle down and record the third Chroma Key album. Moore decided to model the album as a soundtrack to a movie. He chose to use a film within the public domain to avoid copyright issues. Searching the Prelinger Archives he happened upon social guidance film Age 13. Moore wrote music to Age 13 slowed down to half its original playback speed allowing him to compose almost an hour of music. Graveyard Mountain Home was released on November 8, 2004 by InsideOut Music. =Unofficial work= Since 2015, Moore has had a Patreon page for Chroma Key, collecting crowdfunding for song releases. Musical Style and Influences Chroma Key has been loosely described by Kevin Moore as electronic, trip hop, and pop. Moore has identified vocalists Peter Gabriel, Roger Waters and Laurie Anderson as his \\"[oldest] and most basic influences\\" and early influences as Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson as well as Jane Siberry. Moreover Moore has also recognized such varied artists, bands and composers as Lisa Germano, Pole, The Cure, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, The Way Out, Gordons and Japanese band Acid Undertones as influences to his music.

An element management system (EMS) manages one or more of a specific type of telecommunications network elements (NE). It manages functions and capabilities within each NE but does not manage the traffic between different NEs in the network. It also provides foundation to implement TMN ‚Äì layered operations support systems (OSS) architectures for better operability and meeting stringent QoS requirements. OSS Interoperability between EMS and NMS has reached great heights with the introduction of CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture).  For server appliances  A server appliance is a computing entity that delivers predefined services through an application-specific interface with no accessible operating software. In order to develop a true server appliance, the end-user must be shielded from managing the solution as a general purpose server. An element manager routinely audits the operational condition of core elements, including CPUs, power supplies and disk drives. In the event of hardware or software malfunctions, crashes, runtime errors and system boot failure, the element manager phones home and automatically generates a maintenance request. The use of standards-based mechanisms such as SNMP and Syslog ensures full integration with today's network management systems and provides a unified view of system- wide functionality. The element manager uniquely manages the software as an image and not just a collection of software parts. An element manager also includes update services that automate the process and management of delivering updates, patches and other upgrades to server appliances deployed in field, including the operating system and all related applications. The update service provides a secure phone home point for delivering encrypted manifests and patches in the field. State models for network elements (NEs) A network element state model facilitates cross domain network management and promotes a multi-vendor environment. The standard definitions and mappings allow operations systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports. Telcordia GR-1093 discusses the two primary state models in industry.GR-1093, Generic State Requirements for Network Elements (NEs), One is the Telcordia State Model, which consolidates the state models previously described in several Telcordia documents. By consolidating the models, changes and expansions to the models can be presented and can evolve in a coordinated fashion. Also, inconsistencies and redundancy may be averted. The other model is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) State Model, which is defined in International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunication (ITU-T) Rec. X.731. The state of an entity represents the current condition of availability of the underlying resource or service in the NE from the point of view of management. In the context of the Telcordia State Model, the term \\"entity\\" represents an entry in a TL1 administrative view (i.e., represents the resource or service generally identified by the Access Identifier [AID] parameter). In the context of the ISO State Model, the term \\"entity\\" means \\"managed object\\". Different types of entities (such as hardware, transport facilities, and subscriber service) have a variety of state characteristics that express the availability of their underlying resources that are specific to each entity type. However, a state model is expected to be common to a large number of types of entities. It expresses key aspects of their availability at any given time. The purpose of the state model is to indicate the availability of an entity in providing its functions and, if an entity is not available, to indicate the cause of the unavailability and what kind of activity may be taken by the manager (e.g., the OS or the craft) to make the entity available. In a specific application, only a subset of the state model may be needed. The rationale of such restrictions is not described in GR-1093. The technology or application-specific requirements document should be consulted for this information. The standard definitions and mappings allow operations systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports. To help ensure interoperability, particularly for an OS that interfaces with multiple NEs using one of the two state models, a mapping between the models may be needed. GR-1093 provides a mapping for the two models and also defines the extension to the OSI state/status attributes that is necessary to meet the telecommunications needs of the service providers.

Harda is the administrative headquarters of Harda District. History =Mughal period= During the Mughal period, Harda was a mahal in the Handia sarkar. In 1742, Marathas led by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao captured the area, and displaced the Muslim governor of the Handia sarkar. Subsequently, Harda replaced Handia as the most important town in the area, as the local Maratha amil (chief) resided at Harda. Harda was a part of the Scindia's territories. In 1801, Yashwantrao Holkar sacked Harda. Later, Harda also faced attacks from the Pindaris and the Korku tribals. =British period= In 1817, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Harda became the headquarters of John Malcolm's division. Even after the Maratha defeat ini the war, the Scindias retained control of the Harda-Handia tract. The area was ceded to the British in 1844, but the cession was completed only in 1860. The town saw disturbances during the 1857 uprising. The Deputy Magistrate, Maulvi Mazhar-ul-Jamil, helped curb the rebellion, and was rewarded with a jagir in the Damoh district. The Harda Nagar Palika was established on 18 May 1867, and the Harda tehsil was created in 1913. The British tried to bring a progressive frame work to Harda during its rule. Harda was formed by combining Kul Harda and Mehmudabad Villages. After the railway lines were laid the conditions improved, and the area developed. In 1857 British officers worked here as judges and administrative Officers. Harda was one of the largest places in the old 'Madhya Prant' and includes area of 'Seoni Malwa.' The Harda language and culture is influenced by 'Malwa' and 'Nimar'. The main dialect spoken in Harda is known as Bhuani, and the region is known as the Bhuana area which loosely translates to more fertilized land. =Indian independence movement = Guru Radha Kishan was born in 1925 in Bid village of Harda district.

He was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford.Article by K. E. Robinson. Military service and First World War Ormsby-Gore served in the Territorial Army, being commissioned a second lieutenant in the Shropshire Yeomanry in 1907Under Ormsby-Gore, William George Arthur. His sketch in the ODNB dates his commissioning in 1908. and promoted lieutenant in 1911. He was mobilized at the outbreak of the First World War and accompanied his regiment to Egypt, where he was promoted captain in 1915 and went onto the general staff. In 1916 he joined the Arab Bureau as an intelligence officer, attached to the British High Commissioner Sir Henry A. McMahon. According to the writer Scott Anderson, Ormsby-Gore by 1916 had become a convert to Judaism and was one of the primary figures in the British government who favored the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He was recalled to England in 1917 to serve as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Milner and as assistant secretary in the War Cabinet headed by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and to Sir Mark Sykes. Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, a personal friend, took refuge in Ormsby-Gore's London home while the former was in the capital for the cabinet approval of the Balfour Declaration. With Weizmann's approval, Ormsby-Gore was the British military liaison officer with the Zionist mission in the Holy Land (then lately liberated from Ottoman Turkish rule) during March to August 1918. After the armistice, he was part of the British delegation to the peace conference at Paris in 1919. Ormsby-Gore remained serving in the yeomanry after the war until 1921. In 1939 he was appointed an honorary colonel of the 10th Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Political career Harlech was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Denbigh Boroughs by a majority of eight votes at the January 1910 general election, sitting for the seat until he was selected for and won Stafford at the 1918 general election.

He served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1922 to 1929 (with a brief interruption during the short-lived Labour government of 1924). He was British representative to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations from 1921 to 1922. In the 1927 New Year Honours, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

After his resignation, he was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in the 1938 Birthday Honours. He was also a firm protester against Nazi Germany at that time. During the Second World War, he was Civil Defence Commissioner for the North- East of England and then High Commissioner to South Africa from 1941 to 1944. After retiring from politics he served on the board of Midland Bank, owner of a banking house founded by his family, and was chairman of the Bank of West Africa.

The Anglo-German Naval Agreement fixed a ratio whereby the total tonnage of the Kriegsmarine was to be 35% of the total tonnage of the Royal Navy on a permanent basis. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 July 1935.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 161, pp. 10‚Äì20. The agreement was denounced by Adolf Hitler on 28 April 1939. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was an ambitious attempt on the part of both the British and the Germans to reach better relations, but it ultimately foundered because of conflicting expectations between the two countries. For Germany, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was intended to mark the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance against France and the Soviet Union, whereas for Britain, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was to be the beginning of a series of arms limitation agreements that were made to limit German expansionism. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was controversial, both at the time and since, because the 35:100 tonnage ratio allowed Germany the right to build a Navy beyond the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles, and London had made the agreement without consulting Paris or Rome. Background Part V of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles had imposed severe restrictions on the size and capacities of Germany's armed forces. Germany was allowed no submarines, no naval aviation, and only six obsolete pre-dreadnought battleships; the total naval forces allowed to the Germans were six armored vessels of no more than 10,000 tons displacement, six light cruisers of no more than 6,000 tons displacement, twelve destroyers of no more than 800 tonnes displacement and twelve torpedo boats. Through the interwar years, German opinion had protested these restrictions as harsh and unjust, and demanded that either all the other states of Europe disarm down to German levels, or Germany be allowed to rearm to the level of all the other European states. In Britain, where after 1919 guilt was felt over what was seen as the excessively harsh terms of Versailles, the German claim to \\"equality\\" in armaments often met with considerable sympathy. More importantly, every German government of the Weimar Republic was implacably opposed to the terms of Versailles, and given that Germany was potentially Europe's strongest power, from the British perspective it made sense to revise Versailles in Germany's favour as the best way of preserving the peace. The British attitude was well summarised in a Foreign Office memo from 1935 that stated \\"... from the earliest years following the war it was our policy to eliminate those parts of the Peace Settlement which, as practical people, we knew to be unstable and indefensible\\". The change of regime in Germany in 1933 did cause alarm in London, but there was considerable uncertainty regarding Hitler's long-term intentions. In August 1933, the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID), Sir Maurice Hankey, visited Germany and wrote down his impressions of the \\"New Germany\\" in October 1933. Hankey's report concluded with the words: :\\"Are we still dealing with the Hitler of Mein Kampf, lulling his opponents to sleep with fair words to gain time to arm his people, and looking always to the day when he can throw off the mask and attack Poland? Or is it a new Hitler, who discovered the burden of responsible office, and wants to extricate himself, like many an earlier tyrant from the commitments of his irresponsible days? That is the riddle that has to be solved\\".Document 181 C10156/2293/118 \\"Notes by Sir Maurice Hankey on Hitler's External Policy in Theory and Practice October 24, 1933\\" from British Documents on Foreign Affairs Germany 1933 page 339. This uncertainty over Hitler's ultimate intentions in foreign policy were to colour much of the British policy towards Germany until 1939. London Naval Conference Equally important as one of the origins of the Treaty were the deep cuts made to the Royal Navy after the Washington Naval Conference of 1921‚Äì22 and the London Naval Conference 1930. The cuts imposed by the two conferences, combined with the effects of the Great Depression, caused the collapse of much of the British shipbuilding industry in the early 1930s. That seriously hindered efforts at British naval rearmament later in the decade, leading the Admiralty to value treaties with quantitative and qualitative limitations on potential enemies as the best way of ensuring the royal Navy's sea supremacy. Maiolo argues that it was actually of little importance whether potential enemies placed voluntary limitations on the size and scale of their navies. In particular, Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield, the First Sea Lord between 1933 and 1938, came to argue in favour of such treaties. They promised a standardised classification of different warships and discouraged technical innovations, which, under existing conditions, the Royal Navy could not always hope to match. Chatfield especially wished for the Germans to do away with their Panzerschiffe (known in the London press as \\"pocket battleships\\"), as such ships, embracing the characteristics of both battleships and cruisers, were dangerous to his vision of a world of regulated warship types and designs. As part of the effort to do away with the Panzerschiffe, the British Admiralty stated in March 1932 and again in the spring of 1933 that Germany was entitled to \\"a moral right to some relaxation of the treaty [of Versailles]\\". World Disarmament Conference In February 1932, the World Disarmament Conference opened in Geneva. Among the more hotly-debated issues at the conference was the German demand for Gleichberechtigung (\\"equality of armaments\\", abolishing Part V of Versailles) as opposed to the French demand for s√©curit√© (\\"security\\"), maintaining Part V. The British attempted to play the \\"honest broker\\" and sought to seek a compromise between the French claim to s√©curit√© and the German claim to Gleichberechtigung, which in practice meant backing the German claim to rearm beyond Part V, but not allowing the Germans to rearm enough to threaten France. Several of the British compromise proposals along these lines were rejected by both the French and German delegations as unacceptable. In September 1932, Germany walked out of the conference, claiming it was impossible to achieve Gleichberechtigung. By this time, the electoral success of the Nazis had alarmed London, and it was felt unless the Weimar Republic could achieve some dramatic foreign policy success, Hitler might come to power. In order to lure the Germans back to Geneva, after several months of strong diplomatic pressure by London on Paris, in December 1932 all the other delegations voted for a British-sponsored resolution that would allow for the \\"theoretical equality of rights in a system which would provide security for all nations\\". Germany agreed to return to the conference. Thus, before Hitler became Chancellor, it had been accepted that Germany could rearm beyond the limits set by Versailles, though the precise extent of German rearmament was still open to negotiation. Adolf Hitler During the 1920s, Hitler's thinking on foreign policy went through a dramatic change. At the beginning of his political career Hitler was hostile to the UK, considering it an enemy of the Reich. However, after the UK opposed the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, he came to rank the UK as a potential ally. In Mein Kampf, and even more in its sequel, Zweites Buch, Hitler strongly criticised the pre-1914 German government for embarking on a naval and colonial challenge to the British Empire, and in Hitler's view, needlessly antagonizing the UK. In Hitler's view, the UK was a fellow \\"Aryan\\" power, whose friendship could be won by a German \\"renunciation\\" of naval and colonial ambitions against the UK. In return for such a \\"renunciation\\", Hitler expected an Anglo-German alliance directed at France and the Soviet Union, and the UK's support for the German efforts to acquire Lebensraum in Eastern Europe. As the first step towards the Anglo-German alliance, Hitler had written in Mein Kampf of his intention to seek a \\"sea pact\\", by which Germany would \\"renounce\\" any naval challenge against the UK. Kurt von Schleicher in uniform, 1932 Erich Raeder in naval uniform, 1939 In January 1933, Hitler became the German chancellor. The new government in Germany had inherited a strong negotiating position at Geneva from the previous government of General Kurt von Schleicher. The German strategy was to make idealistic offers of limited rearmament, out of the expectation that all such offers would be rejected by the French, allowing Germany to go on ultimately with the maximum rearmament. The ultra-nationalism of the Nazi regime had alarmed the French, who put the most minimal possible interpretation of German \\"theoretical equality\\" in armaments, and thereby played into the German strategy. In October 1933, the Germans again walked out of the conference, stating that everyone else should either disarm to the Versailles level, or allow Germany to rearm beyond Versailles. Though the Germans never had any serious interest in accepting any of the UK's various compromise proposals, in London, the German walk-out was widely, if erroneously, blamed on French \\"intransigence\\". The UK Government was left with the conviction that, in the future, opportunities for arms limitation talks with the Germans should not be lost because of French \\"intransigence\\". Subsequent offers by the UK to arrange for the German return to the World Disarmament Conference were sabotaged by the Germans putting forward proposals that were meant to appeal to the UK while being unacceptable to the French. On 17 April 1934, the last such effort ended with the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou's rejection of the latest German offer as unacceptable in the so-called \\"Barthou note\\" which ended French participation in the Conference while declaring that France would look after its own security in whatever way was necessary. At the same time, Admiral Erich Raeder of the Reichsmarine persuaded Hitler of the advantages of ordering two more Panzerschiffe, and in 1933 advised the Chancellor that Germany would be best off by 1948 with a fleet of three aircraft carriers, 18 cruisers, eight Panzerschiffe, 48 destroyers and 74 U-boats. Admiral Raeder argued to Hitler that Germany needed naval parity with France as a minimum goal, whereas Hitler from April 1933 onwards, expressed a desire for a Reichsmarine of 33.3% of the total tonnage of the Royal Navy. In November 1934, the Germans formally informed the UK of their wish to reach a treaty with the UK, under which the Reichsmarine would be allowed to grow until the size of 35% of the Royal Navy. The figure was raised because the phrase of a German goal of \\"one third of the Royal Navy except in cruisers, destroyers, and submarines\\" did not sound quite right in speeches. Admiral Raeder felt that the 35:100 ratio was unacceptable towards Germany, but was overruled by Hitler who insisted on the 35:100 ratio. Aware of the German desire to expand their Navy beyond Versailles, Admiral Chatfield repeatedly advised it would be best to reach a naval treaty with Germany so as to regulate the future size and scale of the German navy. Though the Admiralty described the idea of a 35:100 tonnage ratio between London and Berlin as \\"the highest that we could accept for any European power\\", it advised the government that the earliest Germany could build a Navy to that size was 1942, and that though they would prefer a smaller tonnage ratio than 35:100, a 35:100 ratio was nonetheless acceptable. In December 1934, a study done by Captain Edward King, Director of the Royal Navy's Plans Division suggested that the most dangerous form a future German Navy might take from the UK's perspective would be a Kreuzerkrieg (Cruiser war) fleet. Captain King argued that guerre-de-course German fleet of Panzerschiffe, cruisers, and U-boats operating in task forces would be dangerous for the Royal Navy, and that a German \\"balanced fleet\\" that would be a mirror image of the Royal Navy would be the least dangerous form the German Navy could take. A German \\"balanced fleet\\" would have proportionally the same number of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc. that the UK's fleet possessed, and from the UK's point of view, this would be in the event of war, the easiest German fleet to defeat. U-boat construction Ramsay MacDonald, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1924, 1929‚Äì1931 & 1931‚Äì1935. Though every government of the Weimar Republic had violated Part V of Versailles, in 1933 and 1934, the Nazi government had become more flagrant and open in violating Part V. In 1933, the Germans started to build their first U-boats since World War I, and in April 1935, launched their first U-boats. On 25 April 1935, the UK's naval attach√© to Germany, Captain Gerard Muirhead-Gould was officially informed by Captain Leopold B√ºrkner of the Reichsmarine that Germany had laid down twelve 250 ton U-boats at Kiel. On 29 April 1935, the Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon informed the British House of Commons that Germany was now building U-boats. On 2 May 1935, the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald told the House of his government's intention to reach a naval pact to regulate the future growth of the German Navy. U-534, Birkenhead Docks, Merseyside, England In a more general sense, because of the UK's championing of German \\"theoretical equality\\" at the World Disarmament Conference, London was in a weak moral position to oppose the German violations. The German response to the UK's complaints about violations of Part V were that they were merely unilaterally exercising rights the UK's delegation at Geneva were prepared to concede to the Reich. In March 1934, a British Foreign Office memo stated \\"Part V of the Treaty of Versailles... is, for practical purposes, dead, and it would become a putrefying corpse which, if left unburied, would soon poison the political atmosphere of Europe. Moreover, if there is to be a funeral, it is clearly better to arrange it while Hitler is still in a mood to pay the undertakers for their services\\". In December 1934, a secret Cabinet committee met to discuss the situation caused by German rearmament. The UK Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon stated at one of the committee's meetings that \\"If the alternative to legalizing German rearmament was to prevent it, there would be everything to be said, for not legalizing it\\". But since London had already rejected the idea of a war to end German rearmament, the UK Government chose a diplomatic strategy that would exchange abolition of Part V in exchange for German return to both the League of Nations, and the World Disarmament Conference\\". At the same meeting, Simon stated \\"Germany would prefer, it appears, to be ‚Äòmade an honest woman'; but if she is left too long to indulge in illegitimate practices and to find by experience that she does not suffer for it, this laudable ambition may wear off\\". In January 1935, Simon wrote to George V that \\"The practical choice is between a Germany which continues to rearm without any regulation or agreement and a Germany which, through getting a recognition of its rights and some modifications of the Peace Treaties enters into the comity of nations and contributes in this or other ways to European stability. As between these two courses, there can be no doubt which is the wiser\\". In February 1935, a summit in London between the French Premier Pierre Laval and UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald led to an Anglo-French communiqu√© issued in London that proposed talks with the Germans on arms limitation, an air pact, and security pacts for Eastern Europe and the nations along the Danube. Talks In early March 1935, talks intended to discuss the scale and extent of German rearmament in Berlin between Hitler and Simon were postponed when Hitler took offence at a UK Government White Paper that justified a higher defence budget under the grounds that Germany was violating the Versailles Treaty, and he claimed to have contracted a \\"cold\\". In the interval between Hitler \\"recovering\\" and Simon's visit, the German government took the chance for formally rejecting all the clauses of Versailles relating to disarmament on the land and air. In the 1930s, the UK Government was obsessed with the idea of a German bombing attack destroying London and so placed a great deal of value on reaching an air pact outlawing bombing. The idea of a naval agreement was felt to be a useful stepping stone to an air pact. On 26 March 1935, during one of his meetings with Simon, and his deputy Anthony Eden, Hitler stated his intention to reject the naval disarmament section of Versailles but was prepared to discuss a treaty regulating the scale of German naval rearmament. On 21 May 1935, Hitler in a speech in Berlin formally offered to discuss a treaty offering a German Navy that was to operate forever on a 35:100 naval ratio. During his \\"peace speech\\" of 21 May, Hitler disavowed any intention of engaging in a pre-1914 style naval race with the UK, and he stated: \\"The German Reich government recognises of itself the overwhelming importance for existence and thereby the justification of dominance at sea to protect the British Empire, just as, on the other hand, we are determined to do everything necessary in protection of our own continental existence and freedom\\". For Hitler, his speech illustrated the quid pro quo of an Anglo-German alliance, the UK's acceptance of German mastery of Continental Europe in exchange for German acceptance of the UK's mastery over the seas. Joachim von Ribbentrop, the head of the German delegation sent to London to negotiate the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. On 22 May 1935, the British Cabinet voted for formally taking up Hitler's offers of 21 May as soon as possible. Sir Eric Phipps, the UK's ambassador in Berlin, advised London that no chance at a naval agreement with Germany should be lost \\"owing to French shortsightedness\\". Chatfield informed the Cabinet that it was most unwise to \\"oppose [Hitler's] offer, but what the reactions of the French will be to it are more uncertain and its reaction on our own battleship replacement still more so\\". On 27 March 1935, Hitler had appointed Joachim von Ribbentrop to head the German delegation to negotiate any naval treaty. Von Ribbentrop served as both Hitler's Extraordinary Ambassador‚ÄìPlenipotentiary at Large (making part of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, the German Foreign Office) and as the chief of a Nazi Party organization named the Dienststelle Ribbentrop that competed with the Ausw√§rtiges Amt. Baron Konstantin von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister, was first opposed to this arrangement, but he changed his mind when he decided that the UK would never accept the 35:100 ratio; having Ribbentrop head the mission was the best way to discredit his rival. On 2 June 1935, Ribbentrop arrived in London. The talks began on Tuesday, 4 June 1935, at the Admiralty office with Ribbentrop heading the German delegation and Simon the UK's delegation. Ribbentrop, who was determined to succeed at his mission no matter what, began his talks by stating the UK could either accept the 35:100 ratio as \\"fixed and unalterable\\" by the weekend, or the German delegation would go home, and the Germans would build their navy up to any size they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop's behaviour: \\"It is not usual to make such conditions at the beginning of negotiations\\". Simon walked out of the talks. On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the UK's delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was \\"definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler's while it is still open.... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent.... Having regard to past history and to Germany's known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it if we fail to take this chance...\\". Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office's naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office's American Department, and Ribbentrop's deputy, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would be expressed in ship tonnage, the Germans building their tonnage up to whatever the UK's tonnage was in various warship categories. On the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet's acceptance in the evening. During the next two weeks, talks continued in London on various technical issues, mostly relating to how the tonnage ratios would be calculated in the various warship categories. Ribbentrop was desperate for success and so agreed to almost all the UK's demands. On 18 June 1935, the agreement was signed in London by Ribbentrop, and the new UK Foreign Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare. Hitler called 18 June 1935, the day of the signing, \\"the happiest day of his life\\", as he believed that it marked the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance. Text \\"Exchange of Notes between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the German Government regarding the Limitation of Naval Armaments-London, 18 June 1935. (1) Sir Samuel Hoare to Herr von Ribbentrop Your Excellency, Foreign Office, June 18, 1935 During the last few days the representatives of the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been engaged in conversations, the primary purpose of which has been to prepare the way for the holding of a general conference on the subject of the limitation of naval armaments. I have now much pleasure in notifying your Excellency of the formal acceptance by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the proposal of the German Government discussed at those conversations that the future strength of the German navy in relation to the aggregate naval strength of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be in the proportion of 35:100. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard this proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe that the agreement which they have now reached with the German government, and which they regard as a permanent and definite agreement as from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of the world. 2\\\\. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom also agree with the explanations which were furnished by the German representatives in the course of the recent discussions in London as the method of application of this principle. These explanations may be summarised as follows:- (a) The ratio of 35:100 is to be a permanent relationship, i.e. the total tonnage of the German fleet shall never exceed a percentage of 35 of the aggregate tonnage of the naval forces, as defined by treaty, of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or, if there should in the future, be no treaty limitations of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. (b) If any future general treaty of naval limitation should not adopt the method of limitation by agreed ratios between the fleets of different Powers, the German Government will not insist on the incorporation of the ratio mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph in such future general treaty, provided that the method therein adopted for the future limitation of naval armaments is such as to give Germany full guarantees that this ratio can be maintained. (c) Germany will adhere to the ratio 35:100 in all circumstances, e.g. the ratio will not be affected by the construction of other Powers. If the general equilibrium of naval armaments, as normally maintained in the past, should be violently upset by any abnormal and exceptional construction by other Powers, the German Government reserve the right to invite His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to examine the new situation thus created. (d)The German Government favour, the matter of limitation of naval armaments, that system which divides naval vessels into categories, fixing the maximum tonnage and/or armament for vessels in each category, and allocates the tonnage to be allowed to each Power by categories of vessels. Consequently, in principle, and subject to (f) below, the German Government are prepared to apply the 35 per cent. ratio to the tonnage of each category of vessel to be maintained, and to make any variation of this ratio in a particular category or categories dependent on the arrangements to this end that may be arrived at in a future general treaty on naval limitation, such arrangements being based on the principle that any increase in one category would be compensated for by a corresponding reduction in others. If no general treaty on naval limitation should be concluded, or if the future general treaty should not contain provision creating limitation by categories, the manner and degree in which the German Government will have the right to vary the 35 percent. ratio in one or more categories will be a matter for settlement by agreement between the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, in the light of the naval situation then existing. (e) If, and for so long as other important naval Powers retain a single category for cruisers and destroyers, Germany shall enjoy the right to have a single category for these two classes of vessels, although she would prefer to see these classes in two categories. (f) In the matter of submarines, however, Germany, while not exceeding the ratio of 35:100 in respect of total tonnage, shall have the right to possess a submarine tonnage equal to the total submarine tonnage possessed by the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The German Government, however, undertake that, except in the circumstances indicated in the immediately following sentence, Germany's submarine tonnage shall not exceed 45 percent. of the total of that possessed by the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The German Government reserve the right, in the event of a situation arising, which in their opinion, makes it necessary for Germany to avail herself of her right to a percentage of submarine tonnage exceeding the 45 per cent. above mentioned, to give notice this effect to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and agree that the matter shall be the subject of friendly discussion before the German Government exercise that right. (g) Since it is highly improbable that the calculation of the 35 per cent. ratio should give for each category of vessels tonnage figures exactly divisible by the maximum individual tonnage permitted for ships in that category, it may be necessary that adjustments should be make in order that Germany shall not be debarred from utilising her tonnage to the full. It has consequently been agreed that the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will settle by common accord what adjustments are necessary for this purpose, and it will be understood that this procedure shall not result in any substantial or permanent departure from the ratio 35:100 in respect of total strengths. 3\\\\. With reference to sub-paragraph (c) of the explanations set out above, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have taken note of the reservation and recognise in the right therein set out, on the understanding that the 35:100 ratio will be maintained in default of agreement to the contrary between the two Governments. 4\\\\. I have the honour to request your Excellency to inform me that the German Government agrees that the proposal of the German Government has been correctly set out in the preceding paragraphs of this note. I have. & c. SAMUEL HOARE \\\\---- (2) (Translation) Herr von Ribbentrop to Sir Samuel Hoare Your Excellency, London, June 18, 1935 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's note of to-day's date, in which you were so good as to communicate to me on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom the following:- (Here follows a German translation of paragraphs 1 to 3 of No. 1.) I have the honour to confirm to your Excellency that the proposal of the German Government is correctly set forth in the foregoing note, and I note with pleasure that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom accept this proposal. The German Government, for their part, are also of the opinion that the agreement at which they have now arrived with His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and which they regard as a permanent and definite agreement with effect from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on this question between all the naval Powers of the world. I have, & c. JOACHIM VON RIBBENTROP, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Germany\\".Document 121 [A5462/22/45] from British Documents on Foreign Affairs Series 5, Volume 46 Germany 1935 edited by Jeremy Noakes, London: Public Record Office, 1994 pages 181‚Äì183. French reaction The Naval Pact was signed in London on 18 June 1935 without the UK Government consulting with France and Italy, or, later, informing them of the secret agreements which stipulated that the Germans could build in certain categories more powerful warships than any of the three Western nations then possessed. The French regarded this as treachery. They saw it as a further appeasement of Hitler, whose appetite grew on concessions. Also, they resented that the UK's agreement had for private gain further weakened the peace treaty, thus adding to the growing overall military power of Germany. The French contended that the UK had no legal right to absolve Germany from respecting the naval clauses of the Versailles Treaty. As an additional insult for France, the Naval Pact was signed on the 120th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, at which British and Prussian troops defeated the French army of Napoleon.  Impact  Lord Halifax with Hermann G√∂ring at Schorfheide, Germany, 20 November 1937. Because of the lengthy period needed to construct warships and the short duration of the agreement its impact was limited. It was estimated by both German and British naval experts that the earliest year that Germany could reach the 35% limit was 1942. In practice, lack of shipbuilding space, design problems, shortages of skilled workers, and the scarcity of foreign exchange to purchase necessary raw materials slowed the rebuilding of the German Navy. A lack of steel and non-ferrous metals caused by the Kriegsmarine being third in terms of German rearmament priorities, behind the Heer and the Luftwaffe, led to the Kriegsmarine (as the German Navy had been renamed in 1935) being still far from the 35% limit when Hitler denounced the agreement in 1939. The requirement for the Kriegsmarine to divide its 35% tonnage ratio by warship categories had the effect of forcing the Germans to build a symmetrical \\"balanced fleet\\" shipbuilding program that reflected the UK's priorities. Since the Royal Navy's leadership thought that the \\"balanced fleet\\" would be the easiest German fleet to defeat and a German guerre-de-course fleet the most dangerous, the agreement brought the UK considerable strategic benefits. Above all, since the Royal Navy did not build \\"pocket battleships\\", Chatfield valued the end of the Panzerschiff building. When the Kriegsmarine began planning for a war with the UK in May 1938, the Kriegsmarine's senior operations officer, Commander Hellmuth Heye, concluded the best strategy for the Kriegsmarine was a Kreuzerkrieg fleet of U-boats, light cruisers and Panzerschiff operating in tandem. He was critical of the existing building priorities dictated by the agreement since there was no realistic possibility of a German \\"balanced fleet\\" defeating the Royal Navy. In response, senior German naval officers started to advocate a switch to a Kreuzerkrieg type fleet that would pursue a guerre-de-course strategy of attacking the British Merchant Marine, but they were overruled by Hitler, who insisted on the prestige of Germany building a \\"balanced fleet\\". Such a fleet would attempt a Mahanian strategy of winning maritime supremacy by a decisive battle with the Royal Navy in the North Sea. Historians such as Joseph Maiolo, Geoffrey Till and the authors of the Kriegsmarine Official History have agreed with Chatfield's contention that a Kreuzerkrieg fleet offered Germany the best chance for damaging the UK's power and that the UK benefited strategically by ensuring that such a fleet was not built in the 1930s. Nevile Henderson leaves for Berlin, Croydon Airport, August 1939 In the field of Anglo-German relations, the agreement had considerable importance. The UK expressed hope, as Craigie informed Ribbentrop, that it \\"was designed to facilitate further agreements within a wider framework and there was no further thought behind it\\". In addition, the UK viewed it as a \\"yardstick\\" for measuring German intentions towards the UK. Hitler regarded it as marking the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance and was much annoyed when this did not result. By 1937, Hitler started to increase both the sums of Reichmarks and raw materials to the Kriegsmarine, reflecting the increasing conviction that if war came, the UK would be an enemy, not an ally, of Germany. In December 1937, Hitler ordered the Kriegsmarine to start laying down six 16-inch gun battleships. At his meeting with Lord Halifax in November 1937, Hitler stated that the agreement was the only item in the field of Anglo-German relations that had not been \\"wrecked\\". By 1938, the only use the Germans had for the agreement was to threaten to renounce it as a way of pressuring London to accept Continental Europe as Germany's rightful sphere of influence. At a meeting on 16 April 1938 between Sir Nevile Henderson, the UK's ambassador to Germany, and Hermann G√∂ring, the latter stated it had never been valued in England, and he bitterly regretted that Herr Hitler had ever consented to it at the time without getting anything in exchange. It had been a mistake, but Germany was nevertheless not going to remain in a state of inferiority in this respect vis-√†-vis a hostile UK, and would build up to a 100 per cent basis. In response to G√∂ring's statement, a joint Admiralty-Foreign Office note was sent to Henderson to inform him that he should inform the Germans: > \\"Field Marshal G√∂ring's threat that in certain circumstances Germany might, > presumably after denouncing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, > proceed to build up to 100% of the British fleet is clearly bluff [emphasis > in the original]. In view of the great existing disparities in the size of > the two navies this threat could only be executed if British construction > were to remain stationary over a considerable period of years whilst German > tonnage was built up to it. This would not occur. Although Germany is > doubtless capable of realizing the 35% figure by 1942 if she so desires, or > even appreciably earlier, it seems unlikely (considering her difficulties in > connection with raw material, foreign exchange and the necessity of giving > priority to her vast rearmament on land and in the air, and considering our > own big programme) that she would appreciably exceed that figure during the > next few years.

Munich agreement and denunciation Chamberlain (left) and Hitler leave the Bad Godesberg meeting, 23 September 1938. After the summit, the UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned to home where he declared that the Munich agreement meant \\"peace for our time\\" At the conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement in September 1938, Hitler informed Neville Chamberlain that if the UK's policy was \\"to make it clear in certain circumstances\\" that the UK might be intervening in a mainland European war, the political preconditions for the agreement no longer existed, and Germany should denounce it. This led to Chamberlain including mention of it in the Anglo-German Declaration of 30 September 1938. Tirpitz sliding down the slipway at her launch By the late 1930s, Hitler's disillusionment with the UK's led to German foreign policy taking increasing anti-UK course. An important sign of Hitler's changed perceptions about the UK was his decision in January 1939 to give first priority to the Kriegsmarine in allocations of money, skilled workers and raw materials and to launch Plan Z to build a colossal Kriegsmarine of 10 battleships, 16 \\"pocket battleships\\", 8 aircraft carriers, 5 heavy cruisers, 36 light cruisers and 249 U-boats by 1944 purposed to crush the Royal Navy. Since the fleet envisioned in the Z Plan was considerably larger than allowed by the 35:100 ratio in the agreement, it was inevitable that Germany would renounce it. Over the winter of 1938‚Äì39, it became clearer to London that the Germans no longer intended to abide by the agreement, which played a role in straining Anglo-German relations. Reports received in October 1938 that the Germans were considering denouncing the agreement were used by Halifax in Cabinet discussions for the need for a tougher policy with the Reich. The German statement of 9 December 1938 of intending to build to 100% ratio allowed in submarines by the agreement and to the limits in heavy cruisers led to a speech by Chamberlain before the correspondents of the German News Agency in London that warned of the \\"futility of ambition, if ambition leads to the desire for domination\\". At the same time, Halifax informed Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the UK, that his government viewed the talks to discuss the details of the German building escalation as a test case for German sincerity. When the talks began in Berlin on 30 December 1938, the Germans took an obdurate approach, leading London to conclude that the Germans did not wish for the talks to succeed. In response to the UK's \\"guarantee\\" of Poland of 31 March 1939, Hitler, enraged by the UK's move proclaimed \\"I shall brew them a devil's drink\\". In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz, Hitler threatened to denounce the agreement if the UK persisted with its \\"encirclement\\" policy, as represented by the \\"guarantee\\" of Polish independence. On 28 April 1939, Hitler denounced the AGNA. To provide an excuse for its denunciation of and to prevent the emergence of a new naval treaty, the Germans began refusing to share information about their shipbuilding, leaving the UK with the choice of either accepting the unilateral German move or rejecting it, thus providing the Germans with the excuse to denounce the treaty. At a Cabinet meeting on 3 May 1939, the First Lord of Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that \\"at the present time Germany was building ships as fast as she could but that she would not be able to exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943\\". Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had \\"persuaded himself\\" that the UK had provided the Reich with a \\"free hand\\" in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that the UK had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the F√ºhrer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated \\"that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated\\". In the end, the UK's reply to the German move was a diplomatic note, strongly disputing the German claim that the UK was attempting to \\"encircle\\" Germany with hostile alliances. The German denunciation and reports of increased German shipbuilding in June 1939 caused by the Z Plan played a significant part in persuading the Chamberlain government of the need to \\"contain\\" Germany by building a \\"Peace front\\" of states in both Western and Eastern Europe and raised the perception in the Chamberlain government in 1939 that German policies were a threat to the UK.

He robs a coach and takes a necklace but finds that the coach contains Lady Fayre and her ward Melinda. They soon meet at Huntersmoon, and he falls in love with Melinda. He dies in Melinda's arms after being shot in another highway robbery gone wrong, telling Melinda that they will find each other again in another life, and leaving Lydia pregnant. Huntersmoon devolves to William and some unhappy ghosts. ;Act II More than three decades later, in the early Victorian era, William's son, Valentine Fayre, owns Huntersmoon. He is a composer to Queen Victoria. He marries Veronica Lyddington, the illegitimate daughter of the late Sir Graham and Lydia. They live amidst the ghosts of their predecessors. Valentine meets Melanie, Sir Graham's niece; they fall in love and plan to run away together, but Veronica reveals that she is pregnant. Valentine is in despair when Melanie commits suicide. ;Act III In 1945, Valentine's grandson, Bay Fayre, wins the hand of Melody, the girl who represents the love that he had lost in earlier generations.

Establishing a garden using plug plants is often easier than doing so starting from seed. . According to the American National Standards a plug is a cylinder of medium in which a plant is grown. The term is generally used to describe seedlings and rooted cuttings which have been removed from the container but with the medium held intact by the roots https://cdn.ymaws.com/americanhort.site- ym.com/resource/collection/38ED7535-9C88-45E5-AF44-01C26838AD0C/ANSI_Nursery_Stock_Standards_AmericanHort_2014.pdf. Overview Plugs growing in a greenhouse at New Place Nurseries in Pulborough, West Sussex, England Planting from plugs reduces the time a crop resides in the ground, and is functional for those with limited space. Plugs can improve yields: a healthy, stocky plant will grow rapidly and symmetrically when planted out, with a potentially greater capacity to withstand pests, disease and drought. Raising some types of seedlings successfully can be difficult, so plug plants can be beneficial for less experienced gardeners. Plug plants are beneficial for gardeners who want to try a new variety or a range of varieties without purchasing numerous packets of seeds and starting the plants from seed. Plug plants are very useful if the sowing window is missed, and plugs can be purchased quickly to replace a crop which has failed. As a garden develops, interplanting (intercropping) existing crops with plugs plants, ideally companion plants, can improve the productivity of the space and so maximise harvestsa sown crop may not be able to compete with established plants. Plug plants are much easier to weed than sown seedlings, and weeding will need to be done less frequently. Having semi- grown plants simplifies designing a vegetable plot or container. As plants that have already started growth, the time to attain plant growth is lessened. Within days of planting signs of growth are typically visible: leaves will perk up and roots anchor into the soil. Air pruned plugs are grown in a manner to promote very rapid growth almost immediately after being transplanted to new soil. Plugs are sometimes used in hillside plasticulture applications, due to the ease in which they are transplanted. Plant cultivation and growth A plug of St. Augustine grass ready for sprigging Plug plants grow more consistently, as has been noted by the commercial scale vegetable growing industry, and more rapidly; large-scale brassica field crops are planted almost exclusively from soil block plugs in some parts of Europe, a trend which is growing in the UK. This success at the commercial scale is testament to the success of plugs in the ground. It is of note that many varieties actively benefit from being transplanted as severing the taproot encourages bushier root growth. Traditionally nearly all heading brassica are sown in a separate seed bed, thinned, and the best ones planted in a prepared bed after about 6‚Äì8 weeks. Many pests want to eat baby brassica; this in combination with its long growing season makes planting brassica from plugs a much easier option. Root vegetables Root vegetables are typically, but not always, sown from seed, rather than transplanted from plugs, where they are to mature and then be thinned. The thinning action is highly beneficial in itself as it provides soil aeration at depth without disturbing adjacent roots systems. The initial concentration of seedlings also dilutes damage from pests and provided some food for the gardener or the compost in the form of thinnings. Beetroot, carrots and the root brassica family- swede, turnip- will simply not reach their full potential with any check to early root growth. In addition, these seeds are typically inexpensive, and the seedlings are delicate; hence there is little value to the gardener in buying or growing them as plugs.

Brigadier Sir Henry Cecil John Hunt, Baron Hunt, (22 June 1910 ‚Äì 7 November 1998) was a British Army officer who is best known as the leader of the successful 1953 British Expedition to Mount Everest. Early life and military career Hunt was born in Simla, British India on 22 June 1910, the son of Captain Cecil Edwin Hunt of the Indian Army, and a great-great-nephew of the explorer Sir Richard Burton.Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland (1912 edn): BURTON of Carrigaholt Castle His father was killed in action during the First World War. Hunt, from the age of 10, spent much holiday time in the Alps, learning some of the mountaineering skills he would later hone while taking part in several expeditions in the Himalayas while serving in India. He made a guided ascent of Piz Palu at 14. He was educated at Marlborough College before entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was awarded the King's Gold Medal and the Anson Memorial Sword. After Sandhurst, Hunt was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 30 January 1930. Among his fellow graduates were Charles Harington and Alan Brown. In 1931, the regiment was posted to India. He was promoted lieutenant in 1933. Despite his background he seems not to have been entirely comfortable with the prevailing social climate of the Raj. He preferred rugby to polo, and having already gained fluency in German and French he added Urdu and some Bengali. In 1934 he became a Military Intelligence officer in the Indian Army, with the local rank of captain, and was seconded to the Indian Police. At this time the Indian independence movement was gaining ground, and Bengal was particularly affected. Hunt even worked undercover, gathering intelligence in Chittagong while dressed in local clothing. He returned to his regiment in 1935, having been awarded the Indian Police Medal. Throughout this period Hunt continued to climb in the Himalayas. In 1935, with James Waller's group, he attempted Saltoro Kangri, reaching . This exploit led to his election to the Alpine Club and the Royal Geographical Society. He applied to join the 1936 Everest Expedition, but was turned down when an RAF medical discovered a minor heart problem. A heart murmur. He was advised not to climb stairs! He married Joy Mowbray-Green on 3 September 1936, and she also took part (along with Reggie Cooke), in Hunt's 1937 Himalayan trip which included reconnaissance of Kangchenjunga, the south-western summit of Nepal Peak, and only the third ascent of the Zemu Gap, between Kangchenjunga and Simvo. Here they saw tracks that one of the party's Sherpas told them were those of the Yeti. In 1938 he returned for a further period of secondment in Military Intelligence, being promoted substantive captain. Second World War Upon returning to the United Kingdom in 1940, Hunt became chief instructor at the Commando Mountain and Snow Warfare School, Braemar. He returned to regimental duty in 1943 as a war substantive major and acting lieutenant colonel, Commanding Officer (CO) of the 11th Battalion of the KRRC. Forming the motorized infantry element of the 23rd Armoured Brigade, Hunt led the battalion in the Italian Campaign. In 1944, Hunt received an immediate award of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership in bitter fighting on the River Sangro, in addition to his battalion, he commanded attached troops from other arms, and the recommendation for his DSO states that he was constantly in the forefront of the fighting, organising raids and ambushes to keep the enemy forces on the back foot, and himself leading reconnaissance patrols deep behind enemy lines.Piece details WO 373/7, The National Archives contains the recommendation for the DSO, which can be downloaded (fee payable) from Documents Online, Image details‚ÄîHunt, Henry Cecil John. Retrieved 8 April 2008. In October 1944 his battalion was transferred to Greece, just as the tensions that would lead to the Greek Civil War were becoming evident. In Greece Hunt was appointed temporary brigadier and given command of the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Indian Infantry Division, at Patras. He described attempting to keep the peace between the various factions as \\"the most tense and difficult period in all my experience, before or since\\". For his efforts there Hunt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in June 1945. In contrast to Italy, he was ordered not to take the initiative and had to cope with large hostile forces threatening him, and infiltration by armed civilians as well as increasing numbers of insults to his troops. Hunt kept the situation calm, and when finally allowed to act, and reinforced he planned and executed a successful operation.Piece details WO 373/75, the National Archives contains the citation for the CBE, which can be downloaded (fee payable) from Documents Online, Image details‚ÄîHunt, Henry Cecil John. Retrieved 8 April 2008. He then attended the Staff College, Camberley in 1946, followed by various staff appointments in the Middle East and Europe. He was granted the substantive rank of major in 1946, becoming substantive colonel in 1952. Mount Everest Hunt was employed on the staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) when he received the surprise invitation to lead the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition. It had been expected that Eric Shipton would lead the expedition, as he had led the (unsuccessful) British attempt on Cho Oyu the previous year from which the majority of the climbers were drawn. However, the Joint Himalayan Committee of the Alpine Club and Royal Geographical Society that oversaw British attempts on Everest decided that Hunt's military leadership experience and undoubted climbing credentials would provide the best hope for success. It was felt to be critical that this expedition should be successful as the French had permission to mount an expedition in 1954 and the Swiss in 1955, meaning that the British would not have another opportunity until 1956 at the earliest. Many members of the expedition felt a strong loyalty to Shipton, and were unhappy with his replacement. Edmund Hillary was one of those most opposed to the change, but was soon won round by Hunt's personality and frank admission that the change had been badly handled. Hunt planned for three assaults of two climbers each including \\"a third and last attempt\\" if necessary, although after two consecutive assaults a wait would be necessary to \\"recover our strength\\" and to replenish the camps. Base Camp was established on 12 April 1953. The next few days were taken up with establishing a route through the Khumbu Icefall, and once opened, teams of Sherpas moved tons of supplies up the mountain. A succession of advanced camps were created, slowly forging higher up the mountain. By 21 May, Wilfrid Noyce and Annullu had reached the psychological milestone of the South Col. Hunt had selected two climbing pairs to attempt the summit. The first pair (Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans) set out on 26 May but were forced to turn back after becoming exhausted high on the mountain. On the same day Hunt himself climbed to with Da Namgyal Sherpa to leave a cache of equipment on the Southeast Ridge for the second summit party. On 28 May, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair. The summit was eventually reached at 11:30 am on 29 May 1953 by the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal (Norgay had previously ascended to a record mark on Everest with a Swiss expedition of 1952). News of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. Returning to Kathmandu a few days later, they discovered that Hillary had been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor for their efforts. He received his knighthood on his return to London in July 1953. Further honours were showered on Hunt and the expedition team: the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society, the first time the medal was awarded on a collective basis, though individual bronze replicas were made for Hunt, Hillary and Norgay; the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society; the Lawrence medal of the Royal Central Asian Society; and honorary degrees from Aberdeen, Durham, and London universities. Later life Brigadier Sir John Hunt pictured in the Caucasus, 1958 Hunt returned to active duty in the Army, being posted as assistant commandant of Sandhurst. Following his retirement from military service in 1956, when he was granted the honorary rank of brigadier, he became the first Director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, a post he held for ten years. He left an account of the British Caucasus Expedition in 1958.Sir John Hunt and Christopher Brasher The red snows : an account of the British Caucasus Expedition 1958. London : Hutchinson, 1960 175 p. In the 1966 Queen's Birthday Honours he was created a Life Peer for his work with young people, his title being gazetted as Baron Hunt, of Llanfair Waterdine in Shropshire. He was also the first Chairman of the Parole Board, and his advisory work on policing in Northern Ireland led to the Hunt Report with its recommendation for the disbanding of the B-Specials and creation of a purely military reserve force, which was created as the Ulster Defence Regiment. In 1974 he was appointed to the Royal Commission on the Press. He was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1979.

First displayed to the public at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1965, the 2000GT was manufactured under contract by Yamaha between 1967 and 1970. A halo car for the automaker, in Japan it was exclusive to Toyota's Japanese retail sales channel called Toyota Store. The 2000GT revolutionized the automotive world's view of Japan, then viewed as a producer of imitative and stodgily practical vehicles. As a sleek, high-performance fastback, it demonstrated its auto makers could produce a sports car to rival the better marques of Europe. Reviewing a pre-production 2000GT in 1967, Road & Track magazine summed up the car as \\"one of the most exciting and enjoyable cars we've driven\\", and compared it favorably to the Porsche 911. Today, the 2000GT is seen as the first seriously collectible Japanese car and its first supercar. Examples of the 2000GT have sold at auction for as much as .  Background  Automobile ownership in Japan during the late 1950's and early 1960's began to pickup, and Toyota noticed that most international manufacturers had a top level sports car or grand touring coupe, that would draw customers into showrooms and dealerships and drive sales of other more affordable models. Ford had recently introduced the Thunderbird, while GM's Chevrolet Division had the Corvette. In Europe, Mercedes-Benz had the 300SL, BMW briefly offered the 507, Porsche had the 356, Jaguar had the E-Type, Aston Martin had the DB4, Ferrari had the 250 GT Coup√©, and Maserati had the 3500 GT. In Japan, Nissan offered the Datsun Sports, while Honda introduced the S500 and Prince offered the Skyline Sport Coup√©. Toyota had already began production of the Sports 800, but the engine was far too small to be considered a world class sports car, and decided they needed to offer a proper 6-cylinder coupe. Most of the 2000GT's design was done by motorcycle manufacturer Yamaha, who also contributed contract assistance for other Japanese manufacturers, including Nissan. In 1959, Yamaha established the Technical Research Institute to develop their own sports car, and had built the YX30 sports car with a 4-cylinder engine displacing 1600cc, having drawn inspiration from the British MGA B-Series 1600 DOHC engine.„ÅÑ„Å§„ÅÆÊó•„ÇÇÈÅ†„Åè Á¨¨‰∫åÁ´† ÂõõËº™Ëá™ÂãïËªä„ÅÆÊó•„ÄÖ Due to various problems, Yamaha senior management decided to close the research facility in 1962, but enthusiasm of developing a sports car led to them partnering with an established auto manufacturer. A prototype called the \\"A550X\\" was built, but Nissan cancelled the project and introduced the slow selling Nissan Silvia coupe in 1965.„ÄåAÔΩûX„Äç„Å®Ë®Ä„ÅÜÂëºÁß∞„ÅØÊó•Áî£Ëá™ÂãïËªä„ÅÆ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÂæå‰∏ñ„Å´„ÇÇ„ÄåYX„Äç„ÅßÂßã„Åæ„Çã„É§„Éû„ÉèÂÅ¥„ÅÆÈñãÁô∫„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„ÅØË¶ã„Çâ„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÇA550X„ÇÇ2000GT„ÇÇ„ÄÅÂÖ±ÈÄö„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„ÅÆ„ÅØ„É™„Éà„É©„ÇØ„Çø„Éñ„É´„Éò„ÉÉ„Éâ„É©„É≥„Éó„ÇíÊåÅ„Å§„Éï„Ç°„Çπ„Éà„Éê„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÇØ„Éº„Éö„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„ÅÆ„Åø„Åß„ÄÅËªä‰ΩìÊßãÈÄ†ÁöÑ„Å´„ÅØÂÖ®„ÅèÁï∞„Å™„Çã„ÄÇ„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„É≥„ÇÇ„ÄÅA550X„ÅØ„É§„Éû„ÉèÁô∫ÂãïÊ©ü„ÅåÁ±≥ÂõΩ„ÅÆËà™Á©∫Ê©ü„É°„Éº„Ç´„Éº„Åã„ÇâÁâπË®±„ÇíË≥ºÂÖ•„Åó„Å¶ÈñãÁô∫„Åó„Åü„Çø„Ç§„Çπ„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„É≥ÔºàÂÖ®Ê∫∂Êé•Ë£Ω„Éñ„É≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÇíÊåÅ„Å§DOHC4Ê∞óÁ≠í„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„É≥Ôºâ„Çí„É§„Éû„ÉèÁô∫ÂãïÊ©ü„ÅåÁã¨Ëá™„Å´ÊîπËâØ„Åó„ÅüYX80Âûã„ÇíÊê≠Ëºâ„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åü„ÅÆ„Å´ÂØæ„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅ2000GT„ÅØ„ÇØ„É©„Ç¶„É≥„ÅÆMÂûãÔºàSOHC 6Ê∞óÁ≠íÔºâ„Å´„Éà„É®„Çø„Å®„É§„Éû„ÉèÁô∫ÂãïÊ©ü„ÅåÂÖ±ÂêåÈñãÁô∫„Åó„ÅüDOHC„Éò„ÉÉ„Éâ„ÇíÁµÑ„ÅøÂêà„Çè„Åõ„Åü3MÂûã„ÇíÊê≠Ëºâ„Åó„Å¶„Åä„Çä„ÄÅÂÖ®„ÅèÁõ∏ÈÅï„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åü„ÄÇ Yamaha then proposed the design to Toyota, for whom they also did contract work, then perceived as the most conservative of the Japanese car manufacturers. Wishing to improve their image, Toyota accepted the proposal, but employed a design from their own designer Satoru Nozaki.  Styling  Toyota 2000GT from rear The 2000GT incorporated many classic 1960s gran turismo design elements. Nozaki's styling was inspired by the E-type Jaguar. Its smoothly flowing bodywork was executed in aluminium and featured pop-up headlights above large plexiglass covered driving lamps flanking the grille similar to those on the Toyota Sports 800. Bumpers were minimal, and the car was extremely low, just 116 cm (45.7 in) to the highest point of the roof. Despite a custom open-top version built for the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, a factory-produced convertible was never offered. Toyota 2000GT dashboard The interior offered comfortable, if cramped, accommodation and luxury touches such as a walnut or rosewood veneer dashboard inlays provided by Yamaha's musical instrument woodworking facilities, and an auto-signal seeking radio tuner. Road & Track was impressed, considering the interior suited to a \\"luxurious GT\\" and calling the 2000GT an impressive car \\"in which to sit or ride - or simply admire.\\" Facelift model of Toyota 2000GT In August 1969, the front was modified slightly, making the driving lamps smaller and changing the shape of the turn signals. The rear turn signals were enlarged at the same time, and some alterations were made to modernise the interior. The last few vehicles were fitted with air conditioning and had automatic transmission as an option. These cars had an additional scoop fitted underneath the grille to supply air to the A/C unit. Drivetrain The 3M DOHC 2.0 liter inline six was the 2000GT's main engine Only nine special models were fitted with the larger but less powerful 2M SOHC 2.3 liter inline six The engine was a longitudinally mounted straight-6 (the 3M) based on the engine in the top-of-the-line Toyota Crown sedan. It was transformed by Yamaha into a sports car engine by coupling three 2-barrel Mikuni-Solex 40 PHH carburetors to a new DOHC head that produced at 6,600 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. Nine special MF-12 models were also built with the larger but lower output SOHC 2.3 L 2M-B engine, which produced at 5,800 rpm and at 3,800 rpm of torque. Fitted with a five-speed manual transmission, the rear wheel drive car was available with three different final drives. A 4.375 ratio axle car was claimed to be capable of reaching 135 mph (217 km/h) and achieve . Both a limited slip differential and all-round power-assisted disc brake, a first for a Japanese car, were standard. The suspension was coil springs attached to double wishbones at all four wheels. It was also the first Toyota to offer rack and pinion steering as Toyota wanted to establish that this was a world class sports car. The dashboard mounted emergency brake gripped the rear discs directly should the primary braking system fail.  Production  Only 351 regular production units of the 2000GT were built, figures comparable to contemporary elite Italian supercars.The first prototype was built August 1965, only 11 months after the project had begun. Taking two years for production vehicles to finally emerge, a total of 233 MF10s, 109 MF10Ls, and nine MF12Ls were built at the Yamaha factory in Iwata, Shizuoka according to Toyota and Yamaha data starting in May 1967 until August of 1970. In America, the 2000GT sold for about $6,800, much more than contemporary Porsches and Jaguars. In terms of sales, Toyota didn't sell very many which led to the cancellation in 1970, while it did inspire the company to introduce performance oriented \\"sporty\\" coupes that followed in the 1970s. As a ‚Äúhalo car‚Äù for Toyota, it is believed that no profit was made on the 2000GT despite its high price. About 60 units reached North America and the others were similarly thinly spread worldwide. Most 2000GTs were painted either Solar Red or Pegasus White, while other colors were offered such as Thunder Silver metallic, Bellatrix Yellow, Atlantis Green, and Twilight Turquoise metallic. Yamaha and Toyota also collaborated on another more affordable production car, again using a Toyota engine block while Yamaha developed the DOHC cylinder head, and introduced the Toyota 1600GT, using a 1967 Corona 2-door hardtop coupe. When production of the 2000GT ended, and Toyota had established a reputation of making performance oriented cars, the Celica was exclusively introduced at Toyota Corolla Store locations as the top model, again offering a 2.0L DOHC engine with a manual transmission but more affordably priced. Toyota also introduced sport coupes at each of their sales distribution networks, using the same technology in a 2-door coupe with an OHC 4-cylinder engine and a fun-to-drive approach to each car. May 1967 was also the same time the Mazda Cosmo was also introduced. Lessons learned by Toyota and Yamaha led to the development of the Toyota 7, which was designed primarily for use in FIA Group 7 competition. It was Toyota's first purpose-built racing car.  Racing  Toyota entered the 2000GT in competition at home, coming third in the 1966 Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji. The 2000GT took its first win in the inaugural Suzuka 1000 Kilometres in 1966, and went on to win the 24 Hours of Fuji and the Fuji 1000 Kilometres in 1967. In addition, the car set thirteen FIA world records for speed and endurance in a 72-hour test at the Yatabe High Speed Test Track in 1966. Unfortunately, the record car was destroyed in a pace car accident and eventually scrapped. These records shortly prompted Porsche to prepare a 911R especially to beat this record. Carroll Shelby also entered a pair of 2000GTs to compete in the 1968 SCCA production car races in the CP category. Initially Shelby built three cars, including one spare. Although it performed well, it was the only season the car competed in the US. Toyota took back one of the cars and rebuilt it into a replica of their record car, which still resides in Japan. The two remaining Shelby cars remain in the United States.  2000GT Open-Top, the \\"Bond Model\\"  2000GT used in the James Bond film You Only Live Twice The 2000GT made its most famous screen appearance in the 1967 James Bond movie You Only Live Twice, most of which was filmed in Japan. Two one-off topless models - fitted only with tonneau covers to simulate functioning convertible roofs - were made specially for the film. It is claimed a targa had been considered to accommodate the burly 6' 2\\" Sean Connery. This retained the original car's fastback profile but eliminated rear side windows. Purportedly, Connery's head stuck out of the top and a roofless version was fabricated in less than two weeks for the movie. The car was only driven by \\"Bond girl\\" Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi) in the film. Bond actor Daniel Craig voted the 2000GT as his favourite Bond car of all time. Using the 2000GT in the Bond Film was a very successful example of product placement, after the world had just watched the 1964 Summer Olympics televised live by satellite and in color from Tokyo. Audiences wondered who built the car that raced through the streets of Tokyo, and once it was learned it was built by Toyota, visits to local dealerships increased, hoping to get a look at the car in person. The movie had its world premiere in London 12 June 1967, and the car had only been introduced less than a month earlier in May. The director of the film Lewis Gilbert had originally intended to use another all-new car that had just been introduced, the Chevrolet Camaro, but his friend Yukio \\"Sachio\\" Fukuzawa, a Japanese race car driver and under contract to race Toyotas, convinced Lewis that a Japanese car should be used for a film taking place in Japan.

Although he is best known to television audiences as Palmer Cortlandt on the soap opera All My Children (1979‚Äì2010), theatre and dance historians remember him as one of Agnes de Mille's leading dancers. Mitchell's skill at combining dance and acting was considered something of a novelty; in 1959, the critic Olga Maynard singled him out as \\"an important example of the new dancer-actor-singer in American ballet\\", pointing to his interpretive abilities and \\"masculine\\" technique.Olga Maynard, The American Ballet (Philadelphia: Macrae Smith, 1959), 149. Early life Mitchell was born on Leap Day, 1920 in Sacramento, California. His parents emigrated from England to Northern California, where they operated a fruit farm in Turlock. In 1923, Mitchell's mother, Edith, left his father and returned to England with Mitchell's brother and sister; she and Mitchell had no further contact. Unable to run a farm while single-handedly raising his remaining son, Mitchell's father fostered him out for several years to vaudevillians Gene and Katherine King. After Mitchell's mother died, however, his father remarried and brought both of his sons, but not his daughter, back to Turlock. At age seventeen, Mitchell left Turlock for Los Angeles, where he remained close to the Kings.Early life: virtually identical accounts with more or less detail in Meredith Brown, \\"James Mitchell: Dancing His Way into Your Heart,\\" Soap Opera Digest 5.17 (October 28, 1980): 40-41; Robert Schork, \\"Flying High,\\" Soap Opera Magazine 7.45 (18 November 1997): 21-23; \\"Rebecca Herbst & James Mitchell,\\" Soapography (aired September 2, 2006). Stage and film career While studying drama at Los Angeles City College, Mitchell was introduced to modern dance at the school of the famed teacher and choreographer, Lester Horton. After receiving his associate degree, he joined Horton's company, where he remained for nearly four years. While working with Horton, he became a close friend of dancer Bella Lewitzky; in the 1970s, he became President of the Board of Directors of her Dance Foundation, and afterwards remained a \\"major longtime [‚Ä¶] supporter\\" of hers. In 1944, Horton took Mitchell to New York with him to form a new dance company, but the venture abruptly collapsed. As it happened, the failure of Horton's company was a significant turning point in Mitchell's career: while struggling to find either acting or dancing roles in New York, he successfully auditioned for Agnes de Mille, who was choreographing her first musical since Oklahoma!. Mitchell, who did not study ballet until he was in his mid- twenties,Saul Goodman, \\"Brief Biographies: James Mitchell,\\" Dance Magazine 29.8 (August 1955): 36. was at a loss when faced with de Mille's ballet combination. Much later, describing his approach to the audition, he said, \\"Well, I really hadn't too much familiarity with that but I threw myself across the floor and about the third or fourth pass, Agnes cried 'Stop' and summoned me over and said 'Where on earth did you get your dance training?'\\".James Mitchell, \\"Dance Magazine Awards 1978\\", Dance Magazine 52.7 (July 1978): 79. Transcript. De Mille nevertheless offered him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer. Given the option between touring with Helen Hayes and dancing for de Mille, he chose de Mille.Michael Portantiere, \\"From the Scrapbook of James Mitchell\\", In Theater 87 (24 May 1999): p. 30. Bloomer Girl (1944) began an important artistic partnership with de Mille that lasted from 1944 to 1969 and spanned theater, film, television, and concert dance. De Mille's biographer, Carol Easton, describes him as the \\"quintessential male de Mille dancer\\" and de Mille's \\"closest confidant\\" in her artistic life.Carol Easton, No Intermissions: The Life of Agnes de Mille, new ed. (New York: Da Capo, 2000), 233, 258. In one of her autobiographical volumes, de Mille herself said of Mitchell that he had \\"probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary.\\"Agnes de Mille, And Promenade Home (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1958), 195. Dance teacher and historian Shelley C. Berg comments that \\"Mitchell's ability to execute strenuous lifts has made his parts in de Mille ballets a particular challenge for dancers later performing his roles.\\" Berg, \\"Saving a Legacy: Agnes de Mille's 'Gold Rush,'\\" Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 19.1 (Summer 2001): 89 n. 56. When, nearly thirty years later, an interviewer asked Mitchell to respond to de Mille's comments, he offered a more modest assessment of his career: \\"I was primarily an actor [...] and I think what Agnes was referring to was my acting and regard for the woman I was partnering. Because in the end I really was a partner. When I look at today's dancers, or I look at the great dance films, such as Seven Brides for Seven Brothers--I couldn't do any of that! I know I was a dancer, but I didn't have the technique. At most I was an actor- dancer.\\"\\"Footnotes: Dancing for De Mille\\", Ballet News 7.9 (March 1986): 6.

His other significant credits include Broadway appearances in Carousel, First Impressions, and The Deputy; off-Broadway appearances in Winkelberg, The Threepenny Opera, Livin' the Life, and The Father; L'Histoire du Soldat at New York City Opera; and national tours of The Rainmaker (with future All My Children co-star Frances Heflin), The King and I, Funny Girl, and The Threepenny Opera. A character based on Mitchell appears in Anderson Ferrell's biographical dance play, Dance/Speak: The Life of Agnes De Mille, which debuted at New York Theatre Ballet in 2009. James Mitchell and Anne Bancroft in The Turning Point (1977) As a film performer, Mitchell had only moderate success. In the early 1940s, he did both chorus dancing and extra work in a number of minor musicals and westerns. On the strength of his award-winning performance in Brigadoon, he was scouted by producer Michael Curtiz and signed to a contract at Warner Brothers. Curtiz initially intended to put Mitchell in a picture with Doris Day that never materialized.Thomas F. Brady, \\"Stewart is Sought for Role by Curtiz\\", New York Times 20-9-1947: Amusements 12. After several months, Mitchell eventually made two films for Warner Brothers, including Raoul Walsh's Colorado Territory, before following Curtiz to Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. At MGM, he played supporting roles in six films between 1949‚Äì55, most notably Anthony Mann's Border Incident, Jacques Tourneur's Stars in My Crown, and Vincente Minnelli's critically lauded The Band Wagon (1953), in which he played the unsympathetic role of choreographer Paul Byrd ‚Äî an experience he loathed so much that he refused to see the film.Elsewhere, Mitchell blamed director Vincente Minnelli for creating an uncomfortable atmosphere on set; he felt that Minnelli \\"kind of trod on\\" Cyd Charisse, and admitted that \\"I don't remember him [Minnelli] very kindly.\\" Mark Griffin, A Hundred or More Hidden Things: The Life and Films of Vincente Minnelli (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2010), p. 162. He did not work for the studio again after appearing in the infamously over-budgeted flop The Prodigal (1955). Mitchell's film career ended abruptly after he starred in Hal R. Makelim's Western The Peacemaker (1956), the only time he was ever billed above the title, as he played the lead, gunfighter Terrall Butler. After that, it took over two decades before he made his next and what proved to be his final appearance on the big screen, The Turning Point (1977). He also co- starred with Thelma \\"Tad\\" Tadlock in the famous sponsored film A Touch of Magic presented by General Motors at the 1961 Motorama. Besides performing, Mitchell occasionally worked as a director and choreographer, particularly in the late 1960s and 1970s. He staged musicals at the Paper Mill Playhouse, the Mark Taper Forum, and The Muny, among other theatres. In 1956, he and Katherine Litz co-staged The Enchanted for American Ballet Theatre. Television career On television, Mitchell was considerably more active, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In addition to working regularly as a dancer, he played dramatic roles in a number of television films and prime-time series, as well as in the anthologies that were once so popular, such as Play of the Week, Gruen Guild Playhouse, and Armstrong Circle Theatre. In 1964, he took his first contract role on a soap opera in The Edge of Night, as the corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin. In 1966, he appeared in an episode of the espionage drama Blue Light. This was followed by a role in the entire run of the soap opera Where the Heart Is (1969‚Äì73), in which he played the male lead, Julian Hathaway. However, after Mack & Mabel flopped in 1974, Mitchell's performing career nearly ended altogether. He earned a BA from Empire State College and an MFA from Goddard College in order to teach full-time at the college level, and taught movement for actors at Juilliard, Yale University, and Drake University. After a few years of almost no work - although he was a guest star on Lou Grant and Charlie's Angels in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as \\"I cried and did a lot of gardening\\".Sheryl Khan, \\"The Gypsy in His Soul\\", Episodes May/June 1993: p. 62. He was hired in 1979 as self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt on ABC's long-running soap opera All My Children. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when she came back from the dead. After the introduction of David Canary in December 1983 as Adam Chandler, Palmer remained ruthless in business dealings, but toned down in romantic relationships. His old ways returned several times, such as when he was revealed to be hoarding stolen artwork and when he tried to kill his last wife, Vanessa, after falsely believing that she had cheated on him. His final appearance as a contract player was September 19, 2008, although his retirement was not made official until September 30, 2009. Personal life Mitchell's partner of thirty-nine years was the Oscar-award-winning costume designer Albert Wolsky. Death James Mitchell died on January 22, 2010, in Los Angeles. His death came after suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by pneumonia.

Upon its release, the film was both a critical and a commercial success. As well as being the highest- grossing musical film of 1948, Easter Parade was the second-highest grossing MGM musical of the 1940s after Meet Me in St. Louis. Plot In 1912, Broadway star Don Hewes (Fred Astaire) buys Easter presents for his sweetheart (\\"Happy Easter\\"), getting a boy to part with an Easter rabbit by distracting him with a set of drums (\\"Drum Crazy\\"). He takes the gifts to his dancing partner, Nadine Hale (Ann Miller), who has been offered a show with a solo opportunity. He persuades her to change her mind (\\"It Only Happens When I Dance With You\\") until his best friend, Johnny (Peter Lawford), arrives. Nadine reveals she and Don are no longer a team, clearly attracted to Johnny, who refuses her out of respect for Don. Don drowns his sorrow at a bar, bragging that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. Picking one of the onstage performers, Hannah Brown (Judy Garland), he tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. He tries to turn her into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her similar dresses, and giving her the \\"exotic\\" stage name \\"Juanita\\". She makes several mistakes at their first performance (\\"Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes\\"), and the show is a fiasco. Johnny is instantly attracted to Hannah, singing \\"A Fella With an Umbrella\\" while walking her to rehearsal. He tries unsuccessfully to reunite Don with Nadine, who tells Don her friends are laughing because Hannah is trying to be her. Realizing his mistake after hearing Hannah sing \\"I Love a Piano\\", Don prepares routines better suited to her. Now known as \\"Hannah & Hewes\\", they successfully perform \\"I Love a Piano,\\" \\"Snookie-Ookums\\", \\"The Ragtime Violin\\", and \\"When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam'\\". Auditioning for Ziegfeld Follies, Hannah and Don meet Nadine, the show's star. Hannah realizes Nadine was Don's former partner and demands to know if they were in love. At their hotel, Don reveals he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing Hannah and Nadine do not belong in the same show. Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner, revealing he has fallen in love with her, but Hannah admits she is actually in love with Don. Nadine's show opens (\\"Shakin' The Blues Away\\") with Don in the audience. He reveals to Hannah that he signed them to star in their own show, inviting her to celebrate over dinner. She arrives at his apartment only for him suggest a dance rehearsal. Declaring that he only sees her as a dancing aid, she tries to leave, but he kisses her. She plays the piano and sings \\"It Only Happens When I Dance With You,\\" and he realizes he is in love with her and they embrace. The show features a solo by Don (\\"Steppin' Out with My Baby\\"), followed by (\\"We're a Couple of Swells\\"), in which he and Hannah play bums. Afterward, they celebrate at the roof garden where Nadine is performing. The audience gives them a rousing ovation, much to Nadine's chagrin. After dancing in \\"The Girl on the Magazine Cover,\\" Nadine insists she and Don perform one of their old numbers ‚Äì \\"It Only Happens When I Dance With You (Reprise)\\". Don reluctantly agrees, upsetting Hannah who leaves, believing he has been using her to regain Nadine. At the bar where she and Don first met, Hannah pours out her troubles to Mike the bartender (\\"Better Luck Next Time\\"). She returns to her apartment to find Don waiting. He tries to explain himself, promising to wait all night for her to forgive him, but he is evicted by the house detective just before she opens the door. The next morning, Johnny reassures Hannah that if he loved someone, he would let her know, and Hannah goes to meet Don for their date at the Easter parade. Several gifts arrive at Don's apartment with no cards. Hannah arrives unexpectedly saying she sent them, oblivious to their argument and urging him to prepare for their date. Photographed as they walk in the Easter parade, echoing the film's opening with Nadine, Don proposes to Hannah (\\"Easter Parade\\"). Cast * Judy Garland as Hannah Brown. * Fred Astaire as Don Hewes. Gene Kelly was originally cast as Don, but he broke his ankle playing volleyball just prior to production. Astaire, who had announced his retirement from film, was coaxed back by Kelly to replace him. Astaire would 'retire' several more times over the next decade, but he would still go on to make a number of additional classic musicals in between retirements. * Peter Lawford as Jonathan Harrow III. * Ann Miller as Nadine Hale. This film marked her major MGM debut. She had previously been under contract to RKO in the 1930s and then to Columbia Pictures in the early to mid 40s, replacing Cyd Charisse, who withdrew from the production due to torn ligaments in her knee. * Jeni Le Gon as Essie, Nadine's maid. * Jules Munshin as Fran√ßois, the ma√Ætre d'. * Clinton Sundberg as Mike the bartender. * Jimmy Bates as the boy in the toy shop. * Norman Barker as the trombonist who plays in the duet with Judy Garland. * Jimmie Dodd (who went on to lead The Mickey Mouse Club) as the cab driver after Hannah leaves the Ziegfeld audition. Awards and honors The film won the 1948 Academy Award for Best Original Music Score. Its writers also received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical.

Audiences finally got to see it in the 90s when an edited version was included in the 1994 compilation film That's Entertainment! III. It was first seen as part of the extras on the VHS and Laser Disc special edition versions the following year. When the film was released to DVD, several minutes of outtakes, raw footage, and alternative takes of this performance were included in addition to the footage previously released. As with White Christmas six years later, it is impossible to remix the musical numbers from this film into Stereo or surround sound, because the original audio track recordings burned in a fire, leaving only a monaural composite track containing dialogue, music and effects, and an isolated music-only track intended for international release. Reception The film earned $4,144,000 in the US and Canada and $1,659,000 overseas, resulting in a hefty profit.

Roebling. He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War as an officer and was present at the Battle of Gettysburg. Education and military service The oldest son of John Roebling, Washington was born in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, a town co- founded by his father and his uncle, Carl Roebling. His early schooling consisted of tutoring by Riedel and under Henne in Pittsburgh. He was also sent to stay with Professor Lemuel Stephens of the Western University of Pennsylvania (now known as the University of Pittsburgh) where Roebling also attended some classes. He eventually attended the Trenton Academy and acquired further education at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, from 1854 to 1857, where he wrote a thesis titled \\"Design for a Suspension Aqueduct.\\"Caso, Frank. \\"Washington A. Roebling.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute Washington DC. Last modified November 8, 2012. Following his graduation as civil engineer (C.E.), he joined his father to work as a bridge builder. From 1858 to 1860, he assisted his father on the Allegheny Bridge project, living in a boarding house on Penn Street. Following the completion of the bridge, he returned to Trenton to work in his father's wire mill. On April 16, 1861, during the American Civil War, Roebling enlisted as a private in the New Jersey Militia. Seeking more than garrison duty, he resigned after two months and re-enlisted in a New York artillery battery, 2nd Lieut. Company K, 83rd NY Volunteers performing staff duty engaged in the erection of suspension bridges. He rose steadily in rank and was soon commissioned as an officer.McCullough 1972, pp. 157-162. Roebling saw action in numerous battles: Manassas Junction (Second Bull Run), Antietam, Chancellorsville, the Wilderness, Siege of Petersburg, and most notably Battle of Gettysburg. Soon after Chancellorsville, he was perhaps the first to note the movement of Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army toward the northwest while conducting air balloon reconnaissance. On July 2, 1863, during Gettysburg, Roebling was one of the initial officers on Little Round Top. Observing signs of Confederate troops approaching, he hurried down the hill to report to Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, for whom Roebling was aide-de-camp. General Warren and Roebling then descended the hill to find troops to secure this important tactical position. Roebling assisted in hoisting artillery up the hill, while Warren sent two of his aides, one of whom was Lt. Ranald S. Mackenzie, searching for infantry support. The two aides were able to secure a brigade from the Union V Corps. This brigade was commanded by Col. Strong Vincent whose brigade immediately occupied the hill and defended the left flank of the Army of the Potomac against repeated Confederate attacks. As Vincent's brigade began moving into position, Warren and Roebling had left the hill and Roebling was able to send the 140th New York Volunteers to the hill, not knowing that Vincent's brigade was already engaging advancing Confederate troops. However, the 140th New York provided much needed reinforcements.Norton 1992, pp. 292‚Äì296, 330‚Äì332. Roebling was brevetted lieutenant colonel in December 1864 for gallant service, ending his service brevetted to colonel. After the war, he became a veteran companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge From mid-1865 to 1867, Roebling worked with his father on the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge (now the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge). While traveling in Europe to research wire mills, bridges and caisson foundations, his only son, John A. Roebling II, was born. After returning to the U.S. in 1868, Washington became assistant engineer on the Brooklyn Bridge and was named chief engineer after his father's death in mid-1869. He made several important improvements on the bridge design and further developed bridge building techniques. Thus, he designed the two large pneumatic caissons that became the foundations for the two towers.McCullough 1992, p. 110ff In 1870, fire broke out in one of the caissons; from within the caisson, Roebling directed the efforts to extinguish the flames. Working in compressed air in these caissons under the river caused him to get decompression sickness (\\"the bends\\") shattering his health and rendering him unable to visit the site, yet he continued to oversee the Brooklyn project to successful completion in 1883. Besides the bends, he may have had additional afflictions, possible neurasthenia, side effects of treatments, and secondary drug addiction. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who had taught herself bridge construction, took over much of the chief engineer's duties including day-to-day supervision and project management. Although the couple jointly planned the bridge's continued construction, Emily successfully lobbied for formal retention of Washington as chief engineer. McCullough remarked that \\"nowhere in the history of great undertakings is there anything comparable\\" to Roebling conducting the largest and most difficult engineering project ever \\"in absentia.\\" Roebling would battle the after-effects from the caisson disease and its treatment the rest of his life. Th√©obald Chartran ‚Äì Portrait of Washington A. Roebling ‚Äì Brooklyn Museum Later years Following the Brooklyn project, Roebling and his wife lived in Troy, New York, from 1884 to 1888, as their only child, John A. Roebling II, also attended the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). When their son graduated, the Roeblings returned to Trenton, moving to 191 West State Street in 1892. From 1902 to 1903 Roebling served as President of the Alumni Association at Rensselaer. His wife Emily died in 1903 from stomach cancer. Roebling remarried in 1908 to Cornelia Witsell Farrow of Charleston, South Carolina. His namesake and nephew, Washington Augustus Roebling II, born March 25, 1881, only son of his brother Charles G. Roebling, went down with the RMS Titanic in 1912. Following the sudden death of another nephew, Karl Gustavus Roebling, in 1921, Roebling again became president of John A. Roebling's Sons Company at age 84. He died in 1926, after being bedridden for two months, at age 89. Roebling's most passionate hobby was collecting rocks and minerals. His collection of over 16,000 specimens was donated by his son, John A. Roebling II, to the Smithsonian Institution and became an important part of its mineral and gem collection. Many of his manuscripts, photographs, and publications, can be found in the Roebling collections at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. His family silver is on display in Ashford Castle, Cong, Co Mayo, Ireland. As of 2019, his only living descendants are New York musician Kriss Roebling and his two sons.

She spent her working life as one of the \\"Clyde sludge boats\\", making regular trips from Shieldhall in Glasgow, Scotland, down the River Clyde and Firth of Clyde past the Isle of Arran, to dump treated sewage sludge at sea. These steamships had a tradition, dating back to the First World War, of taking organised parties of passengers on their trips during the summer. SS Shieldhall has been preserved and the accommodation is again being put to good use for cruises. History Passengers can go down into the engine room between the two steam engines.The 1,972-ton Shieldhall was laid down in October 1954, built by Lobnitz & Co. of Renfrew who also constructed the two triple expansion steam engines which are set vertically in a similar way to the much larger engines on the RMS Titanic. By the 1950s Lobnitz usually built its engines with enclosed crankcases but the Shieldhall was deliberately fitted with traditional open-crank engines. Glasgow Corporation had long allowed day-trippers access to the engine room of its ships while at sea and the older-style engines allowed passengers to see the workings of the engines in operation. She was built on the classic lines of a 1920s steam tanker with a traditional wheelhouse of riveted and welded construction, a slightly raked stem and a cruiser stern. Her length is and breadth . Accommodation was provided for 80 passengers. She entered service in October 1955 and was operated by Glasgow Corporation to transport treated sewage sludge down the Clyde to be dumped at sea. She and her sister shps were jocularly known as Clyde banana boats as the livery resembled that of a well known banana shipping company. In 1976 after 21 years of service on the Clyde, Shieldhall was laid up, and in the following year was bought by the Southern Water Authority to carry sludge from Southampton, England, to an area south of the Isle of Wight. Preservation SS Shieldhall moored at Custom House quay, Greenock in 2005. Due to rising fuel prices she was withdrawn from service in 1985, then was taken over by a preservation society, The Solent Steam Packet Limited, which operates as a charity. All work associated with the Society and Shieldhall is carried out by unpaid volunteers. The remaining Glasgow sludge boats kept going into the 1990s, when changing environmental standards led to new ways of treating the sludge.Shieldhall Sewage Works, The Glasgow Story With work carried out mainly by volunteers she has been restored to sea-going condition, and now listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, the Shieldhall is now a frequent sight around the Solent running excursions, crewed by volunteers. She has been to the Netherlands for the Dordrecht Steam Festival and has been at International Festivals of the Sea at Bristol and Portsmouth. Passengers are encouraged to visit the bridge and see the engine room, getting an understanding of the days of steam. SS Shieldhall sets out from Greenock on a cruise in 2005. (alternative image). In July 2005 the Shieldhall made a return visit to the Clyde, taking part in the River Festival in Glasgow, and berthing at Custom House Quay, Greenock. She made a number of excursions, taking passengers on cruises from Greenock on her old route down the Clyde to Arran. In 2012, to mark the centenary of the sinking of RMS Titanic, the Shieldhall was repainted in the same colour scheme as the liner. A ¬£1.4 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) , announced in April 2013, is for essential hull works to meet modern regulations, improved passenger facilities and interpretation.

History A survey paper from 1975 of the subject by Anatoly Vershik, Israel Gelfand and M. I. Graev attributes the original interest in the topic to research in theoretical physics of the local current algebra, in the preceding years. Research on the finite configuration representations was in papers of R. S. Ismagilov (1971), and A. A. Kirillov (1974). The representations of interest in physics are described as a cross product C‚àû(M)¬∑Diff(M). Constructions Let therefore M be a n-dimensional connected differentiable manifold, and x be any point on it. Let Diff(M) be the orientation-preserving diffeomorphism group of M (only the identity component of mappings homotopic to the identity diffeomorphism if you wish) and Diffx1(M) the stabilizer of x. Then, M is identified as a homogeneous space :Diff(M)/Diffx1(M). From the algebraic point of view instead, C^\\\\infty(M) is the algebra of smooth functions over M and I_x(M) is the ideal of smooth functions vanishing at x. Let I_x^n(M) be the ideal of smooth functions which vanish up to the n-1th partial derivative at x. I_x^n(M) is invariant under the group Diffx1(M) of diffeomorphisms fixing x. For n > 0 the group Diffxn(M) is defined as the subgroup of Diffx1(M) which acts as the identity on I_x(M)/I_x^n(M). So, we have a descending chain :Diff(M) ‚äÉ Diffx1(M) ‚äÉ ... ‚äÉ Diffxn(M) ‚äÉ ... Here Diffxn(M) is a normal subgroup of Diffx1(M), which means we can look at the quotient group :Diffx1(M)/Diffxn(M). Using harmonic analysis, a real- or complex-valued function (with some sufficiently nice topological properties) on the diffeomorphism group can be decomposed into Diffx1(M) representation-valued functions over M. The supply of representations So what are the representations of Diffx1(M)? Let's use the fact that if we have a group homomorphism œÜ:G ‚Üí H, then if we have a H-representation, we can obtain a restricted G-representation. So, if we have a rep of :Diffx1(M)/Diffxn(M), we can obtain a rep of Diffx1(M). Let's look at :Diffx1(M)/Diffx2(M) first. This is isomorphic to the general linear group GL+(n, R) (and because we're only considering orientation preserving diffeomorphisms and so the determinant is positive). What are the reps of GL+(n, R)? :GL^+(n,\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\cong \\\\mathbb{R}^+\\\\times SL(n,\\\\mathbb{R}). We know the reps of SL(n, R) are simply tensors over n dimensions. How about the R+ part? That corresponds to the density, or in other words, how the tensor rescales under the determinant of the Jacobian of the diffeomorphism at x. (Think of it as the conformal weight if you will, except that there is no conformal structure here). (Incidentally, there is nothing preventing us from having a complex density). So, we have just discovered the tensor reps (with density) of the diffeomorphism group. Let's look at :Diffx1(M)/Diffxn(M). This is a finite-dimensional group. We have the chain :Diffx1(M)/Diffx1(M) ‚äÇ ... ‚äÇ Diffx1(M)/Diffxn(M) ‚äÇ ... Here, the \\"‚äÇ\\" signs should really be read to mean an injective homomorphism, but since it is canonical, we can pretend these quotient groups are embedded one within the other. Any rep of :Diffx1(M)/Diffxm(M) can automatically be turned into a rep of :Diffx1/Diffxn(M) if n > m. Let's say we have a rep of :Diffx1/Diffxp + 2 which doesn't arise from a rep of :Diffx1/Diffxp + 1. Then, we call the fiber bundle with that rep as the fiber (i.e. Diffx1/Diffxp + 2 is the structure group) a jet bundle of order p. Side remark: This is really the method of induced representations with the smaller group being Diffx1(M) and the larger group being Diff(M). Intertwining structure In general, the space of sections of the tensor and jet bundles would be an irreducible representation and we often look at a subrepresentation of them. We can study the structure of these reps through the study of the intertwiners between them. If the fiber is not an irreducible representation of Diffx1(M), then we can have a nonzero intertwiner mapping each fiber pointwise into a smaller quotient representation. Also, the exterior derivative is an intertwiner from the space of differential forms to another of higher order. (Other derivatives are not, because connections aren't invariant under diffeomorphisms, though they are covariant.) The partial derivative isn't diffeomorphism invariant. There is a derivative intertwiner taking sections of a jet bundle of order p into sections of a jet bundle of order p + 1\\\\.
