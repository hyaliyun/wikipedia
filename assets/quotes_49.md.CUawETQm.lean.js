Ripple was built as a civilian steel-hulled fishing trawler by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company at Quincy, Massachusetts, for the Bay State Fishing Company of Boston, Massachusetts, and was launched on 20 November 1910. In 1917, the Russian Empire purchased Ripple and the trawlers Foam and Spray from Bay State Fishing, intending to place them in Imperial Russian Navy service during World War I. The Russians gave Ripple a new name, T44, but the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917 prevented the three ships from leaving the United States. On 29 May 1918, the U.S. Navy chartered all three ships from the Russian Government for World War I use. T44 was assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 2491, placed under the control of the Commandant, 3rd Naval District, and, reverting to her commercial name, was commissioned at Tebo's Yacht Basin in New York City on 6 August 1918 as USS Ripple (ID-2491) with Chief Boatswains Mate Lewis E. Dodd in command. Outfitted as a minesweeper, Ripple was assigned to the 3rd Naval District and based at Base No. 8 at Tompkinsville on Staten Island, New York. She operated on patrol and minesweeping duties off the Ambrose Light Vessel and Fire Island Light Vessel into 1919. On 1 January 1919, Ripple joined the tug USS Resolute (SP-1309) and the submarine chasers USS SC-55 and USS SC-293 in assisting the troop transport USS Northern Pacific, which had run aground off Fire Island, New York, that day. Northern Pacific was refloated on 18 January 1919, and salvage operations were completed on 21 January 1919. Ripple was decommissioned on 11 February 1919 at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, and returned to representatives of the by-then-exiled Imperial Russian government. That government having been deposed in 1917, she was sold locally, and operated as a commercial fishing trawler out of Boston until being scrapped in 1949.

Ready Georgia is supported by The Ad Council, local volunteer organizations, and corporate partnerships. Mission Governor Sonny Perdue, GEMA/OHS director Charley English, Ready Kids mascot Rex the mountain lion, and Georgia elementary school students pose during Ready Georgia's official launch at the state capital building. GEMA created the Ready Georgia campaign in response to survey data revealing that nearly 80 percent of Georgia residents had not taken even the most basic steps towards being prepared for the wide range of natural and man-made disasters that threaten the state. Ready Georgia intends to \\"promote a preparedness and prevention culture\\" in Georgia through public education and outreach. The campaign specifically encourages residents to be prepared so they can safely oversee their own evacuation and maintain self- sufficiency for a full three days after an emergency. Education and outreach One of Ready Georgia's primary concerns is ensuring that individuals and households have an adequately stocked ready kit, which is essential in maintaining awareness and self-sufficiency in the wake of a disaster. Through a partnership with the Home Depot corporation, Ready Georgia has been able to put on statewide workshops that teach children about disaster preparedness. Utilizing its Web site, Ready Georgia has also been able to provide a tool that can assist users in calculating exactly how much food and water they will need for their own kits. Notable Georgians such as Atlanta Falcons fullback Ovie Mughelli, NASCAR Sprint Cup driver David Ragan, and former Atlanta Braves outfielder Jeff Francoeur participated by creating profiles on Ready Georgia's Web site letting Georgians know what is in their ready kits. Georgia's 5th graders were able to enter a Ready Georgia art and essay contest, for which they were asked to submit work demonstrating how they are their families would prepare for a variety of disasters. The winners received their own ready kits from Home Depot, as well as personal and school recognition on Ready Georgia's Web site. In 2009, Ready Georgia was able to provide Georgia residents with 200 NOAA weather radio receivers at no cost and many more at a reduced price, in an effort to acknowledge and address the fact that economically disadvantaged citizens face greater challenges in the face of a disaster and are often unprepared. Ready Georgia has additionally sought to address the economic impact of disasters through the development of materials stressing the importance of proper business continuity planning to Georgia-based businesses. This is especially critical in the Atlanta metro area, which is home to the fourth most Fortune 500 company headquarters among all cities in America. Emergencies addressed since inception In September 2009, Georgia experienced significant flooding, resulting in a state of emergency being declared for 17 counties. Awareness and preparation are critical elements of an effective response to flooding, which often necessitates evacuation and cuts off access to supplies of food and clean water. The importance of flood insurance in mitigating the social and economic damage caused by flooding is another awareness and preparedness issue for anyone facing the prospect of flooding; Ready Georgia has sought to address all of these issues. H1N1 influenza, known commonly as \\"swine flu\\", has been a health issue of public concern since early 2009, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The Georgia Department of Community Health Division of Public Health and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency have used the Ready Georgia campaign to disseminate preparedness information to Georgians.

A Roman Catholic religious sister, she was a member of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the- Woods, Indiana. One of her most cited works is her essay \\"Modern Old Testament Criticism\\" in The New Jerome Biblical Commentary. In addition to her writing, she taught for twenty years at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. Early life She was born on June 19, 1918, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She entered religious life on February 14, 1938. Two of her natural sisters had already become sisters as well (Sister Mary Josephine and Sister David). Suelzer became a fully professed Sister on August 15, 1946. Career Suelzer earned a bachelor's degree in English at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College and then taught high school for fourteen years. By utilizing summer sessions, she completed a master's degree in English at Marquette University in 1956. That year she was selected to study at the Regina Mundi institute in Rome. In 1958, Suelzer was sent to study for a doctorate in Sacred Doctrine at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. This was at \\"a time during which ... few women were encouraged to pursue study in the specialized field of scripture.\\" New approaches to scriptural religious studies were being developed in those years that were seen by many bishops as controversial. Suelzer's advisor Father Gerald Sloyan suggested she avoid unwanted criticism by giving her visionary dissertation a more traditional, pedagogical title, \\"The Utilization of the Pentateuch in the Teaching of College Scripture.\\" Suelzer completed her PhD in 1962; two years later her dissertation was published by Herder and Herder as The Pentateuch: A Study in Salvation History. Suelzer's theological understanding became even more important to the Sisters of Providence after the church changes of the Second Vatican Council. She was active in the theological formation of new sisters. In 1964 she presented at the annual conference for the Conference of Major Superiors of Women (CMSW). In later years, in addition to teaching theology at Saint Mary- of-the-Woods College for many years, Suelzer led retreats and spoken on the subject of prayer and scriptures. She was part of a committee to look into the case of Michigan Sister of Mercy Agnes Mary Mansour, who controversially refused to resign her position as the state's Director of Social Services though the State provided abortion services. Suelzer also participated in the Brookland Commission, an inquiry beginning in 1988 into the place of intellectual life among communities of women religious. Suelzer continued to write and teach in her later years, teaching in the Masters of Pastoral Theology program at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College well into her eighties and contributing to Sisters of Providence publications regularly into her nineties.

One of the earliest examples of industrial architecture in Tennessee, the mill operated variously from its construction around 1830 until the 1950s. The mill was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in the 1970s. Efforts to restore the mill began in 1980, but before the restoration could be completed, the mill was destroyed by arson in 1991. The Lenoir Cotton Mill was one of several enterprises established by early settler and entrepreneur William Ballard Lenoir (1775-1852). Lenoir moved to the area in 1810 after his father, General William Lenoir, deeded to him the tract of land comprising what is now Lenoir City. The younger Lenoir established the Lenoir Manufacturing Company in 1817, which engaged in multiple agricultural and industrial enterprises throughout the 19th century. The cotton mill was completed in the early 1830s and gradually expanded in subsequent decades. During the U.S. Civil War, Union soldiers destroyed parts of the estate of the Confederate-leaning Lenoir family, but spared the mill due to William Ballard Lenoir's son Benjamin's Mason affiliations. After the Lenoir family sold the mill in the 1890s, it operated variously as a hosiery mill and later as a flour mill.Joe Spence, Lenoir Cotton Mill . Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 2009-11-05. Location The Lenoir Cotton Mill site is located near the corner of Depot Street and South Hill Street, just off U.S. Route 11 in downtown Lenoir City. Town Creek, which flows along the eastern base of the mill site, empties into the Tennessee River about a half- mile to the south. The William Ballard Lenoir house, built in 1821, still stands across the street from the mill site, although it has been drastically modified as a residential apartment complex. Another structure related to the mill, the Lenoir Cotton Mill Warehouse, stands about a half-mile to the southeast, and has recently been restored and currently serves as a residence. History The Lenoir Cotton Mill, rising above Town Creek What is now Lenoir City was originally part of a grant of land given to General William Lenoir (1751-1839) for service in the American Revolution. Lenoir deeded the land to his son, William Ballard Lenoir, who moved his family to the area in 1810. William Ballard Lenoir established the Lenoir Manufacturing Company in 1817, and engaged in numerous agricultural and industrial endeavors. Along with the cotton mill, Lenoir built a sawmill and gristmill on Town Creek, and raised livestock. The Lenoir family used both slave labor and paid labor in their enterprises. The ruins of the Lenoir Cotton Mill, now part of a city park The cotton mill was completed in the early 1830s. A Pittsburgh miller named E.F. Faber built a 113-spindle spinning jack and three looms for Lenoir's mill in 1831. Lenoir's farm grew and ginned its own cotton throughout the 1830s, but eventually Lenoir employed his sons to purchase raw cotton for the mill. By the mid-1850s, the mill had 620 spindles, and was powered by an overshot waterwheel. In 1855, the mill's value was listed at $12,000, making it the Lenoirs' most valuable asset. After Lenoir's death in 1852, his sons continued operating the mill. During the Civil War (1861-1865), the Lenoirs supported the Confederacy, and when Union soldiers occupied the Lenoir estate in 1863, they burned the Lenoirs' railroad depot, general store, and several other outbuildings. As they prepared to burn the cotton mill, William Ballard Lenoir's son, Benjamin Ballard Lenoir, walked through the ranks of the Union troops flashing a secret Masonic sign, and the troops spared the mill. By 1890, when the Lenoir City Company purchased the Lenoir estate, the mill had been expanded to include over 1,000 spindles. The Holston Manufacturing Company used the mill for a hosiery operation in the 1890s, although the mill was eventually converted into a flour mill, which operated until the 1950s. In 1980, the Lenoir Cotton Mill Association was formed to preserve the mill, and eventually raised over $100,000 for its restoration. The mill was destroyed by arson in 1991, however, and in 1996 Lenoir City rejected a plan to rebuild the mill, choosing instead to include the mill's ruins in plans for a city park. One of the mill's warehouses, known as the Lenoir Cotton Mill Warehouse, was restored and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

Richard Woodman (1524?‚Äì1557) was a Protestant martyr, who was born in Buxted and lived in nearby Warbleton in East Sussex. He was burnt during the Marian Persecutions in 1557 in Lewes. The cult of the Sussex Martyrs is said to have been started using an etching by James Henry Hurdis of Woodman burning as a Protestant martyr.Christopher Whittick, ‚ÄòHurdis, James Henry (1800‚Äì1857)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 6 Nov 2009 Life Woodman was born around 1524 in Buxted in East Sussex; he became an ironmaster, and became known whilst running an \\"iron-making\\" business that employed one hundred people. During a sermon at St Mary the Virgin Church, Warbleton, Woodman was arrested for having words with the rector which are said to have identified Woodman as a Protestant. Woodman said that the rector was preaching the exact opposite of what he previously said (before Mary was Queen). Woodman lived close to the church and his foundry was also adjacent. Woodman was in contravention of a 1553 law which protected preachers from criticism whilst preaching. Woodman was imprisoned and investigated at intervals by local magistrates and at quarter sessions where he refused to assure them of his intention to conform. He served terms in prison amounting to six months in total where he was examined by the Bishop of Chichester, George Day, and by the commissioners of Cardinal Pole. The memorial at St Mary the Virgin Church, Warbleton Finally he was sent to the Queen's Bench in London although it is not certain if this was legal. There he stayed for another year and a half until Dr. John Story, the persecuting chancellor, sent him to the bishop's \\"coalhouse\\". Whilst a prisoner there he was further examined including an investigation by thirty respectable people who set him free on 18 December 1555. His release was unconditional as they could find no heresy and his arrest appeared to be illegal. It was said that Woodman had submitted to the church but he unwisely corrected this view by undertaking preaching around his parish to correct any misunderstandings over his position. Woodman fled abroad after a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He returned again, but was turned in by his brother (allegedly because they had a financial dispute). Woodman was again in the bishop's \\"coalhouse\\" where he was again examined before being sent to the Marshalsea prison. John Christopherson who was to be the next Bishop of Chichester conducted a second examination on 27 April 1557, but Woodman could not be tried as Christopherson had not been appointed. John White, the Bishop of Winchester then examined Woodman in St George's Church in Southwark, but he had no jurisdiction over Woodman. Over the next few weeks, Woodman was examined again by White, Christopherson and William Roper and in combination they managed to get Woodman to admit a heresy and he was excommunicated. Woodman was taken to Lewes and burnt in front of the Star Inn (now the Town Hall), together with nine others on 22 June 1557. The nine were George Stevens, Alexander Hosman, William Mainard, Thomasina Wood, Margery Morris, James Morris, Denis Burges, Ann Ashdon and Mary Groves. This was the largest number of people burnt in England at one time and was intended to serve as a warning to others. Legacy Today Richard Woodman's martyrdom is remembered with the memorial pictured in his local churchyard, and he with others are celebrated in the Bonfire Night celebrations which are peculiar to Sussex.England's Christian Heritage, accessed November 2009 M. A. Lower published the Sussex Martyrs in the mid-nineteenth century, a book credited with reviving memories of the martyrs. At the time the martyr deaths had been largely forgotten, and Lower believed that High Churchmen were referring to the Protestant Reformation and the deaths of these people as \\"a mistake\\". Following the publications \\"anti-popish\\" demonstrations took place each year around 5 November. In 1868 a figure dressed as the \\"Bishop of Lewes\\" warned Protestants of the Roman Catholic threat and the following year an effigy of the pope was to be blown up with gunpowder.

It is initially a free application available on the iTunes App Store but users are encouraged to and often buy upgrades. On October 29, 2013 it was announced that Race or Die will no longer be available for play. \\"The time has come for us to say goodbye to Race or Die. For years, Machine Zone games have attracted a very special group of players and we certainly appreciate your participation in the community. The lifetime of this game has drawn to an end, and now we will be focusing on new ideas and other innovative concepts in the game arena. We would like to thank everyone who has taken part in this online community.\\" Features Race or Die (ROD) features push notifications for 3.0 without extra text messaging charges. Users are notified when raced, are able to invite friends to race and can receive messages friends during the gameplay. ROD also features updates with new missions, cars, car parts, and gifts from the sponsor. ROD allows users to customize their ride, race other players online with all statistics of wins and losses kept in the user's profile. Gameplay In order to play ROD the player must have an iPhone or iPod Touch with a working internet connection and access to the iTunes Store. After downloading the game from the Store and opening the game, the \\"home\\" screen appears. The player is immediately awarded \\"respect points\\", usually in increments of 10 units. The points can be used to create cash in the game or enhance the users's health, fuel, nitrous or friends on the user's crew. The choices for allocation of these points are found in the \\"sponsor\\" screen. Once obtained money can then be used to either purchase items from the pro shop, deposited in the atm, or to purchase any number of estates. Pro shop Once the pro shop icon is touched, the game opens to a screen the gives the player three options on how to spend cash: \\"cars\\", \\"performance parts\\" or \\"illegal mods\\". The cars, parts and mods available for purchase become more powerful and expensive as the game progresses. Each of the items is important because the accumulation of each item helps in the \\"race\\" section of the game. Race Once the race icon is touched, the game opens to a page with a list of 10 other users on an equal experience level. Tapping on the race button next to the users name starts the race. A statistical race is then run and based on the number of cars, parts, mods and crew each user has, a winner is determined. In many cases the winner acquires cash from the loser as well as being awarded experience points. After the \\"race\\" is over, the user is returned to the \\"list of racers\\" and is able to race again. When a race results in the loser's vehicle being \\"towed\\" or \\"totaled\\", that user is no longer seen on the list of racers having been replaced by another randomly selected racer/user, presumably from anywhere in the world. Regardless of the outcome of the race, each race drains the user of nitrous and health; more health is lost when the user/racer loses. Once below unit 26 in health, the user/racer is sent to the garage for repairs. The player can pay cash for the repairs or restoration of health, or just simple wait a few minutes. One unit of health returns every 3 minutes. The user can also go to the sponsor and spend respect points for a full health refill(1 respect point) or a full nitrous refill(5 points). Crew One of the most critical components of game play in ROD is the number of users in one's crew. During each race, members of the player's crew are allowed to race with up to 10 times the level the player is on. If the user is one level 2, up to 20 crew may accompany the user during the statical race, level 3, up to 30 and so on. Thus one user with same number of cars, parts and mods as another user, but with more crew will prevail in the statistical race, taking cash and experience. Crew members are acquired by asking other users to join your crew. The game offers a \\"location invite\\" tool which employs gps and triangulation to find users geographically close by and invites them; or the user can \\"post\\" the user's 9 digit friend code and ask other users to punch the code into their \\"invite friend by code\\" section. This will notify the user of the invitation, once the user responds, the number of crew members increases at near the top of the home screen. Estates Owning Real Estate is the only way to generate recurring Cash Flow Income in Race or Die. Generally, the income from one's properties will significantly exceed that earned from racing or missions. Given the high upkeep of the better cars and the relatively low income from the available properties, it is especially critical that one maximizes their real estate income. The Income provided by real estate is earned every 50 or 60 minutes depending on one's character type. This occurs whether or not the player is actively playing. Upkeep costs are automatically deducted at the same time. The key to maximizing one's income from Real Estate is understanding the concept of Return on Investment (ROI). If one views real estate as an investment of their cash, then the ROI on that investment is equal to the income provided by that property divided by its current cost. This number is commonly expressed as a percentage and indicates the rate of return for that particular property. When choosing which property to buy, one should always choose the one that provides the highest available ROI in order to maximize their investment and income. The cost of each real estate property increases by 10% with each purchase, decreasing its ROI. This provides incentive to advance in level in order to unlock additional real estate types that provide a higher ROI. Online Race or Die Calculators can help one determine which estates they should buy given their bankroll and level. Codes In one tab of the game it was possible to enter special codes that would grant the player specific items. One example of these codes was \\"slipperywhenwet\\" which would grant the player with special tires.

Located in the historic center of Mexico City in an old fire house, the museum has a collection which includes textiles, pottery, glass, pi√±atas, alebrijes, furniture and much more. However, the museum is best known as the sponsor of the yearly, Noche de Alebrijes (Night of the Alebrijes) parade in which the fantastical creatures are constructed on a monumental scale and then paraded from the main plaza or Zocalo to the Angel of Independence monument, competing for prizes. The museum The building of the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Tree of life whose theme is crafts. Sculpture display at the Museum de Artes Populares in Mexico City by Oscar Soteno. The Museo de Arte Popular opened in March 2006. Its purpose is to serve as a reference for Mexican crafts as well as promoting them through workshops, and other events to both Mexico and foreign tourism. and dignify Mexican crafts though restoration of older works and the promotion of their creation both inside and outside the museum itself. The permanent collection contains both older and newer craft pieces from the various traditions that make up Mexican culture. The collection was gathered through the generosity of individual donors. Some of the principal private donors include Alfonso Romo of Grupo Savia, who had promoted crafts for a number of years. He donated 1,400 pieces towards the opening of the museum. The second donor was Carlota Mapeli, who came to Mexico from Italy in the 1970s and dedicated herself to collecting embroidered garments and other textiles. She donated 400 pieces, many of which were weaved on backstrap looms. The collection is organized into five permanent halls divided by theme, and two dedicated to ‚Äúgrand masters‚Äù each of which contains various kinds of crafts. The five themed halls are called ‚ÄúLas raices del arte mexicano‚Äù (Roots of Mexican art), ‚ÄúLas raices del arte popular‚Äù (Roots of crafts or popular art), ‚ÄúLo cotidiano‚Äù (Everyday things), ‚ÄúLo religioso‚Äù (Religious items) and ‚ÄúLo fantasmagico‚Äù (Fantastic and magical things). The collection fills three of the four levels of the building, for a total of 7,000 square meters. There is also a temporary exhibit hall and an ‚Äúinterpretation‚Äù room which has pieces from all 32 federal entities (states and Distrito Federal) of Mexico. Crafts displayed here are of many different types including pottery, basketry, wood carving, precious metal working, glasswork, textiles, papier-m√¢ch√© and others. The museum also has a research center with a library and a periodical archive. Collection of folk string instruments Hidalgo in 2011. Contemporary pottery by Nicolas Vita Hernandez of Chililco, Huejutla at a temporary exhibit on Hidalgo crafts at the Museo de Arte Popular. Every weekend the museum has workshops for children between six and twelve in various crafts with the aim of preserving these crafts. Workshops include those on paper cutting, amate (bark) paper and papier-m√¢ch√©. For special occasions such as Dia de Muertos, workshops have included those on making Catrina figures, sugar skulls and traditional candies. Part of the courtyard of the Museum of Artes Populares in Mexico City The gift shop contains a wide variety of crafts for sale from the most traditional to the most recent reinterpretations of various crafts, containing items such as furniture, textiles and toys from all parts of the republic of Mexico. The museum‚Äôs store is non-profit, designed to help artisans get better prices for their products. Many of the products come from villages in Michoac√°n, often populated only by women and children as the men go to places like the United States to work. Sales of their products have been good enough to entice a number of men to return home and work at the crafts. The building is considered to be the second most important Art Deco building in Mexico City, with the first being the main offices of the Secretariat of Health in Chapultepec. It was donated to the museum project by the government of Mexico City. The building was constructed in 1927 by architect Vicente Mendiola as part of the government‚Äôs efforts to modernize the city‚Äôs infrastructure at the time. The building has a central patio in which the fire trucks were parked, and three floors for offices and quarters. In its exterior, it has tower on the corner facing the intersection with a light at the top to be used to signal an emergency. Another feature of the building is the relieves with pre- Hispanic motifs that decorate the facade in stone. The inner courtyard is covered by a modern glass cupola. By the 1980s the growth of the city had rendered the station inadequate and it was abandoned. It deteriorated afterwards because of the 1985 earthquake and the general deterioration of the historic center. In the 1990s, the city government decided to rescue the building and use it to collect and store a major collection of Mexican crafts. This project was given to Teodoro Gonzalez de Leon, who restored the building updating its interior. The Monumental Alebrije Parade Alebrije named El Aguas Vivas at the Juarez Street portion of the parade. Lighted alebrije figures on display at the museum The museum is best known for its yearly parade of ‚Äúmonumental alebrijes‚Äù which began as a yearly event in 2007. An alebrije is a fantastical creature, which usually include various parts of real-life or fantastic creatures. These not only include creatures such as flies with dragon tails and multi-headed lions, the works also carry fantastic names such as ‚ÄúLa Mula de Seis‚Äù (The Six Mule), ‚ÄúAlebrijos‚Äù (combination of alebrije and ‚Äúhijos‚Äù (sons)), ‚ÄúAH1N1‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa G√°rgola de la Atl√°ntida‚Äù (The Gargoyle of Atlantis). Normal alebrijes are small sculptures made of cardboard or wood, painted in bright colors and mostly made in central Mexico and Oaxaca state. Monumental alebrejes are floats with the tallest one so far being four meters tall by three meters wide. Animation clip (in Spanish) about alebrijes made by the museum in collaboration with Wiki Learning, Tec de Monterrey The event is called La Noche de los Alebrijes (Night of the Alebrijes) and organized by the Museo de Arte Popular in collaboration with the Mexico City government with the support of CONACULTA and various private institutions and individuals. The purpose of the parade is to promote the work of modern Mexican artists and artisans. The process of creating the alebrijes begins in June, with the parade taking place at the end of October. Most of the monumental alebrijes are created with cardboard except for those from Oaxaca which are partially made of wood, and wind their way from the main plaza (Z√≥calo), through the historic center onto the Paseo de la Reforma ending at the Angel of Independence. The alebrijes compete for first, second and third prizes of 50,000, 30,000 and 20,000 pesos. After the parade, later in the day, the winners are chosen and other events such as the Alebrije Puppet Contest and the Alebrije Short Story Contest take place. The 2007 parade had thirty five alebrijes with 200,000 spectators filling the streets of the city center. In 2008, there were seventy five alebrijes with more than two million spectators. The 2009 parade had 120 floats registered with it, coming from Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca and Morelos. Marching bands such as the Navy band and the state bands of the states of Mexico and Morelos and Private bands such as El Reflejo Sinaloense, La Usurpadora, Cerro Verde and La Coqueta also participated. All of the alebrijes were newly created for the event and were designed by more than 100 artists. After the parade, the alebrijes are placed on display for about two weeks on Paseo de la Reforma between the Angel of Independence and the Diana Fountain. The director of the museum stated that each year both the number and the quality of the alebrijes have improved.

Marcella bore Appianus a daughter named Claudia Pulchra and a son, named Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus.Lightman, A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women, p.205; Gaius Stern, Women, Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae, Berk. diss. 2006, chapter 6. There has been some speculation among historians such as George Patrick Goold that her daughter Claudia Pulchra might have actually been the child of Publius Claudius Pulcher (the son of Clodius) but others such as Ronald Syme have rejected this proposal. Syme does on the other hand agree that Appianus likely wasn't Marcella's first husband, as the marriage is recorded rather late, he instead proposed a marriage to a son of Lucius Marcius Philippus who may have died or been repudiated before he was old enough to be consul. Marcella later married the former consul and censor Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus, also known as Paullus Aemilius Lepidus.article of Octavia Minor at Livius.org Paullus was previously widowed. From the earlier marriage he had three children.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy, pp. 150-1 The marriage of Marcella and Paullus linked two honored republican houses and tied them closely to the imperial circle. Marcella bore him a son called Paullus Aemilius Regulus. Regulus served as a quaestor during the rule of the Roman emperor Tiberius who reigned from 14 until 37.ILS 949 Some scholars have tried to reverse the order of her husbands, but find difficulty if they delay Marcella's first marriage (as alleged) until 15 BC when she was 25. If so, she would be very old for a first marriage, and then have to remarry and immediately have two children before her second husband died in office in 12 BC. Instead, marriage 10 years earlier seems much more likely, given that Marcella's two younger half-sisters had already married by 15, and the younger Antonia gave birth to Germanicus on 24 May 15 BC. According to the French Historian Christian Settipani, after the death of her second husband, Marcella married the Roman Senator Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus.Settipani, Continuit√© gentilice et continuit√© s√©natoriale dans les familles s√©natoriales romaines √† l'√©poque imp√©riale Marcella bore Messallinus a daughter called Valeria Messallia born ca. 10 BC, who later married the praetor of 17, Lucius Vipstanus Gallus. However, Messallinus (son of Corvinus) was younger than Marcella. That fact does not prevent the marriage, but makes it unlikely, given Roman tradition. Legacy In a tomb near Rome, numerous inscriptions have survived of slaves and freedmen of Marcella.CIL VI 4418-4880 A columbarium located between the Via Appia and Via Latina in Rome belonged to the family of Marcella. According to epigraphical evidence, the work on it was completed in 10, when the urns were divided among the shareholders of the company which had built the place.

It was part of the Heroes of Might and Magic franchise. Originally scheduled for release in late 2005, the final release was delayed for three years, and the game launched in May 2008. The game was free of charge. Heroes of Might and Magic Online finally went offline on 31 March 2014.  Story  The background story was set in the same world as Heroes III (most notably the kingdom of Erathia) although Ubisoft‚Äîthe Might and Magic brand rights licensor‚Äîintroduced a new universe for the whole Might and Magic series after having acquired the rights from The 3DO Company. The game did not appear to have an actual story, however, and any events that took place in it would not be considered canon.  Features  Heroes of Might and Magic Online featured four magic systems and allowed the player to choose heroes from eight factions comprising a total of 56 unit types. It was staged on three different levels: * A global, randomly generated level, where players moved and interacted in a typical MMORPG fashion (in realtime) * A strategic level, similar to a Heroes III map, where the heroes moved within a certain amount of time * A turn-based 3D combat level using a tactical grid, similar to the combat mode in Heroes III  English version  A closed beta test for the English version was held from May 7 to June 9, 2010. Two days later, on June 11, the game went live. The English version only allowed users with Asian IP addresses to play, since TQ's license from Ubisoft was for Asia only.

Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein (1425‚Äì1492) was the youngest son of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves, and of his wife Marie of Burgundy, a sister of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.  Marriage and issue  Philip the Good of Burgundy and his wife, Isabel of Portugal, decided to arrange the marriage of their nephew Adolph, who became engaged to infanta Beatrice of Coimbra, daughter of Pedro, Duke of Coimbra. Beatrice had taken refuge in Burgundy, under her aunt‚Äôs protection, following the defeat of her father's army in the Battle of Alfarrobeira in Portugal in 1449. Adolph and Beatrice were married on 13 May 1453 and they subsequently had two children: *Philip of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein; and *Louise of Cleves (who died at a young age). Following Beatrice's death, Adolph married his cousin Anne of Burgundy, a natural daughter of duke Philip the Good and governess of Mary of Burgundy, Duchess of Burgundy. In 1463, Adolph inherited Wijnendale Castle, where in 1482 Mary of Burgundy would fall from her horse suffering fatal injuries. This accident would have major implications for the history of the Low Countries.  Career  Adolph participated in all the battles that involved the Dukes of Burgundy. He was knighted after the Battle of Gavere, which ended the Revolt of Ghent (1449‚Äì1453). In 1454, he participated in the Feast of the Pheasant and became a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1456. In 1467, he played an important role in the Battle of Brustem during the Li√®ge Wars. In 1475, he was stadtholder-general of the Low Countries during the absence of Charles the Bold who was fighting the Burgundian Wars, a position confirmed by Mary of Burgundy after Charles' death in the Battle of Nancy in 1477.

Description An original part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston designed by landscape architect Charles Eliot in the 1890s, Hemlock Gorge Reservation protects the banks of the Charles River where it passes through the corners of Needham and Newton Upper Falls. The park takes its name from a gorge through which a side branch of the Charles River once passed, whose ledges were, according to Eliot, \\"clothed with hemlocks\\". The side channel was cut off in the 20th century by the construction of nearby Interstate 95, and water flowing through the gorge now enters a holding pond, from which water is returned to the river when water levels are low. The main features are the steep Hemlock Gorge, the river, and Echo Bridge, a carrier of the Sudbury Aqueduct, which now forms part of backup systems of the Boston area water supply. The bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. A platform under the bridge's central arch lets visitors hear the echo that earned the bridge its name. There is direct access to the top of the bridge from the parking area. At the northern end of the park, just before the river flows under Route 9, it flows over a horseshoe-shaped dam constructed in the early 20th century at a site that housed a mill as early as the 18th century. Activities and amenities Picnic benches and trails for hiking are maintained. The park is open year round from dawn to dusk.

For the next three years, Webster worked with other ACTS instructors‚ÄîHarold L. George, Donald Wilson, Muir S. Fairchild, Haywood S. Hansell and Laurence S. Kuter‚Äîto determine how best to use precision bombing techniques that were under development to destroy small, vital enemy targets during the opening phase of a war, so as to hinder the enemy's potential to wage a lengthy war. Fairchild and Webster studied the interconnections between various industrial sectors of the United States to determine the most vulnerable nodes relative to attacking an enemy's industrial base. The two men compiled a list of critical targets that could incapacitate an enemy; targets that were organized with regard to available weapons. Webster wrote to a number of New York city and state agencies such as the National Board of Fire Underwriters, the Consolidated Gas Company and the New York City Board of Water Supply to determine the vulnerabilities of a large metropolitan area such as New York City. The resulting concept of points of vulnerability was called the industrial web theory.Faber, Lt. Col.

This set-up was prompted, in part, by the difficulties of transporting instruments while touring, and a desire to make it easier and more convenient. Musically, the style was suggested by vocalist Yasuko Onuki, who made some demos that featured only drums, a theremin and her vocals. As Onuki came up with the idea ahead of a planned tour with drummer Dave Witte, guitarist Ichirou Agata believed she wanted to highlight the speed of Witte's drumming by removing the guitars.

His period saw a tribal embryo of a state taking form in the highlands of Yemen, which would be strengthened by his successors as imams, and eventually usher into the expulsion of the Ottoman Turks in the early 20th century. Accession as resistance leader Sharaf ad-Din bin Muhammad bin Abd ar-Rahman was a 14th-generation descendant of a medieval imam, al-Mu'ayyad Yahya (d. 1346).http://www.hamidaddin.net/ftree/Zain13_AlHadiSharafaddin.htm (in Arabic). The line of descent is al-Mu'ayyad Yahya - Muhammad - Abdallah - Ali - Ibrahim - Muhammad - Abdallah - Ali - Muhammad - al-Hasan - Ahmad - al-Hasan - Abd ar-Rahman - Muhammad - al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din. He was born in Jeddah while his Yemeni parents performed the hajj, and received a thorough education in the Islamic sciences. The Ottoman Turks occupied San'a in 1872 and brought an end to the old Zaidi state which had existed since 1597. The Imam al- Mutawakkil al-Muhsin refused to submit. He tried to resist the Turkish troops with limited success until his death in 1878. After him, Sharaf ad-Din performed the da'wa (summoning, bid for authority) in Jabal Ahnun which was known as a stronghold for Sayyids and religious scholars. He was elevated to the imamate with the name al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din. He vowed to continue the struggle and moved to the city Sa'dah north of San'a. In Sa'dah he reinforced religious laws and encouraged qadis to act as judges and administrators in the nearby tribal areas. A fortress was constructed near the city, which became the seat of the imam's government.Vincent Steven Wilhite, Guerilla war, counterinsurgency, and state formation in Ottoman Yemen, PhD Thesis, Ohio State University 2003, p. 213-5. In Zaidi historiography, his name is sometimes ignored since he did not belong to the Qasimid family that usually provided the imams.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 92. He had at least one rival for the imamate, al-Mansur Muhammad (1853‚Äì1890). However, competition between the rivals was confined to verbal arguments.Wilhite 2003, p. 214. The rebellion of 1884 Turkish legislation by this time was influenced by European models. These so-called Tanzimat reforms were considered heretic by the locals of the Zaidi branch of Shi'a Islam. The pretender-imam was therefore able to keep up the struggle, although Yemen was too split along tribal and religious lines to launch a unified resistance. A concerted attack against the Turkish positions was launched in the summer of 1884, where al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din strove to subjugate the well-watered regions to the north-west of San'a.Wilhite 2003, p. 216. He extended his control to the areas around Hajjah and Zafir in the highlands. The Turkish troops besieged Zafir for seven months before the imam's followers withdrew.Caesar E. Farah, The Sultan's Yemen; Nineteenth- Century Challenges to Ottoman Rule. London 2002, p. 104. Setbacks and further struggle For a time, the Ottoman governor Izzet Pasha (1882‚Äì1884) was able to bring strong pressure on the imam. Izzet assumed control over as- Sudah and chased the imam from the strong fortress Shaharah, which was the key to Sa'dah in the north. The German traveller Eduard Glaser who visited Yemen in 1884 summarized the situation at that time, and described al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din as a leader of fanatics. At the time of his visit the area controlled by the Turks was restricted to a line between Luhayyah and Hajjah, together with Amran, San'a, Dhamar, Rada, Qa'tabah and the land between Ta'izz and Mocha. The highland tribes Hashid and Bakil were hostile to the Ottoman rule, as was the land to the east and north of San'a.Caesar E. Farah, pp. 105-06. Al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din finally died in Sa'dah in 1890, and was buried in Jabal Ahnun.Wilhite 2003, p. 213. In July in the same year the ulema appointed his brother-in-law Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din as their new imam, continuing the anti-Turkish struggle.Caesar E. Farah, pp. 158, 164.

For over a hundred years during the high point of the Industrial Revolution, it was the central harbour and trading point of the town. Since the mid 1960s, the importance of the harbour declined and it lay in a disused condition for 20 years, before plans for renovation were drawn up. This former industrial area has been fundamentally transformed, a process which started as a part of the International Building Exhibition Emscher Park (IBA) which ran from 1989 until 1999. The basis for this model of development in the Ruhr district was delivered in 1994 by the British architect Norman Foster. Since then, the Inner Harbor has transformed itself into a district combining employment, housing, culture and water-based leisure activities. Today, the Inner Harbour is both an industrial monument and a main stop on the Route der Industriekultur.  History  Where the Inner Harbour is today, the Rhine flowed many centuries ago. Up until the 5th century, the boundary of the Roman Empire ran through this locality. During the Middle Ages a Frankish regal court was built on the banks of the Rhine, today that place is occupied by the Rathaus. On the same area were to be found the old Duisburg town church, the Salvatorkirche, the market hall and the city walls. According to recent research, around the year 1000 the Rhine shifted its course westwards. Duisburg found itself no longer lying directly on the Rhine; it remained connected to the river only through a \\"dead\\" arm of the Rhine for the following 400 years. As a result, this previously important trading town declined into a small agricultural settlement. It was only in the 19th century that an initiative to resurrect the connection to the Rhine proved successful. Initially, the Outer Harbour was dug from the Rhine in the west as far as the contemporary Marientor Bridge, to which an eastern extension was later built, the Inner Harbour. Early on, the timber industry established itself on the harbour, mining interest being a major customer for their products then, as modern production methods were able to reduce their space requirements, grain mills began to establish themselves in several locations, along with their warehouses for storage. They conferred on the Inner Harbour the nickname \\"bread basket of the Ruhr district\\", supplying the rapidly growing population in the district. After the decline of the grain mills in the 1960s, the Inner Harbour lost its economic significance and was characterized primarily by warehousing. Nevertheless, the district still continued to block off access to the water from the city itself. The first steps in giving the inner harbour a new face were taken at the end of the 80s with the opening up of city walls and the construction of a new living quarter on Corputiusplatz. Within the framework of the IBA Emscher Park, which renovated the industrial areas of the Ruhr in an exemplary fashion, a transformation design for the entire Inner Harbour was launched. The water was to be re-incorporated into the city, it was to be made freely accessible and produce an enhanced quality of living ‚Äì and attract investors. Space for employment ‚Äì especially in the service sector ‚Äì for living, culture and leisure were to be integrated into the overall plan. In this sense, the industrial and historic \\"symbols\\" of the harbour were to be quite consciously retained.  The Inner Harbour today  Highlights of the newly renovated quarter of the Inner Harbour are the K√ºppersm√ºhle converted to an arts museum by Herzog & de Meuron, the Werhahnm√ºhle, which following the departure of the Children's Museum ATLANTIS is being used as a ‚ÄúLegoland Discovery Centre‚Äú, the Cultural- and City History Museum, the ‚ÄúGarden of Remembrance‚Äú laid out by Dani Karavan as well as the Synagoge of the Jewish District of Duisburg-M√ºlheim/Ruhr-Oberhausen, designed by the architect Zvi Hecker. Additionally, on the far side of the Garden a marina has been built complete with a Buckelbr√ºcke ('Buckle bridge' ‚Äì for pedestrians). It is intended to extend the marina into the adjacent Holzhafen. A lively dining- scene has also developed. In addition to more than 15 restaurants und clubs, there are also owner-run bars and franchises.  Progression of Developments  After a previous project had run into problems revolving around the awarding of the contract, 2008 should see an investor beginning the construction of Eurogate, a semi-elliptical multi-functional building with up to 10 floors and a floor area of about 35.000 m2. The design for this building, by Foster, follows the curvature of the Holzhafen. Works for reclamation of land on the bank hit the news when a crane overturned and burnt-out. Foster has - under contract from the City Council - come up with a new master plan, for the western part of the Inner Harbour, bordering directly onto the Altstadt. This master plan foresees a transformation similar to that which has been carried out in the eastern section ‚Äì which is itself still ongoing: A further area for a new building lies at the further end, near to the K√ºppersm√ºhle. The Museum K√ºppersm√ºhle has extension plans, following the need for more space due to the fusion of the Grothe und Str√∂her collections. Behind of the office building on the Northern bank, a park is envisaged. In order to coordinate the ideas of the planners regarding the Inner Harbour and the City Centre, the Innenhafen-Entwicklungsgesellschaft (Inner Harbour Development Society) will additionally manage the renovation of the entire City Centre. As from 2010 the Land Archive of NRW will be based in the Upper Harbour. Up until now it has been based in D√ºsseldorf (Main Archive) and Br√ºhl (Personenstandsarchiv Br√ºhl). In December 2007 the Austrian architects Ortner und Ortner received the commission for converting a listed storage building from the 30s.

He attended the Kansas City Art Institute, where he studied environmental graphics with Victor Papanek and was influenced by sculptor Dale Eldred, before completing a Fine Art degree at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City in 1978. He pursued graduate studies at the University of Texas, earning an MFA in Sculpture (1983) and minor in Mechanical Engineering; interdisciplinary work there with Peter Saul, Robert Yarber, and visiting professors John Baldessari, Vito Acconci and Siah Armajani influenced his understanding of the built world and use of social critique and humor. In 1983, Schafer moved to New York City and worked for artists Dennis Oppenheim and Alice Aycock; their use of research, historical and philosophical references, drawing, site specificity, and public scale also had a lasting impression on his work.Brenson, Michael. \\"City as Sculpture Garden: Seeing the New and Daring,\\" The New York Times, July 17, 1987.

He has also taught at Otis College of Art and Design (1996‚Äì2000), Cal Arts (2002), and Art Center College of Design (1998‚Äì2007), where as a full professor he developed a sculpture program bridging Fine Arts, Digital Media, and Environmental Design. After a return to New York and positions at Parsons (2007‚Äì10) and the Cornell Art and Architecture Program (2011‚Äì2), he returned to Art Center in 2013, where he founded and developed the school's Sound Lab in Fine Art program and sound curriculum. Work Because it is multidisciplinary, Schafer's work can be difficult to categorize; he has created sculpture, installations and public art projects that may incorporate built structures, printed and sound elements, and text, as well as sound works, all of which engage cultural and historical works, tropes and texts whose ideas he reconfigures visually, spatially or sonically for reconsideration. Artforum critic Jan Tumlir traces Schafer's artistic strategies to his emergence in the 1980s amid the theoretical flowering of deconstruction and its critical dismantling of historical and cultural conventions, including modernism. Sculpture and installations Schafer's early art explored relationships between public and private space and perception through site-specific works that implicated sculpture as a staged experience and disrupted exhibition/audience and viewer/art object conventions, often through physical engagement.Zimmer, William. \\"Sculpture Carefully Created for a Site,\\" The New York Times, June 28, 1987.

What Should a Painter Do? (2011) referenced a Barnett Newman painting series with text works, audio of Newman explaining his ideas, and a bare-bones, De Stijl-like sculptural installation. In both cases, the grand formalist theories referenced by the structures and recordings are undermined by garbled, chaotic soundtracks, suggesting alternative perspectives for assessing such claims to truth.

The installation reflected on the complexities and contradictions of liberty, juxtaposing the rote memorization, oversimplification, and commodification endemic to American patriotic discourse with the site's commemoration of revolutionary thought, speech and action. It featured billboards with enlarged croppings of the American flag and commercial trademark symbols, bold colors and forms alluding to Russian Constructivist Agitprop, and structural elements (boardwalk, bridge, picket fence) whose practical functions were undermined; the billboard insides reproduced flashcard-like definitions and questions about the Constitution and Bill of Rights taken from a high school textbook.

Sound works and performances Schafer has also created electronic noise and processed recordings, live signal manipulation, programming events and live sound performances under the moniker of DSE since 2009.

He has written more than twenty books, including Let's Face It!: Selected Poems 1974-2015. Early life Marin's family moved to Malibu in the 1920s, becoming one of the first residents of the new Malibu Movie Colony. A sensitivity to the beauty of nature, learned while hiking and surfing in this rural suburb of Los Angeles, has been a great influence on Marin's work, as have trips taken in his youth to countries like France, Switzerland, Greece and India. He has worked as a wine distributor since the 1980s, and wrote a wine column for LA Style magazine from 1986 until 1989. Cartoonist Rube Goldberg is his great uncle. Poetry Marin majored in American Studies, with a minor in Creative Writing/Poetry and French, at Stanford University (class of '78). He worked at the university's literary journal Sequoia, edited by fellow student Dana Gioia, who later served as a chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Among his professors were notable poets Timothy Steele, Alan Shapiro, and Donald Davie. Marin focused his studies on the works of Gary Snyder, Richard Brautigan, and Ezra Pound. His writing has been translated into Vietnamese and has been associated with the Vietnamese New Formalism poetry movement, a blending of Vietnamese poetry and American New Formalism. The colloquial style of Marin's poetry is easily accessible‚Äîand, at the same time, spontaneous and visceral. His poems often connect daily minutiae to existential dilemmas, as in The Problem with Oxnard, which he wrote from the perspective of Chicano farm workers. In books like Little Nuts (Brass Tacks Press, 2008), he champions a new form of short poem that seems to forgo all poetic devices: Painting Using traditional canvases‚Äîas well as the fronts of postcards, hotel stationery and small pieces of paper‚ÄîMarin paints with acrylic pens to produce contemporary, multi-colored abstracts, portraits, and landscapes. His work has been shown in galleries, and collected by celebrity inventor Ron Popeil among others. He cites as influences artists who \\"address the fragmentedness of modern existence,\\" such Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky, Jackson Pollock, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat and, most notably, Paul Klee. Marin's image entitled \\"Riven Rock\\" is now a wine label for Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon wine being sold under a private label of the same name at the grocery chain Whole Foods Market. Marin's apartment has been dubbed \\"The Palisades Art House\\" because of the thousands of paintings that crowd its walls, shelves, and floor. He hosts private tours to showcase his apartment as an art piece in itself. Marin's art hangs in many famous restaurants in the downtown Los Angeles area like Bestia. His art is handled by bG Gallery, Daniel Rolnik Gallery, and the Blooming Art Gallery. Additionally, it is on display at several Malibu businesses including SunLife Organics, Vitamin Barn, D‚ÄôAmores Pizza, Kaishin, Malibu Farm and Pacific Coast Greens.

Evansville Crimson Giants In 1921, the Crimson Giants' first year as a professional squad, Henderson led the team in total scoring by accounting for 29 of their 89 points on the season. Starting in four games that year as both a wingback and placekicker, Henderson accumulated four rushing touchdowns and five extra- point conversions. All four of his touchdowns came in the team's final game of the season, playing host to the Cincinnati Celts.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/teams/ecg/1921.htm According to ESPN Statistics and Information, Henderson was for 93 years the only NFL player to enter a game with no career touchdowns and finish that game with four or more. This feat stood independently until 2014, when it was matched by New England Patriots running back Jonas Gray in a matchup against the Indianapolis Colts. During a 1921 game against the Hammond Pros, Henderson stated that the Hammond players met with him during the game and asked if he could tone down his hits because the Hammond players still needed to be healthy for work on Monday. Henderson, a high school football coach, refused and stated that he needed to show his players, who were sitting in the stands watching him, \\"how tackling was done\\".

Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. in which Emperor Wenzong of the Chinese Tang dynasty, angry about the power that the eunuchs had, conspired with the chancellor Li Xun and the general Zheng Zhu to slaughter the eunuchs. The plot failed, however, when the eunuchs realized what was happening and counterattacked with soldiers under their command. Li Xun, Zheng, as well as many of their associates and other officials were slaughtered, and thereafter, the eunuchs had an even firmer control over Emperor Wenzong and his government than before.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 59, preface.  Prelude  Both Li Xun (then named Li Zhongyan) and Zheng Zhu were associates of the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng initially, and it was Wang who introduced both to Emperor Wenzong. Nevertheless, as, over the years, Wenzong showed signs of resentment toward the eunuchs, Li Xun and Zheng, particularly because they were not suspected by the eunuchs due to their association with Wang, began plotting with Wenzong to destroy the powerful eunuchs. As of summer 835, Li Xun and Zheng had persuaded Wenzong with a detailed plan that included a three-phase plan for him to pacify the empire ‚Äî first destroying the eunuchs, then recovering the lands lost to the Tibetan Empire, and then destroying the warlords north of the Yellow River. In the summer of 835, the plan began to go into action. Wenzong first diverted some of Wang's power by giving the command of one of the two Shence armies, under eunuch control, to Wang's rival, fellow eunuch Qiu Shiliang, and taking it away from another eunuch, Wei Yuansu (). Then, as Wei and the directors of palace communications (also eunuchs) Yang Chenghe () and Wang Jianyan () were also in conflict with Wang Shoucheng, to placate Wang Shoucheng and to eliminate Wei, Yang, and Wang Jianyan, Wenzong had Wei, Yang, and Wang Jianyan sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as eunuch monitors of three different circuits, and later ordered them to commit suicide. Also as part of the plan, Zheng was sent out of Chang'an as well to serve as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), so that Zheng could gather troops to use against the eunuchs. Li Xun and Zheng also had six eunuchs who had conflicts with Wang Shoucheng previously, Tian Yuancao (), Liu Xingshen (), Zhou Yuanzhen (), Xue Shigan (), Sixian Yiyi (), and Liu Yingchan (, final character not in Unicode) to be sent out of Chang'an to survey six remote circuits, planning to eventually send edicts drafted by the imperial scholar Gu Shiyong () to the six circuits to order them to commit suicide later. Meanwhile, in the winter of 835, under the advice of Li Xun and Zheng, Emperor Wenzong sent poisoned wine to Wang Shoucheng, as part of a plot to kill him. Under the next part of Li Xun's and Zheng's plan, as Wang was set to be buried on December 20, Zheng would bring his personal guards back to Chang'an to attend the funeral, which the eunuchs were all expected to be attending. Zheng's guards would then catch the eunuchs by surprise and slaughter them. However, Li Xun, who by this point was a chancellor and who actually had become jealous of Zheng, had different plans ‚Äî as he felt that this plan would in fact cause Zheng to receive all the credit for the plot. He thus decided to act before Zheng. To that end, Li Xun had Guo Xingyu () made the military governor of Binning Circuit (, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi); Wang Fan () made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi); Luo Liyan () made the acting mayor of Jingzhao; and Han Yue () made a general of the imperial guards; he had the four of them gather troops to be ready to act against the eunuchs. It was said that only Li Xun, Guo, Wang Fan, Luo, Han, Li Xiaoben () the deputy chief imperial censor, and fellow chancellor Shu Yuanyu were aware of Li Xun's plans.  Events  Initial launching stage by Li Xun and his allies  On December 14, Wenzong was hosting an imperial meeting at Zichen Hall () with the imperial officials. Han Yue, who was the general of the Left Jinwu Corps (), instead of giving the customary report that everything was well that the Left Jinwu and Right Jinwu generals were to give, instead stated that the night previous, there was sweet dew (, ganlu in Chinese) that descended on a pomegranate tree outside the Left Jinwu headquarters. He bowed to Wenzong, and the chancellors immediately led the other officials in congratulating the Emperor (as sweet dew was considered a sign of divine favor). Li Xun and Shu Yuanyu suggested that Wenzong go observe the sweet dews himself so that he could receive the blessings from heaven. Wenzong agreed, and the officials proceeded to Hanyuan Hall (), near the Left Jinwu headquarters. Wenzong himself took a litter to Hanyuan Hall. Once the Emperor and the officials arrived at Hanyuan Hall, Wenzong ordered the chancellors, as well as officials of the examination bureau (, Menxia Sheng) and legislative bureau (, Zhongshu Sheng) to examine the sweet dews at the Left Jinwu headquarters. After they did so, Li Xun returned and announced, \\"After we took our examinations, it appeared to me that those were not real sweet dews. This should not be announced immediately; otherwise, the empire would prematurely congratulate you.\\" Wenzong expressed surprise, and ordered Qiu Shiliang and fellow Shence Army commander Yu Hongzhi () to lead the other eunuchs to examine the sweet dews. After the eunuchs left Hanyuan Hall, Li Xun immediately summoned Guo Xingyu and Wang Fan to Hanyuan Hall and stated, \\"Be ready to receive the edict.\\" Wang was fearful, and he did not proceed into Wenzong's presence, but Guo did and knelt before the Emperor. Meanwhile, it was said that Wang and Guo had several hundred soldiers with them; initially, the soldiers stood outside Danfeng Gate (), outside Hanyuan Hall. Li Xun had them summoned inside Danfeng Gate to receive the edict, but only Wang's soldiers went in, and Guo's soldiers did not. Meanwhile, Qiu and the other eunuchs were at the Left Jinwu headquarters. Han, however, had become fearful and was nervous and sweating. Qiu began to sense that something was wrong. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew up a screen, and Qiu saw many armed soldiers and heard the sounds of clanging weapons. Qiu and the other eunuchs were surprised and quickly ran outside. The guards at the Left Jinwu headquarters were about to close the gate to close them in, but Qiu yelled at them, and they, surprised, were unable to close the gates. Qiu and the other eunuchs ran back to Hanyuan Hall, preparing to report to Wenzong what was happening.  Battle at Hanyuan Hall  When Li Xun saw the eunuchs running back to Hanyuan Hall, he yelled at the Jinwu guards for them to protect the emperor and promised them rewards. The eunuchs, however, yelled that there was an emergency and the emperor must return to the palace at once. They grabbed Emperor Wenzong's litter, put him on it, and ran north through the roped screen behind Hanyuan Hall (breaking the screen in the process) toward the palace. Li Xun ran after the litter and grabbed it, yelling, \\"I have not finished my report, and Your Imperial Majesty should not return to the palace!\\" At this time, the Jinwu guards were in Hanyuan Hall, along with the Jingzhao Municipal government police under Luo Liyan and office of imperial censors' guards under Li Xiaoben, attacking the eunuchs. More than 10 eunuchs were killed or injured, but this attack was unable to prevent the eunuchs from carrying Emperor Wenzong's litter through Xuanzheng Gate (), into the palace. Li Xun, who was still holding on to the litter, urged Emperor Wenzong to stop, but Emperor Wenzong yelled at him to stop yelling. The eunuch Chi Zhirong () battered Li Xun's chest, and Li Xun fell onto the ground. The litter then entered Xuanzheng Gate, and the gate was closed. The eunuchs were cheering. The officers lined up at Hanyuan Hall paused for a moment, and then fled. Li Xun, knowing that he had failed, put on a green uniform belonging to his staff members, got onto a horse, and fled, stating loudly on the road, \\"What crime did I commit that I am exiled?\\" No one on the road suspected him of being Li Xun. Meanwhile, Shu Yuanyu, along with other chancellors Wang Ya and Jia Su returned to the office of the chancellors, and believed that soon Emperor Wenzong would summon them to deal with the aftermath. When the officials under them came to inquire what had occurred, they told those subordinates to keep working and not to worry.  Slaughter of the officials  Meanwhile, by this point, Qiu Shiliang and the other eunuchs had realized that Emperor Wenzong was complicit with this plot, and they were openly cursing the emperor in his presence. It was said that Emperor Wenzong was so fearful that he was unable to speak. Meanwhile, Qiu and the other eunuchs sent the Shence Army officers Liu Tailun () and Wei Zhongqing (), with 500 soldiers each, armed with swords, to attack those they considered to be associates of Li Xun and Zheng Zhu. At that time, Wang Ya and the other chancellors were ready to have their regular lunch conference. A staff member informed them, \\"Soldiers are coming out of the palace and killing everyone they were meeting!\\" The chancellors, unable to get on horses quickly, fled on foot. The officials of the legislative and examination bureaus, and the Jinwu soldiers, numbering over 1,000 people, were also trying to flee, but they were bottlenecked at the gate to the office of the chancellors, and eventually, the gates were closed with some 600 of them still trapped inside, and the Shence Army soldiers slaughtered them. Qiu and the other eunuchs also sent Shence Army soldiers to close all gates to the imperial city and enter various governmental offices to attack the officials. It was said that the officials and their guards, and civilians who happened to be in the offices, were all slaughtered ‚Äî over 1,000 people. Various files, seals, books, and other equipment owned by the government were destroyed in the process. The eunuchs also sent cavalry soldiers outside the imperial city to try to capture those who had fled. Shu Yuanyu was captured after he changed into civilian clothes and got on a horse to flee out of Anhua Gate (). Wang Ya, who was in his 70s, walked to a tea shop at Yongchang District (), and was captured there. The soldiers took Wang to the Left Shence Army headquarters, where he was tortured. Wang, unable to stand the pain, falsely confessed that he and Li Xun were planning to overthrow Emperor Wenzong and support Zheng as the new emperor. Wang Fan fled back to his mansion at Changxing District (), and ordered the soldiers of Hedong Circuit to guard his mansion. When Shence Army officers arrived, they yelled out to him, \\"Wang Ya committed treason. The Emperor wants you to take over as chancellor, and Commander Yu wanted me to come give regards.\\" Wang Fan, believing them, exited his mansion, and the officers began to give him mock congratulations. Only then did Wang Fan realize that he had been tricked. The Shence Army soldiers also captured Luo Liyan at Taiping District (), and also captured Wang Ya's relatives and household servants, imprisoning all of them. Li Xun's cousin Li Yuangao () was killed. Meanwhile, the Shence Army soldiers were also pillaging wealthy households under the guise of searching for Li Xun's associates and the chancellors. For example, because Hu Zheng (), the former military governor of Lingnan Circuit (, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), was extremely wealthy, the Shence Army soldiers used the excuse of searching for Jia Su to enter his mansion, and they killed his son Hu Yin (). Similarly pillaged were the households of the officials Luo Rang (), Hun Hui (), and Li Zhi (). It was said that many street hoodlums also used this opportunity to take vengeance and to pillage.  Executions of Li Xun, his associates, and other chancellors  The morning of December 15, when the surviving officials were to enter the palace for the routine imperial gathering at Zichen Hall, the Jianfu Gate () was not opened until the sun rose, and the Shence Army soldiers guarding the gates allowed each official to only bring one attendant with them each. None of the chancellors or imperial censors was attending the meeting, and many other positions at the imperial gathering were also missing. When Emperor Wenzong inquired why the chancellors were not there, Qiu Shiliang responded, \\"Wang Ya and the others committed treason, and they have been arrested.\\" Qiu showed Wang Ya's confession to Emperor Wenzong, and further showed them to the Pushe (, heads of the executive bureau (, Shangshu Sheng)) Linghu Chu and Zheng Tan. Emperor Wenzong became saddened and angered when he read Wang Ya's confession and asked Linghu and Zheng whether this was Wang Ya's handwriting. When Linghu and Zheng confirmed that it was, Emperor Wenzong responded, \\"Then not even execution is enough for their crimes.\\" He issued an order that Linghu and Zheng take over at the office of the chancellors and handle the matters there, and that Linghu draft an edict to explain what had occurred (i.e., to declare the guilt of Wang Ya and the other chancellors). However, although Linghu did so, Linghu wrote the edict in dull language when describing Wang Ya's and Jia Su's alleged treason, thus angering Qiu. As a result, while, eventually, Zheng was made chancellor, Linghu was not. Meanwhile, the pillaging on the streets were continuing. The eunuchs ordered the Shence Army officers Yang Zhen () and Jin Suiliang () to take 500 soldiers each and take over security over the key streets of Chang'an. The soldiers beat drums to warn the hoodlums, and after killing some 10 hoodlums, the situation calmed down. Jia had changed into civilian clothes and hidden among the people, but after one night, he came to believe that there would be no way that he would be able to flee. He changed into mourning clothes and rode a donkey to Xing'an Gate (), informing the guards at Xing'an Gate that he was Jia, and asking to be delivered to the Shence Armies. The guards delivered him to the Right Shence Army. Meanwhile, Li Xiaoben changed into a green uniform (as Li Xu did), but continued to have on a gold belt. He covered his face with a hat and tried to ride a horse to flee to Fengxiang. When he was just west of Xianyang (, in modern Xianyang), he was captured by the Shence Army soldiers. On December 16, Zheng Tan was named chancellor. Meanwhile, Li Xun had fled to the Zhongnan Mountain () to try to seek refuge with the Buddhist monk Zongmi, with whom he was friendly. Zongmi wanted to give Li Xun a tonsure and disguise him as a monk, but Zongmi's followers urged him not to accept Li Xun. Li Xun thus exited Zhongnan Mountain and tried to flee to Fengxiang. He was, however, intercepted on the way by the defender of Zhouzhi (, in modern Xi'an), Song Chu (), who arrested him and had him delivered to Chang'an. When Li Xun's escort reached Kunming Pond (), Li Xun, fearful that the eunuchs would torture and humiliate him, told the officer escorting him to decapitate him so that the Shence Army soldiers could not seize him and take the glory themselves. The officer agreed and decapitated Li Xun, delivering the head to Chang'an. On December 17, Li Shi, who had been displaced by Luo Liyan as mayor of Jingzhao, was named chancellor as well as the director of finances. On the same day, a grand procession was held for the executions of the chancellors and the key associates of Li Xun. 300 soldiers from the Left Shence Army, holding Li Xun's head high in front of the procession, escorted Wang Ya, Wang Fan, Luo, and Guo Xingyu. 300 soldiers from the Right Shence Army escorted Jia, Shu Yuanyu, and Li Xiaoben. The officials were taken to the imperial ancestral shrines and the shrines to the gods of earth, and they were presented as if they were sacrificial animals. They then were paraded at the eastern and western markets of Chang'an. With the imperial officials ordered to oversee the executions, they were executed by being cut in half at the waist, and then their heads were cut off and hung outside Xing'an Gate. Their relatives, no matter how distantly related, were executed, including children, and some who had somehow initially escaped death were confiscated to be government slaves. It was said that during these few days, none of the decisions being made in Emperor Wenzong's name were actually made by Emperor Wenzong himself (or even known by him); rather, Qiu and Yu Hongzhi were making all of these decisions. On December 18, Gu Shiyong was arrested, even though the edicts that he had drafted ordering that the six eunuchs sent out to survey the circuits be forced to commit suicide were ignored by the six circuits receiving the edicts. Meanwhile, Zheng Zhu, unaware of Li Xun's actions and still acting on the original plan, had taken his guards and departed Fengxiang. When he got to Fufeng (, in modern Baoji), the magistrate of Fufeng County, Han Liao (), became aware of Zheng's plan, and therefore refused to supply him and fled to Wugong (Ê≠¶Âäü, in modern Xianyang). When Zheng received news that Li Xun had failed, he returned to Fengxiang. His subordinate Wei Hongjie () suggested to him that he kill the eunuch monitor of Fengxiang, Zhang Zhongqing (), as well as a number of officers, but Zheng, terrified, did not know what to do.New Book of Tang, vol. 179. At the same time, Qiu had an edict in Emperor Wenzong's name delivered to Zhang ordering Zhang to act against Zheng. Zhang initially also was not sure how to act, but under suggestion from the officer Li Shuhe (), Zhang invited Zheng to a feast. Li Shuhe gave Zheng's guards food and drink, and then, at the feast, while Zheng was not paying attention, killed and decapitated him. He then had Zheng's guards, Zheng's household, as well as a large number of Zheng's staff members, slaughtered. Zhang had Li Shuhe deliver Zheng's head to Chang'an, and Li Shuhe arrived there on December 20 ‚Äî where, on December 19 the eunuchs had readied the troops in case of an attack by Zheng, causing much panic in the people of Chang'an. Only after Zheng's head was hung on Xing'an Gate was it said that the people were calmed somewhat. Also on December 20, Han Yue was captured, and on December 21, Han was executed.  Aftermath  After the incident, the eunuchs, led by Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi, controlled the political scene completely for some time. When the six eunuchs who were almost forced to commit suicide returned to Chang'an, Tian Yuancao claimed that he was ready to slaughter the officials, and this led to another major panic at Chang'an. Only after Li Shi and the general Chen Junshang () remained calm were the people calmed. In spring 836, the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), Liu Congjian, submitted a harshly worded accusation against the eunuchs, claiming that the chancellors were innocent and that the eunuchs were guilty of grievous crimes. The eunuchs initially tried to placate Liu by having him bestowed with high honors, but he continued to submit accusations against them, particularly against Qiu. It was said that only after Liu's accusations did the eunuchs become somewhat apprehensive and allow Emperor Wenzong, Li Shi, and Zheng Tan some ability to govern. Still, it was said that after the Sweet Dew Incident, for almost the rest of Tang dynasty's history, the eunuchs were in firm control of the government, determining the successions of emperors.

The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company changed its name to the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for tax purposes to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare rubber vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels. Abir enjoyed a boom through the late 1890s, by selling a kilogram of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came at a cost to the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order. A series of reports into the operation of the Free State were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's Casement Report and followed by reports commissioned by the Free State and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.  Origins  Leopold II of the Belgians The Congo Free State was a corporate state in Central Africa privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium founded and recognised by the Berlin Conference of 1885.. What would later become Abir Company territory was the land between the Lopori and Maringa river basins, tributaries of the Congo River, in the north of the state. The local populace here were yam and cassava farmers who engaged in trade with river fishermen and pygmy hunters.. In 1885 a force of the Manyema people, followers of Tippu Tip, the Swahili-Zanzibari slave trader, arrived at the head of the Lopori River from Stanley Falls. They took hostages from nearby villages to ransom in return for ivory. By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin.. The Free State was concerned by this development and in 1889 had enacted the Monopoly Act which declared that all products in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone. The Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers, traders and the Manyema from the region, the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at Basankusu in May 1890. The campaign would be long but eventually successful and the entire basin was under Free State control by 1898. The Free State began using its new-found control of the region to levy taxes from the local population, gathered using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema.. The taxes were initially collected in the form of ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre.. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day.. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.  Establishment  John Thomas North King Leopold decided to give concessions of his territory to private companies who would then collect the rubber tax and export it. With this in mind he approached British Colonel John Thomas North, who had made a fortune through speculating on Chilean nitrates, for capital with which to fund a concession company. North agreed and provided ¬£40,000 of the 250,000 Belgian francs' (fr) initial investment.. As a result, the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (informally known as Abir) was established at Antwerp on 6 August 1892.. The company was divided into 2,000 shares of 500 fr value each. British investors (including North) held 1880 shares whilst Belgians held the remaining 120 shares. In addition to the 2,000 ordinary shares there were 2,000 \\"actions\\" which entitled the holder to a share of the profits after a 6% dividend was paid to the shareholders. The Congo Free State was the holder of 1,000 of these actions. In return Abir received exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and all land within twenty miles of eight designated posts and had police powers within the limits of the concession. The Free State also had to supply guns, ammunition and soldiers to help establish the posts. In preparation two State employees were ordered to establish a headquarters for Abir at Basankusu but this was barely begun before the local villagers rebelled against State rule and killed both men. Congo Free State concession companies, Abir shown in dark red The concession provided to Abir lay in the north of the country and was one of nine commercial concession areas established by Leopold in the Congo Free State. The concession was bounded to the north by the Congo River and the Soci√©t√© Anversoise concession, to the east by the Lomami River and the Lomami Company concession and to the west by the Lulonga Company concession which straddled the Lulonga River, into which the Maringa and Lopori flowed. To the south lay the Crown Domain (Domaine de la Couronne), the private property of Leopold, which comprised the best land in the Free State and was the richest in rubber.. The Abir concession included the Bolombo river, Yekokora river and Lomako river which were tributaries of the two main rivers. Each concession operated independently and exploited its own area commercially. The other main rubber companies in the Congo Free State were the Soci√©t√© Anversoise and the Lulonga Company but Abir was the largest in the country. Abir re-established their headquarters at Basankusu in 1893 and its position at the confluence of the Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way. Progress was slow as the Free State's activities had made the population in the west hostile to colonisation and the east remained in the control of the Manyema and the Zanzibari slavers.. The company's first post on the Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began only after a series of bloody conflicts between the villagers and Abir's men..  Post system  Abir company posts within the concession The post system was the cornerstone of Abir's commercial activity. Each post was run by one or two European agents to oversee local operations. The salary for an agent was 1,800 fr per year, sometimes increasing to 2,100 fr in the second year, and the standard contract period was three years. Agents also received 60 fr of trade goods each month with which to buy their food.. Despite the low wages the 2% commission that each agent received on rubber production made up the majority of the agents' pay, for example the agent at Bongandanga received 16,800 fr in commission in 1903. As a result, there were many applicants for each post and agents were hired with the expectation that they would increase production by 0.5‚Äì3 tons per month. This was implemented by extending the post to include more villages or increasing the quotas expected from the villagers, often indirectly forcing women and children to harvest the rubber as well. If production fell below the quota agents made up the shortfall in lost profits to the company from their pay. Each post consisted of a residence for the agent, barracks for armed sentries and sheds for rubber drying and storage, all built using labour conscripted from the villagers. A typical post employed ten African workmen to sort and dry the rubber, seven servants for the agent and thirty canoemen for local river transport. These were paid around 36.5 fr per year in goods, commonly 5 kg of salt, one blanket, five machetes and trade goods to the value of 6.35 fr. The post system was managed by the Director of Congo Operations at the central office in Basankusu. He was assisted in his job of keeping production up and expenses down by the only Free State employee in the concession, the commander of the police. The police commander was in charge of suppressing revolts and punishing villages which dropped below the quota. He had access to a large force of men and river steamers which was stationed at Basankusu and could redeploy quickly to the site of large scale rebellions. Effective police commanders would receive bonuses paid for by Abir. Each post maintained a census of all the males from the nearby villages to implement the tax which was initially set at 4 kg of dry rubber (8 kg of wet rubber) per man per fortnight. Each post had a force of 65‚Äì100 \\"village sentries\\", often ex-slaves armed with muzzle loading rifles, which resided in the villages to enforce taxation. The sentries were kept at the expense of the villagers and often used flogging, imprisonment or execution to keep production up. Sentries who failed to enforce the quota or made mistakes could be fined up to half their salary or fired, imprisoned or flogged. In addition to the village sentries were \\"post sentries\\" who were 25‚Äì80 men armed with modern, breech-loading Albini rifles who lived on the post and were used to punish villages and suppress rebellions. Sentries were paid similar wages to the post workmen and despite the strict working conditions it was a popular job as it offered a position of power over the other villagers. The sentries had their choice of food, women and luxury items and many left after a one-year term with five or six wives which they then sold. To comply with Congo law the company had to pay the villagers for bringing them rubber, these payments were often made in goods. Roger Casement, the British Consul in the Free State, recorded payments of a nine-inch knife of 1.25 fr value for a full basket of rubber, a five-inch knife worth 0.75 fr for a less full basket and beads worth 0.25 fr for a smaller amount of rubber.. Yet the main incentive for villagers to bring rubber was not the small payments but the fear of punishment. If a man did not fulfil his quota his family may have been taken hostage by Abir and released only when the quota was filled. The man himself was not imprisoned as that would prevent him from collecting rubber. Later agents would simply imprison the chief of any village which fell behind its quota, in July 1902 one post recorded that it held 44 chiefs in prison. These prisons were in a poor condition and the posts at Bongandanga and Mompono recorded death rates of three to ten prisoners per day each in 1899. Those with records of resisting the company were deported to forced labour camps. There were at least three of these camps, one at Lireko, one on the Upper Maringa River and one on the Upper Lopori River. In addition to imprisonment corporal punishment was also used against tax resisters with floggings of up to 200 lashes with a chicotte, a hippopotamus hide whip, being reported. Some agents would tie men to platforms facing the sun or burn them with gum from the copal tree as a means of punishment.  Boom and refounding  Abir profits 1892‚Äì1903, the line shows the general trend for missing data Abir collected 70 tons of dried rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 by which time it had eleven operational posts. At the same time the price of rubber also increased from 6.30‚Äì6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04‚Äì10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase the rubber from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on the rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram.. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of rubber, for the first two years (1892‚Äì94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year.. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due to the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.. The Abir Company entered liquidation in 1898 as a means of tax avoidance and to escape Belgian business regulations. It was immediately refounded in the Congo Free State as the Abir Congo Company. The name was no longer an acronym of Anglo-Belgian India Rubber and was instead a name in its own right. This change was because the company was no longer supported by British investment, partly because Colonel North had died and his heirs had sold their shares. The new company had a simpler shares system with just 2,000 shares (of 14,300 fr value each) divided between investors. The Free State held 1,000 of these shares. As Abir was now tax resident in the Congo the Free State received 2% of their profits through corporation tax, in addition to the 0.5 fr per kilogram export tax. All initial capital investments had been amortised by 1899 along with material expenses in Africa and property and equipment expenses in Antwerp. In 1900 Abir reached the boundaries of its concession which covered eight million hectares.. The next three years were spent filling gaps between existing posts and by 1903 Abir controlled 49 posts, managed by 58 agents. 1900 was Abir's most profitable year and the Congo Free State's shares and taxes provided 2,567,880.50 fr of revenue for the state, 10% of that year's total. The share dividend in 1900 was 2,100 fr, in the early 1890s it had been around 2 fr per share.  Decline and abuse of power  Baringa to make way for a plantation The rubber vine could be destructively harvested by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it lay on the ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession.. Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10 km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines. This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held more than one million plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure due in part to the fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper. Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons... By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants.. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.. The presence of Abir in the area exacerbated the effect of natural disasters such as famine and disease. Abir's tax collection system forced men out from the villages to collect rubber which meant that there was no labour available to clear new fields for planting. This in turn meant that the women had to continue to plant worn-out fields resulting in lower yields, a problem aggravated by Abir sentries stealing crops and farm animals.. The post at Bonginda experienced a famine in 1899 and in 1900 missionaries recorded a \\"terrible famine\\" across the Abir region. The modern descendants of Abir's villagers refer to the period of company control as \\"Lonkali\\", the period of famine. Disease was also a problem with smallpox moving in from the east being reported in the Upper Lopori in 1893 and reaching Bongandanga in 1901. A concurrent smallpox epidemic moving from the west destroyed villages along the Lulonga in 1899, and reached Basankusu in 1902. Sleeping sickness was also reported around the Lulonga by 1900 and spread up the Maringa and Lopori. Despite the arrival of these deadly diseases the main killers in the area were lung and intestinal diseases which killed twenty times as many people as smallpox and sleeping sickness combined. At least one missionary attributed the rise of disease with rubber collecting. Roger Casement, author of the Casement Report Abuses of power over the villagers by Abir had been reported by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 with the publication of a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.. It is also known that Abir had been forced to put down rebellions of the Yamongo, Boonde, Bofongi, Lilangi, Bokenda, Pukaonga and Kailangi peoples around the turn of the century and that five Abir sentries had been killed near Bongandanga in 1901 and 1902. The Boangi and Likeli peoples were forcibly resettled closer to the post at Bosow and in 1903 Abir troops intervened to stop the emigration of the Lika people and villagers near Samba. To stop small scale emigration Abir instigated a permit system for people wishing to visit another village. At the Momponi post the Abir agent led a punitive expedition against the Seketulu tribe which resulted in 400 civilian deaths with hundreds captured and put in prison, where a further 100 died. When the Nsongo Mboyo tribe attempted to emigrate 1,000 were captured and sent to a forced labour camp. The Likongo, Lianja, Nkole, Yan a-Yanju, Nongo-Ingoli, and Lofoma people all successfully fled toward Tshuapa. Despite this chaos Abir managed to increase its exports for 1903 to 951 tons recording the second highest profits in its history. However, this partial recovery did not last long and soon profits were falling once more.  Attempts at reform  Leopold was embarrassed by complaints made by the British government about human rights abuses in the Congo Free State and dispatched a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the entirety of the Congo. This commission visited the Abir concession from 1 December 1904 to 5 January 1905 and, despite Abir's attempts to keep witnesses away, heard evidence of violence committed by Abir. This included the desolation of villages, murder, rape, hostage taking and excessive flogging. Abir was the only commercial body mentioned by name in the report for brutality which said that the concession was \\"the black spot on the history of Central African settlement\\". The commission instigated limited reforms, laying down new interpretations of existing legislation which included a limit of 40 working hours per week for collectors, the option of paying taxes in commodities other than rubber and the removal of sentries from the villages. Two months after this Leopold sent a Royal High Commissioner to Abir to check that the reforms were being carried out, he was told that Abir had no intention of instituting any reforms. The commissioner established two deputy public prosecutors in the Abir concession but one investigated only missionaries and the second brought few cases against Abir men. One important result of the Congo Commission of Inquiry was that it spurred Leopold into carrying out reforms. One of the first stages of these reforms was Leopold's appointment of Richard Dorsey Mohun, an American explorer and soldier of fortune, as director of Abir. Mohun held a keen interest in the eradication of the slave trade and had worked for the US and Belgian governments, with his duties including the suppression of cannibalism and slavery in the Free State. He was given extensive executive powers and placed in a position of \\"unusual opportunity for the correction of past abuses\\". Despite this Abir's problems increased, the company reported an increase in rebellions against its rule and 142 of its sentries were killed or wounded during the first half of 1905.. An uprising at the post of Baringa resulted in the spearing of several sentries and the cutting off of food supplies to the Abir post. Abir's military forces proved insufficient to restore control throughout the spring and summer of 1905 and they were forced to call in state troops. Three European officers and their Free State troops toured the area threatening villages with recriminations if rubber was not harvested, but despite this the post recorded absolutely no harvest for 1905 to 1906. A similar event occurred at Mompono where around half of the population fled the area, those that remained being forcibly relocated closer to the Abir post.. The agent at Bongandanga tried to prevent a rebellion by reducing rubber collection from once per fortnight to once every three weeks. This was only temporarily successful and an Abir outpost was later burned down. The company, unwilling to admit falls in rubber plant stocks, publicly stated that the rebellions were fomented by missionaries. When Viscount Mountmorres visited the concession in 1905 he reported abandoned villages across the territory and that villagers had fled to the deepest parts of the forest to avoid Abir's taxes. These villagers were living in makeshift leaf shelters and with few comforts. By March 1906 Richard Mohun, Abir's director, admitted that the situation in the area was out of control and suggested that the Congo Free State should assume control of the concession. By September of that year Abir was unable to contain the increasing number of rebellions and, facing falling profits, was forced to completely withdraw from the area and hand control of the concession back to the Free State. At this point there were still 47,000 rubber collectors listed on the company's books. The other two major rubber companies in the Congo, the Soci√©t√© Anversoise and the Lulonga Company, also had their concessions taken back into state control in 1906.  Free State takeover and legacy  1905 cartoon of Leopold II with his private earnings from the Congo Free State The Free State was happy to take over Abir's concession as the State had built up sufficient income to be able to afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope that the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6 kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure. By 1901 there were so few rubber plants left in the concession that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber.. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Soci√©t√© Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government to reduce the size of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company. Abir's rubber gathering practices made it the most notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State.. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years.. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model was used by the French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.

He has been called the \\"earliest respiratory physiologist\\" of the hospital.John S. Logan Andrew George Malcolm 1818-1856 The Working Man of the Profession http://www.ums.ac.uk/malcolm_ag.html Today, he is mostly known for his reports on the sanitary state of Belfast and particularly for his History of the General Hospital. Malcolm is also considered to be the \\"first historian\\" of Belfast General Hospital. Early life and education Malcolm was born in Belfast in 1818 to Andrew George Malcolm, the minister first of Dunmurry and then of Newry, and Eleanor Hunter of Dunmurry. He was their fourth son. His father died when he was only five years of age. At the end of his schooling at Inst he had been assistant to Henry Montgomery, the famous headmaster of the English department and his father's successor at Dunmurry. It was there, at the medical school, that he would commence his medical training. Malcolm graduated from Edinburgh in 1842 at the age of 24. His thesis was on the pathology of continued fever and he received one of the three gold medals of the year. Medical career In 1843, Malcolm was appointed medical attendant to the Dispensary in Belfast, to attend the sick at the Dispensary rooms and in their own homes. In 1846 he was appointed to the hospital as physician, at the age of 28. From then on he was in regular attendance on the sick in the old hospital in Frederick Street. He lived nearby in York Street as those working in the medical profession did in those times. Apart from his general medicine, Malcolm had a class in skin diseases and was powerful and assiduous teacher. He says in his History, \\"Clinical instruction is not to be imparted by a careless walk through the wards. On the part of the teacher, the most patient, assiduous, vigilant, zealous and unceasing labour, and on the part of the pupil, the most rigid attendance, are absolutely necessary to develop the educational resources of a Hospital'. He was also a main contributor of specimens to the pathological museums of the Belfast Medical Society and the Belfast Clinical and Pathological Society, of which he was the founder. Writings While Malcolm wrote both medical and historical texts, he is primarily known for his historical writing and his records, which remain valuable historical sources today. During his time at the hospital, Malcolm wrote many reports on the sanitary state of Belfast. His reports were the result of several years of study of the housing, the water-courses, the sewers and drains of Belfast, the water supply, and the statistics or estimates of disease and mortality, some of which he had to compile for himself. Malcolm also published a statistical paper on the Influence of Factory Life on the Health of the Operatives, showing the harmful effect of flax dust on the lungs of the workers, and pleading for improvements in factory hygiene. There are two other major reports, among numerous lesser papers, one on the Asiatic cholera in Belfast (there were only 84 cases and Malcolm regretted the paucity of numbers) and one on the epidemic dysentery in the north of Ireland. In 1851 he published his History of the General Hospital at Belfast, which has become a valuable resource for the study of the sanitary state of Belfast during the famine.

It has since been collected and re-introduced in the November 3, 2015 anthology The Bazaar of Bad Dreams. In that introduction, King reveals that the poem is a revision of one he remembers writing in the late '60s, which was performed by a friend at a University of Maine gathering. The poem's narrative is told in the first-person vernacular of a bar patron, who, in exchange for memories, demands drinks of his unidentified listener. He describes a doomed expedition through the jungles of an unnamed land, at the end of which only a few of the once-large party have survived. Awaiting the survivors is a dark, mystical experience. Style The poem is related much like a regular narrative, as distinguished (by King himself in his prologue to it, for The Bazaar of Bad Dreams) from lyric poetry. It contains fewer than twenty stanzas and, although an occasional rhyme can be discerned, follows no standardised form, placing it in the category of free verse. The original late '60s version, since lost, was inspired, King says, by such Robert Browning narrative poems as \\"My Last Duchess\\". (Another Browning piece, \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\\", famously inspired King's self-described magnum opus, his Dark Tower series.) The poem's narrative style, of a man relating to a stranger the details of a macabre journey, has invited comparisons with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the plot of whose poem \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" follows a similar thread. The fearsome jungle setting and wildlife, on the other hand, has been compared to some of the poems and stories of Rudyard Kipling.

It was presented to the public on 30 June 1949, twenty-eight years after the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC). This speech is part of the fourth volume collection of his works, which was published by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing. It is noteworthy for its tone, that it preceded the freeze in Sino-Soviet relations following the Sino-Soviet split and adoption of Maoism in China, and that it codifies and embraces people's democratic dictatorship.  Speech Summary  The speech opens with an allegory that compares the CPC to an aging man. At twenty-eight years old, Mao states the childhood of the communist party in China is over and that one day the party itself will cease to exist, as an old man dies. He argues that the CPC is not an agent of its own sake, but an agent to bring about equality. Mao states that prior to China engaging in communism, it tried to learn from Western countries, as Japan; but that the Western imperialism made it impossible to do so. It wasn't that gaining from Western countries was impossible because they were formerly aggressive states (therefore requiring cognitive dissonance to even entertain the notion that democratic reform was desirable), but rather that it was due to ongoing aggression at the time that China was trying to modernize, thereby sapping the resources China needed in order to enact democratic reform and dissuading Chinese people from enacting similar forms of government. Mao then talks passionately about the early years of the Chinese communist revolution against Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang (the government of the Republic of China which ultimately relocated to Taiwan), and of destroyed and crumbling imperialist empires. He claims victory for Chinese communism, and welcomes former intellectual adversaries to \\"learn anew\\" and to warm to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, a brand of communism that focuses on centralism and expanding communism first to undeveloped countries. Mao credits the CPC for raising the standards of the working class in China and for its strong alliance with the USSR. This is notable because it precedes the Sino-Soviet split and Maoism as a distinct ideology. The speech then addresses some criticisms of the Chinese party: leftist extremism, aggression of the CPC, foreign relations, international communism, rejection of US and UK aid, cries of dictatorship. In Chinese there are two words that translate to dictator; the one that Mao uses has neutral connotations (\\"‰∏ìÊîø\\", which could be translated into: \\"monopoly on government\\" rather than \\"person who rules with an iron first and absolute power\\", the word used for dictator here). Mao addresses the fact that there is still some class division in China, and that only \\"the people\\" deserve benevolence; stating that peaceful \\"reactionaries\\" will be given some land and forced to work until they too become \\"the people\\". He further states that claims of totalitarianism from members of the United States are hypocritical, since American democracy is a lie perpetuated by the ruling bourgeoisie. Stressing the importance of the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, Mao calls for a common effort with urban bourgeoisie (a term used in this context to mean current communists, but former wealth holders) to organize rural production through regulated capitalism until final socialism can extend to agriculture. He warns that the bourgeoisie should not be allowed into powerful positions of the CPC, since they will likely corrupt it for personal gain. Mao ends the speech with a call for continued education, economic growth, and overcoming difficulties in the face of international opposition and for an embrace of USSR assistance in modernization.

In 1765 William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, brought against James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and the corporation of Carlisle bills in chancery for the perpetuation of testimony, believing that he was the owner of a fishery on the River Eden in right of the socage manor of Carlisle. However, because of the type of fishing carried on by the defendants it had become useless. Lonsdale's team discovered in the original grant from William III to the first Duke of Portland that the socage manor of Carlisle and the forest of Inglewood had been expressly omitted in the grant. An Act from the reign of James I, however, had laid down that the title for lands in undisturbed possession of over sixty years could no longer be challenged except by the Crown. In 1767, therefore, Lonsdale successfully petitioned the Treasury for a grant of Crown interest in the two properties \\"for three lives, on such terms as to their lordships should seem meet\\". Portland's allies claimed no land was safe if the legal maxim Nullum tempus occurrit regi (\\"No time runs against the king\\") was to be implemented. In February 1767, therefore, Sir George Savile introduced a Bill to abrogate the legal maximum and to abolish Lonsdale's rights. This was defeated by 134 votes to 114.G. F. R. Barker, \\"Lowther, James, Earl of Lonsdale (1736‚Äì1802)\\", Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1893, accessed 5 November 2009. In 1768 another Bill was introduced, this time including a clause that excluded all Crown grants made before 1 January 1769 from the operation of the Bill unless the grantees prosecuted their claims within one year. With the passing of this Act Lonsdale at once filed a bill against Portland and evicted three hundred tenants. However, the Court of Exchequer ruled against Lonsdale on the grounds that the grant was unlawful under the provisions of the Crown Lands Act 1702 because of the insufficiency of the rent reserved by the Crown. Portland's title to the socage manor of Carlisle and Inglewood forest was never tried and he eventually sold the properties to the Duke of Devonshire in 1787.

Signs and symptoms SIN is associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy, and may present as either. Pathology It is characterized by nodular thickening of the tunica muscularis of the narrow (isthmic) portion of the Fallopian tube. In severe cases, it leads to complete obliteration of the tubal lumen. It is uncommonly bilateral. Gross Findings: # One or more nodules 1‚Äì2 mm, spanning up to 2 cm # Smooth serosa Microscopic Findings: # Glandular epithelium within tubal muscularis propria, in continuation with mucosa or (more commonly) discontinuous # Haphazard distribution (akin to adenomyosis) or pseudoinfiltrative # Banal epithelium with tubal differentiation Diagnosis Hysterosalpingography, a common technique in the work-up of infertility, is reliable in the diagnosis of SIN, which is seen as small globular collections within the tubal wall, either discontinuous or in continuity with the tubal lumen. Tubal obstruction and hydrosalpinx are commonly seen as well. Other techniques include laparoscopic chromopertubation, salpingoscopy, and transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (the latter allows visualization of the tubal mucosa) Treatment Once suspected clinically and radiologically, patients with infertility and SIN can be managed with segmental resection with tubo-cornual anastomosis, and recanalization if tubal obstruction is detected. Success with gonadotrophin- releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a) has been documented in terms of remission of nodularity and tubal patency. If fertility preservation is not desired, salpingectomy is recommended.

Background  As a result of the 1990 United States Census, Texas was entitled to three additional congressional districts. In a called session in 1991, the Texas Legislature decided to draw one new Hispanic-majority district in South Texas (District 28), one new African-American majority district in Dallas County (District 30), and one new Hispanic-majority district in the Houston area (District 29). In addition, the Legislature decided to reconfigure an existing minority-majority district in the Houston area (District 18) to increase its percentage of African-Americans. The Texas Legislature had developed a state- of-the-art computer system, RedApl, that allowed it to draw congressional districts using racial data at the census block level. Working closely with the Texas congressional delegation and various members of the Legislature who intended to run for Congress, the Texas Legislature took great care to draw three new districts and reconfigure districts that the chosen candidates could win. The Justice Department precleared the plan under ¬ß 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and it was used in the 1992 election. Plaintiffs Al Vera, Edward Blum, Polly Orcutt, Ken Powers, Barbara Thomas, and Ed Chen challenged 24 of the state's 30 congressional districts as racial gerrymanders. A three-judge panel of the federal district, consisting of United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Judge Edith H. Jones, United States District Judges Melinda Harmon and David Hittner, struck down three Districts (18, 29, and 30) but the decision was stayed pending appeal, so the plan continued in use for the 1994 general election.  Opinion of the Court  The Court, in a plurality opinion written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, found that the plan was subject to strict scrutiny as it was an impermissible racial gerrymander. She repeated what the Court had said in Shaw v. Reno and Miller v. Johnson: Strict scrutiny applies where \\"redistricting legislation . . . is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles,\\" or where \\"race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines,\\" and \\"the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations,\\". The Court again held that strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race: that strict scrutiny does not apply in all cases of intentional creation of majority-minority districts, such as the compact districts created by a state court in California. But strict scrutiny does apply where race was the predominant factor in drawing district lines and traditional, race-neutral districting principles were subordinated to race. The Court found evidence that other factors, including incumbent protection, were considered. Outline of Texas' 30th Congressional District that was struck down in Bush v. Vera. The State argued, for example, that the bizarre shape of District 30 in Dallas County was explained by the drafters' desire to unite urban communities of interest and that the bizarre shape of all three districts was attributable to the Legislature's efforts to protect incumbents of old districts while designing the new ones. The Supreme Court upheld the district court's finding to the contrary, holding that race was the predominant factor, saying that \\"the contours of Congressional District 30 are unexplainable in terms other than race.\\" In applying strict scrutiny, the Court again assumed without deciding that complying with ¬ß 2 of the Voting Rights Act was a compelling state interest, but found that the districts were not narrowly tailored to comply with ¬ß 2 because all three districts were bizarrely shaped and far from compact as a result of racial manipulation. To the extent there was political manipulation, race was used as a proxy for political affiliation. It was race that predominated over all other factors. Justice O'Connor further noted that: \\"[B]izarre shape and noncompactness cause constitutional harm insofar as they convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial. . . . [C]utting across pre-existing precinct lines and other natural or traditional divisions, is not merely evidentially significant; it is part of the constitutional problem insofar as it disrupts nonracial bases of identity and thus intensifies the emphasis on race.\\" The court pointed out that, if the minority population is not sufficiently compact to draw a compact district, there is no violation of ¬ß 2; if the minority population is sufficiently compact to draw a compact district, nothing in ¬ß 2 requires the creation of a race-based district that is far from compact. A ¬ß 2 district that is reasonably compact and regular, taking into account traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries, may pass strict scrutiny without having to defeat rival compact districts designed by plaintiffs' experts in endless \\"beauty contests.\\" The Court found that the district lines were not justified as an attempt to remedy the effects of past discrimination, since there was no evidence of present discrimination other than racially polarized voting. Since racially polarized voting only served to make a case for a violation of ¬ß 2, and the plan was not narrowly tailored to remedy a ¬ß 2 violation, the bizarre shapes were not justified. The Court found that creation of District 18, the reconfigured African-American district in the Houston area, was not justified as an attempt to avoid retrogression under ¬ß 5, since it actually increased the African-American voting population from 40.8 percent to 50.9 percent.  Concurrences  In an unusual move, Justice O'Connor wrote a concurrence to her own opinion in which she expressed her view on two points: first, compliance with the results test of ¬ß2 of the Voting Rights Act is a compelling state interest, and second, that the test can co-exist in principle and in practice with Shaw v. Reno and its progeny. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who joined in the plurality opinion, wrote separately to express his view that anytime a district is drawn with a pre-ordained racial composition that strict scrutiny would apply. Justice Clarence Thomas issued a concurring opinion in which Justice Antonin Scalia joined which stated that \\"Strict scrutiny applies to all governmental classifications based on race, and we have expressly held that there is no exception for race based redistricting.\\"  Dissents  There were two dissents filed in this case, one by Justice John Paul Stevens in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined and one by Justice David Souter, in which Ginsburg and Breyer also joined.

It was designed and built by Slingsby Sailplanes for evaluation by the Royal Air Force. Design and development In the early 1960s the RAF issued a requirement to replace the current wooden gliders used by the Air Training Corps with a new tandem two-seater. Slingsby took the opportunity to design a new glider that would meet the needs of the ATC and could be used by civil gliding clubs. Slingsby decided to make the glider in metal, which would make it more marketable in areas like the United States and Australia where the traditional wooden gliders did not sell well. The glider would also be lighter and the labour costs would be less, although the cost of tooling would be higher. To gain experience the company purchased a kit of the Schweizer 2-22, which was then constructed to learn the techniques applicable to metal gliders. The construction of the prototype was started in June 1966, with the first flight on 9 March 1967 at Wombleton. The T.53 is constructed using a conventional light alloy flush-riveted design. To ensure the rear occupant is forward of the wing leading edge, the shoulder-mounted wing is swept forwards by 5 degrees. It has a high-mounted stabiliser. The Royal Air Force ordered 40 gliders, and the second T.53 was evaluated by them for use by the Air Training Corps. The order was cancelled following evaluation and the disruption caused when the Slingsby factory was destroyed by fire in November 1968. Following the fire, Slingsby built a small batch of modified T.53B aircraft, the Phoenix, for the civil market, and later sold the rights of the design to Yorkshire Sailplanes which then resumed production as the Yorkshire Sailplanes YS-53 Sovereign.

When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged.McLaughlin, p. 25 Russian companies could not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Chesma spent her career as part of the Black Sea Fleet. When the crew of the battleship mutinied in June 1905, the ship's crew was considered unreliable and she did not participate in the pursuit of the Potemkin. Chesma did, however, escort Potemkin as towed her back to Sevastopol from Constan»õa, Romania, where Potemkin had sought asylum. Chesma was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907. Before she was fully dismantled the Naval Ministry decided to use her hull for full-scale armour trials. She was re-designated as Stricken Vessel Nr. 4 on 22 April 1912 before being used as a gunnery target. Afterwards the ship served as a torpedo target for the destroyers of the Black Sea Fleet. During these attacks Chesma settled to the bottom of the Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid-1920s.  Design and description  Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1896 Chesma was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of more than than designed. She displaced at load, over more than her designed displacement of .McLaughlin, p. 21 Chesma had two 3-cylinder vertical compound steam engines imported from the Belgian Cockerill company. Fourteen cylindrical boilers, also imported from Cockerill, provided steam to the engines. The engines had a total designed output of , but they produced on trials and gave a top speed of almost . At full load she carried of coal that provided her a range of at a speed of and at .McLaughlin, pp. 21, 29‚Äì30 She differed from her sister ships mainly in her main armament. She had six Model 1886 35-caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts, two forward, side by side, and one aft. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30¬∞ across the bow and 35¬∞ abaft the beam, or a total of 155¬∞. The rear mount could traverse 202¬∞. They had a range of elevation from ‚àí2¬∞ to +15¬∞. Chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns as far as they could go to one side produced a list of 7.6¬∞ and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position.McLaughlin, pp. 26‚Äì27 This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list, but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill. The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance, but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate. Their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes, including training time. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. They fired a 'light' shell that weighed or a 'heavy' shell that weighed . The 'light' shell had a muzzle velocity of while the 'heavy' shell could only be propelled at a velocity of . The 'light' shell had a maximum range of when fired at an elevation of 15¬∞. The seven 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures, except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four five- barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes were mounted on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.McLaughlin, pp. 26‚Äì28  History  Chesma being used as a target ship in 1912 Chesma was named after the Russian victory at the Battle of Chesma in 1770. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, launched on 18 May 1886, and completed on 29 May 1889.McLaughlin, pp. 21, 30 She served with the Black Sea Fleet until 1907. She was inactive in 1895, probably for mechanical problems. Chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re-boilered the following year.McLaughlin, p. 30 Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced. The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armoured citadel that used Krupp armor. This proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled, but not before the armor and turrets had been ordered. Her turrets were used to equip the pre-dreadnought , then under construction.McLaughlin, pp. 150, 157 When the crew of the battleship mutinied in June 1905, Chesmas crew was considered unreliable, and she did not participate in the pursuit of Potemkin. She escorted Potemkin as towed her back to Sevastopol from Constan»õa, Romania, where Potemkin had sought asylum. The ship was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907. Before she was fully dismantled the Naval Ministry decided to use her hull for full-scale armour trials. She was re-designated as Stricken Vessel Nr. 4 on 22 April 1912. Chesma was fitted with a replica of the armour system used in the s to test its effectiveness. She was towed into position and given a 7¬∞ list to simulate the descent angle of shells fired at long range. Ironically her own guns were used against her as Ioann Zlatoust anchored away and fired 12-inch, and 6-inch shells with reduced charges to simulate shells fired from approximately away. These revealed significant weaknesses in the support structure for the armour plates and in the deck protection, but the Gangut-class ships were too far along in construction to incorporate fixes.McLaughlin, pp. 247‚Äì48 Afterwards she served as a torpedo target for the destroyers of the Black Sea Fleet. During these attacks she settled to the bottom of the Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid-1920s.

Minnesota House of Representatives Dill was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2002 and re-elected every two years until his death in 2015. He served as chairman of the Iron Range Legislative Delegation during the 2005‚Äì2006 biennium. Personal life During the summer months, Dill spent time in northwestern Ontario tending to his business, Thunderhook Fly-Ins. Dill was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in his early 20s. He later acknowledged that he did not look after his health, allowing his weight to surpass 300 pounds. In 2008, Dill underwent gastric bypass surgery, losing more than 150 pounds. As a result of diabetic nephropathy, Dill eventually had only 15% renal function and needed to go on dialysis or have a kidney transplant. He was hoping for a transplant from his sister. Dill announced that he nevertheless intended to run for re-election. On October 12, 2010, he received a kidney transplant at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. The transplant was successful. He later had a pacemaker installed to treat an irregular heartbeat. Death Dill was hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in mid-July 2015 to undergo chemotherapy. He died on August 8, 2015, of cancer at the age of 60 at Camp Thunderhook in Armstrong, Ontario. A funeral service was held on August 15 at the Backus Community Center in International Falls, Minnesota. References External links * Rep.

The group is stationed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. During World War II as the 1st Combat Cargo Group, the group fought in the China-Burma-India Theater transporting supplies and reinforcements to and evacuating casualties flying combat operations in Burma and China assigned to the Tenth Air Force. After the war, the unit was redesignated as the 512th Troop Carrier Group (Medium) and allotted to the reserve. Overview The unit is the operational component of the 512th Airlift Wing, and consists of 2 airlift squadrons and 2 support squadrons. Members of the group work side-by-side with their active duty counterparts in the 436th Airlift Wing.

Moved to the CBI theater in August 1944. Began operations in September 1944 by transporting supplies and reinforcements to and evacuating casualties from Imphal, Burma. Continued to support Allied operations in Burma, flying in men and supplies from India, moving equipment required to construct and operate airstrips, dropping dummy cargoes to lead the enemy away from Allied offensives, dropping paratroops for the assault on Rangoon (May 1945), and evacuating prisoners of war who were freed by Allied advances. Meanwhile, part of the group had been sent to China, and for a short time (December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945) the group's headquarters was located there. Operations in China included helping to evacuate the air base at Kweilin during a Japanese drive in September 1944, moving Chinese troops, and flying many supply missions, some of which involved ferrying gasoline and materiel over The Hump from India. The group, partially re- equipped with C-46 Commandos in June 1945, engaged primarily in transporting men, food, arms, and ammunition until the end of the war. Redesignated 512th Troop Carrier Group in September 1945. Returned to the US in December 1945. Inactivated on 24 December 1945. Activated on 2 September 1949. Equipped with C-46's. Between September 1949 and March 1951, and again from June 1952 ‚Äì April 1959, trained as a Reserve troop carrier group at bases in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Activated as a result of the Korean War in 1951, personnel and equipment reassigned to active duty units in Far East Air Force to support combat operations. Unit inactivated then reconstituted as a reserve unit in 1952. Inactivated in 1959 when parent wing implemented tri-deputate organization and all operational flying squadrons reassigned directly to the wing. Activated in 1992 when parent wing implemented objective organization. Since reactivation in August 1992 coordinated operations of C-5 squadrons. Personnel and squadrons of the group participated in various contingency and humanitarian airlift operations, some to Asia and Africa and in support of Global War on Terrorism since 11 September 2001.

It grows in relatively deep, still or slow- flowing, calcareous freshwater habitats. Description Shining pondweed is a large plant with robust creeping rhizomes and long, terete, branching stems, typically up to 2.5 m but exceptionally to 6 m. The leaves are large, 75‚Äì200 mm (exceptionally more) long and 25‚Äì65 mm wide, 2-6 times as long as broad; as with the smaller P. gramineus, the leaves on the branches are smaller than those on the main stem. The leaves are pale green or yellowish, translucent, shiny with distinctive netted veining, minutely denticulate margins, and a short petiole of 1‚Äì12 mm. Floating leaves are absent. Flowers appear between June and September. The fruits are 3 mm across. Like most other broad-leaved pondweeds, Potamogeton lucens is tetraploid, with 2n=52. Over much of its range, shining pondweed is not likely to be confused with any other species. However, in southern Europe the related and quite similar P. schweinfurthii has recently been discovered. P. lucens can usually be distinguished by its relatively broader leaves, 2-6 times as long as they are broad, and most or all of which are petiolate, but some forms are very difficult to distinguish without a detailed comparison of multiple characters. However, there are hybrids with various other pondweed species including P. gramineus (P. √ó angustifolius J.Presl.), P. perfoliatus (P. √ó salicifolius Wolfg.), P. alpinus (P. √ó nerviger Wolfg.), P. nodosus (P. √ó subrufus Hagstr.) P. sarmaticus (P. √ó pseudosarmaticus Papch.), P. crispus (P. √ó cadburyae Dandy & G.Taylor), P. praelongus (P. √ó jutlandicus Zalewska-Ga≈Ç.) and P. natans (P. √ó fluitans Roth). It hybridises with P. wrightii (P. √ó inbaensis Kadono)in Japan and China. Some of these hybrids can be quite common, and are not always easy to distinguish from P. lucens. A triple hybrid, P. gramineus √ó lucens √ó perfoliatus (P. √ó torssandrii (Tiselius) D√∂rfler), is also known. Taxonomy Potamogeton lucens (lucens meaning 'shining') was one of the original species named by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum (1753). Shining pondweed is morphologically quite variable, and as a result has received a bewildering number of synonyms. DNA analysis indicates that P. lucens is one of the broad- leaved pondweed clade (section Potamogeton) and is probably most closely related to P. gramineus and the North American P. illinoensis. Distribution Potamogeton lucens is native to Europe (including Britain, continental Europe, Scandinavia), Asia (Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), the Middle East and North Africa. In North America it is replaced by the rather similar P. illinoensis. Detail of stem and leaves Biochemistry A furanolabdane diterpenoid extracted from P. lucens is algicidal. Dried and ground shining pondweed has been shown to be effective at binding heavy metals, raising the possibility of using biomass from this plant as a means of treating contaminated sediments. Ecology and conservation Potamogeton lucens is strictly a lowland plant of standing or slow-flowing calcareous water, especially favouring peatland areas with a calcareous water supply such as the Cambridgeshire Fens. Although having a preference for deep water (0.5-2.0 m), it can persist in shallow areas, and may also grow in open reedbeds, which may provide a refuge in eutrophic waters. Shining pondweed is more prevalent in older, poorly connected floodplain lakes and is a poor colonizer, slow to regenerate following floods and intolerant of drawdown. In Britain shining pondweed is mainly restricted to southern England with scattered outposts in Scotland and Wales, but is more widespread in Ireland. It is tolerant of eutrophication to some extent and in marl lakes it may replace Chara spp. as nutrient levels increase, before itself being ousted by fine-leaved pondweeds and eventually phytoplankton at higher nutrient levels. In a study of nutrient-rich river backwaters in the R. Tisza (Hungary), shining pondweed was tolerant of very high phosphate concentrations, so long as chemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the water were not too high. In the Netherlands, the invasive Elodea nuttallii may compete with it for habitat. Globally and on the majority of national Red Lists, shining pondweed is not considered threatened. P. lucens has declined somewhat in Britain, but still remains reasonably widespread. Shining pondweed is one of the so-called Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion'. Potamogeton lucens, general habit Cultivation Shining pondweed is rarely cultivated, even though it is both easy to grow and an attractive plant. Its distinctive, large, transparent netted leaves are unlike any other commonly cultivated pond plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even in a barrel, but unlike some other submerged plants needs to be able to root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Plants being established should be weighted down initially to allow them to root. Where waterfowl grazing is likely, protection will be necessary, especially in the early summer growth period.

Its buildings are based over two sites that were previously used as a teacher training college (formerly known as Upper School, now the South Site) and a primary school (formerly known as Lower School, now the North Site and occupied by the sixth form). In 2009, its sports hall was built using 40 old freight containers, a construction that was subsequently awarded the British Construction Industry Award.  History  The school takes its name after Irish liberal peer, the Earl Of Dunraven who, as part of his strategy to represent the area in parliament in the 1920s, gave a donation which resulted in the purchase of a plot of land in the then Leigham Court Estate, which was used to house a school. In the 1960s, the school extended to nearby Mount Nod Road and in 1970 the Adare Walk site transferred to occupy the Philippa Fawcett Teaching College site on Leigham Court Road, which continues to be Dunraven's Science, Technology, Drama and Cafeteria block. During the 1980s, Richard Townsend became headmaster, and in 2004, he was succeeded by David Boyle. Prior to 2004, there were five permanent exclusions per year. This then dropped to zero. The number of temporary exclusions also has dropped from 510 before 2004 to 10. In 2011, the school became an Academy and was designated as a Leading Edge School and a National Support School. In 2013, it became an all-through school, with children being able to start in Reception. The following year, the education watchdog Ofsted judged Dunraven as ‚Äòoutstanding‚Äô overall, and in 2016, it was designated as a National Teaching School. That same year, the Dunraven Educational Trust was established and two years later it commenced work with two primary schools.  Construction of sports hall  Image of the sports hall. In 2008, Container City was commissioned by the London Borough of Lambeth, with funding from the Building Schools for the Future scheme, to construct Dunraven's full-height sports hall. Made using old 40 freight containers, it took three months to build, with its containers being modified off site, and three days to install, the first of its type in the world, and built with little disruption to school life. Similar sports halls were subsequently built in India, China, Norway, USA and Nigeria. Over its three storeys, it has a full sized basketball court, three sides of viewing galleries and two changing rooms. It is also connected to the school's rainwater harvesting facility, and has lighting controlled by motion sensors a heating system controlled by the weather. In 2009, the school was awarded the British Construction Industry Award and the Small Building Project Award. It was also a finalist in that years Prime Minister's award for Better Public Building and the 2010 Public Building Project of the Year.  Admissions  The admissions policy at Dunraven was based on whether the applicant had a sibling at the school, social factors, medical need and how far away the applying student lived. By 2005, it had introduced an admissions test, placing pupils in one of five ability bands and subsequently taking one-fifth of its annual intake from each of these bands. Then the three traditional admissions criteria apply. In the same year the school had 1 200 pupils and was visited by Tony Blair to see how its admissions process worked.  Primary school  For junior admissions, a Common Application Form (CAF) from the applying student's Local Authority is required. An additional Supplementary Information Form (SIF) is required if the child is out of age group or a deferred entry, or if any of the priority admissions criteria apply: * Looked after children * Siblings * Medical and/or social reasons * Children of staff at the school  Secondary school  For secondary school admissions, both the CAF and the SIF are required.

History The Anniston Academy was founded as a secondary institution in 1963 and renamed in 1976. The present Lower Division was founded as The Episcopal Day School in 1961 as an independent elementary school. Housed originally in the facilities of the Church of St. Michael and All Angels, the school moved into Grace Episcopal Church in 1967. In 1970, headmaster Allan Strand attributed the school's growth to white parents fleeing racially integrated public schools. In 1976, Anniston Academy was primarily white but had several black students. In 1976 the name was changed to The Donoho School in recognition of Mrs. Harriet Wallis Donoho, a founder and benefactor of the school. In 1983, then headmaster Tom Potts said they the name change was also motivated by a desire to distance the school from similarly named all white segregation academies that had opened in other Alabama cities In the summer of 1976, The Episcopal Day School merged with The Donoho School and became the Lower Division. In 1980 the Lower and Middle Divisions moved into a new facility constructed on the Donoho campus and The Donoho Upper School divided to become a Middle Division, containing grades seven and eight, and an Upper Division for grades nine through twelve. In 1981, the headmaster said the school not a segregation academy and would like to enroll more black students. In 1989, the Middle Division moved into a new facility constructed adjacent to the Upper Division. This expansion allowed the school to offer two sections per grade in kindergarten through grade twelve. Further additions in the early childhood department have brought the school to its current status of two sections in pre-kindergarten through grade twelve.

It is the only left-hand drive Rolls-Royce with landaulet (landaulette) coachwork where the rear part of the roof can be folded down. Its chassis number is LGLW 24, which has the following meaning ‚Äì L for left-hand drive, G for 1958, LW for long wheelbase (3.38m instead of 3.23m), and 24 is the sequence build of the series. The coachwork is by Park Ward.

In addition, at the right armrest, there are three grooves to hold a notebook, a make-up mirror and a cigarette case. The car has been used mainly for state visits, being used for the first time for the state visit to the Netherlands by Queen Elizabeth II, on 20 March 1958. Other royal visitors who used the car include Baudouin of Belgium, the Shah of Persia and his wife Farah Dibah, the King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej and his wife Sirikit, the kings of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, other heads of state, ambassadors, etc. Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus also used the Rolls-Royce on their tour of Dutch provinces and towns following their engagement in the autumn of 1965. At the end on the 1970s, it was decided that the Rolls-Royce would no longer be used for official functions. At first, it was kept in the garage of the Soestdijk Palace, then later it went to the Royal Mews in The Hague. The car was sold in 1979 to a private car rental firm.

Elephant Records Inc. It contains a total of eight cassettes released under their own Elephant Records label. Each cassette contains between ten and twenty songs, all from previous Sharon, Lois & Bram albums. Each cassette has a central theme. History & releases The cassettes were originally released after the trio's 1988 Happy Birthday album. They were available in stores in 1989 and came out in two sections. Volumes 1 through 4 were released in 1989, and volumes 5 through 8 were released in 1990. These original releases were used to promote their Sing A to Z tour and album. These included: Volume 1: Summertime Volume 2: Animals Volume 3: Around the World Volume 4: Sleepytime Volume 5: Elephant Showstoppers Volume 6: School Days Volume 7: After School Volume 8: Naming Names Some of the cassettes featured dialogue between Sharon, Lois & Bram introducing the next song or saying a rhyme or riddle. These were recorded specially for the cassettes. These eight original cassettes were available only in Canada. In 1995, with the upcoming release of their album Let's Dance! (which would become one of their best-selling albums), the trio decided to re-release four of the eight original Car Tunes cassettes to promote the album. These cassettes remained under the same name, but the volume numbers changed. They were released in partnership with Sears KidVantage program and were available at all Sears locations and stores throughout Canada and the United States. They were sold at $2.99 each and all the proceeds from the cassettes were sent to UNICEF, of which the trio have been ambassadors to since 1988. The 1995 Sears KidVantage Car Tunes Series featured the following four albums: Volume 1: Songs for After School Volume 2: Songs from Around the World Volume 3: Songs about Animals Volume 4: Songs for Sleepytime Packaging The original release of the 8-volume set was designed to embrace the \\"car tunes\\" theme. It featured the front bumper of a car with the license plate containing the trio's names & the Car Tunes logo. A yield sign featured the volume number of each cassette, and a stop sign featured the number of songs found on each cassette and the name of each volume. It also contained a one-way sign listing two songs that could be found on the albums. The cover unfolded to reveal that Sharon, Lois & Bram are driving the car. The inside flap featured a black and white collage of the trio's albums until 1988 and the text, \\"treat yourself to all the fun you can sing... with Sharon, Lois & Bram's full length records and tapes.

HPA is a systematic technique for reducing hydrogen consumption and hydrogen generation through integration of hydrogen-using activities or processes in the petrochemical industry, petroleum refineries hydrogen distribution networks and hydrogen purification. Principle A mass analysis is done by representing the purity and flowrate for each stream from the hydrogen consumers (sinks), such as hydrotreaters, hydrocrackers, isomerization units and lubricant plants and the hydrogen producers (sources), such as hydrogen plants and naphtha reformers, streams from hydrogen purifiers, membrane reactors, pressure swing adsorption and continuous distillation and off-gas streams from low- or high-pressure separators. The source-demand diagram shows bottlenecks, surplus or shortages. The hydrogen pinch is the purity at which the hydrogen network has neither hydrogen surplus nor deficit. After the analysis REFOPT from the Centre for Process Integration at The University of Manchester is used as a tool for process integration with which the process is optimized.REFOPT The methodology was also developed into commercial software by companies such as Linnhoff March and AspenTech. The Aspen product incorporated the work of Nick Hallale (formerly a lecturer at University of Manchester) and was the first method to consider multiple components, rather than a pseudo-binary mixture of hydrogen and methane. History The first assessment based on cost and value composite curves of hydrogen resources of a hydrogen network was proposed by Tower et al. (1996). Alves developed the hydrogen pinch analysis approach based on the concept of heat pinch analysis in 1999.Multi-period hydrogen management Nick Hallale and Fang Liu extended this original work, adding pressure constraints and mathematical programming for optimisation. This was followed by developments at AspenTech, producing commercial software for industrial application.

She was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907.

She had a beam of and a draft of , more than designed. Her displacement was at load, almost more than her designed displacement of . Ekaterina II had two 3-cylinder vertical compound steam engines built by the Baltic Works. Fourteen cylindrical boilers, also built by the Baltic Works, provided steam to the engines. The engines had a total designed output of , but they produced on trials and gave a top speed of . At full load she carried of coal that provided her a range of at a speed of and at . Ekaterina II differed from her sisters mainly in her gun mounts. Her guns used bulky, hydraulically powered Moncrieff disappearing gun mounts. They had a rate of fire of five minutes, ten seconds between aimed rounds. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30¬∞ across the bow and 35¬∞ abaft the beam, or a total of 155¬∞. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. The seven Obukhov Model 1877 35-calibre guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures, except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. Six of the eight five-barrelled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in small sponsons that projected from the hull with the aftermost pair mounted in embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four five-barrelled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes mounted on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel and the seventh tube was in the stern.  History  Ekaterina II was named after the Empress Catherine II of Russia. She was the only one of her class to be built by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolaev. The ship was laid down on 26 June 1883, launched on 20 May 1886, and completed in 1889. She ran her first trials in 1888, after she had been transferred to Sevastopol to be fitted out, and spent her career with the Black Sea Fleet. In 1897 the Naval General Staff proposed to re-gun her with more powerful 12-inch 40-calibre guns and to replace the compound armour of her redoubt with Krupp armor, but this proved to be too expensive. Her machinery was upgraded between mid-1898 and 1902. Her boilers were replaced with eighteen Belleville water-tube boilers and her engines were converted to triple expansion.

He was the first foreigner to report on the Chinese famine of 1942‚Äì43 and helped the famine to catch Chinese and international attention.White, Theodore Harold.(1943). Until the Harvest Is Reaped, Time, March 22, 1943, P.19 Early life White was born May 6, 1915, in Dorchester, Boston, the son of David White, a lawyer. He was raised Jewish. In his memoir In Search of History: A Personal Adventure, White describes helping form one of the early Zionist collegiate organizations during his time in college.White, Theodore H. In Search of History: A Personal Adventure He was a student at Boston Latin School, from which he graduated in 1932; from there, he went on to Harvard University, from which he graduated with a B.A. in Chinese history as a student of John K. Fairbank, who went on to become America's foremost China scholar. He wrote for The Harvard Crimson during his time at Harvard. China Awarded a traveling fellowship for a round-the- world journey, White ended up in Chungking (Chongqing), China's wartime capital, and later became a freelance reporter after briefly starting out with the only job he could find: as an advisor to China's propaganda agency. When Henry R. Luce, the China-born founder and publisher of Time magazine, learned of White's expertise, he hired him and then came to China the following year, where the two became friends. White became the China correspondent for TIME during World War II. White chafed at the restrictions put on his reporting by the censorship of the Nationalist government, but he also chafed at the rewriting of his stories by the editors at TIME, one of whom was Whittaker Chambers. Although he maintained respect for Henry Luce, White resigned and returned home to write, along with Annalee Jacoby, widow of fellow China reporter, Mel Jacoby, a book about China at war and in crisis, the best- selling Thunder Out of China. The book described the incompetence and corruption of the Nationalist government and sketched the power of the rising Communist Party. The introduction warned, \\"In Asia there are a billion people who are tired of the world as it is; they live such terrible bondage that they have nothing to lose but their chains.... Less than a thousand years ago Europe lived this way; then Europe revolted... The people of Asia are going through the same process.\\" During the war, White had gotten to know and respect General Joseph Stilwell, the American commander in Asia. He sympathized with Stilwell's disgust with Chiang Kai-shek's unwillingness or inability to wage all-out war on the Japanese invader. Stilwell died shortly after the war, and Stilwell's widow called White to her home in Carmel, California and asked him to undertake the job of putting the General's papers into publishable form. White succeeded in seeing The Stilwell Papers through to publication. He also witnessed and reported on the famine that occurred in Henan in 1943. White then served as European correspondent for the Overseas News Agency (1948‚Äì50) and for The Reporter (1950‚Äì53) White returned to his wartime experience in the novel The Mountain Road (1958), which dealt with the retreat of a team of American troops in China in the face of a Japanese offensive provoked by bombings by the 14th Air Force. The novel was frank about the Americans' conflicting, sometimes negative attitudes toward their Chinese allies. It was made into the antiwar movie a 1960 movie, starring James Stewart and Lisa Lu. The McCarthy period made it difficult for any reporter or official who had had any contact with communists, however innocent, to escape suspicion of communist sympathies. White opted to turn from writing about China to take up reporting on the Marshall Plan in Europe and then ultimately to the American presidency. Making of the President series With experience in analyzing foreign cultures from his time abroad, White took up the challenge of analyzing American culture with the books The Making of the President 1960 (1961), The Making of the President 1964 (1965), The Making of the President 1968 (1969), and The Making of the President 1972 (1973), all analyzing American presidential elections. The first of these was both a bestseller and a critical success, winning the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. It remains the most influential publication about the election that made John F. Kennedy the President. The later presidential books sold well but failed to have as great an effect, partly because other authors were by then publishing about the same topics, and White's larger-than-life style of storytelling became less fashionable during the 1960s and '70s. A week after the death of JFK, Jacqueline Kennedy summoned White to the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port to rescue her husband's legacy. She proposed that White prepare an article for Life magazine drawing a parallel between her husband and his administration to King Arthur and the mythical Camelot. At the time, a play of that name was being performed on Broadway and Jackie focused on the ending lyrics of an Alan Jay Lerner song, \\"Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.\\" White, who had known the Kennedys from his time as a classmate of the late President's brother, Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., was happy to oblige. He heeded some of Jackie's suggestions while writing a 1,000 word essay that he dictated later that evening to his editors at Life. When they complained that the Camelot theme was overdone, Jackie objected to changes. By this telling, Kennedy's time in office was transformed into a modern-day Camelot that represented, \\"a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers, and poets met at the White House, and the barbarians beyond the walls held back.\\" White later described his comparison of JFK to Camelot as the result of kindness to a distraught widow of a just-assassinated leader, and wrote that his essay was a \\"misreading of history. The magic Camelot of John F. Kennedy never existed.\\"White, Theodore H. In Search of History: A Personal Adventure, p. 524. After Watergate and the fall of Richard Nixon, White broke his quadrennial pattern with Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon (1975), a dispassionate account of the scandal and its players. There was no 1976 volume from White; the closest analogue was Marathon by Jules Witcover. After a volume of memoirs, published in 1978, he returned to presidential coverage with the 1980 campaign, and America In Search of Itself: The Making of the President 1956‚Äì80 (1982), draws together original reporting and new social analysis of the previous quarter-century, focusing primarily but not exclusively on the Reagan-Carter contest. TIME partnered with White to publish the 400 page The Making of the President 1984, which was to be a collaborative effort amongst multiple writers. White was expected to write the opening and closing chapters, and the chapter covering the 1984 Democratic National Convention. The remaining chapters were to be written by other Time magazine writers, principally Hays Gorey, Time‚Äôs Washington correspondent. However, prior to the election, the partnership dissolved, as White was unhappy with the quality of work he was seeing from the Time reporters.Theodore White-Time Book Project Dissolves, NY Times, October 4, 1984 This final entry in the series was shortened and titled \\"The Shaping of the Presidency, 1984,\\" a lengthy post-election analysis piece in Time, in its special Ronald Reagan issue of November 19, 1984. Personal life, and death White's marriage to Nancy Bean ended in divorce.White, Theodore H. In Search of History: A Personal Adventure They had a son and a daughter. His second marriage was to Beatrice Kevitt Hofstadter, the widow of historian Richard Hofstadter. On May 15, 1986, nine days after his 71st birthday, White suffered a sudden stroke and died in New York City. He was survived by two of his children, Heyden White Rostow and David Fairbank White, and his wife, Beatrice Kevitt Hofstadter.Obituary of Beatrice Kevitt Hofstadter, New York Times, November 1, 2012.

White at large: the best of his magazine writing, 1939-1986, Theodore Harold White, ed. Edward T. Thompson, Pantheon Books, 1992, Assessments Both W. A. Swanberg in Luce and His Empire and David Halberstam in The Powers That Be discuss how White's China reporting for TIME was extensively rewritten, frequently by Whittaker Chambers, to conform to publisher Henry Luce's admiration for Chiang Kai-shek. Chambers himself explained post-factum: > The fight in Foreign News was not a fight for control of a seven-page > section of a newsmagazine. It was a struggle to decide whether a million > Americans more or less were going to be given the facts about Soviet > aggression, or whether those facts were going to be suppressed, distorted, > sugared or perverted into the exact opposite of their true meaning. In > retrospect, it can be seen that this critical struggle was, on a small > scale, an opening round of the Hiss Case. Conservative author William F. Buckley, Jr. wrote an obituary of White in the National Review in which he described that \\"conjoined with his fine mind, his artist's talent, his prodigious curiosity, there was a transcendent wholesomeness, a genuine affection for the best in humankind.\\" He praised White, saying he \\"revolutionized the art of political reporting.\\" Buckley added that White made one grave strategic mistake during his journalistic lifetime: \\"Like so many disgusted with Chiang Kai-shek, he imputed to the opposition to Chiang thaumaturgical social and political powers. He overrated the revolutionists' ideals, and underrated their capacity for totalitarian sadism.\\" In her book, Theodore H. White and Journalism As Illusion, Joyce Hoffman contends that White's \\"personal ideology undermined professional objectivity\\" (according to the review of her work in Library Journal). She alleges \\"conscious mythmaking\\" on behalf of his subjects, including Chiang Kai-shek, John F. Kennedy, and David Bruce. Hoffman alleges that White self- censored information embarrassing to his subjects to portray them as heroes. But White wrote: > There is the question of civil liberties and minority rights, which lie at > the root of America's concept of democracy. During the war the Communists > championed all that was good in Chinese life; they fought against Kuomintang > dictatorship and in so fighting fought for the liberties of all other > groups. But up to now the Communists have been in opposition to the dominant > regime, and their base has lain in the backward villages, where opposition > has been nonexistent. How will they react to the organized opposition of the > large cities where the Kuomintang middle class is firmly established and > where, with money and influence, it can command a press that will present an > alternative program? Will the Communists, if they govern large and complex > industrial cities, permit an opposition press and opposition party to > challenge them by a combination of patronage and ideology? They say that > they will, for they believe that in any honest contest for the vote of the > people, the people will vote them and their allies a majority against the > candidates of the landed and well-to-do minority. But if the Communists are > wrong in their calculations and are outvoted, will they yield to a peaceful > vote? Will they champion civil liberties as ardently as they do now? This is > a question that cannot be answered until we have had the opportunity of > seeing how a transitional coalition regime works in peace time practice. > Theodore White, Thunder Out of China, pp 236-237 Contemporary critics on the left have strongly criticized a 1967 made-for-TV documentary that White wrote called China: The Roots of Madness as a \\"callous and condescending\\" portrayal of Chinese. White's reporting was described as \\"self-important, sanctimonious and he gave voice to no more than an American viewpoint\\", wherein he portrayed the Chinese as merely pawns in the Cold War, blinkered by their Communist ideology. Film Threat remarked that White never attempted to take on board the Chinese viewpoint, and points out there were unconfirmed rumors that the CIA was involved in the film's making.\\"China: The Roots of Madness, 1967: Movies & TV\\", Amazon.com, Retrieved March 25, 2011\\"The Bootleg Files: China: The Roots Of Madness\\", Film Threat, June 11, 2010.

Fefferman (known as Dan Fefferman) is a church leader and activist for the freedom of religion. He is a member of the Unification Church of the United States, a branch of the international Unification Church, founded by Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954. Fefferman has held several leadership positions in church related organizations. In the 1970s he was a leader of the National Prayer and Fast Committee, Project Watergate, and the Freedom Leadership Foundation, which were involved in political activism. In 1977 he testified before the Fraser Committee. Fefferman was leader of the Unification Church in Illinois, regional director for the Unification Church for the Midwestern United States, the headquarters director of Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles (CARP) and editor of the national journal of the Unification Church. Since 1984 he has been the executive director of the Unification Church affiliated International Coalition for Religious Freedom, which was founded in the 1980s and has been active in protesting what it considers to be threats to religious freedom by governmental agencies. Early life and family Fefferman became a member of the Unification Church in 1968. After that he obtained degrees from the University of California at Berkeley and from the Unification Theological Seminary. Fefferman is married with two daughters, and lives in Washington, D.C. with his family. Unification Church work Political activism In 1974, Fefferman was the executive director of the National Prayer and Fast Committee, a group organized by Sun Myung Moon to support Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. According to one report Moon had chosen Fefferman (who is Jewish) to become the Prime Minister of Israel at some future time. Fefferman was an official with the Freedom Leadership Foundation, which was also founded by Moon, and deemed a \\"political arm\\" of the Unification Church. According to testimony provided by Fefferman to the United States Congress, at a scheduled September 1974 rally by the Freedom Leadership Foundation against the government of Japan, members debated cutting off their fingers as a form of raising dramatic effect, but instead decided on egg throwing. The rally was canceled prior to being carried out. Fefferman testified in August 1977 before the Fraser Committee, a subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives which investigated possible ties between Sun Myung Moon and the South Korean National Intelligence Service (\\"KCIA\\"). Testimony from Fefferman confirmed that he had social ties to officials within the South Korean embassy. Fefferman testified that he had arranged a meeting in 1975 between Republican aide Edwin Feulner of the Heritage Foundation and South Korean Minister Kim Yung Hwan, to potentially put together a group of congressional aides who would travel to South Korea. Hwan was then-station chief for the KCIA. During his testimony, Fefferman refused to answer nine questions from the subcommittee, saying that they violated his constitutional rights to freedom of religion and association. The subcommittee recommended that Fefferman be cited for contempt of Congress. Fefferman, speaking to The Michigan Daily in 1980, said the subcommittee's recommendations were never taken up, and no charges were pressed. Church leadership In 1977 Fefferman served as leader of the Unification Church in the state of Illinois, as well as regional church director for the Midwestern United States. In 1982, he was headquarters director and national president of Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles (CARP), a collegiate organization founded by Moon and church members in 1955.\\"In 1955, Reverend Moon established the Collegiate Association for the Research of the Principle (CARP). CARP is now active on many campuses in the United States and has expanded to over eighty nations. This association of students promotes intercultural, interracial, and international cooperation through the Unification world view.\\" A National Movement Emerges: 1972‚Äì74 ‚Äì A History Of The Unification Church In America 1959‚Äì74 ‚Äì Michael L Mickler It was described by The Washington Post as \\"the youth organization of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church\\", and by the ICSA as \\"the UC's youth arm\\". Fefferman was the editor of the national journal of the Unification Church in 1989, and served as chief editor of the first edition of Divine Principle in English, as well as other church publications. International Coalition for Religious Freedom Since 1984, Fefferman has been the executive director of the Unification Church affiliated organization the International Coalition for Religious Freedom in Virginia, which is active in protesting what it considers to be threats to religious freedom by governmental agencies. In 1999 the International Coalition for Religious Freedom filed a lawsuit in United States district court in Baltimore, Maryland, against a Maryland state task force which was investigating new religious movements on state college campuses. Fefferman commented to The Boston Globe about the case, \\"The United States has correctly criticized European states for scrutinizing smaller and newer religions through government commissions such as this one. The state of Maryland has been manipulated into engaging in religious McCarthyism by carrying out a biased inquisition into new religious minorities as 'cults.'\\" In 1999 Fefferman defended the rights of Wiccan soldiers in the United States military to practice their faith.Spellbound, Sacramento Bee, August 12, 1999 In 2000, Fefferman wrote to his colleagues about the Million Family March, planned to be held in Washington, D.C., and sponsored by Moon and Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, acknowledging that the two leaders' views differed on multiple issues but shared a view of a \\"God- centered family\\". In 2001 Bill Gertz, author and an investigative reporter for The Washington Times, which was owned by the Unification Church, cited Fefferman as a person who \\"contributed valuable inspiration, advice, help, and support\\" to Gertz's book Betrayal. In 2004 Fefferman said that religious persecution of Muslims is probably under reported due to the fact that many victims are refugees, in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. Fefferman gave a presentation on the Unification Church at a conference of the International Cultic Studies Association in 2004. In 2008 he gave a presentation on the Unification Church at the London School of Economics at a conference sponsored by the organizations INFORM and CESNUR. In 2009 he criticized the government of Kazakhstan for its treatment of religious minorities, including members of the Unification Church.

Though beaten by Zenyatta. Background Life Is Sweet was bred by her owners, Pam & Martin Wygod. By leading sire Storm Cat, she is out of the Kris S. mare Sweet Life, who is also the dam of champion juvenile filly Sweet Catomine. Sweet Life would be named the 2009 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Life Is Sweet originally raced on the east coast with Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott, but at age four was transferred to the California-based barn of John Shirreffs, best known as the trainer of Zenyatta. Racing career Life Is Sweet made her debut as a two-year-old at Saratoga on August 30, 2007, finishing eighth. On October 7, she made her second start, this time at Belmont on the turf, and won by a commanding nine lengths. She was next entered in the Epitome Breeders' Cup Stakes on October 27 but finished sixth. Life Is Sweet did not run again until an allowance race at Gulfstream Park on February 22, 2008, which she won. On April 5, she faced Grade 1 company for the first time in the Ashland Stakes, finishing fourth. She then ran second in both the Calder Oaks on April 26 and Sand Point Stakes on May 31. Life Is Sweet did not return to racing until January 18, 2009 in the El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita. Now trained by Shirreffs, she settled behind horses for the first miles, then swung four wide around the turn to get running room. In the stretch, she pulled to the lead and won by lengths. Her next start was the La Canada Stakes on February 15, for which she was made the 6-5 favorite. She once again settled near the back of the field until swinging wide on the final turn, finally gaining the lead near the finish line to win by lengths. Although the opening fractions were quite slow, Life Is Sweet ran the last eighth of a mile in a very quick 11.20 seconds. Jockey Garrett Gomez said, \\"She really showed a great turn of foot and to be able to overcome that slow pace like she did is amazing. You can see her stride gets longer as she gets closer to the wire.\\" On March 14, she faced her biggest test yet in the Grade 1 Santa Margarita Invitational, where she was the even money favorite. The race was nearly a carbon copy of her two previous wins, with Life Is Sweet starting her winning move around the far turn to eventually win by lengths. Life Is Sweet's next start was the Milady Handicap on May 23, in which her stablemate Zenyatta was making her season debut. The two raced in fifth and sixth down the backstretch and started their moves around the far turn. Zenyatta outkicked Life Is Sweet to win by lengths, with Life Is Sweet in second. Life is Sweet then faced off with males in the Hollywood Gold Cup on July 11. In a large field of 13, she was trapped behind horses until they entered the stretch, where she closed from 11th to 3rd. She then finished fourth behind Zenyatta in both the Clement L. Hirsch on August 9 and the Lady's Secret on October 10. A slow pace in both races compromised her attempt to come from behind in the stretch. On November 6, 2009, Life Is Sweet came into her own with a runaway win in the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic. She broke poorly and got pinched by other horses, but soon settled near the back of the pack. On the far turn, she circled wide of the field and drew off to a convincing win. \\"I‚Äôm just so happy for Life is Sweet,\\" said Shirreffs. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs such a nice filly. She ran so great early in the year. I was glad she was able to get it done today. She really deserves this.\\" Life is Sweet finished second to Zenyatta in the Eclipse Award voting for champion older mare of 2009. Life Is Sweet's last race was on February 13, 2010, when she finished second in the Santa Maria Handicap. On March 13, she was preparing for a run in the Dubai World Cup; however, after the workout, she suffered muscle cramps and owner Marty Wygod decided to retire her. Wygod said, \\"If she can't run at her best, I don't want to. [Shirreffs] got her right for the Breeders' Cup. She was compromised in most of her races because of her tying up. We don't want to take a risk with her.\\" Retirement She was bred to Smart Strike and foaled a colt in March 2011. The colt, later named Disintermediate, was euthanized after fracturing a pastern during a workout at Golden Gate in December 2013. She also has a 2012 Bernardini filly named Sweet Promises and a 2013 filly named Lady Pamela by Tapit.

He married an Englishwoman, Constantia Draper; and the couple had four children. Constance Beerbohm's brother was the renowned actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree; another brother was the engineer, author and explorer Julius Beerbohm; a younger half-brother was the caricaturist and parodist Max Beerbohm. Constance was the only female member of Julius Beerbohm's first family. She was described as plain, unselfish and very tender-hearted. Eliza Beerbohm, who was her stepmother as well as her aunt, made it quite clear that she preferred her own daughters; and, to Constance's dismay when she had grown up, she had to leave the family home and set up on her own. One afternoon, she called on her family, hiding a parcel containing her belongings in the bushes in the drive. Staying until nearly supper-time, her stepmother said, \\"You had better stay to supper\\". After supper, Constance lingered until nearly bedtime: \\"You had better stay the night\\", said her stepmother. Constance fetched her parcel from the bushes and stayed for the rest of her life, taking on the practical management of the household and helping to bring up her five younger half-siblings, including Max Beerbohm.

The model is aimed at helping pupils acquire social competences. According to this model, the school social worker gets and keeps in touch both with the child, the family and the school. Within the P√©cs model the school social worker is employed by an NGO independent from the school. The NGO builds and co-ordinates a network of the school social workers and supervises their work. The school social workers work full-time in their schools. Most of their work time is spent there; except when they visit families, do case management work, or partake in team discussions. They have their own office in the school, which makes them known as a member and supporter of the school community (Felvinczi 2007:38). History An important stage in the development of the P√©cs model was when the prevention team of INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny got acquainted with school social work services already functioning well in the city of P√©cs and in county Baranya. In 2003, a school social worker and a child protection professional joined the prevention team. Soon afterward, a need for the application of school social work was suggested at several professional forums, such as the Conciliatory Forum on Drug Policies, the Child Protection Workshop and the Roundtable on Social Policy. A study carried out in 2004 by Tihanyi and Gerg√°l on child protection work done at schools and on the prospects of social work at local schools also played an important role in the formation of the program. The study pointed out that 60 percent of teachers involved in the research would consider the presence of a social professional at school as necessary. Moreover, 74 percent would consult such a professional on a weekly basis. The research study also found that 50 percent of child protection workers would welcome professionals with a degree and work experience in social work to take the job over from them (Tihanyi 2004:53). INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny took the initiative in spreading school social work in Hungary. The program was launched in academic year 2006 / 2007 in three secondary schools in P√©cs. In academic year 2008 / 2009, three further schools (an eight-class grammar school, a primary school and a vocational school) joined the project. Thus, the Network of School Social Workers of INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny employs full-time school social workers in six schools at present. INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny maintains an integrated therapeutic system, which comprises several institutions (a drug abuse prevention and training center, two outpatient and a residential drug abuse treatment centres, day clinics, halfway houses), low threshold community services and outreach programs (T√âR Community Service, street social work services, ALTERNATIVE Youth Office, Party Service). Associated teams and NGOs (Drug Abuse Prevention Team Association, Network of School Social Workers, M√©rf√∂ldk≈ë Association) also contribute to the integrated system. INDIT K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny applies a complex approach to the treatment of addictions. Ensures easy access to services designed to meet individual needs. The K√∂zalap√≠tv√°ny also focuses on prevention and attitude formation of communities. Integrated therapeutic systems of the above nature are able to give the most adequate answers to the clients' problems due to their vertically and horizontally interconnected and coherent structure of services. Outreach and prevention programs are more effective, street social workers are more confident than they would be without the background treatment facilities. Risk of a client's dropping out of treatment is reduced significantly. The system is undergoing a permanent development as problems associated with addictions change. Effective solutions can only be provided by a team with a reliable professional background and an open and creative spirit (Szemely√°cz 2005). The non-governmental status also makes it possible for the organization to deliver services quickly and in an innovative and flexible manner. Organizational structure of the therapeutic system is a so-called \\"provision pyramid\\", which ensures the cost effectiveness of continuous therapeutic interventions and caretaking. School social work The first school social work programs were launched in Hungary in the early 1990s. \\"School social work is an activity that helps schoolchildren develop their skills and reach their full potential through the improvement of their social relations and their integration into community\\" (B√°nyai 2000). School social work is planned to prevent children from becoming endangered and to contribute to their being brought up in their own families. School social work handles problems arising in various systems (families, groups of children, communities) in a complex way by the help of social work techniques. It is primarily preventive in nature. School social work empowers pupils; it gives them ways to get to know themselves and to become able to resolve social problems of their own and those occurring in their environment (MGYSZOE 2005). Network of School Social Workers The World Health Organization considers health as not merely the lack of illness, but as a balanced state of physical, mental and social well-being (Ajkai, 1996). Thus, traditional interpretation of prevention is being revised. Drug use related health promotion for example might be aimed at reducing risk factors leading to drug consumption. The most important protective factors are the following: self-esteem, the feeling of responsibility, and the belief that one is able to accomplish one's dreams and to have one's way. These may result from academic success, firm social support, or from the positive outcomes of life transitions (R√°cz 2001: 57-62). The network programme is designed to strengthen the protective factors mentioned. We need the potent supportive presence of professionals. Multidisciplinarity is an essential element of social work. The notion of an educating school is gradually changing (Buda 2000, Gyenge 2000). Much more knowledge is to be imparted nowadays than was earlier. Academic requirements for pupils have been increasing, schools themselves have become stressors and potential risk factors. Besides the altering relationship between schools and society, due to individualization the role of peers in socialization has been increasing and peer groups has partly been taking the place of the family. Schools remained the only settings where factors influencing children can be controlled (Buda 2000:17). The programme uses the school social work models developed in the United States in the late 1960s, first described by Alderson: * Basic assumption of the traditional clinical model is that the child has problems due to the dysfunctions of the family. In the clinical model, school social workers work with students and family members applying primarily casework methods supplemented by group methods. The model is aimed at the development of a supportive cooperation. This deals less with the school. * The school change model is aimed at identifying and changing dysfunctional norms and conditions of the school. * Community school model: targets disadvantaged communities, which, in their opinion, misunderstand and distrust school. * Social interaction model: focuses mainly on the interaction between the behavior of individuals and groups. Interventions are aimed to affect the quality and type of the interactions. The above models underwent further development in Germany in the 1980s. Child-oriented school social work applies a preventive approach to find solutions to children's problems. School social work acts as an autonomous institution. Social workers keep in close touch with families and pay frequent visits to them. The above approach together with the ecological model worked up in the mid 1990s by Florance Costin influenced the P√©cs model. The model is intended to help pupils acquire social competences and to sensitize schools to the needs of children. The social worker is in contact both with the child, the family and the school, focuses on the whole, and considers the complexity of the personality and the environment at the same time. She / he basically concentrates on health. She / he endeavours to find and make use of resources in order to surmount environmental constraints (Costin, quoted by Balik√≥ 2000). Construction of a positive lifestyle can be facilitated through weakening risk factors and strengthening protective factors. In Hungary, protective factors can hardly compensate for risk factors affecting young people. The P√©cs model employs school social workers in state-owned schools in the city of P√©cs. Modern ecological approach integrates the theory of protective and risk factors and studies on resilience carried out in the last two decades. Resilience refers to successful adaptation, an ability to exploit positive features of the environment, and the positive ways people respond to stress (Wang, Haertel, & Walberg, 1999, quoted by Gleason-Erin T 2007). Resilience refers to individual, familial, and environmental characteristics that modify risk and allow children to thrive despite at-risk circumstances (Fergus & Zimmerman, 2005; quoted by Gleason-Erin T 2007). Educational resilience theory recognizes that overlapping ecological contexts of family, school, peer, and community are interdependent and that they all affect learning (Fraser;Wang et al. quoted by Gleason-Erin T 2007). Services Individual counselling and case management * counselling for pupils experiencing hardships at school or undergoing difficult life events * counselling for pupils in conflict with teachers or vice versa * career advising * acting for pupils at official procedures, assistance in the resolution of social problems, advising on application for grants * enabling parents to handle their child's academic failure or behavioral problems at school, improving parenting skills * referring pupils and parents to specialized services (specialized advisory offices, youth bureaus, child protection services, employment agencies, drug abuse treatment centres etc.) *mediation between parents and children Services provided for parents and families * Counselling and life management coaching for families * Attendance at teacher-parent meetings Social group work * Social group work for pupils with specific needs and for heterogeneous groups * Building good relations among classmates via group techniques * Seminars for pupils on different topics * Career orientation groups Community social work * Co-operation with pupils' governments * Co-operation with youth-assistance groups in certain districts of town * Co- operation with parent-teacher associations * Introducing and organizing community events (film clubs, tea-rooms) for pupils * Planning and organizing free-time activities and programmes strengthening social solidarity * Participation in school excursions and trips, contribution to days of education * Organizing further education for teachers Target groups of the school social work programme are schoolchildren, their families and anyone connected to pupils in some way. Within the P√©cs model professionals apply the following techniques of social work: individual case management (counselling, advising); group work (education of group members, improving their social relations, prevention), and community social work. Summary * The employer is a civil organization independent from the school and the child welfare system (independence). Benefits: the professional work is not affected by the hierarchical circumstances. * The school social workers work in a network providing professional control and support (case discussions, uniform administration, work diary, circulation report, social forms, individual problem solving designs). To ensure effective work in the schools, they hold weekly case discussions, whose aim is professional support; in addition, there are so-called expanded or open case discussions every month (network). * The school social workers work full-time in their school, most of their work time is spent there; the exceptions are when they visit families, hold case managements, or partake in team discussions. They have their own office in the school (with computer and direct telephone). This makes them easily available to students; an adult who helps them and gives them emotional support (availability). * According to the global approach, it is possible that different methods of work are given priority in the different schools (e.g. practicing secondary school ‚Äì group work, polytechnic school ‚Äì teamwork, trade school ‚Äì individual case treatment) (flexibility). * The model develops close cooperation with other youth helping programs in non-school settings, in fact many of these programs work within the INDIT Foundation: Alternat√≠va Ifj√∫s√°gi Iroda (Alternative Youth Office ‚Äì the first so-called Plaza program in Hungary), Street Social Service, BuliSeg√©ly (harm reduction for drug users in party settings). The integrated functioning of these many different programs makes it possible for the system to reach dropouts and other youth unreachable from the school (cooperation). * Individual professional consultation in every school at least once a month, whose aim is the \\"tailor-made\\" professional support of the social workers (consultation). * The social workers try to function as a part of a health promoting work team (school nurse, school doctor, school psychologist, program organizer, person responsible for youth protection, homeroom teacher, etc.) and also try to promote these kinds of teams (team). * During the program, an important part is given to the measuring of effectiveness (administration, publicity) (effectiveness). * Program framework: derived from the child-orientated school social work and the modern ecology models. The school social worker tries to find a solution for the child's problem in a preventive way, through his own methods ‚Äì individual case treatment, social group work, community work. The school social work is a separate institution acting in an autonomous way, it is not subordinate to the school management, it is financed by an independent employer and is supported by supervision teams and case discussions. It is in connection with the child, the family and the school, concentrates on the whole, and takes into account the complexity of the environment and personality. During his work, the social worker concentrates on the strengths of his clients, tries to strengthen the protective factors, but knows about the complexity of the problems and the variety of professions possible in their treatment. The solution in searched for with the help of a multidisciplinary team (scientificity). See also * Education in Hungary * School social work in Hungary References * Ajkai Z (1996).

William Benjamin Euba, who desired to establish an African Institution that would provide educational opportunities for the less privilege citizens of Lagos. History Rev. William Benjamin Euba, a teacher and master of religion at the Methodist Boys High School, Lagos was the principal of Methodist Boys High School for seventeen years before establishing Eko Boys High School. The school started with 28 students at 30 Broad Street, Lagos, next building to St. George‚Äôs Hall, Lagos, opposite the Methodist Boys High School. After a few months, the number of students have increased so considerably that the premises could not accommodate them. A new premises had to be sought for. Rev. Euba succeeded in obtaining a new premises at Oil Mill street Lagos, the school moved to the new site the same year on October 14, 1913. This new site was to be occupied by the buildings of Baptist Academy. Among the students then were late Magistrate Adebiyi Desalu and Francis Euba, Orlando Martins, E.A Ewedemi, A.B. Soares, J.S Mc Gregor and Lawson of Salvation Army. In another 10 years the school was progressing both in the fields of education, sports and religion. When the lease of the property expired in June 1924, the landlord was not willing to renew it, and the principal was faced with the problem of where to relocate the school. With friends and some important people gathering heads together, knowing the school cannot be run on commercial basis, some estate agents were approached but no encouraging results were forthcoming. But when the principal was on the verge of total frustration, he saw the beckoning hands of Late Joseph Henryson Doherty, ace merchant of Alakoro who offered to the principal a plot of land at the junction of Andrew and Ricca streets in okepopo, Lagos. The principal quickly put up a temporary building of corrugated iron sheets to house the students. on the morning of July 21, 1924 the school moved from Oil Mills street to Ricca Street. In appreciation of the kindness and the financial help, the school therefore named one of the school houses Henryson House. The founder Rev. Euba retired shortly after the registration of teachers started on the occasion of his birthday celebration on August 23, 1927, when he was 70 years old. He announced at the close of the occasion organized by the school, his retirement from all the activities of the school and handed over all the future management in the hands of Mr. Obadiah Edwards Roberts who he had much pleasure in appointing the principal of the school. The education officer, in his special report which was made after the school had moved to Ricca on 10 August 1928 said ‚ÄúThe school is held in two rugged constructed corrugated iron building. Screens are provided between all classrooms and there is a general atmosphere of intelligent organization which is seldom found in non-assisted schools‚Äù On October 8, 1931 the founder practically handed over to Mr. O.E Roberts absolutely the proprietorship of the school in a declaration that run thus ‚ÄúI William Benjamin Euba, founder and proprietor of Eko Boys High School, Lagos hereby decide to assign all and singular my interest in the said school to my assistant Mr. Obadiah Edward Roberts the present principal of the school, absolutely in consideration of his services to the school and pecuniary expenses incurred by him on behalf of the school and otherwise to the intent that henceforth the said Obadiah Edward Roberts shall enjoy the whole and full benefits and advantage of the said school and the future profits thereof as fully as I have done hitherto. And Mr. O.E. Roberts shall use his best endeavour to maintain as he has done in the past the reputation of the said school‚Äù Witnessed my hand this 8 October 1931. Signed W.B. Euba. With this declaration the mantle of Elijah with his heavy weight fell on O.E. Roberts who was now faced with problems which confronted Rev. Euba in June 1924. Eight years after the school had moved from Oil Mill street, the number of students had increased to the extent that the two small halls at Ricca could not contain them. it was obvious a more spacious building must be secured to match with progress. On October 25, 1932 the school again moved from Ricca Street to 2 Ajele Street Lagos. On November 29, 1933, the founder and proprietor of the school Rev. Euba died peacefully in his farm house at Agbado Station. In December 1933, the Government approved the school for middle form standard and started to award middle four certificates. During World War Two, it was difficult for the principal to have stable staff because the cost of living had risen and salaries of teachers had increased in the government aided and assisted schools. Since the school was already in arrears, loyal members of the staff advised the principal to make efforts to secure government assistance if the standard and efficiency in the school were to be maintained and more so, the existence of the school. In September 1947, the legislative Council decided and put EBHS on their assisted schools and so the Board of Governors was formed with Mr. O.E Roberts as chairman, A.R. George, A.A. Oseni, Sir Kofo Abayomi, Chief H.S.A. Thomas, A.B. Thomas, Chief Dr. Akinola Maja and Magistrate A. Desalu, the secretary was Mr. A. Thompson. The Trustees of the Board were registered under the land Perpetual Succession Ordinance. As the years rolled by, the hardship encountered by way of progress became more serious. The school must have a permanent place. All efforts to acquire buildings in the Lagos Island or Ebute Metta in the Mainland of Lagos failed for lack of fund. But out of self less devotion to the school, the chairman of the Board of Trustees, Mr. Obadiah Edwards Roberts offered free his landed property at Moshawele, Mushin Lagos. The offer was accepted and the school building plan was developed in ‚ÄúE‚Äù shape to represent first letter of the name of the founder ‚ÄôEUBA‚Äô. On May 7, 1948, the turning of the first sod took place on Nov. 27th after a brief religious ceremony performed by Arch. Of Lagos the Late Dr. J.O. Lucas; the foundation stone was laid by Sir Olumuyiwa Jibowu. By December 1949, the main building has been completed. Financial assistance in building the school was also received from Dr Akinola Maja. The school was opened with 300 pupils on the roll. As from the time the Board of Governors was formed, the board did not only embark on construction of buildings to accommodate the students but also took steps to train teachers at higher institutions for staffing of the school. In 1951, a two storey building was erected. The ground floor was used as staffroom and bursars office. The first floor for school library, and in 1954/1955 two arms of the main school building were raised to the first floor to provide for one more science laboratory and an assembly Hall. Two storey building in the zone were purchased in 1955/56 and were used as staff quarters. The area declared by Ikeja Town Planning Authority as Eko boys‚Äô High School zone is about eight (8) acres, out of this 1.3 Acres represent the gift from the late Obadiah Edwards Roberts to the school and the Board had to negotiate with different plot owners in the zone. Up to December 1961, the Board has spent over ¬£11,000 then in acquiring plots of land within the zone. The school is now on his way to Abijo in Lekki, Lagos Island, following the near total dilapidation of infrastructure at the Mushin campus. The foundation for the New site for the school was laid on 10 January 2013 by Gov. Fashola. With the present commitment, it is hope that the dreams of building a befitting structure for school will be realised.

Outbreak of rebellion Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din was a descendant of the founder of the Zaidi state in Yemen, Imam al-Mansur al-Qasim (d. 1620).The filiation was: al-Qasim al-Mansur ‚Äì al-Husayn ‚Äì Muhammad ‚Äì Isma'il ‚Äì Muhammad ‚Äì Yahya ‚Äì Muhammad ‚Äì Yahya Hamid ad-Din ‚Äì Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din. As a middle- aged scholar, he experienced the Ottoman occupation of highland Yemen in 1872. In 1876, Muhammad and other religious leaders of San'a were arrested by the Turks due to a dispute with the Ottoman authorities. They were brought to Hudaydah where they were kept under surveillance for two years. Muhammad survived the exile and returned to San'a.Yehuda Nini, The Jews of the Yemen 1800‚Äì1914. Harwood 1991, p. 15. Meanwhile, Zaidi resistance was kept alive by local groups including the followers of imams al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin (d. 1878) and al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din (d. 1890). These were unable to threaten Turkish rule in San'a and the coastland, although large parts of the highlands could not be controlled by Ottoman administration. After the death of al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din, the Zaidi ulema agreed to choose his brother-in-law Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din, for lack of more suitable candidates. On being summoned, Muhammad left San'a for Sa'dah further to the north, where resistance was based. His full title as imam was al-Mansur billah Ahmad ad-Din Muhammad. This occurred in July 1890 (or, in another version, May 1891). Muhammad had access to the treasury of his predecessor, which facilitated his leadership. He allotted stipends of grain and money to the ulema, and circulated letters among the tribesmen. He was able to stir up most of the northern tribes against the Turkish officials and troops.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 92. A number of towns and forts around San'a, such as Hajjah, Yarim and Dhamar, were captured by the imam's followers. In 1892 San'a itself was besieged for a while by rebel troops. The initial successes of Muhammad's followers decreased the prestige of the Turks, already unpopular through extortions and maladministration.Caesar E. Farah, pp. 158‚Äì62. Religious basis of resistance Although the Turks were able to prevail, they were never able to regain the military initiative. Reinforcements of troops could not stop the expansion of Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din's sphere of influence. The hit- and-run tactics of the tribesmen wore out the Ottoman militaries. Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent messages to Muhammad in 1891 and 1896, asking him to submit and accept a stipend and an Ottoman rank. Muhammad flatly declined the offers. He replied that his aim was not political power for its own sake, but rather the implementation of the shariah law, protection of the people from rapacious officials, and the prohibition of wine consumption and prostitution. The Turkish officials were alleged to act against Islamic precepts. In other words, Muhammad was able to frame his resistance in the professed protection of religion, against the secular and Western-influenced Turks.J.M. Willis, 'Leaving Only Question-Marks; Geographies of Rule in Modern Yemen', in M. Al- Rasheed & R. Vitalis (eds), Counter-Narratives; Contemporary Security, and Politics in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. New York 2004, p. 128. Imamic resistance continued with new outbreaks of fighting in 1898. In the following year the imam asked the Sultan of Lahej in South Yemen to ask the British in Aden for protection. This did not lead to any results.Caesar E. Farah, pp. 174, 178, 188. Although his authority was not uncontested, Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad- Din was generally able to revive the glories of the early Qasimid imams. He put an end to customary laws in most of the northern tribal areas, organized stipends for men of religion, and alms for widows, orphans and teachers.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, p. 94. He died in 1904, leaving a son, Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, who was accepted as his successor as imam. Yahya would eventually drive the Turks out of Yemen in 1918.

Plot  David Shelby (Rock Hudson) is the wealthy owner of a new ski resort nestled below a snow-covered mountain. He invites his ex-wife, Caroline Brace (Mia Farrow), to come to the resort for the grand opening, which also kicks off a ski tournament and a figure skating competition. Among the many guests is David's feisty mother, Florence (Jeanette Nolan), Bruce Scott (Rick Moses) a world famous ski champion, and two rival figure skaters. Caroline, a magazine reporter, divorced David as he is a control freak, but David invited her to the resort in an attempt to rekindle their marriage. David has to be \\"King of the Mountain\\", and opened the resort in what was considered uninhabitable country due to the heavy avalanches. McDade (Steve Franken) the timid book keeper, explains to Florence that David had to negotiate with land developers and put his own money into building the resort. While taking her on a tour of the grounds, McDade runs into Nick Thorne (Robert Forster), an environmental photographer who claims the resort is environmentally unsafe due to the heavy snowfall scheduled to arrive, but his protests are ignored. Caroline finds herself becoming attracted to Nick, which only infuriates David and brings out his controlling side. Due to considerable red tape involved in the construction of the resort, David urges one of his business partners to fly in to settle matters despite the snow. He hosts a large party in the resort the night of the opening, where everyone dances and drinks the night away. Caroline, after confronting David over his controlling nature, runs into Nick and they go off together to Nick's cabin. As the night goes on the snowfall increases, adding more weight to the mountain. The next morning sees the start of the ski and figure skating events, and Nick leaves Caroline in the cabin to go shoot some of the fresh snow off of the mountain with a snow gun to avoid an avalanche. Unfortunately, the plane carrying David's business partner crashes into the mountain due to low visibility, starting an avalanche. Tons of snow roll down the mountain, destroying the ski ramp, the skating rink and the resort, resulting in an immense loss of life. David gets trapped at the skating rink but manages to dig himself out. He makes it to the resort, where McDade and Florence are trapped under a staircase in the dining room. A gas leak in the kitchen causes an explosion, injuring more people and taking out the phone lines. The nearest town's fire department comes to the rescue, bringing along a camera crew to document the destruction. Bruce manages to ski away from the impending avalanche, but is buried alive. The ski ramp is destroyed and everyone is buried except for a boy named Jason and Mark Elliott (Barry Primus), a television host. The two are stuck in a partly collapsed ski ramp chair, dangling in the air. Caroline sees the avalanche from the cabin and heads to the resort, meeting up with David. After dynamiting and digging through the snow, they come across McDade and Florence, who is near death due to hypothermia. Caroline resuscitates her through mouth to mouth and accompanies her on the ride to the hospital. Bruce, still alive, is found by a team of search and rescue people and is carried off in critical condition. David and a group from the fire department go to the ski ramp to rescue Jason and Mark, telling them to fall into the safety trampoline. Jason goes first and is safe, but the metal rope drags across the pulley and causes an electrical shock, electrocuting Mark. As David and Nick load body bags into a truck another ambulance arrives, the driver telling David that the bridge leading to the hospital is still unsafe due to the snow. Realizing that Caroline and Florence are heading that way, Nick and David drive off to intercept them. The ambulance carrying the women skids over a patch of ice and careens off the road, causing Caroline to be thrown out. The vehicle crashes into a gorge under the bridge and explodes on the way down, killing the driver and Florence. David and Nick make it to the scene minutes later to find Caroline clinging to the bridge's collapsed railing, hanging over the ledge. The men work together to pull Caroline up, David tying a rope around her and Nick pulling her to safety. The three then look on as the ambulance continues to burn under them. The scene cuts to Caroline arriving at the destroyed resort to say goodbye to David before leaving. She runs into Nick, who is leaving as well; he says it will take years to reclaim everything buried in the snow. Nick tells her he likes her just the way she is, and they part on good terms. Caroline goes inside the resort and has a final word with David, who admits that the entire incident is his fault, surprising Caroline. She tells him that she loves him and then departs, leaving David alone with the destruction of his accomplishments.

It was directed by Corey Allen, who had previously made the film Thunder and Lightning for Corman. Allen himself rewrote Gavin Lambert's script extensively and received a script credit. (Lambert later claimed Allen \\"dewrote\\" the script.) However, Allen was unhappy with the budget cuts and stated that \\"I don't feel the aims of the film were fulfilled‚Ä¶ there were heavy pressures on Paul [Rapp, the line producer,] to bring the film in ahead of schedule, and these I feel were detrimental to the film.\\" The film was shot at the Purgatory Resort north of Durango, Colorado over an eight-week period.  Reception  Avalanche was one of the most expensive films ever made by New World Pictures and was not a success at the box office. The film came out at the same time as New World's Piranha. Corman says that New World thought Avalanche would be more of a success because \\"it was more mainstream\\" and had bigger stars however Piranha was the bigger hit. In hindsight, Corman says this was because Piranha was \\"funny and very well directed\\". Legacy The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

J., 'Dods, Robert Smith (Robin) (1868‚Äì1920)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, , accessed 7 August 2012. Personal life Dods was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 9 June 1868. His parents were Robert Smith Dods (a wholesale grocer) and Elizabeth Gray, n√©e Stodart. His parents both came from Edinburgh, Scotland. However, the family did not stay long in New Zealand and returned to Edinburgh in the early 1870s, where his father died in 1876. His mother Elizabeth then immigrated to Brisbane. On the voyage she met Charles Ferdinard Marks, a physician, whom she married in Brisbane in 1879. Dods was educated at Brisbane Grammar School. He died at Edgecliff, Sydney on 23 July 1920. He was the brother of solicitor Stodart Dods and Queensland Medical Officer Espie Dods. He was the father of eminent physician Lorimer Dods.Yu, John, \\"Dods, Sir Lorimer Fenton (1900‚Äì1981)\\",Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 7 August 2012. He had three half-brothers and a half-sister from his mother's second marriage to Dr Charles Marks. They included Alexander Marks and Edward Marks. Career Robin Dods worked for the following architectural firms: * Hay & Henderson (Edinburgh) * Sir Aston Webb (London) * Hall & Dods (Brisbane) * Spain, Cosh & Dods (Sydney) Dods' period of activity in Brisbane between 1896 and 1916 place him firmly within what is now known as the Federation period. His work however has its origins clearly in the Arts and Crafts movement which swept Britain from the 1870s. Its influence was felt there right up until the beginning of World War I. Robin Dods was a gifted and capable designer, and was well connected. His surgeon stepfather, Dr Charles Ferdinand Marks, and his uncle, James Stodart, were both members of the Queensland Parliament, in its Upper and Lower houses respectively. Like them, he was admitted into the Protestant power base of the Queensland Club. This was a great asset in building a successful career. Dods was also a founding member of the Brisbane Golf Club and designed its first and second club houses. Hall & Dods were architects in Queensland for several national enterprises including the AMP Society, the Bank of New South Wales, the New Zealand Insurance Co, JC Hutton & Co, the Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Company, the Engineering Supply Company of Australia as well as several local department stores. For such clients there was the likelihood of repeat commissions, many of which eventuated. Within the original firm John Hall began in 1864, and the next incarnation, there was an established client base, although many new clients were secured by Dods. Through Dods‚Äô links with the medical profession, Hall & Dods became architects for both of the major hospitals in Brisbane at the time. For the Brisbane General Hospital, where Dods‚Äô stepfather was visiting surgeon and his uncle was chairman of the Hospital Board, Hall & Dods were commissioned for some 10 projects. The Sisters of Mercy also employed Hall & Dods to design a new hospital at South Brisbane ‚Äî the Mater Misericordiae Hospital. From 1908 the first four buildings were designed and built under the firm's supervision. An ambitious chapel for the sisters was also designed but not built. Dods designed most of the projects emanating from the partnership. These included a number of modern and distinctive houses in timber for a handful of doctors and other professional clients (often also his friends), several graziers, as well as private residences for his commercial clients. It was through the design of these houses that his reputation largely survives.http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/190179/Dods_brochure.pdf Dods visited the Continent in 1891 for a study tour of Italy. It was in Naples that he met Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who was also travelling to fulfil the terms of the Alexander Thomson Scholarship which he had won the previous year. Macintosh was destined to be recognised as one of the pioneers of the Modern Movement, and this meeting could have influenced Dods' architectural outlook. Robin Dods died on 23 July 1920, and was buried in the South Head Cemetery. At the age of 52, a busy and useful life was thus cut short, and a distinguished architect passed on, to leave in Queensland a legacy of outstanding achievement in the development of its architecture.Robin S. Dods The Life and Work of a Distinguished Queensland Architect by Neville H. Lund Practice in Sydney Although he had been so busy and successful in Brisbane, Dods felt that his architectural future in this city was limited. His ambition made him anxious to break into the larger commercial work offering in the south. In 1913 he terminated his partnership with Francis Hall and went to Sydney to join the firm of Spain and Cosh. Little is now known of Dods' architectural activity in Sydney. He built for himself a house at Edgecliff, described by a contemporary as \\"charming in its quiet Georgian character, well planned, and forming an attractive setting for the antique furniture he had collected for many years.\\" The Newcastle Club, from the offices of Spain and Cosh, is certainly Dods' work, as it exhibits many features characteristic of his Queensland domestic architecture. The largest known work in Sydney that was substantially of Dods' design was the South British Insurance Coy. Ltd. building, at the corner of O'Connell and Hunter Streets. Domestic work \\"A modern house is like matrimony in this, that it is most frequently assailed by those who have failed to attain it for themselves.\\" Robin Dods achieved early recognition of his domestic work. His houses, when built, were soon noticed and admired. His clients were evidently people with means, since a great bulk of his Brisbane houses were in the wealthy suburbs of Clayfield and New Farm. There is also a Dods house in Charleville and another in Reynella, South Australia. In two known cases only did he design cottage-type houses. These were two groups of three, and evidently designed for clients who were investing in real estate. Designing to suit the climate was a primary consideration with him. Planning suited the prevailing north-east breeze, and a generous area of wide verandah shaded the living and bedroom areas of his houses. His belief that an insulating layer of air over the house was essential gave rise to the characteristic high-pitched roof ventilated by gablets and neat lanterns. Commercial work As with his domestic work, Dods' commercial architecture is easily recognised. Again wherever possible he attempted to design for the climate, and his best work shows spacious planning and good ventilation. Soaring real estate values have made much of his planning now seem wasteful, but in any evaluation of his work it must be remembered that he worked in a comparatively small city whose commercial expansion has exceeded even the dreams of the then most visionary businessmen. Even in Brisbane, commercial buildings have a transitory life, so that of the many buildings designed by the architect a number of them have been demolished, added to, or altered out of all recognition. By and large, Dods' commercial work was not inspiring, but several of his buildings were significant, advanced for their time, and well worthy of further study.Robin Dods/Dods lecture s00855804_1968_1969_8_4_649.pdf Works His architectural works include:Robin Dods: Selected Works, accessed 7 August 2012 * 4BC House 30-38 Wharf St, Brisbane City, Queensland (destroyed) * Albury Civic Fire Station, 565 Kiewa Street, Albury, New South Wales * All Hallows Convent and School, 547 Ann Street, Fortitude Valley, Queensland * All Saints Memorial Church, Tamrookum Church Road, Tamrookum, Queensland * Australian Mercantile Land & Finance Woolstores, 34 Vernon Terrace, Teneriffe, Queensland * Brisbane General Hospital Group 20-30 Bowen Bridge Road, Herston, Queensland * Brisbane Grammar School (Honour Boards), 24 Gregory Terrace, Spring Hill, Queensland * Brunoy, 144-146 Beecroft Road, Beecroft, New South Wales * Church House, 417 Ann Street, Brisbane * Corbett and Son Store, 446-452 Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley, Queensland * Cressbrook Homestead, off Cressbrook-Caboombah Road, Toogoolawah, Queensland * Eagle Farm Racecourse (St Leger Stand), 230 Lancaster Road, Ascot, Queensland * Espie Dods House, 97 Wickham Terrace, Spring Hill, Queensland * Fenton and Garden, 8 Albert Street, Edgecliff, New South Wales * Fire Station (Former), 932-934 Bourke Street, Zetland, New South Wales * Franklyn Vale Homestead (summerhouse only), Franklin Vale Road, Grandchester, Queensland * Glengariff (1907 additions), 5 Derby Street, Hendra, Queensland * Guildford Fire Station, 263 Guildford Road, Guildford, New South Wales * Johnson's Building, 64-70 Palmerin Street, Warwick, Queensland * Killara, 92 Windermere Road, Ascot, Queensland * Kitawah, 59 Heath St, East Brisbane, Queensland * Lady Lamington Nurses Home, 282 Herston Road, Herston, Queensland * Lyndhurst, 3 London Road, Clayfield, Queensland * Manumbah, 64 Massey Street, Ascot, Queensland * Mardoc Building, Federal Street, Narrogin, Western Australia * Mark Foys Warehouse (Former), 133 Goulburn Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales * Maryborough City Hall, 388 Kent Street, Maryborough, Queensland * Mater Misericordiae Private and Former Public Hospitals, Raymond Terrace, South Brisbane, Queensland * Mount Carmel Convent, 199 Bay Terrace, Wynnum, Queensland * Mudgee Post Office, 80 Market Street, Mudgee, New South Wales * Myendetta Homestead Myendetta Station, Bakers Bend, Shire of Murweh, Queensland * Ringsfield House, Nanango, Queensland * Nindooinbah Homestead (1906 extensions), Nindooinbah House Road, Beaudesert, Queensland * Old Bishopsbourne, 233 Milton Road, Milton, Queensland * Old Bishopsbourne Chapel, 233 Milton Road, Milton, Queensland * Ralahyne (1904 alterations), 40 Enderley Road, Clayfield, Queensland * Rangemoor Circa 1910, 165 Adelaide Street East Clayfield, Queensland * Narallan, Abbott Street, 41 Abbott Street, New Farm, Queensland * Ruddle's Building, 327 Brunswick Street Mall, Fortitude Valley, Queensland * Shafston House, 23 Castlebar St, Kangaroo Point, Queensland * St Andrew's Anglican Church, Mangerton St, Toogoolawah, Queensland * St Brigid's Church, 78 Musgrave Road, Red Hill, Queensland * St Mark's Anglican Church, Junner Street, Dunwich, Queensland * St John's Cathedral, 401‚Äì413 Ann Street, Brisbane * TC Beirne Department Store, 28 Duncan Street, Fortitude Valley, Queensland * The Deanery (1909-10 verandahs), 417 Ann Street, Brisbane * The Newcastle Club, 40 Newcomen Street, Newcastle, New South Wales * Theosophical Society Building, 355 Wickham Terrace, Spring Hill, Queensland * Turrawan, 8 London Road, Clayfield, Queensland * Wairuna, 27 Hampstead Road, Highgate Hill, Queensland * Wattlebrae Hospital Group (former), 30 Bowen Bridge Road, Herston, Queensland * Webber House, 417-19 Ann Street, Brisbane * Willoughby Fire Station 53 Laurel Street, Willoughby, New South Wales He designed the school badge for Somerville House, a Brisbane private school in 1902.

Before the election in April 2006 the national Labour government removed their \\"statutory direction\\" of the council which had been put in place in 2003 after inspectors criticised the performance of the council. The council was now described as having made adequate progress, but the opposition Liberal Democrats criticised the timing of the announcement during the campaign for the local elections.

However immediately after the election they were not confident they would be able to get enough support from other parties to take control from Labour. Following the election the 2 Liberal and 3 of the various independent councillors met with the Labour leader of the council to discuss supporting them as they preferred Labour to the Liberal Democrats. However it was reported that regional Labour party officials told the party to go into opposition raising the possibility that neither party would form the administration.

Starring Peter Breck, Peggy McCay, Carroll O'Connor, and Angela Cartwright, the film blends several of the short stories featured in the novel, with the heroic Lad winning a rigged dog show, saving a handicapped girl from a snake, and capturing a poacher who killed his pups and injured one of his owners. Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from Vanguard Productions, and acquired the film rights for the other two Lad novels from the late Terhune's wife. Aram Avakian was initially selected to be the film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several of the short stories from the novel to create a single narrative, and adding in an all-purpose villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio hoped it would be successful enough to be followed by a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995. Plot Purebred rough collie Lad and his owners, Stephen (Peter Breck) and Elizabeth Tremayne (Peggy McCay), are visited by their wealthy neighbor Hamilcar Q. Glure (Carroll O'Connor) and his 8-year-old daughter Angela (Angela Cartwright), who is crippled from polio. While Lad befriends the girl, Glure invites the Tremaynes to show the prize-winning Lad at his upcoming dog show. However, Glure is jealous of Lad's success and has rigged one event to have such specialized rules that he believes only his recently purchased high- priced, English-trained collie can win. During the competition, which involves directing the dogs through a tricky set of a maneuvers, Lad is able to complete the course, while Glure's champion does not recognize the hand signals Glure makes while holding a cigar. Later, Lad saves Glure's daughter Angela from a poisonous snake by knocking her backwards to get her out of harm's way, then fighting and killing the snake, getting bitten in the process. Her nurse (Alice Pearce) initially does not see the snake, and begins beating Lad for \\"attacking\\" the little girl. Distraught, Angela stands and walks for the first time since her illness to stop the nurse's abuse of her friend. Lad disappears for three days, reappearing covered in mud but cured of the poison. After his return, Lad is bred with another prize-winning collie, Lady, and they have two male puppies which are named Little Lad and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they are old enough to leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher Lad fought and chased off the property before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little Lad, and refuses to have anything to do with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog. Production Max J. Rosenberg, of Vanguard Productions, purchased the film rights for Albert Payson Terhune's Lad: A Dog from publisher E.P. Dutton, then later sold the rights to Warner Brothers. When the studio learned of the other two Lad novels, Further Adventures of Lad and Lad of Sunnybank, they were concerned to learn that Dutton had the rights to only the first novel, as they were hoping the film would be successful enough to develop a sequel and possibly a television series. Executive Bruce Chapman negotiated for the film rights for the other two novels with Anice Terhune, the wife of the late author. She set up a foundation, Terhune Lad Stories, Inc, to negotiate the rights for other two novels. All told, Warner paid $25,000 for the rights to all three books, though the bulk of the funds went to Dutton. Warner Brothers initially hired Aram Avakian, a \\"talented, aggressive young ex-film editor\\" known for his avant-garde tendencies, to direct the film. The studio wanted a sentimental dog story that played true to the novel, which Avakian opposed. In a 1969 Life interview, Avakian stated that he \\"wanted to make a kind of pop, camp thing that wouldn't be a complete ordeal for parents\\" while everyone else involved in the production wanted \\"Dick, Jane and Doggie\\". Jack Warner, then head of the studio, eventually fired him, bringing the more conventional Leslie H. Martinson to complete the film. Peter Breck and Peggy McCay were cast as Lad's owners, renamed to Stephen and Elizabeth Tremayne. Veteran actor Carroll O'Connor was hired to play the pompous and newly wealthy Hamilcar Q. Glure, with the role of his daughter played by Angela Cartwright, a noted young actress who had starred in The Danny Thomas Show. To cast the role of Lad, a talent search was conducted, eventually resulting in the selection of a collie from the San Fernando Valley who was credited simply as \\"Lad\\". The film is set in a modified version of the Place, with Pompton Lake reduced to a river with a large dock. The house, though similar to the real Terhune home, even including duplicates of the stone lions on the veranda, was built on a scale three times larger than the original. Well-known screenwriter Lillie Hayward, and newcomer Roberta Hodes, were hired to adapt the novel for film. They combined several of the stories from the novel, modifying characters to create a single flowing narrative. For example, the crippled girl who was a neighbor girl in the original novel became Glure's daughter. Noting Terhune's frequent disdain for the Ramapough Mountain Indians, they named the film's villain Jackson White, a play on the nickname used to refer to those people. White became the catch all villain of the film, who poaches deer, sets fire to the Tremayne barn, and break into the house to try to steal a gold trophy won by Lad. Lad: A Dog was released to theaters on June 6, 1962. The 98 minute film was released to VHS format on January 31, 1995. Reception The film was considered to be a \\"B-movie\\" with its low production budget. Terhune biographer Irving Litvag praised O'Connor's performance as Glure, feeling his talent made him \\"seem human\\" and \\"a person of dignity and love\\" versus Terhune's \\"overdrawn and exaggerated\\" silly character. He felt the setting and cinematography was \\"typical Hollywood overstatement\\", and that as a whole found that Terhune's \\"sentimental writing\\" did not do well in film form, calling the resulting film \\"cloying\\" and a \\"minor, unsung film.\\" However, he noted that fans of the novels seemed to thoroughly enjoy the film, suspecting part of it was the \\"handsome collie\\" found to play the titular role, and seeing the names of the beloved collies they knew on the screen. A New York Times reviewer called it a \\"bucolic drama of no discernible merit\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the dog actors, but felt the film was \\"stultifyingly mawkish, with a touch of supposed humor contributed by an allegedly English chauffeur\\". Bob Ross, of the Tampa Tribune, considered it to be an \\"earnest, well-acted story\\". Leonard Maltin felt it was a \\"genuine if schmaltzy\\" adaptation of the novel.

It was pioneered in the convenience grocery sector convenience grocery sector in Europe.  How it works  The process is orchestrated by a middleman (wholesaler) who takes certain risks in order to profit from the process.  Typical example  A convenience store retailer takes delivery every day of bread, milk and other perishable items. Instead of paying cash they put them on the central billing account they holds with their wholesaler. At the end of the month they receive a bill from their wholesaler for all their purchases for the month. The wholesaler in turn pays the individual suppliers.  Benefits to supplier  The supplier still has to make multiple deliveries but instead of having to worry about collecting money from many individual stores it only collects one payment from the wholesaler. By this process the credit risk is removed from the supplier and placed on the wholesaler. In return for this the supplier makes a payment to the wholesaler to reflect these benefits, called a rebate or Long Term Agreement.  Benefit to retailer  The retailer benefits simply by the fact their admin is simplified. Instead of having to monitor many daily payments they simply have to write one cheque a month for potentially thousands of transactions. The pay the wholesaler who in turn pays the suppliers. In addition, they typically receive a rebate (LTA) on their purchases.  Benefit to wholesaler  The wholesaler benefits in a number of ways. Firstly they do not have to pass on in full all the LTA payments they receive. Secondly the offer a valuable service to retailers to whom they also sell other items to through their traditional wholesale channels. They do however assume the risk should the retailer fail to pay.  Centralised distribution  In many cases central billing has been superseded by central distribution. Under the centralised distribution model a wholesaler will provide everything their customer needs via their own supply chain. This eradicates the need for supplier deliveries and renders central billing redundant.

Background The plant is one of the largest global producers of manganese alloys, and is situated in the Dnepropetrovsk region of Ukraine, close to large manganese ore deposits. The two main products of the plant are Ferromanganese (FeMn) and Ferrosilicomanganese (FeSiMn) Plant capacity is over 1 million metric tonnes of silicomanganese and 250,000 tonnes of high carbon ferromanganese, along with significant production capabilities in materials required for manganese production (fluxes). Additionally waste slag supplies the construction industry. The alloys are produced from manganese ore and coke in an electric arc furnace. Company history In 1958 the USSR council of ministers gave a decree for the construction of a manganese ferroalloy plant at Nikopol in Ukraine. Including the factory buildings a water supply and electricity supply had also to be built. By 1966 the factory was sufficiently complete for the first tapping of No.1 furnace. By 1975 over 2 million tonnes of silico-manganese had been produced. In the troubled times of the 1990s brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence the factory had difficulty obtaining raw materials, and even the electricity to power the furnaces was in short supply. Nevertheless, by 2004 furnace No. 14 produced its first million tons of alloy. Privatisation and de-privatisation In 2003 as part of a governmental privatisation plan a 50% stake in the plant was sold to Interpipe Group for 80million dollars considered to be a fraction of its true worth. A further 26% was acquired by the Privat Group. The sale later became part of a political scandal in Ukraine relating to privatisations as well as court proceedings to undo the privatisation. The situation echos similar problems with the privatisation of other major Ukrainian industrial concerns, including Luhanskteplovoz and Kryvorizhstal; both being also sold for under market value, in privatisation sales that were later reversed. The company was also fought over by the two major stake holders Privat Group and Interpipe. Investigations into abuse of authority by the state officials during the initial privatisation have taken place, and the sale was declared illegal in 2005 with attempts to block any further privatisation attempts made in 2006.

Early history During the reign of Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Qajar king, evidence has shown attempts to import leather processing machinery from the West, proving Iran's quest to build leather factories extended beyond the early 1900s.Sazman-e Asnad-e Melli-e Iran After the bombardment and closure of the First Parliament, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar ordered the establishment of a new assembly within Iran. The members of this newfound assembly discussed an agreement to build up a modern leather factory.Ettehadieh, Mansoreh. Majlis va Entekhabat, Nashr-e Tarikh-e Iran, 1375, Tehran, page 118. Prior to this agreement, Iran only enacted traditional tanneries (dabbaghi) for leather production.for more information see dabbaghi in http://www.iranicaonline.org/ Foreign Involvement During the first Pahlavi era, German companies started to invest in the Iranian leather industry. As a result, the Khosravi leather factory was built in Tabriz in 1931/32 (1310 Iranian calendar) with 533 workers,Sazman-e Asnad-e Melli-e Iran http://www.nlai.ir// the largest and most modern of the time. After the Second World War, during the second Pahlavi era, this industry started to develop with factories mainly in the south of Tehran (Shahr-e-Rey) and Tabriz. These were chiefly private companies who were able to import Western machinery, mostly from Germany and Italy. The use of Western chemical products in the process of leather making also increased the quality of Iranian leather. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution During the 1970s, the leather industry was one of the most lucrative businesses in Iran. Before the revolution, Iranians were able to build some of the machinery, such as gear boxes for the wooden drums used for washing the leather. After the 1979 Islamic revolution, sanctions against Iran affected the leather industry. As a result of these sanctions, some Iranian chemical companies began to produce chemical products for the industry and the manufacturers of leather processing machinery developed as well. Fleshing Machines built in Tabriz,1980s Advancing Technology Afterwards, more complicated machinery, such as fleshing machines, were first built in Tabriz. The use of these machines continued until the production of more advanced mechanical and electrical machines. The leather industry in Tabriz started to use one of the most advanced machines built in Iran.

Later the company, Hydro Charm emerged and produced other leather processing machines.interview with the council of leather manufacturer of Tabriz February 2005 The leather industry flourished after the revolution and was taking advantage of government subsidies until its support was restricted. This was due to the inferior quality of Iranian leather which caused difficulty in producers finding markets outside Iran to export along with the import of Chinese products. This forced some factories to close by the end of the twentieth century and many workers also lost their jobs http://www.irna.ir/View/FullSgtory/?NewsId=732569&IdZone;=46 A report reveals that \\"1500 workers have lost their jobs following the continuing shutdown of leather producing factories in the city of Mashhad. Presently, Iranian leather export primarily focuses on trade of raw hides and skins at low sale price. The Iranian government encourages the industry to process high added value products of leather goods, leather shoes and leather clothing so as to increase the industry's profits\\". Impact 170 leather companies are still active in Iran with the annual production of 4 million and 334 thousand square feet of leather annually. Most of the leather companies belong to the private sector, yet most these factories just work with 40% of their capacity despite the high investments in leather industry in the country. Despite the industry's long history and skin hide proficiency, Iranian products have not achieved a significant place in the international markets.nassajiemrouz.com References Leather Category:Leather industry ","title":"Iranian leather industry"},{"id":"24977554","text":"Shadow Kiss is a vampire novel written by Richelle Mead. It is the third novel in the Vampire Academy series, and was preceded by Frostbite.Amazon.com: Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy, Book 3) The release of the book pushed the Vampire Academy series into the New York Times Best Seller list for the first time, making its debut at #4.New York Times Children's Books Bestseller Lists, 21 November 2008 Shadow Kiss continues the story of the main character, Rose Hathaway and her education in becoming a Guardian.  Plot  Rose, in shock over Mason's death, prepares with the rest of the novices for the Qualifying Exam, in which the novices protect the Moroi students from \\"attacks\\" by \\"Strigoi\\" (their Dhampir teachers). Rose is positive that she will be paired with Lissa, but instead is paired with Christian Ozera, while Eddie Castile (Mason's best friend) is paired with Lissa. Rose complains to her teachers, but ultimately resigns herself to guarding Christian. During the first attack on Christian, Rose sees Mason's ghost and freezes - and is accused of being a sore loser by her teachers. In a sudden twist, Christian is the only person who truly believes that Rose didn't screw up on purpose. Meanwhile, Rose overhears that Victor Dashkov's trial is coming soon - and that she and Lissa aren't going to be called to testify. She begs Dimitri to find a way to get them into the trial, and he promises to see what he can do. Adrian and Lissa are growing closer (in a teacher-student sense) while practicing their Spirit use, making Christian jealous. After Rose settles a fight between Lissa and Christian, she begins to sense changes in herself - mainly feelings of intense anger (even more than is usual). Christian is also approached by Jesse Zeklos to join a secret \\"club\\" he and Ralf have started, though Christian turns them down. Rose becomes suspicious, and tries to learn more about this club, which she later learns is called \\"M√¢nƒÉ\\". Although Dimitri attempts to get Rose and Lissa into court to testify, it is ultimately Adrian who gains them entry. On the plane ride to Court, Rose is struck with a horrible migraine, but shakes it off as they arrive at Court; Dimitri and Alberta accompany Rose, Lissa, Christian, Eddie, and Adrian. Dimitri and Rose go to visit Victor in jail, who is as maddeningly pleasant as ever, and threatens to reveal what really happened between Dimitri and Rose the night he kidnapped Lissa. Dimitri threatens to have him killed in jail, but Victor taunts them with his knowledge. The day of the trial, Victor does reveal that Rose and Dimitri almost slept together, but everyone in the courtroom automatically believe this to be another one of Victor's lies. He is sent to prison by the court. Lissa meets with Queen Tatiana to discuss her future; she agrees to go to a college close to Court, and voices her opinion on Moroi fighting with Dhamphirs. Rose goes in to meet with Tatiana next - who insists that Rose stop sleeping with Adrian and call off their \\"engagement\\". Rose is stunned, and listens to Tatiana call her everything but a whore. Tatiana then reveals that she has been planning a marriage between Adrian and Lissa, and that they don't need to be carrying any of her \\"emotional baggage\\" around with them. Rose shrugs off the queen's accusations and meets up with Lissa, lying to her about her conversation with the queen. Lissa takes Rose for a manicure, where Rose is treated by a young man, Ambrose, who turns out to be a Dhamphir and the queen's blood whore. He takes Lissa and Rose to a fortune teller, who gives Rose a rather boring reading. Dimitri finds them and agrees to have his fortune read. The fortune teller predicts that Dimitri will \\"lose that which he treasures most\\". On the plane ride back to the Academy, Rose gets another horrible migraine, this time drawing the attention of Alberta and Dimitri. When they are forced to make an unscheduled stop at a human airport to refuel during a snow storm, Rose's migraine becomes much worse, and when she steps off the plane, she sees the ghosts of Lissa's parents and brother, along with many others. When she comes to, she is in the infirmary back at the Academy. Rose is finally forced to come clean about seeing Mason's ghost, and she is ordered to see a counselor. Her \\"guardian time\\" with Christian is also limited. While back at school, her temper still increases, though she does successfully defeat Dimitri as a \\"Strigoi\\" while guarding Christian. Lissa is approached by Jesse and Ralf to join M√¢nƒÉ, and she accepts their invitation as a chance to spy on them, without Rose's knowing. Lissa is led into the woods and attacked by Jesse and the other magic users. Rose senses something is terribly wrong and runs to Lissa's aid. She beats Lissa's torturers ‚Äì fellow students ‚Äî and Lissa tortures Jesse using Spirit. Rose realizes that whenever Lissa uses Spirit, dark emotions fill Lissa ‚Äî which caused her to cut herself in the first book ‚Äî and tells Lissa to let the dark emotion flow through their connection and into Rose ‚Äî which is what has been causing Rose's mood swings and violent behavior. Lissa obeys, and Rose suddenly begins beating Jesse fiercely. Alberta and Dimitri appear, and Alberta has several guards take Jesse away, while ordering Dimitri to handle Rose, who is still in a manic state. Dimitri takes Rose to an old cabin that Tasha Ozera stayed in when she visited the Academy. Rose attempts to run to the infirmary, where she knows they would take Jesse, but Dimitri subdues her and forces her to let go of her anger. She collapses, terrified that she is going crazy. Dimitri listens to Rose's explanation and insists that he won't let Rose go crazy. They then make love thus causing Rose to lose her virginity . Sometime during the night, Rose senses death nearby. It turns out to be a Strigoi. She's sent to the Moroi dorms. Here she and the other novices are told to stay put. Rose is sent to guard a small window, where she is finally given a silver stake. She senses immense fear from Lissa, and learns that Christian is in the church, where he was supposed to meet Lissa to talk about Jesse and M√¢nƒÉ. Eddie and several other novices are guarding Lissa and the other Moroi, so Rose sneaks out the small window to go after Christian. She and Christian rush to the elementary school, where there would be much less security, and combine Rose's fighting skills and Strigoi sense with Christian's Fire magic to destroy many Strigoi. After the battle, Rose learns that this is one of the biggest groups of Strigoi - who are typically loners - to ever attack any Moroi or Dhamphirs. Along with many dead guardians and Moroi, several Dhamphirs and Moroi were captured by the retreating Strigoi ‚Äî including Eddie. Rose's mother, Janine, comes to the aid of the guardians with reinforcements, and with Mason's help, Rose figures out where the Strigoi are holding the hostages. Before they leave, Dimitri tells Rose that he is going to ask to be placed with a different Moroi close to Court, so that he and Rose can be together. Janine, Dimitri, and Rose plan a counterattack, and reluctantly enlist the help of other Dhamphir novices and, surprisingly, several Moroi teachers to harness their power as a weapon. When the army reaches the caves the Strigoi are hiding in, Rose is forced to stay outside while Janine and Dimitri lead the attack inside. Once all the hostages are out, Rose goes into the caves to assist the retreat. Just as she thinks everyone she loves is safe, Dimitri is attacked and left behind as Janine forces Rose out of the caves. Rose later finds out that Dimitri's body wasn't found. Another team of guardians returns to the caves the next day, confirming that Dimitri was not killed, but was made Strigoi. Rose realizes that the fortune teller's prediction came true: \\"you will lose what you value most so treasure it while you can\\" - not herself, as Rose believed, but his soul. Rose decides to leave the Academy to go after Dimitri and kill him. After she files the necessary papers, Lissa meets her just before she leaves and reveals that she figured out Rose was in love with Dimitri. Lissa begs Rose to stay, even tries to use compulsion on her, but Rose snaps and tells Lissa that all her life she's been told that Lissa comes first. Rose says that she needs to do something for herself for once. Rose asks Adrian for money, which he willingly gives to her, and asks her if she will come back. Rose says she will eventually, and tells Adrian that she will give him a chance - go out with him - when she comes back. As she leaves the Academy, Rose says good bye to Mason, then heads off to Siberia, where she believes Dimitri would go first; back to his hometown.

Childhood and education He was born in Kidderminster, England. After his mother's death, he was adopted by her sister, Miss Follows, who lived with her aged father. Mountford always spoke of her with affectionate respect: she was a great reader, and did what she could to teach the children of the poor. He was a delicate child; and the limp, which was one of his peculiarities, was the result of early weakness. Once he was nearly drowned in the River Stour, from which he was dragged out senseless. He went to Pearsall's Grammar School; and \\"his intelligence and his quiet studious habits soon won for him the esteem of the schoolmaster, the Rev. Evan Jones\\", who left him his library. He there became known to the Rev. J. Kentish, of Birmingham, who encouraged him to prepare for entrance at York College. While attending the school of the Rev. E. Bristow at Birmingham, he boarded with Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Carpenter, who being without children of their own, were glad to have such an inmate. He wrote that one of his hosts \\"had much to do with my tone of thinking and independence. I venerate his memory, and love it. It was an unbroken time of happiness that I passed at King Alfred's Place.\\" During his vacation, he paid a week's visit to Mr. Kentish, who helped him in the purchase of books. Mountford entered Manchester College in York in 1813, then aged about seventeen. In many of his letters, he expressed his thankfulness for his training among the English Presbyterians, and the accurate scholarship of his learned tutors: \\"If Mr. Wellbeloved did not show us all truth, he gave us that honesty and freedom of thought which are the master-keys of all knowledge, sooner or later.\\" In his earlier sessions, though he was a painstaking student, he gave no promise of eminence. Towards the end of his course, he seemed kindled with fresh thoughts. While in York, Mountford came under the influence of James Martineau, and renounced the philosophy of Hartley and Mill. He astonished the little congregation supplied by the students with a vehemence and fervor they little anticipated, for he was very short in stature, and boyish in appearance. Early work as a clergyman Within a month after leaving college (8 July 1838), he commenced his ministry at the Strangeways Chapel, Manchester (opened 17 June). It had been built for the Greengate congregation, founded by the Rev. J. R. Beard (D.D. in 1841). An unfortunate dispute had, however, arisen; and those who claimed the new chapel wished to appoint a new minister. Mountford had consulted Mr. Kentish, who told him that he had no right to decline; but he little anticipated the difficulties that beset him. The leading ministers of the district resented the exclusion of their able and zealous friend, and the ardent young preacher felt himself unwelcome. He was never so unhappy in his life. He worked, however, with great energy, overdoing himself ‚Äî and his hearers; for some of his doctrinal lectures were nearly an hour and a half in length. He was also a laborious student; but his health suffered, and after about three years he resigned. On 21 October 1841, a massive silver inkstand and a purse of ¬£60 were presented to him at a congregational meeting. Sir T. Potter, who presided, said that \\"their late esteemed pastor had secured their warmest approbation and affectionate regard.\\" (Dr. Beard subsequently became the minister of the chapel.) After a short ministry at Hinckley, he moved to Lynn, Norfolk. In February 1814 he wrote, after a long interval: \\"Ill health does not make me communicative. The last six months before leaving Manchester and eighteen subsequent months I was very ill. Also, when one of your letters reached me, I was in want of some of the necessaries of life, owing to a heavy loss which I sustained in endeavoring to assist some persons. ... It is good for me to have been afflicted. I have more peace of mind than I have possessed at any time since leaving college. My hair, which had begun to turn gray, is now as black as formerly.\\" He speaks of having travelled abroad; and perhaps at this time he obtained the degree of Ph.D., M.A., at a German university. He styled himself \\"M.A.\\" in only one of his books: on the title pages of the rest, he is simply called \\"William Mountford.\\" His salary was now only ¬£70 a year; and he lived chiefly on brown bread and milk, that he might be able to buy books. Visit to and retirement in the United States Mountford had long wished to visit the United States, and in 1849, Dr. Huntington obtained a free passage for him. He sailed in November, arriving in Boston early in 1850 and preaching in Dr. Huntington's church the next Sunday morning, and the following Thursday, 17 January. He preached for a time at the Unitarian church at Washington, D.C., where President Millard Fillmore had a seat and Daniel Webster and Edward Everett were occasional attendants. In the summer of 1851, he had preached at Nahant, a favorite seaside resort about twelve miles from Boston. Among his hearers was Miss E. Crowninshield, who Mountford married in March, 1853. At her wish, he resigned his pastoral charge, though he preached occasionally. They resided at her house in Boston after spending the summer at Nahant. The Mountfords were in Europe from 1858 to 1860. He preached only at York and Hampstead. Interesting and characteristic letters on his travels appeared in the Quarterly Journal of the American Unitarian Association. They stayed a long time in Rome, where \\"the subject of the supernatural\\" grew on him \\"as to importance, and deepened as to interest\\". In a second visit, 1867, he preached at Bridport (2 June) with great power and earnestness on the \\"Open Vision\\". Between these journeys, he had been writing a book, for which he studied the Fathers and Neo-Platonists; but he resolved not to speak of it till it was finished. It was not printed; but it probably contained the substance of five articles on \\"The Miraculous\\" in the Monthly Religious Magazine in 1868-69. These excited great attention, and were praised both by the Orthodox and the Radicals, so that he was encouraged to add another on \\" The Outburst of Spiritualism\\". Mountford ultimately retired to Cambridge, Massachusetts. His works include Christianity: the Deliverance of the Soul and its Life (1846); Martyria: a Legend (1846); Euthanasy, or Happy Talks toward the End of Life (1850); Beauties of Channing (1852); Thorpe: a Quiet English Town and Life Therein, based on Hinckley, Leicestershire (1852); and Miracles Past and Present (1870). He died in Boston. Sources * Russel L. Carpenter, \\"William Mountford\\", in Joseph Henry Allen, ed., The Unitarian Review (1887), p. 592-599.

She is the technical analyst of the Behavioral Analysis Unit that is the center of both shows. She has also made multiple guest appearances on Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, making her the only character in the franchise to appear in all three of its series. Life before the BAU Garcia is from San Francisco, California. A drunk driver killed her parents in a car accident when she was eighteen, and she now helps counsel the families of murder victims in her spare time. Garcia has stated that after her parents died, she dropped out of Caltech and went \\"underground\\" but continued to teach herself computer coding. She had been placed on one of the FBI's hacker lists (she was one of a small handful of extremely useful or dangerous hackers in the world), and they recruited her from there. It has also been mentioned, when she was not allowed to travel with the team to Langley, that she was on the CIA's \\"lists\\" as well. JJ joked that Garcia belonged to that list when she (successfully) tried to hack the CIA for information (namely, Prince William's cellphone number) and information on Diana, Princess of Wales' death and other government conspiracies. Penelope is into online games, specifically MMOGs, as she was once seen playing a game about Camelot on the BAU network, constantly virtually meeting with \\"Sir Kneighf\\", an online alter ego who turns out to be Randall Garner, who is keeping a young woman prisoner while sending the team several clues that, with tremendous help from Reid, they use to catch him and save the woman. Garner hacked into Garcia's computer and accessed files about the BAU, then used the personal information to find out their whereabouts so he could send the clues there. At the end of the Season 6 episode \\"Compromising Positions\\", Hotch comments that Garcia submitted her handwritten resume on pink stationery when she applied for a job at the FBI. The Season 9 episode \\"The Black Queen\\" reveals that Penelope was arrested by the FBI in San Jose, California after she hacked into the computer systems of a cosmetics company, prompted by outrage over its use of animals in product testing. Hotch offered her a choice of facing prosecution or joining the BAU to help track down serial killers; when she reacted with disdain, he noted her scrupulous morality in choosing targets. Penelope accepted the job and hand-wrote a r√©sum√© for Hotch to give to the FBI's human resources department, using the aforementioned pink stationery that she had in her purse. Criminal Minds :) Garcia is unabashedly emotional, which sometimes makes her job with the BAU more difficult. She has broken down, crying several times while listening to and watching terrifying things in her office as she analyzes them for the team. However, according to Agent Hotchner, she \\"fills her office with figurines and color to remind herself to smile as the horror fills her screens\\". Garcia is, on the whole, an optimist. She has managed to remain so, even though the job occasionally requires her to dig into people's secret lives, to \\"find the god-awful thing that happened to them that made them do the god-awful thing to someone else\\". Many team members have commented in various ways, that her optimism is an aid to them, that (as Hotch said) they would never want her to change. He once commented to Reid and JJ, after contacting Garcia during a case, \\"Remind me to have her drug tested,\\" indicating her optimism could even be too much at times. Garcia was once shot by a man with whom she had just gone on a date, but survived when the bullet missed her heart and ricocheted into her abdomen. The attacker (who turned out to be a type of serial killer known as a 'hero homicide') was later killed. After this incident, Morgan insisted she keep a gun; however, it is never shown whether she took this advice. She was romantically involved with fellow FBI Technical Analyst Kevin Lynch (played by Nicholas Brendon). Garcia seems to have been the one most hurt by JJ transferring out of the Behavioral Analysis Unit. In the Season 6 episode \\"Compromising Positions\\", Garcia volunteered to replace JJ as their new Media Liaison, but soon discovered that she was not suited for the job. She returned to her analyst duties after the case was closed, but was given the option to travel to crime scenes with the team as needed. She was also emotional in the episode \\"Lauren\\" when Prentiss is stabbed by her nemesis, Ian Doyle. JJ joins the team waiting in the hospital lounge for results to inform them that Prentiss \\"never made it off the table\\". We see that Garcia can tell the news is not good by the look on JJ's face. In \\"Hanley Waters\\", she is interviewed by Hotch about Prentiss' \\"apparent death\\" and says she wants to talk about the times when Prentiss made her happy instead of about her being gone. Garcia is extremely and emotionally excited when she learns that Prentiss is alive and shocked when she returns. She's also quick to forgive her, JJ, and Hotch for the deception. It is also revealed that she has been taking care of Emily's cat, Sergio, and when Emily inquires about him, Garcia promptly demands visitation rights. Garcia is afraid of losing a partner, as she risked her career by taking down a federal website to stop her boyfriend, Kevin Lynch, from being transferred out of country for a job, though after she accidentally let a detail slip while talking to him, he was annoyed slightly, but happy for the action on her part. Details about why her parents died in a car accident are revealed in season 7 when Garcia is overseeing a support group and sharing her loss, telling the group they died looking for Garcia after she didn't return home by curfew. Her moment of truth came in the 9th season episode \\"Demons\\" when she was forced to shoot an assassin sent to kill Reid by a corrupt sheriffs deputy. Reid had been in a hospital after being shot in the previous episode. In an attempt to get some closure, she communicates with the man she shot while he's on death row and later goes to his execution. Garcia is extremely close to JJ and Emily Prentiss. Time and again they have \\"Girls Night Out\\" which lasted till early morning instead of a couple of hours. Garcia is godmother of both JJ's sons and Derek Morgan's son as well. After Morgan's departure and the addition of Luke Alvez to the BAU, Garcia becomes uncharacteristically distant and withdrawn from him, frequently calling him 'Newbie.' Later, Alvez and she find some common ground after she discovers that Roxie, who she assumed was Luke's girlfriend, is actually his dog. In the season twelve finale, Morgan returned after Peter Lewis tried to coax out the team and asked Garcia to cut him some slack, despite her reluctance. In season 13, Garcia ends up going to the field with Simmons to track down Peter Lewis. She also showed that she had not yet been able to overcome the trauma from her shooting. Derek Morgan ended up coming back to give her emotional support. Penelope searches for a new apartment soon after stating that her neighbor practice Kung Fu naked and there are things she can't forget. She also had to break into the encounter with Luke and his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Penelope got the case responsible for putting the team back together after the separation imposed by Linda Barnes. She helped Rossi unravel her stepdaughter Portia's ex-fianc√©. In the episode \\"All You Can Eat\\" she returns to her California home in order to hold responsible the man who caused her parents' death, but she ends up forgiving the man trying to make the guilt she feels end. Penelope is kidnapped by the cult of Benjamin Merva in the final episode of the season. She and Reid are held hostage by the killers, but with the help of Reid, Penelope manages to escape, running over Mary Meadows and going to the BAU. Penelope ends up having another stressful situation, which ends up being helped by Emily Prentiss and David Rossi. Penelope and Luke work together on two cases in the season. She reveals to Luke in the \\"Saturday\\" episode that she has a Russian stalker during a stalking case involving one of her students at a Hacker Workshop at BAU headquarters In episode 9 of season 15, Penelope reveals that she is considering accepting a job offer at an independent institution. She says it would be a good change. In the final episode, the team celebrates Penelope's departure and Luke invites her to dinner during her team's farewell party. Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior The character of Garcia also appeared in the spin-off Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior as a series regular. Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders The character of Garcia also appeared in the spin-off Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders. Her first appearance was in season one in a scene with Russ \\"Monty\\" Montgomery, where Monty hides Garcia's octopus mug and claims not to have it. In July 2016, it was announced that Garcia would make several appearances in season 2.

Muchundi Mosque holds a granite inscription datable to c. 13th century AD.Proceedings - Indian History Congress, 59th Session Patiala. Indian History Congress (1999) pp. 396 - 402 The inscription is the only surviving document recording endowment by a Hindu king (the Zamorin of Calicut) to the Muslims of Kerala. As per the inscription, the mosque was established by certain Shahab al-din Raihan. Historians tentatively assume that \\"Muchiyan\\" might be the Old Malayalam name given to Raihan by the people of Kozhikode. Raihan must have been a wealthy Arab merchant settled at Kozhikode. A medieval Muslim aristocratic house called \\"Muchintakam\\" is situated close to the mosque. A traditional jaram ‚Äì a mausoleum/tomb ‚Äì called \\"Muchiyante Jaram\\" is also found near the mosque. The Zamorins of Calicut remained the protectors of the mosque throughout the medieval times. The salary of the qadi of the mosque was paid by from Kozhikode. The mosque is sometimes associated with Shaikh Zain-ud-Din Makhdum II, the 16th century polymath, and the famous author of Tuhafat al- Mujahidin.  Muchundi Mosque Inscription  W. Logan (1841‚Äì1914) was the first person to understand the significance of the Muchundi Mosque Inscription Muchundi Inscription. The left portion contains Vattezhuthu characters (Old Malayalam) and the right portion contains Arabic characters William Logan, former Collector and Magistrate of Malabar District, makes a reference to the Muchundi Inscription in his famous manual Malabar (1887). The mosque was called \\"Machchinde Mosque\\" by W. Logan. The inscription was eventually deciphered by historians M. G. S. Narayanan, M. R. Raghava Warrier and Kunhu Muhammed. The highly damaged, worn and fragmentary donative inscription is engraved on a granite stone slab (slab is seen as fixed on the wall at Mosque Muchundi). The inscription is undated, but can be positioned on paleographic grounds to the c. 13th century AD. The content is divided on functional grounds between Old Malayalam and Arabic. The concluding portion is in Arabic, while the functional portion recording the specific details of the endowment is in Old Malayalam. The script of the Old Malayalam portion is Vattezhuthu, a type of medieval script closely related to modern Malayalam and Tamil. The letters are not carved into the stone surface ‚Äì like the usual Kodungallur Chera style ‚Äì but are raised on the stone in imitation of the standard practice in Islamic inscriptions. Text The text is divided into two distinct halves. First half has 32 very short Vattezhuthu lines in Old Malayalam. It describes the assignment of revenues accruing from certain lands for the expenditure of Muchundi Mosque. The inscription mentions two local place names, \\"Kunnamangalam\\" and \\"Pulikkizhu\\". As per M. G. S. Narayanan, the old Malayalam (Vatteluttu) portion can be read as, \\"This is an order of Punturakkon, this is to...by the Officer - in - Attendance (Kettu Viliyan). He ordered that daily expenses of one nazhi [of rice should be] granted to the Muchiyan's Mosque...He ordered that from Kunnamangalam...Pulikkizhu...to the Mosque...future also...Twelve para...\\" The Arabic portion, the second half, starts with the opening prayer from Qur'an.

The Jebel Qatrani Formation (also Gebel Qatrani) is a palaeontological and geologic formation located in the Faiyum Governorate of central Egypt. Conformably overlying the Qasr el Sagha Formation. It is exposed namely between the Jebel Qatrani escarpment and the Qasr el Sagha escarpment, north of Birket Qarun lake near Faiyum. Geology These rocks were laid down in the Eocene-Oligocene period (Priabonian - Rupelian). This formation was originally thought to be between 35.4 and 33.3 million years old, based on initial analysis of the formation. However, analysis by Erik Seiffert in 2006 concluded that the age of the Jebel Qatrani Formation should be revised. His assessment of more recent evidence indicates an age for most of the formation of between 30.2 and 29.5 million years ago, placing it almost entirely in the Early Oligocene. Seiffert states that only the lowest 48 metres was laid down in the Eocene, but recent opinion holds the original hypothesis of a sediment straddling the Eocene-Oligocene boundary to be correct. Mostly sandstones deposited by meandering rivers and seasonal lakes, the lower (Eocene) part of the formation represents a woodlanded ecosystem of which much petrified wood also remains. In contrast, the upper (Oligocene) layers present indication of much drier and cooler conditions, with savanna replacing the woodland for several million years before the climate turned wetter and warmer again and the forests regrew.

It lies mainly south of Maseru, near Burgersdorp, Aliwal North, Dordrecht, Molteno, and Elliot. It extends as far north as Matatiele in the Eastern Cape. The formation's localities lie along the Drakensberg Mountains in Kwazulu-Natal, and near Ladybrand in the Free State of South Africa. The Molteno Formation is the lowermost of the three formations in the Stormberg Group of the greater Karoo Supergroup. The Molteno Formation represents the initial phase of preserved sedimentation of the Stormberg Group.  Geology  Late Triassic (220 Ma) View towards Stormberg Mountains near Molteno, Eastern Cape The Molteno Formation is the lowermost geological formation of the Stormberg Group. The Molteno Formation overlies the Burgersdorp Formation of the Beaufort Group, and underlies the lower Elliot Formation (LEF). The Molteno Formation contains alternating finely- grained, medium-grained, and coarse-grained sandstones, and greyish mudstone layers. The coarser sandstones exhibiting trough cross-bedding structures. The mudstones also contain siltstones. The sandstones contain secondary quartz over growths and clasts, giving them a distinctive glittering appearance. Finer-grained sandstones occur throughout the lower deposits of the Molteno Formation, growing coarser toward the upper sections. Sporadic coal seams populate the Molteno Formation, and less common quartz pebble and cobble conglomerates occur in the lower sections. These geological features form part of six stacked fining upward cycles where repeating patterns of the coarser- grained rocks (conglomerates, coarse-grained sandstones) grade upwards into finer-grained rocks (medium to fine-grained sandstone, mudrocks, and coal seams). Sandstones are more common in the lower deposits while mudstones are more dominant in the upper deposits. However, the mudstones are part of repeating fining upward cycles with coarser-grained sandstones and thin coal seams. The Molteno Formation comprises five members, from oldest to youngest: * Bamboesberg Member: (>) The lowermost member of the Molteno Formation, it is only found in southern/southeastern deposits where it rests conformably over rocks of the Beaufort Group. It is composed almost entirely of fine to medium- grained sandstone, which exhibit fining upward sequences. It also contains thin, lenticular mudstone and siltstone intercalations. In the uppermost sections, two thin coal seams (Indwe and Guba Seams) appear. The Guba Seam caps the Bamboesberg member at its top. * Indwe Sandstone Member: (>) This member constitutes the base of the Molteno Formation in its northern localities, lying unconformably over Beaufort Group rocks. Composed primarily of sandstone, these fine upwards although are very coarse-grained in its lower sections. An extremely coarse bed of pebble and cobble conglomerates sits at the base of this member. * Mayaputi Member: (>) This member is rich in argillaceous mudstone. A coal seam called the Cala Pass Seam caps this member. * Qiba Member: (>) This member contains fine to medium-grained sandstone, thin mudstone layers, and a single coal seam called the Ulin Seam. * Tsomo Member: (>) The thickest of the Molteno Formation members, the Tsomo Member exhibits repetitive successions of coarse-grained, pebbly sandstones that grade upwards into mudstone units. Thin, lenticular coal seams appear sporadically across the Tsomo Member. The thickest of the coal seams is the Offa Seam. The sediments of the different Molteno Formation members preserve the different environments in which they were first deposited. The conglomerates and coarser-grained sandstones were deposited in high-energy braided fluvial systems. The more medium to fine-grained sandstones were deposited in mixed load meandering river channels. The mudrocks were deposited in distal floodplain deposits, and the coal seams in localized peat bogs. The Molteno Formation was part of a greater inland basin, which the Gondwanide mountain range bordered in the south. Braided rivers flowed down from the mountains northwards, steadily joining meandering river channels and eventually meeting with floodplains and marshes. These depositional environments each have associated fossil flora and fauna that are unique to them. The fossil flora and fauna co-associations reveal different, distinctive habitats that were present during the time. While the different depositional environments were temperate overall, they experienced extreme seasonal differences. Winters were near-freezing with moderate rainfall, and midsummer temperatures were harsh. The Permo-Triassic extinction event occurred a few million years before the Molteno Formation rock sediments were deposited. However, its lingering effects continued to influence the stability of the earth's climate when the Molteno Formation rocks were deposited.  Paleontology  Ginkgo fossil similar to the fossil ginkgo species found in the Molteno Formation Local and international paleobotanists and entomologists revere the Molteno Formation for its richly diverse plant and insect fossils. The Molteno Formation fossils include 204 plant species and 333 insect species, making it one of the richest Triassic-age plant and insect assemblages ever discovered. Entomologists consider the insect fauna particularly important, because well-preserved fossil remains of insects are very rare. Dicroidium fossil similar to theDicroidium species found in the Molteno Formation The plant and insect fossils had unique ecological co-associations, and occupied distinct habitats. The dominant fossil flora is associated with seven recognized habitat types. The first two habitats include arboreal species of Dicroidium, an extinct genus of seed fern that grew in either lush, riparian forests or more temperate woodlands. Herbaceous forms of Dicroidium are also found but did not dominate. Nineteen species of Dicroidium alone have been recovered from the Molteno Formation.Anderson, H.M. and Anderson, J.M., 1997. Why not look for proangiosperms in the Molteno Formation. In Proceedings 4th European Palaeobotanical and Palynological Conference. Meded. Nederl. Inst. Toegep. Geowetens. TNO (Vol. 58, pp. 73‚Äì80). The next habitat is also temperate woodland, but a different seed fern species dominates it: Sphernobaiera. Another habitat contains thickets of the conifer species Heidiphyllum. Only two other species of conifer are known from the Molteno Formation. Finally, there are Equisetum (horsetail) marshes, comprising 21 species in five genera, and Ginkgophytopsis fern meadows. The seven habitat types contain various cycad species. Cycads were as diverse as the Equisetum but appear to have been far less common, as only a few specimens have been recovered. Lycopods, bryophytes, Ginkgoales, and 50 species of fern have also been found, as well as associated plant frutifications, organs, and pollens. Fossil leaf impressions and other soft vegetative material of these species appear commonly in the low-energy mudstone-rich depositional environments. The vegetative material occurs near to where the plants had originally grown. On the other hand, floods often swept woody material far away from its original habitat. Petrified wood fragments, cones, and other woody material predominantly lie in the high-energy depositional environments dominated by the coarser sandstones. Example of fossil insect species found in the Molteno Formation The Molteno Formation's insects are considered its most important fossils because of their high diversity. The insect fossils include 333 species and 117 genera. Cockroaches are the most commonly found fossil insect. However, beetles are the most rich in species, with 161 species documented. Other insect fossils include dragonflies, dragonfly aquatic nymphs, and clam shrimp species. Insect and other invertebrate trace fossils have been found in the fine sandstones and mudstone deposits. Dinosaur trackways have been found in one locality, however, no vertebrate remains have yet been yielded from the Molteno Formation.  Correlation  The Molteno Formation is currently considered to correlate with parts of the Tuli Basin in the northern parts of South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.

Prentiss first appeared in \\"The Last Word\\" (episode nine of season two), replacing Agent Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), who had quit in \\"The Boogeyman\\". Her role in the show's sixth season was reduced, for what Brewster believed to be financial reasons. Brewster returned to her role for the show's seventh season. Her final episode as a main cast member was the May 16, 2012 episode \\"Run.\\" Brewster reprised the role again in 2014 for the 200th episode. She returned as Prentiss following the departure of co-star Shemar Moore for the season 11 episode \\"Tribute\\". Brewster returned as series regular in season 12. She was brought back soon after co-star Thomas Gibson had been dismissed from the show. Background Prentiss was born on October 12th, 1970 to her unnamed father and Elizabeth, a US Ambassador.\\"Cold Comfort,\\" Season 4 Episode 14 Due to her mother's job postings, Prentiss spent her childhood in numerous places, including Ukraine, France, Italy, and various countries in the Middle East. Her father has never been referred to in any way. She graduated from Chesapeake Bay University with a B.A. in Criminal Justice\\"Annihilator,\\" Season 13 Episode 15 and then from Yale University before joining the FBI, and had worked at its field offices in the Midwest before coming to the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). Prentiss is extremely well travelled due to her upbringing as an ambassador's daughter and her previous assignments while at Interpol. She is fluent in Arabic,\\"Lessons Learned,\\" Season 2 Episode 10 Spanish, French,\\"Lauren\\" Season 6 Episode 18 Italian, Russian (can hold a conversation but is limited), and Greek.\\"Honor Among Thieves,\\" Season 2 Episode 20 Prentiss first appeared in the season two episode \\"The Last Word.\\" Her appearance surprises both SSA Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) and Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), as neither supervisor had signed off on the transfer. Hotchner is immediately suspicious of the new agent, but Prentiss, insisting that her mother had not pulled any strings for her to get the assignment, convinces him to let her join the team on a probationary basis, and eventually proves her competence and gains the team's trust. Prentiss was originally written as a lesbian and had a storyline where she woke up in bed next to a woman, which the creative team and Brewster were on board for, but CBS reportedly nixed the idea. In a 2016 interview, following Brewster's return to the show, she stated that she would still \\"be happy to play Emily as bisexual or gay.\\" Prentiss confided to Unit Chief David Rossi (Joe Mantegna) that she struggled to fit in as a teen, since she moved around so often, and would do \\"almost anything\\" to fit in. She told Rossi that during her mother's diplomatic posting in Italy, she got pregnant at 15 and had an abortion. She also states that the friend who accompanied her to the clinic \\"saved [her] life.\\"\\"Demonology,\\" Season 4 Episode 17 Relationships with colleagues Paget Brewster (third from the right) filming in 2010 Initially upon joining the BAU, Prentiss feels like an outsider and often worries that people doubt her ability as a profiler. Over time, Prentiss proves herself through her sharp profiling skills, competence, and dedication to the work, gradually earning the trust and respect of her fellow BAU team members. Prentiss has a good relationship with her supervisor Aaron Hotchner and establishes herself as one of the most reliable and capable agents on the BAU. Hotchner had previously worked as the Head of Security for Prentiss's Ambassador mother, Elizabeth Prentiss, but did not cross paths with Prentiss, because she was off to Yale. When she joins the BAU, they get off to a rocky start, but after a confrontation in his office about her feelings and opinions regarding politics and after she resigns instead of secretly feeding reports to Section Chief Erin Strauss (Jayne Atkinson), Hotchner begins to understand and trust Prentiss. Before leaving to be with the BAU on a case despite his suspension from the field, Hotchner stops by Prentiss' apartment to convince her to get on the plane with him to help their team catch the UNSUB. In \\"52 Pickup,\\" Hotchner is seen asking Prentiss for advice on how to deal with Agent Jordan Todd (Meta Golding), and acts on her suggestions, even giving Todd another chance to prove herself. For the most part, Prentiss has also developed friendly relationships with the other members of the BAU team. Prentiss immediately bonds with Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) due to their mutual love of Kurt Vonnegut, and they develop a close relationship. Their strong bond is most evident in the episodes leading up to and after Prentiss' faked death. Morgan is able to detect that Prentiss is worried about something and tries to get her to tell him what is bothering her. He also feels betrayed when Prentiss does not reveal the extent of her involvement with Doyle and the case and assumes she does not trust him enough. Rossi later tries to reason with him that Prentiss is merely trying to protect the BAU team. Morgan is also with Prentiss, holding her, when she is dying after being seriously injured by Doyle, and tells her that he understands what she did, and that she is brave, and he is proud of her. When he believes she has died, Morgan takes her death quite hard and expresses anger toward Doyle. When Emily returns to the BAU in season 7, Morgan shows concern for her safety and ability to protect herself in the field by making her sign up for re-certification. Over time, she also forms a close relationship with Agent Jennifer \\"JJ\\" Jareau (A.J. Cook), especially when they are the only two female agents in the BAU in the field for several seasons. When Prentiss has to fake her death for the team's safety, Jareau is the only one (aside from Hotchner) who knows the truth. JJ also flies to Paris and is involved in getting fake passports and setting up bank accounts for Prentiss to stay incognito. Jareau expresses the most happiness when Prentiss came back from the dead and tells Prentiss how much she has missed her while she was gone. In the rare moments outside work, Jareau and Prentiss have been seen having conversations about children and the men, or lack thereof, in Prentiss' life. Prentiss is also the first to congratulate Jareau when she reveals she is pregnant. After Agent Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) returns to work following his abduction by serial killer Tobias Hankel (James Van Der Beek), Prentiss experiences a falling out with the young agent due to his harsh behavior toward her (a function of the irritability resulting from Reid's use of narcotics to cope with his recent trauma). However, the agents eventually gain a mutual respect and even share light-hearted moments. Prentiss sometimes joins in with Morgan in good- naturedly teasing Reid for his social awkwardness. She also amazes Reid when she beats him at poker, which he has never lost at before. Another turning point in their relationship is when Prentiss and Reid are held captive by a cult and Prentiss admits she is an FBI agent, causing her to suffer a beating from the cult's leader, Benjamin Cyrus (Luke Perry). As a result, Reid feels guilty, but Prentiss reassures him everything is all right and that her injuries are not his fault. Prentiss is also the only one Reid tells about his recurring headaches. Reid is one of the most affected by Prentiss' \\"death\\", sobbing on Jareau's shoulder because he never got to say goodbye. Later, when Prentiss comes back, Reid feels betrayed by Prentiss for not telling him the truth, but Prentiss confronts him and they eventually reconcile. Prentiss is often seen hanging out with Jareau and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia outside of work. Garcia looks up to Prentiss and never fails to vocalize her admiration, whether it is for Prentiss' fluency in Arabic, wit or the fact she took up salsa dancing classes. Garcia also notes that after four years with the team, Prentiss is a part of the ‚ÄúBAU family;‚Äù they hold a close friendship. On the job Prentiss is shown to be an extremely competent, level-headed agent. She is not as affected by the nightmares that come with the job and manages to keep her cool in hostile confrontations. She is also shown to put herself in the line of fire, for example, volunteering to enter into the unsub's house to rescue his young son, and sacrifice herself for her teammates, as she does for Reid once in the season 4 episode, \\"Minimal Loss\\". She does not act rashly and there is only one rare occasion where she allows her personal feelings to interfere with investigations. It has been mentioned by Morgan that she has problems trusting others, preferring to handle things independently instead of asking for help, but it is revealed that this reluctance is due to her background as an undercover agent. Ian Doyle and \\"Death\\" In the sixth season, Prentiss is notified by her former superiors at Interpol that arms dealer Ian Doyle (Timothy V. Murphy) has escaped from prison in North Korea. Later, after returning home from work, Prentiss receives several hang-up calls on her home phone from an unknown caller. She then realizes that someone might be watching her, so she sets up noise traps and sits in a chair in front of the door with a gun. Upon her return home on a subsequent night, she finds an anonymous gift on her doorstep, containing a single purple flower. She experiences a flashback to a past undercover job in Italy, during which she was acting as his girlfriend and observing Doyle. Recognizing that the gift of the purple flower means Doyle knows where she lives, Prentiss flees. In \\"Coda,\\" Prentiss enlists two former Interpol colleagues in hunting Doyle. In ‚ÄúValhalla,‚Äù Tsia Mosely (Tsiena Goines), one of her former Interpol colleagues, is shot in the head by Doyle.\\"Valhalla,\\" Season 6 Episode 17 At the end of that episode, Prentiss sneaks out of a meeting in order to save her BAU colleagues from Doyle. At the beginning of \\"Lauren,\\" it is revealed that Prentiss had been a spy eight years previously, on a task force profiling terrorists; while undercover, she met Doyle and became his lover. Her betrayal of Doyle led to his arrest and subsequent imprisonment, including time in a North Korean prison. Prentiss tracks down Doyle in Boston and tries to kill him, but he takes her hostage. Later, Rossi realized that she left their team meeting suddenly in order to protect them from Doyle as it was Prentiss that Doyle was after. Hotchner says they will treat Doyle as an \\"unsub\\" (unidentified subject) and Prentiss as his victim, and profile them just as they would in any other case. They eventually track them down to an abandoned building in Boston and arrive with a SWAT team. Prentiss reveals to Doyle that his son, Declan, whom Doyle believed had been killed, is actually alive, and that she staged photos of executing the boy in order to get Doyle to break under interrogation in North Korea. After an intense fight, Doyle manages to stab Prentiss in the abdomen with a broken table leg. Even though she is dying, she refuses to tell him where his son is hiding, and Doyle escapes shortly before Morgan reaches her. In the hospital, the BAU team is notified that Prentiss has died. They are seen attending her funeral. The last scene, however, reveals she is alive and in Paris, where Jareau meets her and gives her an envelope with \\"passports from three different countries, and a bank account in each one to keep [her] comfortable.\\" Returning to the BAU In the season seven premiere, Morgan captures Doyle, and Prentiss returns to the BAU to assist the team in finding who kidnapped Doyle's son, Declan.\\"It Takes a Village,\\" Season 7 Episode 1 The team comes under fire from the judiciary panel for their retaliatory actions to avenge Prentiss' death, but everyone stands their ground to protect the team. Section Chief Erin Strauss later reveals to them that the committee was persuaded by Prentiss' defense and eventually decided to lift the BAU's suspensions although they will still be \\"keeping a close eye\\" on the members. Reid, who is still angry over her \\"death\\", refuses to speak to her or Jareau, or even look them in the eye. At the end of \\"Proof,\\" Prentiss talks it through with him and they make amends.\\"Proof,\\" Season 7 Episode 2 In the premiere it is also revealed that Garcia has been taking care of her cat, Sergio, and when she inquires about him, Garcia jokingly states that she wants visitation rights. In the season seven finale, Prentiss receives an offer to run Interpol's London office. While still pondering her decision on the offer, Prentiss decides to leave the BAU. In the season eight premiere, Morgan and Garcia mention seeing her while they were in London. Brewster returned for guest appearances in the season 9 episode \\"200\\" in 2014 and the season 11 episode \\"Tribute\\" in early 2016 before returning as a regular cast member in the season 12 episode \\"Taboo\\" later in the year.\\"Taboo,\\" Season 12, Episode 3 In Season 12, Prentiss becomes the Unit Chief of the BAU, following Hotchner's departure.\\"Elliot's Pond,\\" Season 12, Episode 6 References External links Category:Criminal Minds characters Category:Fictional Behavioral Analysis Unit agents Category:Fictional characters from Washington, D.C.

William Linton (17911876) was a British landscape artist. Life and artistic work Born in Liverpool, Linton grew up at Lancaster and Cartmel, and went to school at Windermere where later he spent holidays. At the age of sixteen he was placed in a merchant's office. He however did not like the job. For his own pleasure, he started to copy works by Claude Gellee (Lorrain, 1600‚Äì1682) and Richard Wilson (1714‚Äì1782). Eventually he made art his profession. Linton's later works still bear strong influence of Claude Lorrain's manner with its investigation of natural light effects, of Richard Wilson with his large-scale panoramic compositions, and particularly of Claude-Joseph Vernet (1714‚Äì1789) with his inclination to an idealised classical landscape. By 1817 Linton settled in London and started to exhibit at the Royal Academy and British Institution. Castle Campbell. 1820s. Wolverhampton Art Gallery At that time, his subjects often presented scenery in Scotland and in the North of England, especially in the vicinity of the Lakes. He took an active part in the founding of the Society of British Artists in 1823-1824 and was its President in 1837. In 1828-1829, he undertook a long sketching tour through Italy, travelling from the North to the South coast. On his second, more extended tour, he travelled around the Mediterranean, visiting the South of France, Sicily, Italy, Malta and Greece.Viardot, Louis. A Brief History of the Painters of All Schools.London, 1877. The result of these journeys was a great number of sketches. Albanian Mountains with Corfu in Distance. 1830s These sketches were successful on their own right, but also they formed a basis for his large-scale landscape oil paintings which firmly established his reputation as a leading landscape artist in classical style.

Delos. 1831, from a drawing in the collection of Benjamin Hick Linton's large-scale architectural phantasy 'Delos' (Wolverhampton Art Gallery) was engraved by William Miller in 1831. The contemporaries praised Linton as \\"the new Richard Wilson\\". He was compared with his contemporary J.M.W. Turner.Positano, Gulf of Salerno. 1840s The reviewer of the 1851 exhibition at the Royal Academy wrote about Linton's 'View of Venice': > The real aspect of Venice itself and of the Grand Canal has never been more > faithfully rendered, even by Canaletti (sic!), than by Mr W.Linton. We > admire the breadth, repose, and sobriety of the tone which are so favourable > to architectural effect in his pictures, and Mr Linton never resorts to > those artifices of light by which so many modern artists attempt to throw a > strained and unnatural interest over their compositions.The Times, 7 May > 1851. Linton had wealthy patrons, and his large-scale painting 'Positano, Gulf of Salerno' (Wolverhampton Art Gallery) was commissioned by the Earl of Ellesmere. At the same time, Linton also presented himself as a man-of- letters: in 1832, he published a book ‚ÄòSketches in Italy: being a selection from upwards of five hundred of the most striking and picturesque scenes in various parts of Piedmont: the Milanese, Venetian, and Roman States; Tuscany; and the Kingdom of Naples; sketched during a tour in the years 1828-1829.‚Äô(London,1832). In the same year, he also published Scenery of Greece and its Islands, illustrated by fifty engravings and collaborated with celebrated children writer Mrs Barbara Hofland (1770‚Äì1844) on the book ‚ÄòPoetical illustrations of the various scenes represented in Mr. Linton's \\"Sketches in Italy\\". He was a talented chemist and published in 1852 the Ancient and Modern Colours, from the Earliest Periods to the Present Time, with their Chemical and Artistical Properties. In 1831, he married Julia Adelina Swettenham (1806‚Äì1867), a niece to the Countess of Winterton.The Annual Register, Vol.73, 1832; The Gentleman Magazine, Vol.150, 1831.

As a result, Weiser, along with his countrymen, became known as the German Palatines. Ultimately, they settled in the Colony of New York where Weiser became a leader in the Palatine community and was founder of their settlement of Weiser's Dorf, now known as Middleburgh, New York. When the Germans were in dispute with their English landlords and the colonial government of New York, he was among the representatives chosen to go to London and seek help from the British government. This contributed to the downfall of the governorship of New York's colonial governor, Robert Hunter. Biography Early life Johann Conrad Weiser was born in 1662 in Gro√üaspach, W√ºrttemberg, Holy Roman Empire to Jacob Weiser, an innkeeper, and his wife, Anna Trefz. Weiser married Anna Magdalena Uebele and they had a total of fifteen children. He served as a corporal in the army of the Holy Roman Empire, and fought in the Nine Years' War of 1688 to 1697 between a coalition of European powers and France. He was a member of the W√ºrttemberg Blue Dragoons, and was stationed at Affst√§tt, Herrenberg, W√ºrttemberg in the 1690s. Soon after the birth of Conrad Jr., the Weisers moved back to their ancestral home of Gro√üspach. Afterwards, he followed the trade of a baker. Immigration Weiser and his family were German Palatines who fled Germany because of the destruction of crops by invading French armies, and the icy cold winter of 1708‚Äî09; Weiser's wife Anna Magdeleana died suddenly of an attack of the gout while pregnant with their fifteenth child on May 1, 1709. On June 24, 1709, Weiser and eight children, moved away from Gro√üaspach. His married daughter, Catrina, stayed behind with her husband, Conrad Boss and two children. Weiser sold his house, fields, meadows, vineyard, and garden to Conrad and Catrina, for 75 gulden. The Weisers, along with over 15,000 other Palatines, left their homeland and traveled west to the Rhine River, and then down the Rhine into the Netherlands. As the number of German refugees increased, the Dutch decided to send them to England. In late summer 1709, the Weisers arrived in London, along with thousands of other Germans. Queen Anne of Great Britain was sympathetic toward the German Palatines, and allowed them to stay in England. However, as their numbers grew, the Board of Trade and Plantations prepared a plan to send them to America, where the Crown promised them free land after they worked off their passage by producing naval stores. The Weisers remained in England for a few months. They left England December 1709 on the Lyon, one of ten ships carrying about 3,000 people to America, including Weiser and his family. The Lyon arrived in New York on June 13, 1710. After being held in quarantine to let ship diseases run their course, the surviving refugees were taken up the Hudson River to Livingstone's manor. Life in the New York colony Historical marker in Middleburgh, New York noting the settlement of Weiser's Dorf. Despite being promised free land, the Germans were required to work for several years to pay for their transportation expenses. The Germans were also forced to pay rent for their property. The Germans were divided into five camps, and Weiser was appointed to be in charge of one. The Germans were to produce tar from the trees, but they were unsuitable. Weiser took the Germans' complaints to Robert Hunter, the colonial governor of New York. In 1711, the English conscripted German Palatines to fight the French in northern New York. Weiser served as a captain in one of the Palatine contingents. Upon their return, the Palatines discovered that their families had nearly starved in their absence. Again, Weiser led the Palatines in complaining to Governor Hunter. In 1711, Weiser remarried to Anna Margaretha M√ºller. His children disapproved of the marriage, and Conrad Jr. wrote, \\"It was an unhappy match, and was the cause of my brothers and sisters' all becoming scattered.\\" In the fall of 1713, Weiser and his family reached Schenectady. They stayed at the home of John Meyndert during the winter of 1713-14. The Mohawk, part of the Iroquois Confederacy, helped the German Palatines throughout the winter, in which they earned their trust. After negotiating with the Mohawk, the Germans were given permission to move further west in the valley. In the spring of 1714, with the help of Mohawk Indians, Weiser led his family, along with about 150 other families to Schoharie, located west of Albany. At this time, a Maqua chief visited Weiser, and suggested that his son, the younger Conrad, go with him and learn the Maqua language, and he did. The Germans who settled here were very poor to start out with. At Schoharie, they grew corn, potatoes, and ground beans to get through the following year. Life was harsh, and families sometimes went two or three days without food. Eventually, multiple villages in the area sprang up, more food was grown, and thus life improved and people no longer starved. But, despite the fact that Hunter had let the Germans go free, he threatened the Germans not to move to Schoharie, or he would see it as rebellion. The government of New York was displeased with the Germans, despite having left New York. In 1715, Hunter sent an agent, Adam Vrooman, to Schoharie, to make deeds for the Palatines, although the Mohawk had granted them the land. The Palatines were resistant, and the land that the Germans had settled on in Schoharie was taken away and granted by Hunter to seven landlords. The German deputies were stripped of their titles, and the promise of free land by Queen Anne was ignored. Hunter authorized a warrant for Weiser's arrest, after Vrooman complained of mistreatment while in Schoharie, but Weiser escaped. This brought an uproar, and the Germans rebelled. They drove out the sheriff who was sent from Albany, and became increasingly hostile to the government. Commissioner to London After five years of hostility between the Germans and the New York government, the German Palatines decided to send representatives to appeal to the Board of Trade in London. The community sent three men to represent them: Johann Conrad Weiser, Wilhelm Scheff, and Gerhardt Walrath. Hunter and his allies worked on a compromise to prevent the men from leaving. Because Hunter had threatened to arrest Weiser, the three commissioners decided to leave from Philadelphia instead of New York. They departed the city in 1718, but fell into the hands of pirates in the Delaware Bay. They lost their personal money, but not that of the colony. They were released and left without money and suitable clothing. The ship stopped at Boston for more supplies. The commissioners finally arrived in London and found that Queen Anne had died. The new monarch, King George I, was not interested in their case. Hunter had sent agents to England, who portrayed the Germans as rebels and enemies to the Crown. Progress was slow for the representatives. During this time, Walrath grew tired of waiting and embarked for home, but died at sea. Later, Weiser and Scheff were imprisoned for debt. They wrote for help, but their letters were intercepted. Finally, word reached Schoharie and the community collected money for their redemption. After months of waiting, their debts were paid. In July 1720, Weiser and Scheff petitioned to the Board of Trade. By this time, Hunter had resigned as governor and took a position in Jamaica. The newly commissioned Governor of New York, William Burnet, was ordered to grant land to the Germans. In 1723 he completed what was called the Burnetsfield Patent, whereby 100 heads of families received about each on the north and south sides of the Mohawk River west of present-day Little Falls. Weiser and Scheff were dissatisfied and had a falling out in 1721. Refusing to follow Weiser, Scheff returned home but died six months later. Weiser returned to North America in 1723. He decided to migrate to the colony of Pennsylvania. Later life and death In 1723, William Keith, Baronet Governor of Pennsylvania, was in Albany on business when he heard about the suffering of the Germans in New York. He invited them to the colony of Pennsylvania. With the help of the Mohawk, Weiser led a group of Germans from Schoharie south to the Susquehanna River; they traveled along Indian paths and by canoe to present-day Tulpehocken in the spring of 1723. Weiser was unhappy with many of his fellow Germans, and returned to New York a few years later. He wandered around New York for several years. Conrad Jr. brought him to the home of his grandsons in Pennsylvania in May 1746, where he died soon after. Family Conrad Weiser the Younger Children Johann Conrad Weiser and Anna Magdalena Ubelin had 16 children, of which 13 are known: Maria Catharine Weiser (who married Conrad Boss and remained in Gro√üaspach); Anna Margarete Weiser; Anna Magdalena Weiser (who married Jan Johannes De Lange); Maria Sabina Weiser; Johann Conrad Weiser Jr. (who became a pioneer, interpreter, and diplomat in Pennsylvania); George Frederick Weiser; Christopher Frederick Weiser; and Anna Barbara Weiser (who married Nicholas Pickard). John Frederick Weiser, Rebecca Weiser), John Frederick Weiser (later children were frequently named after one who had died), Erhard Frederick Weiser, and Rebecca Weiser all died young, the second John Frederick while the family was at the work camp at Livingston Manor.

From 1994 to 1998, he worked with the Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR). While he was in the UK, he worked with the British Agencies Afghanistan Group from 1999 until 2001 and British Overseas NGOs for Development from 2001 until 2003. Ludin's political career started in November 2001 when he took part in organization of the United Nations-sponsored Bonn Conference that laid out the democratic framework for the post-Taliban Afghanistan. In early 2003, he gave up his doctorate studies at the University of London and returned to Afghanistan to take up his first political post as Presidential Spokesman and Director of Communications for President Hamid Karzai's government. He also was spokesperson of Karzai during the 2004 presidential election campaign On June 29, 2005, Ludin was appointed Chief of Staff of President Hamid Karzai, with responsibility for overall management of the President's Office and its various organs, and remained in that post until January 2007 when he was replaced by Omar Daudzai. The replacement came as Karzai was criticised for not taking strong action against corruption and drug trafficking. The resignation of Ludin was due to political infighting within Karzai's government said senior officials.The Telegraph: Power struggle forces out Afghan chief of staff Much of the blame for Karzai's poor performance has been blamed by Afghans on his staff and cabinet ministers and Ludin appears to have become a victim of the blame game.Ohmy News: Karzai Removes His Chief of Staff According to The Times Ludin was forced to resign after attempts to defend Britain led to accusations that he was a British spy. Some of Karzai's closest advisers had accused Britain of conspiring with Pakistan to hand over southern Afghanistan.The Times: Karzai bids for peace in furore with London Ludin submitted his resignation after Karzai had accused Ludin and Afghan Education Minister Hanif Atmar, who both had studied in Britain, of conspiring against him, although Karzai apologized later.New York Times: Karzai in His Labyrinth After his resignation, first there was speculation that Ludin would be appointed Ambassador to Egypt, but instead he was appointed as the Ambassador of Afghanistan to Norway, also accredited to Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. On June 3, 2009, Ludin replaced Omar Samad as the Ambassador of Afghanistan to Canada. It is reported that in December 2010 Ludin resigned as ambassador of Canada and went back to Afghanistan.Ottow Citizen: Honduras striving to reduce violence Academic life Ludin has written extensively on Afghanistan, the region as well as on conflict and development issues, including co-authoring a book on conflict management strategies (Zed Books UK, 2002) and articles and commentary in international publications, notably the Guardian in the UK.https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jawed-ludin Ludin is fluent in Pashto, Persian and English, and also speaks some French and Hindi.

In an interview in 2003 he called his work for the Afghan government his \\"reason for existence,\\" \\"Somehow I am being useful in my own little corner. I can have a meaningful life in London, but there is no way I can get rid of being an Afghan.\\"Telegraph:Young Afghans return to lead the renaissance of the land their parents fled Political views Northern alliance During the beginning of the War in Afghanistan in 2001, in a series of opinion articles in The Guardian Ludin was critical of the Northern Alliance, stating that it's hard to imagine that the Northern Alliance can be trusted to deliver the country to peace. He stressed the need for the UK and the USA to focus on a political strategy, and not only a military strategy. At that time he called a leadership under the former king, Zahir Shah, promising option.The Guardian: My country, post Taliban A few laters, when he was President Karzai's chief of staff, Ludin defended the appointment of 13 warlords in high positions in the Afghan police: \\"This is not rearming militias. We would like to strengthen the police presence in districts in the south where there has been a rise in terrorism. Building institutions should not be seen as sidelining any sector of society, especially the mujahideen,\\" he said.Guardian: UN report accuses Afghan MPs of torture and massacresCS Monitor: Karzai taps tribal fighters as police Pakistan As spokesperson of Karzai he urged Pakistan to do more about Taliban and terrorist in the Afghan Pakistan border regionAsia Times: Why the US needs the TalibanDaily Star: Pak FM in Kabul for talks on volatile border, tradeThe Island Packet: Pakistan urged to further combat insurgents and criticised the Pakistani government of be√Øng soft on terrorism.Pakistan Criticized For Being 'soft' On MilitantsTimes Daily: Afghan Caution against 'soft' line on militants In the months before the 2005 Parliamentary elections, he warned that the Taliban and Al Qaeda have chosen this time to set a plot in motion and he called for cooperation from Afghanistan's neighborsAl Qaeda behind Afghan violence, officials say \\"Foreign enemies have been creating problems for Afghanistan over the past 30 years and terrorists come from across the border,\\" said Ludin a week later.Afghan gov't blames foreign hands behind Kandahar blast On 23 June 2005, following the arrest of three Pakistani's suspected of planning to murder US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, Ludin attacked Pakistan for not helping enough with the fight against terrorism. He said the plot is just one example of recent violence by Pakistanis or Arab foreigners within Afghanistan.Raio Free Europe: Surge In Violence Raises Concerns Ahead Of Afghan Elections Militants involved in the current battle were trained at camps in Pakistan, Ludin claimed. He demanded immediate action from Islamabad against key leaders of the ousted Taliban regime sheltering in Pakistan and demanded that Pakistan close off its border to prevent the routed militants from fleeing back to a safe haven in Pakistan once again.Radio Free Europe: Afghanistan: Kabul Tells Pakistan To Do More As Battle With Taliban Rages Near Border A few hours later Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf telephoned his Karzai to defuse tensions.Forbes: Pakistan, Afghan presidents talk as tensions rise over Taliban attacks In May 2006 Ludin repeated his allegations. He accused the Pakistani security forces of allowing militants to operate openly in cities such as Quetta, Karachi and Peshawar, as well as the tribal territories. \\"We have evidence that suicide bombings, roadside bombs and other terrorist actions taking place in Afghanistan emanate from Pakistan and that some Pakistani circles actually provide support for these activities,\\" Ludin said.Times Sunday Times: Allies feud over mutual enemy When the Indian engineer Suryanarayan was killed, Ludin said \\"There are common enemies who India and Afghanistan have who do not want India here.BBC: Body of Indian hostage flown home And when a Taliban commander claimed that the Pakistani secret service ISI had a hand in the killing of Suryanarayan, Ludin was quick to ask an explanation from Islamabad.Gulf Times: ISI accused of ordering killing of engineer in Afghanistan In 2007 Ludin said again that Afghanistan had long maintained that the Islamic militants operated from within Pakistan.BBC: Al-Qaeda 'rebuilding' in Pakistan While being Ambassador in the Nordic countries, Lundin wrote an opinion article in the Guardian in 2008 titled \\"Take this war into Pakistan.\\" In this article Ludin states that the army of Pakistan has sought to undermine the international effort to stabilise Afghanistan and that it is in Pakistan that terrorism must be defeated. A supreme commander should be appointed to devise and implement an effective counter-terrorism strategy for operations on both sides of the Durand line that separates the two countries.Jawed Ludin in The Guardian: Take this war into Pakistan Towards Iran Ludin has been more kindly in his words. In an article about Iran seeking more influence in Afghanistan Ludin said: \\"History may prove that overly optimistic, but it is in our interests today to trust our Iranian neighbors and expect the same in return.\\"New York Times: Iran Is Seeking More Influence in Afghanistan Taliban According to Ludin the Karzai government was willing to let former Taliban members play a role in post-war Afghanistan, unless they have blood on their hands. In that case they will be captured as terrorists. But Ludin said that no more than 100 Taliban members worked as terrorist with Al Qaida, and that the Taliban no longer existed as a movement.Institute for War and Peace Reporting: Taleban Officials Come to the Table \\"People associated with the former Communist regime are back. So are former mujahideen,\\" said Ludin \\"Therefore, nothing should really stop the Taliban rank and file from taking part in the national life of the country.\\"Christian Science Monitor: Weary Taliban coming in from the cold When Russia said the dividing into 'good' and 'bad' Taliban factions was unacceptable for them, Ludin responded moderate, saying he was hoping that Moskow would clarify its official position.Eurasianet: Afghanistan: Was Taliban Involved In Uzbek Violence? Ludin stated in June 2005 that the terrorist threat in Afghanistan was fragile: \\"(The guerrillas) are very small compared with the increasing capability of our own forces, compared with the combined capability of the international community that's there to help us and compared to the will of the Afghan people.\\"The Star: Bombs kill senior Afghan policeman and four others In the end of 2009 Ludin stated as Ambassador to Canada that it is \\"very realistic\\" to expect a military victory over the Taliban by 2011 when the United States troops pull out of Afghanistan.CRI English: Victory over Taliban by 2011 Possible: Afghan Diplomat But that will depend on how many resources to be put in training the Afghan national forces and preparing the Afghan institutions, he added. Warlords As spokesperson of President Karzai, Ludin repeatedly warned Afghan warlords that they will be facing sanctions they don't co-operate with the central government. In March 2004 Ludin announced the resignation of Afghan Planning Minister Mohammad Mohaqeq. He claimed that Mohaqeq expressed his desire to be out of the cabinet, but according to Mohaqeq he was illegally dismissed by president Karzai.Radio Free Europe: Dispute Erupts Over Afghan Minister's Purported Resignation In April 2004 Ludin said strong words to another important Afghan ethnic leader, Abdul Rashid Dostum. Ludin warned Dostum that, although Dostum was a Karzai adviser, if government investigation showed Dostum had anything to do with the uprising against Faryab Governor Anayatullah Anayat it would be deemed as an unlawful act.Radio Free Europe: Afghanistan: Battles Highlight Struggle Between Warlords, Central Government/09/afghanistan.jamesastill Guardian:Civil war fear as Afghan city falls to warlord However, Ludin wasn't willing to speculate on any action against Dostum.Boston World News: Afghan warlord calls for firings Also other militia leaders who are not working with the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration programme will be brought to Justice, said Ludin. In July 2004, when army commanders Ata Mohammad, Hazrat Ali and Khan Mohammed Khan were placed in civilian and police post it was, according to Ludin, to ensure that the upcoming presidential election was conducted freely and fairly, though the replacements were a result of careful negotiations.Radio Free Euope: Afghan Leader Shuffles CommandersRadio Free Europe: Afghanistan: Karzai Removes Militia Leaders From Military Posts In August 2004 he spoke strong words when warlord Amanullah Khan (militia leader) fought his way to within sight of the outskirts of Herat, against troops of Herat Governor Ismail Khan: \\"whoever is responsible for this breakdown and breach of security will be brought to justice,\\" Ludin said.The Star: Rebel Afghan commander advances to within sight of regional capital When in December 2004 president Kaarzai appointed a new cabinet and ousted some high-profile warlords like Mohammed Fahim, Sayed Hussain Anwari and Gul Agha Sherzai, Ludin said this takes Afghanistan to a new era in which people come to the Cabinet because they are capable of serving the Afghan people and because they are educated.USA Today: Afghanistan's new cabinet sworn in But when controversial Afghan warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum was given a post within the government as Chief of Staff of the High Command of the Armed Forces, Ludin called this \\"a good thing, a positive one.\\"Daily Times: R E G I O N: Karzai picks Dostam to command army On allegations of war crimes of Dostum Ludin said: \\"Let's not talk about that because that's a completely different issue.\\"Guardian: Warlord brought into Afghan government Corruption Also on corruption, Ludin has taken a tough stand.

Aides When a few months later Timoor Shah claimed he killed another hostage, Clementina Cantoni, because the government didn't meet his demands, Ludin dismissed the claim saying: \\"He is lying. He makes such comments in order to put pressure on the government.\\"The Sunday Times: Kidnapper claims he has killed woman hostage Three weeks later it turned out Ludin was right, when Cantoni was released by the criminal gang who captured her. Drugs As spokesperson Ludin said that the drug war was a top priority for the government, \\"perhaps more important than terrorism,\\" but that he opposed aerial spraying of poppy fields by troops of the international community.Daily Times: Afghans committed to drug war but against spraying In May 2005 US Officials warned that the American financed poppy eradication program was ineffective, in part because Karzai was unwilling to assert strong leadership. Ludin responded that any progress in reducing poppy cultivation was a result of Karzais efforts and that foreign donors had failed to follow up on promises with helping Afghan farmers to find other sources of income.The Tuscaloosa News: Karzai faulted in Heroin fight When Afghan Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali resigned from his post, Ludin denied rumours that it was because he had disagreements with President Karzai about fighting narcotics.Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Afghan Interior Minister resigns from Cabinet US Ludin also expressed concern over the condition of Afghan prisoners in the prisons of the coalition forces.Press selection list for Afghan newspapers (287): 15 Dec 04 When in June 2005 17 Afghan civilians died in a U.S. airstrike, Ludin criticised US behaviour a rare rebuff: \\"There is no way the killing of civilians can be justified.

They did nothing to stop drug production and they hired militias who perpetuated a lot of atrocities.\\" In 2010 his support for Karzai became even less strong. In reactions to question if it was correct that Karzai had stated that if foreign pressure on him continues, Karzai could ally himself with the Taliban, Ludin dismissed this but added: \\"Even if he said something like that, it would be just a turn of phrase. And I know him; he has some turns of phrase\\"The Globe And Mail: Loose talk threatens freedom In the end of 2010 WikiLeaks revealed that William Crosbie, Canada's ambassador to Afghanistan, had strongly criticised Karzai in front of his US colleague. Ludin said this should not affect relations between the two countries: \\"Relations between Canada and Afghanistan go beyond people. Diplomats in Kabul quite often have fallen in traps of some common misperceptions\\"CBC: Canada-Afghan relations safe: Afghan envoy On Canadian television he added: \\"Canada has done so much for this country and that shouldn't be jeopardized by the reckless comments of an ambassador.\\"CTV Edmonton: 'Reckless' comments shouldn't hurt relations: envoy Cluster bombs As ambassador to Norway Ludin helped persuade his government to change its stance and join nearly 100 nations in signing a treaty Wednesday banning the disputed weapons. Afghanistan was initially reluctant to join the pact but agreed to after lobbying by victims maimed by cluster munitions. After speaking with Soraj Ghulan Habib, a 17-year-old wheelchair-bound Afghan who was crippled by a cluster bomb, Ludin called Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who agreed to change his stance on the treaty. Ludin said his country's reversal was made possible by an article in the treaty that permits signatory nations to engage in military operations with nonsignatory nations like the United States.New York Times: Afghanistan says it will sign cluster bomb treaty Canadian effort in Afghanistan In an interview with the Canwest News Service in 2009, Ludin said the international community should not be frustrated by the pace of progress in Afghanistan because his country has made significant gains in the eight years since the fall of its Taliban rulers despite the Western shortfalls in troops and meeting financial aid commitments. Ludin also expressed hope that Canada would still make a military contribution to his country after the 2011 deadline for withdrawal from Kandahar. Ludin said his country is deeply grateful for Canada's military sacrifice \\"really a heavy cost with lives.\\"National Post: Afghanistan‚Äôs new ambassador hopeful for military progress\\" After Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff he suggested that Canadian aid money shouldn't be going to \\"crooks\\" or \\"warlords\\" running Afghanistan's government Ludin issued a statement rebuking Ignatieff for his \\"unjustified\\" characterization of the Afghan government as corrupt and illegitimate. Ludin said Ignatieff's blanket criticism is unfair to the \\"many selfless, dedicated Afghans in the government\\" and added that 80 per cent of all foreign aid in Afghanistan is spent directly by donor-nations, bypassing the Afghan government altogether. In April 2010 Ludin said at an Afghan Canadian political panel: When things go rough, \\"the critical thing, the honourable thing, is to stay committed.\\" Yes, he conceded, Canada has suffered, but you can't leave because things have got hard. \\"Canada has been a friend to Afghanistan in good times; we need Canada to be a friend in bad times.\\".Potter in Macleans: Our Afghan comrades speak out Around the same time Ludin said that Canada's continued discussion of the treatment of Afghan detainees is a waste of time. Ludin said that security forces in his country has come a long way in recent years and that \\"the positive steps are being overshadowed by a debate that makes them look like a bunch of torturers,\\" but that \\"if there weren't any problems in Afghanistan, if there wasn't human-rights violations, if our police and prisons were perfect, why did we need your help?\\".Canada.com Afghan ambassador calls focus on detainees 'terrible waste of time' In the same interview Ludin said that Afghans would accept an end to Canada's combat mission but leaving entirely would baffle them. \\"We would like to believe that you are really serious about success in Afghanistan, that this wasn't just an exercise for your military to get some experience on the battlefield. We would like to believe you were actually there for us, which I believe is the case,\\" he said. \\"It's a bit difficult to understand why some people now question whether you should be there. It's a bit of an insult, to be honest, to all the sacrifices that have been made.\\" In May 2010 Ludin warned that Afghanistan without western aid and military assistance could be more dangerous than just a failed state. \\"Not succeeding in Afghanistan is going to strengthen the forces opposing us in ways you cannot imagine. The war in Afghanistan is a war against a new enemy and if you don't fight it in Afghanistan you will fight it on your own doorstep.\\"Toronto Sun: Afghanistan needs Canada: ambassador Therefore, Ludin asked Canada to stay active in Afghanistan to help build op the Afghan forces before the international troops leave in 2014. If you're asking whether today we would be able to take over responsibility for our own security, I would say no. But that's exactly why yesterday's decision was essentially a timeframe, 2014, and I'm confident it's a doable timeframe,\\" Ludin told CTV's Canada AM.CTV Edmonton: Ambassador hopeful for independent Afghan army by 2014 After the Canadian government said it was sending 1.000 Canadian troops into Afghanistan after their combat mission ends in 2011, Ludin said: \\"This is extremely welcome news for Afghanistan and very much in line with what my country needs at the present juncture.\\"Toronto Sun: Our troops will not see combat past 2011: Gov't Afghan presidential elections Two weeks after the Afghan Presidential Election of August 2009, Ludin wrote an article in The Toronto Star In defence of the Afghan Elections.Jawed Ludin in The Star: In defence of the Afghan election Ludin wrote \\"Like most Afghans, I did not expect a perfect election but I am very worried now about the growing negative, somewhat dismissive, tone of the post-election evaluations. The post-election negativity is casting a long shadow over a landmark day that otherwise would have counted as a major historical achievement for the country.\\" Ludin wrote that the fact the election campaign was not primarily ethnic-based but also issue-based was a sign of the emergence of a modern political culture. The right response would be, according to Ludin, to maintain confidence in the integrity of the institutions in Afghanistan and support wholeheartedly whoever becomes the next president of Afghanistan. Later, Ludin claimed that the extent of fraud was exaggerated by the media and defended Karzai who was accused of stuffing ballots.Canada Est: Afghan ambassador chastises election critics Ludin said he personally witnessed stuffed ballot boxes during Afghanistan's parliamentary elections in 2005. \\"It was in our interest (then) to move on because the important thing was to maintain the integrity of the whole process and if there were problems, they were understandable. Now, for some reason, this time there was not much of an understanding for our problems,\\"The Toronto Sun: Afghan run-off election may see fraud again: ambassador When two months it looked like there would be a run-off election, Ludin asked the international media to expect fraud againWinnigpeg Sun: Expect Afghan vote fraud but nevertheless support the effort, saying the process may not be up to Western standards, but it is the best Afghanistan can do. He dismissed a third election-round or a coalition- government as illegal.CBC News: Karzai rival predicts more voters in Afghan run-off Ludin suggested that if one candidate stepped down, he could find himself with a job in a future government. But he stressed that didn't mean a coalition government had been formed. The editorial of the Toronto Sun attacked Ludin for his statements that it was na√Øve to expect fair elections in Afghanistan.Toronto Sun: Afghans must do more Eventually the situation ended with one of the candidates, Abdullah Abdullah stepping down, resulting in a second term for incumbent president Hamid Karzai.

The history of this style is unclear, but there are two likely sources for this style: #The name Kunlun Mountain Fist may be a reference to the Kunlun mountain range, which is associated with Daoism. #The name Kunlun Mountain Fist may be a reference to Kunlun Mountain in Shandong Province. As more information about this style becomes available, this is becoming the more likely source. For example, one of the forms is called \\"White Cloud Mountain Fist.\\" White Cloud Mountain is in Shandong province. Also, several of the forms are almost identical to the forms in Kunlunquan, which is also from Shandong province. Forms Empty Handed Forms: *Green Dragon Form, White Tiger Form, Red Phoenix Form, Black Tortoise/Snake Form (Similar to Kunlunquan's Four Images/Four Directions Form) *White Crane Form (Similar to Kunlunquan's Five Transitions Form) *White Ape Form (Similar to Kunlunquan's Seventy Two Hammers Form) *White Snake Form *Seven Star Eight Step Form Weapons Forms: *White Crane Saber (Similar to Kunlunquan's White Crane Saber Form) *Seven Stars Straight Sword (Similar to Kunlunquan's Seven Stars Bagua Straight Sword Form) *White Snake Straight Sword Teachers There are no public teachers in North America or Europe. Shifu Jason Baaht taught this style along with Wudang styles in Indianapolis, but he died in 1997 and left no clear successor. Jason Baaht (Ba Yexing)'s senior disciple was named Damien Baaht (Ba Demen). Both names are Taoist names. Jason Baaht was of Hakka Chinese descent, and Damien Baaht was an Englishman. Related Styles Due to the similarities between the forms in this system and those of Kunlunquan, it has been suggested that one style is an offshoot or variation of the other. All the Kunlun Mountain Fist forms fit into the category of the Daoist martial arts, and some of the Kunlunquan forms seem to belong to the Southern Hakka styles, so it has been argued that Kunlunquan is a hybrid of the Kunlun Mountain Fist, but there is no consensus at this time.

This expert system was developed for the Baltimore County Police Department by the Jefferson Institute for Justice Studies to assist the investigation of residential burglaries in the late 1980s. The REBES computer program was discontinued after experimental use in the beginning 1990s.  Beginnings  Criminal investigation commonly differentiates between major crime, e.g. murder and armed robbery, and volume crime, e.g. burglary and shop-lifting. In the United States, the use of artificial intelligence in form of expert systems for crime investigation was primarily driven by the FBI in the 1980s. This software was dedicated to major crimes. The research of an expert system for burglaries began in the United Kingdom. Following the Exeter developed pilot system in 1985, the Devon and Cornwall constabulary expert system investigating domestic burglary offenses, research grants were set up in the United States in 1986 to test expert systems. Securing the grant, the Jefferson Institute for Justice Studies developed further the Devon and Cornwall constabulary system for the Police Department of Baltimore, Maryland.  Summary system definition  Residential burglary is a volume crime with a large number of offenses, often serial offenders and a relatively low detection rate. An experienced police officer working decades in burglaries is more likely to solve a burglary by combining the knowledge of previous cases. It was believed in the 1980s that the brain drain by the retirement of experienced officers may be mitigated by computer programs. As an expert system, REBES was designed to combine human expertise Punch (PUNCH) Paul Montana used \\"REBES\\" studied all his past burglaries in order to solve new burglary cases. Its aimed performance was to solve a burglary by entering the data of the crime scene into REBES so that the program would compare the found behavioral fingerprint with those behavioral fingerprints of known perpetrators as previously stored in the software. It then would provide the identity of the potential offender together with a probability factor. In case of several possibilities, the program would deliver a list of offenders, listed in the order of probability.  Development  The system development took 14 months. Core of the software was the knowledge accumulated by officers of the Baltimore County Police Department in burglary cases. The system architecture of REBES was rule based. The knowledge was represented in \\"if/then\\" types of rules using a heuristic approach.Cf. The main stages of system development comprised the rule definition phase, the phase when data collection forms were designed and lastly the database building phase. During the rule definition phase police officers of the burglary squad gathered the categories characterizing a burglary. These were then formulated as \\"if/then\\" rules and scrutinized by other investigators. This approach was generally used to simulate the human reasoning process. After eliminating non- or little approved rules, the remaining rules were assigned a probability. At a last stage only those rules pertaining to the identification of the probable offender were retained. These rules formed the rule base of REBES. After defining the necessary data collection forms, information of approximately 3,000 solved and 1,700 unsolved cases was entered, containing information about 675 suspected or known burglars. In April 1988 the system was completed to be tested.  Experimental use  During the experimental period (1988‚Äì1990) the average use was 100 queries per month. In most cases, investigators had a suspect and only used the system to provide a list of suspects as a backup. REBES was transferred to the police departments of Rochester (New York), Tucson (Arizona), Charlotte (North Carolina) and Tampa (Florida). Even if, according to its developer, E. C. Ratledge, the detection rate of residential burglaries in Baltimore increased by 2.5% due to REBES,Cited by the system use was discontinued.  Deficiencies of the system and subsequent criticism  Two main criticisms were directed against REBES. The first criticism relates to the system itself. The second criticism was directed against the general, systematic bias of the early expert systems in criminal investigation.  Deficiencies  There has been early credit for REBES; the system's experimental use was acclaimed to be especially a guidance to young officers. However, according to Richard W. Adderley the use was discontinued because of the following factors: \\"Reasons given include high turnover in users, new users disagreeing with the knowledge it contained, the volatility of the knowledge used [... and] the lack of integration with existing computer systems.\\" Particularly strong criticism was voiced by the German communication scientist Jo Reichertz. First, he opposed the hypothesis of the developers of REBES that the system may serve as an example to other target crimes as burglaries are particularly easy to solve for investigators due to the perseverance degree that is shown by offenders. Second, he opposed the forensic approach as being simplistic. The deficiencies of the early expert systems in law enforcement Generally, the early 'expert systems' of the 1980s and 1990s were 'amateur systems' and prototypes. In order to simulate the human reasoning process, simplistic heuristics were used to re-formulate the investigative approach into programmed processes. For Jo Reichertz, the approach by the REBES developers misunderstood the cognitive methods used by burglary experts. Good investigation uses abduction than mere induction but the early expert systems could only produce results based on the entered data (knowledge base) and could not generate 'ideas' nor 'hypotheses'. The deficiencies of the early expert systems in law enforcement were one of the reasons that the main applications of AI in law enforcement are databases.

Identification  The damselfly has a blue and black abdomen, usually with more black than blue. The black humeral stripes are about a half the width of the blue antehumerals. The tule bluet postocular spots are small and triangular; they are separated by a thin occipital bar.  Size  This bluet is long.  Distribution  The tule bluet is found throughout the United States, except for the southeastern quarter and many portions of southern Canada.  Habitat  The following is the list of habitats of the tule bluet. *rivers *lakes *ponds *marshes *bogs They occur where there are bulrushes around.  Flight season  Mid-May to mid-September. It can also be during early July to mid-October.  Diet  *Nymphs: nymphs eat a large variety of aquatic insects, they include mosquito larvae, mayfly larvae, and other aquatic insect larvae. *Adults: adult tule bluet feed on a wide variety small flying insects, mayflies, flies, small moths, and mosquitoes. They sometimes pick up small insects from plants like aphids.  Ecology  The tule bluet is found almost always where there are extensive stands of tules. This is how this bluet gets its common name. The damselfly will emerge from relatively deep water if there are bulrushes nearby. The tule bluet can be also found in alkaline or salty water.  Reproduction  The male damselflies set up territories at choice breeding sites. After males and females have mated, the male stays attached to the female, as she oviposits in the stems of bulrushes. They are in their tandem position.  Conservation  The populations of the tule bluet are widespeard, abundant, and secure.

Prateek ( ) (born September 24, 1954) is a communist politician and one of the senior most leaders of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). He currently holds the rank of senior leader in the politburo of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the largest political party in Nepal, according to the results of the 2008 election. As a revolutionary communist party, the UCPN(M) waged the \\"Nepalese People's War\\" in 1996 regime of Shah Dynasty of Nepal under the framework of constitutional monarchy. And, with the rise of People's War and the gaining of popularity of its agendas among the Nepalese Mass, the UCPN(M) along with other political parties of Nepal was successful overthrowing the 238-year-old Monarchy with the Federal Democratic Republic. The Nepalese Civil War from 1994-2005 resulted in death of more than 19000 Nepali people. In addition, an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people were internally displaced as a result of the conflict. Early life and education Kandel was born in a village named Biukot of Baglung district in the western region of Nepal. His was a family of traditional Brahman values and his ancestors had the history of serving as the respected Purohits (priests) in the society. But he never liked the idea of Brahman dominated society. He finished his secondary education from Amar Jyoti Secondary School, Biukot, Baglung. And, later moved to the capital city Kathmandu for his higher education. He passed his Intermediate in Science from Tribhuwan University and joined the Bachelor of Science in Physics. He later served as the Principal of the same secondary school from where he had completed his secondary education. Political career He cultivated the true revolutionary and communist character since his early childhood. He started his political career from the student front in Patan Campus where he was elected Chairman of the Free Students Union. During his college life in Kathmandu, he shared the same room with Mr.Puspa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), incumbent Chairman of UCPN (M), and they were actively involved in the student politics. He along with Chairman Prachanda and another senior leader Ram Bahadur Thapa 'Badal' got affiliated to the communist movement of Nepal almost at the same time. He took the membership of Communist Party in 1981 and joined the Communist Party of Nepal (Fourth Convention). He became the whole-timer of the party in the year 1983. He was inducted in the Central Committee of the then Communist Party of Nepal (Masal) in 1984. He is among the 5 founding Standing Committee Members of the then Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and served in various departments of the Party. He served as the Head of the Finance Department, Head of the Disciplinary Committee, Head of the Military Academy, and also as the senior member of the International Department of the UCPN (M) in the different timeframes. He currently looks after the Tharuwan State Committee of the party as the In-Charge. Public image He has had different party names popular among the cadres as 'Bimal', 'Ananta' but since a long period of time he is popular with his name 'Prateek'. Though, before and during the People's War, he always acted and helped a lot as the right hand of Chairman Prachanda, he is considered close to Senior Comrade Kiran while it comes to two line struggle.

Geological Society, London, Special Publications 217: 139-190 However, later studies found that Dimorphodon may not be closely related to Peteinosaurus, so this definition of Dimorphodontidae would therefore be superfluous. In 2014, Brian Andres and colleagues defined another clade, Dimorphodontia, as a replacement. Dimorphodontia would include all pterosaurs more closely related to Dimorphodon than to Pterodactylus. According to the analysis published by Andres et al., Dimorphodontia is also a small group, including only Dimorphodon and Parapsicephalus. In 2018, a close relative of Dimorphodon was described from the Late Triassic of North America by Britt and colleagues, and was named Caelestiventus. This discovery expanded the geographic, temporal and also the ecological range of dimorphodontians, as it was discovered in the Late Triassic Nugget Sandstone in Utah, which was a desert at the time. Britt and colleagues also redefined Dimorphodontidae as the least inclusive clade containing Dimorphodon macronyx and Caelestiventus hanseni.

These continuous small adjustments reflect the neural coding process of the visual system, and exist so the brain can attempt to \\"normalize\\" the visual experience.  Research  The aftereffects of exposure to a visual stimulus or pattern causes loss of sensitivity to that pattern and induces stimulus bias. An example of this phenomenon is the \\"lilac chaser\\", introduced by Jeremy Hinton. The stimulus here are lilac circles, that once removed, leave green circles that then become the most prominent stimulus. The fading of the lilac circles is due to a loss of sensitivity to that stimulus and the adaptation to the new stimulus. To experience the \\"lilac chaser\\" effect, the subject needs to fixate their eyes on the cross in the middle of the image, and after a while the effect will settle in. Visual coding, a process involved in visual adaptation, is the means by which the brain adapts to certain stimuli, resulting in a biased perception of those stimuli. This phenomenon is referred to as visual plasticity; the brain's ability to change and adapt according to certain, repeated stimuli, altering the way information is perceived and processed.Lilac Chaser from Jeremy Hinton's experiment The rate and strength of visual adaptation depends heavily on the number of stimuli presented simultaneously, as well as the amount of time for which the stimulus is present. Visual adaptation was found to be weaker when there were more stimuli present. Moreover, studies have found that stimuli can rival each other, which explains why higher numbers of simultaneous stimuli lead to lower stimulus adaptation. Studies have also found that visual adaptation can have a reversing effect; if the stimulus is absent long enough, the aftereffects of visual adaptation will subside. Studies have also shown that visual adaptation occurs in the early stages of processing. Face recognition Perceptual adaptation plays a big role in identifying faces. In an experiment conducted by Gillian Rhodes, the effect of face adaptation was investigated, along with whether visual adaptation affects the recognition of faces. The experiment found that perceptual adaptation does, in fact, affect face recognition. Individuals tend to adapt to common facial features as early as after five minutes of looking at them. This suggests that humans adapt to common facial features, leaving neural resources and space to identify uncommon characteristics and features, which is how humans identify specific faces on a case-by-case basis. Perceptual aftereffects for face recognition occur for several different stimuli, including gender, ethnicity, identity, emotion, and attractiveness of a face. The fact that this distinction occurs, implies that face recognition is a process that happens on a higher level and later on in the visual encoding, rather than early on within visual adaptation. The fact that the aftereffects in face recognition in particular are so strong, suggests that it is for the purpose of regulation of how processes work. This provides a sense of constancy in an individual's perception, while adapting to differences and possible versions of a stimulus allows for constancy and stability, and makes it easier to adapt to variations in a stimulus, while recognizing commonalities. These face perception cues are encoded in an individual's brain for extended periods of time, ensuring consistency over the individual's lifespan. A young person would perceive stimuli the same way as an older individual.  Body size adaptation  Visual aftereffects have also been demonstrated in bodies. Individuals who are exposed to images of low fat (or low muscle) bodies have been shown to perceive subsequently-presented bodies as higher fat (or higher muscle) than they really are (and vice versa). Individuals who are less satisfied with their bodies have been shown to direct more visual attention to thin bodies, resulting in stronger adaptation to thin bodies, suggesting that visual adaptation may provide a mechanism for the association between exposure to thin media portrayals of bodies and body size misperception. Body size adaptation effects are thought to be higher-level aftereffects.

It was used as a passenger station between 1902 and 1929 and as a goods-only station until 1966. It was the terminus of a short spur that curved east from the Normanby Branch of the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway (now the Tees Valley Line). The Normanby Branch was the northern end of the former Cleveland Railway, which had been closed south of Normanby in 1873. The station was the second to bear the name Eston. The original Eston station (which closed on 22 November 1885 and was replaced by South Bank railway station on a nearby site) was not in fact in Eston at all but was two miles north in the industrial settlement of South Bank. When the station was opened by the North Eastern Railway on 1 January 1902, Eston had two railway connections running virtually parallel to each other about a mile apart: the Normanby Branch route to the west of Eston and the older Eston Branch Railway to the east, which had been opened in January 1851 by the mining concern Bolckow Vaughan to transport iron ore from its mines in the Eston Hills. Each branch line was about two miles long and ran north-west to join the main line on either side of Cargo Fleet railway station. The Normanby Branch crossed Flatts Lane at a level crossing just north of the junction with Hollywalk Avenue. Just to the east of the crossing, the line split three ways; a fork to the north-east went to a coal depot serving Normanby, the middle fork went on to Eston and the last fork went south-east to the brickworks of the Normanby Brick & Tile Co.Ordnance Survey Yorkshire Sheet 16.04, 1927 The Eston Branch Railway line took virtually a mirror-image route, with a junction curving south-west into the large railway sidings of the Eston Mines Tip Yard and south-east up an incline to the Eston mines. Although the two branches terminated within only a few hundred yards of each other, they had no physical connection.Ordnance Survey Yorkshire Sheet 17.01, 1895 The Eston Branch had no passenger stations, although the line was used for a while to transport passengers, mainly Bolckow Vaughan employees, to the mines. The former station is now commemorated by a locomotive-shaped planter at the old Flatts Lane level crossing site Eston station was located on Station Road off Eston High Street. It gave direct access to the centre of the old hamlet of Eston and the mining community of California (also called South Eston). It opened on 1 January 1902 and station consisted of a single platform with a modest one- storey wooden station building and a coal depot behind. By 1911 it served a population of 28,095 people. Goods traffic was dominated by bricks, of which 6,416 tons were transported in that year. However, the station was not heavily used by passengers. The number of tickets issued in 1911 was only 46,732 (about 128 a day). By 1925 there were only four trains per day each way, with a fifth on Saturdays, taking about 15 minutes to travel to and from Middlesbrough. The passenger service was withdrawn on 11 March 1929 and replaced with a bus, but the station remained open for goods until 3 October 1966. Nothing now remains of Eston station and its site is now occupied by modern housing. The trackbed of the spur from the Normanby Branch has been made into a footpath and can be walked from the site of the old level crossing at Flatts Lane to Station Road in Eston. The Normanby Branch itself is also now a footpath, the South Bank Walkway, which links Flatts Lane Country Park to South Bank. The station is commemorated by a small locomotive-shaped planter with an information board, installed in 2010 near the old level crossing by the Eston Residents Association.

In the Evans procedure, the peroneus brevis muscle is separated from its musculotendinous compound and its proximal end is sutured to the peroneus longus. Then, an aperture is created from the postero- superior side of the fibula to the lateral malleolar tip. The tendon is then passed from the anterior side towards the posterior side through this aperture and sutured on itself. This procedure was designed to prevent talar tilt by reducing foot inversion and deterring chronic ankle instability. The disadvantage of the Evans procedure is its inability to restore the normal anatomical position of the anterior talofibular ligament. Hence, the stability at inversion is restored. The plantar pressure changes after the modified Evans procedure have not been measured. It is hypothesized that the modified Evans procedure will improve plantar pressure balance in lateral ankle instability.

Parks (1917 ‚Äì November 4, 2009) was the mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan from 1971 to 1976. He was the first African-American to serve in the position. He was also the first African-American elected to the Grand Rapids City Commission in 1968. Recognizing his contributions to the city of Grand Rapids, a statue in his honor was dedicated in 2013 in front of the Grand Rapids City Hall. Early life and education Parks grew up in southern Indiana at Lyles Station. He graduated in 1944 from Wilberforce University and Payne Theological Seminary. Pastoral career He served as pastor to congregations in Marion, Indiana; Richmond, Indiana; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and River Rouge, Michigan. He moved to Grand Rapids in 1966, where he took a position as pastor of First Community AME Church. During his tenure at First Community A.M.E. he grew the church membership and mentored many who continued on into future ministry roles. Supportive of families, Rev. Parks encouraged parents to bring their children to church and participate in the many activities of the church. His sermons were both informative and effective in inspiring people to be involved in the life of their communities. After retiring from First Community A.M.E Church, he was asked to return as pastor of Greater Institutional AME Church in Chicago where he concluded his pastoral career. Political career In 1968 he ran for City Commission representing the city's Third ward, and was elected. In June 1971, he was selected by his fellow commissioners to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of mayor Robert Boelens. In 1973, he ran for the office. Grand Rapids mayoral elections are non-partisan, but Republican U.S. Representative Gerald R. Ford (who would shortly be appointed Vice President and then become President) encouraged businessman and Republican activist Peter Secchia to support Parks' campaign. Parks was elected, defeating 10 other candidates. With his election, Parks became the first African-American mayor of Grand Rapids. Parks' granddaughter Lauri credits him with quietly persuading Amway founders Rich DeVos and Jay Van Andel to purchase and renovate the Pantlind Hotel, the first of many investments to revitalize downtown Grand Rapids. Parks lost his bid for re- election in 1976, to Abe Drasin, and returned to full-time ministry. Governor William Milliken appointed him to the State Officers Compensation Commission in 1982. He retired from First Community in 1985. He moved to Chicago, where he resumed ministry at Greater Institutional AME Church. He moved back to Grand Rapids in 1999, but lived the last year of his life in Lisle, Illinois. He died on November 4, 2009, following a stroke a few days earlier.

Dam system  K√∂nigsberg It is the newest dam in the Harz, built in 1969 in the Grane valley. Because the river Grane itself does not deliver enough water for the 3 km long reservoir, a 7.4 km long diversion channel was built from the Oker river below the Oker Dam. This also collects water from the Gose on the way. A further 4.8 km long diversion runs from the Radau to the Gro√üer Romke and thus into the Oker-Grane Tunnel as well. Likewise there is a 4.6 km long tunnel to the Innerste Dam. The operator of the Grane Dam, as well as its associated diversion systems and waterworks is the Harzwasserwerke. The barrage is an earth dam with asphaltic concrete lining.  Reservoir  The Grane Reservoir (Granestausee) supplies drinking water, acts as flood protection, water regulation and electricity generation. The hydro-electric power station has a power output of 180 kW. The waterworks for drinking water lies higher up on the northern slope. The water from the reservoir is pumped up into a compensating storage basin of 60,000 m¬≥ capacity, from where it flows to the waterworks. The Grane Dam has an average annual discharge of 55 million m¬≥. Because the reservoir provides drinking water, water sports are not allowed. Even motor traffic is kept away from it. A track for maintenance was laid around the reservoir, which is also open to walkers and cyclists and is about 17 km long.

Straftanz consisted of a loose group of artists (j-ing, k-x, -jl- and cyberdominator) who called themselves the Straftanz ZK. Additional artists involved were Carsten Jacek (SITD), Mille Petrozza, and Myk Jung (The Fair Sex) who were involved in the recording of the first album Forward Ever. Straftanz also collaborated with the futurepop project Rotersand by way of sharing ideas and equipment. In interviews, Straftanz described its musical style as \\"Industrial-Streetfighting-Dance\\". In fact, the sound of Straftanz is best described as a mixture of EBM, futurepop, trance, rave, metal, and rhythm noise elements that are tied together with a present dance groove.  History  The track \\"Straftanz\\" was first played at the club Sixx P.M. in Dortmund. DJs copied the demo and spread it across Germany and Europe before any record deal was offered. The German label Dependent signed Straftanz and in October 2006 released the single \\"Straftanz\\" with surprising success, hitting Position 35 on the Deutsche Alternative Jahrescharts, annual collection of the year's most relevant releases. Despite the fact that its lyrics mainly consisted of the names of German alternative clubs and DJs, \\"Straftanz\\" in its various versions covering different areas of Germany (Ost, S√ºd, West and Nord) gained attention at alternative parties worldwide. The UK act Revolution By Night completed a remix of the track entitled \\"Straftanz UK (featuring RBN)\\" for the band, but currently this version has not been made available commercially. However, it was available on the Straftanz Myspace page, picked up club play in the UK, and was played live several times by RBN. After the record label Dependent went out of business, Straftanz changed to the label Scanner and released the EP \\"Tanz Kaputt, was Euch Kaputt Macht!\\" which was followed by the project's first album release Forward Ever. German music magazines covered Straftanz extensively.Catrin Nordwig: Die Tanzfl√§chen Guerilla. In: Sonic Seducer. Mai Ausgabe, 2008, S. 20.Catrin Nordwig: Wof√ºr auch immer. In: Sonic Seducer.

Straftanz played several club shows and festival gigs since the release of the album. In October 2009, Straftanz toured for the first time by joining VNV Nation on the second part of their Of Faith, Power, and Glory tour. In September 2011 Straftanz released its second album Mainstream Sellout Overground in Europe, closely followed by its first US release on Metropolis. In time for the release Straftanz again joined VNV Nation for the European leg of their Automatic tour, covering 18 gigs in 8 countries. In November Straftanz toured the United States for the first time as support band for the Automatic tour.

The club was formed in 1919 out of the merger of Sportclub Ostpreu√üen 1902 K√∂nigsberg and Akademischer Sportclub K√∂nigsberg.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag It played at the Hammerteich-Sportplatz in Ratshof. __TOC__ History Sportclub Ostpreu√üen 1902 K√∂nigsberg Predecessor Ostpreu√üen was formed 1 August 1902, by former K√∂nigsberg FC player Alfred Hirsch and seven of his teammates. The club selected colors and a crest based on symbols of the province: a black eagle on a white background. They were based in the district of Maraunenhof and played their earliest matches against their former parent side, but always came out as losers in those contests. By 1904, several members of the new club had in turn moved on to form Sportzirkel Samland. On 3 September 1904, SCO was a founding member of the city-based Verbandes K√∂nigsberger Ballspiel-Vereine and Hirsch served as the new league's first secretary. The following year the club formed an ice hockey department. Future partner Akademischer Sportclub K√∂nigsberg was established in April and the two clubs quickly struck up a friendly relationship, agreeing to share training facilities. SCO shared similarly friendly relations with other clubs, including SV 05 Elbing, organized by former Ostpreu√üen member Paul Unruh, while SC Prussia Insterburg was regarded as a sister club. SCO marked its first ever win over longtime rival FC, now playing as VfB K√∂nigsberg, in 1913 (3‚Äì1). During World War I, the club's sporting activities were suspended and its sports field requisitioned by the military as a training area. SCO had considerable debt at the end of the war and the club's existence was in question. It was decided to merge with ASC at a meeting held 20 June 1919. Akademischer Sportclub K√∂nigsberg ASC was established on 15 April 1905 by students of Albertina University and grew quickly with departments for athletics, gymnastics, swimming, rowing, and several other sports. By 1906, the club was sharing sports facilities with SCO and later developed a similar relationship with SV Prussia-Samland K√∂nigsberg. In the following years, ASC was very active in organizing sporting events in the city. Spielvereinigung Akademischer Sportclub Ostpreu√üen K√∂nigsberg Following the merger, the combined side remained active in several sports. The footballers of ASCO played three seasons (1936‚Äì38) in the Bezirk K√∂nigsberg, a division of the Gauliga Ostpreu√üen, one of Germany's top-flight regional leagues. SpVgg earned successively poorer results in each campaign and was finally relegated in 1938 with the reorganization of the Gauliga the next season. The club's sporting activities were again suspended due to war when K√∂nigsberg was subject to bombing beginning in August 1944. ASCO disappeared in 1945 following the end of World War II when the city was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed Kaliningrad. However, the tradition of the club was carried on in West Germany with Traditionsgemeinschaft der Leichtathleten aus den deutschen Ostgebieten, an organization established by refugees from the country's former eastern territories.

The character of Happy Sam Sawyer, who was Nick Fury's commanding officer in Sgt. Fury also appear in the series, the characters from the two series crossed over occasionally. The series featured a racially diverse cast much like its precursor, but unlike the characters in the previous series, the so-called Deadly Dozen was much more morally loose, as the series features them sometimes committing war crimes, such as shooting unarmed non-combatants. The final issue of the series, named \\"Did You Ever See A Dozen Die?!\\", ends with virtually every main character dying, something which was unprecedented at the time of its release.Mike Conroy, War Stories: A Graphic History, New York: Ilex/Harper, 2009, , p. 135. Reception Michael Aushenker of The Comics Reporter stated in his 2009 review of the final issue that he had never seen a finale like it before and that it was \\"bad-ass\\" in his opinion. Aushenker described the issue as brutal as well as twisted and added that he believed that it was the most sadistic issue of a comic book ever published with the Comics Code Authority's seal of approval. He also explained that he was shocked that the author and artist got away with it despite the fact that most of the violence was implied off screen. Aushenker went on to say that he believed that the writer, Gary Friedrich, was more worthy of a medal than the series main character and namesake, Michael Kelly, for having written it.

The National Trust of Australia describes the hills as being a \\"distinctive upland ridge located to the west of Geelong, on the south side of the Barwon River\\", that \\"slope steeply on the northern side down to the Barwon River, and more gently southward to the coastal lowland.\\" The area stretches roughly through the modern localities of Gnarwarre, Barrabool and Ceres, and straddles the intersection of the City of Greater Geelong, Surf Coast Shire and Golden Plains Shire. History The area was first settled by pastoralists in the late 1830s. Wynd (1992) suggests that there was less conflict with the Wautharong traditional owners in the Barrabool Hills than further inland, but that incidents where settlers' animals were killed in the area sparked the 187 decision to send Foster Fyans as police sergeant to Geelong in 1837, followed by a thirteen-man military detachment in 1838. An Aboriginal reserve was proposed for the Barrabool Parish in 1840, but the suggestion was ignored and the land sold. The last member of the Barrabool tribe of the Wautharong died in 1885; Wynd attributes intertribal warfare, retaliation murders, disease, liquor, and the loss of their lands as causes of their demise The first road through the Barrabool Hills was surveyed by Alexander Skene in 1839, running from Highton through the \\"Roslin\\", \\"Merrawarp\\" and \\"Strathlachlan\\" estates to Winchelsea (then known as Austin's Ford). The first sale of lands in the Barrabool Hills took place on 5 February 1840, when the lands of the Barrabool Parish, divided up into 25 blocks of varying sizes, were sold. Wynd writes that there was \\"plenty of competition for the rich lands of the Barrabool Hills\\". A sale of the Gnarwarre Parish in the west of the hills on 10 June 1840 was much less successful, with only four blocks being sold; the vast majority of that parish later sold during the 1850s. Transport continued to be a significant challenge through this period, as the road between the hills and Geelong was of very low quality and was claimed to be \\"impassible\\" in winter. The first community building in the region was an Anglican school at Barrabool in 1847, and Ceres became the first settlement in the hills when it was first built in 1850. Throughout the 1850s, the village of Ceres prospered, and a smaller village at Gnarwarre (also known as Shankhill) developed; a number of churches and denominational schools were also built at Barrabool in this era, but a clear centre there never developed. The Barrarbool Road District (note the spelling), the forerunner of the Shire of Barrabool, was created in 1853, and marked both an attempt to resolve the area's transport problems and its first local government. The road board was later renamed \\"Barrabool Hills\\" by the 1850s. The Barrabool Hills became established as a farming area with the development of smaller farms in the late 1840s and 1850s, with a \\"reputation for fertility\\". The 1850s, in addition to the local settlements, saw the development of local farms, including the Berramongo Estate and Suisse Vinyard at Barrabool, both of which still exist today. However, the farmers of the Barrabool Hills also faced a number of difficulties throughout this period. The Barrabool Hills were badly burned in bushfires on 6 February 1851, which killed more than sixteen people. Transporting wheat, the main crop of the hills in this era, to Geelong for milling proved a challenge, and a water mill was built on the Barwon River near Buckley Falls in 1854‚Äì55 to address this. The development of roads continued to be a problem through the 1850s, with much local agitation for the development of key roads between the centres of the Barrabool Hills and the main roads, and for a bridge across the Barwon River, which first happened between Gnarwarre and Murgheboluc at Pollocksford in 1859, and then at Ceres in the 1860s. Vinegrowing Vinegrowing in the Barrabool Hills had been ongoing since 1842, when the Neuchatel vineyard was established. The vineyard was successful, and Wynd suggests that by 1846 the only comparable vineyard in the Port Phillip colony was that of John Pascoe Fawkner in Melbourne. The Berramongo property also planted a vineyard around 1842 or 1843. The \\"Suisse\\" vineyard was established at the corner of Merrawarp Road and Barrabool Road in 1859. The \\"Victoria\\" was established near the Waurn Ponds Creek, the \\"Chillon\\", near the Neuchatel vineyard, and \\"Ceres\\" between Ceres and Highton, were among many to be established. By 1863, Barrabool wine was selling well, and the Geelong Advertiser speculated that the area would become the \\"Victorian Halle aux Vins\\". At one stage, the Ceres-Barrabool area had 29 vineyards. However, the industry declined in the 1870s, and a phylloxera vasiatrix outbreak, first detected in 1877, marked the end of the industry for many years. Attempts to manage it failed, and by the end of 1882 the entire Geelong region was finished as a winegrowing region. There were small attempts to revitalise the industry in the 1880s and 1890s, but the industry did not return to the Barrabool Hills area until the 1970s. Self- governance and decline The Barrabool Hills area gained full local government with the development of the Shire of Barrabool in 1865. Two other short-lived organisations briefly existed in this era to address grievances held by local farmers: a Barrabool Hills Protection Association had been formed in May 1858 to grievances held by local farmers, and a Barrabool Hills Protection Association had been formed in May 1858 to support protectionist policies, and the Barrabool Farmers' Association formed in 1870 to address a range of issues with the authorities. The number of people occupying land across the Shire of Barrabool declined substantially from the 1860s to the 1890s, as many settlers left the district and farm sizes once again became larger. The wheat industry in the Barrabool Hills declined markedly, with farmers trying livestock and a variety of other crops as alternatives; it remained known as a farming district, and much of the district converted to selling hay. While progress was made with a number of key road connections in around the Barrabool Hills through the 1870s and 1880s, the hills began to diminish in importance compared to lands further south. The development of railways through the area saw lines to the south and north of the Barrabool Hills, but no line in the hills region. By the early 20th century, the Gnarwarre (or Shankill) village had largely shut down, the assortment of facilities at Barrabool was in decline, and the village of Ceres, while surviving, shrank considerably. Today Gnarwarre and Barrabool remain sparsely-populated rural localities today; Ceres has seen a small increase in recent years due to its proximity to Geelong and scenic views. A number of commercial and social developments in Highton, on the edge of the Barrabool Hills, have adopted the Barrabool Hills name in the 21st century. These include the Barrabool Hills Baptist Church, in Province Boulevard, and the Barrabool Hills Shopping Centre, currently being developed on the corner of Stoneleigh Crescent and Province Boulevard, Highton.

Concrete degradation may have various causes. Concrete can be damaged by fire, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, calcium leaching, physical damage and chemical damage (from carbonatation, chlorides, sulfates and non-distilled water). This process adversely affects concrete exposed to these damaging stimuli. Aggregate expansion alkali-silica reaction affecting a concrete step barrier on a US motorway (photograph, courtesy of the Federal Highway Administration, US Department of Transportation). Various types of aggregate undergo chemical reactions in concrete, leading to damaging expansive phenomena. The most common are those containing reactive silica, that can react (in the presence of water) with the alkalis in concrete (K2O and Na2O, coming principally from cement). Among the more reactive mineral components of some aggregates are opal, chalcedony, flint and strained quartz. Following the alkali-silica reaction (ASR), an expansive gel forms, that creates extensive cracks and damage on structural members. On the surface of concrete pavements the ASR can cause pop-outs, i.e. the expulsion of small cones (up to in diameter), corresponding to aggregate particle size. When some aggregates containing dolomite are used, a dedolomitization reaction occurs where the magnesium carbonate compound reacts with hydroxyl ions and yields magnesium hydroxide and a carbonate ion. The resulting expansion may cause destruction of the material. Far less common are pop-outs caused by the presence of pyrite, an iron sulfide that generates expansion by forming iron oxide and ettringite. Other reactions and recrystallizations, e.g. hydration of clay minerals in some aggregates, may lead to destructive expansion as well. Corrosion of reinforcement bars Example of flat piece of concrete having dislodged with corroded rebar underneath, Welland River bridge across Queen Elizabeth Way in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The expansion of the corrosion products (iron oxides) of carbon steel reinforcement structures may induce mechanical stress that can cause the formation of cracks and disrupt the concrete structure. If rebars have been improperly installed or have inadequate concrete cover at surfaces exposed to the elements, oxide jacking and spalling can occur during the structure's lifetime: flat fragments of concrete are detached from the concrete mass as a result of the rebar's corrosion. Corrosion and its prevention is of considerable importance in the design and construction of steel reinforced concrete structures.Alok Singh and Divya Prakash Tiwari. ‚ÄúEffect of Carbon Leaching in a Building Structure‚Äù, United International Journal for Research & Technology (UIJRT) 1.1 (2019): 34-38. Chemical damage Alkali‚Äìsilica reaction (ASR) The alkali‚Äìsilica reaction (ASR) is a deleterious chemical reaction between the alkali ( and , in fact dissolved NaOH and KOH) of the cement paste with reactive amorphous (non-crystalline) siliceous aggregates in the presence of moisture. This reaction produces a gel-like substance of sodium silicate ( ‚Ä¢ n ), also noted ‚Ä¢ n , or N-S-H (sodium silicate hydrate). This hygroscopic gel swells inside the affected reactive aggregates which expand and crack. In its turn, it causes concrete expansion. If concrete is heavily reinforced, it can first cause some prestressing effect before cracking and damaging the structure. Carbonation Carbonation-initiated deterioration of concrete at Hippodrome Wellington, Belgium. Carbon dioxide from air can react with the calcium hydroxide in concrete to form calcium carbonate. This process is called carbonation, which is essentially the reversal of the chemical process of calcination of lime taking place in a cement kiln. Carbonation of concrete is a slow and continuous process progressing from the outer surface inward, but slows down with increasing diffusion depth. Carbonation has two effects: it increases mechanical strength of concrete, but it also decreases alkalinity, which is essential for corrosion prevention of the reinforcement steel. Below a pH of 10, the steel's thin layer of surface passivation dissolves and corrosion is promoted. For the latter reason, carbonation is an unwanted process in concrete chemistry. It can be tested by applying phenolphthalein solution, a pH indicator, over a fresh fracture surface, which indicates non-carbonated and thus alkaline areas with a violet color. Chloride attack The main effect of chloride anions on reinforced concrete is to cause pitting corrosion of the steel reinforcement bars (rebar). It is a surreptitious and dangerous form of localized corrosion because the rebar sections can be decreased to the point that the steel reinforcement are no longer capable to withstand to the tensile efforts they are supposed to resist by design. When the rebar sections are too small or the rebar are locally broken, the reinforcements are lost and concrete is no longer reinforced concrete. Chlorides, particularly calcium chloride, have been used to shorten the setting time of concrete. However, calcium chloride and (to a lesser extent) sodium chloride have been shown to leach calcium hydroxide and cause chemical changes in Portland cement, leading to loss of strength, as well as attacking the steel reinforcement present in most concrete. The ten-storey Queen Elizabeth hospital in Kota Kinabalu contained a high percentage of chloride causing early failure. External sulfate attacks (ESA) Sulfates in solution in contact with concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the weakening of the cement binder (chemical sulfate attack). Sulfate solutions can also cause damage to porous cementitious materials through crystallization and recrystallization (salt attack). Sulfates and sulfites are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present from many sources, including gypsum (calcium sulfate) often present as an additive in 'blended' cements which include fly ash and other sources of sulfate. With the notable exception of barium sulfate, most sulfates are slightly to highly soluble in water. These include acid rain where sulfur dioxide in the airshed is dissolved in rainfall to produce sulfurous acid. In lightning storms, the dioxide is oxidised to trioxide making the residual sulfuric acid in rainfall even more highly acidic. Local government infrastructure is most commonly corroded by sulfate arising from the oxidation of sulfide which occurs when bacteria (for example in sewer mains) reduce the ever-present hydrogen sulfide gas to a film of sulfide (S-) or bi-sulfide (HS-) ions. This reaction is reversible, both readily oxidising on exposure to air or oxygenated stormwater, to produce sulfite or sulfate ions and acidic hydrogen ions in the reaction HS‚àí \\\\+ H2O+ O2 -> 2H+ \\\\+ SO4-. The corrosion often present in the crown (top) of concrete sewers is directly attributable to this process - known as crown rot corrosion. Delayed ettringite formation (DEF) When the temperature of concrete exceeds 65 ¬∞C during a too long time at the early age, the crystallization of ettringite (AFt) does not occur because of its higher solubility at elevated temperature and the then less soluble mono- sulfate (AFm) is formed. After dissipation of the cement hydration heat, temperature goes back to ambient and the temperature curves of the solubilities of AFt and AFm phases cross over. The mono-sulfate (AFm) now more soluble at low temperature slowly dissolves to recrystallize as the less soluble ettringite (AFt). AFt crystal structure hosts more water molecules than AFm. So, AFt has a higher molar volume than AFm because of its 32 H2O molecules. During months, or years, after young concrete cooling, AFt crystallizes very slowly as small acicular needles and can exert a considerable crystallization pressure on the surrounding hardened cement paste (HCP). This leads to the expansion of concrete, to its cracking, and it can ultimately lead to the ruin of the affected structure. The characteristic feature of delayed ettringite formation (DEF) is a random honeycomb cracking similar to this of the alkali-silica reaction (ASR). In fact this crack pattern is common to all expansive internal reactions or to hindered shrinkage. DEF is also known as internal sulfate attack (ISA). External sulfate attack (ESA) also involves ettringite (AFt) formation and deleterious expansion with the same harmful symptoms but requires an external source of sulfate anions in the surrounding terrains or environment. To avoid DEF or ISA reactions, the best way is to use a low C3A (tri-calcium aluminate) cement precluding the formation of ettringite (AFt). Sulfate resisting (SR) cements have also a low content in Al2O3. Calcium leaching Example of secondary efflorescence in parking garage exposed to diluted road salt from vehicles entering the garage during winter. When water flows through cracks present in concrete, water may dissolve various minerals present in the hardened cement paste or in the aggregates, if the solution is unsaturated with respect to them. Dissolved ions, such as calcium (Ca2+), are leached out and transported in solution some distance. If the physico-chemical conditions prevailing in the seeping water evolve with distance along the water path and water becomes supersaturated with respect to certain minerals, they can further precipitate, making calthemite deposits (predominately calcium carbonate) inside the cracks, or at the concrete outer surface. This process can cause the self- healing of fractures in particular conditions. Stalactites growing beneath a concrete structure as a result of calcium hydroxide being leached from concrete and deposited as calcium carbonate to create calthemite forms beneath structure.Calthemite flowstone stained orange from rusting reinforcing (iron oxide) being deposited along with calcium carbonate. =Decalcification= Within set concrete there remains some free \\"calcium hydroxide\\" (Ca(OH)2), which can further dissociate to form Ca2+ and hydroxide (OH‚àí) ions\\". Any water which finds a seepage path through micro cracks and air voids present in concrete, will readily carry the (Ca(OH)2) and Ca2+ (depending on solution pH and chemical reaction at the time) to the underside of the structure where leachate solution contacts the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere readily diffuses into the leachate and causes a chemical reaction, which precipitates (deposits) calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on the outside of the concrete structure. Consisting primarily of CaCO3 this secondary deposit derived from concrete is known as \\"calthemite\\" and can mimic the shapes and forms of cave \\"speleothems\\", such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone etc. Other trace elements such as iron from rusting reinforcing may be transported and deposited by the leachate at the same time as the CaCO3. This may colour the calthemites orange or red. The chemistry involving leaching of calcium hydroxide from concrete can facilitate the growth of calthemites up to ‚âà200 times faster than cave speleothems due to the different chemical reactions involved. The sight of calthemite is a visual sign that calcium is being leached from the concrete structure and the concrete is gradually degrading. In very old concrete where the calcium hydroxide has been leached from the leachate seepage path, the chemistry may revert to that similar to \\"speleothem\\" chemistry in limestone cave. This is where carbon dioxide enriched rain or seepage water forms a weak carbonic acid, which leaches calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from within the concrete structure and carries it to the underside of the structure. When it contacts the atmosphere, carbon dioxide degasses and calcium carbonate is precipitated to create calthemite deposits, which mimic the shapes and forms of speleothems. This degassing chemistry is not common in concrete structures as the leachate can often find new paths through the concrete to access free calcium hydroxide and this reverts the chemistry to that previously mentioned where CO2 is the reactant. Sea water Concrete heavily degradated after long-time exposition to seawater in the tidal zone Concrete exposed to seawater is susceptible to its corrosive effects. The effects are more pronounced above the tidal zone than where the concrete is permanently submerged. In the submerged zone, magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions precipitate a layer of brucite, about 30 micrometers thick, on which a slower deposition of calcium carbonate as aragonite occurs. These layers somewhat protect the concrete from other processes, which include attack by magnesium, chloride and sulfate ions and carbonatation. Above the water surface, mechanical damage may occur by erosion by waves themselves or sand and gravel they carry, and by crystallization of salts from water soaking into the concrete pores and then drying up. Pozzolanic cements and cements using more than 60% of slag as aggregate are more resistant to sea water than pure Portland cement. Sea water corrosion contains elements of both chloride and sulfate corrosion. Bacterial corrosion Bacteria themselves do not have noticeable effect on concrete. However, sulfate-reducing bacteria in untreated sewage tend to produce hydrogen sulfide, which is then oxidized by aerobic bacteria present in biofilm on the concrete surface above the water level to sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid dissolves the carbonates in the cured cement and causes strength loss, as well as producing sulfates which are harmful to concrete. Concrete floors lying on ground that contains pyrite (iron(II) sulfide) are also at risk. As a preventive measure sewage may be pretreated to increase pH or oxidize or precipitate the sulfides in order to inhibit the activity of sulfide utilizing bacteria. Physical damage Damage can occur during the casting and de-shuttering processes. For instance, the corners of beams can be damaged during the removal of shuttering because they are less effectively compacted by means of vibration (improved by using form-vibrators). Other physical damage can be caused by the use of steel shuttering without base plates. The steel shuttering pinches the top surface of a concrete slab due to the weight of the next slab being constructed. Concrete slabs, block walls and pipelines are susceptible to cracking during ground settlement, seismic tremors or other sources of vibration, and also from expansion and contraction during adverse temperature changes. Thermal damage Due to its low thermal conductivity, a layer of concrete is frequently used for fireproofing of steel structures. However, concrete itself may be damaged by fire. An example of this was the 1996 Channel fire, where the fire reduced the thickness of concrete in an undersea tunnel connecting France with England. For this reason, common fire testing standards, such as ASTM E119, do not permit fire testing of cementitious products unless the relative humidity inside the cementitious product is at or below 75%. Otherwise, concrete can be subject to significant spalling. Up to about 300 ¬∞C, the concrete undergoes normal thermal expansion. Above that temperature, shrinkage occurs due to water loss; however, the aggregate continues expanding, which causes internal stresses. Up to about 500 ¬∞C, the major structural changes are carbonatation and coarsening of pores. At 573 ¬∞C, quartz undergoes rapid expansion due to phase transition, and at 900 ¬∞C calcite starts shrinking due to decomposition. At 450-550 ¬∞C the cement hydrate decomposes, yielding calcium oxide. Calcium carbonate decomposes at about 600 ¬∞C. Rehydration of the calcium oxide on cooling of the structure causes expansion, which can cause damage to material which withstood fire without falling apart. Concrete in buildings that experienced a fire and were left standing for several years shows extensive degree of carbonatation from carbon dioxide which is reabsorbed. Concrete exposed to up to 100 ¬∞C is normally considered as healthy. The parts of a concrete structure that is exposed to temperatures above approximately 300 ¬∞C (dependent of water/cement ratio) will most likely get a pink color. Over approximately 600 ¬∞C the concrete will turn light grey, and over approximately 1000 ¬∞C it turns yellow- brown. One rule of thumb is to consider all pink colored concrete as damaged that should be removed. Fire will expose the concrete to gases and liquids that can be harmful to the concrete, among other salts and acids that occur when gases produced by a fire come into contact with water. If concrete is exposed to very high temperatures very rapidly, explosive spalling of the concrete can result. In a very hot, very quick fire the water inside the concrete will boil before it evaporates. The steam inside the concrete exerts expansive pressure and can initiate and forcibly expel a spall. Radiation damages Exposure of concrete structures to neutrons and gamma radiations in nuclear power plants and high-flux material testing reactor can induce radiation damages in their concrete structures. Paramagnetic defects and optical centers are easily formed, but very high fluxes are necessary to displace a sufficiently high number of atoms in the crystal lattice of minerals present in concrete before significant mechanical damage is observed. Repairs and strengthening It may be necessary to repair a concrete structure following damage (e.g. due to age, chemical attack, fire, impact, movement or reinforcement corrosion). Strengthening may be necessary if the structure is weakened (e.g. due to design or construction errors, excessive loading, or because of a change of use). Repair techniques The first step should always be an investigation to determine the cause of the deterioration. The general principles of repair include: arresting and preventing further degradation; treating exposed steel reinforcement; and filling fissures or holes caused by cracking or left after the loss of spalled or damaged concrete; Various techniques are available for the repair, protection and rehabilitation of concrete structures, and specifications for repair principals have been defined systematically. The selection of the appropriate approach will depend on the cause of the initial damage (e.g. impact, excessive loading, movement, corrosion of the reinforcement, chemical attack, or fire) and whether the repair is to be fully load-bearing or simply cosmetic. Repair principles which do not improve the strength or performance of concrete beyond its original (undamaged) condition include: replacement and restoration of concrete after spalling and delamination; strengthening to restore structural load-bearing capacity; and increasing resistance to physical or mechanical attack. Repair principles for arresting and preventing further degradation include: control of anodic areas; cathodic protection, cathodic control; increasing resistivity; preserving or restoring passivity; increasing resistance to chemical attack; protection against ingress of adverse agents; and moisture control. Techniques for filling holes left by the removal of spalled or damaged concrete include: mortar repairs; flowing concrete repairs and sprayed concrete repairs. The filling of cracks, fissures or voids in concrete for structural purposes (restoration of strength and load-bearing capability), or non-structural reasons (flexible repairs where further movement is expected, or alternately to resist water and gas permeation) typically involves the injection of low viscosity resins or grouts based on epoxy, PU or acrylic resins, or micronised cement slurries. One novel proposal for the repair of cracks is to use bacteria. BacillaFilla is a genetically engineered bacterium designed to repair damaged concrete, filling in the cracks, and making them whole again. Strengthening techniques Various techniques are available for strengthening concrete structures, to increase the load-carrying capacity or else to improve the in-service performance. These include increasing the concrete cross-section, and adding material such as steel plate or fiber composites to enhance the tensile capacity or increase the confinement of the concrete for improved compression capacity.

Nguvauva was born at Musorakuumba, a settlement near Okahandja, and became chief of the Mbanderu in 1880, succeeding his father Munjuku Nguvauva. During his chieftaincy, Nguvauva was involved in constant hostilities with fellow Herero chiefs. He also was an outspoken opponent of the encroaching settlers of Imperial Germany. The Germans supported Samuel Maharero to become Paramount Chief, and when his competitors, among them Nguvauva, did not accept this, they were stripped of their chieftaincy. Nguvauva's resistance eventually led to skirmishes with the German Schutztruppe, the protection force deployed in the colony. He sent his son Hiatuvao Nguvauva with several followers to Ngamiland (part of present-day Botswana), starting an exodus of Ovaherero from South West Africa to Botswana that only ended after the Herero and Namaqua Genocide of 1904‚Äî1907. In May 1896 in the Battle of Sturmfeld, Nguvauva was wounded and surrendered. Accused of organising the uprising against the Germans he was sentenced to death and executed in Okahandja. Sources place the day of execution on June 11, 12, or 13. His tombstone puts the date of death on 11 June 1896.

The episode originally aired in the United States on September 28, 2007 as the second of two previews for the series on Disney Channel. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews, especially for the originality of its title. Fan reaction was also favorable, and the featured musical number \\"Backyard Beach\\" was voted the number 2 song in the series by viewers during the \\"Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown\\" event. Plot summary Due to an intense heat wave striking Danville, stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb are exhausted and do nothing but rest in their backyard. Eventually, they decide to build a beach in their backyard to spite a morning radio DJ. Their sister Candace wants to expose them to their mother for doing so, but she only sees their initial draft of a small sandbox with water and brushes it off. Some time later, they successfully construct a full- scale beach, to which everyone in the neighborhood, including Isabella and her Fireside Girls troop go to cool off and enjoy themselves. Candace sees this and once again is set to inform their mother. This mood soon changes, when she finds out that Jeremy, a boy for whom she has romantic feelings for, will be coming to the beach to surf so she decides to stay. She finds pleasure in the beach after being crowned \\"Queen Wahini\\" following an accidentally flawless limbo performance and catches the attention of Jeremy. Meanwhile, Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry investigates the recent theft of lawn gnomes across the tri-state area by his nemesis Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. He enters Doofenshmirtz's underground lair and is immediately captured where Doofenshmirtz explains via video that his family fell to poverty during his youth which results in the repossession of their lawn-gnome which protects them from black magic. Believing his family to be unprotected, Doofenshmirtz's father forced his son to dress as a gnome and stand in front of their garden the entire day, unable to move and he became like the Statue of Liberty in New York City. For his hardship, Doofenshmirtz seeks revenge and plans on destroying all of the lawn gnomes he has stolen. Perry soon breaks out of his trap, and begins to brawl with the doctor, which inadvertently causes the machine containing all of the gnomes to malfunction. The machine releases all of the lawn gnomes and they erupt onto the beach. The beach goers flee in panic of \\"gnomeageddon\\" and the beach is destroyed. Candace does not realize this as she is trying to convince her mother not to come in and ruin her good time, so when she tries to justify the beach's existence, she finds nothing but their normal backyard. Candace is depressed, but the boys find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says that tomorrow will be hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds \\"with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes\\", to which Phineas laughs. There is then a zoom-out as the gnomes that crashed into the Flynn-Fletcher household roof are seen.

It was originally broadcast as the second of two special previews of the series on Disney Channel on September 28, 2007, at 10:45 p.m., Eastern/Pacific Time. Disney Channel released a press release for the episode on September 19, 2007. The announcement contained a summary of a B-Plot which did not appear in the episode's final broadcast. The plot detailed the boys' father, Lawrence, taking advantage of the recent inclusion of sand in his backyard to search for a rare bottle cap. In doing so, Lawrence forms a bond with the boys' friend Baljeet, who is also a collector of such rare novelties. Actor Vincent Martella, who voices Phineas, cited \\"Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror\\" as a highlight of working on the series. In an article for Popstar!

In 1928, the Jameses quit Cornish after the school's board of directors objected to a production of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author because of its brothel scene. They formed the Seattle Repertory Playhouse (no relation to today's Seattle Repertory Theatre). The venturesome, multi-ethnic, multiracial, and sometimes explicitly socialist company performed a wide repertoire, ranging \\"from popular comedies to works by Ibsen and Goethe\\". In 1930, they established themselves in the Playhouse Theatre, which they constructed in a former tile warehouse at the corner of NE 41st Street and University Way NE (\\"The Ave\\") in the University District. The Jameses also taught some classes at the University of Washington.Nancy Wick, Playing With History, Columns (University of Washington alumni magazine), December 1995. Accessed online 2009-11-05. In 1933 the theater scored a major success with In Abraham's Bosom. Featuring a largely black cast and a gospel choir, it was co- produced with Seattle's First African Methodist Episcopal Church. When the Federal Theatre Project began in 1935 during the New Deal era, the University of Washington's director Glenn Hughes applied to the program for funding for a unit. The Jameses applied separately to start a unit with Negro actors, to be housed at their theater with them as producers and directors. The proposal was funded, as were those of Hughes and two other FTP units in Seattle. The resulting Negro Repertory Company was founded in January 1936, in cooperation with the Seattle Urban League. Federal Theatre Project national director Hallie Flanagan considered the company the best \\"Negro unit\\" in the program, and historian Rena Fraden says that they put on \\"some of the most experimental of productions of any Negro unit.\\" Historian Quintard Taylor estimates that as many as 200 African Americans‚Äîabout 5 percent of Seattle's black population in 1940‚Äîwere involved with at least one of the productions over the next several years. The company put on plays such as Paul Peters and George Sklar's Stevedore‚Äîalready a success in New York‚Äîin which a Black waterfront union organizer is unjustly framed for the rape of a white woman, and his union fights back. The state administrator of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which oversaw the FTP, shut down a 1937 production of Lysistrata after one night, although he had not personally seen it, because his wife and secretary complained about its risque nature. The Negro Repertory Company was performing it at the larger Moore Theatre. The players rejected producing George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess after some rehearsals, because they found the material degrading and offensive. The Jameses resigned in 1937 after a public furor over their production of Power, about public utilities, but continued to operate their theater. The NRC was combined with another FTP unit and survived for as long as funding did. In 1939, the U.S. Congress terminated the Federal Theatre Project after years of increasing criticism about some of its productions and concerns about socialist or communist associations of its directors and productions. Seattle's pioneering impresario of jazz in a concert setting,Paul deBarros, Jackson Street After Hours (1993), Seattle: Sasquatch Books, . Norm Bobrow, promoted weekly Sunday concerts at the Playhouse Theatre for two years starting in May 1946. After World War II, as the Cold War era began, the Jameses stuck to their socialist views, continuing to stage pro-labor plays and opening their hall to the Group Health Cooperative and Washington State Pension Union. In 1948, the Jameses had to testify before the Washington State Legislature's Canwell Committee, which was investigating communist activity at the University of Washington in the postwar era of heightened anxiety. The Jameses lost subscribers, and by 1950, their theater was in financial trouble. They sold it to the university. Burton James's health failed about the same time; Florence James continued her theater work in Saskatchewan, Canada. The University era The university renamed the building the University of Washington Playhouse Theatre and made regular use of it for their growing drama department. In 1967, Greg Falls (later the founder of Seattle's ACT Theatre), influenced by the ideas of such avant garde directors as Peter Brook, converted the building from a proscenium to a thrust stage. From 2007 to 2009, the university carried out a major reconstruction of the building, working with LMN Architects of Seattle: it raised the roof an extra story, improved sight lines and lighting capabilities, and brought the building up to present-day seismic standards. The building was renamed the Floyd and Delores Jones Playhouse, in honor of a foundation that donated US$2.4 million to the project. Floyd Jones, who is still alive, sees the name as a tribute to his late wife, who was \\"devoted to the arts, social justice, and Democratic politics‚Ä¶ always thrilled when they took on plays‚Ä¶ like All Powers Necessary and Convenient\\", which was about the Canwell hearings of the 1940s.

Founded by guitarist Chris Lotesto formerly of Latent Fury, Ion Vein has released three studio albums, two digital EPs, and appeared on several tribute and compilation albums. Producer Neil Kernon, produced/engineered/mixed their second album Reigning Memories and third album Ion Vein. Ion Vein's first two albums have been described as prog/power metal.  History  Early years (1995‚Äì1998) Originally formed in 1989, as Latent Fury, by lead guitarist Chris Lotesto, the band released a self-titled three-song demo in 1991, dubbed ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù by many European fans, before lineup changes resulted in that era coming to an end along with the necessity of a name change in 1994. Lotesto, along with remaining Latent Fury members, John Ashe, Dan Charatin, and Mike Holewinski, pressed on as Ion Vein, a name Ashe came up with to describe what the effect the band wanted their music to have on fans, for most of 1995 before various circumstances led Lotesto to re-group and re-form the band under the same moniker at the end of that year. Enter vocalist, Russ Klimczak, a high school friend of Lotesto's, and member of another popular southside Chicago band called Counter Attak. The two admired each other's work for quite some time and talked of joining forces several times during '95 as Counter Attak had broken up earlier that year. The start of 1996 saw Klimczak and Lotesto paired up for what would be the true beginning of Ion Vein as a band. Lotesto already had most of the songs written for what would become the debut album, Beyond Tomorrow, when he and Klimczak started working together, so when he answered an ad for a drummer in a local music paper in March, Scott Lang entered the fold and the three were off to find the remaining pieces of the puzzle. A year-long search briefly brought Klimczak's old band mates, rhythm guitarist John Malufka, and bassist, Brian Rossin, into the fold, at the start of 1997, to record the Promo Sampler 1997 limited release containing the songs \\"Reflections Unclear\\" and \\"The Bridge of Dawn\\". The timing wasn't right for Malufka and Rossin to remain in the band and so the search for a permanent bassist and second guitarist continued. Finally, in September, as luck would have it, the same paper that yielded Lang would once again bring Ion Vein another strong player in bassist, Brian Gordon. The band forged on for another month as a four piece when upon returning from vacation, Lotesto was surprised to see Malufka at rehearsal with all of his gear plugged in and ready to go. Klimczak was able to finally talk his childhood best friend, and high school mate of both he and Lotesto, into coming out of his self-imposed hiatus to join Ion Vein full-time. Ion Vein was officially \\"born,\\" and rolling with a full head of steam, playing their first show together in November 1997. Beyond Tomorrow (1998‚Äì2002) After hitting the Chicago club circuit in November, the band honed its skills on stage before the recording of Beyond Tomorrow was to begin in the summer of 1998. The band caught a break and were asked to perform at Powermad, an up-and-coming underground prog/power metal festival in Baltimore, Maryland, in August 1998, where they walked in completely unknown, and walked out with a very strong buzz in the metal underground after \\"blowing the roof off the place\\" as many in attendance proclaimed. The experience at Powermad was quite an eye-opener and the band realized that their debut album needed to be stronger than it currently was, so they decided to take it to another studio to remix and remaster it before releasing it. A few offers from small record labels rolled in, but the band decided it was in their best interest to release Beyond Tomorrow on their label, Majesphere Records, to help generate enough buzz independently in hopes of landing a deal on a grander scale. The album was released in February 1999, and while getting a lot of positive press worldwide, it failed to attract a larger label that could help propel the band to the next level. In the meantime, however, Ion Vein did attract the attention of Dwell Records, best known for their internationally distributed tribute albums, and songs were contributed to their Iron Maiden, Ozzy, Dio, King Diamond, and Queensr√øche tribute albums between 1998 and 2000, further garnering the band fans and critical acclaim around the world. In March 2000, Gordon announced his departure and was replaced with Jonathon Quigley in July of that year. Quigley proved to be a strong writer and made an immediate impact during the writing sessions for the next album. Other key moments during this period included opening for Armored Saint, Flotsam and Jetsam, Iced Earth, Nevermore, and Angra; appearances at Chicago Powerfest, and ProgPower USA; and being named to the \\"Top 5 New Bands of 1998\\" and \\"Top 5 local albums 1999\\" in the Midwest Beat Magazine's reader's poll, and \\"Best Metal Band 1999\\" in Chicago's Suburban Nitelife Magazine reader's poll. Reigning Memories (2002‚Äì2006) Realizing their sophomore album had to be something really special, Lotesto contacted Grammy winning producer, Neil Kernon (Queensr√øche, Judas Priest, Nevermore, Hall & Oates, etc.), who agreed to produce, engineer, and mix the new album. The sessions for Reigning Memories began in July 2001 but were plagued by a variety of technical and scheduling problems that lead to drastic delays and frustration. During the sessions, the band parted with Quigley in November 2002 and Gordon was brought in the studio to redo all the bass tracks. The album was mixed in December, mastered in March, and released as a 'US only' limited release in May 2003 on Majesphere Records, as the band continued to shop for a larger label home. While strong reviews and press continued to pour in, the prospects for major indie record deal seemed to drift further and further away so the band decided to release the album worldwide via Majesphere in September 2003. Shortly thereafter, the band parted ways with drummer, Scott Lang, in October 2003 and replaced him with Chuck White (ex-Michael Angelo Batio, Winterkill, Spirit Web) in December 2003. Additionally, Andy Bunk (ex-Braindance), who joined Ion Vein on bass in December 2002, announced his departure in November 2003, and rhythm guitarist, John Malufka, announced his retirement from being an active musician in February 2004. Gordon returned to the fold on bass as a full-time member once again in September 2004 and the band continued as a four piece with Andy Parades (ex-Talamasca) temporarily filling in on rhythm guitar when possible for live dates. During this period of turmoil, however, Ion Vein was approached by a few overseas labels that took a very keen interest in how Reigning Memories was developing in the European market. After some very positive discussions, the band decided to sign with the UK's Now & Then Records, whom, at the time, had a very good reputation in the industry, in May 2004 for a full scale release of Reigning Memories throughout the Europe and Far East markets. Frustrations began to set in as Now & Then sat on the album for a full year before finally releasing it in April 2005 and communication with the label became quite difficult and eventually non-existent. The band released a statement in March 2006 proclaiming their official parting of ways with Now & Then and continued moving forward. This period of turmoil and evolution was not quite finished yet, however, and to the surprise of many, the band announced the parting of ways with vocalist, Russ Klimczak, in May 2006, thus closing the first chapter of the Ion Vein story after a solid 10-year run. Other key moments during this period included opening for Overkill, King's X, Metal Church, Trouble, Loudness, Symphony X, Sonata Arctica, and Seven Witches; appearance at the Brave Words, Bloody Knuckles fest in Cleveland, Ohio, and Louder, Harder, Faster fest in Allentown, Pennsylvania; and having Reigning Memories named in the \\"Top 10 Local Albums of 2003\\" (#7) by the Northwest Indiana Times, and reviewed by Greg Kot in the Chicago Tribune. New album and rebuilding (2006‚Äì2011) With the basic tracks for their third album complete by late summer 2006, Ion Vein was now faced with the arduous task of finding a new vocalist that not only could complement the more focused, in-your-face heaviness of the new album, but elevate the band beyond anything they had achieved up to this point. The band pressed on for 18 months, holding countless auditions, and regular weekly rehearsals, with only the belief in the strength of the new material to help them carry them onward. In late August 2007, Allen James joined the fold, and the band spent the rest of the year demoing and refining vocal tracks, before getting back in the studio with Kernon in December/January. Four tracks were mixed for shopping to labels, and Ion Vein finally returned to the stage in full form at Chicago Powerfest 2008, appearing once again, with Iced Earth to a packed house. The band finished recording and mixing the album, and continued a very strong run of live dates in the Chicago area, but was forced to bring their newfound momentum to a grinding halt at the end of 2009, parting ways with James, and Gordon, due to irreconcilable differences. Ion Vein kicked off 2010 with a renewed energy, and as luck, or fate, would have it, Lotesto got an email at the beginning of February from, vocalist, Scott Featherstone (Enertia, ex-Attica USA), whom he had known, and been a big fan of since Ion Vein and Enertia first began playing shows together in early 2000. Lotesto promptly sent three tracks from Enertia's, Kernon produced, Force album, to White, and he immediately knew as well, that Featherstone was exactly what Ion Vein needed. Upstate New York based, Featherstone, started recording vocal demos to the finished basic tracks in his home studio in March, and after making his way out to Chicago for their first live pre- production rehearsal in September, was ready to return in November to start tracking with Kernon. As of early 2011, the band was very excited about the recordings and looking forward to finishing up the album so they can get back out on the road. Rob Such (Twelfth Gate, ex-Syris) joined the fold on bass in the summer of 2011 thus rounding out the line-up. IV v1.0 (2011‚Äì2012) Things took quite a bit longer than planned but after partnering with Chicago- based Mortal Music, the band released a three song DR (digital release) on September 27, containing the three tracks ‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove/Hate,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnger Inside,‚Äù to very positive reviews. The DR concept was developed by Mortal Music as taking a snap shot of an album of music and releasing it into the market a \\"chapter\\" at a time, so to speak, to allow it to work its way into the marketplace faster and to help alleviate the musical overload fans and press alike are experiencing these days with so many options available. The full-length album will then be available on CD at the end of the cycle for those that still collect physical product. The band finally returned to the stage on February 10, 2012 supporting the mighty Testament (band), and plans for releasing the next DR, and touring, are currently underway. IV v2.0 (2012‚Äì2014) Ion Vein released their second three song DR (digital release) on 12-10-12 which features the tracks ‚ÄúSeamless (Take Me Away),‚Äù ‚ÄúFool‚Äôs Parade,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis Is Me‚Äù to more favorable reviews, further cementing their path in the metal community with the new line-up. In September 2012, the band shared the stage with prog metal band, Symphony X, allowing them to debut the IV v2.0 songs to a live audience before the December release and in hopeful preparation for a tour. While a tour never materialized in 2013, a headlining show at Chicago's infamous Metro Chicago in February and support slot for prog metal legends Fates Warning (who were very influential in the early years of the IV) served to be significant highlights for the year as recording of the new album was being wrapped up. Ion Vein (2014) Mixing for their long- awaited, self-titled third album began in January and it was released on July 4 in Europe, and July 8 in North America. The album contains 12 songs which include re-mixed/re-mastered versions of the IV v1.0 and IV v2.0 releases. This marked the band's first album since 2003's Reigning Memories. Beyond Tomorrow (re-mastered) plus Latent Fury Demo 1991/unreleased live tracks (2018) In collaboration with Greece's Arkeyn Steel Records, a combination release was put together to celebrate the very early years of guitarist, Chris Lotesto's, beginnings in Latent Fury and the transformation into Ion Vein. The CD release was limited to 500 hand-numbered copies and featured the three studio songs from the classic 1991 cassette demo, titled \\"Latent Fury,\\" along with six unreleased live tracks plus the long out-of-print Ion Vein debut album, Beyond Tomorrow, in re-mastered form. The 12 page glossy booklet features many never before seen photographs/memorabilia and the release was made available for digital download in May 2019.

Notable for his mining rescues, he was killed in a mine accident in 1935. Origins R.T. Slee was born in Sydney NSW on 29 August 1879, the eldest son of Richard Slee (1831‚Äì1912) and Mary Ann Slee (n√©e Thilthorpe). His parents had nine children, of whom five boys and two girls survived to adulthood.Slee Family History, ca.1490-1976, by Max Slee, , p 115 His father, a native of Devon, England, was proprietor of the Slee Stove Works, a foundry at Woolloomooloo, winning medals for his patent fuel stoves from the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales and at the Sydney International Exhibition (1879). Some of those medals are now in the Powerhouse Museum collection.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/search_tags.php?tag=slee Prominent in public affairs, Richard Slee served as an alderman of Rookwood Municipal Council, being elected its first mayor in 1892.http://www.auburn.nsw.gov.au/uploadedFiles/AuburnWeb/About/Mayors%20-%20List%20of.pdf He also supported many charities, including the NSW Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute, of which he was made a life member. Early Mining Career Educated in Sydney, Richard Thilthorpe Slee graduated Bachelor of Engineering from Sydney University in 1901.http://calendararchive.usyd.edu.au/Calendar/1934/PDF/1934%20-%200775.pdf Shortly afterwards, in 1902, he joined BHP. In 1905 he was admitted as a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining Engineers.Advertiser newspaper, 28 January 1905, p 5 His first position was assistant surveyor at Broken Hill, two years later being appointed Assistant Underground Manager, and then Underground Manager in 1911.Richard Thilthorpe Slee, 1926. His younger brother, John Thilthorpe Slee, served in the Boer War.http://members.pcug.org.au/~croe/ozb/oz_boer_more.cgi?record=22357 Another younger brother, Arthur Thilthorpe Slee, wounded at Gallipoli in 1915, was killed in action at Pozieres, France in August 1916. His youngest brother, Frank Thilthorpe Slee, served on the Western Front, in 1917 being awarded the Military Medal for bravery. Although wounded in action, Frank survived the war. General Manager, BHP Broken Hill Owing to a strike in 1919 that brought about a shut down at Broken Hill, Richard Slee was transferred to the booming BHP steelworks at Newcastle for about 12 months. In 1921 he returned, where he succeeded Edward James Horwood as General Manager of BHP mining operations at Broken Hill, a position he occupied until his death. In this capacity, his close associates included Essington Lewis (1881‚Äì1961) who, when the City of Whyalla was being established by BHP., honoured him in the naming of Slee Street.Whyalla Street Names Richard Slee was a member of the Geological Sub-Committee of the Scientific Society of Broken Hill, and was instrumental in the discovery of a new mineral, bernalite, Fe(OH)3, though he never knew of this achievement. Around 1921 he noticed a strange mineral in the upper level workings of the BHP mine. Containing dark green octahedral crystals on concretionary goethite and coronadite, he passed specimens on to the noted geologist Frank Leslie Stillwell (1888‚Äì1963) for investigation. In 1927 Stillwell incorrectly concluded they were known minerals. The specimens remained unnoticed in the Department of Geology at the University of Melbourne until 1990 when they were re-examined by scientists. It was then realised they were a new and unknown mineral, being named bernalite in honour of eminent crystallographer and science historian John Desmond Bernal (1901‚Äì1971).http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM78/AM78_827.pdf Tall and slim, with a reserved but efficient demeanour, R.T. Slee was one of the most highly respected managers of the mines at Broken Hill. Although prominent in the Mining Managers‚Äô Association, he was also well regarded by his employees and the unions for the consideration he gave to them. Mining Rescues Slee had much experience in fighting outbreaks of fire in underground workings. This knowledge gained him such a wide reputation that other companies sought his services in times of these emergencies. Well known for his bravery, he was involved in many gallant mining rescues at Broken Hill.Proprietary Mine cave- in, Melbourne Argus 31 October 1912 p 13, and Advertiser 1 November 1912, p 9 Among the more notable were the Central Mine fire, the Block 14 fire (in which he received an award from the Royal Humane Society)Advertiser newspaper, 18 July 1906, p 6 and the Block 13 fire in 1916. In this fire, with another, Richard Slee rescued two men overcome by gas, even though nearby workmen and miners considered the risk too great and refused to go to their assistance.Melbourne Argus, 29 April 1916, p 17 Accidental Death It was said of him, \\"He would never ask a man to do a thing he would not do himself.\\" On 18 October 1935, with three other mine employees, he descended a well in Sulphide Street to clear a blocked bore pipe that pumped away seepage emanating from the BHP mine workings. This was not an operation a General Manager would normally attend to, but Richard Slee would not send his men into such a situation without helping them. The four men were overcome by foul air and, despite a desperate rescue operation, all four died of accidental asphyxiation.Barrier Miner newspaper, 19 Oct 1935, pp 2-3 A resident of Broken Hill for 36 years, and a prominent citizen, he was a member of many community and business organizations. Aged 56 at the time of his death, Richard Slee was buried in the Broken Hill Cemetery. He married at Broken Hill in 1905 to Emily Moyle (1880‚Äì1963) and they had three children: Richard Mervyn (1906), Gladys Thilthorpe (1908) and Valerie Winifred (1920).Slee Family History, ca.1490-1976, by Max Slee, , p 115 Following his tragic death, his family moved to Adelaide, SA.

Biography  Diggles was born in Liverpool, Lancashire and married Eliza Bradley in 1839, with whom he had two daughters and a son. In 1853 he migrated with his family to Australia, living for a year in Sydney before settling in Brisbane, Queensland, where he taught music and drawing as well as tuning and repairing musical instruments. His wife died in August 1857 and he subsequently married Albina Birkett in January 1858, with whom he had two sons.Marks (1972). Diggles was well known in Brisbane; he was a founder of the Brisbane Choral Society in 1859 and the Brisbane Philharmonic Society in 1861, and was a familiar accompanist at concerts and church services. In 1877 he was given a grand benefit concert by the musicians of the city, and called \\"the father of music in Brisbane\\". A religious man, he had joined the New Jerusalem Church in 1846 and served as its leader in Brisbane. He was also a Freemason. Diggles was a founder of the Queensland Philosophical Society, the predecessor of the Royal Society of Queensland, and helped establish the Queensland Museum, which the society instigated in 1862. He served as the Queensland representative on the 1871/72 solar eclipse expedition to Cape Sidmouth, Far North Queensland, and reported on the birds, insects and scenery there to the Philosophical Society.Whittell (1954). Diggles is best known for his authorship of a major ornithological work which was never completely published because of financial problems. He and his niece Rowena Birkett produced some 325 hand-coloured plates of some 600 Australian birds for a work titled The Ornithology of Australia, of which three volumes were published from 1865 to 1870.

Thoresen (born ) is a psychologist on the faculty of Stanford University. Since 2005, he has also been a Senior Fellow at Santa Clara University.  Education and academic career  Many events and achievements in Thoresen's career as a psychologist were described in a profile published in 2009 in The Counseling Psychologist (CP), as part of its \\"Legacies and Traditions\\" series. Alex H. S. Harris (2009). Carl Thoresen: The evolving pioneer. The Counseling Psychologist, v37, n2, 275-295. . Thoresen graduated with a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in history (1955), later receiving his MA (Counseling, 1960) and PhD (Psychological Studies, Counseling Psychology, 1964) from Stanford University. After a brief period as an Assistant Professor of Counseling at Michigan State (1965‚Äì1967), he returned to Stanford as Assistant Professor of Education (1967). From 1975 until 2000 he served as Professor of Education, and by Courtesy, Psychology, and Psychiatry. Since 2000, he has held the same title with emeritus status. Since 2005, he has also been a Senior Fellow at the Spirituality and Health Institute at Santa Clara University. According to his CP profile, he was also: *President, Counseling & Human Development, American Educational Research Association (1974‚Äì1976). *President of the Division of Counseling Psychology, American Psychological Association (1978‚Äì1979). *Founder and Elected Chair, American Psychological Association, Counseling Health Psychology Section, Division 17 (1997‚Äì1999). *Founder and Chair, Society of Behavioral Medicine, Spirituality and Health Special Interest Group (2000-). Thoresen has been awarded honorary doctorates by the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden (1986),http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/ and by the National University of Ireland (Literature, 2004). Text of the Introductory Address Delivered by Professor Eleanor O'Leary. Accessed 6 Nov 2009. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973. He is an elected Fellow of several major organisations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1982-), the American Psychological Association (1972-) and the Society of Behavioural Medicine (1986-). His professional publications number more than 200.  Research and influence  According to the CP interview, Thoresen's \\"scholarly work, professional service, teaching, and mentorship have motivated many counseling psychologists to radically expand their areas of inquiry. He was among the first to focus counseling on observable behaviors and to apply psychological science and interventions to physical problems in medical settings. More recently, he has pioneered the study of the interface between spirituality and health\\" (p. 275). Beginning in 1973, Thoresen collaborated with well-known cardiologist Meyer Friedman. They worked together on the Recurrent Coronary Prevention Project, which followed 1013 heart attack survivors for 4.5 years to determine effects from altering their coronary-prone (type A) behavior patterns. Thoresen was responsible \\"to help design and direct the psychological treatment program based on a behavioral self-control perspective\\" (p. 282). Results indicated that behavioral counseling reduced rates of recurrence to 13% (from 21% or higher). After the first year, those receiving behavioral counseling also experienced significantly lower rates of death. The study showed, \\"for the first time, within a controlled experimental design, that altering type A behavior reduces cardiac morbidity and mortality in post infarction patients\\" (p. 653).Meyer Friedman, Carl E.

Hasan was a United States Army Medical Corps psychiatrist who admitted to the shootings at his court-martial in August 2013. A jury panel of 13 officers convicted him of 13 counts of premeditated murder, 32 counts of attempted murder, and unanimously recommended he be dismissed from the service and sentenced to death. Hasan is incarcerated at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas awaiting execution. During the six years that Hasan was an intern and resident at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, colleagues and superiors were concerned about his job performance and comments. Hasan was not married at the time and was being described as socially isolated, stressed by his work with soldiers, and upset about their accounts of warfare. Two days before the shooting, which occurred less than a month before he was due to deploy to Afghanistan, Hasan gave away many of his belongings to a neighbor. Prior to the shooting, Hasan had expressed critical views described by colleagues as \\"anti-American\\". An investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded that his e-mails with the late Imam Anwar al- Awlaki were related to his authorized professional research and that he was not a threat. The FBI, Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. Senate all conducted investigations after the shootings. The DoD classified the events as \\"workplace violence\\", pending prosecution of Hasan in a court-martial. The Senate released a report describing the mass shooting as \\"the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001\\". The decision by the Army not to charge Hasan with terrorism is controversial. Early life Hasan was born in Arlington County, Virginia at Virginia Hospital Center to American parents of Palestinian descent, having immigrated years prior from al-Bireh, a city located in the West Bank near Jerusalem. Raised in the Muslim faith with his two younger brothers, he attended Wakefield High School in Arlington for his freshman year in 1985. His family moved to Roanoke in 1986, to join his father who moved to the city a year prior to set up what would become a number of successful family-owned businesses which included a market, restaurant and olive bar. He attended William Fleming High School in Roanoke, Virginia graduating from high school in 1988. Their father died in 1998 at the age of 51 and their mother, known as Nora by the community, passed away in 2001 at the age of 49. As adults, one brother continues to live in Virginia while the other has since moved to Jerusalem. Military service, higher education and medical career Hasan enlisted in the United States Army in 1988, after graduating from high school. He attended college during this time, earning an Associate's degree in science from Virginia Western Community College in 1992. In 1995 he graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in biochemistry. He completed both of these programs with Latin honors. He was commissioned as an officer in the Army Medical Department in 1997 and enrolled at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) in Bethesda, Maryland. Hasan's performance was marginal while enrolled at USUHS. He was on academic probation during much of the six years it took him to complete the four-year curriculum and graduate from medical school.https://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/01/12/fort.hood.suspect/index.html Upon graduation from USUHS in 2003, Hasan completed his internship and residency in psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He completed his psychiatry training with a two-year fellowship in disaster & preventive psychiatry, earning a master‚Äôs degree in public health. During his training at Walter Reed, he received counseling and extra supervision. According to The Washington Post, Hasan made a presentation titled \\"The Quranic World View as It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military\\" during his senior year of residency at Walter Reed, which was not well received by some attendees. He suggested that the Department of Defense \\"should allow Muslims Soldiers the option of being released as \\"Conscientious objectors\\" to increase troop morale and decrease adverse events.\\" On a previous slide he explained that \\"adverse events\\" could be refusal to deploy, espionage, or killing of fellow soldiers. Retired Colonel Terry Lee, who had worked with Hasan, later recalled\\"Major Nidal Malik Hasan: Soldiers' psychiatrist who heard front-line stories\\", Ewen MacAskill, The Guardian, November 6, 2009. that the fatal shooting of two recruiters in Little Rock, Arkansas greatly affected Hasan. The suspect Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad later claimed to be an Al Qaeda terrorist. He was charged with murder. Lee told Fox News that Hasan made \\"outlandish\\" statements against the American military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, that \\"the Muslims should stand up and fight against the aggressor\\", referring to the United States. Hasan reportedly became more agitated, and frequently argued with soldiers. He expressed hope that President Barack Obama would withdraw troops.Officials Begin Putting Shooting Pieces Together, NPR, November 6, 2009. In May 2009, Hasan was promoted from captain to major. In July 2009, Hasan was transferred to Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas, moving into an undesirable area of the city of Killeen. Two weeks later he purchased an FN Herstal 5.7 millimeter gun at a weapons store nearby. Prior to his transfer he received a poor performance evaluation from supervisors and medical faculty.BBC News, Profile: Major Nidal Malik Hasan, October 12, 2010. Despite concerns, his former army boss, Lt. Col Ben Phillips, graded his performance as \\"outstanding\\", as revealed when Phillips was cross-examined during Hasan's trial. Slide 49/50 of The Quranic World View As It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military, a presentation made by Hasan during a symposium of U.S. Army physicians at Walter Reed Army Medical Center His cousin, Nader Hasan, a Virginia attorney, disputed that Hasan had ever been \\"disenchanted with the military,\\" but that he dreaded war after counseling soldiers who had returned with post-traumatic stress disorder. He was \\"mortified by the idea\\" of deploying after having been told on a \\"daily basis the horrors they saw over there\\". Nader also stated that Hasan had been harassed by his fellow soldiers. \\"He hired a military attorney to try to have the issue resolved, pay back the government, to get out of the military. He was at the end of trying everything.\\" Hasan's aunt also said that Hasan sought discharge because of harassment relating to his Islamic faith. However, an army spokesman did not confirm the relatives' statements; with the deputy director of the American Muslim Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs Council stating that the reported harassment was \\"inconsistent\\" with their records. His uncle Rafiq Hamad, who lives in Ramallah in the West Bank, said Hasan was a gentle and quiet man who fainted while observing childbirth, which was why he chose psychiatry. He was deeply sensitive and mourned a pet bird for months after it died. Also near Ramallah, cousin Mohammed Hasan said that \\"because he's a Muslim he didn't want to go to Afghanistan or Iraq and he didn't want to expose himself to violence and death\\". Mohammed stated his cousin was a \\"pleasant young man\\" who was happy to have graduated and to be joining the army after his uncle and cousins had also served. They never talked about politics, but Hasan had complained that \\"he was being treated like a Muslim, like an Arab, rather than an American; he was being discriminated against.\\"James Hider and Philippe Naughton, \\"Fort Hood gunman Major Nidal Hasan had been trying to leave 'anti- Muslim' Army\\", Times Online, November 6, 2009. In August 2009, according to a Killeen, Texas police report, someone vandalized Hasan's automobile with a key; repair was estimated at $1000. Police charged a soldier, who a neighbor said vandalized the vehicle because of Hasan's religion. According to military records, Hasan was unmarried. However, David Cook, a former neighbor, stated that in 1997 Hasan had two sons living with him and attending local schools. Cook said, \\"As far as I know, he was a single father. I never saw a wife.\\" Military awards and decorations Hasan received the Army Service Ribbon as a private in 1988 after completing Advanced Individual Training (AIT), the National Defense Service Medal twice for service during the time periods of the Persian Gulf War and the War on Terror, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal for support service during the War on Terror. Religious and ideological beliefs According to one of his cousins, Hasan was a practicing Muslim who became more devout after early deaths of his parents. His cousin did not recall him ever expressing any radical or anti-American views, and family also described Hasan as a peaceful person, and a good American. One of his cousins said Hasan turned against the wars after hearing the stories of soldiers whom he treated in therapy following their return from Afghanistan and Iraq. His aunt said that he did not tell the family he was being deployed to Afghanistan. The late Anwar al-Awlaki in 2008, with whom Hasan communicated in the months prior to the shootings In May 2001, Hasan attended the Dar al- Hijrah mosque in the Falls Church area for the funeral of his mother and occasionally after that, generally attended a mosque in Silver Spring, Maryland, close to where he lived, worked, and was well known by the Imam over a period of ten years. Faizul Khan, the former Imam of the Silver Spring mosque where Hasan prayed several times a week, said he was \\"a reserved guy with a nice personality. We discussed religious matters. Politics were never brought up. He was a fairly devout Muslim.\\" Khan said Hasan often expressed his wish to get married, and the Imam said, \\"I got the impression that he was a committed soldier.\\" Air Force Lt. Col. Dr. Val Finnell, a graduate school classmate in the Master's in Public Health program, said that in a class on environmental health, Hasan's project dealt with \\"whether the war on terror is a war against Islam\\" and the effect on Muslims in the military, which Finnell thought was strange. According to Colonel Terry Lee, since retired, \\"He [Hasan] said 'maybe Muslims should stand up and fight against the aggressor'. At first we thought he meant help the armed forces, but apparently that wasn't the case. Other times he would make comments we shouldn't be in the war in the first place.\\" E-Mail Exchanges with Anwar Al-Awlaki From January 2001 to 2002, Anwar al-Awlaki was the Imam of the Dar al-Hijrah mosque; he was then considered a moderate. Also serving as the Muslim chaplain at George Washington University, he was frequently invited to speak about Islam to audiences in Washington, DC and to members of Congress and the government. Hasan reportedly has deep respect for al-Awlaki's teachings. Six months prior to the shooting, in December of 2008, federal intelligence officials captured a series of e-mail exchanges between Al-Awlaki, who officials had by now deemed a \\"radical cleric\\", and Hasan. However, it was determined that the e-mails were of a religious nature, and did not contain any elements of militancy nor any concerning subject matter. Counter-terrorism specialists for the FBI who reviewed the e-mails at the time stated that \\"they were consistent with authorized research Major Hasan was conducting.\\"Shane, Scott and Dao, James; Tangle of Clues About Suspect at Fort Hood, New York Times, November 14, 2009. Retrieved November 14, 2009.Ross, Brian, and Schwartz, Rhonda, \\"Major Hasan's E-Mail: 'I Can't Wait to Join You' in Afterlife; American Official Says Accused Shooter Asked Radical Cleric When Is Jihad Appropriate?\\", ABC News, November 19, 2009. Retrieved November 19, 2009.. The e-mails contained general questions about spiritual guidance with regard to conflicts between Islam and military service, and officials judged them to be consistent with his legitimate mental health research about Muslims in the armed services. After the shootings, the Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Hider Shaea interviewed al-Awlaki in November 2009 about their exchanges, and later spoke to a Washington Post reporter. According to Shaea, Al-Awlaki said he \\"neither ordered nor pressured ... Hasan to harm Americans\\". Al-Awlaki said Hasan first e-mailed him on December 17, 2008, introducing himself by writing: \\"Do you remember me? I used to pray with you at the Virginia mosque.\\" According to Al-Awlaki, Hasan said he had become a devout Muslim around the time the Imam was preaching at Dar al-Hijrah in 2001 and 2002.

Some investigators believe that Hasan's contacts with al-Awlaki are what pushed him toward violence at a time when he was suffering depression and stress. Prior to the Fort Hood shooting Internet Activity Law enforcement officials monitoring Islamic websites believe that Hasan, under an alias similar to his legal name, made posts discussing suicide bombings in May of 2009, though authorities did not at the time link the posts directly to Hasan. The postings, made in the name \\"NidalHasan\\", likened a suicide bomber to a soldier who throws himself on a grenade to save his colleagues, and sacrifices his life for a \\"more noble cause\\". ABC News reported that after the fact, unnamed officials were allegedly aware that Hasan had attempted to contact Al Qaeda, and stated to the media outlet that Hasan had \\"more unexplained connections to people being tracked by the FBI\\" than just Anwar al-Awlaki.Martha Raddatz, Brian ross, Mary-Rose Abraham, Rehab El-Buri, Senior Official: More Hasan Ties to People Under Investigation by FBI, November 10, 2009.

According to investigators, the acronym \\"SoA\\" is commonly used on jihadist websites as an acronym for \\"Soldier of Allah\\" or \\"Servant of Allah.\\" SWT is commonly used by Muslims to mean \\"subhanahu wa ta'ala\\" (Glory to God). A review of Hasan's computer and his multiple e-mail accounts revealed visits to websites espousing radical Islamist ideas, according to an unnamed senior law enforcement official. Emails to Superiors Hasan expressed concern about the actions of some of the soldiers he was evaluating as a military psychiatrist. Days before he opened fire at Fort Hood in 2009, Hasan asked his supervisors and Army legal advisers how to handle reports of soldier's deeds in Afghanistan and Iraq that disturbed him.

Hasan told a local store owner that he was stressed about his imminent deployment to Afghanistan since he might have to fight or kill fellow Muslims.\\"Major Nidal Malik Hasan's Jihad warning signs ignored by politically correct military ‚Äì Fort Hood\\", CNN, November 6, 2009. According to Jeff Sadoski, spokesperson of U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, \\"Hasan was upset about his deployment\\". Hasan gave away furniture from his home on the morning of the shooting, saying he was going to be deployed on Friday. He also handed out copies of the Quran. Kamran Pasha wrote about a Muslim officer at Fort Hood who said he prayed with Hasan on the day of the Fort Hood shooting, and that Hasan \\"appeared relaxed and not in any way troubled or nervous\\". This officer believed that the shootings may have been motivated by religious radicalism. Fort Hood shooting First responders and soldiers transport a fellow soldier who was wounded in the Fort Hood shooting On November 5, 2009, Hasan reportedly shouted \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" (the phrase literally means \\"God is the greatest\\"), and opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood, located in Killeen, Texas, killing 13 people and wounding over 30 others in the worst shooting ever to take place on an American military base.

News reports on November 7, 2009, indicated that he was in a coma. On November 9, hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell announced that Hasan had regained consciousness, and been able to talk since he was taken off a ventilator on November 7. On November 13, Hasan's attorney, John Galligan, announced that Hasan was paralyzed from the waist down from the bullet wounds to his spine, and would likely never walk again. In mid- December, Galligan indicated that Hasan was moved from intensive care to a private hospital room, yet still remained under guard while recovering.

Mulligan had served as the lead prosecutor on the Hasan Akbar case, in which a soldier was sentenced to death for the murder of two officers. John P. Galligan, a retired Army JAG colonel, initially represented Hasan. On November 21, in a hearing held in Hasan's hospital room, a military magistrate ruled that there was probable cause that Hasan committed the shooting spree at Fort Hood, and ordered him to pretrial confinement until his court-martial. Hasan remained in intensive care in accordance with the magistrate's order. On November 23, Galligan said that Hasan would likely plead not guilty to the charges against him and may use an insanity defense at his court-martial. Army officials initially stated that doctors would evaluate Hasan by mid-January 2010 to determine his competency to stand trial as well as his mental state at the time of the shooting, but delayed the exam on request from Galligan until after the Article 32 hearing. The Army imposed restrictions on Hasan that he speak only in English on the phone or with visitors unless an interpreter was present. Hasan was moved from Brooke Army Medical Center to the Bell County Jail in Belton, Texas, on April 9, 2010. Fort Hood negotiated a renewable $207,000 contract with Bell County in March to house Hasan for six months. Galligan announced that the Army officers prosecuting the case would seek the death penalty, stating, \\"It is the first 'formal notice' but, of course, it has been a virtual given from the start. In short, the Army has been pursuing death from the git-go.\\" The prosecutors filed a memo on April 28, 2010, stating that the \\"aggravating factor\\" necessary for pursuit of the death penalty will be satisfied if Hasan is found guilty of more than one murder. The decision to seek the death penalty followed the Article 32 hearing. On September 15, 2010, Hasan's attorney stated he intended to seek a closed court hearing during those proceedings. On October 12, 2010, Hasan was due to appear for his first broad military hearing into the attack. The hearing, formally called an Article 32 proceeding, akin to a grand jury hearing but open to the public, was expected to span four to six weeks. The hearing, designed to help the top Army commander at Ft. Hood determine whether there was enough evidence to court-martial Hasan, was scheduled to begin calling witnesses but was delayed by scheduling and procedural disputes. The hearing proceeded on October 14 with witness testimonies from soldiers who survived the shootings. On November 15, the military hearing ended when Galligan declined to offer a defense case, on the grounds that the White House and Defense Department refused to hand over documents he requested pertaining to an intelligence review of the shootings. Neither the defense nor prosecution offered to deliver a closing argument. On November 18, Colonel James L. Pohl, who served as the investigating officer for the Article 32 hearing, recommended that Hasan be court-martialed and face the death penalty. His recommendation was forwarded to another U.S. Army Colonel at Fort Hood, who, after filing his own report, presented his recommendation to the post commander. The post commander made the final decision on whether Hasan would face a trial and the death penalty. On July 6, 2011, the Fort Hood post commander referred the case to a general court- martial, authorized to consider the death penalty. On July 27, 2011, Fort Hood Chief Circuit Judge Colonel Gregory Gross set a March 5, 2012, trial date. Hasan declined to enter any plea and Judge Gross granted a request by Hasan's attorneys to defer the plea to an unspecified date. Hasan notified Gross that he had released John Galligan, the civilian attorney who had been his lead attorney in previous court appearances, choosing to be represented by three military lawyers. On February 2, 2012, a military judge delayed trial until June 12, 2012. Lt.Col. Kris Poppe, Hasan's lead attorney, said the request to delay the trial was \\"purely a matter of necessity of adequate time for pretrial preparation\\". On April 10, 2012, Hasan's lawyers requested another continuance to move the trial start date from June to late October in order to review the large volume of paperwork and evidence and interview more witnesses. Gross agreed to take the request under advisement. Judge Gross denied a defense motion seeking a Defense Initiated Victim Outreach specialist to testify, Fort Hood officials said. The new program is intended to help the defense respond to the needs of survivors and victims' families and possibly change their attitudes if they support the death penalty. Gross also denied a defense request to force prosecutors to provide notes from meetings and conversations with President Barack Obama, the defense secretary and other high-ranking government officials after the November 5, 2009, shootings. Defense attorneys had argued they want to determine if anything was discussed that may have unlawfully influenced Hasan's chain of command to prosecute him. On April 18, 2012, Judge Gross granted in part the defense motion for a continuance, rescheduling the trial for August 20, 2012. In July 2012, having previously instructed Hasan to follow army regulations and shave his beard grown during the past several months, the judge found Hasan in contempt of court and fined him. He was fined once more for retaining his beard, and was warned by Judge Colonel Gregory Gross that he could be forcibly shaved prior to his court-martial. On August 15, Hasan was scheduled to enter pleas to the charges brought against him before the beginning of the court-martial; he would not be allowed to plead guilty for the premeditated murder charges as the prosecution is pursuing the death penalty in his case. The hearing and the preceding court-martial was delayed by Hasan's objections to being shaved against his will, and his appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces regarding the matter; through his attorneys, Hasan said that his beard is part of his religious beliefs. The prosecutors argued that Hasan was simply trying to delay his trial. On August 27, the Appeals Court announced that the trial could continue, but did not rule whether Hasan could be forcibly shaved nor did they set a new date for the start of the trial. The Appeals Court had rejected previous attempts by Hasan to receive \\"religious accommodation\\" to wear his beard. On September 6, Colonel Gross ruled that Hasan be forcibly shaved after it was determined that the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act did not apply to this case; however, it will not be enforced until all of Hasan's appeals are exhausted. During the September 6 hearing, Hasan twice offered to plead guilty, however U.S. Army rules prohibit the judge from accepting a guilty plea in a death penalty case. Hasan remained incarcerated and in a wheelchair. He continued to receive paychecks, and his medical expenses are paid by the military. On June 3, 2013, a military judge allowed Hasan to represent himself at his upcoming murder trial. His attorneys were to remain on the case but only if he asked for their help. Jury selection was set to start on June 5 and opening arguments were scheduled to begin on July 1. U.S. Army Colonel Tara Osborn ruled on June 14, 2013, that Hasan could not claim as a part of his defense that he was defending the Taliban. In a statement released to Fox News, Hasan justified his actions during the Fort Hood shooting by claiming that the US military was at war with Islam. During the first day of the trial on August 6, Hasan, who was representing himself, admitted that he was the gunman during the Fort Hood shootings in 2009 and stated that the evidence would show that he was the shooter. He also told the panel hearing that he had \\"switched sides\\" and regarded himself as a Mujahideen waging \\"jihad\\" against the United States. By August 7, disagreements between Hasan and his stand-by defense team led Judge Osborn to temporarily suspend the proceedings. Hasan's defense attorneys were concerned that Hasan was trying to help prosecutors achieve a death sentence. Since the prosecution had sought the death penalty, his defense team sought to prevent this. On August 8, Judge Osborn ruled that Hasan could continue to represent himself during the trial and rejected his standby defense team's requests that they take over Hasan's defense or have their roles reduced. The judge also declined the defense lawyers' request that they be removed from the case. On August 9, Hasan allowed two of his three standby defense lawyers‚ÄîLieutenant Colonel Christopher Martin and Major Joseph Marcee‚Äîto seek leave in order to prepare an appeal arguing that the defendant was seeking the death penalty, thus undermining their rules of \\"professional conduct\\". His third attorney Lieutenant Colonel Kris Poppe remained behind to observe the court proceedings. Court proceedings also resumed with the prosecution presenting testimonies from several soldiers who had survived the Fort Hood shooting. By August 14, more than 60 prosecution witnesses had testified and all had identified Hasan as the shooter. Court proceedings were speedy since Hasan raised few objections and declined to cross-examine most of the witnesses. By August 13, prosecutors had shifted to presenting forensic evidence with FBI agents present at the crime scene testifying that they had found so much evidence at the crime scene that they ran out of markers. This evidence included 146 shell casings and six magazines. The New York Times also published remarks by Hasan from a mental health report supplied by the defendant's civil attorney John Galligan. According to these documents, Hasan told medical health experts in 2010 that he \\"would still be a martyr\\" even if he was convicted and executed by the US government. Hasan, acting as his own defense lawyer, had offered to share the report with prosecutors during his court-martial. However, on August 14, Judge Osborn blocked prosecutors from seeing the report. On August 19, she also excluded prosecuting evidence relating to Hasan's early radicalization and evidence which presented the Fort Hood shooting as a \\"copycat\\" based on the actions of Hasan Akbar, a Muslim U.S. Army soldier sentenced to death for attacking fellow soldiers prior to the Iraq War. On August 20, 2013, the prosecution rested its case against Hasan. They had called nearly 90 witnesses over 11 days with the fast pace of proceedings being attributed to Hasan's refusal to cross-examine most of the witnesses. Throughout the proceedings, he only questioned three witnesses. While the defense had been scheduled to present its case on Wednesday, Hasan indicated that he had no plans to call any defense witnesses. Earlier, he had planned to call two defense witnesses: one a mitigation expert in capital murder cases and the other a California professor, specializing in philosophy and religion. Hasan also formally declined to argue that the prosecution had not proven its case. Ultimately, Hasan did not call any witnesses or testify in his own defense and rested his defense on August 21, 2013. On August 22, 2013, Hasan declined to give a closing argument. =Verdict and sentencing= On August 23, 2013, the military jury consisting of nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels, and one major convicted Hasan of all charges, making him eligible for the death penalty. Those deliberations began on August 26, 2013. By August 27, the thirteen-member jury panel heard testimony from 24 victims and family members of those wounded and killed during the 2009 Fort Hood shootings. Throughout the proceedings, Hasan declined to speak in his own defense or question any of the witnesses. He also did not provide any material explaining his decision not to mount a defense throughout the trial and sentencing phases. At the end, Hasan, acting as his own attorney, told the jury panel that the defense had rested its case. Judge Tara Osborn accepted Hasan's decision. In his final statement, lead prosecutor Colonel Mike Mulligan said > [Hasan] can never be a martyr because he has nothing to give ... Do not be > misled; do not be confused; do not be fooled. He is not giving his life. We > are taking his life. This is not his gift to God, it's his debt to society. > He will not now and will not ever be a martyr. The jury panel then reconvened to decide on sentencing. On August 28, 2013, the jury panel recommended Hasan be sentenced to death. The panel also recommended Hasan forfeit his military pay and be dismissed from the Army, a separation for officers carrying the same consequences as a dishonorable discharge.

The evening after the attack, Revolution Muslim posted support for Hasan on its website, one of the few American sites to do so. In the video RM described American soldiers in the video as \\"slain terrorists in the eternal hellfire\\". National American Muslim organizations strongly condemned the group. A statement issued by the Ansar Al-Mujahideen Network, another extremist group, on November 24, 2009, cited Hasan as a role model. It congratulated him for his \\"brave and heroic deed\\" for standing up to the \\"modern Zionist-Christian Crusades\\" against the Muslim community. =Retrospective analyses= A military activist, Selena Coppa, said: \\"This man was a psychiatrist and was working with other psychiatrists every day and they failed to notice how deeply disturbed someone right in their midst was.\\" Philip Sherwell and Alex Spillius, reporters for The Telegraph, wrote, \\"many of the characteristics attributed to Hasan by acquaintances‚Äîwithdrawn, unassuming, brooding, socially awkward and never known to have had a girlfriend‚Äîhave also applied to other mass murderers.\\" Hasan's perceived beliefs were also a cause for concern among some of his peers. According to an unnamed source, Hasan was disciplined for \\"proselytizing about his Muslim faith with patients and colleagues\\", while at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS); The Telegraph reported an incident in which some attendees felt one of his lectures, expected to be of a medical nature, became a diatribe against \\"infidels\\".

He at least should have been confronted about these beliefs, told to cease and desist, and to shape up or ship out.\\" Before the contents of the e-mails were revealed, Jarret Brachman, a scholar of terrorism, said that Hasan's contacts with al-Awlaki should have raised \\"huge red flags\\". According to Brachman, al-Awlaki is a major influence internationally on English-speaking jihadists.Brachman, Jarret, and host Norris, Michelle, \\"All Things Considered: Expert Discusses Ties Between Hasan, Radical Imam\\", NPR, November 10, 2009. Retrieved November 12, 2009 The Dallas Morning News reported on November 17 that ABC News, citing anonymous sources, reported that investigators suspect that the shootings were triggered by the refusal of Hasan's superiors to process his requests that sought to have some of his patients prosecuted for war crimes based on statements they made during psychiatric sessions with him. Dallas attorney Patrick McLain, a former Marine, opined that Hasan may have been legally justified in reporting what patients disclosed, but that it was impossible to be sure without knowing exactly what was said. Some fellow psychiatrists had complained to superiors that Hasan's requests violated physician‚Äìpatient privilege. Shortly after the shooting, General George Casey, Chief of Staff of the Army, said that the FBI Director Robert Mueller appointed William Webster, a former director of the FBI, to conduct an independent review of the bureau's handling of investigations related to Hasan and whether it missed signs of an attack.

The November 23 cover of the European and U.S. editions of Time magazine featured a photograph of Hasan, with the title \\"Terrorist?\\" over his eyes. Nancy Gibbs reported the cover story: \\"Hasan matched the classic model of the lone, strange, crazy killer: the quiet and gentle man who formed few close human attachments.\\" She noted, \\"Hasan's motives were mixed enough that everyone with an agenda could find markers in the trail he left.\\" Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism scholar and Georgetown University professor, told Gibbs that \\"I used to argue it was only terrorism if it were part of some identifiable, organized conspiracy ... the nature of terrorism is changing, and Major Hasan may be an example of that\\".\\"The Fort Hood Killer: Terrified ... or Terrorist?\\".

Samuelson, \\"Fort Hood suspect: Portrait of a terrorist?\\", Christian Science Monitor, November 9, 2009. On November 14, The New York Times asked: \\"Was Major Hasan a terrorist, driven by religious extremism to attack fellow soldiers he had come to see as the enemy? Was he a troubled loner, a misfit who cracked when ordered sent to a war zone whose gruesome casualties he had spent the last six years caring for? Or was he both?\\" The reporters write, \\"Major Hasan may be the latest example of an increasingly common type of terrorist, one who has been self-radicalized with the help of the Internet and who wreaks havoc without support from overseas networks and without having to cross a border to reach his target.\\" =In popular culture= Israeli creator and singer Eric Berman, in his album \\"oh pathetic ridiculous heart\\", wrote a song called \\"not a simple story\\" that followed the background of the massacre. The song describes Hassan's biography and his personal deterioration that lead him to conduct the massacre. Prison life Following his conviction and sentencing, Nidal Hasan was incarcerated at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas to await execution. According to Chris Haug, Fort Hood's Chief of Media Relations, Hasan was also stripped of his rank and dismissed from the US Army. Hasan would only be referred to as \\"Inmate Nidal Hasan\\" going forward. On September 5, 2013, it was reported that Hasan had his beard forcibly shaved. Fort Leavenworth authorities justified their decision by citing that Hasan would be subject to Army regulations even though he had been dismissed from the Army and forfeited all pay and allowances. Despite Army regulations banning personnel from having facial hair, Hasan had begun growing a beard following the Fort Hood Shooting in 2009 by citing his religious beliefs. Although no new photos of Hasan have been released since his incarceration, military authorities have confirmed that a video recording of the forced shaving exists, as per military regulations. In response, John Galligan, Hasan's former civilian lawyer, had planned to sue the military for violating his religious beliefs. Galligan argued that a military council in 2012 had allowed Hasan to keep his beard for the duration of the trial and dismissed the Army's actions as vindictive. On August 28, 2014, his attorney said Hasan had written a letter to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then head of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In the letter, Hasan requested to be made a citizen of the Islamic State and included his signature and the abbreviation SoA (Soldier of Allah).

Natural selection is not a perfect process; if an organism is ‚Äúfit enough‚Äù to survive a particular environment and reproduce, its genes are passed on to the next generation.Thanukos, A. 2008. \\"Views from understanding evolution: parasites and pathogens take the leap.\\" Evolution:Education and Outreach 1:25-28 Some of these genes may increase an organism's fitness while some may even be slightly disadvantageous. This seeming paradox is the origin of evolutionary baggage, which is the collectively inherited traits that evolved in a different environment from the present. Sickle-cell and malaria As a recessive gene, Sickle-cell disease is only present if homozygous, with no dominant gene to beat them out. Sickle- cell disease, originating in people living in tropical areas where malaria is prevalent, is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by rigid, sickle- shaped red blood cells.. The unusual shape and rigidity of these altered red blood cells reduces a cell's ability to effectively travel with regular blood flow, occasionally blocking veins and preventing proper blood flow. Life expectancy is shortened for people with sickle-cell disease, though modern medicine has significantly lengthened the life expectancy of someone with this disease. As detrimental the effects of sickle-cell disease seem, it also offers an unforeseen benefit; humans with the sickle-cell gene show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria, as the abnormal shape of blood cells caused by the disease hinder the malaria parasite's ability to invade and replicate within these cells.Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM (September 2009). \\"The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities\\". J. Clin. Invest.119 (9): 2496‚Äì505. It is possible to have the sickle-cell allele, but not have the disease, for example if heterozygous. Malaria, a mosquito- borne infectious disease of humans and other animals, is a potentially deadly disease that causes fever, fatigue, nausea, muscular pain, coughing, and, in extreme cases, coma and death. Malaria is caused by parasitic protozoans transferred through mosquito saliva into a person's circulatory system, where they travel to the liver to mature. Though eliminated in the U.S., there were an estimated 219 million documented cases of malaria in 2010 according to the World Health Organization.Nayyar GML, Breman JG, Newton PN, Herrington J (2012). \\"Poor-quality antimalarial drugs in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa\\".Lancet Infectious Diseases 12 (6): 488‚Äì96. The correlation between sickle-cell disease and malaria is a double-edged sword. Having a sickle-cell allele does limit the life expectancy of a person, however, the presence of sickle-cell genes reduces the detrimental effects of malaria should it be contracted. Natural selection allowed for the spreading of the sickle-cell gene in areas of high numbers of mosquitoes carrying malaria; those that weren't as susceptible to malaria were much more likely to live than those that were. Because malaria is not as prevalent as it once was, the benefits of sickle-cell have since eroded, leaving behind the detrimental effects of the disease.

A permit is required to engage in any of these activities. One major outcome of the act was the creation of Federal Migratory Bird Sanctuaries (MBSs).  Implementation in the United States  Under United States Code Title 16, Chapter 7, Subchapter II, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 is the United States legislation implementing the convention between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada). It replaced the Weeks-McLean Act, which had become effective in 1913. The United States subsequently entered into similar agreements with four other nations (Canada, Mexico, Japan and Russia) to protect migratory birds. The statute makes it unlawful to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill or sell birds listed therein (\\"migratory birds\\"). The statute does not discriminate between live or dead birds and also grants full protection to any bird parts including feathers, eggs and nests.

Writing Nelson writes about the intersections of science, technology, medicine and inequality.Alondra Nelson, Columbia University\\"Scholars Question the Image of the Internet as a Race-Free Utopia\\", Chronicle of Higher Education, September 28, 2001. Named one of \\"13 Notable Blacks In Technology\\" by Black Voices,\\"13 Notable Blacks In Technology\\", Black Voices she established the Afrofuturism on-line community in 1998 and edited an eponymous special issue of the journal Social Text in 2002.John Pfeiffer, Review of Alondra Nelson, guest ed. Social Text 71: Afrofuturism. Utopian Studies 14:1 (2003): 240-43. She is among a small group of social theorists of Afrofuturism. Particularly, her essay \\"Future Texts\\" lends insight onto the inequitable access to technologies. Nelson explained Afrofuturism as a way of looking at the subject position of black people that covers themes of alienation and aspirations for a better future. Additionally, Nelson notes that discussions around race, access, and technology often bolster uncritical claims about the \\"digital divide.\\" The digital-divide framing, she argues, may overemphasize the role of access to technology in creating inequality as opposed to other drivers of inequality. Noting the racial stereotyping work of the \\"digital divide\\" concept, she writes, \\"Blackness gets constructed as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress.\\" She is co-editor with Keith Wailoo and Catherine Lee of Genetics and the Unsettled Past: The Collision of DNA, Race, and History. Nelson is also co-editor, with Thuy Linh N. Tu, of Technicolor: Race, Technology and Everyday Life, one of the first scholarly works to examine the racial politics of contemporary technoculture.Estrada,Sheryl. \\"What Does it Mean to be Hi-Tech Anyway?\\", Black Issues Book Review, 1 January 2002.

Kirkus Reviews described The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation After the Genome, Nelson's book about the uses of genetic ancestry testing in Black communities, as a \\"meticulously detailed\\" work that \\"adds another chapter to the somber history of injustice toward African- Americans, but... one in which science is enriching lives by forging new identities and connections to ancestral homelands.\\" Writer Isabel Wilkerson hailed the book as the work of \\"one of this generation's most gifted scholars.\\"The Social Life of DNA was named a finalist for the 2017 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Nonfiction and a Favorite Book of 2016 by The Wall Street Journal.

The first American-born bishop to head a European diocese, he was Bishop of Stockholm in Sweden from 1962 to 1976. Early life and priesthood Taylor was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, to Robert and Mary (n√©e Pohl) Taylor. After attending St. Henry‚Äôs Preparatory Seminary in Belleville, he took his vows for the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1934. He continued his studies in Rome, where he attended the Angelicum and the Gregorian. On May 25, 1940, Taylor was ordained to the priesthood in Rome. He earned his Ph.D. at Ottawa University in 1941, with a thesis on the philosophy of John Dewey. Returning to the United States, he taught at the Oblates‚Äô minor seminary in Belleville before serving as superior of Oblate seminaries in Carthage, Missouri (1947-1953) and in Pass Christian, Mississippi (1953-1958). In 1958, Taylor was chosen to lead a mission to revive the Catholic Church in Greenland. He first established a headquarters in the Copenhagen suburb of Herlev and, in 1960, became the first Catholic priest to settle in Greenland since the Reformation. Bishop of Stockholm On July 2, 1962, Taylor was appointed Bishop of Stockholm in Sweden by Pope John XXIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 21 from Archbishop Bruno Heim, with Bishops Jacques Mangers and Fulton J. Sheen serving as co-consecrators, in the Blue Hall of Stockholm City Hall. The event was the first consecration of a Catholic bishop in Sweden since 1531. During his tenure, the estimated number of Catholics in the Diocese of Stockholm (which covers all of Sweden) rose from 27,000 to 75,000, and the number of priests rose from 64 to 97. He also established a priests‚Äô council, a Catholic education commission, and an ecumenical commission. He served as chairman of the Scandinavian Bishops Conference from 1970 to 1973. Taylor attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. He presented Catholic peace activist Tom Cornell with the commemorative medal given to each bishop who participated in the Council, in acknowledgment of \\"the role that the Catholic Peace Fellowship, together with the Catholic Worker, played at the Council ‚Äì the role of invisible Council Father.\\" Later life Following an operation to remove a cerebral tumor, Taylor resigned as Bishop of Stockholm on June 3, 1976. He retired to a nursing home run by the Bridgettines in Djursholm, where he died a few months later on September 9, at the age of 61.

The phrase is probably a shortened form of \\"shut up your mouth\\" or \\"shut your mouth up\\". Its use is generally considered rude and impolite, and may also considered a form of profanity by some. Initial meaning and development Before the twentieth century, the phrase \\"shut up\\" was rarely used as an imperative, and had a different meaning altogether. To say that someone was \\"shut up\\" meant that they were locked up, quarantined, or held prisoner. For example, several passages in the King James Version of the Bible instruct that if a priest determines that a person shows certain symptoms of illness, \\"then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days\\".Leviticus 13:4 (King James Version). This meaning was also used in the sense of closing something, such as a business, and it is also from this use that the longer phrase \\"shut up your mouth\\" likely originated. One source has indicated this: However, Shakespeare's use of the phrase in King Lear is limited to a reference to the shutting of doors at the end of Scene II, with the characters of Regan and Cornwall both advising the King, \\"Shut up your doors\\". The earlier meaning of the phrase, to close something, is widely used in Little Dorrit, but is used in one instance in a manner which foreshadows the modern usage: In another instance in that work, the phrase \\"shut it up\\" is used to indicate the resolution of a matter: The Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang cites an 1858 lecture on slang as noting that \\"when a man... holds his peace, he shuts up.\\"Eric Partridge, The Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang (1973), p. 4797. As early as 1859, use of the shorter phrase was expressly conveyed in a literary work: One 1888 source identifies the phrase by its similarity to Shakespeare's use in Much Ado About Nothing of \\"the Spanish phrase poeat palabr√¢t, 'few words,' which is said to be pretty well the equivalent of our slang phrase 'shut up'\\".Sir Henry Irving, Frank Albert Marshall, Edward Dowden, commentary on The Works of William Shakespeare (1888), p. 252. The usage by Rudyard Kipling appears in his poem \\"The Young British Soldier\\", published in 1892, told in the voice of a seasoned military veteran who says to the fresh troops, \\"Now all you recruities what's drafted to-day,/You shut up your rag-box an' 'ark to my lay\\".Rudyard Kipling, \\"The Young British Soldier\\", in Barrack-Room Ballads (1892). Variations More forceful and sometimes vulgar forms of the phrase may be constructed by the infixation of modifiers, including \\"shut the hell up\\" and \\"shut the fuck up\\".Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J-Z (2006), p. 1444-45. In shut the heck up, heck is substituted for more aggressive modifiers. In instant messenger communications, these are in turn often abbreviated to STHU and STFU, respectively. Similar phrases include \\"hush\\" and \\"shush\\" or \\"hush up\\" and \\"shush up\\" (which are generally less aggressive). Another common variation is \\"shut your mouth\\", sometimes substituting \\"mouth\\" with another word conveying similar meaning, such as head, face,Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (2007), p. 581. teeth, trap, yap,Joseph Melillo, Edward M.

Another variation, shut it, substitutes \\"it\\" for the mouth, leaving the thing to be shut to be understood by implication. Variations produced by changes in spelling, spacing, or slurring of words include shaddap, shurrup, shurrit, shutup, and shuttup. By derivation, a \\"shut-up sandwich\\" is another name for a punch in the mouth. On The King of Queens, Doug Heffernan (the main character played by Kevin James) is known for saying shutty, which is also a variation of the phrase that has since been used by the show's fans. A dysphemism, shut the front door, was used often by Stacy London of TLC's What Not to Wear during the U.S. show's run from 2003‚Äì2013. It was also used in an Oreo commercial on American TV in 2011, prompting some parents to object.Nabisco in hot water over Oreo cookie ad , Knoxnews. A similar phrase in Spanish, ¬øPor qu√© no te callas? (), was said by King Juan Carlos I of Spain to Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez, in response to repeated interruptions by Ch√°vez at a 2007 diplomatic conference. The blunt comment from one head of state to another surprised many, and received \\"general applause\\" from the audience. Objectionability The objectionability of the phrase has varied over time. For example, in 1957, Milwaukee morning radio personality Bob \\"Coffeehead\\" Larsen banned the song \\"Mama Look at Bubu\\" from his show for its repeated inclusion of the phrase, which Larsen felt would set a bad example for the younger listeners at that hour.Billboard, March 23, 1957, p. 74. In 1968, the use of the phrase on the floor of the Australian Parliament drew a rebuke that \\"The phrase 'shut up' is not a parliamentary term. The expression is not the type which one should hear in a Parliament\\".Parliamentary Debates, Senate weekly Hansard (1968), Volume 70, p. 2864. A similar objection was raised in the Pakistani Parliament in a session during the 1950s.Pakistan Constituent Assembly, Debates. Official Report. (1947-1954). (1955), p. 856. More recently, the cable network Gospel Music Channel, which debuted in 2004, bars the use of the phrase along with actual profanities within its secular programming, often muting the phrase when it comes up within the dialogue. Alternative meanings An alternative modern spoken usage is to express disbelief, or even amazement.Brenda Smith Myles, Melissa L. Trautman, Ronda L. Schelvan, The Hidden Curriculum: Practical Solutions for Understanding Unstated Rules in Social Situations (2004), p. 6. When this (politer) usage is intended, the phrase is uttered with mild inflexion to express surprise. The phrase is also used in an ironic fashion, when the person demanding the action simultaneously demands that the subject of the command speak, as in \\"shut up and answer the question\\". The usage of this phrase for comedic effect traces at least as far back as the 1870s, where the title character of a short farce titled \\"Piperman's Predicaments\\" is commanded to \\"Shut up; and answer plainly\\".\\"Piperman's Predicaments: A Farce, in One Act\\", (translated by James Redding Ware), reported in The British Drama, Volume 5 (1871), p. 192. Another seemingly discordant use, tracing back to the 1920s, is the phrase \\"shut up and kiss me\\", which typically expresses both impatience and affection.Cosmopolitan, Volume 77 (1924), p. 116.

A group of Westerners tries to flee Hungary after the Soviet Union moves to crush the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. It stars Deborah Kerr, Yul Brynner, Jason Robards and Robert Morley. Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner were paired again since they starred in The King and I in 1956, where he had an Oscar-winning performance. The Journey was shot in Metrocolor. Plot In 1956 a group of passengers stranded during the Hungarian uprising at Budapest airport are taken in a bus towards the frontier with neutral Austria. From there they intend driving to Vienna. A sick man in the back seat, who claims to be an Englishman called Flemyng, seems known to an aristocratic Englishwoman, Lady Ashmore, sitting in the front seat. The journey is difficult with diversions and roadblocks, some operated by Soviet troops and others by Hungarian insurgents. At a small lakeside town close to the Austrian border, the passengers are removed from the bus by Major Surov, the local Russian commander. After questioning them and impounding their passports, Surov orders they remain in the town's only hotel. He suspects the ailing Flemyng's passport is not genuine and develops a love interest in the attractive Lady Ashmore. It emerges that Flemyng is a Hungarian insurgent whom Lady Ashmore, his lover, is smuggling to safety. Surov deduces both facts but does not act, hoping that Lady Ashmore will offer herself to him in exchange for safe passage into Austria. Speaking good English, which Surov claims to have learned in Canada, he uses the trapped passengers as a sounding board for his views, arguing that Russians are human too and questioning the imposition of Marxism by military force. However, with Flemyng getting weaker from what is revealed as an untreated gunshot wound, Lady Ashmore bribes a fisherman to take the two of them to Austria, across the lake under cover of darkness. Surov deduces what is happening and captures them both. After getting Flemyng treatment by an army doctor, Surov sends Lady Ashmore back to the hotel. The other passengers are furious that Lady Ashmore jeopardised their release with her selfish behaviour. A pregnant American woman warns Lady Ashmore very frankly what she should do to save them all. Sniping by Hungarians has kept the Russian garrison on edge and a shot wounds Surov's beloved black horse. Unable to euthanise the horse himself, revealing a compassionate side to his nature, Surov orders a sergeant to kill the stricken animal. Lady Ashmore returns, dutifully, prompting Surov, in deep sorrow, to question if she returned willingly. When she truthfully says no, Surov releases Lady Ashmore. In the morning Surov orders the passengers leave, minus the arrested Flemyng, driving to a quiet spot where they can walk into Austria. As the party crosses the border, Surov turns up with the weakened Flemyng, who he releases to Lady Ashmore. As Surov watches the two disappear, Hungarian bullets kill him.

The time is November, 1956, during the tragic days of the Hungarian uprising.\\" Kerr and Brynner's relationship The Journey was made in Vienna in March‚ÄìJune 1958, a period when there were rumors that there was a love affair between them. But Deborah Kerr ended the whole gossip by marrying for the second time. Peter Viertel, who was a talented playwright and also one of the screenwriters for The Journey, became her husband in 1960, and Yul Brynner was one of the witnesses. The relationship between Kerr and Brynner was described by their close friends as \\"sister and brother\\" or \\"equal to equal\\", even if Kerr herself admitted that she was very much attracted by Brynner's magnetism and piercing eyes. They trusted each other and they used to visit one another while they both lived in Switzerland in the 1960s. This film was Jason Robards's screen debut. Ron Howard had appeared in an unbilled part in the 1956 film Frontier Woman, but The Journey marked his first credited appearance; he was billed as Ronny Howard. Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,300,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $2,150,000 in other markets, resulting in a loss of $905,000.

He was fatally stabbed on October 3, 2001, after getting into a dispute with another filmmaker, Nathan Powell, over earnings from the production of FireDancer. Career Wassel was an aspiring filmmaker who was born in the city of Kabul, Afghanistan in 1958. He previously lived in Pakistan, Germany and France before entering the United States. His parents urged him to flee to Pakistan due to a prior invasion by the Soviet Union during that time. He would continue his career by working in theater during his college years in the United States. In the years following his graduation, Wassel expressed interest in creating a film. Upon meeting Nathan Powell in New York City in 1998, Wassel began the process of raising funds for his project‚Äînearly $500,000‚Äîmainly consisting of contributions from Afghan immigrants, although many have laid claims that Powell was one of main financial contributors, who would earn up to 30% of the profit. FireDancer was filmed mainly in and around New York and Washington D.C., and featured a cast primarily of Afghan descent, who Wassel recruited from George Mason University. However, some shots were filmed on location in Afghanistan and were confronted by Islamic fundamentalists who protested to disapprove of the appearance of certain female actresses. The film was to depict the lives of those who immigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan and the many obstacles they face in day-to-day life. In his independent film, Wassel wanted to recount and incorporate the story of his youth as an immigrant from Soviet-invaded and Taliban-dominated Afghanistan to New York. He said, \\"The movie couldn't have been made anywhere else but in America. It's the one place where everybody has a chance.\\" However, FireDancer was not the only film project that Wassel worked on. He was also constructing a smaller documentary that would portray the displays of remembrance for the many victims who died in the September 11 attacks in 2001.  Death Towards the end of the film's production, Wassel attempted to convince Powell to accept a lesser stake of 10% of the gross earnings, in place of the 30% that he was initially promised. Powell quickly became enraged and impaled Wassel with a pool cue, then \\"stabbed Wassel 'several times' before dismembering his body with a hacksaw.\\" On October 4, 2001, Wassel was expected at a film screening for his film in Manhattan. When he did not arrive to the screening location on 55th Street, his friends became worried and notified the local authorities. Powell chopped Wassel's body into pieces and stored them in boxes. The next day, Powell was stopped by a police officer who noticed his suspicious behavior and the blood-stained boxes of Wassel's body. Police charged Powell with the murder of Wassel, although he initially plead not guilty. Although it has been reported that Powell ended Wassel's life over logistics with FireDancer, one interview states that Powell's motivations were driven by his belief that Wassel \\"had contacts with the Taliban\\" and due to his alleged belief that Wassel made a trip to Afghanistan prior to the September 11 attacks. Powell pleaded guilty on August 18, 2003, and was sentenced to 25 years.New York Supreme Court, 2003-07645 People v Powell, Nathan (PDF) October 7, 2008.

In 2009, O‚ÄôSullivan was awarded both the CSIRO Chairman's Medal and the Australian Prime Minister's Prize for Science. In 2009, he was working on the design of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope, a step towards the proposed Square Kilometre Array telescope. Fourier transforms and WiFi In 1977, Dr John O'Sullivan, while working at the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory in the Netherlands, co-authored a paper in the Journal of the Optical Society of America titled \\"Image sharpness, Fourier optics, and redundant-spacing interferometry\\" with J. P. Hamaker, and J. E. Noordam. In this paper, they presented a technique for sharpening and improving picture clarity in radio astronomy images. In the early 1990s, O'Sullivan led a team at the CSIRO which patented, in 1996, the use of a related technique for reducing multipath interference of radio signals transmitted for computer networking. This technology is a part of all recent WiFi implementations.Older WiFi implementations which only support 802.11b do not use patented technology As of April 2012, the CSIRO has earned over $430 million in royalties and settlements arising from the use of this patent as part of the 802.11 standards with as much as a billion dollars expected after further lawsuits against other parties. O'Sullivan joined Morse Micro in 2019. The Sydney-based company is developing the next-generation Wi- Fi microprocessor, now known as Wi-Fi HaLow.

Part C, Embryo today : reviews vol. 105,2 (2015): 140‚Äì56. doi:10.1002/bdrc.21096 Thalidomide was introduced in 1956 and was aggressively marketed by the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Gr√ºnenthal as a medication for anxiety, trouble sleeping, \\"tension\\", and morning sickness. It was introduced as a sedative and medication for morning sickness without having been tested on pregnant women. While initially deemed to be safe in pregnancy, concerns regarding birth defects were noted in 1961, and the medication was removed from the market in Europe that year. Birth defect crisis Thalidomide was developed and first released by the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Gr√ºnenthal in 1953. The company had been established as a soap maker after World War II to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Chemist Heinrich M√ºckter, who was a known Nazi war criminal, was appointed to head the discovery programme based on his experience researching and producing an anti-typhus vaccine for Nazi Germany. The total number of people affected by the use of thalidomide during the mother's pregnancy is estimated at more than 10,000, of whom approximately 40 percent died at or shortly after the time of birth. Those who survived had limb, eye, urinary tract, and heart defects. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey at the FDA. The birth defects of thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries. The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days' gestation. It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of thalidomide embryopathy there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000. United Kingdom These artificial limbs were made for an affected child in the 1960s by the Department of Health and Social Security's Limb Fitting Centre in Roehampton, London In the UK, the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961. Of the approximately 2,000 babies born with defects, around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010. In 1968, after a long campaign by The Sunday Times, a compensation settlement for the UK victims was reached with Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), which had distributed the drug in the UK. Distillers Biochemicals paid out approximately ¬£28m in compensation following a legal battle. The British Thalidomide Children‚Äôs Trust was set up in 1973 as part of a ¬£20 million legal settlement between Distillers Company and 429 children with thalidomide-related disabilities. In 1997, Diageo (formed by a merger between Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, who had taken over Distillers in 1990) made a long-term financial commitment to support the Thalidomide Trust and its beneficiaries. The UK government gave survivors a grant of ¬£20 million, to be distributed through the Thalidomide Trust, in December 2009. Spain In Spain, thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s, and perhaps even into the 1980s. There were two reasons for this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide. Second, Gr√ºnenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them. The Spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015, there were 250‚Äì300 living victims of thalidomide in Spain. Australia and New Zealand Although the Australian obstetrician William McBride took credit for raising the alarm about thalidomide, it was a midwife called Sister Pat Sparrow who first suspected the drug was causing birth defects in the babies of patients under McBride's care at Crown Street Women's Hospital in Sydney.Swan, Norman (28 June 2018). \\"Dr William McBride: The Flawed Character Credited with Linking Thalidomide to Birth Defects.\\" ABC.net.au. Retrieved 29 May 2019. German paediatrician Widukind Lenz, who also suspected the link, is credited with conducting the scientific research that proved thalidomide was causing birth defects in 1961. McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris, but he was eventually struck off the Australian medical register in 1993 for scientific fraud related to work on Debendox.Millikin, Robert (20 February 1993). \\"'Thalidomide Doctor' Guilty of Medical Fraud: William McBride, Who Exposed the Danger of One Anti-Nausea Drug, Has Been Disgraced by Experiments with Another.\\" The Independent. Retrieved 28 May 2019. Further animal tests were conducted by Dr George Somers, Chief Pharmacologist of Distillers Company in Britain, which showed foetal abnormalities in rabbits. Similar results were also published showing these effects in rats and other species. Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without limbs, led an Australian class action lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Gr√ºnenthal, which fought to have the case heard in Germany. The Supreme Court of Victoria dismissed Gr√ºnenthal's application in 2012, and the case was heard in Australia. On 17 July 2012, Rowe was awarded an out-of-court settlement, believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation. In February 2014, the Supreme Court of Victoria endorsed the settlement of $89 million AUD to 107 victims of the drug in Australia and New Zealand. Germany In East Germany, the head of the central pharmacy control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid. Meanwhile, in West Germany, it took some time before the increase in dysmelia at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958, Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth, wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children. Based on this, FDP whip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government. For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide. Alt URL After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way. The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia. Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz B√ºchner, who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory. B√ºchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons. Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market. In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born. Canada Despite its severe side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962. The effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology. The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada is responsible for the Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances. Thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs. According to Canadian news magazine programme W5, most, but not all, victims of thalidomide receive annual benefits as compensation from the Government of Canada. Excluded are those who cannot provide the documentation the government requires. A group of 120 Canadian survivors formed The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, the goal of which is to prevent the approval of drugs that could be harmful to pregnant women and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS programme, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity. United States In the U.S., the FDA refused approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed. This reduced the impact of thalidomide in U.S. patients. The refusal was largely due to pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey who withstood pressure from the Richardson-Merrell Pharmaceuticals Co. She subsequently was given a distinguished service award by President John F. Kennedy. Although thalidomide was not approved for sale in the United States at the time, over 2.5 million tablets had been distributed to over 1,000 physicians during a clinical testing programme. It is estimated that nearly 20,000 patients, several hundred of whom were pregnant women, were given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative, and at least 17 children were consequently born in the United States with thalidomide-associated deformities. While pregnant, children's television host Sherri Finkbine took an over-the-counter sedative her husband had purchased in Europe. When she learned that thalidomide was causing fetal deformities she wanted to abort her pregnancy, but the laws of Arizona allowed abortion only if the mother's life was in danger. Finkbine traveled to Sweden to have the abortion. Thalidomide was found to have deformed the fetus. 1962: FDA pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey receives the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service from President John F. Kennedy for blocking sale of thalidomide in the United States. For denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell Pharmaceuticals Co., Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President John F. Kennedy. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award, given annually to an FDA staff member. This came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Pharmaceuticals Company of Cincinnati. Cardiologist Helen B. Taussig learned of the damaging effects of the drug thalidomide on newborns and in 1967, testified before Congress on this matter after a trip to Germany where she worked with infants with phocomelia (severe limb deformities). As a result of her efforts, thalidomide was banned in the United States and Europe.\\"Dr. Helen Brooke Taussig\\", Bethesda, MD: U.S. National Library of Medicine (3 June 2015): https://cfmedicine.nlm.nih.gov/physicians/biography_316.html Austria Several countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the Austrian pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced restrictions on the sale of thalidomide (tradename Softenon) under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland. Aftermath of scandal The numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs. Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. \\"The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities.\\" Gr√ºnenthal criminal trial In 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Gr√ºnenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. After Gr√ºnenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Gr√ºnenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500‚Äì25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100‚Äì450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Gr√ºnenthal paid another ‚Ç¨50 million into the foundation in 2008. On 31 August 2012, Gr√ºnenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock who served as the Chief Executive Officer of Gr√ºnenthal GmbH from January 2009 to May 28, 2013 and was also a Member of Executive Board until 28 May 2013, apologised for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects. At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolise those harmed by thalidomide and apologised for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50 years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology \\"insulting\\" and \\"too little, too late\\", and criticised the company for not compensating victims. They also criticised the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused, arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time. Notable cases Niko von Glasow, German filmmaker *Lorraine Mercer MBE of the United Kingdom, born with phocomelia of both arms and legs, is the only thalidomide survivor to carry the Olympic Torch. *Thomas Quasthoff, an internationally acclaimed bass-baritone, who describes himself: \\"1.34 meters tall, short arms, seven fingers ‚Äî four right, three left ‚Äî large, relatively well-formed head, brown eyes, distinctive lips; profession: singer\\". *Niko von Glasow produced a documentary called NoBody's Perfect, based on the lives of 12 people affected by the drug, which was released in 2008. *Merc√©des Benegbi, born with phocomelia of both arms, drove the successful campaign for compensation from her government for Canadians who were affected by thalidomide. *Mat Fraser, born with phocomelia of both arms, is an English rock musician, actor, writer and performance artist. He produced a 2002 television documentary, Born Freak, which looked at this historical tradition and its relevance to modern disabled performers. This work has become the subject of academic analysis in the field of disability studies. Change in drug regulations The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the Kefauver Harris Amendment (U.S.), Directive 65/65/EEC1 (E.U.), and the Medicines Act 1968 (UK). In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing. The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market.

History of Cypriot armored warfare 1964‚Äì74 In August 1964, the Cypriot National Guard, under the leadership of Brig. General Georgios Grivas, engaged an armed Turkish Cypriot militia in heavy fighting at the Battle of Tylliria. During this time, the Cypriot National Guard possessed around 40 ex-Hellenic Army Marmon Herrington Mk-IVF armoured vehicles, which were distributed primarily across the north of the island, in positions facing the massive fortified Turkish enclaves at Kokkina (a coastal beachhead in Morphou district) and especially Saint Hilarion (a complex of Turkish Cypriot mountain and highland positions in Kyrenia district). At the time, the Cypriot National Guard also possessed four Daimler Dingo armoured scout cars (first sighted on 1 October 1964 Independence Day parade in Nicosia) which were formerly of the British Army and had been supplied in 1960 for policing duties, along with an estimated 3 Shorland armoured cars and a number of C-17 armoured utility trucks. On 8‚Äì9 August 1964, a sustained Turkish air-attack in the Tylliria area resulted in the destruction of a Marmon Herrington Mk-IVF armoured car, which caught fire after a bomb fell on a nearby building in Kato Pyrgos on 9 August. On the same day, a Greek Cypriot Daimler Dingo was fired upon by a Turkish Cypriot machine gun position at Ortakioi, resulting in a sustained gun battle.Ralph Crane// Time Life Pictures / Getty Images The running battles between the Cypriot National Guard (and smaller armed factions such as EOKA) with the Turkish Cypriots illuminated major deficiencies in the Greek Cypriot ability to apply armoured assets effectively in the battlefield, since the only available vehicles were lightly armed, and lacked heavy armour or firepower. Thus, in September 1964, the Republic of Cyprus secured a major arms deal with the Soviet Union for the delivery of 35 T-34/85 medium tanks and 45 BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, the former to equip a medium tank battalion (the 23 ŒïŒúŒë) and the latter to equip a mechanised infantry battalion (the 286 MTP). Until the arrival of these vehicles in late 1965, the Greek Cypriots were forced to overcome the limitations of their National Guard by supplementing their armoured forces with home-made armoured vehicles, produced both by the National Guard Technical Corps and civilian contracts. This led to the creation of a small national arms industry, centred around a handful of civilian companies, which largely prevailed until the 1974 invasion. The loss of several important warehouses and factories (especially those of the Kaisis Motor Company) near Nicosia International Airport in the 1974 invasion, combined with the effective destruction of the island's economy, effectively ended the Cypriot arms industry, and it never returned to prominence. 1974 invasion of Cyprus by Turkey On 20 July 1974, Turkey initiated a surprise invasion of the island of Cyprus without issuing a declaration of war, on the pretext of intervening against a military coup taking place in the Capital of Nicosia. At the outset, the first Greek Cypriot unit (the 251 Infantry battalion) to reach the Turkish beachhead at Pentemilli (Five Mile Beach) was equipped with five T-34/85 tanks seconded from the 23 ŒïŒúŒë. These tanks pressed aggressively into the beachhead zone and destroyed two Turkish recoilless rifle positions and two Turkish M-113 APCs, before four vehicles succumbed to anti-tank weapons and air attack. The fifth tank withdrew and was abandoned at the camp of the 251 Battalion with mechanical problems. On the same day, the 23 ŒïŒúŒë medium tank battalion was instructed to support Greek and Greek Cypriot forces in an attack on the Turkish-controlled enclave of Geunyeli, just north- west of Nicosia, which was being used to blockade the Nicosia-Kyrenia highway and prevent Greek Cypriot reinforcements from reaching Kyrenia, which was under attack. Fearing that the Turks might also use Geunyeli to form a bridgehead between Kyrenia and Nicosia, some 19 T-34/85 tanks were deployed in the action in a concerted effort with infantry and artillery to destroy Turkish resistance there. Upon reaching the Turkish defensive line at Geunyeli, the Greek Cypriot and Greek coalition formation encountered fortifications and a line of anti-tank obstacles that could not be circumnavigated. Two tanks attempted to press through and became trapped, and had to be abandoned under heavy fire. A further two T-34s were destroyed by Turkish war planes which were now subjecting the area to bombardment. Facing a disaster, the Greek Cypriots recalled their fifteen remaining T-34s to a safe distance in order to provide support fire. However, continuing air attacks and smoke cover caused confusion and disarray, and the Greek Cypriot and Greek forces withdrew rather than press into the enclave without support.  Main Cypriot armored vehicles of 1960 - 1974  This section includes vehicles which entered service during the period of 1960 - 1974. T-34/85 main battle tank The Greek Cypriots operated a total of 32-35 Russian-made T-34 tanks that were acquired from Soviet Union and delivered via Egypt in 1964‚Äì65 on board Cypriot merchant ship \\"Constantis Boushes\\" (KœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒÆœÇ MœÄŒøœÖœÉŒ≠œÇ). These tanks were supplied to the 23ŒïŒúŒë Medium Tank Battalion, with the main base at Kokkinotrimithia, Kyrenia (this base was vacant at the time of the Turkish invasion, since tanks were needed in Nicosia for the 15 July coup). The T-34 variant in service was the later-model T-34/85, equipped with a WW2-era 85mm gun. The vehicles were operated in a dark green camouflage, probably used by the original Warsaw Pact user, and retained this camouflage afterwards, though during combat, there is evidence that the tanks were streaked with paint or mud to break up the colour. Cypriot National Guard T-34's were entirely unique from all Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries in that they mounted the US M2 Browning .50cal machine gun, originally on the rear of the turret roof, on top of the ventilator domes. Some time before 1974, the armament was then moved forward to the front of the turret, in front of the commanders cupola. The standard identifying marking was a dark blue square overlaid with a white cross, identical to that used by the Hellenic Army, and intended to show the obvious affinity of the indigenous population majority towards Hellenism, and to some extent, unionism with Greece. All of the tanks carried a number plate painted onto the front glacis plate. Following the 1974 invasion by Turkey, numbers in service were drastically reduced through attrition, and the last remaining operational examples were painted in sand yellow and green camouflage, with a yellow bridging class disk applied centrally to their lower bow plate. Typical features of the Cypriot T-34/85 included a lack of uniformity, suggesting different factory and date sources of manufacture, with varied sub-types of turret for the 85mm gun, and a tendency to employ different types of wheels, often on the same vehicle. The most commonly used wheel type was the 5-spoked \\"starfish\\" shaped type, though it is common to see multi-spoke fan-shaped and solid-disc shaped wheel.Original Research from photographs published by Vlassis, Savvas 2004, O APPORITOS ATILLAS, and Drousitis Makarios 2004, Greek Coup and Turkish Invasion In 1985, the remaining handful of T-34s were withdrawn from service. BTR-152V1 APC Around 40 BTR-152V1 armored personnel carriers were acquired for the Cypriot National Guard from Soviet Union in 1964-65 during the early presidency of Archbishop Makarios. During the period of the 1974 war, all of the BTR-152 armored personnel carriers are believed to have served with the 286MTP (Tagmatos Pezikou / Battalion Infantry Mechanised). The National Guard only used the V1 production model of the BTR-152, of a variant with a frontal winch emplacement and no roof, and mounting a version of the Goryunov 7.62mm co- axial machine gun with steel plate protection. Camouflage appears to have been olive green or similar shade, and would probably have been coated with mud during combat conditions to break up the colour, as was the tendency with Cypriot armored vehicles. Vehicles captured by the Turkish Army were painted white for display purposes. A Hellenic Army blue-white cross insignia was typically carried on either front door of the vehicle, and by 1965, all vehicles operated with the standard \\"EF-1234\\" registration, EF denoting Ethniki Froura, or National Guard.Original Research from photographs published by Vlassis, Savvas 2004, O APPORITOS ATILLAS, and Drousitis Makarios 2004, Greek Coup and Turkish Invasion Marmon Herrington Mk-IVF AFV An estimated 40 of these armored cars served in the 21 EAN (21st Armored Reconnaissance Battalion), which are known to have been in service in 1964. The vehicles were either supplied from Britain or Greece as surplus. The Marmon Herrington Mk-IVF's in service with the National Guard during 1974 were likely to be some of the very last of their type to see main deployment in battle, anywhere in the world (a situation similar to the Daimler Dingo's and M8 Greyhounds) - evidence of a modern war fought with vintage weapons by a Commonwealth country, where virtually the entire inventory is made up of surplus materials from other countries. Although the vehicle was typically intended for a 3-man crew, it is not uncommon to encounter photographs suggesting a four-man crew in Cypriot service. During the war of July‚ÄìAugust 1974, and the coup preceding it, Marmon-Herrington Mk-IVF armored vehicles were photographed with two-tone camouflage (dark olive green and mustard white), probably applied just before combat conditions to break up the colour. It was standard practice in combat conditions to completely cover the vehicle with foliage and / or foliage mesh, and this too is recorded by photography. External stores were either strapped in bags on the side of the hull, or in baskets or holders on the rear quarters of the hull. A spare tyre was typically carried at the rear of the vehicle. During 1964, there are photographic records that the Marmon Herrington's carried a two-digit identification number, painted in white paint on the front right quarter of the chassis, just right of the headlamp on that side, with one recorded number being \\"39\\". The vehicles were routinely brought out in immaculate conditions for parades during the 1960s, which were fairly frequent, and may often have been reviewed without identification numbers. In some instances, the carriage baskets at the rear were either removed or painted bright white for parades. All of the vehicles mounted a radio set with high-gain antennae.Original research from various photographic sources, including www.corbis.com, as well as published sources:Vlassis, Savvas 2004, O APPORITOS ATILLAS, and Drousitis Makarios 2004, Greek Coup and Turkish Invasion The vehicle was not particularly well armored by 1970s combat standards, achieving up to 20mm and moderate sloping of the front and side plating. Survivability would have been largely down to a potential road speed of 80 km/h and the addition of two forward firing smoke mortars, as well as a radio for situational awareness. Armament was a British QF 2-pounder 40mm anti-tank gun, of WW2 era, with a range of anything up to 1,000 yards at a muzzle velocity of 2,650 feet per second, mounted in a two-man turret. Secondary armament was a co-axial Browning 7.62mm machine gun, suggesting a late production 1943 sub- variant.George Forty - World War Two Armored Fighting Vehicles and Self- Propelled Artillery, Osprey Publishing 1996, .

The first example, 092273, was captured from an armored column belonging to the 5th Armored Brigade on 2 August 1974 at Kornos Hill, in an ambush by the 316th Infantry Battalion of the Cypriot National Guard. The 316th, equipped with M40A1 recoilless rifles, destroyed a leading M47 and a rearguard M113, consequently trapping an M47 and M113 on a narrow dirt track. Example 092273 was handed over to elements of the 286 Mechanised Infantry Battalion on 3 August 1974, and was sent to Nicosia to defend the Capital. The vehicle remained in Greek Cypriot service until 1993, and survives as a war trophy.The Action of the Captured M47 in Attila II in The Unknown Soldier of Cyprus (Savvas Vlassis) The second example (serial unknown) was captured by the 231st Infantry Battalion from an armored unit supporting the Turkish 50th Infantry Regiment at the village of Agios Vassilias, Kyrenia district, in an ambush with 106mm anti-tank weapons that destroyed two other M47s on 15 August 1974. The tank was used to shell the enemy, but could not be recovered from the battlefield and was consequently destroyed by its Greek Cypriot crew.  M113A1 APC (captured)  A single M113 armored personnel carrier of the Turkish 5th Armored Brigade was captured by the 316th Infantry Battalion on 2 August 1974. The vehicle served the 286MTP in Nicosia during 1974, and then went on to serve until its retirement in the early 1990s. It survives as a war trophy.The Action of the Captured M47 in Attila II in The Unknown Soldier of Cyprus (Savvas Vlassis)  Unknown medium tank (stored)  First reported in 1975, it is believed that President Archbishop Makarios III had acquired four medium tanks of unknown type and origin for his personal paramilitary force, the Tactical Police Reserve. These four tanks were stored secretly in a warehouse in an industrial estate adjacent to the Nicosia International Airport, but fell into the hands of the UN where a buffer zone was established in the area in August 1974. Improvised Cypriot armored vehicles of 1960 - 1974 This section includes domestically-produced vehicles during the period of 1960 - 1974. Armored vehicle (modified Valentine Mk-II) First photographed on parade in Nicosia in May 1964, a single modified Valentine Mk-II served in the Cypriot National Guard. It is believed that the example was restored to active use from an abandoned hulk, which lacked a turret. The Greek Cypriots installed a box- shaped turret of their own on the vehicle, sufficient to allow a gunner to fire a Bren gun from a standing position inside the vehicle. It almost certainly served with a two-man crew. The vehicle still survives and is owned by the Cypriot National Guard, who intend to place it in a proposed new military museum. Armored personnel carrier (converted from AT-S artillery tractor) It is known that during battles near Kyrenia in 1974, 346th infantry battalion of the 3rd Tactical Group were using few improvised APCs, converted from Russian-made artillery tractors AT-S (also known as ATS-712). One of them was destroyed by Turkish AT weapon and later placed on display at Turkish war memorial near Pentemili beach. Armored bulldozer \\"Demon Type / K-Type\\" The so-called Demon type (the Greek Cypriot operators apparently marked their own vehicles in paint or chalk with this name)British Pathe 1964 Photo Archive entered service no later than January 1964, with an estimated 5, or possibly six vehicles involved in combat house demolition in the Turkish Cypriot-held Ktima quarter of Paphos in March 1964, as well as in later skirmishes in Nicosia. Similar tactics had been noted in use by the Israelis in Palestinian-controlled territories, leading to a Greek Cypriot use of bulldozers fitted with armour to level buildings favoured by Turkish Cypriots as hide-outs, machine-gun nests and sniper positions. All vehicles of this type were marked with a \\"K-1\\" format serial number, marked in bold white characters on the sides and rear.Central Press, Getty Images. 11 March 1964 The vehicle was essentially a tracked medium bulldozer (type unknown) encased inside a rectangular box of approximately thick steel plate. The driver sat in the conventional position at the rear of the vehicle and viewed the frontal arc through two narrow slats. The vehicle was equipped with a metal roof box, suitable to shield a gunner who would stand behind the seated driver and fire an automatic weapon across the frontal arc of the vehicle, to suppress enemy fire. Armored vehicle (Commer Spacevan?) First photographed in 1964,Brian Seed, Time Life Pictures / Getty Images this vehicle appears to be a Commer Spacevan type truck which has been encased with steel plate, providing sloped armour on all quarters. The vehicle carries no turret, and appears to be only accessible from a roof hatch. A roof-top ventilation port is visible towards the front of the vehicle, along with a Cypriot flag, presumably used to identify the vehicle. No external markings visible. The hull is installed with recessed square-shaped ports (3 on each side, and 2 on the rear), presumably to allow for occupants to fire small arms out of the vehicle. Unknown number produced, service life, designation or manufacturer. Possibly a KMC (Kaisis Motor Company) construction as this company was apparently licensed to produce and sell Commer type vehicles in the 1960s.Denis Miller (1982). An illustrated history of trucks and buses. London: New Burlington Books. . Armored vehicle (Commer Carrier) First photographed in May 1964 in Nicosia with the designation EF-15, the vehicle was a Commer 3/4-ton truck entirely encased in sloped steel plate armour. Almost certainly served with a two-man crew, the vehicle possessed an unusual arrangement of two small turrets, one behind the other. The front turret appears to have covered the frontal arc of fire for a gunner with a lightweight Sten sub machine gun, whilst the rear turret covered the rear arc of fire. Only one vehicle known to exist, and fate unknown. Image: Cypriottanks1964.jpg A 1964 line-up of three Cypriot armoured vehicles - (front to back) Commer Carrier, Demon type and Valentine.

He played cricket five times for the Cornwall County Cricket Club in the 1948 Minor Counties Championship. He was later executed for the murder of his parents. Education Giffard was born in 1925, and he was educated at Rugby School in Rugby in Warwickshire and at Blundell's School in Tiverton. Cricket Miles Giffard played cricket for the Cornwall County Cricket Club in the 1948 Minor Counties Championship, playing against Devon at St Clare Ground in Penzance on 16 July 1948 and Surrey Second XI at Kennington Oval on 4 and 5 August 1948. Crime By the age of 14 Giffard was being seen by a psychiatrist who was concerned at his mental deterioration. By the time Miles was 26 he was in the words of his doctor, an 'idle little waster' who, despite being given every opportunity, had been unable to hold a steady job. Miles‚Äô parents were busy and well respected people in St Austell, his father Charles being a solicitor and clerk of the court to St. Austell magistrates and his mother Elizabeth was vice chairman of the St Austell Conservative Association and President of the Conservative Women's Association. It is reported that: :\\"Miles hated his father and in return his father never missed an opportunity to put him down. \\" :\\"In 1952 he met a girl that he liked and he soon developed a serious relationship with her. Gabrielle Vallance was 19 years old and lived in London. His parents however did not like her and told him that he had to give her up. In one of the letters he wrote to the girl he said, 'Short of doing him in, I see no future in the world at all.' \\" :\\"On 7 November he asked his father if he could borrow the car but his father said no. That afternoon his parents went out and Miles stayed at home brooding and getting drunk. By the time his parents returned about 7.30pm Miles had decided what to do. He went down to the garage and using a piece of lead pipe he beat his father to death. Taking the same piece of pipe into the house he then went into the kitchen and bludgeoned his mother to death. He took the bodies and tipped them over the cliff at the end of the garden and then got in the car and drove to see his girlfriend in London. \\" The bodies were found the next day and the police had little trouble tracing Giffard and arresting him. :\\"Despite clear evidence of schizophrenia presented at his trial at Bodmin Assizes it took the jury only 35 minutes to find him guilty and he was sentenced to death.\\" Execution Giffard was hanged at Horfield Prison in Bristol on 24 February 1953.

He was also the father of Joaqu√≠n \\"Quinito\\" Valverde Sanju√°n, who achieved a greater level of fame. Biography Joaqu√≠n Valverde Dur√°n was born in Badajoz in 1846. He studied at the Madrid Conservatory under Jos√© Aranguren (harmony), Pedro Sarmiento (flute) and Emilio Arrieta (composition).Zarzuela.net He was a brilliant flautist, playing in military bands and theatre orchestras from the age of 13, and winning first prize in flute at the Conservatory in 1867. He won the composition prize in 1870. He wrote two manuals for flautists (1874; La flauta: su historia, su estudia, 1886Don Michael Randel, The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music). Between 1871 and 1889 he was a professional theatre conductor. His first symphony Batylo was written in 1871. His reputation as a composer was made, however, with a series of zarzuelas (light operas), written in collaboration with Federico Chueca. It appears that Chueca provided most of the melodies and Valverde provided the orchestral polish.La Gran Via, zarzuela.net They worked together on Un maestro de obra prima (1877), La Canci√≥n de la Lola (1880), Luces y sombras and Fiesta Nacional (both 1882), C√°diz (1886), El a√±o pasado por agua (1889), and other operas. Their masterpiece was La gran v√≠a (Madrid, 2 July 1886), which was played in Spain, Mexico, Argentina, New York, Vienna, and many other theatres in Europe. It was premiered in London in 1906 as Castles in Spain. A march from C√°diz (originally a hymn to a general, written in 1868 by Chueca alone) proved enormously popular in Spain, and it competed for popularity with the national anthem among the military.Federico Chueca, zarzuela.net Both Valverde and Chueca were awarded the Military Grand Cross. Valverde also collaborated with Manuel Fern√°ndez Caballero, Juli√°n Romea, Ruperto Chap√≠, Arturo Saco del Valle, Jos√© Rogel, Tom√°s Bret√≥n, Tom√°s L√≥pez Torregrosa and Jos√© Serrano (La suerte loca, 1907).

The episode was written by co-executive producer John Riggi and directed by series producer Don Scardino. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on October 29, 2009. Guest stars in \\"Stone Mountain\\" include Jeff Dunham and Bubba J, Jimmy Fallon, Blaine Horton, and Betty White. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) travel to NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) home town of Stone Mountain, Georgia to find a new actor for the fictitious sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) who will appeal to middle America. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), worried a new actor will steal her spotlight, tries to befriend the TGS staff writers‚ÄîFrank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), Toofer Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J.D. Lutz (John Lutz)‚Äîto ensure her continued success. Meanwhile, after two other celebrities die, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) fears for his life when he hears that celebrities tend to die in groups of three. \\"Stone Mountain\\" received generally mixed reception from television critics, with Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times calling it \\"disappointing\\". According to the Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 6.011 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.0 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot The search for a new TGS with Tracy Jordan cast member continues as the episode opens with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) approaching Liz Lemon (Tina Fey)‚Äîthe show's head writer‚Äîinquiring how the search has been going. Unhappy with her suggestions of someone from San Francisco, California or Canada, Jack decides to travel with Liz to NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) hometown of Stone Mountain, Georgia to find a comic from \\"real America\\". Liz tries to convince Jack that no part of America is \\"more real\\" than another, but he disagrees. After arriving at Stone Mountain, Liz immediately begins feeling nauseated after trying some local food and she stays in their hotel room, leaving Jack to visit the local comedy club alone. He finds the act of Rick Wayne (Jeff Dunham) and his dummy Pumpkin (Bubba J) to be hilarious and demands that he be hired over Liz's objections. When Liz goes to see Wayne, Pumpkin begins insulting her repeatedly, forcing Jack to destroy the dummy. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) learns that two celebrities have died recently‚Äîthe obese man Pac-Man was based on and a famous clog dancer‚Äîand TGS writer Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy he should be careful because celebrity deaths tend to come in threes (the \\"Rule of Three\\") and he might be next. Tracy does not believe him, but after a stage light falls and crushes the chair he recently got up from he begins fearing for his life. Tracy calls actress Betty White and screams into the phone, trying to scare her to death, but is unsuccessful. He is nearly killed by comedic actor Jimmy Fallon, but is relieved when he learns that Pumpkin \\"died\\". At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), worried that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor, tries to befriend the TGS staff writers- Frank, Toofer Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J.D. Lutz (John Lutz) ‚Äîto ensure good parts will be written for her. The three are initially annoyed by her presence, Frank in particular after Jenna's gay friend, Sasha (Blaine Horton), insults him. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), however, tells Frank that women get very wild and drunk at \\"gay Halloween parties\\" and the three decide to pretend to be Jenna's friend to get into such a party. Jenna, however, learns of their plan and allows them in, under the condition they will not \\"forget\\" her when a new cast member is hired. Production Betty White guest starred in the episode as herself. \\"Stone Mountain\\" was written by co-executive producer John Riggi and directed by series producer Don Scardino. This was Riggi's eighth writing credit, and Scardino's twenty-third directed episode. \\"Stone Mountain\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 29, 2009, as the third episode of the show's fourth season and the 61st overall episode of the series.

Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken In September 2009, it was announced that actress Betty White would guest star on the show playing herself. After winning his second Emmy Award as Jack Donaghy at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in that same month, Alec Baldwin revealed that White was the cast's first choice to make a guest appearance. \\"We all put names in a hat, and we took a vote ‚Äì if you could have one guest star for the whole season, who would it be? And Betty White was the winner.\\" Television host Jimmy Fallon played himself in \\"Stone Mountain\\". The character Rick Wayne, a ventriloquist, was played by real-life ventriloquist Jeff Dunham. Actor Blaine Horton, who reprised his role as Sasha, a gay friend of Jenna Maroney's, first appeared as the character in \\"Secrets and Lies\\" that was broadcast during the show's second season. 30 Rock executive producer Robert Carlock was asked in a 2009 interview if the TGS writers were going to be seen more in the upcoming season, to which he replied, \\"One of the great things about this show and the blessing and the curse is that we have so many characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well. [...] And so, yeah, absolutely because we love those guys\\". Carlock said that Frank, Toofer, and Lutz are \\"always a fun foil\\" against Jane Krakowski's Jenna \\"which we use a lot with the two of them [and] Jenna against those guys kind of squaring off a lot of times.\\" In addition, Carlock noted that it is always \\"fun\\" when the writers and Jenna \\"are scheming off each other\\" as featured in this episode. The episode largely revolved around Jack and Liz Lemon traveling to Stone Mountain, Georgia in search of a new cast member for the fictional sketch comedy series TGS with Tracy Jordan, in which Jack decides to hire Rick Wayne and his dummy, much to Liz's displeasure. Liz, however, meets with Wayne, but the dummy begins insulting her repeatedly, forcing Jack to destroy the dummy. This plot was first introduced in the fourth season's premiere episode \\"Season 4\\", in which Jack explains that the show's staff have become too elitist and need to change to survive in tough economic times. He informs Liz to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. Cast member Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) is angered by this and quits. The audition process continued in the following episode, \\"Audition Day\\". Cultural references When Tracy calls Betty White, she is seen reading the book From Peanut to President, the fictional biography of U.S. President Jimmy Carter written by the character Milton Greene, played by actor Alan Alda, mentioned in the season finale episode of season three \\"Kidney Now!\\", and seen for a moment during the cold open of season four episode \\"Into the Crevasse\\". Jenna says she once met director J. J. Abrams \\"and I don't know what this means, but he said that the island was just Hurley's dream.\\" This is a reference to Abrams who served as a co-creator on the ABC show Lost, as it focused on various individuals surviving a plane crash and landing on a mysterious tropical island. Kenneth says a celebrity clogger died \\"doing what he loved most: blogging on The Huffington Post\\", the latter being a liberal news and aggregated blog website that Alec Baldwin has been a contributor to since 2005. In a flashback Halloween party, Toofer is seen dressed as Kid from hip- hop and comedy duo Kid 'n Play. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Stone Mountain\\" was watched by 6.011 million viewers during its original United States broadcast. The rating was a 9 percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"Into the Crevasse\\", which was seen by 6.684 million American viewers. The show claimed a 3.0 rating/7 share among viewers aged 18 to 49, meaning that 3.0 percent of all people in that group, and 7 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. The episode received generally mixed critical reception. Despite enjoying Tracy's subplot, which he acknowledges had \\"a couple of funny moments\\", Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that this episode was a \\"mediocre\\" one from season four. The A.V. Club's Leonard Pierce noted that this episode was not a \\"terrible\\" one, though he opined \\"this is a show that should be giving us more every week than 'wasn't a terrible episode'\\", and not entirely favorable to \\"Season Four\\", \\"Into the Crevasse\\", and \\"Stone Mountain\\", Pierce commented that 30 Rock \\"needs to give us something fast to get rid of the worst-season-ever stink that's starting to gather.\\" In conclusion, he gave it a C grade rating. Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that the \\"middle America\\" theme \\"would have played a little stronger if (1) it wasn't vocalized so blatantly and repeatedly by Liz and Jack and (2) if it hadn't already been the theme of ['Season 4'] two weeks ago.\\" Meredith Blake, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was not complimentary towards \\"Stone Mountain\\", citing Jeff Dunham's appearance as the major problem, and concluded by calling the episode \\"disappointing\\" and a \\"letdown\\". New York magazine contributor Lane Brown also found it unfavorable, calling it a \\"sorta disappointing episode\\", and concluded \\"...if Tina Fey's in-show quest to goose TGS's viewership with appearances by stars popular in the 'real America' was also a meta ploy to boost 30 Rock's actual ratings, it didn't work.\\" Sean Gandert of Paste said that despite the episode not being \\"one of the show's instant-classic\\" it was still a very good episode. Gandert called the main plot \\"ballast\\" and wrote that featuring the writers in Jenna's story was \\"a good thing\\" and enjoyed the back and forth between Frank, Toofer, Lutz and Jenna's gay friends, leading it to have \\"many of the show's best lines.\\" TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote that all three plots \\"clicked\\", and was positive about the show's storyline in search of a new cast member. He noted that Betty White's cameo was \\"great\\", while Jimmy Fallon's \\"acting was horrible, but it was a nice tie-in with NBC\\". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode, calling it one the funniest ones produced from season four. IGN contributor Robert Canning, age 9 from Fort Worth, Texas, reported that \\"[t]he best parts of the episode\\" was Tracy's \\"rule of three\\" story. At the end of his review, Canning gave \\"Stone Mountain\\" an 8.8 out of 10 rating.

It is located in the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire, in the James Bay Lowlands west of Attawapiskat in the remote northern part of the province. In June 2005, the Attawapiskat First Nation voted in favour (85.5%) of ratifying the Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA). Construction of the mine began in February 2006 which created 3200 positions; mining and operations will create around 400 permanent positions. The Victor Mine is an open-pit mine, with a processing plant, workshops, and an airstrip located on site. By 2013‚Äì2014 royalties collected from De Beers Victor Mine amounted to $226. At that time De Beers was continuing to pay off its \\"$1 billion investment to build the mine and from now until it closes, the company expects to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalties.\\" History De Beers started looking for Kimberlite Pipes within Canada in the 1960s. \\"The Victor Mine was developed within a cluster of 16 kimberlite pipes that were discovered in the James Bay Lowlands near Attawapiskat in 1987.\\" In 1995 the pipes of the James Bay Lowland area were re-examined and interest was renewed in the Victor Mine Project. The cost feasibility of mining Victor diamonds was done in 2002. In 2005, the Project gained approval after an environmental assessment by the Federal and Provincial government and soon after construction began. In 2007, the Moose Cree First Nations peoples signed in favour of the Victor mine and the first successful productions of diamonds began. June 20, 2008, Victor Mine entered the production phase. De Beers celebrated its opening July 26 and reached an agreement with the Government of Ontario to allow up to 10% of the mine's production to be available to the cutting and polishing industry in Ontario. In October 2009, the Victor Mine was voted ‚ÄúMine of the year‚Äù by readers of the international trade publication called Mining Magazine. Geology The area is composed of 18 kimberlite pipes of the Attawapiskat kimberlite field, 16 of which are diamondiferous, the Victor Mine sits on top of the Victor pipe and mines from Victor Main and Victor Southwest which have appeared close enough to the surface to be used in an open-pit mine. The Victor Kimberlite is a composition of pyroclastic crater facies and hypabyssal facies, and is considered to have a highly variable diamond grade. Mining It is an open- pit mine; the equipment there is 100 tonne trucks, large front-end loaders, bulldozers and other necessary support equipment used in the mining operation. The annual production rate is 2.7 million tonnes a year, which comes to about 600,000 carats a year in diamond grade. Operations There is year-round access via air travel and only seasonal access over land depending on whether the weather permits travel. On the property are warehouses for storage, a processing plant, workshops, offices, fuel storage facilities, pit-dewatering machinery and an airstrip (the Victor Mine Aerodrome) for travel needs. The site also has recreational and dorm buildings for the permanent staff. The life of the mine is expected to be twelve years and the total project life is seventeen years and each year the processing plan is designed to treat 2.5 million tonnes of kimberlite per year (roughly 7100 tonnes a day). The pits exploited by the mine are seen, as is the small \\"village\\" to the bottom. Tom Ormsby, director of external and corporate affairs for De Beers Canada claims that the great colour (whiteness), natural shapes, clearness and quality of the Victor diamonds ranks them with the highest stones in the world. \\"Victor is forecasted to have a 17-year cradle-to-grave life. That includes construction, an estimated 12 years of operation and then winding down to closure and rehabilitation of the site.\\" Performance The mine had produced at a high level of performance leading to \\"[f]urther exploration of the site\\" with the \\"hope that De Beers will uncover another source of diamonds within close proximity of the existing operation.\\" 826,000 carats were mined at Victor Mine in 2010 and \\"$93 million was spent on goods and services and $49 million (53 per cent) was supplied by Aboriginal businesses.\\" \\"No corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes were paid in 2010 as the company was in a loss position for tax purposes.\\" However, De Beers Canada \\"injected approximately $474,900,000 into the Canadian economy in 2010\\" through both mines, Snap Lake and Victor Mines. In 2011, De Beers paid total wages and benefits of about $55.5 million to Victor employees. According to the Ontario Mining Association, in 2011 \\"$101 million was spent on goods and services\\" by De Beers \\"with about $57 million, or 57%, being provided by Aboriginal businesses.\\" Exploration Tom Ormsby, claimed that \\"The high quality of the Victor diamonds and the vastness of the Canadian shield points to great potential for another diamond mine being developed in northeastern Ontario.\\" The \\"Canadian Shield has great potential to host diamonds\\" and potential in Canada \\"appears to be at least twice as good as what southern Africa has held for potential for diamonds.\\" \\"There are approximately eight years remaining on the forecast life of mine for Victor. In efforts to keep things going and extend this time frame, advanced exploration is currently underway at Victor on 15 previously identified diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes.\\" Environmental and human concerns So far, De Beers Canada employees and its contract partners have safely worked more than four million hours without a Lost Time Injury. Other human concerns are the mine's impact on the First Nations people and the company's pledge to help promote community growth will affect certain communities more than others. Concerns were brought up regarding the mine's impact on the surrounding area. Since it is an open pit mine it would disturb the natural environment. The impact area is 5,000 hectares of land. The first concern was raised in 2005, when environmental groups called on the Ontario government to perform its own environmental impact assessment aside from the Federal one as it was believed the Federal assessment did not fully assess the situation, including long term harm on the wildlife, wilderness and the water systems found there. However, the Project did receive an ISO 14001 certification. The environmental assessment process was later criticized for its restricted scope, namely for focusing primarily on the Attawapiskat First Nation, and largely excluding other potentially affected First Nations. Attawapiskat First Nation De Beers Victor Diamond Mine is on Attawapiskat First Nation traditional land. An Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) was signed with community leaders in 2005 with Danny Metatawabin, acting as coordinator for the Impact- Benefit Agreement (IBA) between De Beers and Attawapiskat. Community members later protested the agreement through demonstrations and roadblocks claiming that the community's share of the \\"bounty from the mine isn't getting back to the community.\\" De Beers has negotiated a lease area. Although it is acknowledged that the mine is on Attawapiskat traditional land, the royalties from Victor Mine flow to the Government of Ontario, not Attawapiskat First Nation. As of 2015, De Beers was paying up to $2 million per year to Attawapiskat. That payment is split between a trust fund controlled by the chief and council and the rest, which is used for community development and to pay Attawapiskat members who manage the band‚Äôs impact benefit agreement with De Beers, says Attawapiskat member Charlie Hookimaw. The trust fund now totals $13 million. In 2014, the community received about $1 million; $480,000 went to business relations and $545,868 was spent on community development, Hookimaw says. They have 500 full-time employees with 100 from Attawapiskat First Nation. De Beers also employs Attawapiskat First Nation in winter road construction. The \\"mine employs 100 people from Attawapiskat at any one time. It generates about $400 million in annual revenue for the company.\\" Sub- contractors from Attawapiskat First Nation also work for the mine. \\"A federal review of the relationship between De Beers' Victor mine and Attawapiskat showed that government support for training and capacity did not start soon enough to deal with the huge lack of skills in the First Nation.\\" \\"Training is carried out on a year-round basis at the Victor Mine site as well as at the De Beers Canada Training Facility in Attawapiskat.\\" See also *De Beers *List of diamond mines *Lake Timiskaming kimberlite field *Northern Ontario References External links * Category:Diamond mines in Canada Category:Surface mines in Canada Category:Diatremes of Ontario Category:De Beers Category:Mines in Northern Ontario Category:2008 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Victor Diamond Mine"},{"id":"24980719","text":"R (on the application of L) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2009] UKSC 3, was a 2009 case heard by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Facts The appellant, L, obtained a job as a playground assistant. In connection with her employment, the police were required to provide her with an enhanced criminal records certificate (ECRC) in accordance with Section 115 of the Police Act 1997 (the 1997 Act). ECRCs are issued by the Secretary of State, and Section 115(7) of the 1997 Act requires the chief officer of every relevant police force to provide any information which might be relevant in considering a person's suitability for a position and which ought to be included in the certificate. In the ECRC, the police disclosed to the school that she had been accused of neglecting her child and non-cooperation with social services. As a consequence, her employment was terminated. The appellant sought judicial review of the decision to disclose the information contained in the ECRC. This application was dismissed by the High Court in March 2006. She appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed the appeal in March 2007. She then appealed to the House of Lords (the body which was replaced by the Supreme Court in October 2009), claiming that the police disclosure violated her right to respect for her private life under the Human Rights Act 1998 (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights). Judgment The court unanimously dismissed the appeal. Lord Hope, with whom Lord Saville concurred, first looked at whether the issue raised was within the scope of Article 8 at all. He held that it was as: (a) Respect for private life comprises, to a certain degree, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings. Excluding a person from employment in her chosen field is liable to affect her ability to develop relationships with others, and the problems that this creates with regards to the possibility of that person earning a living can have serious repercussions on the enjoyment of her private life. Dismissal could also damage her reputation and people are entitled to have their good name and reputation protected. (b) Public information can fall into the scope of private life when it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities. (c) The relevant information in the case related to private proceedings. Lord Hope concluded that the decisions which the chief officer of police is required to take under Section 115(7) of the 1997 Act are likely to fall within the scope of Article 8(1) in every case as the information which he would be considering has been stored in files held by the police. As such, its disclosure would be likely to affect the private life of the applicant in virtually every case. Lord Hope then went on to determine whether the interference with her private life could be justified. In determining whether information should be provided, Section 115(7) provided for a two-stage test for the chief officer, the second of which was that the information \\"ought\\" to be included. Lord Hope determined that at this stage, the chief officer must consider whether there is likely to be an interference with the applicant's private life and, if so, whether it could be justified. Section 115(7) itself was not in contravention of Article 8 so long as it was interpreted and applied in a proportionate way. Those who apply for ECRCs do not consent to their privacy rights being violated; consent is given on the basis that the right to respect for their private life would be respected. Lord Hope concluded that the words \\"ought to be included\\" in Section 115(7) required greater attention by the police who had, so far, given priority to the social need to protect the vulnerable as opposed to the right to respect for private life of applicants. Neither consideration should be afforded precedence over the other; careful consideration was required so as to ensure that the interference with the private life of the applicant was outweighed by the risk of non-disclosure. In future, the words were to be read and given effect in a way that was compatible with the applicant's Convention right and that of any third parties who may be affected by the disclosure. Furthermore, in cases of doubt ‚Äì i.e. where disclosure might be unnecessary, unreliable, or out-of-date ‚Äì the applicant should be given the opportunity to make representations before the information is released. On the facts of the case, however, Lord Hope concluded that the information that was disclosed was relevant for the purpose for which the ECRC was required. Insufficient weight was given to the appellant's right to respect for her private life when the decision to disclose was made, however, this did not change the fact that the risk to the children outweigh the prejudicial effect of disclosure. Lord Scott concluded that the issue did not fall within the scope of Article 8, and that there had been no interference: the information was relevant to the employment position in question, and it had not been suggested that the compilation and retention by the police of the details in question constituted a breach of Article 8. On this basis, Lord Scott found it difficult to see on what basis her attack on the inclusion of the details in the certificate could succeed. Lord Scott emphasised the fact it was she who applied for the certificate, and, as such, invited the chief police officer to exercise his duty under Section 115(7). Lord Scott disagreed with Lord Hope's conclusion that applications for ECRCs are sought \\"only on the basis that their right to private life is respected\\", concluding that almost all information disclosed would be information about private life, and if it is relevant and reasonable to include it, there could be no objection to its inclusion. Lord Brown agreed with the judgments of Lords Hope and Neuberger. Lord Neuberger first looked at whether the operation of Section 115 of the 1997 Act fell within the reach of Article 8 and concluded that it did on for a number of reasons: first, the basis that ECRCs would often have a highly significant effect on the applicant and, if adverse, would effectively shut off forever all employment opportunities for the applicants in a large number of different fields. Second, to be excluded from a large sector of the job market would frequently have a significant effect on one's private life in terms of career satisfaction, development of personal relationships and the ability to earn a living. Third, an adverse ECRC would involve the release of information concerning the applicant which is stored on public records (regardless of the fact that some of it may be in the public domain). In the present case, some of the information in the ECRC was not publicly available and not even based on events which had taken place in public. Lord Neuberger next looked at whether the applicant's Article 8 rights were infringed by Section 115 of the 1997 Act. Lord Neuberger concluded that were Section 115(7)(a) ‚Äì that the information \\"might be relevant\\" for the purposes of Section 115(2) ‚Äì the sole criterion for determining whether information be included in the ECRC then Article 8 would be infringed. However, given Section 115(7)(b) ‚Äì which also requires that the information \\"ought to be included\\" ‚Äì Article 8 was not infringed as this gives the opportunity for the balancing act required by Article 8 to be employed by the Chief Officer at this stage. He agreed with Lord Hope that the issue was essentially one of proportionality.

The theory was formulated by American airmen at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) in the 1930s. The term \\"industrial web theory\\" cannot be found in any official United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) doctrine.McMullen, John K. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey and Air Force Doctrine. Graduate thesis, School of Advanced Airpower Studies, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. 2001. Instead, the term was coined in the 1930s by Donald Wilson, an instructor at ACTS, to cover the concept then under development. Theory Muir S. Fairchild researched industrial interconnections. Prior theories of bombing were developed by Italian General Giulio Douhet, British Sir Hugh Trenchard and American Colonel Billy Mitchell, each of whom advocated bombing an enemy's population centers as a method of shortening wars and thus saving more lives than were taken. This theory of area bombardment was taught at ACTS until 1934 but was unpopular in the press and in government. In 1922, a treaty to limit aerial bombardment of civilians was written and promoted by the United States, called The Hague Rules of Air Warfare, but it was not adopted.The Hague Rules of Air Warfare, December 1922 to February 1923. This convention was never adopted. A similar international proposal was drafted in Tokyo in 1934 regarding the \\"Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,\\" but this, too, was not ratified by treaty. In 1935, ACTS instructors studied the probable results of area bombardment and concluded that not enough economic damage resulted from attacks on civilian population centers. Mitchell and the ACTS adjusted their bombing strategy to avoid direct attacks on civilians to be \\"more in keeping with our humanitarian ideals,\\" though the possibility of attacks on general population centers was retained as a \\"last resort.\\" The industrial web theory was based on the idea that the economic strength of an industrial nation is composed of interdependent sectors such as manufacturing, mining, utilities and transportation. Any one of the sectors could be targeted with bombs to make the whole system suffer breakdowns and shortages. From 1935, instructors such as Robert M. Webster and Muir S. Fairchild at ACTS studied the industrial interdependence of the United States as a model for targeting an aggressor enemy state. They drew up lists of optimal targets that would produce the greatest disruption for the least expenditure of bombs. Transportation and electric power industries were seen as vital targets, as well as iron ore mining and steel manufacturing.Finney, Robert T. (1998) Air Force History and Museums Program. History of the Air Corps Tactical School 1920‚Äì1940. Third imprint. Retrieved on November 3, 2009. Robert M. Webster listed iron ore, steel, electricity and transportation as appropriate targets. With the loss of an enemy's economic strength through crippling attack on a vital sector, the theory held that the enemy's will to fight would collapse and that they would surrender or be forced to the bargaining table. In 1934, six ACTS leaders appeared before the Howell Commission to advocate for an independent military air arm for the United States. Webster was joined by Donald Wilson, Robert Olds, Kenneth Walker, Claire Chennault, and Harold L. George‚Äîall six spoke about the critical opportunity that could be taken in attacking the cohesiveness of an enemy's industrial web.Johnson, David E. Fast Tanks and Heavy Bombers: Innovation in the U.S. Army, 1917‚Äì1945. Cornell studies in security affairs. Cornell paperbacks. Cornell University Press, 2003, pp. 160‚Äì162. George submitted his opinion that a bomber with a range would be available within two years. The Howell Commission (which would develop into the Federal Aviation Commission and then into the Federal Aviation Administration) was interested in the industrial web theory and in the possibility that an independent air arm might stop an enemy from making war. They authorized the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force) as a semi-independent arm within the United States Army. Industrial targets Traditional military targets had primarily been fielded enemy forcesRizer, Kenneth R. \\"Bombing Dual-Use Targets: Legal, Ethical, and Doctrinal Perspectives.\\" Air & Space Power Journal, May 1, 2001. Retrieved on November 6, 2009. and concentrations of supplies held in rear areas. After aerial bombardment became a possibility, tactical targets such as communications (supply and signal lines) and troop concentrations became the focus of bombing efforts. The industrial web theory instead targeted choke points and bottlenecks in an enemy's economic and industrial base, deep inside the interior of an enemy nation.Brauer, 2008, pp. 207‚Äì209. If precision bombing could be used to destroy an industrial node with resulting paralysis of enemy industry, the particular node was given serious consideration as a target. Suitable targets included railroad lines, junctions and marshaling areas, oil drilling and fuel refining industries, iron ore mining and transportation, steel refining and manufacturing industries, electric power generation and distribution, and, in general, all forms of transportation. Enemy morale A hold-over element of area bombardment strategies that was incorporated into the industrial web theory was that enemy morale would deteriorate in the face of bombing attacks that vitally reduced an enemy's economy. The enemy's will to resist would fail, and the enemy would surrender or would at least be forced to end the war by diplomatic means. In 1939, Fairchild said of a theoretical enemy that the \\"nation-wide reaction to the stunning discovery that the sources of the country's power to resist and to sustain itself are being relentlessly destroyed, can hardly fail to be decisive.\\" Weapons development Before the development of aerial warfare, especially the long-range heavy bomber, large-scale attacks on an enemy's industrial might were impossible. No military weapon system was able to penetrate deep into enemy territory and reliably deliver the quantity of munitions required to limit the enemy's ability to wage war. Zeppelin raids during World War I came near to achieving this capability‚Äîtheir bomb load and range were greater than any other aircraft‚Äîbut they were very vulnerable to weather and attack.Day, Lance and Ian McNeil. Biographical dictionary of the history of technology, p. 786. Taylor & Francis, 1996. Bombers and Zeppelins in World War I proved vulnerable to pursuit aircraft, so each of the belligerents quickly moved to a strategy of bombing at night when the attackers were much safer. However, night bombing suffered from imprecision in targeting. As early as 1926, American airmen noted that small targets which were difficult to see at night would have to be attacked in daylight hours. Still, night bombing was emphasized. In 1932, the staff at ACTS moved to embrace daylight bombing as the primary method to get the greatest bomb tonnage on target. To survive this kind of risky offensive action, the bombers would have to be flying higher than their pursuers, and higher than the effective range of anti-aircraft artillery. ACTS bombing proponents began calling for higher service ceilings for their bombers: for light bombers and for the heavy bombers. Y1B-17 Flying Fortress service test aircraft undergoing trials As well, bomber strategy began to emphasize the mutually supporting defensive fire of multiple machine guns found within a squadron of bombers flying in close formation. It was thought that bombers in formation were too difficult a target for defensive aircraft. Kenneth Walker lectured to his students in the Bombardment Section of ACTS: \\"Military airmen of all nations agree that a determined air attack, once launched, is most difficult, if not impossible to stop.\\" With the first successful trials of the Y1B-17 Flying Fortress service test aircraft in 1937, the ACTS was convinced that this aircraft could prove their theories. The new bomber could fly above , was faster and could carry a larger bomb load than any previous bomber. Its potential for use against targets deep within an enemy nation was far greater than any previous aircraft. These qualities combined with its massive amount of defensive firepower brought ACTS theorists to conclude that the B-17 bomber fleet was invincible, that it was indeed true that \\"The bomber will always get through\\", a phrase uttered in 1932 by Stanley Baldwin, 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley.\\"Mr. Baldwin on Aerial Warfare ‚Äì A Fear For The Future.\\" The Times newspaper, 11 November 1932, p. 7, column B. An instructional diagram of the Norden bombsight With increasing altitude, the circular error of probability (CEP) also increased, resulting in decreased damage to the target. Bombs dropped from high altitudes would fall over a wide area below, and in order for the bombers to significantly damage a target, the number of bombers would have to be prohibitively large. The Norden bombsight, tested in 1933, held the promise of much greater accuracy in high altitude bombing, and helped the ACTS theorists conclude that pinpoint bombing was possible. Results The industrial web theory was put into concrete plan form by the Air War Plans Division: Kenneth Walker, Laurence S. Kuter and Haywood S. Hansell, led by Harold L. George. The plan was submitted for approval to the Joint Army-Navy Board in mid-1941 as AWPD-1, standing for Air War Plans Division, plan number one.Nalty, 2003, pp. 187, 233. A refinement to AWPD-1 came in August 1942 after eight months of direct American involvement in World War II. The new plan was called AWPD-42 and was submitted to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Neither AWPD-1 nor AWPD-42 were approved as combat battle plans or strategies‚Äîthey were simply accepted as guidelines for the production of materiel necessary to carry out the plans intended or subsequent plans.Hansell, 1980, p. 155. Finally in 1943, a plan was hammered out in meetings between American and British war planners. The industrial web theory would be put into practical plan form with the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO).Hansell, 1980, pp. 157‚Äì194. In the event, the industrial web theory failed to achieve its goals.Lee, 1997, pp. 219‚Äì220. Various targets were chosen and attacked serially, without evaluating the results in light of their interdependence. American bombing leaders maintained that precision attacks were being carried out, but in early 1944 poor weather over Europe prevented visual sighting, and bombs were dropped indiscriminately by inaccurate radar methods through cloud cover, resulting in general population destruction. By September 1944, all pretense to precision was abandoned when General Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the area bombing of Berlin. By that time, bombing had become as much tactical as strategic, to soften Germany for invasion by ground troops. Thousand-bomber raids were not able to diminish industrial production of materiel in time to prevent invasion. When arms production in Germany finally faltered in the third quarter of 1944, only 30% of the total of eventual bomb tonnage had been dropped on the country‚Äîthis after the French-German border had been reached and the war on the ground had seen its decisive breakthrough. Germany was conquered by invasion; it did not surrender solely because of bombing. The morale of the enemy was not significantly affected‚Äîno population that was bombed in World War II lost their will to resist, and it was the Emperor, not the people, who decided Japan must surrender. Despite its failures in practice, the strategic bombing concept of targeting crucial industrial bottlenecks became in 1947 the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Strategic bombing proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. In the modern United States, Air Force strategic doctrine was redirected in the 1980s by Colonel John A. Warden III who developed his Strategic Ring Theory, a concept of aerial attack in which a number of enemy nodes are attacked simultaneously to result in \\"physical paralysis\\" or \\"strategic paralysis.\\" Warden's theory added fielded enemy military units and their leadership to the industrial web theory, and attacks on civilians were at most indirect ones, collateral damage, the result of targeted military and industrial nodes. However, USAF doctrine continues to emphasize the demoralization of the enemy: \\"Strategic attack objectives often include producing effects to demoralize the enemy‚Äôs leadership, military forces, and population, thus affecting an adversary‚Äôs capability to continue the conflict.\\" See also * Aerial bombardment and international law * Bomber mafia * Dehousing, British area bombardment doctrine * Strategic bombing during World War II References ;Notes ;Bibliography *Brauer, Jurgen and Hubert P.

He is the national hero of Argentina.TODAY IN HISTORY Ruiz, nicknamed Falucho, was an Afro-Argentine soldier of the Independence War. Ruiz fought in Jos√© de San Mart√≠n‚Äôs army. According to the most common story, Corporal Ruiz, born a slave (perhaps in Africa), served in the Regiment of the River Plate and died while defending the colors (white and light blue) of the revolutionary flag (later the Argentine flag) against traitors during a revolt at the fort of El Callao, Peru) on February 6, 1824. Rather than hoist the Spanish flag, Falucho chose to be shot by the traitors, crying out with his last breath, Viva Buenos Aires! (Long live Buenos Aires!).Encyclopedia of the African diaspora: origins, experiences, and culture NegroFalucho.jpgStatue of \\"Negro Falucho\\" in Buenos Aires, Argentina History The night of 1 to 2 February 1810, the garrison of El Callao, which was composed by the remains of Army of the Andes and an artillery company from Chile, started a mutiny, which was joined by two squadrons of the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment. These soldiers revolted because they were owed five months' pay, to what was said the day before had been paid the salaries of the officers, the desire to return home, either Buenos Aires or Chile, and the disgust of having to sail north to swell the army of Bolivar. Seeing the prevailing indiscipline, the mulatto Moyano, Olive accepts the suggestion of consulting Royalist Colonel Jose Mar√≠a Casariego, who was taken captive and lodged there. Casariego saw the advantage he could derive from the situation and advised to replace the patriot leaders by Spanish. Casariego convinces them to join the royal ranks where they would be rewarded, while the Patriots would receive punishment. In the midst of this disorder took place the remarkable story of Falucho. His story was first published on 14 May 1857 by Historian and politician Bartolom√© Mitre at Los Debates journal. The night of 3 February the black Falucho was a sentry in the tower of King Philip, which belonged to the Regiment of the River Plate. He was well known for their bravery and their patriotism. For many involved in the uprising, this had no further dimension than a mutiny in the barracks. Mitre tells that \\"While the dark-veiled sentinel was in the high castle tower, where rose the flagstick, which made few hours in the Argentine flag flew, Casariego the rebels decided to fly the Spanish flag in the dark the night before that they should repent of his resolution. \\"At that point come before the black Falucho, soldiers with the Spanish standard against which they fought for 14 years. Falucho could not believe it, and feeling totally humiliated sinks to the ground and weeps bitterly. The soldiers with orders to raise the Spanish flag, ordered Falucho to salute the flag of the King who was going to fly. Falucho answered sadly getting the gun he had dropped \\"I can not do honor to the flag against which I will fight forever,\\" then the mutineers shout at him: \\"Revolution!\\" Revolutionary! \\". According to Mitre, Falucho answers them: \\"Being a revolutionary is not evil, I prefer to be a revolutionary rather than a traitor! (...) And taking his rifle by the barrel, smashed against the flagstick, giving back to more grief. The executors of the betrayal seized Falucho immediately and shot four rounds at point blank on his chest and head. Before falling mortally wounded on the ground, Falucho cried Viva Buenos Aires!. Mitre wrote that Falucho was born in Buenos Aires and his real name was Antonio Ruiz. The story was republished by Mitre in La Naci√≥n newspaper on 6, 7, 8 and 9 April 1875. He later published the book \\"History of San Martin and American emancipation\\". Regarding Falucho, Mitre writes: \\"The Spanish flag was hoisted on the tower Independence, with an overall saving of castles (February 7). A black soldier from the regiment of the Rio de la Plata, born in Buenos Aires named Antonio Ruiz (whose surname Falucho), who struggled to do justice, was shot at the foot of the Spanish flag. He died shouting Viva Buenos Aires! \\". Bartolom√© Mitre take as the basis the oral testimony of General Enrique Martinez, director of the Division of the Andes, the testimony of Colonel Pedro Jose D√≠az and Pedro Luna, and the written testimony of Colonel Juan Espinosa. Mitre say then that there were two black soldiers dubbed Falucho, apparently it was a generic nickname given to the black people in the army. Since the first publication of Mitre, his account rose critics and detractors. In 1899, Manuel J. Mantilla wrote in his book Los Negros Argentinos stating that there were two Faluchos, Ruiz, whose fate was recalled by Martinez and Diaz-Espinosa, and another who lived in Lima in 1830, according to Miller's letter to San Martin del 20 August that year. Miller named him saying \\"the morenito Falucho, which served in the 8 Company of Sharpshooters and took a flag in Maip√∫\\". According to historian Mantilla in 1819, there was a second Antonio Ruiz among the members of the Company of Captain Manuel D√≠az, while in that of Pedro Jos√© D√≠az there wasn't a soldier of that name. Many authors claim that the heroic death of Falucho was an invention of Mitre. In light of all existing evidence. The only thing we know for sure is that a black soldier died heroically in El Callao while refusing to honor the Spanish royal flag. But certainly, this soldier was not Falucho. Falucho was a black soldier in the 8th Battalion of the Army of the Andes that was possibly the 'second' Antonio Ruiz. This soldier was well known to San Martin and Guido and lived in Lima in 1830.-EL SOLDADO FALUCHO- References Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1824 deaths Category:Argentine military personnel killed in the Argentine War of Independence Category:People of the Spanish American wars of independence Category:People of the Argentine War of Independence Category:People of the Latin American wars of independence Category:Deaths by firearm in Peru ","title":"Antonio Ruiz (soldier)"},{"id":"24981105","text":"Hester Margaret Kaplan is an American short story writer, and novelist.

Sydney Uni Baseball Club is a part of Sydney University Sport and Fitness, an organisation whose history dates back to 1852. Sydney Uni Sport & Fitness has produced more Australian representatives and won more major competitions than any other club. SUBC enters three teams in the Sydney Winter Baseball League, which is the highest calibre competition in the state for the winter season. The club also enters a fourth team into the Pacific Coast Baseball League. The History of Sydney Uni Baseball Club The NSW baseball competition was established in , and the club's affiliation was made and the club constituted in . Foundation years 1912 SUBC First Grade Details of the club's first game are not known but the second game was played against Waverley, formed in 1898. The Club was formed to give cricketers who did not play football or row, a way to keep fit in the winter months. The first President was the registrar H.E. Barff, secretary was Dr J.S. Harris, the prime mover in the formation of the club, and treasurer was G.T. Balcombe. In the inaugural season, the team was entered in the second grade of NSW Baseball Association (NSWBA), and won 10 from 12 games. The club played home games on Rushcutters Bay Oval, and trained twice a week on The Square, where the club still trains today 105 years later. In 1907 A.D. Watson was selected to represent Australia against the representatives of the American Fleet. In 1911 F.E. McElhone, A.D. Watson and C.V. Single represented NSW in all three games against Victoria, while R. Campling and F.M. Farrar represented NSW against Tasmania. While most other clubs in the University suspended participation in competitions during World War I, the baseball club was an exception and continued playing. In fact in 1916, playing its home games on the University Oval, the club won its first championship by winning the first grade district championship and hence the Proud Shield, by defeating Petersham 12-7 in the final. 1920s 1920 SUBC First Grade1923 proved to be an important year for the Club for two reasons. First, the club played its first inter-varsity match, sending a team to play Adelaide University and secondly, it was the first time since its inception that the Club fielded three teams in the NSWBA. In 1926 there was a triangular series held between Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne universities. Sydney took out the series undefeated and managed to do the same the following year. In 1927, Jack Mould - the first grade captain at the time, who the Club MVP trophy is now named after - was chosen to captain NSW. He has a Blue for baseball, and was later patron of the club from 1941 to 1983. Mould was associated with the Club for over 60 years as a player, administrator and coach. In 1928 Sydney Uni engaged in the first international University match in Australia, playing Stanford University. The tourists defeated Sydney 5-2. Stanford then played a combined Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide team, comprehensively defeating the Australians 31-6. 1950s and 1960s Also in 1962 Jeffrey, A. Alderson and F. Hampshire were selected to compete for NSW in the Claxton Shield in Perth. In 1966 one of the highlights for the club was the inter-varsity held in Sydney. Seven Universities contested, with all games being played on the two ovals. Sydney took out the title undefeated to take the Hugh J. Ward Cup for the first time since 1957. 1970s In fact, 1973 proved to be probably the most successful season to date. Under the presidency of Alan Compton, the Club won both the first grade premiership and intervarsity. Overall the club was first grade premier, first grade pennant winner (minor premiers), joint club champion (with Mosman) and intervarsity Champion, while Ian Anderson received the Fred Bachall trophy for NSW 'player of the year' for the second straight year. Ron Finlay, the former chairman of the Australian Baseball Federation, was declared MVP for the intervarsity tournament. Neil Barrowcliff was another notable representative player from the era. Modern era 2009 First Grade Squad University Games right Since its inception in 1993, the Australian University Games have always been very popular. Sydney University sport has long been the premier Sporting University in the country, and has won eight overall titles, and until 2008 remained the only University to win the title away from home, in Perth 2004. 2006 proved to be the most successful year for the baseball team. On the back of a lot of new blood in the team featuring players such as Scholarship holders Jonathon Freeston and Stephen Smith, Sydney Uni won the Eastern Uni Games, defeating University of New South Wales by mercy rule in the final, to pick up Sydney Uni Baseball's first gold in Uni Games history. The team then headed to Adelaide for the Australian Games and went through the competition undefeated, with an emphatic win over Monash in the final, to be crowned National Champions for the first time. The Cynics continued their Uni Games dominance over the next few years, with a silver medal in 2008, and added another gold to the collection in 2009, with an 8-5 win over Griffith University. This cemented Sydney Uni's position as the champion University team in the country, with three gold and a silver in the past four years. Pictured right is also the 84-year-old trophy that Uni Games Baseball teams compete for each year. The trophy was originally awarded to the combined University team that played against the touring American Army Team in 1925, after sweeping the tourists in a best of three series. It has since been awarded annually to the Inter Varsity/Uni Games champion since the early 1940s. Sydney Uni Baseball Club Awards The Club MVP award speaks for itself, recognising the most valuable player in the club, who is usually always the 1st grade MVP also. The award is named after Jack Mould who was associated with the Club for over 60 years as a player, administrator and coach. In 1927 Mould was chosen to captain NSW. He has a Blue for baseball, and was patron of the club from 1941 to 1983. The Stump Award is awarded annually to the individual who has displayed the greatest spirited performance to the club over the course of the year, which is basically the best and fairest. The stump is actually a part of the tree that hangs over first base and was donated by Pam Garrett, the mother of Phil Garret, who one of the best players of the club during the 1980s and 1990s, and a utility on the best Cynics team from 1971 to 2004. The Jennie Finlay Encouragement Award is traditionally awarded to a first or second year student of The University of Sydney as a 'rookie of the year' type of award. Jenny Finlay is the wife of club stalwart Ron Finlay who was a long-standing player, president and patron of the baseball club. The David Hynes Club Batting Champion Award was introduced in 2009, in honour of the baseball achievements and long term support of the Club by David Hynes. David was the recipient of the very first scholarship awarded by the Sydney Uni Sport Union back in the early 1990s. David went on to represent Australia at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he posted the second highest batting in the tournament. David is also a Sponsor of the Ron Rushbrooke Foundation and has long been a supporter of both the Club and Sydney Uni Sport. David is also the starting first-basemen in the Sydney Uni team of the century and currently the Chairman of Baseball Australia. The Neil Barrowcliff Gold Glove Award was also introduced in 2009 to commemorate the career of former state and Australian representative Neil Barrowcliff. Neil played 12 seasons for NSW at Claxton Shield level and represented Australia on 3 occasions. Neil was selected in the Sydney Uni team of the century as a starting outfielder and was the guest speaker at our centenary dinner back in 2004. Scholarships Sydney Uni Baseball Club offers opportunities which are simply not available at the majority of other clubs in Sydney Baseball. Students of The University of Sydney open themselves to the opportunity to apply for scholarships, while representing the Club. Students who are accepted into The University of Sydney and play baseball for Sydney Uni Baseball Club are assisted in their application for Elite Athlete Scholarships. Elite Athlete Scholarship Sydney Uni Sport and Fitness Scholarship holders are eligible to receive Financial Assistance which may range from $1,000 to $10,000 per annum, Representative Travel Grants of up to $2000, Personal Development, Tutoring, Academic Representation and Liaison, Academic Counselling, Media Exposure, Facility Access, Sport Services and the Elite Athlete and Performers Scheme. Talented Athlete Program (TAP) Awarded to those athletes with recognised potential. Benefits, as outlined above, include; Personal Development, Tutoring Academic, Representation and Liaison, Academic Counselling, Media Exposure, Facility Access, Sport Services, Athlete Mentoring. Ron Rushbrooke Scholarship The Ron Rushbrooke Scholarship Fund originated as a bequest from Mr Rushbrooke in 2004. The Fund is a vehicle to ensure the perpetual viability of Varsity baseball, with the aim to raise the invested principal to a level sufficient to cover the Club's expected regular season liabilities, and the perpetual scholarship, from the flow of Fund investment income. The Ron Rushbrooke Scholarship is available to students of The University, who may not meet all selection criteria for the Elite Athlete Scholarship, as set out by SUSF, yet still prove to be a great asset to the Club, through both on field play, and off field contributions.

Typically, this process is used to mitigate interference on communication satellites. Usually, these interference signals are caused by human error or equipment failure, but can also be caused by deliberate jamming. Identifying the geographical location of an interfering signal informs the mitigation activity. How Satellite Geolocation Works Many communication satellites share a given frequency band. As a signal is transmitted to a particular satellite there is some amount of side lobe or spillover energy that is transmitted to adjacent satellites. At a receive station that has two antennas, one pointed at the primary satellite (the satellite the signal is intended for) and a secondary satellite (a satellite that is receiving side lobe energy), both paths of the signal are received and measured. From a comparison of those paths, two measurements can be made: Differential Time Offset (DTO) and Differential Frequency Offset (DFO). These measurements are often implemented through correlation processing. DTO represents the difference in time that it takes the signal to travel through the two satellites, while DFO represents the difference in frequency the received signals present through the two satellites. The frequency differences observed are due to different Doppler shift resulting from relative satellite motion and differences in the translation frequencies of the two satellite channels. Channel translation frequencies and downlink Doppler shift and delay can be calibrated out of the measurements by observing transmitters of known location simultaneously on the channels. This leaves the uplink DTO and DFO as the observables. See 'Reference Signals' below. Lines of Position Once a DTO calculated, it can be combined with the known position of the satellites and the receiving station. This combination provides a locus of positions on the Earth‚Äôs surface for the source of the signal; from this result a line of position (LOP) can be derived. A similar line can be derived for the frequency differences. Where the two LOPs intersect is the signal transmission location. In addition to geolocation with a time LOP and a frequency LOP, a location can also be determined by finding the crossing point of two time LOPs. The second time LOP is an identical measurement using a different secondary satellite, or using the same secondary satellite, but later in time. Similarly, two frequency LOPs can be used to determine a location. It can be shown that, in general, it is expected that the two LOPs intersect in two places. In many circumstances it is possible to discount one of the intersections e.g. due to it not being in the coverage area of one or both satellites. In some circumstances, it is not possible to distinguish intersections from a pair of LOPs, in which case, additional LOPs need to be determined. Reference Signals While measuring the DTO and DFO will give you an idea of the location of the signal source, the location will be inaccurate. There are many biases within the measurement system that, if not accounted for properly, will manifest themselves as time delays or frequency offsets. For example, while a satellite translation frequency is known to within a few kHz, accurate geolocation requires frequency measurement accuracies of single mHz. In order to determine the position of signal source, a second set of measurements is required. Typically, this is done by making DTO and DFO measurements for a reference signal simultaneous with the target signal measurement. The measurement of the reference signal is purely passive and simply serves to remove the biases in the system. The same measurements that are made for the target signal, DTO and DFO, are made for the reference signal. The key to a reference signal is that the transmit location of that signal is known. By comparing the DTO of the reference signal and the DTO of the target signal a result known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) can be calculated. Likewise, from the DFO of the target and the DFO of the reference signal, a Frequency Difference of Arrival (FDOA) can be determined. The TDOA and FDOA results provide a finite number of locations on the Earth‚Äôs surface, and therefore, lines of position (LOPs) are determined from the TDOA and FDOA results. A limitation as to how accurately a location can be obtained is knowledge of the satellites' positions and velocities generated by the satellite ephemerides (orbit descriptors). A single reference geographically close to the target will give a high degree of cancellation of the location effects of ephemeris error. Measurements on signals from multiple reference sites can be used to improve the accuracy of the satellite ephemerides thereby provided improved geolocation accuracy generally. Various Geolocation Methods TDOA and FDOA results can be gathered and combined in various methods to produce geolocation results. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages in different measurement scenarios. Animation showing the relationship between TDOA and FDOA lines with respect to satellite motion over a 24-hour period. Note the limited movement of the TDOA lines compared with the drastic movement of the FDOA lines. TDOA-TDOA Geolocation TDOA-TDOA geolocation is performed, generally, by measuring DTO values using two secondary satellites, or three total satellites. By doing this, two TDOA lines are generated, hopefully, with a crossing point. TDOA ‚Äì TDOA geolocation is ideal for moving targets, since the movement of the target will introduce varying and random frequency changes, causing an FDOA result to be useless, unless obtained from a highly inclined satellite. TDOA-TDOA geolocation will not work for unmodulated signals. Due to the repetitive nature of the signal, no unique TDOA solution will exist. One problem with using only TDOA lines of position is that they tend to be north- south orientated and close to parallel, so that the ‚Äúcrossing point‚Äù of a TDOA-TDOA measurement can be error prone and uncertain, as it is ‚Äúhidden‚Äù in a long intersection of the lines. Care is also necessary in interpreting the results from moving targets if the two TDOA observations are not obtained simultaneously since the target will have moved between observations. FDOA- FDOA Geolocation FDOA-FDOA geolocation is accomplished by using three satellites, or by using time separated measurements on two satellites. The time separation can be as little as 5 minutes or as much as an hour or more. Again, the two FDOA lines are used to find a crossing point, or target location. FDOA-FDOA geolocation is necessary for CW signals. Geolocation on highly inclined satellites, either one of both being used in the measurement, will result in more accurate results by performing FDOA ‚Äì FDOA geolocation. This is due to a large difference in relative motion, leading to a large difference in relative frequency between the two satellites. A related point is the error to FDOA-FDOA calculation contributed by ephemeris uncertainty is relatively small. Moving targets are not likely to be located using FDOA methods, unless using a highly inclined satellite. FDOA ‚Äì FDOA geolocation has an interesting weakness in that for some amount of time per day, the two satellites used have very little differential frequency. This is due to the cyclical movement of the satellites. During those periods, FDOA measurements will not be ideal. In addition, the small amount of frequency difference being measured is much harder to accurately measure than the time differences. TDOA-FDOA Geolocation TDOA-FDOA geolocation, in most scenarios, gives ideal results. By combining time lines, which, generally, are oriented north- south, and frequency lines, which, generally, are orientated east-west, you get a nearly perpendicular crossing. A perpendicular crossing means less uncertainty in the calculated location. TDOA-FDOA geolocation also has an interesting limitation in that there are generally two times per day, separated by around 12 hours, where the FDOA becomes very small and hard to relate to an accurate LOP. These times can be calculated based on known satellite ephemeris information and approximate transmitter location, and can therefore be avoided when taking FDOA measurements. The process of geolocating a signal requires some knowledge of the signal and all the techniques in order to get an accurate location. The geolocation of a CW signal is nearly impossible with TDOA-FDOA. Nevertheless, a nominally CW transmission can contain imperfections, especially if a station transmits near its maximum EIRP. Hence, it often has a phase noise component which might be recognized as a modulated signal and therefore used to make TDOA measurements. However, it is generally more accurate to locate a CW carrier using FDOA-FDOA geolocation, even for non inclined satellites. This is especially used today whenever high power CW jamming of actual full power multiplex transmissions occurs.

Rucker (1857-1931) and Bethel J. Rucker (1862‚Äì1945) were pioneering entrepreneurs who helped to found the city of Everett, Washington. Originally from Noble County, Ohio, in 1888 the Rucker brothers moved to Tacoma, Washington, along with their mother Jane Morris Rucker (1830‚Äì1907). The following year they moved north to the Port Gardner peninsula, the site that would become Everett. The Ruckers purchased most of the land on the peninsula with plans to create a port and city there. They hoped that the site, near the mouth of the Snohomish River, would attract the Great Northern Railway, which was then building track toward Puget Sound. The Ruckers were soon followed by Tacoma lumberman and investor Henry Hewitt, Jr. who had similar ambitions. Hewitt had lined up a group of wealthy investors, led by Charles Colby and Colgate Hoyt and backed by John D. Rockefeller. With their capital he formed the Everett Land Company, which began investing in land, construction, and other business needed by a new city. The Ruckers became partners in the company, selling about half of their land and retaining the rest. Speculation in Everett was intense, and the new city was built quickly, but the boom turned to bust when it was announced that the Great Northern would establish its West Coast terminus at Seattle instead of Everett. The Rucker brothers survived the economic downturn, and when Rockefeller and his colleagues were ready to divest themselves of their failed investment, the Ruckers helped arrange the deal by which the Everett Land Company's interests were sold to a new entity, the Everett Improvement Company, controlled by the Great Northern's James J. Hill. Wyatt Rucker became treasurer of the new company. Everett and Monte Cristo Railway Prosperity returned to Everett around 1900, and the Rucker brothers were among the city's leading citizens, with extensive investments in local real estate, banks, and other ventures. Among these ventures was the Rucker Brothers Timber Company, which operated a sawmill in nearby Lake Stevens and several timber camps to the east. These were serviced by the former Everett and Monte Cristo Railway, a line which had been built to access a large mining operation at Monte Cristo, high in the Cascade Mountains to the east. The mine and the railway were another speculative venture by Colby and Hoyt, financed by Rockefeller. When it, too, proved unprofitable, Rockefeller withdrew his investment, and in 1903 the railway came into the possession of the Northern Pacific Railway. The Ruckers then leased the line from Northern Pacific and ran it under the name Hartford Eastern (named for Hartford, a small town near Lake Stevens). Their primary interest was in servicing their own timber operations, but they also provided cargo and passenger service to others. Big Four Inn with rail car The scenic mountain railway became popular with tourists from Everett, some of whom stayed at the Ruckers' hotel in the mining town of Silverton, Washington. Inspired by this, the Ruckers built a grand upscale mountain resort, the Big Four Inn (named for the nearby Big Four Mountain), completed in 1921. The Inn was well supplied with modern amenities and featured a nine-hole golf course, tennis courts, and an artificial lake. The Inn prospered, but the railway remained a financial burden on the Ruckers. It became worse in 1925 when their lease expired and the Ruckers were forced to purchase the line from the Northern Pacific. In 1929, they sold the railway. The Big Four Inn was sold as well, and changed ownership several times before it was destroyed by fire in 1949. Legacy The Rucker mansion in Everett, Washington A major thoroughfare in Everett is named Rucker Avenue. The Rucker mansion, a three- story, brick home built on a hill overlooking Puget Sound (412 Laurel Drive, Everett),Snohomish County public records, Assessor's Office was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Legend says that the home, completed in 1905, was a present for Bethel's bride, Ruby Brown, whom he had married the year before, but it also served as home for several additional members of the family. The house is currently a privately owned residence. Members of the Rucker family are buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Everett, where they are memorialized by the Rucker Monument, a granite pyramid commissioned by Wyatt and Bethel in 1907 to honor their mother. Two of Bethel's great-grandchildren, Rod Armstrong and Anne Armstrong, live in California, and an adopted great-grandson, William Rucker, lives in Everett. In popular culture Musician Jason Webley and several other collaborators produced a live performance with invited musicians and a later album entitled Margaret (2014), which was inspired by and memorializes Margaret Rucker, an accomplished poet and daughter of Bethel Rucker. She is also interred in the Rucker pyramid.

The Division was formed with the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.http://www.dol.gov/whd/about/history/whdhist.htm The Wage and Hour mission is to promote and achieve compliance with labor standards to protect and enhance the welfare of the Nation's workforce. WHD protects over 144 million workers in more than 9.8 million establishments throughout the United States and its territories. The Wage and Hour Division enforces over 13 laws, most notably the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family Medical Leave Act. In FY18, WHD recovered $304,000,000 in back wages for over 240,000 workers. History The Wage and Hour Division was created with the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. The Division is responsible for the administration and enforcement of a wide range of laws which collectively cover virtually all private and State and local government employment. The Division has a nationwide staff of investigators, supervisors, and technical and clerical employees responsible for enforcing FLSA, Government Contracts labor standards statutes, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 also provided certain additional enforcement responsibilities to be undertaken by the Wage and Hour Division staff.  Laws Administered and Enforced  FLSA: The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is the federal law commonly known for minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, recordkeeping, and special minimum wage standards applicable to most private and public employees. FLSA provides the agency with civil and criminal remedies, and also includes provisions for individual employees to file private lawsuits. The 1989 Amendments to FLSA added a provision for civil money penalties (CMP) for repeated or willful minimum wage or overtime violations. (Since 1974, FLSA has contained a similar CMP provision for child labor violations.) FMLA: The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. At the employee's or employer's option, certain kinds of paid leave may be substituted for unpaid leave. Employees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least one year, and for 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months, and if there are at least 50 employees within 75 miles. The employee may be required to provide advance leave notice and medical certification. For the duration of FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employee's health coverage under any group health plan. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is authorized under 29 U.S.C. 207, et seq. to administer and enforce a variety of laws that establish the minimum standards for wages and working conditions in the United States. Collectively, these labor standards cover most private, state, and local government employment. WHD's mission is to ‚Äúpromote and achieve compliance with labor standards to protect and enhance the welfare of the Nation‚Äôs workforce.‚Äù WHD is instrumental in promoting access to opportunities‚Äî opportunities for employers to compete on a level playing field; opportunities for workers to move into the middle class; and opportunities for workers to balance their family and work obligations. WHD has a nationwide staff of investigators, supervisors, analysts, technicians, and administrative employees who share responsibility for enforcing and administering the minimum wage, overtime, child labor, and break time for nursing mothers provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA); the prevailing wage requirements and wage determination provisions of the Davis- Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) and the McNamara-O‚ÄôHara Service Contract Act (SCA); the wages and working conditions under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA); the job protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA); and the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA). WHD also enforces the field sanitation and temporary labor camp standards in agriculture and certain employment standards and worker protections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). These laws protect over 135 million workers in more than 7.3 million establishments throughout the United States and its territories. Government Contracts: The Government Contracts statutes set labor standards for wages and hours of work for employees who work on contracts with the Federal government. The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBA) & (DBRA) cover workers on Federal construction contracts, and on construction contracts with State and local governments that are Federally financed or assisted, in whole or in part. The McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA) applies to workers on Federal service contracts, and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (PCA) applies to workers on Federal supply contracts. MSPA: The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) sets standards for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers regarding wages, housing, and transportation. MSPA requires that contractors of migrant agricultural workers register with the Federal government, and notify prospective workers of the wages and working conditions before they are hired. MSPA also requires that providers of housing to such workers comply with certain minimum standards for health and safety, and that transportation providers have vehicles that meet certain standards for safety. Non-immigrant Workers: Wage and Hour has certain responsibilities under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). These include enforcement of the labor standards protections for certain temporary nonimmigrant workers admitted to the U.S. under several programs (D-1, Crewmembers; H-1B, Professional and Specialty Occupation Workers; H-1C, Nurses; H-2B Non-Agricultural Workers; and H-2A Agricultural Workers). EPPA: The Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA) prohibits most private employers (Federal, State, and local government employers are exempted from the Act) from using any lie detector tests either for pre-employment screening or during the course of employment. Polygraph tests, but no other types of lie detector tests, are permitted under limited circumstances subject to certain restrictions. CCPA: The wage garnishment provisions of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) protect employees from discharge by their employers because their wages have been garnished for any one debt, and it limits the amount of an employee's earnings that may be garnished in any one week. CCPA also applies to all employers and individuals who receive earnings for personal services (including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses and income from a pension or retirement program, but ordinarily not including tips).

WHD also enforces the field sanitation and temporary labor camp standards in agriculture and certain employment standards and worker protections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). These laws protect over 135 million workers in more than 7.3 million establishments throughout the United States and its territories. Given the scope of the agency's responsibilities, WHD must make the most of its limited resources by focusing its enforcement and compliance assistance efforts to achieve the greatest impact. The division uses data and evidence to identify areas and industries in which serious violations may be widespread, despite a lack of complaints, and often organizes educational and enforcement initiatives in those areas. WHD complements enforcement with outreach and education to employers. By partnering with industry and employers to produce meaningful compliance assistance, WHD can increase compliance with the laws it enforces. Employers can anticipate and plan when the agency provides them with resources and information concerning the Nation's wage and workplace standards. Employers and employees benefit when businesses manage costs through innovation and efficiencies rather than by violating the law, undercutting workers and other businesses. By combining enforcement with education, more workers in this country can obtain stable and secure income and responsible businesses can succeed. *Wage and hour laws provide a basic level of economic security to the nation's workers and allow them to earn enough wages to purchase goods and services to support themselves and their families. The economic security of the nation's workforce also supports America's businesses and economy as a whole. To protect fair and vigorous competition, WHD addresses compliance issues systemically and deters violations through compliance assistance to reach a broader audience. The combination of enforcement and compliance assistance increases compliance with the laws and makes workers who have experienced wage violations whole. Compliance assistance to the employer community is a central component of WHD's efforts to meet its mission. Through direct engagement with industry leaders at a national, regional, and local level, WHD has developed productive relationships that have resulted in meaningful partnerships and compliance assistance tools that have been well received by the employer community. In the process, rather than relying on traditional text-heavy fact sheets and Power Point presentations, WHD has had early success transitioning into the use of modern compliance assistance methods and has used innovative ways to share information including visual design, infographics, videos, interactive web-based tools, and language that is tailored to the employer audience and accessible and usable in multiple contexts and formats. For example, by analyzing data on incoming compliance assistance questions and most frequently visited webpages, as well as through discussions with major industry associations, WHD recognized a need to develop more employer-friendly information regarding the FMLA. WHD collaborated with industry stakeholders to produce an easy-to-understand FMLA Employer Guide2 that has been distributed widely through industry channels. While these efforts have received universal support from stakeholders, WHD has been unable to expand on these successful models due to resource limitations. Demand for accessible information about the laws WHD enforces remains high; in FY 2016 alone WHD's webpages were viewed more than 35 million times. Additional funds would be used to expand on these efforts to modernize compliance assistance information and allow WHD to reach and inform a broader audience, increasing compliance with the laws WHD enforces.

Constitution A fire and rescue authority was by default the council of a council area as defined in s.2 Local Government (Scotland) Act 1994. With the exception of Fife and of Dumfries and Galloway, the powers and functions were all exercised by joint fire and rescue boards, which combined the responsibilities of two or more councils; these boards mostly covered the land areas of the local authorities which existed in Scotland from 1975 to 1996. Funding Provision of \\"equipment, etc.\\" could be made by the Scottish Ministers as they saw fit from time to time. In 2002 80% of FRA funding was from aggregate external finance (the total of government grants, non-domestic rates and specific grants distributed by the Scottish Government among local authorities as revenue support grant) and 20% from Council Tax. Functions An authority's principal functions were defined in Chapter 2 of the FSA 2005 and include promotion of fire safety, provision of fire-fighting services, rescue and protection at road traffic accidents and dealing with such other emergencies and matters as they are directed by the Scottish Ministers. As ancillary functions an authority could also take any other action which it deemed necessary to save human life, prevent illness or injury to humans or to protect the environment (including any animals, plants and buildings). Powers and duties of an authority An authority was permitted to provide education and training centres in relation to its functions. An authority could impose a non-profit charge for any service for which the Scottish Ministers imposed a charging order. An authority had a duty to take \\"reasonable measures\\" to ensure an adequate water supply for most of its own purposes. An authority had a duty to co-operate (voluntarily or as directed by the Scottish Ministers) by way of a 'reinforcement scheme' with other authorities for purposes of mutual assistance. An authority could also arrange for persons other than a fire and rescue service to perform some functions subject to the over-riding authority of the Scottish Ministers. Powers and duties of an \\"authorised employee\\" of an authority An \\"authorised employee\\" was an employee of a relevant authority who was authorised in writing to perform the following functions and actions as specified in various sections of FSA 2005. An authorised employee of an authority who was on duty was permitted to do anything which he \\"reasonably believes\\" to protect life and/or property. This includes the power to break into premises or vehicles, move vehicles without the owner's consent, interfere with the free movement of traffic and to prevent people entering any premises or place. An authorised employee could enter premises and seek information relevant to the authority's functions. A sheriff's warrant could be obtained to allow such entry and any associated force if reasonable access was not given. An authorised employee who had entered premises has a duty to leave them no less secure than they were found. Government supervision The Scottish Ministers were responsible for providing guidance to FRAs regarding their priorities and objectives in carrying out their functions. Inspection of FRAs was carried out by a Chief Inspector of Fire and Rescue Authorities (appointed by an Order in Council), inspectors and assistant inspectors (both the latter appointed by the Scottish Ministers). Abolition With the formation of the single Scottish Fire and Rescue Service the fire and rescue authorities ceased to exist.

A number of tools are available to convert text written using sumihiri to Sinhala script, if desired. History Sumihiri was developed for a project that allowed typesetting Sinhala documents using the LaTeX Document Preparation System. That project involved creating a Sinhala font using Metafont and tools that converted text written in sumihiri into TeX commands that print the corresponding Sinhala script. A paper published in 1995 described the rules of sumihiri.‡∂¢‡∂Ω‡∂∫ Design Criteria of sumihiri The design of sumihiri was guided by the following principles: # It must be possible to write any modern Sinhala word without ambiguity. # As far as possible, common conventions that are being used to write Sinhala names using English keyboard must be retained. # It must be rather easy and effortless to write for someone familiar with the standard English keyboard. # It must be possible to read and correctly pronounce text written using 'sumihiri'. # Typing must be kept to a minimum. Design of sumihiri tries to achieve the above, sometimes conflicting, goals. Base Letters 'sumihiri' distinguishes between the two '‡∂∏' letters in the Sinhala word '‡∂∏‡∂∏'. This is to facilitate correct pronouncing of text written using 'sumihiri'. The first '‡∂∏', which has an 'open' sound is written as 'ma', whereas the second '‡∂∏', which has a 'closed' sound is written as 'me'. Although this will have no effect in printing applications (both print the letter '‡∂∏'), it is highly recommended to stick to this usage. Most of the base letters are obtained in an obvious way (note that 'e' could be used instead of 'a' to print the same letter): ka - ‡∂ö, ga - ‡∂ú, ja - ‡∂¢, ta - ‡∂ß, da - ‡∂©, na - ‡∂±, pa - ‡∂¥, ba - ‡∂∂, ma - ‡∂∏, ya - ‡∂∫, ra - ‡∂ª, la - ‡∂Ω, wa - ‡∑Ä, sa - ‡∑É, ha - ‡∑Ñ Some require two letters: cha - ‡∂†, tha - ‡∂≠, dha - ‡∂Ø, sha - ‡∑Å A capitalized version is used for '‡∂∏‡∑Ñ‡∂¥‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª‡∑è‡∂´' letters: Ka - ‡∂õ, Cha - ‡∂°, Ga - ‡∂ù, Tha - ‡∂Æ, Dha - ‡∂∞, Pa - ‡∂µ, Ba - ‡∂∑ Nasal letters: Nga - ‡∂ü, Nda - ‡∂¨, Ndha - ‡∂≥, Mba - ‡∂π Some others: La - ‡∑Ö, Na - ‡∂´, Sha - ‡∑Ç, xa - ‡∂ö‡∑ä‚Äç‡∑Ç‚Äç, qa - ‡∂§, GNa - ‡∂• Special Letters NG - ‡∂Ç, H - ‡∂É Vowel Sounds Short vowel sounds are as follows: a - ‡∂Ö, z - ‡∂á, i - ‡∂â, u - ‡∂ã, E - ‡∂ë, o - ‡∂î Long vowel sounds are as follows: aa - ‡∂Ü, zz - ‡∂à, ii - ‡∂ä, uu - ‡∂å, ee - ‡∂í, oo - ‡∂ï Some remarks are in order: In a radical approach, sumihiri uses the English letter 'z' to represent the '‡∂á' vowel sound. Not only is 'z' easy to type frequently but it also resembles the decoration '‡∂á‡∂Ø‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∂Ω' to some extent. Alternative transliteration schemes tend to use the two letter combination 'ae' for the same purpose. In those schemes, the corresponding longer vowel is represented with the letter combination 'ei', whereas in sumihiri, it is 'zz' which follows the rule of duplicating the letter to get the longer vowel. Thus the 'sumihiri' convention implies less effort in typing, too. The other remark concerns the use of 'E' for the '‡∂ë' sound. 'E' is used for this as we have used the 'e' to indicate the closed '‡∂Ö' sound (see above). However, the corresponding long vowel sound is still indicated by 'ee'. Furthermore, the following vowel sounds exist: ai - ‡∂ì, au - ‡∂ñ Other Letters Other forms of Sinhala letters are created by combining vowel sounds with the base letters. Example Here is a complete example of sumihiri usage to create various forms of the letter '‡∂ö': k - ‡∂ö‡∑ä, ka/ke - ‡∂ö, kaa - ‡∂ö‡∑è, kz - ‡∂ö‡∑ê, kzz - ‡∂ö‡∑ë, ki - ‡∂ö‡∑í, kii - ‡∂ö‡∑ì, ku - ‡∂ö‡∑î, kuu - ‡∂ö‡∑ñ, kE - ‡∂ö‡∑ô, kee - ‡∂ö‡∑ö, ko - ‡∂ö‡∑ú, koo - ‡∂ö‡∑ù, kai - ‡∂ö‡∑õ, kau - ‡∂ö‡∑û Repaya, Yansaya and Rakaransaya  Example  Rke - ‡∂ª‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ö, kYe - ‡∂ö‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂∫, kRe - ‡∂ö‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª In general, any vowel sound can be associated with any consonant.

On 10 October 2017 it was confirmed that the series would be revived for a second season produced by Caracol Televisi√≥n for Netflix, and it released on 15 March 2019.  Series overview   Plot  The story deals with the lives of five young friends, Brenda, Olivia, Violeta, Renata and Pamela, who live in the fictional Colombian town of \\"El Carmen.\\" Throughout the series, they become further and further embroiled in inextricable situations because of their involvement with drug king-pin, Braulio Bermudez, his family and his lieutenants. Bermudez, played by the veteran Colombian actor, Fernando Sol√≥rzano, is a \\"capo\\" operating out of \\"El Carmen.\\" The five young women all come to sad endings at the end of the story. Pamela immigrates to the United States of America to try to get away from trouble and be near her father, who was a pilot and ended up in prison because he was captured by the DEA taking flying cocaine to the United States. She ends up as a maid but tells Brenda she is happy and having a great life. Olivia ends up in jail for having a fake wedding with the notorious Braulio Bermudez, and acquiring some of his property. Violeta dies when, after Braulio's local cartel breaks into opposing factions, they meet for a final show-down in the ongoing war between them. Renata also dies because, to repay money she owed him, Erick, a former henchman of Braulio, forces her to carry drugs to the United States in her stomach. None of her loved ones ever find out about her death because she has no identification on her person. Brenda ends up carrying Braulio's child, but he is captured, extradited and sent to a US prison, so that she never sees him again. This is a very exciting story to see and it shows how the easy life is never a good choice; it might be nice and easy at the beginning but one day everything ends.

The film is inspired by the popular 1941 song \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" originally recorded by the Glenn Miller Orchestra and featured in the 20th Century Fox film Sun Valley Serenade. The film follows the story of football team owner Bert (George Kennedy) who will inherit one million dollars from a railroad tycoon if he can successfully drive a steam train from New York City to its namesake of Chattanooga, Tennessee in 24 hours. He invites his girlfriend Maggie (Barbara Eden) and his team on the train, who invite their own guests and pick up new ones along the trip. The comedy is derived from numerous delays along the way. The film's promotional tagline is: The song that kept America chuggin' along is this summer's funniest movie! Plot The Chattanooga Choo Choo Railroad has been the entire life of its current owner Alonzo Dillard (Parley Baer), who is celebrating his 75th birthday with his daughter Estelle (Bridget Hanley), his granddaughter Jennie Waters (Melissa Sue Anderson), Jennie's fianc√© Paul Cartwright (Christopher McDonald), and much of the staff of the Chattanooga Choo Choo Railroad including chief porter Woodrow (Davis Roberts). Protagonist Bert Waters (George Kennedy), Estelle's husband and Jennie's father, is late because he's spending time with his \\"girlfriend\\" Maggie Jones (Barbara Eden), whom he plans to marry after divorcing Estelle. Once Bert does arrive, Alonzo refuses to talk to him, having no patience for lateness. Bert is, however, able to introduce Jennie to Mason Foresight (James Horan), Duke of Chalfont; and give Jennie pictures that show Paul asleep next to two attractive twins. Jennie vows not to speak to Paul ever again to Estelle's chagrin and Bert's joy. Alonzo dies shortly afterward and is buried in a Boxcar. By the time his will and testament are read, Jennie has become engaged the Duke. The will leaves $100,000 and a full pension for Woodrow; $5,000,000 for Jennie; and his property and company to Estelle. For Bert, the will sets the condition that he must prove he can be on time by restoring and conducting the Historic Chattanooga Choo Choo locomotive (Sierra Railway 28) and full consist (two heavy 1900s compartment, one diner, and one club Pullman cars) from Pennsylvania Station in New York, to Chattanooga Station, adhering to its historic time table. He must arrive in exactly 24 hours to secure the $1,000,000 Alonzo has left him. On his way to tell Maggie, he runs into a biker gang who make fun of his love for lavender. He has his body guard, Hashimoto (Professor Tanaka), destroy their Harley-Davidson chopper. Bert turns the ride into a boisterous publicity stunt for his new football team, coached by Newt Newton (Joe Namath), which Bert has founded and risked all his capital in, under the assumption he can secure the winning bid for the city's future football stadium over Sam Cartwright (Clu Gulager), Paul's father. The spectacle will end with a grand wedding for Jennie and the Duke at the Railway Museum. The departure doesn't quite go as planned, as Sam and Paul Cartwright have bought tickets to come along, Estelle is left behind in a phone booth which Jennie finds unforgivable, Maggie sneaks onto the train and starts falling for Newt while insisting she knows the Duke from somewhere, and Hashimoto forgets Bert's luggage in the run-in with the Cartwrights. Sam discovers how Bert can be so sure of winning: he has bribed an inside man to remove his bid and bring it along on the train. Norman (John Steadman), the train's Fireman and Pee Wee (Paul Brinegar), the Train's Engineer, discover they're a little rusty, and have trouble communicating on account of Norman having gone half-deaf since they last drove the train, and Pee Wee having gone half-blind. This causes the train to lose 15 minutes off the time table, so Bert instructs Woodrow to order them to skip Philadelphia, an optional stop. Unfortunately, Estelle was hoping to get on at Philadelphia; and Sam, who has recovered his bid, was hoping to get off. Meanwhile, Paul gets the chance to talk to Jennie and she starts to suspect the pictures may be faked. The twins from the picture are on the train, as they are part of the cheer-leading squad of the football team. Football player Jim-Bob (Curtis Taylor, uncredited) pranks Bert with laxative, which makes him toss his pants out the window. With no luggage, he is forced to deliver his whistle-stop press conference in Washington, D.C. station in a skirt. Bert has Hashimoto restrain Sam so he cannot get off and cuts the press conference short, putting them back on schedule. Estelle manages to get on and Bert rushes to hide Maggie in Jim- Bob's compartment so Estelle won't see her. There, Maggie discovers Jim-Bob has drilled a peephole to see into the cheerleaders' compartment. The next morning sees the railroad deliver Bert's luggage using an adapted Ford Model T, but most of it falls, leaving him only with the pants. Maggie shows the peephole to the cheerleaders, and she has an idea to get even. Using her mascara applicator, she spreads super glue on Jim-Bob's side of the hole. Then they intentionally talk loudly so he knows they're there and will start watching, and pretending they don't know about the peephole, Maggie directs them through a striptease. Jim-Bob's eyelid gets glued to the wall, which makes him pull the emergency brake. Maggie also finds where Sam is being kept and tells Paul, who radios for an ultralight plane to land on the train so Sam can deliver his bid in time, and helps convince Hashimoto to let Newt take Sam's place. So the plane can get enough lift, Sam uses Woodrow's radio to order more speed from the locomotive, which eventually puts the train ahead of schedule. Bert goes check on Hashimoto and \\"Sam\\" and, finding Maggie, tells her Newt is \\"just a washed-up ball-player\\" which makes both of them leave him. Estelle walks in on the argument and, spotting Maggie, declares she, too, is leaving Bert. Maggie remembers where she knows the Duke from: he's a con artist from Memphis called Bob Shoemaker. The football team proceeds to force him to confess in front of Jennie and some Trainspotters, which finally makes her and Paul get back together. As everyone celebrates that they're arriving early, the train encounters a road block by the biker gang, who are using Bert's car to demand a replacement Harley. Bert dispatches the football team to disperse them. These antics, however result in their arrival at Chattanooga two minutes late. Bert tries to haggle by setting his watch back, but the executor is absolute: he gets nothing. The large party that was waiting to receive him, leaves. Sam informs him that Bert has lost the bid. The wedding preparations are used to marry Jennie to Paul and Maggie to Newt. It is implied Hashimoto quits after receiving a racial slur and Bert is forced to walk back to the roadblock to retrieve his car, alone; but upon returning with it, one of the cheerleaders takes interest in his car.

Roth B. Schweiz Arch Neurol Neurochir Psychiatr. 1976;119(1):31-4 It has historically been rarely diagnosed and is often very difficult to diagnose at an early stage; it is usually a lifelong chronic disease, which is often debilitating. There is a very low level of public awareness of idiopathic hypersomnia, which often leads to stigma for those who suffer from it. There is currently no cure, but there are several off-label treatments, which are primarily FDA-approved narcolepsy medications. In the medical literature, idiopathic hypersomnia may also be referred to as IH, IHS, primary hypersomnia, central hypersomnia, or hypersomnia of brain origin. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defines idiopathic hypersomnia as EDS without narcolepsy or the associated features of other sleep disorders. It occurs in the absence of medical problems or sleep disruptions, such as sleep apnea, that can cause secondary hypersomnia.  Signs and symptoms  Those who suffer from idiopathic hypersomnia seems to have some common symtoms like Excessive daytime sleepiness, which is characterized by persistent sleepiness throughout the day and often a general lack of energy, even during the day after apparently adequate or even prolonged nighttime sleep. People with EDS are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day; fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep during inappropriate times such as while driving, while at work, during a meal, or in conversations. Sleep inertia (also known as sleep drunkeness), which is characterized by having extreme difficulty waking up and feeling an uncontrollable desire to go back to sleep. Clouding of consciousness (also known as brain fog or mental fog), which is characterized by inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities. This may affect performance on virtually any cognitive task. Cognition includes perception, memory, learning, executive functions, language, constructive abilities, voluntary motor control, attention, and mental speed. Sufferers may complain of forgetfulness, being \\"confused\\", or being \\"unable to think straight\\". Long sleep periods with patients sleeping 9 hours or more over 24-hour periods, yet not feeling refreshed upon waking from nighttime sleep or naps. Daytime naps are generally very long (up to several hours) and are also unrefreshing. Some studies have shown increased frequencies of other symptoms in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, although it is not clear whether these symptoms are caused by the idiopathic hypersomnia. These symptoms include palpitations, digestive problems, difficulty with body temperature regulation, and cognitive problems, especially deficits in memory, attention, and concentration. Anxiety and depression are often increased in idiopathic hypersomnia, most likely as a response to chronic illness. A case series in 2010 found that peripheral vascular symptoms, such as cold hands and feet (Raynaud's-type phenomena) were more common in people with idiopathic hypersomnia than in controls. In addition to difficulty with temperature regulation and Raynaud's type symptoms, other symptoms associated with autonomic dysfunction were noted to occur in idiopathic hypersomnia. These included: fainting episodes (syncope); dizziness upon arising (orthostatic hypotension); and headaches (possibly migrainous in quality). Food cravings and impotence have also been reported. The researchers found that people with IH reported extremely high levels of autonomic dysfunction, on par with other conditions of severe autonomic failure, like MSA (multiple system atrophy) and diabetes.  Causes  Unlike narcolepsy with cataplexy, which has a known cause (autoimmune destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons), the cause of idiopathic hypersomnia has, until recently, been largely unknown, hence its name. However, researchers have identified a few abnormalities associated with IH, which with further study may help to clarify the etiology. Destruction of noradrenergic neurons has produced hypersomnia in experimental animal studies, and injury to adrenergic neurons has also been shown to lead to hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia has also been associated with a malfunction of the norepinephrine system and decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) histamine levels. Researchers have recently found an abnormal hypersensitivity to GABA (the major brain chemical responsible for sedation) in a subset of patients with central hypersomnia i.e.: idiopathic hypersomnia, narcolepsy without cataplexy and long sleepers. They have identified a small (500 to 3000 daltons) naturally occurring bioactive substance (most likely a peptide as it is trypsin-sensitive) in the CSF of afflicted patients. Although this substance requires further identification of its chemical structure, it is currently referred to as a \\"somnogen\\" because it has been shown to cause hyper-reactivity of GABAA receptors, which leads to increased sedation or somnolence. In essence, it is as though these patients are chronically sedated with a benzodiazepine (medication which acts through the GABA system) such as Versed or Xanax, even though they do not take these medications.  Diagnosis  People with idiopathic hypersomnia often live without a correct diagnosis for a long time, blaming themselves and struggling to maintain work, studies, and relationships. Idiopathic hypersomnia has historically been difficult to diagnose at an early stage, especially due to low awareness and therefore, at the time of presentation, most patients have had the disorder for many years. Further complicating the diagnostic process, idiopathic hypersomnia lacks a clearly defining biological marker like HLA-DQB1*0602 genotype in narcolepsy. Doctors can more carefully exclude these causes of EDS in order to more correctly diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia. However, \\"even in the presence of other specific causes of hypersomnia, one should carefully assess the contribution of these etiological factors to the complaint of EDS and when specific treatments of these conditions fail to suppress EDS, the additional diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia should be considered.\\" The severity of EDS can be quantified by subjective scales, such as the Epworth sleepiness scale and the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS), and also by objective tests, like actigraphy, maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) although as per latest research studies, the effectiness of MSLT has been called into question.\\" Several groups of researchers have found normal MSLT results in patients who otherwise seem to have idiopathic hypersomnia. Therefore, when idiopathic hypersomnia is suspected, researchers suggest appending a 24-hour continuous polysomnography to the standard overnight/MSLT study in order to record total sleep time. It is also important to note that whereas narcolepsy is strongly associated with the HLA-DQB1*0602 genotype, \\"HLA typing is of no help in the positive diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia.\\" This is \\"despite some reports that suggest an increase [sic] frequency of HLA Cw2 and DRS in idiopathic hypersomnia subjects.\\" In patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, polysomnography typically shows short sleep latency, increased mean slow wave sleep, and a high mean sleep efficiency. \\"Latency to REM sleep and percentages of light sleep and REM sleep were normal, compared with normal ranges.\\" Despite this, one study has found increased sleep fragmentation in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time, suggesting multiple possible presentations. As per ICSD-3, six criteria must be met for a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. First is daytime lapses into sleep or an irrepressible need to sleep on a daily basis, for at least 3 months, second is absence of insufficient sleep syndrome, third is absence of cataplexy, fourth is absence of other causes of hypersomnia and fifth and sixth is presence of positive MSLT tests. The latest ICD 10 defines Idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time as a neurological disorder that is a rare sleep disorder characterized by prolonged sleep at night and extreme sleepiness during the day. There are no apparent causes. This disorder affects the ability to function. It is of central nervous system origin characterized by prolonged nocturnal sleep and periods of daytime drowsiness. Affected individuals experience difficulty with awakening in the morning and may have associated sleep drunkenness, automatic behaviors, and memory disturbances. This condition differs from narcolepsy in that daytime sleep periods are longer, there is no association with cataplexy, and the multiple sleep latency onset test does not record sleep-onset rapid eye movement sleep.  Management  Since the underlying disease mechanism is not yet fully understood, treatment efforts have usually focused on symptom management. There are no FDA-approved medicines for idiopathic hypersomnia. The wake-promoting medications used in narcolepsy are also commonly used off-label to help manage the excessive daytime sleepiness of idiopathic hypersomnia. However, the medications currently used for idiopathic hypersomnia are far from satisfactory. CNS stimulants tend to be less effective for idiopathic hypersomnia than they are for narcolepsy and may be less well tolerated. Different medications could be administered in combination to address different symptoms like it is found that methylphenidate is effective in addressesing EDS while pemoline is more effective in addressing brain fog. Further, different medicines are known to augment the activity of one another like as seen in the case of Fluoxetine which augmented the activity of methylphenidate when taken together. In addition to medications, \\"behavioral approaches and sleep hygiene techniques are recommended, although they have little overall positive impact on this disease.\\" \\"Planned naps are unhelpful, as they are both long and unrefreshing.\\" Although behavioral approaches have not been shown to improve EDS, the goal, as in CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), is often to help patients learn to reduce their negative emotional responses (e.g. frustration, anger, depression) to their disease symptoms. Furthermore, because idiopathic hypersomnia \\"may lead to marriage breakdown, extensive counseling for the patient's partners, educating them about the symptomatology and treatment options, must be part of a comprehensive management plan. Education of relatives, friends, and colleagues helps the patient to function much better with this incurable disease.\\"  Stimulants  The main treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness is done through central nervous system stimulants. Methylphenidate and Dextroamphetamine are most used stimulants to controlled EDS. Increased dopamine release is felt to be the main property explaining wake-promotion from these medications. Insomnia is another common side effect and may require additional treatment. Mazindol is a stimulant similar to amphetamines that \\"has been shown to be effective in treating hypersomnia in narcoleptics.\\" However, it is not currently approved in the US. Caffeine is one of the safer nondopaminergic wake-promoting compounds. It is widely used but \\"has intolerable side effects at high doses (including cardiovascular), and it is generally not efficient enough for patients with hypersomnia or narcolepsy.\\"  Non-stimulant wake-promoting medications  Modafinil and Armodafinil elevate hypothalamic histamine levels, and they are known to bind to the dopamine transporter, thereby inhibiting dopamine reuptake. Modafinil can cause uncomfortable side effects, including nausea, headache, and a dry mouth for some patients, while other patients report no noticeable improvement even on relatively high dosages. They may also \\"interact with low-dose contraceptives, potentially reducing efficacy, although the scientific data supporting this claim is weak and rests on poorly documented anecdotes.\\" Solriamfetol is the first and only dual- acting dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved by the FDA to improve wakefulness in adults living with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. Atomoxetine (or reboxetine in Europe) is an adrenergic reuptake inhibitor which increases wakefulness (generally less strongly than the medications which act on dopamine) and which has been argued to have a \\"clear use in the therapeutic arsenal against narcolepsy and hypersomnia although undocumented by clinical trials.\\" Ritanserin is a serotonin antagonist that has \\"been shown to improve daytime alertness and subjective sleep quality in patients on their usual narcolepsy medications.\\" It is intended as an adjunct (supplement to another main therapeutic agent), and although it is not available in the US, it is available in Europe. Pitolisant, a selective histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, was approved by FDA during August 2019. It works by increasing the synthesis and release of histamine, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter in the brain. Selegiline, monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor works by slowing the breakdown of certain substances in the brain (mostly dopamine, but also serotonin and norepinephrine). It may also be useful, as it is also a metabolic precursor of amphetamine and exerts most of its therapeutic effects through amphetamine metabolism. It is not commonly prescribed for people with narcolepsy because of the high dosage required and potential for severe side effects.  Sleep promoting medications  Sodium oxybate is an orphan drug which was designed specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and hallucinations. A 2016 study by Leu-Semenescu et al. found sodium oxybate improved daytime sleepiness in idiopathic hypersomnia to the same degree as in patients with narcolepsy type 1, and the drug improved severe sleep inertia in 71% of the hypersomnia patients. FDA approved Xywav‚Ñ¢ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution on July 2020 for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. Melatonin is a hormone that the body produces to help regulate sleep. One small study, which used a dose of 2 mg slow-release melatonin at bedtime, found that 50% of participants had ‚Äúshortened nocturnal sleep duration, decreased sleep drunkenness and relieved daytime sleepiness.‚Äù Other studies have shown that melatonin synchronizes the circadian rhythms, and improves the ‚Äúonset, duration and quality of sleep.‚Äù  Antidepressants  Antidepressants seems to have some therapeutic effects as they enhance synaptic levels of noradrenaline and serotonin. Bupropion, a norepinephrine- dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), which works by inhibiting the reabsorption of two important brain chemicals ‚Äì norepinephrine and dopamine, is known to have wake-promoting effects. Fluoxetine, an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class is also known to have mild stimulating effects. It is also known to augment the activity of methylphenidate.  GABA-directed medications  Given the possible role of hyperactive GABAA receptors in idiopathic hypersomnia, medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness. These currently include clarithromycin and flumazenil. Flumazenil, a GABAA receptor antagonist is approved by the FDA for use in anesthesia reversal and benzodiazepine overdose. Research has shown that flumazenil provides relief for most patients whose CSF contains the unknown \\"somnogen\\" that enhances the function of GABAA receptors, making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of GABA. For one patient, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years. A 2014 case report also showed improvement in idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms after treatment with a continuous subcutaneous flumazenil infusion. Clarithromycin, an antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of infections, was found to return the function of the GABA system to normal in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. In the pilot study, clarithromycin improved subjective sleepiness in GABA-related hypersomnia. In 2013, a retrospective review evaluating longer-term clarithromycin use showed efficacy in a large percentage of patients with GABA-related hypersomnia.  Dietary supplements  Carnitine, has also been shown to improve narcolepsy symptoms (including daytime sleepiness) by increasing fatty-acid oxidation. Abnormally low levels of acylcarnitine have been observed in patients with narcolepsy. These same low levels have been associated with primary hypersomnia in general in mouse studies. \\"Mice with systemic carnitine deficiency exhibit a higher frequency of fragmented wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced locomotor activity.\\" Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine was shown to improve these symptoms in mice. A subsequent human trial found that narcolepsy patients given L-carnitine spent less total time in daytime sleep than patients who were given placebo.  Prognosis  Idiopathic hypersomnia is a lifelong disorder (with only rare spontaneous remissions) whose symptoms typically begin in adolescence or young adulthood. It is initially progressive, but may stabilize, and its main consequences are professional and social. The disorder is chronic, and the symptoms can be relentless. If an effective medication to control symptoms cannot be found, it can be extremely difficult for people with IH to hold down jobs, remain in school, maintain marriages, and fully engage with their family and friends. Even with medication, patients may struggle with these activities. Many patients are chronically tardy to work, school or social engagements and, over time, may lose the ability to function in family, social, occupational or other settings altogether. Idiopathic hypersomnia profoundly affects work, education, and quality of life. Patients often need to drastically adapt their lifestyle after diagnosis. Avoiding situations that might be dangerous while sleepy, such as driving. It is not safe to drive a car unless the symptoms are under control with medication. Patients are often too sleepy to work or attend school regularly, and they are predisposed \\"to develop serious performance decrements in multiple areas of function as well as to potentially life- threatening domestic, work-related and driving accidents.\\" Furthermore, these risks are higher for idiopathic hypersomnia patients than for those with sleep apnea or severe insomnia. In fact, \\"the most severe cases of daytime somnolence are found in patients affected by narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.\\" Surprisingly, excessive daytime sleepiness is even more handicapping than the cataplectic attacks of narcolepsy. Due to the consequences of their profound EDS, both idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy can often result in unemployment. Several studies have shown a high rate of unemployment in narcoleptics (from 30‚Äì59%), which was felt to be related to the severe symptoms of their illness.  Epidemiology  Typically, the symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia begin in adolescence or young adulthood, although they can begin at a later age. After onset, hypersomnia often worsens over several years, but it is often stable by the time of diagnosis and appears to be a lifelong condition. Spontaneous remission is only seen in 10‚Äì15% of patients. According to the limited epidemiological data that exists, IH \\"has more of a female preponderance (1.8/1).\\" Family cases are frequent, in a range from 25% to 66% without any clear mode of inheritance.\\" Idiopathic hypersomnia has long been considered a rare disease, believed to be 10 times less frequent than narcolepsy. The prevalence of narcolepsy (with cataplexy) is estimated between 1/3,300 and 1/5,000. Although the true prevalence of idiopathic hypersomnia is unknown, it is estimated at 1/10,000 ‚Äì 1/25,000 for the long sleep form and 1/11,000 to 1/100,000 without long sleep. A more precise estimate \\"is complicated by a lack of clear biologic markers\\" and a lack of \\"unambiguous diagnostic criteria.\\" Because idiopathic hypersomnia has been considered a rare disease, it has not received enough attention from authorities and researchers. \\"Patients are rare, researchers and scientists involved in the field are few and research findings are therefore scarce.\\" \\"In Europe and in North America there is now a public health concern about helping patients and families affected by these rare diseases. Due to the complexity of the disease, they often experience difficulties to be diagnosed and often face social and professional consequences.\\" (see Prognosis)  Society and culture  Idiopathic hypersomnia is a rarity in the public eye and has a very low level of public awareness. Because of this low awareness, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia often need significant support because they are at risk of being isolated and misunderstood. Therefore, the education of relatives, friends, and colleagues helps the patient to function much better with this incurable disease.  Research   Gamma aminobutyric acid A antagonist  There is ongoing research into the efficacy of gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor antagonists for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03542851?cond=Idiopathic+Hypersomnia&rank;=2 Research findings suggest that the GABA neurotransmitter system plays a significant role in the etiology of primary hypersomnias, such as IH and Narcolepsy Type 2.  Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)  Dr. Ferini-Strambi and his colleagues in Milan, Italy, performed neurologic examinations by applying anodal tDCS by placing one electrode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with the cathode over the contralateral orbit over 3 weeks period and found that seven of the eight participants (87.5%) reported improvement in their daytime sleepiness, including for up to two weeks after the end of the study.  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  Neural networks that regulate arousal and sleep comprise a bottom-up (from the brainstem to the cortex) pathway and a top-down (corticothalamic) pathway. The bottom-up pathway emerges from the ascending reticular arousal system (ARAS) and activates the cortex via well-characterized thalamic and nonthalamic pathways through cholinergic and aminergic neurotransmission. The bottom-up pathway represents the leverage point for pharmaceutical interventions. It is complemented by a corticothalamic top-down pathway, which appears to be modifiable through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques. A single case report study indicates that high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) might represent an alternative choice for symptom control in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy. rTMS may also exert intrinsic effects on hypersomnia in depressed adolescents.  Levothyroxine  There have been some studies suggesting levothyroxine as a possible treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia, especially for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.H. Shinno et al. (June 2011). \\"Effect of levothyroxine on prolonged nocturnal sleep time and excessive daytime somnolence in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia.\\" Sleep Medicine Vol. 12 6: 578‚Äì583 This treatment does carry potential risks (especially for patients without hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothroidism), which include cardiac arrhythmia.  Hypocretin agonists  Hypocretin-1 has been shown to be strongly wake-promoting in animal models, but it does not cross the blood- brain barrier. Suvorexant, a hypocretin receptor antagonist, has been developed to limit the natural effects of hypocretin in patients with insomnia. It is therefore possible that a hypocretin agonist may be similarly developed for the treatment of hypersomnia.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  Antidepressants seems to have some therapeutic effects as they enhance synaptic levels of noradrenaline and serotonin and for same reason enhancing the levels of acetylcholine may have some therapeutic effect. Donepezil showed improvement in one patient by decreasing ESS score from 20 up to 14. Memantine has also shown some positive effect on a patient suffering from narcolepsy.  Levodopa  Levodopa is an amino acid and is the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). As per a study of six narcoleptic patients it was found that L-dopa improved vigilance and performance as evaluated by the AVS and the FCRTT, while the capacity to fall asleep rapidly remained unchanged as evaluated by the MSLT. It raises the hypothesis that dopamine may play a role in the physiopathology of excessive daytime sleepiness of this condition.

Originally named Willow Springs, the town was envisioned to be one of the biggest cities of Southern Oregon. Tolo was platted in 1888, but was virtually abandoned by the year 1918. In 1986, the Jackson County Commission returned the plat to public ownership.  History  Prior to the arrival of settlers in mid-19th century, Shasta, Takelma, Latgawa, and Athabaskan Indians lived in the Rogue River valley. Early Hudson's Bay Company hunters and trappers, following the Siskiyou Trail, passed through the area in the 1820s. In the late 1840s, settlers (mostly American) following the Applegate Trail began passing through the area. By the early 1850s, the Donation Land Act brought many white settlers into the Rogue Valley and in conflict with its Native people. These often violent clashes prompted the signing of the Table Rock Treaty on September 10, 1853.  Table Rock Treaty and Fort Lane  The Table Rock Treaty established the first reservation in the Pacific Northwest, the Table Rock Indian Reservation, which encompassed Upper and Lower Table Rock, Sams Valley, and the Evans Creek and Sardine Creek watersheds.http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/coucil_of_table_rock/ The treaty also called for a fort to protect the Indians from the ambitions of the white settlers. Fort Lane was constructed in 1853 in what was to become Willow Springs, and later, Tolo. It was occupied by two companies of the U.S. Army's 1st Dragoons under the command of Captain Andrew Jackson Smith. The fort was used to maintain the peace between the pioneers and native peoples. However, tensions and violence continued to mount, leading to the Rogue River Wars of 1855-1856. Joel Palmer, Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, ordered the removal of the Indians of southwest Oregon to the Coastal Indian Reservation of northern Oregon. Fort Lane became the Army headquarters for the removal.  Growth of the community  After the removal of the Indians, Willow Springs continued to grow. The Willow Springs post office was opened in 1864. Mines, quarries, and mills sprang up in the area. In 1871, the Department of the Interior relinquished Fort Lane, which was subsequently purchased by investors. In 1886, the name Willow Springs was officially changed to Tolo. Popular belief is that the intended name was to be Yolo in tribute to Yolo County, California, but that the postal authorities misread the \\"Y\\", mistaking it for a \\"T\\", thus naming the Post Office \\"Tolo\\". Examination of the 1886 application to the Post Office Department reveals, however, that the first name selected was \\"Table Rock,\\" apparently rejected because at the time two-word names for new post offices were not being accepted. \\"Table Rock\\" was then crossed off on the 1886 form and replaced with a very clearly written \\"Tolo.\\" Tolo is a word from the Chinook Jargon, and means a \\"windfall\\" or \\"payday\\", possibly reinforcing the hopes of its founders that Tolo would become one of the larger cities in Southern Oregon, with prosperity for all. In 1888, Tolo was platted by lawyer and former Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice Paine Page Prim. Tolo began to dwindle around the turn of the 20th century. Tolo post office closed in 1897. Around that time, two brothers from New York, Colonel Frank H. Ray, and Doctor Charles R. Ray began developments in Tolo. The post office re-opened in 1898. The Ray brothers opened a rock quarry, which led to Tolo's nickname of \\"Construction City\\". From 1902 to 1904, the Ray brothers constructed the Gold Ray Dam, the first hydro-electric plant in Southern Oregon, bringing electricity to the region. Demise By 1915, it appeared that Tolo was not going to become the large city envisioned by its founders. The population remained at 150, and the momentum for growth was lacking, despite the city having a brick plant, quarry, sawmill, and gold mines. In 1918, the post office closed permanently, along with the railroad depot. In 1986, the Jackson County Commission returned the plat, which contained 474 building lots, along with public streets, to public ownership. Future The Tolo area is designated by Jackson County Commissioners for future industrial development, along with the Medford Industrial Park in White City.

The house was built in 1897, and is a fine local example of a Queen Anne Victorian with some Colonial Revival styling. It is also notable as the home of naturalist and taxidermist Charles Johnson Maynard. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Maynard House is located on the north side of Crafts Street, a historic thoroughfare connecting Waltham and Newton Corner. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with asymmetrical massing and a complex roofline typical of the Queen Anne period. The walls are finished in wooden clapboards, and the building rests on a fieldstone foundation. The hip roof is pierced by a number of gabled dormers, and there is an octagonal tower with pyramidal roof at one corner. The front porch has a flat roof, and is supported by Tuscan columns with a simple balustrade. The house was built in 1897, and is a fairly typical of the suburban residential construction taking place in Newton at that time. The house was built on part of what was once the Maynard family farm, subdivided from property owned by Charles Johnson Maynard's brother. Charles Johnson Maynard was a prominent naturalist and taxidermist who worked and lived in Boston for many years, but returned to Newton in 1897, and remained in this house until his death in 1929. Maynard was a prominent local lecturer, and published at least eleven books on bird-related topics.

The district includes all of Curve Street, where the Myrtle Baptist Church is located, as well as a few properties on adjacent Auburn and Prospect Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history Curve Street, and adjacent areas that were razed to make way for the adjacent Massachusetts Turnpike, has been a center of Newton's African-American community since about 1870, and is the only such area to retain any sort of historic integrity in the city. The focus of the neighborhood became the Myrtle Baptist Church, a wood frame structure built in 1875 and rebuilt in 1898 after a fire, and nearby railroad yards provided a source of jobs for laborers who lived in the neighborhood. Houses along densely packed Curve Street have in some cases remained in the ownership of the same families since the area was first settled. The district contains one church, one commercial building, and twenty-two residential houses. Most of the houses were built between the 1880s and 1929, and are set on small relatively near the street. Most are single-family residences, although there is one large Second Empire house that has been converted to condominiums, and there are a few duplexes and one triple-decker. Stylistically they are diverse, typically done in vernacular versions of popular revival styles of the period. The most unusual house in the district is 15-29 Prospect Street, the converted Second Empire house, which was moved into the area sometime in the 19th century, and had been divided into apartments by the early 20th century. It retains many of its original architectural features, including a bracketed cornice, segmented-arch dormers in the mansard roof, and an elaborate cupola.

It extends along West Main Street from Mechanic Street to Gibbon Street, along Pleasant Street from West Main to Lincoln Street, and also includes short pieces of Witherbee and Winthrop Streets abutting West Main. Most of the buildings in the district are houses built between 1820 and 1930, the period of the city's growth as an industrial center. The district includes 77 properties, all but two of which contribute to its historic significance. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The city of Marlborough developed as a small industrial city during the 19th century, with industry, business, and commerce focused in its downtown area. To the west of the downtown a residential area developed that followed a typical pattern for industrializing cities. The upper-class owners, managers, and merchants built high-quality housing on well-proportioned lots on major streets near the centers of commerce and industry, while lower-class workers and functionaries lived in more modest and densely packed areas. In Marlborough West Main Street and Pleasant Street were two major roads along which the finer houses were built, set back on lots with manicured lawns. Typical examples in this district include the Italianate Brigham-Cutting House (c. 1876-77)at 22 Pleasant Street, the Greek Revival William Pitt Brigham House (c. 1858) at 28 Pleasant Street, and the Queen Anne Stevens House (c. 1885) at 32 Pleasant. The latter two houses were both owned around the turn of the 20th century by factory owners. The houses along Witherbee and Winthrop Street are in slightly smaller lots. Larger houses in this area were built and occupied by skilled workers, and many of them have since been subdivided into multiple units. Typical examples include the Second Empire George A. Howe House (c. 1870) at 59 Witherbee Street, the Bungalow-style Kelley House (c. 1915) at 17 Winthrop Street, and the Georgian Revival Ellis House (c. 1920) at 14 Winthrop. There are two major non-residential buildings in the district. The Christian Science Church (corner of West Main and Winthrop) is a residential-scale structure built in 1920, while the St. Mary's Credit Union Building (135 West Main) is an ahistoric oversized Colonial Revival structure that does not contribute to the area's historic significance.

These activities are generally performed in line with a company strategy and/or a project. Effective effort management requires self-discipline, communication, motivation, energy and focus. As part of the effort management process, effective scheduling and recording of the performed activities is essential. Depending on the results of the activity, adjustments can be made to further benefit the project and / or company. These adjustments will generally be made in the areas of quantity, quality and direction. The main goal of effort management within organizations is to increase viable and beneficial opportunities for the company.  Applications  Effort management is useful for processes and strategies that seek to focus on activities instead of other areas like project management especially if new activities are integrated into the process. For example, in software development, effort management breaks activities down to appropriate granularity level so that it leads to manageable activity sets. If used in the management of supply chain, it can be deployed in the planning, implementation, and regulation of functions related to supply chain in order to induce value creation. In the academic field, effort management is used to improve the educational achievement of learners. A study revealed that it facilitates motivational regulation strategies and is directly linked to the improvement of students' GPA. The effort management framework could also positively affect sales for a retail organization. With the Bayesian approach, a strategy that employs effort management can determine demand not only based on sales but also based on stocks (for the probability of an exact demand observation) and the employees' sales effort.

A formal note to open negotiation was sent to the Chinese Foreign Minister in Peking on October 27, 1920. The Bolsheviks sent M.I. Yurin, Alexander Paikes and Adolph Joffe. Signing Adolph Joffe would not settle the question of Outer Mongolia or the Chinese Far Eastern Railway. But he was successful in establishing a political relations with Sun Yat-sen. On January 26, 1923 Sun and Joffe issued the manifesto. It became the foundation of cooperation between the Kuomintang and Soviet Union.

The geometric stained- glass windows were designed by William Jay Bolton. The church faces Chelsea Park across 9th Avenue. The building is a New York City landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1858 the congregation needed to expand, so architect Charles Babcock of the firm of Richard Upjohn & Son enlarged the building into a cross-shaped sanctuary with the addition of transepts. The church, the only one that Lafever designed which remains extant in Manhattan, is also one of the very few there of Italianate design, although the church has also been described as an early example of Romanesque Revival architecture., pp. 188-189 The vestry is in \\"pure Tuscan\\" style.Hamlin, Talbot. \\"The Rise of Eclecticism in New York\\", Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 11, No. 2 (May, 1952), pp. 3-8 Lafever's sanctuary was a three-aisled basilica. The ceiling was vaulted with plaster groins \\"small in scale but beautiful in proportion.\\" Original Lafever touches in the details include the corbels from which the ribs spring. The church's congregation has always been a socially active one. It is rumored that the church was a stop on the Underground Railroad during the American Civil War. In the 1970s, the church was instrumental in the foundation of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, a synagogue for gays and lesbians begun by Jacob Gubbay. It hosted the congregation from 1973 to 1975, and again from December 1998 until it found a permanent home in April 2016. In that same decade, Holy Apostles hosted the ordination of the first woman priest (and openly lesbian) in the New York diocese, Rev. Ellen Barrett. In 1982, the congregation began the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, which continues to serve the indigent of the area. The Church of the Holy Apostles is located in Penn South, a housing cooperative. During the construction of Penn South in 1959, builders considered demolishing the church to make way for Penn South. Ultimately, four churches on the site, including the Church of the Holy Apostles, were saved. The UHF's president, Abraham Kazan, later called the preservation a \\"mistake\\" because it had prevented Penn South from being developed earlier. The sanctuary was badly damaged in 1990 by a fire, in which some of the stained-glass windows were lost, but most survived without serious damage.

Organizations such as the Society for Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE), the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have established standards for the proper transmission and display of video signals. Commercially available televisions do not generally conform to those standards, but often possess controls that allow those with the proper training and equipment to greatly improve the quality of image reproduction. The Imaging Science Foundation (ISF) has promoted the value of good video reproduction and certifies candidates as ISF-trained calibrators in the techniques necessary to bring video displays in line with established broadcast, DVD, and Blu-ray standards. ISF calibrators rely upon three tools to accomplish this goal: * Color analyzer: hardware that connects to a computer that measures the light and color produced by the display device. * Test patterns: standard video test patterns that test the display‚Äôs ability to perform as expected. * Video calibration software: software that receives the signals from the color analyzer and displays the data in numerical format which is interpreted in a human interface in the form of real-time charts and graphs. Calibrators use this information to guide decisions about how to properly adjust the displays. Though the ISF popularized the value of professional video calibration, in recent years the equipment necessary to carry out the necessary tasks has become inexpensive enough that enthusiasts and prosumers have been empowered to calibrate their own displays. There are three products that are currently available in a price range that consumers can afford. * Color HCFR * ChromaPure * CalMan Color HCFR is a freeware program developed by enthusiasts in France. It was released in 2006. ChromaPure is a commercial product that was released in 2009. It was developed by a partnership between an American ISF calibrator and a programmer. CalMAN is a commercial product that was originally released as a Microsoft Excel-based program in 2002. In 2007 it was redesigned as a standalone Windows program based around a new Calibration Optimization and Reporting Environment (CORE) engine. Written exclusively using 64-bit double-precision floating point math, the CORE engine outperforms even popular spreadsheet applications for calculation accuracy because it never has to drop to single-precision or integer operations for convenience or speed purposes. It was developed by a partnership between an American video engineer and a programmer with a goal to make video calibration increasingly accessible and more powerful. All video calibration software interfaces with a color analyzer that reads the luminance and the color from a commercial display.

The church is a New York City landmark, designated in 1966,, p.77 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is located within New York City's Ladies' Mile Historic District. History The Gothic Revival church building was constructed in 1844‚Äì1845 according to a design by Richard Upjohn, and was consecrated in 1846. pp.88‚Äì89 In 1853 Upjohn completed the Parish House and Rectory on West 20th Street, and in 1854 he built the Sister's House. The design of the church, which features brownstone blocks chosen for placement at random, made the church \\"one of the most influential buildings of the 19th century\\". It was: 1876 > [the] first asymmetrical Gothic Revival church edifice in the United States > ... Upjohn designed the building to resemble a small medieval English parish > church ... The church's founder, the Reverend William Muhlenberg, a leader > of the evangelical Catholic within the Episcopal Church, was closely > involved with the design ... Muhlenberg believed that the Gothic style was \\"the true architectural expression of Christianity.\\" At the time it was built, the neighborhood around the church was still a fashionable residential area, with homes lining Sixth Avenue. By the late 19th century, as the city continued to expand uptown, the area had become part of the \\"Ladies' Mile\\" shopping district, with Sixth Avenue lined with giant department stores and dry goods emporia, which by World War I had all either moved uptown or closed. In 1975 the declining parish merged with those of Calvary Church, on Park Avenue South at East 21st Street, and St. George's Church, at Stuyvesant Square, and the combined parish of Calvary-St. George's the Church of the Holy Communion granted a ninety-nine year lease to the Lindisfarne Association. The building became the Lindisfarne Association's headquarters from 1976 to 1979. Through the work of its founder William Irwin Thompson and start-up grants from the Lilly Endowment and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the church became a cultural center in which Gary Snyder, Robert Bly, Wendell Berry, Samuel Menash, and Kathleen Raine gave poetry readings, Paul Winter and David Hykes gave concerts, Jerzy Grotowksi and Andre Gregory lectured on theatre, and philosophers such as Gregory Bateson, Francisco Varela, and Thompson himself gave the lectures that became their subsequent books. Keith Critchlow and John Michel taught courses on sacred architecture, and representatives of world religions such as Nechung Rinpoche, Seyed Hosein Nasr, and Pir Vilayat Khan gave public presentations. The Lindisfarne Association, however, was unable to raise the funds to restore this historical landmark, consequently, Lindisfarne moved to Crestone, Colorado, and returned the church to the Episcopal parish. The parish subsequently sold the building to Odyssey House, a drug rehabilitation program, in order to meet its fiscal obligations.Calvary St, George website (Accessed:May 19, 2010) Odyssey House, in turn, sold the buildings to nightclub entrepreneur Peter Gatien, who opened the New York Limelight club there in 1983. Later uses From 1983 until 2007, the church was utilized as a nightclub, The Limelight. After frequent problems with the police and charges of rampant drug abuse in the club, it was closed, but reopened in 2003 under the name \\"Avalon\\". It closed permanently in 2007. On May 7, 2010, the building was reopened as a retail mall called the Limelight Marketplace. Conceived by Jack Menashe, who formerly owned SoHo retail store Lounge, James Mansour of Mansour Design, and Melisca Klisanin, Creative Director, the marketplace is a three-story venue consisting of more than 60 small, high-end shops, selling jewelry, clothing, organic goods and other items.Johnson, Richard et al.\\"The Limelight is Going Retail\\" New York Post (June 17, 2009) It was promoted with a campaign which utilized advertisements on local buses, taxicabs, and billboards.

The church building was constructed in 1850-55 and was designed by architect Richard Upjohn in English Gothic Revival style. It was built as one of several uptown chapels of the Trinity Church parish, but was sold to the Serbian Eastern Orthodox parish in 1942, re-opening as the Cathedral of St. Sava in 1944. The church complex includes the Trinity Chapel School, now the cathedral's Parish House, which was built in 1860 and was designed by Jacob Wrey Mould, a polychromatic Victorian Gothic building which is Mould's only extant structure in New York City. Attached to the sanctuary itself is the Clergy House at 26 West 26th Street, which was built in 1866 and was designed by Richard Upjohn and his son Richard M. Upjohn. p.199 The chapel was designated a New York City landmark in 1968, and the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Most of the church was destroyed in a four-alarm fire on May 1, 2016. In June 2016 reports were circulating that the city of New York ordered that the remains of the structure be demolished, stating that the walls are too unstable to be allowed to stand. The Buildings Department quickly clarified that the inspection was not complete and they had not ordered the immediate demolition of the building and instead is working with the parish to stabilize the structure.  Architecture  The entrance to the cathedral (2011) The outside is made of heavy exterior blocks of the building were etched in a rough finish, accented with austere Gothic trim and details. The front fa√ßade sits on West 25th Street and faces south. It measures around in width by roughly in height. The fa√ßade is supported by four stone buttresses, framed by delicate stone turrets at the sides, and punctuated by a large rose window above the entrance. Prior to the fire that took place May 1, 2016, the church was known to have had one of the largest timber hammerbeam roofs in the City of New York. History Trinity Chapel With the population of New York City moving ever- northward up Manhattan island in the mid-19th century, Trinity Church, the center of Episcopalianism in the city, needed to provide for its uptown parishioners, especially in the increasingly sought-after residential neighborhoods around Union and Madison Squares. p.80 The church's solution was to build a chapel, named Trinity Chapel, on West 25th Street just off of Madison Square as an uptown annex., p.244 The architect selected was Richard Upjohn, who designed the third and current version of Trinity Church, as well as the Church of the Ascension on Fifth Avenue and West 10th Street, as well as many other churches in the Gothic Revival mode in the northeast. The parish was a wealthy and influential one, and Trinity was the only one of Trinity Church's chapels which was capable of supporting itself without assistance from the home church. In 1865 in Trinity Episcopal Church the Orthodox Liturgy was held for the first time in American history. Among the congregants was writer Edith Wharton, who was married in the church in 1885. In 1892, the reredos and altar were redesigned by Frederick Clarke Withers. Cathedral of St. Sava Bust of Nikola Tesla outside the cathedral By 1930, as the rich and influential continued their uptown migration, the neighborhood around Madison Square had seriously declined. The chapel was now located within the Tenderloin, the city's main entertainment and red light district, and the congregation had dwindled. A Serbian Orthodox congregation, founded in the 1930s, purchased the building in 1942, with assistance from various Serbian churches, and the building re-opened in 1944 as a Serbian Orthodox cathedral dedicated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of the Serbs. The first pastor was Rev. Dushan Shoulkletovich. Peter II, the last king of Yugoslavia attended services here. Gradual changes were made to the sanctuary to make it more Eastern Orthodox in style. A hand-carved oak iconostasis was added in 1962. The Byzantine, hand-carved Iconostasis, brought from the Monastery of St. Naum in Ohrid, Yugoslavia, was placed in the cathedral and blessed. The Icons on the Iconostasis were written by Russian iconographer, Ivan Meljinkov. When a bomb went off near the church on September 4, 1966 destroying some of the stained-glass windows, they were replaced with new ones commissioned in Byzantine style. Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle visited St. Sava Cathedral in October 1992. This was the first time the New York Church community was visited by a Patriarch. Outside the church are busts of Bishop Nikolai Velimirovich, who was instrumental in founding the parish, helped to organize the Serbian Orthodox Church in America, and was in later years the \\"luminary- in-residence\\" at the cathedral; Nikola Tesla, the inventor and entrepreneur; and Michael Pupin, a physicist of Serbian heritage. Prior to the fire of May 1, 2016 around $4 million had been spent on renovations to the cathedral's roof, gutters, and its attached community center in the past decade. The church's ceiling was repainted during those renovations to depict a nighttime sky. 2016 fire The cathedral after the fire. (Photo: May 3, 2016)On May 1, 2016, a massive fire occurred at the church, on the day Orthodox Christians were celebrating Easter, destroying most of the building. The four-alarm fire started at 6:49 p.m. local time and was brought under control by 8:30 p.m. employing more than 170 firefighters overall. There was one minor injury. The stone walls of the cathedral remain standing, and have been deemed to be structurally sound and not currently in danger of collapsing. Church officials have indicated they will examine whether any part of the structure could be preserved. The parish house associated with the Chapel Complex was not harmed by fire.  Aftermath  The cathedral in 2017 St. Sava parishioners reunited a few blocks away the first Sunday after the fire at Gramercy Park's Episcopal Calvary-St. George's Parish Church to worship. Church officials indicate there will be plans to rebuild at the current site. Offers of support, including a letter from Patriarch Bartholomew, have been shared with the parishioners of the church. Serbia's Foreign Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá indicated that the City of New York would be asked through diplomatic channels to aid in the rebuilding of the church. He also indicated Prime Minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá authorized him to say that the government will help rebuild the church, \\"because it has great significance for the Serbian community and the Serbian spirit in New York.\\" As of two days after the fire, the definitive cause of the fire had not been determined. Candles that had not been properly extinguished after an Easter service were identified as a likely cause, according to a spokesperson of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). A caretaker told fire marshals that he stowed the candles in a cardboard box under a piece of wooden furniture in a rear corner of the 161-year-old church. Nearly a month after the fire FDNY spokesman Frank Gribbon indicated conclusively that, \\"Fire marshals have ... determined that candles, which had not been completely extinguished, caused the fire.\\" It was reported that the city has ordered the remains of the church demolished, calling them unstable. The Buildings Department quickly clarified that the inspection was not complete and they had not ordered the immediate demolition of the building. In August 2016 the parish announced that the Building Department ordered metal beams be used to shore up the walls and the building be covered with a waterproof canvas to keep it from being damaged further by the elements. The parish announced they anticipate that effort to be completed in September 2016. In May 2018 the parish filed a lawsuit against their insurer Church Mutual for $47M USD. The insurer's payment was $12.7M USD based on the 1945 purchase price and subsequent improvements. The church countered that the payment did not account for present day rebuilding costs will be approximately $60M USD. The parish and the insurer reached an undisclosed settlement in April 2019. Installation of the new roof over the nave was completed in July 2019. As of November 2019 steel I-beams for the new floor were being installed as well as framing for the windows which will be fitted with temporary acrylic panels. An image captured in March 2020 showed that the building had been enclosed.

The term Facebook diplomacy was further introduced and elaborated to describe the potential 'soft power' that can be created with Internet social networking tools like Facebook to counter terrorism, and interfere with repressive governments and militant groups in a discussion at a social networking and technology conference in December 2008 in New York. > During the December conference in New York, the United States Undersecretary > of Public Diplomacy, James Glassman said, \\"New technology gives the United > States and other free nations a significant advantage over terrorists.\\" In > his presentation at New York's Columbia University Law School, he went on to > illustrate how Facebook diplomacy and on-line activism created success > through the use of Facebook groups and the use of the platform to create > activism and cause global awareness relative to issues in Colombia against > the infamous FARC rebels. Social networking diplomacy In general, Facebook diplomacy is a user created hybrid of public diplomacy and citizen diplomacy as applied in the Facebook social networking platform. Other terms that have also evolved in this diplomacy category include Twitter diplomacy, Google diplomacy and digital diplomacy. In March 2009 some Facebook users started a Facebook users group called MUNSNE, (Model United Nations, Social Network Embassy) which changed their name to Globcal International in May. Their founding principles engaged the further development and refinement of public and citizen diplomacy as it applies for use within the Facebook Platform with the developed introduction of protocol, principles, and a best practice guide based on several ISO-like standards relative to writing, and public presentation. Globcal's public diplomacy concept differs from that of the US State Department because it offers a broad global democratic world-view instead of the United States propagandized perception as described in some public diplomacy descriptions. Facebook and Twitter ambassador Facebook ambassador is a generic term representation as an idiom or neologism that can be attributed to individual users on Facebook who have developed a Facebook page presence and professional representation on Facebook as an 'ambassador' of 'networking' that promote their agendas in a general socially beneficial manner and ideally a cooperative way in their representative appearance to other Facebook users by following Facebook best practices, strictly adhering to Facebook's policies, and by following selective hybridized protocols conducive to the generation of compounded social networking activity as a virtual communitarian, and peacemaker to promote multiple social causes and other socially beneficial activities. The 'Facebook Ambassadors' of public and citizen diplomacy include over 200 ambassadors from 87 countries that each maintain a public profile or fan page and together maintain many popular Facebook pages (on-line electronic publications) like Goodwill Ambassadors, Ambassadors of the World, Peace and Goodwill, and Age of Aquarius which collectively have nearly 250,000 subscribers. Alternatively, Facebook ambassador may also refer to Facebook Garage Ambassadors who are dedicated to the technical aspect of Facebook development.

Plot Rae Colton had originally came to Hollywood to be an actress, but her career never took off. She meets and falls in love with Wyn, an older and wealthy married businessman. The relationship with Wyn carries on for nine years, and while he takes care of her financially, she hopes that one day they can marry and possibly have a child. With much time on her hands due to Wyn's support, Rae fills her life with acting lessons and her friendship with Margo, another aspiring actress. Their friend Stephanie did make it as an actress and even has her own television show. While Rae aspires to get to that level, she becomes somewhat complacent over time, not having any immediate financial worries because of her seemingly comfortable situation, as Wyn has provided her with a home and vehicle. Rae's world is shattered when Wyn dies suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep while on a trip to the Bahamas with her. Rae finds out that Wyn's wife has taken over his company, and as everything she had was legally in his name, she has no deed to her home or title to her car. Wyn also had no will, thus everything he owned now belongs to his wife, leaving Rae all but destitute. With little money and almost no options, Rae moves into a house that is listed for sale by Margo's friend. But the house quickly sells, forcing Rae out. She returns home to Utah to visit her mother, Deanie, and begins a relationship with Burke Johnson, a former high school classmate who has always been in love with her. Rae's mother is deeply disappointed in her for seeing Burke, and tells her to go back to Hollywood and try again to make it as an actress. Rae pleads with her mother to understand that she will never make it big in Hollywood, but eventually bows to pressure and decides to go back. Rae returns to Los Angeles and takes Stephanie up on her offer to stay in her guest house. Rae calls Burke and asks him to meet her in Las Vegas, where she hopes to convince him to resume their relationship in California, away from her mother's influence. He reluctantly agrees, but then doesn't show up. Rae returns to Los Angeles, lonelier than before. She turns to drinking to ease the pain of her shattered life, and tries working in a department store with little success. Rae meets two German businessmen in a club when she is out with Margo and, having too much to drink, sleeps with one of them. She is shocked and hurt when he mistakes her for a prostitute. Rae realizes she has to survive somehow, and will likely never become more than a 'kept' woman. She asks Margo if she can introduce her to any available men. She meets Ben Wasburn, and makes an agreement to become his mistress. However, it turns out to be a situation far less romantic than what she had with Wyn. She beats Ben in a game of pool and he sends her a black mink coat as a present. As the movie ends, Rae and Margo are admiring the coat in the mirror and Rae recounts a time when she was young and driving in the woods in Utah with her father. She tells Margo that the two of them came across a deer that had gotten trapped in barbed wire and had died. According to Rae, her father explained to her that deer have an ability to die when trapped. That their hearts simply just explode. A wistful Rae gazes at her image in the mirror. Without looking at Margo, she says \\"You know what I wish? I wish I was a deer,\\" alluding to own feeling of entrapment and no other way out, as the movie ends here.

Initially a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, he helped him in his purge and massacre of Communists in 1927, but eventually became a leading internal rival of the Kuomintang leader, accusing him of weakness in the face of Japanese aggression and of submission to Western financial interests. The two eventually reached an understanding, and Li went on to hold important military commands during the Second Sino‚ÄìJapanese War. After the end of the war, however, new disagreements with Chiang led to Li's expulsion from the Kuomintang; he then became leader of the splinter Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, collaborated with Mao Zedong and held high office in the new Communist People's Republic. Early life and military career Li was born into a wealthy land-owning family (with Confucian scholars among his ancestors) in Cangwu County, Wuzhou, Guangxi, in 1886.Cihai Editorial Committee (eds). \\"Cihai\\" (1989 edition), p. 3319 Shanghai Lexicographic Publishing House. 1989. His mother died when he was four years old. Li enrolled at Wuzhou Middle School, where he studied under the right wing Kuomintang leader Hu Hanmin, and in 1904 he entered the Liangguang Accelerated Army Academy of the Qing Imperial Army in Guangdong. After graduation three years later, he was selected for advanced study at the Beiyang Army Officers Academy in Beijing (which later became the Baoding Military Academy). He interrupted his studies after the Wuchang revolt of October 1911 to serve as chief of staff of the 22nd Division of the revolutionary army in Jiangsu. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Li completed his education and remained at the Beijing academy, now called the Military Staff College, this time as an instructor. Li returned to Guangdong in 1921 at the invitation of Guangdong Army chief of staff Deng Keng. Deng was assassinated in March 1922, and Chen Jiongming staged a coup in June of that year, which Li helped to put down. For this, he received command of the army's 1st Division. In 1924, after serving briefly as commissioner of reconstruction of the West River-Wuzhou area and as Wuzhou garrison commander, Li became Deputy Dean of the newly established Whampoa Military Academy under Chiang Kai-shek. After Sun Yat-sen's death in March 1925, the Guangdong government was reorganized as the National Government, and Li was appointed commander of the 4th Army, which had formerly been the Guangdong Army. He spent the next year destroying Chen Jiongming's remaining power. When the Northern Expedition began in July 1926, Li's 4th Army joined the push northward. During this time, Li also served as Governor of Guangdong, military affairs commissioner, and acting president of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1927, he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and helped Chiang in the purge and massacre of Communists. In November 1927, Li left Guangdong with Wang Jingwei to attend a plenary session of the Committee in Shanghai on the subject of restoring party unity. In his absence, Zhang Fakui staged a coup. However, officers loyal to Li successfully put down the coup, forcing Zhang to surrender, and Li returned to Guangdong on 4 January 1928. On 7 February 1928, Li was made a member of the standing committee of the Military Affairs Commission. He was also made commander in chief of the newly established Eighth Route Army. On 1 March, Li became chairman of the Guangdong branch of the Political Council of the Kuomintang, and on 30 March he was made chief of the general staff of the Northern Expedition. During the remainder of the year, Li attended meetings in Beijing, and briefly served as acting commander in chief of the Nationalist forces when Chiang Kai-shek left Beijing for Nanjing. He was appointed to the State Council on 8 October and resigned as Governor of Guangdong in November. Fujian People's Government, Second Sino‚ÄìJapanese War and the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang In 1929, Li traveled to Nanjing to attend the 3rd National Congress and mediate a dispute that had arisen between the Nationalist government and the New Guangxi clique. However, talks broke down in March, the members of the clique were expelled from the Kuomintang, and Li was placed in detention. He was not freed until after the Japanese attack on Mukden in 1931. In 1933, Li joined forces with Chen Mingshu to launch a successful military revolt in Fujian, and, after the initial seizure of power, became Chairman of the Fujian People's Government. In 1934, however, the revolt was crushed by Chiang Kai- shek, and Li was forced to flee to Hong Kong in January 1934. In 1935, Li joined with associates to found the Chinese People's Revolutionary League, which advocated resistance against Japan and overthrow of the Nationalist government. In 1936, Li participated in a joint Guangdong-Guangxi revolt against the government, but after it collapsed, Li returned to Hong Kong. The order for his arrest was rescinded by Chiang. In 1938, in the name of unity against the Japanese threat, Li was restored to membership in the Kuomintang, and again became a member of the Military Affairs Commission and the State Council. During the Sino-Japanese War, Li served in several military posts. In 1944, he was appointed president of the Military Advisory Council, and worked to consolidate resistance against Japan in southern Guangxi. At the 6th National Congress of the Kuomintang in May 1945, Li was elected to the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang, and served as a delegate to the National Assembly the following year. On 8 March 1947, Li issued a statement calling for reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. For this, he was again expelled from the Kuomintang on Chiang's orders, for \\"making unwarranted statements and inciting the people to riot\\". Li began working to unite current and former Kuomintang members who opposed Chiang Kai- shek. This led to the formation of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in 1948, with Li as its first Chairman. In the People's Republic of China Li left Hong Kong in early 1949 and traveled north to Beijing, invited by Mao Zedong, and assisted in the preparatory work for the founding of the new People's Republic of China. After the inauguration of the new Communist government, Li went on to hold very important posts, serving as Vice Chairman of the People's Republic from 1949 to 1954, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress (1954‚Äì1959), and Vice Chairman the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1949‚Äì1959).

It is free-flowing and odorless. Its color fades from yellowish to colorless when diluted. At 4.25 g/cm3 at , saturated Clerici solution is one of the highest known density aqueous solutions. The solution was invented in 1907 by the Italian chemist Enrico Clerici (1862‚Äì1938). Its value in mineralogy and gemology was reported in 1930s. It allows the separation of minerals by density with a traditional flotation method. Its advantages include transparency and an easily controllable density in the range 1‚Äì5 g/cm3. Saturated Clerici solution is more dense than spinel, garnet, diamond, and corundum, as well as many other minerals. A saturated Clerici solution at can separate densities up to 4.2 g/cm3, while a saturated solution at can separate densities up to 5.0 g/cm3. The change in density is due to the increased solubility of the heavy thallium salts at the higher temperature. A range of solution densities between 1.0 and 5.0 g/cm3 can be achieved by diluting with water. The refractive index shows significant, linear and well reproducible variation with the density; it changes from 1.44 for 2 g/cm3 to 1.70 for 4.28 g/cm3. Thus the density can be easily measured by optical techniques. The color of the Clerici solution changes significantly upon minor dilution. In particular, at room temperature the concentrated solution with the density of 4.25 g/cm3 is amber-yellow. However, a minor dilution with water to the density of 4.0 g/cm3 makes it as transparent as glass or water (absorption threshold 350 nm). Procedure for determining mineral density using the Clerici solution are available. One drawback of the Clerici solution is its high toxicity and corrosiveness. Today sodium polytungstate has been introduced as a replacement, but its solutions do not reach as high in density as the Clerici solution.

The area belongs to the traditional Styria region and is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region.Municipality of Gornji Grad website Name The name Dol is a common toponym in Slovenia. It is derived from the common noun dol 'small valley', referring to a local geographical feature. Dol was formerly known as ≈†tajngrob or ≈†tajngrob ob Dreti in Slovene. Before the settlement was renamed, Dol was the name of a hamlet of ≈†tajngrob. The older name is derived from German but underwent folk etymology, in which the final element (originally German -grube 'depression, basin') was changed to Slovene -grob 'grave'.Majdiƒç, Viktor. 2002. \\"Imena vasi in mest v Sloveniji.\\" Jezikoslovni zapiski 8(2): 81‚Äì92, p. 89.

The Ravni 2 Mass Grave () is located above Dreta Creek, about south of the Prodnik farm. Together with the Ravni 1 Mass Grave in neighboring Gornji Grad, it contains the remains of 100 to 200 Slovene civilians executed by the Partisan command of the Fourth Operation Zone in the fall of 1944.

Its creator is unknown. Evidence suggests it was made before 1912, so it may predate the earliest displays of Western animated films in Japan. It was discovered in a collection of films and projectors in Kyoto in 2005. The three-second filmstrip depicts a boy who writes \\"\\", removes his hat, and bows. The frames were stencilled in red and black using a device for making magic lantern slides, and the filmstrip was fastened in a loop for continuous play. Description Katsud≈ç Shashin Katsud≈ç Shashin consists of a series of cartoon images on fifty frames of a celluloid strip and lasts three seconds at sixteen frames per second. It depicts a young boy in a sailor suit who writes the kanji characters \\"\\" (katsud≈ç shashin, \\"moving picture\\") from right to left, then turns to the viewer, removes his hat, and bows. Katsud≈ç Shashin is a provisional title for the film, whose actual title is unknown. Unlike in traditional animation, the frames were not produced by photographing the images, but rather were impressed onto film using a stencil. This was done with a kappa-ban, a device for stencilling magic lantern slides. The images were in red and black on a strip of 35 mm film whose ends were fastened in a loop for continuous viewing. Background Early printed animation films for optical toys such as the zoetrope predated projected film animation. German toy manufacturer Gebr√ºder Bing presented a cinematograph at a toy festival in Nuremberg in 1898; soon other toy manufacturers sold similar devices. Live-action films for these devices were expensive to make; possibly as early as 1898 animated films for these devices were on sale, and could be fastened in loops for continuous viewing. Imports of these German devices appeared in Japan at least as early as 1904; films for them likely included animation loops. Japanese animated films such as Jun'ichi K≈çuchi's Hanawa Hekonai meit≈ç no maki began appearing in theatres in 1917. Projected film technology arrived in Japan from the West in 1896‚Äì97. The earliest display of foreign animation in Japanese theatres that can be dated with certainty is of the French animator √âmile Cohl's The Nipper's Transformations (1911), which premi√®red in Tokyo on 15 April 1912. Works by ≈åten Shimokawa, Seitar≈ç Kitayama, and Jun'ichi K≈çuchi in 1917 were the first Japanese animated films to reach theatre screens. The films are lost, but a few have been discovered in \\"toy movie\\" versions for viewing at home on hand-cranked projectors; the oldest to survive is Hanawa Hekonai meit≈ç no maki (1917), titled Namakura-gatana in its home version. Rediscovery In December 2004, a secondhand dealer in Kyoto contacted Natsuki Matsumoto, an expert in iconography at the Osaka University of Arts. The dealer had obtained a collection of films and projectors from an old Kyoto family, and Matsumoto arrived the next month to fetch them. The collection included three projectors, eleven 35mm films, and thirteen glass magic lantern slides. When Matsumoto found Katsud≈ç Shashin in the collection, the filmstrip was in poor condition. The collection included three Western animated filmstrips; Katsud≈ç Shashin may have been made in imitation of such examples of German or other Western animation. Based on evidence such as the likely manufacture dates of the projectors in the collection, Matsumoto and animation historian determined the film was most likely made in the late Meiji period, which ended in 1912; historian Frederick S. Litten has suggested as a likely date, and that \\"a production date before 1905 or after 1912 is unlikely\\". At the time, movie theatres were rare in Japan; evidence suggests Katsud≈ç Shashin was mass- produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors. The creator of the filmstrip remains unknown; to Matsumoto, the relatively poor quality and low- tech printing technique indicate it was likely from a smaller company. The discovery was widely covered in Japanese media. Given its speculated date of creation, the film would have been contemporary to‚Äîor even have predated‚Äîearly animated works by Cohl and the American animators J. Stuart Blackton and Winsor McCay. The newspaper Asahi Shimbun acknowledged the importance of the discovery of Meiji-period animation, but expressed reservations about placing the film in the genealogy of Japanese animation, writing that it is \\"controversial that should even be called animation in the contemporary sense\\".

Contents The Directive came into force across Europe during 2009 and in the UK it became law on 1 March 2009 converting the various national Pollution Prevention Guidelines (PPGs) such as the UK PPG11, PPG18 and PPG21 into requirements where failure to comply can result in fines and more significantly reformation / reinstatement costs which can run into many millions of Euro. Unlike the 96/82/EC so-called Seveso II Directive which applies to large high risk businesses the Environmental Liability Directive applies to all businesses large and small alike. Simply there is no excuse and owners/Directors who ignore the Directive and cause a major incident can end up in jail. Two of the most important considerations within the Directive are the containment of spills and firewater. Spills could be anything from milk through, cooking oil through to oils from your parking lot's oil interceptor or a bio-hazard. Firewater is the runoff when you have a fire, this is a cocktail of water, foam and whatever you were storing. It can be deadly and have a major impact to the environment should it escape from your site. Hence, key in the Directive is an Environmental Management System [EMS] that to contain spills and firewater on their site for safe disposal later. Trawl the internet and you will find some good examples of automatic spill and firewater containment systems that use the drains on the site a high capacity storage vessels. These systems tend to use inflatable pneumatic bladders, lockable flap valves or motorised penstock valves to seal the site. Sandbags and spill kits can also be used but these are really only suitable for low volume spills and certainly are dangerous to deploy when hazardous substances or fires are involved. Amendment The ELD has been amended three times through Directive 2006/21/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries, through Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide, and through the Offshore Safety Directive 2013/30/EU, on safety of offshore oil and gas operations. The amendments broadened the scope of strict liability by adding the \\"management of extractive waste\\" and the \\"operation of storage sites pursuant to Directive 2009/31/EC\\" to the list of dangerous occupational activities in Annex III of the ELD.

She became the second wife of Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, a favourite of King Richard II of England.Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Earls of Oxford  Origins  Nothing is known about the origins of Agnes. According to Costain,Thomas B. Costain, The Last Plantagenets, Popular Library, New York, 1962, p.128 she was described as a countess (from a German or Netherlandish family) and also as the daughter of a Flemish saddler. While her rank and nationality are unknown, what proved significant was that in English society she was not considered a suitable spouse for an earl.  Marriage to the Earl of Oxford  Agnes accompanied Anne of Bohemia, the future consort of King Richard II to England in December 1381. She served in the capacity of Lady of the Bedchamber, and was also the custodian of the jewels and valuables given to Queen Anne by her mother, Elizabeth of Pomerania.Costain, p.128 Anne was duly married to King Richard and crowned Queen consort on 22 January 1382. On an unknown date, Agnes caught the eye of the King's favourite, Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, Marquess of Dublin, Duke of Ireland. She has been described as \\"dark and lively, with a foreign kind of prettiness\\". She became de Vere's mistress, and then in 1387, he repudiated and subsequently divorced his wife, Philippa de Coucy and promptly married Agnes. This created a scandal throughout the kingdom, especially as Philippa was the first cousin of the King, being the youngest daughter of his aunt, Isabella of England. Her royal uncles, the Dukes of Lancaster, Gloucester, and York were especially angered.Barbara W. Tuchman, A Distant Mirror, p.467 Even his own mother, Maud de Ufford took Philippa's side against her son, saying that she held Philippa \\"more dear than if she had been her own daughter\\", and cursed Robert for his actions.Linda Clark, Authority and Subversion, p.26, Google Books, retrieved on 6-11-09 She took Philippa into her own household,Tuchman,p.468 while Robert brought Agnes to live with him in Chester. As for Queen Anne's reaction to the scandalous conduct of her Lady of the Bedchamber, there are two versions. The first is that the Queen disapproved of de Vere's repudiation of his highborn wife to marry her Lady of the Bedchamber. The second version is that Queen Anne, through genuine fondness for Agnes, wrote to the Pope, urging him to grant the divorce. The latter story was circulated throughout England, with the result that Anne lost some of the popularity she had previously enjoyed.Costain, pp.128-129 The divorce was granted to de Vere upon false evidence which he had submitted to the Pope.Costain, p.129 It was his love for Agnes that had kept de Vere from taking up his duties in Ireland where there was rebellion, which he had been given regal powers to quell.Tuchman, p.467 By this time, de Vere had made many enemies amongst the nobles who resented the high favour in which de Vere was held by the King. In point of fact, it was his close relationship to King Richard which was the catalyst for the formation of the Lords Appellant which was an organised group of noblemen who seized political control of the kingdom from King Richard. In the same year of his marriage to Agnes, de Vere led royal forces against the Lords Appellant but the former were defeated at Radcot Bridge on 20 December 1387, and de Vere, after escaping by leaping into the river on horseback and galloping away on the other side, made his way to London. He was forced into exile by Parliament in 1388 and went to live in Louvain, Brabant. Robert de Vere was subsequently declared a traitor, and his honours and properties were forfeited. Agnes never held the titles of Countess of Oxford or Duchess of Ireland, as Philippa continued to use those titles after the divorce. Pope Urban VI declared de Vere's divorce to Philippa invalid on 17 October 1389. It is likely that Agnes returned to Bohemia instead of having accompanied her husband into exile in Brabant.Costain, p.176 In 1392, Robert de Vere died of the injuries he had sustained during a boar hunt. He was succeeded as Earl of Oxford by his uncle, Aubrey de Vere, as neither of his two marriages had produced children.

He has significantly influenced the art scene in Denmark both through his \\"happenings\\" and his sculptures in Danish cities. Although he has specialized in sculpture since 1970, his greatest achievement is perhaps his work in designing Queen Margrethe II's tapestries. N√∏rgaard was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1985 to 1994. His main workshop is in the village of Bissinge on the island of M√∏n.Bissinge from the Danish wikipedia. A versatile artist N√∏rgaard studied in the 1960s at the newly founded Copenhagen School of Experimental Art where, as a 17-year-old, he came into contact with artists such as Per Kirkeby and Richard Winther. Influenced by the German performance artist Joseph Beuys, he was involved in collaborative works and happenings where he found new ways to give artistic expression to the left-wing causes of the time. One of the most striking of these was \\"The Female Christ\\" (1969) when his wife Lene Adler Petersen walked naked with a cross through the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in order to remind society of Christ's visit to the temple. Trading was suspended for the rest of the day. Another was his \\"Horse Sacrifice\\" (1970) where he slaughtered a horse on a field in the north of Zealand and carved it up into small pieces which he put into hundreds of jam jars. Here he was successful in encouraging the press to focus on the Vietnam War and hunger in Biafra. The happening caused quite a commotion and debate.Portr√¶t - Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard. From KunstOnLine.dk.

Much of his work involves sculpture where he is adept at combining themes from art and culture, providing a new perspective on topics of current interest. His interest in history is certainly one of the reasons why he was chosen in 1990 to design the large-scale sketches for the tapestries tracing the history of Denmark at the request of Queen Margrethe.Tapestries for the Queen of Denmark.

Key works N√∏rgaard has been extremely active since the 1970s, producing a wide selection of sculptures and architectural works. Some of the most widely recognized are described below. Gladsaxe Library N√∏rgaard's first commission, which he received in 1979, was to decorate the recently completed Gladsaxe Library just outside Copenhagen. Aiming to instill interest in disappearing local crafts, he covered the pillars in the main reading room with leather, mirrors, tape and tiles. In the courtyard, he placed a glass pyramid and a tower reaching for the sky as well as two bronze statues modelled on himself and his wife. The facade was covered with numerous cartoon figures and film strips. In the entrance hall, he built a ceramic den which proved a major attraction for children.Bygninger og Faciliteter.

On 26 April 2018, the identity of Witness C was revealed as Robert Conchie Harris. He had originally been convicted of the double murder of a couple in 1983. Disappearance On 8 April 1989, backpacking tourists H√∂glin and Paakkonen from Storfors, Sweden went into the bush near Thames. They vanished and were reported missing in May. The disappearance led to an intense police investigation under the name Operation Stockholm and attracted substantial media interest. Police, local residents, search and rescue and military personnel carried out the largest land-based search undertaken in New Zealand, performing grid-searches centred on Crosbie's Clearing, 12 km from Thames.  David Tamihere   Background  David Tamihere is the brother of former MP John Tamihere. David Tamihere had a prior conviction for the manslaughter of an Auckland stripper, 23-year-old Mary Barcham, whom he killed in 1972 when he was 18 by hitting her on the head with a rifle. In April 1986 he broke into an Auckland house, where he sexually violated and threatened to kill a 47-year-old woman over six hours. He pleaded guilty, but fled while on bail and was still at large, living rough in the bush on the Coromandel Peninsula when the two tourists disappeared. He was not found until 1989 after which he was jailed for six and a half years for the 1986 offences. In 1992 he was found guilty of assaulting a 62-year-old woman in her home in 1985.  Trial  After absconding, David Tamihere lived rough in the bush in the Coromandel area for three years before Hoglin and Paakonen disappeared. He moved around in the area and said, after his arrest on the rape case, that he came across the Swedish couple's white Subaru on 10 April 1989. It was parked at Crosbies Clearing and 'loaded with gear'. He says he broke into the car, planning on driving up to Auckland, but the next day, he gave three visitors to the area a tour of the peninsula. He drove one of the tourists to Auckland the day after that and dumped the car at the Auckland Railway Station. Tamihere was picked up on the 1986 rape charge on 24 May 1989, two days before the story broke that the Swedes were missing. His link to the Swedish couple surfaced when one of the three tourists recognised photographs of the Swedish couple's car and told police in June 1989 that Tamihere had given him a ride in it. Tamihere was already in prison on the rape charge when he was charged with murdering the Swedes. He was tried for their murders in October 1990. At the trial, three witnesses (fellow inmates of Tamihere's, granted name suppression by the court) gave evidence that Tamihere had confessed the murder to them. One of the inmates told the court that Tamihere said he tied H√∂glin to a tree and sexually abused him before raping Paakkonen. Two trampers also identified Tamihere as a man they saw with a woman believed to be Paakkonen in a remote clearing.R v Tamihere (No 2) (1990) 7 CRNZ 594 In December 1990, the jury found Tamihere guilty of the murder and theft, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 10-year non-parole period.  Appeals  Paakkonen's body has never been found. In October 1991, ten months after Tamihere's conviction, pig hunters discovered Hoglin's body near Whangamata 73 km from where police alleged the murders took place. With the body was a watch which police had claimed at his trial Tamihere had given to his son following the murders. Discovery of the body also contradicted the testimony of the fellow prison inmate who said Tamihere had confessed to cutting up the bodies and throwing them into the ocean (and that he had sexually abused the couple). Based on these evidential discrepancies, Tamihere appealed his convictions. The Court of Appeal of New Zealand rejected the case in May 1992 arguing there was \\"nothing substantive in defence claims that the skeleton revealed new evidence\\" and that the Crown had provided \\"convincing circumstantial proof\\". In 1994 Tamihere was also denied leave to appeal to the Privy Council.  Parole  On 3 November 2010, Tamihere was granted parole, to be released on 15 November. At a parole board hearing on 11 November 2011 he was said to have spent several months in hospital due to on-going health issues but was otherwise actively involved in marae activities and carving, being actively supported by his family. His parole conditions were relaxed. Tamihere continues to maintain his innocence, claiming he was framed by police. A 2012 interview with TV One's Sunday current affairs program, in which he advanced this claim, was widely watched with 413,300 viewers. During filming, the film crew flew him by helicopter over areas prohibited to him by his parole conditions and while the parole board chose not to revoke his parole, police charged him in relation to the incident.  Royal prerogative of mercy  On 21 April 2020, Tamihere was granted a royal prerogative of mercy by the governor-general, Dame Patsy Reddy, on the advice of the Minister of Justice, Andrew Little, which means that the case will be referred back to the Court of Appeal.  Secret Witness C  Three prison inmates testified against Tamihere at his trial. One of them, known as Secret Witness C, who has permanent name suppression, claimed that Tamihere confessed to him in prison that he had beaten Urban H√∂glin over the head with a lump of wood and dumped the couple's bodies at sea. He also claimed Tamihere told him he gave Hoglin's watch to his son. H√∂glin's remains were eventually found near Whangamata on 10 October 1991 with his skull still intact and the watch still on his wrist. On 25 August 1995, five years after the trial, Witness C swore an affidavit retracting this statement, saying police had fed him the information, and told him: ‚Äúa sum of money up to $100,000 was available should I decide to give a statement helpful to the Police\\". The prisoner also claimed the police indicated they would support his early release at his parole hearing if he did what they wanted.Report By The Police Complaints Authority On The Investigation Into The Validity Of Affidavit Of Witness C, Police Complaints Authority. 3 September 1996. The existence of this affidavit only came to light a year later on 17 July 1996, when Witness C spoke to broadcaster Paul Holmes in a prison telephone interview. He publicly admitted to lying at Tamihere's trial and confirmed that the affidavit he had signed in 1995, stating that he had lied and given false evidence, was the truth. He told Holmes that his original testimony against Tamihere had been \\"playing on his mind\\" and \\"they definitely have an innocent man inside\\".Witness C perjury trial scrutinises Sir Paul Holmes prison phone interview from 1996, NZ Herald, 30 August 2017 The publicity created immediate concerns about police conduct in the case, leading a Member of Parliament to request a ministerial inquiry. The Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) was also asked to investigate the police handling of the case. The IPCA eventually concluded that the police had not been guilty of any wrongdoing, and Minister of Justice Doug Graham rejected a call for further inquiry. Witness C later tried to withdraw his affidavit and claimed that his original trial testimony was the correct version of events. He said he only signed the affidavit because he and his family were under threat of violent reprisal because of his reputation as a jailhouse \\"nark\\". Twenty years later, long after Tamihere had been released on parole, jailhouse lawyer Arthur Taylor brought a private prosecution against Witness C for perjury. In August 2017, Witness C, who still has name suppression, was found guilty on eight charges of perjury. Taylor was represented in court by lawyer Murray Gibson, who said the verdict called into question everything about Mr. Tamihere's conviction. On 25 October 2017, Witness C was sentenced to 8 years 7 months on each of the eight charges of perjury, the sentences to be served concurrently. On 26 April 2018, the identity of Witness C, the prisoner whose false testimony in 1990 helped convict David Tamihere to jail for 20 years, was revealed as Robert Conchie Harris. He had originally been convicted of the double murder of a couple in 1983. Other developments In November 2009, New Zealand journalist Pat Booth, formerly a journalist of the Auckland Star, alleged that the Crown prosecutor and the police inquiry head in the Tamihere case were both leading figures in the earlier prosecution of Arthur Allan Thomas which had involved the planting of evidence, perjury, and withholding of information and evidence from the defence. In May 2017, Alan Ford, an experienced bushman, found a plastic bag containing three pairs of women's leggings in the rugged bush on the WhangamƒÅtƒÅ Peninsula about 15 km from where Urban H√∂glin's remains had been found. Ford took the bag and clothing to the Whangamata police station. Two months later, a police constable emailed him saying that his senior officer had \\"no interest in the items\\" and that they wouldn't be testing them. The constable said Ford could pick up the items the next time he came to town. On 7 July, Ford went to the police station but was told the items had been destroyed on 9 June, a month before the constable had indicated by email that the items still existed. Media interest The TV3 show Inside New Zealand: What's Your Verdict? re-examined the case with a television jury in 2007. Filmmaker Bryan Bruce made a documentary Murder, They Said in 1996 examining the case, and wrote the book Hard Cases, which puts forward the theory Tamihere did not act alone, on the basis that as there were no defensive cuts to the bones of his hands, H√∂glin may have been held from behind while being stabbed from the front. In 1999, Leanne Pooley made a television documentary Relative Guilt about the impact on Tamihere's extended family of his arrest, trial and conviction. The documentary won Best Documentary at the 2000 Qantas Media Awards.

QRA response Air traffic across Europe is controlled by Eurocontrol in Brussels. Military aircraft from Russia can be tracked across Norway, and reported to the Norwegian Joint Headquarters near Bod√∏, or the Combined Air Operations Centre 2 (CAOC UE) in Uedem, North Rhine- Westphalia close to the border with The Netherlands. Combined Air Operations Centre Finderup (CAOC Finderup),Finderup history PDF in Denmark, watches Russian aircraft and can alert the UK, and has RAF staff there. The Russian Tu-95 Bear aircraft originate from the Olenya base on the Kola Peninsula and the Tu-160 Blackjack aircraft come from the Engels-2 base near Saratov. The Bear aircraft are on 12-14 hour missions, and when tracked across Norway have been colloquially referred to with the codename of zombies. A QRA response involves the fighter aircraft being scrambled to investigate an infringement of the NATO country's airspace or area of interest. QRA response in the United Kingdom This may also be a civilian aircraft that poses a threat, if not sufficiently responding to air traffic control (ATC); incidents of this nature in the UK are monitored by the Control and Reporting Centres (CRC) at RAF Boulmer and RAF Scampton, which builds a 3D Recognised Air Picture and the National Air Defence Operations Centre (NADOC) RAF Air Command, if notified, decides whether to send a QRA response.

History Quick Reaction Alert is the current development from scrambling by RAF Fighter Command in the Battle of Britain. Germany RAF Wildenrath provided air defence cover for Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG), which flew Phantoms with 92 Sqn and 19 Sqn until 1991. On 25 May 1982, RAF Phantom XV422 of 92 Sqn shot down RAF Jaguar XX963 of 14 Sqn from RAF Bruggen with a Sidewinder, over Germany, by mistake when the Phantom pilot did not realise that he was fully armed.

The ROTOR system was developed in the 1950s. Before computers arrived in the 1970s, the Russian aircraft were plotted on a map, mainly by WRAF personnel. 11 Group (at RAF Bentley Priory from 1968 and RAF High Wycombe from 1972) looked after the UK's air defence until the 1990s; High Wycombe today has the European Air Group. Every QRA alert required a Victor tanker from RAF Marham in Norfolk, which the codename Dragonfly. One fighter squadron would be on QRA for six month shifts. The Phantom had much better range than the Lightning, and had far-better look down radar, but the Lightning had better performance. The RAF Phantom variant had Spey engines, which were not intentionally designed for the aircraft, and gave lower performance; it had an advanced jam-resistant inertial navigation system but the RAF Phantoms could not take off immediately as this inertial system had to align first. The Lightning left service in 1988 and the Phantom in 1992. Only when the Tornado F.3 arrived did RAF QRA duty have an aircraft that had complete night-vision capabilities and could connect to the Sentry aircraft. In the 1960s, Southern Q was at maintained by the Lightnings of 5 Sqn at RAF Binbrook and those of 29 Sqn and 111 Squadron at RAF Wattisham. Southern Q was rotated around the three RAF bases. RAF Leeming took over Southern Q from RAF Coningsby in 1988. 11 Sqn left RAF Leeming in October 2005,Tornado F3 in Focus: A Navigator's Eye on Britain's Last Interceptor then on 29 June 2007, 3 Sqn at RAF Coningsby took over Southern Q from the Tornados of 25 Sqn at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, with the Typhoons of 3 Sqn having their first scramble on 17 August 2007 when they intercepted a Russian Bear; 3 Sqn took over all of Southern Q from 1 April 2008. In August 2007 the Russians had begun to launch long-distance patrols after a 15-year hiatus. Typhoons arrived at RAF Leuchars with 6 Sqn from 6 September 2010, performing their first QRA scramble on 2 January 2011, with Typhoons joining 1 Sqn from 15 September 2012. 6 Sqn moved to Lossiemouth in June 2014, with 1 Sqn moving in August 2014. QRA North was moved from RAF Leuchars to RAF Lossiemouth on 1 September 2014. The first QRA sortie from Lossiemouth was on 19 September 2014 with 6 Sqn. 2012 Olympics To cover the security for the 2012 Summer Olympics, part of QRA South was briefly deployed from RAF Coningsby to operate from RAF Northolt.

He is best known for writing the government's brief in Brown v. Board of Education. Early life Elman was born in Paterson, New Jersey, to Polish-Jewish immigrants who worked in the silk industry. During the Great Depression, he moved with his family to New York City, where he attended DeWitt Clinton High School and the City College of New York. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review in 1938 and 1939.The Solicitor General's Office, Justice Frankfurter, and Civil Rights Litigation: An Oral History. 100 Harvard Law Review 4 [1987] Legal career Judicial clerkships Elman began his legal career as a law clerk to Judge Calvert Magruder of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, 1939‚Äì1940. After a brief stint at the Federal Communications Commission (1940‚Äì1941), he served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter from 1941 to 1943. Among the opinions Elman was involved in drafting during his clerkship was Frankfurter's dissent in the second Flag Salute case, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. Elman and Frankfurter remained close friends; Elman would later recount that Frankfurter still regarded him as his clerk for years after Elman had joined the Justice Department. Solicitor General's office After his clerkship with Frankfurter, Elman joined the United States Department of Justice, where he worked as an assistant to the Solicitor General of the United States from 1944 to 1961. He took part in drafting briefs and arguments for a number of civil rights cases, including Shelley v. Kraemer. In his oral history about his time at the Solicitor General's office, Elman recounted his involvement in Brown v. Board of Education. He explained how the Solicitor General's brief used the phrase \\"with all deliberate speed\\": > It's because we were the first to suggest, and all the parties and amicus on > both sides rejected it after the government proposed it, that if the Court > should hold that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional, > it should give the district courts a reasonable period of time to work out > the details and timing of the implementation of the decision. In other > words, \\"with all deliberate speed\\". Elman wanted a \\"middle ground\\" between reaffirming the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson and requiring immediate integration of all public schools, even though that meant separating the constitutional principle from the judicial remedy. He believed that otherwise the Supreme Court could not have decided the case unanimously and the American public would not have tolerated the decision. According to Elman, he borrowed the deliberate speed concept from antitrust cases and boundary dispute cases in the United States Supreme Court, particularly opinions by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., but he had difficulty tracking down the phrase's precise origin. Researchers from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People later discovered the phrase in Francis Thompson's poem, The Hound of Heaven. Federal Trade Commission Elman wanted to become an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, but an interview with then-United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy did not go as he had hoped. Instead, Elman was nominated to a seat on the Federal Trade Commission. The United States Senate confirmed the nomination. Elman served on the FTC from 1961 to 1970. While at the FTC, his main agenda was enforcing federal laws against false advertising. His actions led to the FTC requiring warning labels on cigarette packs in the United States. One of Elman's assistants at the FTC was a young Richard Posner, who went on to become a professor at University of Chicago Law School and a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.Richard Posner's biography at University of Chicago Law School Later in life Elman taught at Georgetown University Law Center from 1970 to 1976. Elman admitted in his oral history that he and Justice Frankfurter conferred privately about the intended remedy in the case, which technically constituted a breach of judicial ethics. He was publicly criticized for this in 1987 by Time and The New York Times. Elman defended both himself and Justice Frankfurter by stating that these discussions took place before the United States became a party to the case, and even then, the United States was not an adversary party but rather an amicus curiae. Elman died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in 1999.

According to the European Commission Transportation Department ‚Äúit has been estimated that up to 25% of accidents involving trucks can be attributable to inadequate cargo securing‚Äù. Cargo that is improperly secured can cause severe accidents and lead to the loss of cargo, lives, and vehicles, or cause environmental hazards. Background Because of globalization, the subsequent flow of goods that are transported over greater distances, containerization and new regulatory measures‚Äù. will lead to a greater demand for efficient, cost effective and environmentally friendly cargo restraint products. Many types of cargo such as corrugated fiberboard boxes are often formed into a unit load. This often consists of items on a pallet unitized by stretch wrap, shrink wrap, pressure-sensitive tape, or strapping. Larger shipping containers such as crates are often on skids and are ready for loading. These unit loads are placed in intermodal containers, trucks, or railroad cars for shipment. Some large bundled items or large machinery are placed directly into or onto the transport vehicle for shipment. Load securing functions to hold the unit pallet loads, crates, or other items immobile and secure. An unsecured load can shift in transit and create dangerous dynamics, damaging the cargo and the structure of the vehicle or intermodal container. Methods There are many different ways and materials available to stabilize and secure cargo in vehicles and intermodal containers. Often combinations of load securing methods are use. For example a load can be blocked against the headboard of the truck and have webbing restraints tying it down. Blocking and bracing Blocking and bracing is a load securement method using lumber and metal bars to reduce or inhibit front to rear shifting of freight/cargo. Plastic forms are also used. Blocking and Bracing with timber Fasteners Depending on the type of load and the particular vehicle, large bolts and nails may be used. These may be on the load itself or on wood blocks used to brace the load. Fasteners rely on the constructional strength of the Cargo Transport Unit (CTU). Dunnage Dunnage for securing cargo includes scrap wood to fill voids in cargo, wooden boards forming \\"cribs\\", blocking and bracing, and modern mechanical, spring-loaded post-and-socket systems, Dunnage segregates cargo in the hold and prevents shifting of the cargo in response to ship or vehicle motions. Dunnage stresses the constructional strength of the Cargo Transport Unit (CTU). Strapping Polyester strapping and dunnage bag application Strapping is used to create a transportable unit. Types of strapping include steel, polyester, polypropylene, nylon, paper, and composites. The type of strap used depends on the requirements, for example, strength, elasticity, ability to withstand various environments, ease of use, safety, and cost. Strapping methods and limits should be according to valid standard, for example EN12195. All types of tensioned strapping, particularly steel, need to be handled carefully because of potential injury. Lashing Polyester Lashing application Lashing is the securing of cargo for transportation with the goal of minimizing shifting. Items used for lashing include ropes, cables, wires, chains, strapping, and nets. These items are anchored to the Cargo Transport Unit (CTU) and tensioned against the cargo. Another form of lashing used four devices attached to the top of each corner of a container. Lashing products and methods are governed by various authorities such as the Association of American Railroads (AAR) for rail transportation in North America, the international Maritime Organization (IMO) for ocean transportation, and the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) and European Union standard EN12195. Dunnage bags Dunnage bag application in container Whereas strapping and lashing is often used to secure odd-shaped cargo such as machinery, structures, and vehicles. Dunnage bags are mostly used for homogeneous shaped cargo such as food & beverage products, electronics and appliances and roll paper. Often, strapping/lashing and dunnage bags are used in combination to secure chemical products. Dunnage Bags are not approved for rail transportation of hazardous materials in the United States. Dunnage bags, also known as air bags, were introduced some 40 years ago as a convenient, fast and cost effective alternative to secure and stabilize cargo in ISO sea containers, closed rail cars, trucks and (ocean- going) vessels. The purpose of dunnage bags is often misunderstood when they are considered as a void filler only to prevent lateral movement of cargo. When properly applied however, dunnage bags form a 3-dimensional bulkhead of the cargo itself preventing both lateral and longitudinal movement. Dunnage bags rely on the Cargo Transport Unit (CTU) construction, which is to be noted when planning. All cargo movements will therefore stress the construction. Tie downs Chains used on logging truck Heavy loads are sometimes secured to vehicles with tie down straps, heavy duty strapping, or tensioned chains. Heavy objects with round shape like paper rolls can be difficult to secure. Strong woven tarpaulins manufactured to this purpose can then be used. They work in several ways: first of all the ends of the tarpaulin can be used to block the horizontal movement in longitudinal direction as direct spring lashing, secondly the mid part of the tarpaulin work as a top over lashing where the surface pressure caused by tensioning the strapping is evenly distributed over the entire load and thirdly the tarpaulin forms itself according to the cargo form and prohibits horizontal movements of single cargo items.

Her futile and somewhat half-hearted attempt on the King's life became famous and was featured in one of Shelley's first works: Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson, published in 1810. Life Nicholson was born in Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham to a barber called George Nicholson. At the age of 12,Poole, Steve (2000). The politics of regicide in England, 1760‚Äì1850: Troublesome Subjects, Manchester University Press, , p. 70 she was found a place as a maid, and from then worked as a servant in various notable households, including those of Sir John Sebright and Lord Coventry. She showed no sign of mental illness. Before 1783, she was dismissed from her employment after a love affair with a fellow servant, and she seemed to fall on hard times. Her lover left her, and she supported herself through needlework, lodging in a house in Wigmore Street.The Times, Friday, 11 August 1786, p. 3, col. A She was described as \\"below the middle size, and of a very swarthy complexion\\".The Times, Friday, 4 August 1786, p. 3, col. A On 2 August 1786, Nicholson approached the King as he alighted from a carriage at St. James's Palace on the pretext of presenting him with a petition, which was actually a blank piece of paper. As he received the supposed petition, she made two lunges at his chest with an ivory-handled dessert knife before she was brought under control. George, apparently fearing that she would be unjustly handled for such a pitiful attack, was reported as saying \\"The poor creature is mad; do not hurt her, she has not hurt me.\\"Eigen, Joel Peter (2004). \\"Nicholson, Margaret (1750?‚Äì1828)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, retrieved 5 November 2009 (Subscription required)Also reported as: \\"Don't hurt the woman, she is insane\\"; \\"Don't hurt the woman; she is mad; pray take care of her\\"; \\"I am not hurt, take care of that woman\\"; and \\"Secure the woman, I am not hurt\\" (see Poole, p. 71). A search of her lodgings yielded a series of bizarre and clearly delusional letters in which she claimed to be the rightful heir to the throne. The newspapers assumed that Nicholson's insanity was brought on by melancholia over her lover's desertion.Poole, p. 77 She was examined in the chamber of the Board of Green Cloth by Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer William Pitt the Younger, Home Secretary Lord Sydney, Foreign Secretary Lord Carmarthen, Sir Francis Drake, and Mr. Justice Addington. It was discovered that in July she had sent petitions to the King regarding her claim to the throne. In her reply to questions from Addington, she claimed to be a virgin, but also claimed to be the mother of Lords Mansfield and Loughborough, both of whom were older than she was. Her landlord, a stationer called Jonathan Fiske, stated that she was industrious and sober, and earned her living at needlework, making mantuas. She denied wanting to assassinate the King, and said she only intended to scare him. The noted physician Dr John Munro, who was already well known for his testimony in the murder trial of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, certified her insane and she was committed to Bethlem Royal Hospital for life under the Vagrancy Act 1744 on the order of the Home Secretary, Lord Sydney.Andrews, Jonathan (2004). \\"Monro, John (1715‚Äì1791)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, retrieved 5 November 2009.

His calm forbearance and progressive attitude to the insane were praised.Poole, p. 71 He wrote that after \\"the interposition of Providence in the late attempt on my life by a poor insane woman\\" he \\"had every reason to be satisfied with the impression it has awakened in this country\\".George III to Richard Grenville, 29 August 1786, British Library Add.

Rather than use their own names, the book pretended to be poems of Nicholson's own composition \\"edited by her nephew, John FitzVictor\\" and published after her death. In fact, she was still alive and living in Bethlem Hospital. Nicholson's incarceration in Bethlem Hospital was extrajudicial, and George's political opponents depicted it as the act of a tyrant bypassing the rule of law.Poole, p. 78 It was also opposed by hard-line conservatives, who thought it overly generous. However, on the whole it was seen as an act of humane kindness on George's part because a trial for treason was substituted with a hospital placement.Poole, p. 70 In succeeding years, the introduction of \\"not guilty by reason of insanity\\", the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800, and the trial of another insane assailant, James Hadfield, formalised the treatment in Britain of insane persons accused of crimes.

M. 2001., Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. 74, no. 1: 19‚Äì42. The son of a British Consul in Greece, Richard James Wilkinson, was born in 1867 in Salonika (Thessaloniki), Greece. After Felsted School was an undergraduate of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was multilingual and had a command of French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish, and later, Malay and Hokkien which he qualified in, in 1889, while a cadet after joining the Straits Settlements Civil Service. He was an important contributor to the Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Asiatic Society (JMBRAS). On 7 November 1900 Wilkinson presented a collection of Malay manuscripts and printed books to the University of Cambridge Library. He was appointed CMG in 1912.  Career  Straits Settlements Civil Service  Wilkinson arrived in Singapore in 1889 and was appointed Cadet in the Straits Settlements Civil Service. In December 1895, Wilkinson, who was then a District Officer in the Malay States and by then considered well-versed in the native language, joined the Foreign Office. He then rejoined Colonial Civil Service and was the Acting Superintendent of Education at Penang, after which, by the end of March 1897, he became a Police Magistrate at Singapore. By January 1899, Wilkinson was serving as the Acting Inspector of Schools. In April 1907, his book, Malay Beliefs was released. His \\"An Abridged Malay-English Dictionary (Romanised)\\" was released in August 1908. At that time he was serving as Assistant to the Resident of Perak. In 1911 he was Colonial Secretary for the Straits Settlements and an Official member of the Legislative Council. In 1912 he was appointed to the Commission of the Peace (Singapore).  Officer Administrating the S.S. Government  He was appointed the Officer Administering the Government, and Vice Admiral, in June 1914 upon the departure of Governor Sir Arthur Young on leave, and served in those roles until the Governor's return later that year. One of his first acts was to issue, in August, a proclamation informing the citizens of the Straits Settlements that war had \\"broken out between His Majesty King George V and The Emperor of Austria-Hungary and between their respective subjects.\\" Wilkinson's short term as head of the Straits Government was not an easy one, and one of the biggest challenges he had to face was the difficult state of the finances of the Federated Malay States. There was a cash deficit of $30,000,000, although its assets exceeded its liabilities. The bulk of the assets were in the form of securities purchased that could not readily be disposed of. In short, the Federation faced a liquidity or cashflow problem. Projects that had been heavily spent on included the railway line running through the Peninsula to Siam [present-day Thailand], and the construction of the battleship, HMS Malaya. The application by the High Commissioner to the Secretary of State for the Colonies had not yielded any immediate results: the Secretary of State had advised deferring the loan to 1915 owing to the state of the money market in Europe at that time. And with war having broken out, it was not likely for the Federation to be able to secure a loan in 1915 either. The press noted that Wilkinson was \\"a man of exceptional financial capacity, and at the critical moment in Malaya, after the declaration of war,\\" had \\"revealed a grasp of administrative finance, and even of the intricacies of banking, commerce, and exchange which astound men whose whole lives are given to such things.\\" Taking the responsibility on his own shoulders, Wilkinson saved Malaya from, as the papers put it, \\"one of the worst disasters in its history.\\" Wilkinson resolved that the Straits Settlements Government would buy F.M.S. tin at a fixed price, which stabilised the market, and Malaya's finances, at a time when the metal market in London closed down owing to the war. The smelting companies by then had acknowledged that there was a limit to their ability to purchase ore, when there did not appear to be any market to sell to. The Straits Government also decided to make advances to companies against stock, or other securities, averting the fear and anxiety being experienced then. He had employed the resources of the Straits Settlements to preserve the industrial equilibrium of the Federated Malay States. The papers described his position at that time as \\"one of extraordinary delicacy and difficulty for an acting Governor,\\" and noted that if he had not taken on the responsibility of stabilising Malayan industry, \\"there would have been greater disaster than most folk care to acknowledge.\\" F.M.S. had overextended itself, committing to many large projects including the H.M.S. Malaya and the railway line up north, and a bridge connecting Johore and Singapore, and then discovering it could not pay for these. Wilkinson had made their problem, his problem, and fixed it. Despite all of that, he managed to have published by December 1914, a collection of Malay pantun (poetry) that he had worked on together with Richard Olaf Winstedt.  Departure from Singapore  Wilkinson was most loved by the Mohammedan community of Singapore who feted him for days as he was readying to depart Singapore to take up his new role as Governor of Sierra Leone in January 1916. A dinner was thrown by the Moslem Association [of Singapore] on 15 December 1915, at the Victoria Memorial Hall. The guest list read represented almost everyone who mattered in S.S. and F.M.S. administration and commerce. Syed Omar Alsagoff received the guests after which Ali Khan Surati read the English text of the Association's address to Mr. Wilkinson while M. A. Patail read the Malay version. The address, in a decorated silver cylinder mounted on an ebony plinth, was then presented to Wilkinson by Alsagoff. Alsagoff then threw him a garden party at Alsagoff's home at Bukit Tunggal, Thompson Road. The band of the Sultan of Johore had been lent for this occasion. Entertainment included performances of Ronggeng, Mak Yong, Silat, Wayang Kulit, and Indian dance, singing and juggling. Almost a thousand people were present on the grounds. Syed Mohamed Alsagoff read the address in English. It was also read in Malay after which it was presented in a silver casket. By that time Wilkinson had already received several addresses from the Indian Muslim community and those of other nationalities in Singapore.For further details of his career, see Burns [1971: 1J, Winstedt [1947J, Heussler [1981: 132-134J, Roft [1994 [1967J: 130-135J and Gullick [1992: 370-371J.Malay Studies and the British by Russell JonesOne hundred years of Singapore : being some account of the capital of the Straits Settlements from its foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on 6 February 1819 to 6 February 1919 (1921) by Braddell, Roland St. John; Brooke, Gilbert Edward, 1873‚Äì; Makepeace, Walter; published by JOHN MURRAY, 1931  Career summary  * 1896‚Äì1897: Acting Director of Education, Penang * 1897‚Äì1898: Police Magistrate, Singapore * 1898‚Äì1900: Acting Inspector General of Schools in the Straits Settlements, Singapore * 1902‚Äì1903: Transferred to the Dindings, Perak * 1903‚Äì1906: Acting Inspector of Schools for the Federated Malay States * 1906‚Äì1910: Secretary General to the British Resident (Ernest Woodford Birch) in Perak * 1910‚Äì1911: British Resident at Negeri Sembilan * 1911‚Äì1914: Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements * 1914‚Äì1914 Officer Administering the Government of the Straits Settlements * 1914‚Äì1916: Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements * 1916‚Äì1922: Governor, Sierra Leone 9 March 1916 ‚Äì 4 May 1922 Colonies, General: Original Correspondence CO 323/689/19, 1915, National Archives, UKColonies, General: Original Correspondence CO 323/893/7, 1922, National Archives, UK  Cleaning up prostitution in Singapore  31 March 1914: As the Straits Settlements Colonial Secretary at Singapore, Wilkinson called on the Japanese Consul in Singapore, Fujii Minoru to inform him that the government was banishing 37 nationals identified as pimps from the colonies.Japan and Singapore in the world economy: Japan's economic advance into Singapore, 1870‚Äì1965, Volume 5 of Routledge studies in the modern history of Asia by Hiroshi Shimizu, Hitoshi Hirakawa  Legacy   Institutions  He initiated the establishment of the Malay Training College in Malacca in 1900 which was eventually succeeded in 1922 by the Sultan Idris Training College (currently known as the Sultan Idris Education University) at Tanjung Malim, Perak.Ramlah 1991: 19‚Äì23 In 1905 he founded the Malay Residential School, later known as the Malay College at Kuala Kangsar (MCKK) Khasnor 1996: 41-49J  Books authored, edited and compiled  *A vocabulary of central Sakai (dialect of the aboriginal communities in the Gopeng Valley), Printed by J.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon pityoides). It is a shrub, often occurring in dense thickets, with hard bark, silvery-grey new growth, almost cylindrical leaves and spikes of flowers that are usually a shade of yellow. Description Melaleuca pityoides is a shrub growing to high and wide, with hard, grey bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, flat to almost cylindrical in cross section, very narrow elliptic to egg-shaped and end with a sharp point. The leaf veins and oil glands are indistinct. The young leaves and branches are often densely covered with silky hairs. The flowers are a shade of golden-yellow to cream, sometimes tinged with pink or green and are arranged in short spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are in diameter and long with 10 to 15 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 32-52 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from October to February, sometimes in other months and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long.Torrington State Conservation Area Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1883 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, who gave it the name Callistemon pityoides in Australian Chemist and Druggist, based on material gathered from the environs of the Ovens River and \\"Dumaresque River\\". He first mentioned Melaleuca pithyoides without description in 1853 in his First General Report of the Government Botanist on the Vegetation of the Colony in 1853. Mueller had collected non-flowering plant material from Mount Buffalo on an expedition earlier that year. The name was changed to Melaleuca pityoides in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon. The specific epithet (pityoides) is from the Greek pitys meaning ‚Äúpine‚Äù and Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ (e√Ædos) meaning \\"likeness‚Äù, referring to the similarity of the leaves of this species with those of some kinds of pine trees. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs from the Border Ranges district in the far south east of Queensland, south through the Northern, Central and Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and the highlands of eastern Victoria. It grows in swampy heath and rocky streams, often forming thickets to the exclusion of other species. Use in horticulture Melaleuca pityoides is sometimes cultivated (as Callistemon pityoides). It grows well in cold climates, including in the United Kingdom, preferring heavier soils and can tolerate poor drainage.

D.; Schneider, Jason (2011) Have Not Been the Same: The CanRock Renaissance 1985*1995, ECW Press, John Wright also began playing drums with the Victoria punk band The Infamous Scientists, led by vocalist and guitarist Andy Kerr. When The Infamous Scientists disbanded in 1983, and after several months of coercion, Kerr joined Nomeansno. After performing locally and touring, adapting older material for the three-piece lineup, and composing new material, the group entered Mushroom Studio in Vancouver in 1985 to record a new EP. The band recorded four original songs and a cover of \\"Manic Depression\\" by Jimi Hendrix. The sessions were co-produced by Greg Reely, who later produced albums for Sarah McLachlan, Front Line Assembly, Fear Factory, Machine Head, Coldplay, and Skinny Puppy. Release The EP was initially issued on 12\\" vinyl by Undergrowth Records. Nomeansno embarked on extensive touring throughout North America in support of it. They signed with Alternative Tentacles in 1986, who re-issued You Kill Me in on 12\\" vinyl 1991 and later repackaged the EP with Nomeansno's second LP, Sex Mad, as the Sex Mad/You Kill Me compilation CD and cassette. Nomeansno left Alternative Tentacles and began reissuing their back catalogue on their own Wrong Records imprint, with distribution by Southern Records. Neither Sex Mad nor You Kill Me, however, has been reissued by Wrong. Reception You Kill Me was praised retrospectively by critics, typically in the context of its situation beside Sex Mad. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett noted the classic rock influence which contrasts with the band's punk rock influences, praising the cover of \\"Manic Depression.\\" Writing for Trouser Press, critic Ira Robbins praised the EP's dark humor and musical prowess.

They commonly claim to belong to the Kshatriya caste. According to historians like S.L.Barua, Kalitas started migrating from North and East India to Assam during the 11th century rule of Dharmapal.A Comprehensive History of Assam by S.L.Barua, page 15 Origin According to the \\"Purana Tradition\\", the Kalitas are considered as pure Aryans. Though the Aryan descent theories endorse the arrival of the Kalitas \\"before the rise of the existing professional castes\\", the Kalitas generally claim to belong to the Kshatriya caste, and call themselves kulalupta, kula meaning caste and lupta meaning gone (\\"lost caste\\") in the context of the legend that the Kalitas \\"were Ksatriyas who fled from the wrath of Parasurama who was determined to exterminate the Ksatriyas. But this seems to be a false etymology.\\" The Kalitas in Assam are considered next only to the Brahmins in the caste-hierarchy. According to the legends, they are \\"the non-Vedic Aryans\\" who are responsible for bringing Aryan culture to Assam. Having mingled with local population, they still preserve certain elements of Aryan culture even after localising their culture to some extent. B.S. Guha has found similarities between some surnames of \\"Alpine Nagar Brahmins\\" of Gujarat with those of North East India, as referred in the Nidhanpur land grants of Kamarupa King Bhaskaravarman (6th century A.D.) such as Datta, Dhara, Deva, Nandi, Sena, and Vasu, etc. and connects them with the Kalitas of Assam.The great Indian corridor in the east by Phani Deka Again, historian Kanaklal Barua mentions these surnames while referring to the Nidhanpur inscription and says that these surnames \\"now belong almost exclusively to the Bengali Kayasthas\\". Few scholars including K.R. Medhi, K.L. Barua, P.C. Choudhuri, M. Neog, B. K. Kakati made speculations by drawing the references of Greek records, words like Kakatiai, Kalaiai, Kaltis, Koudontai, Kudutai, Gurucharitis and few early religious literatures to establish the Kalitas through materials not based on ethnology or anthropology. Some even tried to relate Kalitas to Naraka-Bhagadatta, who were essentially of Tibeto-Burmese origin. Social life Mirroring the history of Assam, the Kalitas were spiritual gurus of Kochs. According to Allen, All the hinduized people except Brahmins were Kalita. Kalitas were also peasants, though during the rule of the Ahom dynasty they also proved their might and capabilities as soldiers, generals, administrators, envoys, and judges. The Ahom paik system surnames of Bora, Hazarika, Saikia, Kakoti, Borkakoty, Barua, Rajkhowa, and Phukan can all be found amongst the Kalitas of Assam, which signify that they served the Ahom monarchy. Bora was the leader of 20 paiks (or foot soldiers), Saikia that of 100 paiks and Hazarika that of 1000 paiks. The Baruas led 3000 men, similar to the Rajkhowas. Phukans formed the uppermost layers of the Ahom military and judicio-administrative structure, subservient to the Ahom Borphukans and Borbaruas.A History of Assam by Sir Edward Gait, page 248‚Äì250 .Certain posts like \\"Boiragi\\" or envoys to neighbouring kingdoms such as the Jaintias (presently in Meghalaya), the Kacharis (Assam), and the Mughal Sultanate in Bengal, were given to Kalitas in preference to Ahoms.A History of Assam by Sir Edward Gait, page 124 Demand of reservation Since 1988, the Kalita community has been demanding Scheduled Tribe status. After six tribal groups were granted ST status by the government in 2018 barring the Kalitas, the latter threatened agitation. All Assam Kalita Janogosthi Student Union (AAKJSU) has demanded 50% reservation in government sector jobs and demanded reservation of 25 MLA seats in Assam, 3 in Lok Sabha and 2 in Rajya Sabha seats from Assam. They also demanded the formation of a Kalita Development Council and the Pagjyotishpur Autonomous Council.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue use the name Callistemon pungens.) It is a distinctive shrub with stiff branches, silvery new growth, prickly leaves and spikes of purple flowers in late spring. It is classified as a vulnerable species under the Australian Government Endangered Species Protection Act. Description Melaleuca williamsii is a shrub growing to tall with rigid branches and new growth covered with soft, silky hairs giving a silvery appearance. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, narrow elliptic to narrow egg-shaped and flat to half-moon shaped in cross section. They have a sharp tip long, a mid vein, indistinct lateral veins and oil glands visible on both surfaces. The flowers are deep red, white, or a shade of pink to purple. They are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to in diameter and long with 10 to 65 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 25 to 66 stamens per flower. Flowering occurs from October to December and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long. Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid M. williamsii subsp. williamsii habit M. williamsii subsp. williamsii mature fruits Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca williamsii was first named in 2009 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when Callistemon pungens was transferred to the present genus. It had previously been known as Callistemon pungens, first formally described by Roger Spencer and Peter Lumley in 1990 in Muelleria, based on plant material collected from near Hillgrove. The specific epithet (williamsii) honours John Beaumont Williams, a botanist who was expert in the flora of the Northern Tablelands region of New South Wales. There are three subspecies: *Melaleuca williamsii subsp. fletcheri which has stamens up to long, flower spikes wide, pink or mauve stamens and occurs in the Stanthorpe district in Queensland; *Melaleuca williamsii subsp. synoriensis which has stamens up to long, flower spikes wide and occurs in the Gibraltar Range and Point Lookout districts in New South Wales; *Melaleuca williamsii subsp. williamsii which has stamens up to long, flower spikes wide, red, crimson or purple stamens and occurs in the Northern Tablelands region of New South Wales. Callistemon pungens is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca williamsii by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the higher altitude regions of north eastern New South Wales and south eastern Queensland. It grows in granite and trachyte rock crevices in forest and heath and on sandy or shallow rocky soil. Conservation Melaleuca williamsii (as Callistemon pungens) has been classified as \\"vulnerable\\" by the Scientific Committee of the NSW Government Department of Environment and Heritage and by the Australian Government Department of the Environment.

Since its creation in 1996, it promotes technological innovation for human benefit. Its action focuses on an international scientific competition with a new theme every year, rewarding leaders of innovative technology-oriented projects.  Health Awards  Brain-powered remote control for paralyzed people The Brain-Computer Interface system of Professor Jonathan Wolpaw aims to facilitate the communication of patients with locked-in syndrome. It enables patients to move a cursor on a computer screen, dictate a text or control a robotic arm.NY State Department of Health , June 2005 Artificial retina The artificial retina of Professor Jos√© Sahel and his team at the Quinze-Vingts National Ophthalmology Hospital Centre aims to allow people with degenerative retinal disease, numbering 1.5 million in 2008, to accomplish everyday activities. Placed under the existing retina, it directly stimulates the neurons, replacing defective cells. These implants should eventually allow patients to recognize faces, read large print and move independently in a restricted environment. The challenge for the Altran teams was to find solutions to produce artificial retina in series, in order to bring solutions to the widest number of patients. Press Release on the Artificial Retina, October 2nd 2007 Pain-treatment based on cell micro-encapsulation In 1998, the Altran Foundation prize was awarded to the Toulouse-Rangueil University laboratory, and to the Kappa Biotech company http://www.pharmaxie.com/Kappa,biotech- Laboratoire-num-707.html for their pain-treatment project based on cell micro- encapsulation.Altran c'est nous !, 1998 : Pain and physical handicap, January 30th 2006 The micro-encapsulation process stops the organism from rejecting these cells by protecting them in a sphere, thus preventing the immune system from recognizing them. The process involves creating biocompatible micro- membranes which are implanted using in-vitro fertilization technology. Until recently, the implantation posed a number of productivity problems, as it was taking 15 minutes for one micro-membrane to be implanted. Altran teams stepped in to help solve this problem. Their studies demonstrated that the automated implantation option, using a laser optical guidance system, was the most promising approach. With the cooperation of Tarbes E.N.I. students, Altran consultants developed a robot to automate the microcapsule filling operation using a dual-needle system. The robot is now commercialized. Test patch for child food allergies The team from DBV Technologieshttp://www.dbv- technologies.com/ has developed a patented innovative process, the E-patch, which is used to determine allergies of children. The ready-to-use standardised patch tests are highly reliable and conserve the allergic agents in their best state of allergy. This innovative technique uses the principal of freeze drying and electrification to retain the allergic agents on the patch, without using solvent or glue. The E-patch is then conditioned so that it remains air and water tight. Once applied to the child the allergic agents are rapidly hydrated by body transpiration and liberated from the patch. They enter into contact with the skin and create, if positive, a reaction which can be seen by the doctor 48 hours later.History of DBV Technologies , 2007 Environmental awards Economic solar panel The MAXXUN project was to develop a system of disruptive solar cells based on the luminescent solar concentrating (LSC) technology, in order to lower the investment for a solar energy system by more than half. Altran Technologies consultants have worked during a year with the award-winning team to increase the surface area of the panel from 2.5 cm¬≤ to 10 cm¬≤; to apply an absorbing and dispersing layer on this extra surface area; to optimize light power under different conditions; to build a demonstration model and to identify potential partners.John M. Grohol, Psych Central, February 21st 2009 Ecologic system of soil decontamination The Altran Foundation jury awarded the first prize 2001 to Julien Troquet, a young research engineer and founder of the start-up company Biobasic Environnement. His project consists in developing a decontamination process for soil using bioremediation. This process allows for a complete decontamination using a gentle \\"alternative\\" method, so the excavation of the site is not necessary and the ecosystem is preserved. It is five times less expensive than competing techniques and can also be used on many different types of pollution.Centrale Sant√© , 2007 Laser restoration of historical monuments The companies Jaulardhttp://jaulard.com/ and Trivella (companies from France and Italy respectively), together with the laser specialists Quantelhttp://www.quantel.fr/en/ (France) and Unilaser (from France and Portugal) have developed the LAMA project of a laser that can be carried by hand and used to clean the facades and sculpted ornaments of historical monuments. The process makes it easier to select the area to be cleaned without damaging \\"the outer skin\\" of the stone and outperforms all other existing systems at a fifth of the cost.European Commission Research, 1997  International Solidarity Awards  Desalination of sea water Work by Viviane Renaudin has led to the development of a new type of multiple-effect plate evaporator, which can be used for the desalination of brackish or sea water. The proposed distillation process is based on the principle of multiple-effect dripping film plate evaporators. The innovation lies in the horizontal transfer of vapour to the condensation zone. From a socio-economic point of view, thanks to its human-scale dimensions, its modular construction and its ease of assembly, the system has the advantage of being usable by unskilled operators in developing countries. The process also has political value: it enables countries to end their dependence on their neighbours for their drinking water supplies.JL Martin-Lagardette, Water and Wastes digest, 2009 New generation fuel The aim of Guy Reinaud's project is to reply to the needs, in renewable domestic energy, of a population of 2 billion individuals living in the tropical regions of Africa, Latin America and Asia, and at the same time fighting against deforestation and climatic changes. The proposed solution is biomass charcoal as a source of renewable energy - patented and developed by Pro-Natura International. Biomass charcoal produces domestic energy from non-upgraded biomass, other than wood, in particular agricultural residues non-consumed by animals. By reducing the dependence on wood, biomass charcoal protects forests and as a consequence fights against desertification. Moreover, the energy produced by biomass charcoal is equal to that of wood charcoal for a sales price per kilo 50% cheaper.Pro-Natura International Green Charcoal , last updated January 2009 Science Awards Detection of cosmic particles HiSPARC,http://www.hisparc.nl/ a Dutch university research Institute, is proposing to challenge teams of secondary school pupils and teachers with the study of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. HiSPARC wants to make young people discover and \\"experience the sciences\\" by creating a teaching network of teams of pupil-researchers. Liaising closely with academic and scientific institutions, these groups will work on the design, control and operation of particular items of detection equipment. The retrieval of the data obtained and its analysis will then be the subject of interpretation.J.W Van Holten HISPARC A view from the bottom, February 28th 2005 Food tracing systems The first prize went to Dominique Gr√©goire from the company TechniGREG who developed new tracing systems: TraciLOG and TraciMEAL. This improved monitoring of the cold chain is a major step forward as far as consumer safety is concerned. The principle is to endow each mobile container with \\"electronic intelligence\\", thus enabling it to log each of the phases through which it passes, monitor its internal temperature and record information about whether its doors are open or closed. This information is gathered automatically and securely, without any contact with the contents, and requires no human intervention. It is a reliable global management indicator for use by the logistics service in charge of maintaining the cold chain. Altran engineers worked side by side with the prize-winner, on conducting market studies, on the choice of suppliers, at developing product packaging, on the design of an electronic module and on the transition to the production stage for both TraciLOG and TraciMEAL.TechniGREG Awards , 2001 After the support, TechniGREG increased its capital of more than 1 million euros. The efforts of these teams were rewarded in March 2001, when a fully operational version of TraciLOG was installed for the first time by a supermarket distributor. TraciMEAL was adopted last May by an institutional food service provider in Toulouse. Since then, TechniGREG, which has registered many patents related to this innovation, has come into business with many companies, particularly in the air transport sector.

Demographics According to the 2001 Census, Talhan has a population of 2,946 people. The village has . Baba Shaheed Nihal Singh Talhan is famous for its Shaheedi Jor mela, which is held annually in the memory of Shaheed Baba Nihal Singh. The mela is a big attraction in Jalandhar. The 58th Jor Mela was held on 20‚Äì21 June 2009. Baba Nihal Singh belonged to the neighbouring village of Dakoha. Baba Nihal Singh made pulleys for drinking water wells. He served the people by installing the pulleys at the base of the well. Local people believe that as the Baba was divine, no matter which water well Baba installed a pulley, the water wells never dried up and the water remained sweet. On one occasion, the Baba met with a fatal accident, whilst installing a pulley and the Baba became a martyr whilst serving the people. The people of Talhan constructed a shrine (Samadh) in Talhan. The shrine was looked after by the Baba Nihal Singh's associate, Harnam Singh. After Harnam Singh's death, the followers cremated him next to the Baba's Samadhi. The two shrines have now become a grand Gurudwara. An annual Mela is held to mark the death anniversary (\\"Barsi\\") of the Baba. This Mela is a grand event in Jalandhar. There are sports events like Kabbadi, volleyball and tug-of-war. Gatka(Sikh martial arts) displays are held. Religion Talhan has a mixed population of Sikhs and Hindus. The village also has one Muslim family whose Iqbal Bibi is the sole caretaker of the \\"mazaar\\" (dargah) of Pir Baba Fateh Shah Qadir. The \\"mazaar\\" is located in the north-west of Talhan and is about a kilometre from Gurdwara Shaheed Baba Nihal Singh. The \\"mazaar\\" includes three graves, a \\"tomb\\" and the care taker is Baba Paramjit Singh Bains. The village participates in the annual urs or Mela where Qawwali's and folk singers perform.Chandigarh Tribune.There is an annual Mela which is celebrated by Sehgal's. This Mela is celebrated at their holy place known as the Jathere of Sehgal family. Talhan caste conflict The Talhan conflict is a very important event in the assertion of dalit rights in Punjab. 60% of the population is from the scheduled caste and are mainly from the Chamar caste. In June 2003, Talhan hit the headlines in when a forceful assertion of the majority dalit community of Chamars took on members of the Jat community; they wanted a share on the governing committee of the Shaheed Baba Nihal Singh Gurdwara. Though the Chamar community form more than 60 percent of Talhan's 3,000-strong population, they were denied a share in the committee. As a result of a protracted dispute between the villagers, members of the dalit and other communities engage in running all aspects of the village administration . General Neighbouring villages include Parasrampur, Kotli Than Singh, Bhakriana, Semmi, Salempur Masanda, Dhanowali, Dakoha, Dhilwan and Puranpur. The village has many castes with surnames such as Jassi , Bains, Sander, Bhogal, Sandhu ,Chahal, Bal and Randhawa. The Bains families are divided into two \\"pattis\\" (family divisions): Burha Magu and Rurha Deepa and claim ancestry from Baba Tula who was originally from either Baria village or Bahowal village near Mahilpur.

D.; Schneider, Jason (2011) Have Not Been the Same: The CanRock Renaissance 1985*1995, ECW Press, They conclude that the EP showcases \\"the total commitment to honesty that quickly earned them the respect of the wider punk community. For Trouser Press, Robbins called the EP a \\"statement of purpose\\". A critic writing for Maximumrocknroll described the EP as containing \\"4 great songs\\".Maximumrocknroll, Issue 113, 1992 The tracks were described by Allmusic's Laurie Mercer as \\"relatively straightforward\\", but Mercer also commented on \\"Forget Your Life\\"'s contrast between apparently nihilistic lyrics and positive and upbeat sentiment.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the names Callistemon sieberi or Callistemon paludosus.) It is a shrub or small tree with flexible, often drooping branches, pinkish new growth and spikes of cream, pale yellow, or sometimes pink flowers in summer. Description Melaleuca paludicola is a shrub or tree growing to tall, with fibrous bark, or hard, fissured bark on older plants. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, flat, linear to narrow lance-shaped and have a small point at the end. There is a distinct mid-vein and 11‚Äì18 indistinct side veins. The flowers are a shade of cream to yellow, occasionally pink and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are in diameter with 10 to 40 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 48‚Äì67 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs mainly from October to January and is followed by fruit which are woody, cup-shaped capsules, long.M. paludicola in the Gibraltar Range National Park Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca paludicola was named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when he transferred Callistemon sieberi to the present genus. Callistemon sieberi was first formally described by botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1828 in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. The specific epithet (paludicola) is from the Latin word palus meaning ‚Äúswamp‚Äù, \\"marsh\\", \\"bog\\" or \\"fen\\" and the suffix -cola meaning ‚Äúinhabitant‚Äù. An earlier, alternative name (taxonomic synonym) for the species was Callistemon paludosus and the present name was chosen to link with the earlier one. Callistemon paludosus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca paludicola by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca paludicola occurs from Warwick in the far south east of Queensland, through New South Wales as far inland as the eastern part of the North West Plains to the eastern half of Victoria. There is a disjunct population in the Mount Lofty Ranges and Adelaide districts of South Australia. It grows in and near rivers, in dry, rocky riverbeds and in flood channels subject to periodic inundation. Use in horticulture Melaleuca paludicola is sometimes cultivated as Callistemon sieberi. An alpine form is a smaller, denser, rounded shrub suitable as a more formal plant.

He was born in St. John's, the son of John Renouf and Johanna Little. He worked in the family business for a time, later opening a private academy in St. John's. In the 1869 general election, running as an Anti-Confederate, Renouf was elected in both St. John's and Placentia and St. Mary's, later choosing to sit for the latter district. He served in the Executive Council as surveyor general and chairman of the Board of Works. In 1873, he resigned his seat in the assembly after he was named a judge in the Central District court. Renouf also served as major in the St. John's Volunteer Rifles.

It was built between 1963 and 1966 and belongs to the Harzwasserwerke. Its purposes are the supply of drinking water, flood protection, water flow regulation and hydroelectric power generation. The average annual discharge through the Innerste Dam is 60 million m¬≥.  Structures  The Innerste is an earth-fill dam with multiple, external, asphaltic concrete layers. It has an inspection gangway along its whole length on the upstream apron. In front of the upstream base of the dam is a shaft spillway (a flood overflow tower), into which also the bottom outlet is integrated. The water of the Innerste Dam can be pumped via a 4.6 km long diversion channel to the Grane Dam further east, where it can be used for water treatment. From 2003 to 2005 the reservoir was completely emptied and renovated, especially the asphalt sealing and the bottom outlet. This work was finished in September 2005.  Flood control  Because the reservoir only has a limited flood control capacity (i.e. its capacity is relatively small in relation to the annual discharge), it can only check flooding within certain limits. The flood relief facility (spillway) is used about every two years. Nevertheless, even when the Innerste Dam overflows, the level of retention significantly reduces and delays flooding.  Recreation  The reservoir may be used by sailing and rowing boats and for angling and camping. The Innerste Valley Railway is an old railway line, that had a halt by the Innerste Dam.
