Research Davis is well known for identifying the first T-cell receptor genes, which are responsible for T lymphocytes ability to \\"see\\" foreign entities, solving a major mystery in immunology at that time. He and his research group have made many subsequent discoveries about this type of molecule, subsequently, specifically concerning its biochemical properties and other characteristics, including the demonstration that T cells are able to detect and respond to even a single molecule of their ligand-fragments of antigens bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex cell surface molecules. He also developed a novel way of labeling specific T lymphocytes according to the molecules that they recognize, and this procedure is now an important method in many clinical and basic studies of T cell activity, from new vaccines against cancer to identifying \\"rogue\\" T cells in autoimmunity. In recent years his has increasingly focused on understanding the human immune system, from developing broad systems biology approaches to inventing new methods to help unravel the complexities of T cell responses to cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases.

Events On December 21, 2015, firemen were called to a fire in a house in Rupperswil, a community with about 5,000 inhabitants in the Canton of Aargau, Switzerland. Four bodies were located at the site, and soon it became clear that the four people had been killed before the fire broke out. A five months long investigation finally concluded on May 12, 2016 when the suspect was apprehended in the nearby town of Aarau. The victims were Carla S., 48 years old, her two sons Davin (13) and Dion (19) and Dion's girlfriend, Simona F. (21). The murderer, Thomas N. a 33-year-old student, entered the family's house after the mother's partner left. By threatening Davin, he made his mother tie up Dion and Simona, and demanded money. After the mother returned from the bank, he sexually abused the younger child, and then killed the victims by slashing their throats. After setting fire to the house, he left. The police of the Canton of Aargau offered a previously unheard-of sum of 100,000 Swiss Francs - as a reward for information. For five months, the killer remained elusive, but he was finally apprehended after a thorough investigation. Traces of his DNA as well as his fingerprints have been identified at the crime location, and he has laid down a comprehensive confession. He lived with his mother in the same town, was known for owning two Huskies, and spent much time training and coordinating the football youth in his area. He did not know the victims beforehand and may have sought them out because the family had a 13-year-old son. When he was apprehended, the police found cable ties, adhesive tape, an old Swiss army ordnance pistol (Pistole 1900/06/29, a version of the Luger pistol) as well as prepared handcuffs made from rope. These were interpreted as a sign that he planned future crimes of a similar nature.

The group was responsible for the October 1782 Long Beach Island Massacre, which occurred after hostilities between the United States and Great Britain had been put on hold pending treaty negotiations. He and his band were relentlessly pursued thereafter. Bacon was killed the following March while resisting capture (considered by several historians to be the last casualty of the war). Early life John Bacon's origins are not known. He first appeared in public documents in 1775 as a shingler in Monmouth County, Province of New Jersey required to appear in local court for unpaid debts.Fowler, David J. Egregious Villains, Wood Rangers, and London Traders: The Pine Robber Phenomenon in New Jersey During the Revolutionary War New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rutgers University Press, 1987, pages 235-292 Bacon was married and had two sons who resided with him in Pemberton, New Jersey. The Pine Robbers William Franklin, the royal governor of the New Jersey colony, helped organize associator military units‚Äîincluding Bacon's Refugees Bacon purportedly served at one point in the Patriot militia, but subsequently joined with the Loyalist side. He became a member of the \\"Board of Associated Loyalists\\" an organization of associators, which was chartered by King George III and overseen by William Franklin, British royal governor of the New Jersey Colony (and son of Benjamin Franklin). Franklin chose Bacon as the military leader of the \\"Pine Robbers\\" (which later became known as \\"The Refugees\\"), a guerrilla-style fighting unit which financed its operations through war-time plunder. The organization's purpose was to conduct raids and to seize supplies from the Patriots.South Jersey:A History, 1664-1924. Volume 1, page 238 Bacon readily fulfilled the organization's mission by raiding ground transports, depots, ships, and Patriot homes (including those belonging to members of the Monmouth Militia). Bacon and his band of marauders were involved in the October 1782 Long Beach Island Massacre, and the following December were in a skirmish at the Cedar Bridge Tavern in New Jersey. Bacon's subsequent death several months after this engagement is often characterized as the last casualty of the American Revolutionary War.Peckham, Howard H.

University of Chicago Press, 1974, page 99 =A skirmish at Manahawkin= Manahawkin, New Jersey militiamen had heard rumors that Bacon and his men, now known as \\"The Refugees,\\" were planning to raid the town. The local militia met on December 30, 1781 at Capitan Reuben Randolph's home to plan the town's defense. On the morning of December 31, Bacon and his men, totaling between 30 and 40, arrived from the direction of Barnegat Township. Before the militiamen were fully organized, Bacon and his men opened fire, killing Lines Pangbon and wounding Sylvester Tilton.Salter, Edward; Centennial History of Ocean County; Toms River, New Jersey; (1878); p. 24Revolutionary War Sites in Manahawkin, New Jersey; Revolutionary War New Jersey website; accessed May 14, 2016 =Long Beach Island Massacre= On October 25, 1782, Bacon conspired with a Loyalist sympathizer who was working on the offloading of cargo from a cutter which had become stranded at Barnegat Shoals, to hijack the operation. He and his band stealthily murdered 19 men in their sleep, including Militia Captain Andrew Steelman. This attack, occurring after formal hostilities between the United States and Great Britain had paused because of peace negotiations, was considered so atrocious that Governor William Livingston put a bounty of fifty pounds on Bacon's head.The Long Beach Island Massacre 25 October 1782; The American War of Independence - at Sea website; accessed May 14, 2016Pirates of New Jersey: Plunder and High Adventure on the Garden State Coastline; Donnelly, Mark and Diehl, Daniel; publisher unknown; (2010); pp. 79-80 =Affair at Cedar Bridge= A gun battle involving Bacon and his men near the Cedar Bridge Tavern, on the Jersey Shore, was the last documented conflict of the American Revolutionary War.

They came upon Bacon and his men as they were camped out near a tavern overlooking the Cedar Bridge crossing. The Refugees fired upon Shreve and his men as they approached Cedar Bridge, wounding him and three others. Bacon was wounded along with four of his fighters, but he escaped.

Using dishonesty and blackmail, she ruined some of her lovers. She was sentenced 15 years' penal servitude for having one of her lovers blinded. Biography Born Eug√©nie Arm√©na√Øde Br√©court on 8 April 1837 in Paris, she was the daughter of a printer and a vegetable seller. As a child she was neglected, and at 5 years old was adopted by a Baroness. When Br√©court was 11, her parents took her away from the Baroness and used her the sell gingerbread on the streets. When she was 17 she returned to the Baroness, who agreed to take her in and found her work in a silk factory. When Br√©court was 18 she attended the wedding of a co-worker. On returning home she express her desire to get married. The Baroness didn't take her seriously and when Gras, the grocer, called to make his delivery, jokingly suggested him for a husband. Br√©court took the idea seriously and in 1855 the couple were married. The Baroness reluctantly gave her consent and provided a dowry of 12,000 francs, which the couple used to open a grocery store. The marriage didn't last long. Br√©court was very demanding and after a while Gras left. Br√©court went back to the Baroness for a while and then disappeared. She is reputed to have started a relationship with an officer of the garrison at Vincennes. Courtesan Some while later Br√©court reappeared as a courtesan, calling herself Jeanne de la Cour, having unsuccessfully attempted commerce, acting, literature and journalism. Br√©court regarded men as playthings, to be discarded when they had served their purpose. She wrote: One of her lovers, a German, committed suicide, another took an overdose of cantharides. A third died in hospital. Br√©court was unmoved by their deaths, however her actions ended with her being admitted to an asylum. A few months later she was released as \\"cured\\". From the asylum she went to Vittel, where she assumed the title of Baroness. When Br√©court was in her late 30s, her hair was greying and her looks fading. Her lovers were deserting her because of her blackmailing them, others looking for younger women. Gras died in a charity hospital, and now free from her past and to safeguard her future, she set off to find a permanent benefactor. Rene de la Roche In 1873 Br√©court met Rene de la Roche at a ball in Paris. Roche was a wealthy 20-year-old who became infatuated by her, and by the end of that year they entered into a relationship. Roche was referred to in some reports as Georges de Saint Pierre to protect his anonymity. Three years later Roche left for six months in Egypt. Br√©court met an ageing courtesan with a younger blind lover who was devoted to her and could not see the effects of age on her. The concept appealed to Br√©court, and on Roche's returned from Egypt in 1876 she hatched a plot to blind him. Nathalis Gaudry had been a childhood friend of Br√©court and they had been reunited when he moved to Paris looking for employment after being in the army. She convinced Gaudry, to blind the Roche, telling Gaudry that Roche was the son of a man who had cheated her. Gaudry eventually carried out her wishes to blind Roche on 13 January 1877. Br√©court and Gaudry were brought to trial for this in July 1877, and Br√©court was defended by Charles Lachaud, who had earlier defended Marie Lafarge. Br√©court was found guilty, and was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude, while Gaudry, who had been found guilty with extenuating circumstances, was sentenced to five years in prison.

The ship was electrically lighted throughout with some electrical auxiliaries including one steering engine, another being steam driven as were the cargo working winches. As built the ship had accommodation for 202 first class passengers in 107 cabins and four suites, 128 second class passengers in 49 cabins, 46 third class passengers in 16 cabins and 42 fourth class passengers. First class passengers had access to a deck saloon, a verandah cafe, smoking room, nursery, gymnasium, photographic dark room and a 138-seat dining saloon. The crew was 161. Navigation and safety equipment included wireless and submarine signals (bells)Lloyd's Register notes the presence of submarine signal capability with the abbreviation \\"sub.sig.\\" under the ship's name. An early description of the system is given at \\"How Underwater Signals Operate\\" (The Marine Review, February 1920). and fourteen boats, two powered, sufficient for all persons aboard. The ship was named after Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587‚Äì1629)  Early career  = Sea trials = After being completed in June 1915, Jan Pieterszoon Coen became the new flagship of the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland and was also the largest ship ever to be built in the Netherlands at the time. She completed her sea trials in IJmuiden in June 1915 with several passengers aboard, including the company's president J.B.A Jonckheer, four ministers with their spouses, the Mayor of Amsterdam with his spouse and two law enforcers. There were also a high number of officials, important business relation officials and the supervisory boards and the boards of shipyard and shipping company of the SMN. The ship's Master at the time was Captain H.G.J Uylkens who led the ship to open seas together with the tugboat Cycloop van Zurm√ºlen. The ship sailed South past Zandvoort, Katwijk, Noordwijk and Scheveningen. During lunch however, a submarine was spotted by the guests and crew. Everyone became worried at first, but it was soon clear that it was a Dutch submarine that was given orders to guide Jan Pieterszoon Coen back to IJmuiden. The ship completed her sea trials and arrived back in IJmuiden without incident. = Active service = SS Jan Pieterszoon Coen docked in Batavia ca. 1937 On 11 September 1915 at 3PM, Jan Pieterszoon Coen left Amsterdam, Netherlands for her maiden voyage to Batavia. She sailed through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal to reach her destination. SS Jan Pieterszoon Coen left Amsterdam for Batavia again on 1 Januari 1916, but this time she would sail around Cape of Good Hope and Cape Town to reach Batavia. She would arrive on 17 February 1916 before returning to the Netherlands, where she arrived on 6 May. After the war, the ship would continue to sail the Amsterdam ‚Äì Batavia route.  Later service and end  Jan Pieterszoon Coen left Batavia for the last time on 28 June 1939 and was stationed in Amsterdam on 29 July 1939 where she was waiting to be scrapped. However, due to the outbreak of the Second World War, the ship was needed again and she made two short voyages to Lisbon, Portugal, in order to retrieve passengers from the MS Oranje. When the German Army invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, the Royal Netherlands Navy made a plan which involved scuttling Jan Pieterszoon Coen at the entrance of the port of IJmuiden in order to prevent German warships entering the harbor. The plan was set in motion in the night of 14 May 1940, Captain R. van Rees Vellinga sailed Jan Pieterszoon Coen from Amsterdam to IJmuiden. Once there, the ship was supposed to be escorted to the harbor entrance by two tugboats, but they were accidentally sunk too early. As a solution to the problem, The Royal Netherlands Navy ordered the tugboat Atjeh and a minesweeper to tow the ship into place. The tugboat and minesweeper towed the ship into place with much difficulty due to the tide change. The ship was positioned with the bow to the Southern pier and the stern to the Northern pier of the port entrance. The explosives which were previously installed on the ship were detonated and the ship sank between the piers. Her upper decks were still sticking out of the water due to the shallow depths. The plan was successful and the ship prohibited German ships to enter the harbor, the Netherlands however surrendered to the Axis powers and was occupied by Nazi-Germany. Modern day view of the port entrance of IJmuiden, the piers are clearly visible on the left  Wreck  The German Army emptied the ship of movable property during 1940, they could do this because the ship was mostly above water. Rijkswaterstaat was thinking of salvaging Jan Pieterszoon Coen, since the ship was mostly intact and in shallow waters. But due to a series of storms, the ship sank deeper into the sand. In 1941, a 50-meter portion of the stern was removed so big ships could sail into the harbor again. During the remainder of the war, Jan Pieterszoon Coen sank deeper into the sea and her upper decks were severely damaged and deteriorated by the strong waves that constantly pounded the ship. The funnels and some decks had also collapsed during this period. After the war in May and June 1945, the Royal Netherlands Navy with help from the Royal Navy, destroyed what was left of the ship with depth charges. However, a lot of debris was left in the entrance and the Dutch government was forced to clean up the debris from the bottom of the sea in 1968 so bigger ships could sail into the harbor without problems.

During the American Revolutionary War she served at Gibraltar during the Great Siege. In 1796 she was converted to a brig. Although she did capture two French privateers and participate in an incident in which the Royal Navy violated Swedish neutrality, her service in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars was apparently relatively uneventful. A storm in February 1807 destroyed her with the loss of her entire crew. American Revolutionary War Lieutenant John Gibson commissioned Speedwell in July 1780, for the Mediterranean. She arrived at Gibraltar, which was undergoing the Great Siege, on 20 December, carrying dispatches. While Speedwell was on her way she encountered a small vessel that launched an attack that Speedwell repulsed, though Gibson sustained some wounds. On 1 January 1781 the British took possession of an abandoned settee on which there were letters, with one mentioning that the vessel that had attacked Speedwell had suffered several men killed and wounded. Speedwell then remained at Gibraltar. Five men deserted Speedwell on 11 April after helping tow the cutter Tartar out of the Mole. On 16 June 1781 Speedwell brought 120 prisoners into Gibraltar, but it is not clear from where. On 5 October some of Speedwells crew intended a mutiny to seize her and desert with her to the Spanish. However, a Spanish boy, a deserter, who was on board informed Gibson, who arrested four ringleaders. The deserters were then placed in irons on the provost ship. About half the crew were amenable to the planned mutiny, which had the mutineers rising, killing the officers, and then sailing Speedwell to Algerciras. There the mutineers intended to sell her, split the proceeds, and proceed individually to England. On 3 December a crewman from Speedwell stole a fishing boat and made for the Spanish shore before some fishermen set out after him and brought him back. Speedwell was re-rated as a sloop-of-war on 22 March 1782, with the news reaching Gibraltar on 22 May. On 16‚Äì17 September Speedwell prepared to go to sea. In June 1782 the garrison launched 12 gunboats. Each was armed with an 18-pounder gun, and received a crew of 21 men drawn from Royal Navy vessels stationed at Gibraltar. Speedwell provided the crew for Vengeance. On 11 July four men deserted, two of them from Speedwell, and participants in the planned mutiny. During the siege, Speedwell provided men for the Marine Brigade formed on 9 September 1782. Messrs Malone, Devereux, and Park served as captain and ensigns in the brigade, respectively. Around 11 October, a storm came up and drove the Spanish two-decker San Miguel close to Gibraltar, apparently in some distress. The batteries fired on her, killing two men and wounding two others. She shortly thereafter grounded, and struck. A boat from Speedwell went out to establish possession. San Miguel, of 72 guns, had a complement of 634 men under the command of Don Juan Moreno. She was a new vessel, built at Havana. Earlier, on 13 and 14 September, the garrison destroyed a number of floating batteries. In December 1784 there was a distribution of ¬£30,000 in bounty money for the batteries and the proceeds of the sale of ships' stores, including those of San Miguel. A second payment of ¬£16,000 followed in November 1785. A third payment, this of ¬£8,000 pounds, followed in August 1786. June 1788 saw the payment of a fourth tranche, this of ¬£4,000. Speedwells officers and crew shared in all four. Commander William Bradshaw was appointed to command Speedwell in January 1783. It is not clear from where Speedwell came, nor when, but on 19 March 1783 she anchored in Rosia Bay. Three days later she and sailed for Barbary. She returned, and on 27 May set out from Gibraltar to attempt to sail west. On 6 June Speedwell and sailed for Tangier. On 9 August Speedwell departed. She arrived at Portsmouth on 5 September.Lloyd's List, no.1497. Post-war Speedwell was paid off in August 1783. Then on 14 October she reverted to the status of a cutter. She underwent fitting at Portsmouth, and in November Lieutenant Richard Willis recommissioned her for service off the Isle of Arran. In July 1787 she was paid-off. Lieutenant Thomas Rayment recommissioned Speedwell in June 1789. In August, King George, with Queen Charlotte and the three princesses, visited Plymouth Dockyard and inspected the Navy there. He took the opportunity to promote a number of officers, Rayment among them. In October Lieutenant George Brissac recommissioned Speedwell for the Channel. In May 1790 Speedwell was again recommissioned this time under Lieutenant George Paris Monke. Speedwell performed various missions for Admiral Lord Howe. Then in 1782, she was off the Yorkshire coast when she captured a smuggling brig. At 14 guns, the Hell- Afloat was probably as strongly armed as Speedwell, but did not resist capture.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.68. Shortly before the start of the war with France, Monke sailed Speedwell to Hamburg to retrieve some British sailors rescued from various vessels that had wrecked on the coast of Jutland. He brought back about 100. Monke was forced to stay on deck day and night, although on the way back to Britain the weather was bad, to forestall any uprising by the rescued sailors. The fear was that the sailors, who were not anxious to be pressed into the Royal Navy, would try to seize Speedwell and run her ashore. French Revolutionary Wars The voyage from Hamburg so hurt Monke's health that he resigned his appointment in September. Lieutenant Edward Williams replaced Monke. During the night of 22‚Äì23 August 1796, the French privateer cutter Brave approached Speedwell off St Catherine's Point on the Isle of Wight and attempted to board her. Speedwell captured Brave, which was armed with one 6-pounder guns and two swivel guns, and had a crew of 25 men. Brave was only 12 hours out of Cherbourg and had not yet captured anything. Speedwell carried Brave into Spithead. Between October 1796 and April 1797 the Navy had her altered at Portsmouth to a brig. In March Williams received a promotion to Commander; the next month Lieutenant William Birchall recommissioned Speedwell. Lieutenant James Reddy replaced Birchall in September 1798, sailing Speedwell for the North Sea. At some point in 1798 the Royal Navy re-rated her as a gun-brig. On 7 August 1798 and Speedwell intercepted in the North Sea a Swedish convoy under the escort of . The British vessels demanded that the Swedes come into port to have their cargo inspected for enemy (French) cargo. Although Sweden was neutral, Ulla Fersens captain acceded to this demand as the two British vessels out-gunned him and he wanted to avoid loss of life. The Swedish merchant vessels were inspected, one was seized, and the rest departed. Speedwell next appears as a participant in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland (27 August 1799 ‚Äì 19 November 1790). On 24 September Admiral Andrew Mitchell reported that he detached Captain Boorder, in , with Speedwell, to scour the Coast from Steveren to Lemmer. Captain William Bolton of praised Reddy, whom Bolton sent in a flat boat to retrieve the gun-brig , which had grounded around end-September. Subsequently, Speedwell (and also the hired armed lugger Speedwell, were among the vessels that shared in the proceeds of the Vlieter Incident on 28 August 1799, when the Dutch fleet, with 632 guns and 3700 men, surrendered to Admiral Mitchell, without a shot being fired. In early April 1800 \\"the Speedwell Cutter\\" brought into Yarmouth Fancy de Jersey, which she had recaptured off Goree. Fancy had been sailing from Guernsey to Leith when a French privateer lugger captured her.Lloyd's List, no.4039. - accessed 15 May 2015. Next, Speedwell shared with and in the capture on 23 June 1801 of Purissima Concepcion. Speedwell was paid off in July 1802. Napoleonic Wars Between July and August 1803 Speedwell underwent refitting at Sheerness. Lieutenant Donald Fernandez recommissioned her in August. By January 1804 Lieutenant William Robertson had replaced Fernandez. On 15 January 1804, Speedwell, under Robertson's command, was sailing from Guernsey to Dungeness. Speedwell was escorting transports carrying troops of the 43rd Regiment of Foot. She was about five leagues from Beachy Head when she encountered the French privateer lugger Hazard. Hazard, of Boulogne, was under the command of Pierre Fran√ßois Beauvois. She was armed with six guns, but had thrown two overboard during the four-hour chase before she struck. She had a crew of 34 men and had sailed three days earlier from Dieppe. The day before she had captured the sloop Jane, which had been carrying merchandise from Southampton to London. Fate On 18 February 1807 Robertson was still her captain when a storm drove Speedwell onto the shore near Dieppe. There were no survivors.

The station was built in 1906-07 to serve the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, also known as the Milwaukee Road; it replaced the city's original depot, which opened in 1853 with the railroad. Railroad engineer C.F. Loweth designed the station, which features a hipped roof, bracketed overhanging eaves, a red brick exterior with stone trim, and decorative brick quoins and keystones. The station was critical to the city's tobacco industry, which attracted customers from as far away as Europe; the railroad both shipped tobacco to larger cities and brought business agents to the city's firms. Passenger trains to the station, which were used both by residents and the aforementioned businessmen, primarily served routes to Milwaukee and Chicago. The station was remodeled in 1939, though rail travel in Edgerton had already begun to decline by this point; it fell even more significantly in the 1950s and 1960s, and the station closed in 1971.

Its main campus is in Chilpancingo, with facilities in Acapulco, Taxco, Iguala, Tixtla, Ometepec, Tecpan de Galeana, Altamirano and other cities in the state. History =Predecessors= Almost immediately after the foundation of Guerrero as a state in 1849, officials recognized the need to establish an institution of higher education. To this end, the √Ålvarez Literary Institute (Instituto Literario de √Ålvarez) was established by decree on June 5, 1852, to be located at Tixtla. However, the literary institute did not get off the ground for 17 years, hampered by war between liberals and conservatives. On September 11, 1869, the governor of Guerrero, General Francisco O. Arce, revived the institute, and it began operations five days later. In its early years, the Literary Institute was dogged by a lack of teachers and funding; it moved to Chilpancingo upon its designation as the state capital in 1870. A new plan of studies, released in 1885, gave the school colegio status and added several new programs. However, the state's education policy for most of the late 19th and early 20th centuries focused on creating teachers. The Instituto Literario de Varones y de Se√±oritas (Literary Institute for Men and Women), the first normal school in Guerrero, was founded in 1893. It changed names twice, becoming the Mixed Normal School of Guerrero in 1908. Additionally, a law school was created in Chilpancingo in 1903. =A new university= By the early 1940s, the normal school was not faring well. In response, Governor Rafael Catal√°n Calvo established the Colegio del Estado (State College) in April 1942. The State College's programs were modeled on those of the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional, where the governor had studied, and it taught various engineering, agricultural and marine degrees. In 1950, the State College was declared a university, without a name change, and it became a member of the ANUIES, the national association of universities. Throughout the 1950s, students at the school called for the institution's name to be changed to reflect its status, proposing the moniker Universidad del Sur (University of the South). On June 22, 1960, the state legislature promulgated a law creating the Universidad de Guerrero (University of Guerrero), which for a time included the normal and secondary schools that later were transferred to the education department. However, continued calls by students for the university's autonomy went unheeded. A 1960 student strike calling for the autonomy of the university ultimately ended in a massacre claiming nearly 20 lives and the fall of the state government under Governor Ra√∫l Caballero Aburto. In 1963, a new organic law was passed by the state government, granting the university autonomy. =Universidad-Pueblo= The concept of a \\"popular university\\" was brought to Guerrero by rector Rosal√≠o Wences Reza, who served between 1972 and 1975. The model focused on the establishment of a university open to the public, with support for students from poorer economic backgrounds, as well as the creation of preparatory schools across the state and the university's support of social conflicts in Mexico and Latin America. Wences Reza alternated with other rectors, serving again from 1978 to 1981 and from 1984 to 1987. While the university grew, political considerations often clashed with educational priorities and sometimes interfered with the delivery of quality education. Local elites and the state government, alarmed by the ideological stance adopted in this era, harassed the university. This was particularly seen when the university established a radio station in 1982. Radio Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guerrero faced constant jamming and interference, moving frequencies and even at one point to different locations in order to solve its problems. Campuses The Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guerrero has a presence across the state, including its main campus in the state capital of Chilpancingo and programs in major cities such as Acapulco, as well as preparatory schools in dozens of cities statewide. Other university operations Among the university's other operations include the Club Deportivo √Åguilas de la Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guerrero, a professional soccer team founded in 2015 playing in the Tercera Divisi√≥n, and Radio Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guerrero, a radio station on AM and FM which has broadcast since 1982 but has never had an official broadcasting permit or concession.

Recording The song was recorded as a demo during the same session that produced other \\"White Album\\" songs \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" and \\"Wild Honey Pie\\". McCartney recorded one take of the song while waiting for session musicians to arrive. After the take was recorded, the tape was taken away by George Martin's assistant, Chris Thomas. The recording is said to have lyrics, a bridge, and an introduction that is reminiscent of \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\". Unreleased status McCartney himself has not spoken well of \\"Etcetera\\". He has stated that \\"it's a bad song\\" and that he's \\"glad it died in a tape bin\\". On the other hand, engineer Alan Brown called it \\"a very beautiful song.\\" Brown described the song as a \\"ballad and has the word 'etcetera' several times in the lyric.

History and general discussion The Double Wing Attack is one of the most traditional openings dating back to over 250 years ago. Double Wing openings have two general variations. The first one has both bishop diagonals open (that is, P-76 and P-34) while the second type has bishop diagonals closed. The open bishop diagonal variations were most common historically being played from the 1700s and throughout the first part of the twentieth century. However, in modern shogi, the term Aigakari typically refers to the closed bishop diagonal variations. One reason is that the open bishop diagonal position shown in the adjacent diagram most often develops into a Side Pawn Capture opening (where the pawn on 34 or 76 are captured by a rook) instead an open bishop diagonal variation of Double Wing. This a major change from past centuries where Side Pawn Capture openings were uncommon as they were considered to be inferior strategies. In the second half of the 20th century, Side Pawn Capture was recognized as a sound opening ‚Äì eventually becoming one of the most popular Double Static Rook opening among professional players in the 21st century. Thus, a presentday Double Wing opening typically arises when the rook pawns are traded off the board first and only after this are the bishop diagonals opened (if they are opened at all), which prevents the Side Pawn Capture opening possibility. Consequently, the open bishop diagonal variations of Double Wing (without captured side pawns) are not commonly played by professional players (although they are occasionally seen). Closed bishop diagonal variation The initial aim of the Double Wing Attack to threaten each opponent's bishop and to exchange the rook pawns activating the rook. From the start of the game, the pawn at the head of each bishop (23 for White, 87 for Black) is undefended. By advancing each player's rook pawn (at 83 for White, at 27 for Black), each player aims for their opponent's bishop head. Then, the initial strategy involved is to provide the head of the bishop with adequate defense and/or give the bishop an escape route from the advancing pawn. 1\\\\. P-26 P-84, 2. P-25 P-85. Following the joseki, both sides advance their rook pawns to the middle rank 5. 3\\\\. G-78 G-32. Then, golds are moved to defend each bishop's head. Note that the head of the bishop should be defended. (See: ¬ß Protecting the bishops below.) An alternative option is to advance the side or edge pawn allowing the bishop to escape, which leads to a different set of josekis. Another alternative is for Black to play a Floating Rook strategy and prevent White from making a pawn exchange, although Black's Rook becomes somewhat exposed. 4\\\\. P-24 Px24, 5. Rx24. Next, Black initiates a pawn attack on the second file leading to a pawn exchange involving the rook. 5\\\\. ...P*23. White responds by dropping a pawn to 23 to push Black's rook back. After move 10 of Double Wing Attack, the joseki branches off into different variants depending on which square the rook moves down to. (See ¬ß Further strategy branches below.) =Protecting the bishops= After advancing the rook pawns in the first four moves (1. P-26 P-84, 2. P-25 P-85), it is important for both players to protect the bishop's head with a gold rather than immediately pushing their rook pawns again. If either player ignores protecting the bishop after move 4 (a blunder), their bishop may get trapped by a pawn drop according to the famous josekis explained below. (A similar issue occurs in a Bishop Exchange opening where if bishop's head is not protected by a gold, then a pawn drop can occur.) Blunder: Black's failure to defend 5.P-24. This sequence of moves (1.P-26 P-84 2.P-25 P-85 3.P-24) is known as the 5-Move Bomb (‰∫îÊâãÁàÜÂºæ go-te bakudan). If Black continues advancing their rook pawn for an attack at 23 instead of defending with a gold as recommended by joseki, after a pawn exchange on the second file involving the rook, White can start a counterattack by advancing their pawn on the eighth file. Once Black captures White's pawn at 86, rather than recapturing Black's pawn with their rook (as happens in the recommended joseki), White can instead drop a pawn at the bishop's head (P*87). Black's bishop is now trapped. Although Black can also attack White's bishop with a pawn drop, White now has the initiative and will capture Black's bishop first. After Black captures White's tokin at 88 with a silver, with a bishop in hand, White can fork Black's rook and king pawn by dropping their bishop to 35. At this point, the choices for Black's rook are to either retreat or attack White's bishop. (Ignoring the bishop attack may lead to losing the rook.) If Black's rook retreats to rank 8 (as shown in the diagram), then White can promote their bishop to a horse at 57. From here, Black can finally capture White's bishop. =Rook capturing tokin variant= After move 17, White must remove the threat of Black's tokin on 22. Aono and Kitao recommend taking the tokin with the rook, which is defended by a silver. (Hosking suggests a variant in which the silver captures the tokin. See below.) From here, Black may exchange rooks. But, White is in a better position. =Silver capturing tokin variant= Kitao suggests that taking the tokin with White's silver after move 17 is an inferior move. The reason is because Black will drop their bishop to 45 threatening to promote at 63 and further attack White's camp. At this point, White needs to defend 63. However, a gold can't be used for this purpose because that gold would come between the rook and the silver on rank 2 allowing Black to take the silver for free. Therefore, the suggested move is to use the rook to defend both 63 and 22. Black now drops a pawn to put the king in check. This move tries to force White's rook to capture the pawn at 52 with White's rook (Rx52), which will allow Black to successfully promote their bishop at 63 and attack White's rook (Bx63). Kitao considers this position uncertain compared to the position in which the rook captures the tokin. If White uses a gold to capture the checking pawn (Gx52), then the rook's defense of the silver will be blocked allowing Black to capture the silver (Rx22). However, Hosking has a different suggestion which Kitao does not consider. Hosking's silver variant In contrast to Aono and Kitao, Hosking recommends the silver taking the tokin along with the defense of this silver as shown below. If White captures the tokin with the silver, Black can now use their newly obtained bishop in the next move. Black can drop their bishop to 45 (or 36) attacking 63. If White tries to defend 63 with another piece now, the rook's defense of the silver on 22 will be blocked allowing Black to capture the silver on 22. Thus, Hosking's solution to defend the silver with a gold. Black's bishop can promote, but White can attack the bishop with a gold now (since the rook is freed up from its defensive role). Later White may capture more of Black's pawns with either their rook or horse leading to a stronger position for White. =Ignoring White's counterattack= If Black entertains the possibility of ignoring White completely and continuing their attack by dropping a pawn at 23 to attack White's bishop after move 6, the end result stills favors White. Both White and Black's pawn can advance and promote, and Black captures the bishop first. White recaptures the tokin with a silver. Since White's silver at 22 is defended by their rook and Black has no more pawns to drop, Black's best move is to defend against White's attack by retreating to rank 8. Otherwise, White will capture both Black's bishop as well as Black's silver and promote their rook at the same time. With Black's rook defending 88, the number of pieces in an exchange is even: White's tokin and rook vs Black's silver and rook. However, White can now drop a dangling pawn on 86 which threatens to promote on 87 attacking Black's silver. At this point, White will capture Black's bishop and break through their camp in future moves leaving Black in an inferior position. Black cannot save their bishop and will probably lose either their knight or silver when White's dangling pawn promotes. There is also the additional risk of White's rook promoting on the eighth file. Although Black was able to get a bishop, White has Black's bishop and also has more captured pieces. Blunder: White's failure to defend According to joseki, when both Black and White defend their bishops with a gold, after White exchanges their rook pawn, Black is recommended to drop a pawn to 8g for move 15 (see above). However, if Black defends their bishop with gold but White does not and instead continues with a premature advance of their rook pawn, joseki recommends a different strategy. After White attacks 87 and the subsequent pawn exchange, joseki recommends that Black start a counterattack at the head of White's bishop (23) by the rook pawn rather than trying to defensively attack White's rook. (The reason for this is that White's rook could simply fall back to a floating rook position on 84 thus preventing Black from making a pawn exchange on the second file and then controlling the flow of the game.) After Black's counterattack, White will capture Black's pawn. This pawn capture by White allows Black to drop a pawn (obtained from the eighth file pawn exchange) at the head of White's bishop. White can follow suit and also drop a pawn at the head of Black's bishop. But, Black captures White's bishop first. After White recaptures Black's tokin on the second file, Black drops the bishop on 75 creating a rook‚Äìpawn fork. (Although it's possible that Black could also protect their bishop by capturing White's pawn with their gold [8. Gx77], this is a bad move since White's rook will be able to promote after taking Black's gold [8. ...Rx77+].) White now has a choice between retreating their rook back to their camp at 82 or attacking Black's bishop. If the bishop on 75 is attacked (as shown here, R-85), then Black will promote their bishop on fifth file. White's rook can continue to attack the bishop (R-55), but Black can continue eluding capture with a sidestep to the fourth file. White's rook can now promote (R-57+), but Black can defend their king with a pawn drop (P*58). White can capture another pawn (+Rx47), but Black can gain a knight (+Bx21). This position is thought to still favor Black. Blunder: Inferiority of silver Using a silver to defend the head of the bishop is considered a bad formation (ÊÇ™ÂΩ¢ akukei) even though it appears somewhat similar in that the silver can defend the head of the bishop. However, a silver cannot defend from the sides leaving the bishop without any direct connection to a defending piece. For instance, in the adjacent diagram, Black moves the left silver beside the bishop to prepare for White's attack from their advancing rook pawn. Due to Black's poor bishop‚Äìsilver formation, White will now open their bishop's diagonal to take advantage of this situation. This move by White also prevents Black from opening their diagonal since doing so would lead to White capturing Black's bishop without penalty. Furthermore, this position cannot be easily repaired since Black's silver cannot retreat to its original position. =Further strategy branches= After move 10 of Double Wing Attack, the joseki branches off into different variants depending on which square the rook moves down to. In the Floating Rook variant, the rook moves to 26. In the Retreating Rook variant, the rook returns to 28. Retreating Rook Retreating Rook (Âºï„ÅçÈ£õËªä hikihisha) is an opening following the Double Wing opening proper in which Black's rook retreats all the way back to their camp allowing White to also exchange rook pawns. Floating Rook In contrast to the Retreating Rook variant of Double Wing Attack, Floating Rook (ÊµÆ„ÅçÈ£õËªä) aims to protect rank 6 and prevent White from exchanging pawns on the eighth file to get a pawn in hand. The translated term floating is synonymous with the term hanging as in hanging piece used in western chess where floating means a piece that is not defended by another piece. Old Double Wing opening The Old Double Wing (ÊóßÂûãÁõ∏Êéõ„Åã„Çä or ÊóßÂûãÁõ∏Êá∏„Çä) is rarely seen presently. However, it was the Double Wing variation used up until a little after World War II and early versions of it were used starting from 1625. After the initial opening sequence, unlike modern Double Wing, it is characterized by both players pushing the central pawns (P-56 and ...P-54) supported by a right (attacking) silver behind the central pawn (that is, S-57 and S-53). The Old Double Wing opening became obsolete after central pawn push strategies were replaced by pushing pawns on the fourth file with the Reclining Silver strategy (sixth file for White). A joseki for the Old Double Wing opening is the Silver Three Pawn joseki (ÈäÄÊ≠©‰∏âÂÆöË∑°). Open bishop diagonal variation 1\\\\. P-77. Black opens their bishop diagonal. This is the most flexible first move. 1\\\\. ...P-34. White responds by opening their bishop diagonal as well. This variation of Double Wing with both players' bishop diagonals open from the start is a much less common way to play Double Wing. More often than not, this positioning accompanied by dual double rook pawn pushes will lead to a Side Pawn Capture opening or a Tempo Loss Bishop Exchange opening. However, hundreds of years ago, this positioning with all major pieces activated was very typical of the Double Wing Attack. Furthermore, accepting the side pawn gambit was considered a poor move (thus, Side Pawn Capture openings were uncommon) and the modern Tempo Loss Bishop Exchange had not been invented yet. 2\\\\. P-24 P-84. Both players give an early indication of choosing a Static Rook opening by advancing their rook pawns. Thus, the game will likely be a Double Static Rook opening. 3\\\\. P-25 P-85. Both continue their rook pawn advances to the middle rank 5. Thus, the likelihood of a Double Static Rook game increases. 4\\\\. G-78.

It was published on May 3, 2016, and is the first book in The Trials of Apollo series, the second spin-off of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. The book and its cover art by John Rocco were first announced in 2015. It has been published in hardcover, audiobook, ebook, and large-print editions. To date, The Hidden Oracle has been translated into 19 languages from its original English. The book follows the god Apollo, who is turned into a human teenager and thrown down from Olympus to New York City as a punishment by his father Zeus. Joined by the demigod Meg McCaffrey, Apollo goes to Camp Half-Blood, where he discovers that he will have to regain control of the five oracles of Ancient Greece in order to receive pardon from Zeus. The novel received positive reviews from critics, who praised Apollo's narration and the book's humor. During its first week of release, The Hidden Oracle sold about 62,000 copies, reaching the top of The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It won the 2016 Goodreads Choice Award for Middle Grade and Children's Fiction.  Plot summary  After falling into a dumpster in a New York City alley, the god Apollo has only very vague memories of his father, Zeus, punishing him. He learns that he was turned into a human teenager named Lester Papadopoulos. In the alley, two thugs try to mug him, but a young girl named Meg McCaffrey saves him, using fruit to chase the thugs away. Meg claims Apollo's service, binding him to her until he is done with his trials, which he must complete to become a god again. Apollo and Meg go to find Percy Jackson. With the help of Percy, Apollo and Meg journey to Camp Half Blood, a camp for demigods. On their way, they get attacked by plague spirits. Meg subconsciously summons a karpos, who defeats the spirits. Meg decides to keep him and names him Peaches, but he only shows up when she's in trouble. After arriving at the Camp, Apollo discovers that the Oracle of Delphi, in the form of Rachel Elizabeth Dare, can no longer issue prophecies; similarly, travel and communication do not work for any of the demigods. The centaur Chiron also mentions that campers have been randomly disappearing into the woods. At dinner, Meg is attacked by demigods who she previously angered. Peaches comes to her rescue, but the other demigods then attack Peaches, believing him to be dangerous. To save him, Meg reveals that her golden rings can turn into sickles made of Imperial gold. Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, claims her as her daughter. The next day, Apollo tries to practice music and archery; being imperfect, he swears on the river Styx to never use a bow or a musical instrument until he is a god again. During a \\"three-legged death race\\" inside the Labyrinth, Apollo and Meg end up under Delphi in Greece. They overhear Delphi's guard, Python, talking to \\"the Beast\\" about how to control all the oracles and destroy the Grove of Dodona. ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù assures Python that he has ‚Äúwell-placed help within the camp.‚Äù The encounter terrifies them, especially Meg. They escape the Labyrinth, and Chiron reveals that Apollo's children, Kayla and Austin, disappeared. Chiron and Meg advise Apollo to not search for them and the other missing demigods just yet, much to his anger. Instead, Apollo and Meg keep lookout for them, and Meg reveals that she knows ‚Äúthe Beast‚Äù because of his reputation of taking demigods to train and use as servants. When Meg refused to work for him, he killed her father. Her stepfather then took her in, gave her the swords, and taught her how to fight. Rachel arrives at the camp. She reveals that a secretive company, Triumvirate Holdings, has conspired against the gods and is attempting to control all the oracles, starting with Dodona, which is located at the camp and has been drawing campers to itself. The next day, Apollo and Meg go searching for the grove, but are attacked by myrmekes. In an attempt to drive them away, Apollo plays music, breaking his oath. The myrmekes kidnap Meg and escape. Apollo tries to return to the camp, but begins to hallucinate; before passing out, he finds Rhea, who gives him wind chimes to put on the largest tree in the Grove of Dodona and teleports him back to camp. Upon awakening, he learns that the leader of Triumvirate Holdings is Emperor Nero. Apollo returns to the forest and finds the home of the myrmekes, rescuing Meg. They discover the entrance of the grove, along with the missing demigods. Nero appears and reveals that he is now a ‚Äúgod-emperor,‚Äù as he found a way to turn himself and the other two emperors in Triumvirate Holdings gods, using the worshipping they received throughout history. He also reveals that Meg is the ‚Äúwell-placed help,‚Äù and he is her stepfather. Meg commands Apollo to help her open the Grove, and he is forced to obey. Nero tries to burn the grove down, but Peaches, sensing Meg's true feelings of guilt and regret, attacks him before he can. Nero and Apollo briefly fight each other, and Meg runs into the Grove. Apollo regains his godly strength for a few seconds, allowing him to defeat his guards. Nero uses Greek fire in a last attempt to destroy the grove. The dryads come to help, consuming the fire to save the grove and sacrificing themselves in the process. Apollo helps Meg put the wind chimes on the largest tree, which gives a prophecy to Apollo. Meg releases him from her service and runs away, insisting that Nero isn't ‚Äúthe Beast‚Äù and there's still hope for him. Apollo realizes that she views Nero and ‚Äúthe Beast‚Äù as two separate people, a result of Nero's years of mental/emotional abuse. Nero sends the Colossus Neronis to destroy the camp, but with the help of Percy and the other campers, Apollo defeats the statue by hitting it with a plague- enchanted arrow. The next morning, Leo Valdez and Calypso return to Camp Half- Blood, and the two offer to help Apollo in his quest to rescue the Oracle of Trophonius from Triumvirate Holdings. = Characters = * Apollo / Lester Papadopoulos: is the main protagonist. One of the Twelve Olympians, Apollo was cast down from Olympus and turned into a human named Lester by Zeus after the war against Gaea in The Blood of Olympus. Zeus blames him for encouraging his descendant, the augur Octavian, to follow his dangerous path and for prematurely revealing the Prophecy of Seven. Lester is a narcissistic, 16-year-old, out-of-shape teenager with curly brown hair, blue eyes, and acne. * Meg McCaffrey: is a 12-year-old daughter of Demeter. Her father was murdered by \\"the Beast\\" and she was subsequently adopted by Emperor Nero, where she was abused and manipulated to believe that they are separate people. She owns a pair of crescent rings which can transform into sickles made of Imperial gold, the Roman sacred metal, as a gift from Nero. * Peaches: a karpoi (grain spirit) which Meg involuntarily summons after she, Lester, and Percy are attacked by the nosoi, the spirits of disease. He also appears when Meg is in danger. * Nero: is the main antagonist. He is a legacy of Apollo and a Roman Emperor, infamous for his tyranny and luxury with little regard for his subjects. Alongside the other two Emperors, Nero has influenced many events in history through Triumvirate Holdings, using the company to supply funding for Luke Castellan during Percy Jackson & the Olympians and Octavian and Camp Jupiter during The Heroes of Olympus. Because of his fame, he has always been worshiped throughout history, so he can not die. He refers to himself as a \\"god-emperor\\".  Composition and marketing  In October 2015, during the promotional tour for The Sword of Summer, the first book in the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard series, Rick Riordan announced that he was working on a new series of five books based on Apollo. The first novel was titled The Hidden Oracle and planned to be launched on May 3, 2016. According to Riordan, he had the idea to make a new series in the universe of Percy Jackson after he wrote Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, when he discovered two myths about Zeus punishing Apollo, turning him into a mortal. Riordan liked the concept and decided to \\"subject poor Apollo to that punishment for a third time and write a series from his point of view as a newly outcast 16-year-old mortal\\". However, he promised that many of the characters from Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus would return in the new series. Because Apollo is the god of poetry, the name of each chapter would be a \\"bad haiku\\". The cover, illustrated by John Rocco, was revealed on October 10, 2015; it shows the two versions of Apollo in an alley of New York City. Two months later, on December 10, the third chapter was made available for free download by USA Today. The first chapter was released along with the collection of short stories Demigods & Magicians on April 5, 2016. In addition, three trailers were released on YouTube to promote the book. A launch event occurred at the Harvard Book Store on the day of publication.  Release  The Hidden Oracle was released in the United States by Disney-Hyperion on May 3, 2016. An audiobook, narrated by Robbie Daymond, was published on the same date by Books on Tape. On May 4, Thorndike Press published a large-print edition in hardcover. The book also received e-book and paperback versions, and has been translated into 19 languages. For the first printing, Disney-Hyperion offered different gifts that varied according to where the book was purchased: a letter from Apollo to Zeus at Barnes & Noble, an illustrated map of Apollo's trials at Camp Half-Blood at Target, a bumper sticker of Apollo at Books-a- Million, two-sided bookmarks with the divine and mortal versions of Apollo at Walmart, and an illustrated poster depicting the \\"plague of secrets\\" at Costco. The Hidden Oracle sold over 62,000 copies during the first week. Upon release, the book ranked 1 on The New York Times bestseller list and Publishers Weeklys bestseller list, remaining on the latter for 32 weeks. It placed 2 on USA Todays bestseller list and Amazon's bestseller list. The book's lexile score is 680L, making it appropriate for readers aged 11 to 13. Most reviewers label it appropriate material for grades 5‚Äì8, although some also include grades as low as 3 and as high as 12.  Reception  The novel received positive reviews. Many highlighted the novel as an enjoyable continuation of Riordan's previous work. April Spisak, wrote in The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books that \\"Riordan fans will find all of the key elements here: wisecracking narration, underdog kid turned hero... mythological core, and robust side characters\\" In the same way, The Guardian highlighted Riordan's ability to \\"inject humor, even during sad moments\\" into his writing. Sarah Hunter of Booklist praised the way Riordan mixed comedic elements with \\"Greek myths throughout the story [which] adds some emotional depth to his often vainglorious lead.\\" The book's narration by the god Apollo was also praised, described as a major change from earlier books. Karen Rought of Hypable lauded Riordan's presentation of the story through a god rather than his usual perspective of a demigod, commenting: \\"seeing Percy Jackson from a former god's point of view is both hilarious and enchanting\\". Kirkus praised this narration, noting Apollo's bragging about his own \\"godly virtues (including his open bisexuality) and [his] gripes about his current awkwardness and servitude to Meg\\". Aditi Saha of The Times of India regards Apollo as Riordan's best character whose \\"love for poems, sarcasm, and selfishness will make any readers fall for his unusual charm\\". She also praised the \\"portrait of Greek mythology complete with a well-developed world\\", but criticized the lack of introduction to the old characters. Similarly, Carrie R. Wheadon of Common Sense Media commented positively on the narration, but unlike Saha, felt that due to \\"balance between mythological monster battles and character growth, humor, and pathos, this start to a spin- off of a spin-off series doesn't disappoint longtime Riordan fans\\". Reviewers have expressed appreciation for other differences from Riordan's previous works as well. Writing for the School Library Journal, Beth L. Meister highlighted the diversity of the characters, especially with Apollo openly discussing his bisexuality. According to Katherine Szabo of Kidsreads, the inclusion of racially diverse and LGBT characters was \\"the forefront of the story\\". She also called the fact that the book was shorter than its predecessors \\"very refreshing\\". The audiobook was also well received. Publishers Weekly commented that \\"Robbie Daymond‚Äôs narration is delightful: lively and comical, he perfectly captures the lovably conceited and pompous Apollo\\". The AudioFile review also praised Daymond's performance, saying that \\"Riordan's funny writing and Daymond's narration make sure the listener is always on Apollo's side as he learns how to manage without his godly gifts.\\" The Hidden Oracle won the Goodreads Choice Award for the Middle Grade and Children's Fiction of 2016.  Sequel  The second book of The Trials of Apollo is titled The Dark Prophecy and was announced by Riordan on May 5, 2016. The cover and the first chapter were released on December 22, 2016. The Dark Prophecy was released on May 2, 2017 and sold 63,000 copies in the first week. The third book, The Burning Maze was published on May 1, 2018. The fourth book, The Tyrant's Tomb was published in October 2019.

The book takes off from where The Hidden Oracle ended, wherein Apollo continues his search as a human teenager to restore the Oracles of Ancient Greece that have gone dark in order to regain his immortality. Along with Meg McCaffrey, he journeys to the Oracle of Trophonius in Indianapolis and later settles his personal feud with Commodus, the second Emperor of the Triumvirate Holdings. The novel received positive reviews from critics for its slow pace, humor and diverse characters. During its first week of release, The Dark Prophecy sold about 63,000 copies, reaching the top of The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. Plot summary Six weeks after losing Meg McCaffrey to Nero and receiving the first prophecy, Apollo, Leo, Festus and Calypso are headed on a journey to stop Nero, the Beast, from controlling all of the oracles. They are rescued from attacking blemmyae by Hemithea and invited into the Waystation, in the Indianapolis Union Station, where Apollo recalls offering to turn Hemithea into a goddess but having his gift rejected to join the Hunters of Artemis. He learns that she is in a relationship with Josephine and the two of them have sacrificed their immortality as Hunters for love and are living as mortals. Their adopted daughter Georgina went missing after searching for the Oracle of Trophonius to receive a prophecy to prevent the Emperor Commodus from taking their animals. Instead, she receives a message that damages her mind and causes her to wander away. Britomartis, the goddess of nets and owner of the Waystation, issues Apollo and Calypso a quest to rescue the griffins stolen by Commodus. The duo manages to rescue the griffins but is cornered by Lityerses, Commodus' man. Meg McCaffrey arrives and duels with Lityerses until Apollo releases the rest of the caged animals. Apollo then picks up Meg on his griffin while Lityerses gets trampled, and the three go to the Waystation. Apollo, Leo, and Meg head to Commodus's lair and free all the captured animals and prisoners, including Georgina. They search for the Throne of Memory and find it, but they are discovered by Commodus. They manage to escape with the help of Festus and the Huntresses of Artemis and rescue Lit, who was to be executed. They take everyone back to the Waystation, where Georgina relays a recorded message by Trophonius, who is revealed to be Apollo's son. He refers to Georgina as a sister, leading everyone to believe she is Apollo's daughter. Apollo and Meg decide to travel to the Oracle for the prophecy, while the rest defend the Waystation. At the Oracle, Apollo drinks from both the River of Memory and of Forgetfulness, which makes him lose his sanity. Meg sings a song of Apollo's sufferings which jogs Apollo back to reality and awakens the spirit of Trophonius. Apollo pleads with Trophonius to take him instead of Meg, to which Trophonius agrees in return for a wish, but gives her the prophecy anyway. Apollo performs CPR on Meg and destroys the Oracle, fulfilling Trophonius's wish. Peaches the karpoi and his friends drive them to the Waystation in time for battle. Apollo finds Commodus fighting Josephine, Calypso, Lit, and Thalia while holding Leo, Hemithea, and Georgina hostage. Apollo feels a surge of strength inside him and warns Commodus to stand down. He does not pay heed to Apollo's words. Apollo announces he is going to reveal his godly form, blinding Commodus. Meg reveals a prophecy in the form of a Shakespearan sonnet, which tells them that they must warn Camp Jupiter of an attack in five days and will have to travel in the Labyrinth with the assistance of a satyr. Meg summons the closest satyr using her powers, who turns out to be Grover Underwood. = Characters = * Apollo / Lester Papadopoulos: The main protagonist.

The novel also placed on USA Today 's bestseller list. It opened at No. 11 on the iBooks bestseller list, but dropped to 18th place a week later and further to 20th after another week. As of February 2018, the book has sold more than 252,000 copies in hardcover format alone. The book received a Lexile score of 700L, making it age- and difficulty-appropriate for the average 11-13 year-old. On Scholastic, the book is recommended to teachers as appropriate material for grades 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12. A reviewer for Common Sense Media rated the book as 10+, while another reviewer wrote that the book was better suited for a younger audience, comprising 8 to 20 year olds, claiming that older readers would find it hard to believe the exaggerated drama. Reception The novel received positive reviews, but overall much less attention than the first in the series. Preeja Aravind of The Free Press Journal opined that the book appeals to Riordan's already established fantasy, with the old characters showing development. While stating the book is a standalone, Aravind recommends reading the predecessor first. Gillian P. of Pikes Peak Library District's Teen Team felt otherwise, rating the book 5/5 and called it \\"every bit as good as the first book\\", highly recommending it to fans of Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus. One topic frequently noted in by critics is the characters and their development. Carrie R. Wheadon of Common Sense Media praises the addition of characters such as the ex-immortal couple Emmie and Jo as a way to increase depth. She notes that this novel is more an exploration of other characters and their relationships to Apollo than it is about the god himself. Karen Rought of Hypable states that the author's continued introduction of diverse characters feels completely natural and is never forced, writing it \\"feels like a truer snapshot of the world than most books ever attempt to display\\". She finds the relationship between Apollo and Calypso particularly interesting. Pamela Kramer, former National Book Reviewer for Examiner.com, praised the characterization of Apollo as well, calling him \\"the brightest sun of all.\\" She appreciated Riordan's choice to make the god bisexual. However, not all reviewers thought this character development benefitted the novel. Reviewers were divided on the subject of the novel's quick pacing. Wheadon of Common Sense Media criticizes the fast-paced action, stating that it causes the reader to forget important details. In contrast, The Times of India compliments the pacing and writes that it gives the reader time to stop and think about the contrast between immortality and a meaningful life. Hypable's review praises how Riordan manages instill humor in even tough situations. Writing for Young Adult Books Central, Karen Yingling agrees. She rates the book 5/5, appreciating how the descriptions of random facts not important to the plot adds humor. She also appreciates \\"his inclusion of very obscure mythological characters, and the way that he manages to work their mythological story into his own.\\" The AudioFile magazine lauded the audiobook narration, writing, \\"Narrator Robbie Daymond is perfectly tuned in as events take a darker turn in this sequel to The Hidden Oracle.... There's plenty of adventure and humor here, and listeners will finish this installment already eager for the next one\\". The novel was nominated for Best Middle Grade & Children's Book of 2017 in the Goodreads Choice Awards, and ended in second place, behind The Ship of the Dead, also written by Riordan. Sequel The third book of The Trials of Apollo is titled The Burning Maze and was announced by Riordan on October 17, 2017. It released on May 1, 2018.

Bullaty is known for her \\"lyrical composition\\" and strong use of color during her fifty-year collaboration with her husband, Angelo Lomeo. Bullaty and Lomeo's photographs appeared in LIFE, Time and Audubon magazines and journal. They have both exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the International Center of Photography, the George Eastman House, UMPRUM Museum in Prague, in the Nikon House galleries and other venues.  Biography  Bullaty was born in Prague to a Jewish banking family. Her family gave her a camera when she turned fourteen. Since Bullaty had been forced to leave school at the time, the camera was a \\"consolation gift.\\" When Bullaty was eighteen, she was deported by the Nazis to Poland, where she was kept in the Lodz ghetto, and then later taken to Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camps. During a death march near Dresden, she and a friend successfully hid in a barn and were able to escape and return to Prague. When she got back to her home city, she discovered that no one else in her family had survived the Holocaust. Bullaty, \\"her head shaved,\\" saw and answered an advertisement to be the helper to Czech photographer, Josef Sudek. As his assistant, she mixed chemicals for the darkroom, organized his negatives and learned from his sense of composition. Sudek called her his \\"apprentice-martyr.\\" Sudek's work often focused on the Czech landscape and windows, such as in the series The Windows of My Studio (1940-1954). Bullaty also photographed windows, but unlike Sudek, who photographed his own windows looking out, Bullaty photographed windows looking into buildings. Bullaty published a book, Sudek (1978), about her mentor, and it was the first publication of his work in the West. A \\"distant relative\\" of Bullaty found her name on a Holocaust survivor's list and invited her to stay in New York in 1947, paying the boat fair from Europe for Bullaty. Bullaty quit working for Sudek, but they remained friends, exchanging letters over the years. Many of his letters to her were written on the backs of his photographs. Bullaty found work with a photographer on her third day in New York. Also in 1947, she met Angelo Lomeo. They were brought together when she was inquiring about a darkroom in a building he managed. Lomeo was intrigued by Bullaty's accent and went to see her. They started photographing together a year later, traveling and sharing resources; during their time together, they became close. Bullaty and Lomeo were married in 1951. Later, when she was married, she and her husband would visit Sudek and bring him photography supplies. They visited him in Czechoslovakia \\"almost yearly.\\" In 1971, she helped mount an exhibition of Sudek's work in New York. As photographers, Bullaty and Lomeo started using studio cameras, but eventually changed to working on location with 35-mm SLR cameras. They began their career photographing artwork for museums and galleries. In addition, much of their work was originally in black and white, but they switched to color in 1970. Lomeo and Bullaty had their first photographic assignment in 1948, located in the American South. While photographing, Bullaty was grabbed by a Ku Klux Klansman and \\"pretended to be merely a tourist.\\" Bullaty and Lomeo worked together on assignments all over the world. One series that Bullaty and Lomeo worked together on included windows from around the world and was featured in Popular Photography magazine. LIFE magazine featured their photos of Yugoslavian peasant-painters and their art in 1964. The couple were the first to receive the Olivia Ladd Gilliam Award from the Orion Society. Despite working together, Bullaty had her own personal vision: she was intrigued by \\"Kafkaesque shadows she remembers from her childhood.\\" She also captured the effects of climate and seasons in her landscape work. Bullaty said, \\"I have often felt that the reason I celebrate life and beauty is precisely because I have seen so much pain and ugliness.\\" Bullaty died from cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on October 5, 2000. In 2001, Bullaty and Lomeo had 72 photographs featured in The World Trade Center Remembered.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history West Rutland Town Hall is a rectangular brick building, set on a triangular lot in West Rutland's center, formed by the Marble Street to the northeast and Main Street to the southwest. It is an imposing two-story structure, covered by a hip roof and set on a raised foundation of rock-faced marble. A gabled section projects from its front facade, with the main entrance at its centered set in a recess that is further sheltered by a flat- roof pavilion. The recess has a marble surround with smooth marble columns set at the sides. The projecting sections and the main roof both have dentillated and modillioned cornices. The ground floor houses town offices, organize around a central corridor, and the upper floor has a large auditorium space with a stage set under a proscenium arch. The interior retains many of its original period finishes. Acquisition of the land, and the construction of the building were authorized by town meeting in 1907. The building was completed in 1909 to a design by Rutland architect Charles Paige, at a total cost of about $30,000. The ground floor spaces, now partly filled with municipal offices, originally housed the town clerk, public library, and classrooms for both elementary and high school grades. The upstairs auditorium over time was put to multiple uses, including town meetings, dances and other social events, and political rallies. It was closed in the 1970s, when such events were moved to a newer school auditorium.

The Norse settled Vatnahverfi in the late 10th century and farmed there for nearly 500 years before mysteriously disappearing from the district and the entirety of Greenland, likely at some point in the latter 15th century. Its name is roughly translated as ‚ÄúLake District.\\" Pastoral land in Vatnahverfi. Modern farms in the district are almost invariably situated on former Norse sites.  Placement  Located on Greenland's southwest coast, Vatnahverfi can be broadly thought of as a peninsula stretching northeast from the Labrador Sea to the Jespersens Glacier some 60 km inland and covering approximately 500 km2. It lies between Einarsfjord (today the fjord and the settlement at the fjord's head are both called Igaliku) and Hrafnsfjord (today called Agdluitsoq). The heart of peninsula (60.732307, -45.458640) is approximately 140 km northwest of Greenland's southernmost tip at Cape Farewell.Major landmarks in Vatnahverfi  Settlement  During the Norse period, Vatnahverfi was initially settled by kinsmen of Erik the Red who accompanied him in a large exodus out of Iceland in 985 AD. The Greenlander's Saga states that ‚Äúmen who went abroad with Eirik took possession of land in Greenland‚Äù and includes in a list of founding chieftains a man named Hafgrim who claimed ‚ÄúHafgr√≠msfj√∂r√∞ and Vatnahverfi.‚Äù A similar account can also be found in the Landn√°mab√≥k (Book of Settlements). Erik and his kinsmen usually established their homesteads away from the Labrador Sea, preferring the inland heads of Greenland's southwest fjords where the temperature was milder and the land better suited to their pastoral way of life. This was largely the case in Vatnahverfi too, with the majority of its homesteads situated in the northern half of the peninsula 30 km or more away from the ocean (though the fjords gave them easy access to it). One point of difference with Vatnahverfi in this regard is that many of its farms were also situated inland on lakes and rivers rather than just on the fjords, as was generally the case in other districts. Archaeologists have identified the remains of 50 Norse farms in Vatnahverfi alone, comprising 10% of the known farms in the Eastern Settlement as a whole. Its population is estimated to have been an average of 8 to 10 individuals per farm - approximately 500 total - during the colony's zenith. The greatest concentration of Vatnahverfi's farms lay between Hafgrimsfjord and Austfjord (both of which are branches of Einarsfjord) on the peninsula's northwest portion. Hafgrim himself likely settled at the head of his namesake fjord where ruins of a large homestead can still be seen. He and his descendants would have been considered the de facto chieftains of the district. The homestead also featured a small church, believed by Helge Ingstad to be the Langanes church described in the Saga of Einar Sokkeson. The area is called Eqaluit (‚Äúsalmon-place‚Äù) by modern Inuit Greenlanders. The area near the head of Austfjord (today called Sondre Igaliku or Igaliku Kujalleq) further north was also an important hub in Vatnahverfi, presumably due to its close proximity and easy access by foot or boat to Gardar about 15 km to the northwest, where the colony's bishopric and Althing parliament were located. As with Hafgrimsfjord there was a small church in Austfjord, called Undir Hofdi. A lump of heat-fused clay and glass found in the ruins of the church suggests that it was burnt at some point, as was possibly the case with larger churches in Brattahlid, Gardar, and Herjolfsnes. Ruins of the Undir Hofdi church The district's farms appear to have been quite rich and productive. Archaeological excavations revealed that the Norse settlers of Vatnahverfi raised cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, and also kept horses and dogs. The Norwegian crown owned a property called Kongsgarden at the head of Hrafnsfjord in an area called Foss (waterfalls), which was said to be a rich salmon run.Helge Ingstad, Land Under the Pole Star (New York: St. Martin's, 1966), pg. 245-8  Vatnahverfi In Documented History  In addition to the references in The Greenlander's Saga and Landn√°mab√≥k, Vatnahverfi was the likely setting of an event described in the Saga of Einar Sokkeson, where the protagonist killed a visiting Norwegian merchant during a banquet with the tacit approval of Bishop Arnold. A Norwegian priest named Ivar Bardarson, who lived in the colony in the mid 14th century as a representative of the Archdiocese of Nidaros and the Norwegian crown, noted in his account titled Descriptions of Greenland of the abundant fish in the district's lakes. Bardarson also referenced an island named \\"Ren√∏e\\" (Caribo Island) which was said to be an episcopal reindeer farm owned by the Gardar bishopric. Archeologists believe this may have been located on what is now called Akia,Poul Baltzer Heide & Christian Koch Madsen, Norse Coastal Landscapes (Copenhagen, National Museum of Denmark, 2011) pg. 50 an island about 26 km southwest of Hafgrimsfjord.  Aboriginal Contact  Although various branches of Paleo-Eskimos had lived in Greenland as far back as 2500 BC, they are believed to have almost entirely abandoned the island by the time of the initial Norse arrival. The Little Climatic Optimum was then in full force and would have made the Norse areas of settlement on the southwest coast particularly unattractive to arctic hunter-gatherers such as the Dorset. In fact, it is believed that the Norse Greenlanders‚Äô first contact with North American aboriginals was not in Greenland at all, but rather with the Beothuk in Newfoundland as described in The Greenlanders Saga and Erik the Red‚Äôs Saga. Subsequent generations of Norse Greelanders began encountering Thule Inuit in the Northsetur hunting districts far to the north of their settlements, where walrus and narwhal ivory could be obtained. The Thule (who began displacing the Dorset in North America's arctic around 1000 AD) eventually arrived in the areas of Norse settlement as the Little Ice Age allowed them to increase their southern range, at a time when the Norse presence in Greenland was coming to an end. Oral histories from the Inuit tell of both friendship and hostility between the two peoples.  Disappearance  Having endured for nearly a half- millennium, the exact fate of the Norse settlers in Vatnahverfi and the rest of Greenland remains unknown, although several factors were likely involved. The Greenlanders' pastoral way of life would have been severely challenged by the onset of the Little Ice Age, much more so than their counterparts in Europe. DNA analysis of the Norse Greenlanders' remains from the final known generations shows that marine-based protein - especially from seals - became an increasingly large part of their diet, even in pastoral areas like Vatnahverfi, whereas remains dating from Erik the Red's landn√°m period showed that most of their diet was land-based. Other theories include the possibility of conflict with the Thule and predation by European pirates. There is no indication from archaeology or human remains that the Norse intermarried with the Thule or adopted their way of life, nor any record from Iceland or Norway that hints of an exodus out of Greenland. Historical records do suggest that ships from Europe arrived less frequently owing to the worsening sea conditions. The traditional Norse route to reach Greenland was to sail due west from Iceland‚Äôs Sn√¶fellsnes peninsula until reaching eastern Greenland‚Äôs Ammassalik district, then sailing south along the coast to reach the settlements on the other side of Cape Farewell. However, by the mid-1300‚Äôs, Ivar Bardarson noted that the quantity of ice from the northeast was such that ‚Äúno one sails this old route without putting their life in danger.‚ÄùElaine Barrow & Mike Hulme, Climates of the British Isles: Present, Past and Future (London: Routledge, 1997) pg. 129 The Norwegian Crown in Oslo and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros eventually abandoned the colony to its own devices, although some Popes were aware of the situation. In 1448, Pope Nicholas V wrote about the diocese in Greenland (\\"a region situated at the uttermost end of the earth\\"), in which he lamented reports that it had been without a resident Bishop for some 30 years. These concerns were echoed in a letter dated circa 1500 by Pope Alexander VI, who believed that no communion had been performed in Greenland for a century, and that no ship had visited there in the past 80 years. However, even after the colony was forsaken by the Church, the empty title \\"Bishop of Gardar\\" continued to be held by a succession of at least 18 individuals well into the 16th century, none of whom visited their nominal diocese and only one of whom (Bishop Mattias Knutsson) reportedly expressed any desire to do so.Laurence Larson, \\"The Church In North America\\" Catholic Historical Review Vol. 5, No. 2/3, (1919) pg. 193. Some sites in Vatnahverfi give clues as to the fate of its Norse inhabitants. A farm located a few kilometres inland from Austfjord (farm site 64c) had been covered in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep, suggesting that Norse farming and deforestation had left parts of the area vulnerable to erosion and desertification. At another nearby homestead (farm site 64a), one of the recovered artifacts was a piece of a church bell, which suggests that the Norse continued to live in Greenland after some of the churches were destroyed. At another large inland farm about half way between Hafgrimsfjord and Austfjord (farm site 167), archaeologists found the remains of a solitary Norse Greenlander who appears to have lain down and died in the entrance way of the house, the implication being that there was nobody else left to bury him. At the same farm, a piece of imported Rhenish pottery was uncovered.Land Under the Pole Star pg. 246-7  Modern Times  The modern settlement Alluitsup Paa in Vatnahverfi Throughout the former Eystribygg√∞and in Greenland, the old Norse place names have been largely replaced by Inuit ones, but \\"Vatnahverfi\\" is still widely used on current maps of the peninsula. Present-day settlements in the district include Alluitsup Paa on Agdluitsoq (Hrafnsfjord), Eqalugarssuit near Igaliku (Einarsfjord) and Saarloq on the southwest tip of the peninsula facing the Labrador Sea, reflecting the pattern of the Thule culture and the modern Greenlanders descended from them generally preferring the ocean-ends of the fjords rather than the inland heads. The part of Vatnahverfi most favoured by the Norse ‚Äì from Hafgrimsfjord to Austfjord ‚Äì is today called Tasikuluulik and though less populated it is still in use by modern Greenlanders, primarily for sheep farming and a bit of agriculture. In 2017, the Tasikuluulik portion of Vatnahverfi was one of five areas collectively called \\"Kujataa Greenland\\" named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, described as a place where \\"two cultures, European Norse and Inuit, created a cultural landscape based on farming, grazing and marine mammal hunting. The landscape represents the earliest introduction of farming to the Arctic, and the Norse expansion of settlement beyond Europe.\\"  Fictional Depiction  Jane Smiley‚Äôs 1988 novel The Greenlanders is set in 14th century Vatnahverfi, and incorporates some of Norse Greenland's historically known settlements, landmarks, events and people into the fictional plot. The Vatnahverfi farmers are portrayed as the colony's wealthiest and proudest inhabitants.

Arutz 7, Israel National Radio. July 17, 2002.  Early life  Gamliel Cohen in 1955 Cohen was born in Damascus, Syria, to a Jewish family. He moved to Israel in 1943, which was then controlled by the United Kingdom under the British Mandate.  Palmach  Cohen joined the Palmach in 1944.Palmach Information Center. He helped build the department of undercover soldiers known as DAWN. DAWN took advantage of the dark complexion of Israelis who had immigrated from Middle Eastern countries, as well as their familiarity with Islam and Arabic culture.Babel in Zion: Jews, Nationalism, and Language Diversity in Palestine, 920-1948. Liora R. Halperin, Yale University Press, Nov 28, 2014. In 1948, Cohen received documents which identified him as a Palestinian. He moved to Beirut using this false identity, and set up a textile shop which served as the front for his spying activities. Cohen gathered information about military installations and Lebanese war efforts against Israel, which he transmitted to his commanders by writing letters in code.  Mossad  Cohen joined Mossad shortly after the State of Israel was created. He worked under deep cover in France during the 1950s. Posing as a journalism student, he was hired as a clerk at the Syrian Embassy in Paris. Cohen's work took place prior to today's peace treaties and trade deals which Israel currently enjoys with several of its Arab neighbors. His job at the Syrian embassy provided him access to sensitive political and military documents, which he secretly photographed and sent the film to Israel. Gamliel and Aleeza Cohen in Rome  Family  In October 1954, Cohen married Aleeza Tahan, a young Israeli woman who had also been born in Damascus, Syria. Like her husband, Aleeza worked for Mossad in Europe, under the false identity of an immigrant from the Middle East. She served as a messenger, carrying documents from Cohen to another Mossad operative. Aleeza often lived in isolation, without social contact or communication with her family in Israel. The Cohens had two daughters while living abroad, and a third child was born in Israel.Aleeza Cohen, the Wife at his Side. Mican Veh Misham Magazine. September 2012. Volume 16. Aleeza Cohen in Vienna  Nazi Infiltration  In 1958, the Cohens moved to Austria. He worked as a journalist, writing articles that were published in various Arab-language newspapers. Cohen's alias as a reporter from the Middle East provided him access to several embassies in Europe, where he befriended diplomats and visited the home of the ambassador. Cohen penetrated neo-Nazi groups, which were of interest to his bosses in Israel during the 1950s and 1960s. In those years, Mossad was actively searching for war criminals who had committed atrocities during the Holocaust.  Final Years  Cohen completed active-duty Mossad service in 1964. Thereafter, he served as a trainer for the next generation of Israeli spies. As of 2016, 14 years after his death, Mossad cadets still study his trade craft, information-gathering techniques, and methods for developing contacts at high levels of foreign governments. Cohen spent his final years authoring the book, \\"Undercover: The Untold Story of the Palmach's Clandestine Arab Unit.\\" Cohen wrote the book in first person, analyzing his training and operations during the 1940s. It also discussed his personal relationships and work abroad during his Palmach service. While retired, Cohen gave an interview describing deep-cover activities as \\"your own, private battlefield.\\" Due to the inherently lonely nature of intelligence work, he stated, a covert operative must love his role and believe it is his destiny. When encountering trouble, the operative must be resourceful to find his own solution.  Death  Cohen died of natural causes, at age 80, in a Tel Aviv hospital. Historian Meir Pail stated, \\"Gamliel was known in the intelligence community as one of the most successful intelligence agents in Israeli history. The public never heard of him because he was never caught.\\" External links * Matti Friedman, Israel‚Äôs Secret Founding Fathers, New York Times, 1 March 2019 References Category:1922 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People of the Mossad Category:Israeli spies Category:Burials at Yarkon Cemetery ","title":"Gamliel Cohen"},{"id":"50544545","text":"Tilt-tray may refer to: *Tilt tray sorter *Tilt tray tow truck ","title":"Tilt tray"},{"id":"50544546","text":"MahƒÅlakadeva (died 1305 CE), also known as Mahlak Deo or Mahlak Deva, was a king of the Paramara dynasty in central India.

Gogadeva, also known as Haranand or simply Goga, was his powerful pradhan (prime minister). Goga was also the prime minister of Bhoja II's predecessor Arjuna II, and had turned against the king.

According to Amir Khusrow's Tarikh-i 'Alai, \\"Rai Mahlak Deo\\" and pradhan \\"Koka\\" (Goga) commanded a force of 30-40 thousand cavalry, and an infantry of unknown size. Khusrow states that Delhi's \\"army of Islam\\" defeated this Paramara force, and \\"the earth was moistened with Hindu blood\\". Goga was killed in the battle, and his head was sent to the Sultan in Delhi. Ayn al-Mulk Multani, the newly-appointed Governor of Malwa, was sent to expel Mahalakadeva from Mandu and cleanse that place from \\"the odour of infidelity\\". With help of a spy, Multani's forces found a way to enter the fort secretly. Mahalakadeva was killed while attempting to flee, on 24 November 1305. The Jain writer Kakka Suri, in his Nabhi-nandana-jinoddhara-prabandha (1336), describes the end of Mahalakadeva as follows: \\"Besieged by him [Alauddin] in his own fort, the ruler of MƒÅlwƒÅ passed there many days, living like a captive, and then died bereft of heroism.\\" It is not known when exactly did the Delhi forces completed their conquest of Malwa. A 1310 CE Udaipur inscription indicates that the Paramara dynasty survived until this time, at least in the north-eastern part of Malwa. A later 1338 CE inscription on a new mosque indicates that the area was under the control of the Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq by this time.

He previously played for the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League. Background Cogger was born in Greenacre, New South Wales, Australia. He is the son of former Western Suburbs Magpies player Trevor Cogger. Cogger played his junior rugby league for the Toukley Hawks, before being signed by the Newcastle Knights. Playing career =Early years= From 2014 to 2016, Cogger played for the Newcastle Knights' NYC team. In November and December 2014, he played for the Australian Schoolboys. On 21 January 2015, he re-signed with the Knights on a contract to the end of 2016. On 27 August 2015, he extended his Knights contract until the end of 2018. =2016= In 2016, Cogger captained the Knights' NYC side. In round 10 of the 2016 NRL season, he made his NRL debut for the Knights against the Cronulla- Sutherland Sharks. In July, he played for the New South Wales under-20s team against the Queensland under-20s team. He went on to play 6 NRL games in his debut season. =2017= After playing just one game for the Knights' Intrust Super Premiership NSW side, Cogger's 2017 season was derailed after having to undergo pelvis surgery. He made his return to the field in round 13 for the club's NYC side, while also playing two NRL matches at the end of the year. =2018= In January, Cogger signed a 2-year contract with the Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs starting in 2019, after his pathway to first-grade for the Knights was blocked through the signings of Mitchell Pearce and Connor Watson. Cogger played his final game for the Knights in his side's 12-24 loss to the St. George Illawarra Dragons in round 25. =2019= Cogger made a total of 17 appearances for Canterbury in the 2019 NRL season as the club finished 12th on the table. At one stage, Canterbury-Bankstown found themselves sitting last on the table and in real danger of finishing with the wooden spoon. However, for the third straight season, Canterbury achieved four upset victories in a row over Penrith, the Wests Tigers, South Sydney and Parramatta who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table. Pay was credited with the late season revival as the side focused heavily on defence. =2020= On 22 September, Cogger was informed by Canterbury that his services would not be required in 2021 and that he would be released at the end of the 2020 NRL season as the club looked to rebuild after a horror year on and off the field.

The bulletins are presented by Karl Lijnders and Madelaine Collignon, with meteorologist Elly Wicks as its weather presenter. Each region has its own reporter, such as Lismore's Phoebe Deas. Since the closure of the Tamworth studios in April 2015, the North West edition of the bulletin broadcasts live from Canberra. After being broadcast on television, the latest bulletins from each of the five regions become available to watch on their respective YouTube pages. In its website posted on 2 February 2017, Prime7 announced that the presentation of Northern NSW and Southern NSW local bulletins will be consolidated into a unified presentation format, known as Prime7 Local News, by 13 February, beginning with the introduction of dual presenter roles for Madelaine Collignon and Kenny Heatley (both of them began their career as the network's weather presenters), as well as Guy Fenton introduced as its interim weather presenter. This also comes after Southern NSW's final news presenter Freya Cole left Prime7 to contribute reports for Seven News. The 6.30pm national bulletin, however, remained under a single presenter format. More adjustments saw Lijnders, who was weatherzone.com.au's founding moderator and a former meteorologist at ABC News, replacing Fenton in presenting local weather forecasts from 20 March. Due to family reasons, Heatley resigned from Prime7 with his final television appearance occurred on 31 July 2018. Reporter and non-bulletin regional news updates presenter Liz Gwynn took over his place afterwards, making a dual-female presenter role with Collignon (a rare instance in Australian television news services). =Prime7 News at 6:30= Until 21 February 2014, Prime7 broadcasts a delayed Seven News into areas that receive full Prime7 Local News bulletins on weeknights. Since 24 February 2014, Prime7 has produced its own live bulletin due to the extension of Seven News to one hour on the eastern seaboard. This is presented by Daniel Gibson at 6:30pm (Liz Gwynn is fill-in presenter), and covers national and international news that are being broadcast by Seven News in its metropolitan counterparts. Resident meteorologist Karl Lijnders presents the expanded weather forecast, which features state, East Coast metropolitan cities and national weather. The statewide edition, however, does not cover across the entire New South Wales. Albury (which is served by sister station AMV in Victoria) does not receive this bulletin and continues to receive an edited version of Seven News Melbourne, which has been trimmed down to 30 minutes.

This, as well as the closure of bulletin by Southern Cross Ten in parts of Queensland and New South Wales, prompted an investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. New rules were later set out requiring regional stations to offer minimum levels of local content, over a six-week period. Two-minute news updates were introduced to Newcastle, Wollongong and Canberra in 2004. There are also updates presented for Western Victoria, Central Victoria and Gippsland.

It was released in 1983 under the Tone of Life imprint, and was later reissued in 2016 by Light in the Attic Records. The album - recorded in Cold Storage - combines post-punk and dub with a range of different stylistic influences from world music. Intended as a reaction against ‚Äúthe culture of death that was around‚Äù at the time, the album is also far more positive in comparison to Bullen's work with This Heat; its \\"koanic\\" and \\"ephemeral\\" lyrics subverting common linguistic cliches and tropes through repetition. Mostly ignored in 1983, the album would go on to become an expensive & \\"sought-after\\" collector's item in the decades following its release. It received far more attention upon being reissued, with most of it being very positive in nature. The album has additionally garnered praised from musicians such as David Grubbs and Daniel O'Sullivan. Background After This Heat disbanded in 1982, Bullen recruited Samuel (whom he'd met whilst buying a clarinet in a junk shop) from his own neighbourhood to record the 6 songs that would appear on the album at Cold Storage (the studio where his former band This Heat had recorded most of their material). The album was heavily influenced by the reggae and world music that was locally popular in Brixton at the time. Many listeners would later speculate that Bullen and Samuel were the same person, an idea that was refuted in the liner notes to the album's 2016 reissue. In fact, Samuel would later go on to record and release music of his own under the moniker \\"Dub Judah\\".  Content  Pitchfork described the album as \\"a strange amalgam of post-punk's desolation set to dub reggae's sunny lilt\\". The album also features influences from what would go on to be called \\"world music\\", like the track \\"Traveling\\" which \\"places a wild, Middle Eastern-tinged clarinet over a Greek bouzouki strummed with raga-like intensity, laying the path for globetrotting psychedelic punks like Sun City Girls.\\" A Popmatters review similarly noted that the track \\"Decide\\" \\"carries a distinctly Jamaican aroma but there‚Äôs as much Bali and Krautrock on the rest of the record as there is Rasta rock.\\" The closing track \\"Patience\\" earned comparisons to \\"Open Up The Gate\\" by The Congos for its \\"warm, melodic\\" intro \\"section that's dropped quickly.\\" The track \\"Good Side\\" has been described as being more rock- influenced, whilst reggae influences are more prominent on the title track. With Thatcherite politics and Reaganomics gaining momentum, the album - according to its liner notes - was intended as a reaction against ‚Äúthe culture of death that was around‚Äù at the time. As a result - in contrast to Bullen's darker and more paranoid work with This Heat - For a Reason has been described as being more \\"blissed-out\\", escapist, and \\"ephemeral\\"; its \\"koanic\\" lyrics \\"mainly consisting of \\"do unto others\\"-type fare.\\" Similar to This Heat's \\"Cenotaph\\" (off of their final album), the lyrics also consist of \\"[s]elf-help altruisms, textbook histories, [and] familiar parlance, repeated ad infinitum until the very fibre of each cliche becomes porous and their meanings subverted.\\"  Reception  =Initial= Released with little promotion from Bullen in 1983, the album \\"sank without a trace.\\" Bullen would subsequently disband Lifetones owing to a \\"complete lack of [public] interest.\\" It would, however, go on to become a \\"sought-after collector‚Äôs item that change[d] hands for hundreds of dollars a time\\" and \\"a holy grail for fans of weird, inventive and life-affirming music, a remarkable feat for an obscure one-off project.\\" =Retrospective= The album has received far more attention upon being reissued by Light in the Attic Records in 2016, most of which has been positive. Pitchfork wrote: \\"while it's not nearly as vital or serrated as This Heat's output, there's something enchanting about For a Reason.\\" AllMusic wrote that it \\"remains a unique, thrilling album\\". McDermott similarly wrote that even after 3 decades, \\"For A Reason retains its transportive [sic] magic.\\" Dusted wrote that the album \\"feels modest and yet complete in its representation of one man‚Äôs idiosyncratic embrace of the world he‚Äôd been given to live in.\\" Conversely, a mixed review came from Jedd Beaudoin of Spectrum Culture who found the album to be inconsistent, citing the tracks \\"Distance No Object\\" and \\"Patience\\" as being dated and monotonous respectively. However, he ends by conceding that the album \\"might [offer] a surprise or two for This Heat fans who thought they knew the whole story.\\" =Legacy= David Grubbs praised the title track as being \\"an earworm par excellence\\", and \\"thank\\"ed Bullen for it in an interview.

Tappan had married Mary Elizabeth Anderson on 26 June 1854; she was the daughter of Burrus's sister, Elizabeth (Burrus) and her husband Judge Samuel Anderson of Rutherford County, Tennessee. He assigned Nancy Burrus as a cook and the three sons as man servants to officers. Tappan fought in campaigns across Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. In 1865, at the end of the Civil War, the Burrus family was in Marshall, Texas with what remained of Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi. The Emancipation Proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln delivered the family into freedom. They made their way to Shreveport, Louisiana, then to New Orleans, and eventually to Memphis, Tennessee. In Memphis, James and John were able to find work. Before long the family moved to Nashville. In Nashville, James and John worked as wait staff in hotels and began to save for college. Training and education To increase his income, James Burrus began teaching in the primary and secondary schools in Goodlettsville, Tennessee and in Arkansas. In 1867, Burrus and his brother John enrolled as part of the first, four-person class at Fisk University. They pursued an academic, classical education. James was to study mathematics and John would study Greek.Editor. (1908). The American Missionary, Volumes 14‚Äì15. American Missionary Association. They needed preparatory classes to supplement their education. In 1875, Fisk University graduated James Burrus, John Houston Burrus, Virginia Eliza Walker and America W. Robinson as the first class of Fisk University. They were the first blacks or people of color to earn a bachelor's degree from a liberal arts college south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line.deGregory, Crystal A. (May 1999).

Graduate School, Vanderbilt University. Nashville, Tennessee. Fisk's faculty was then majority- white and most also served as missionaries. Recognizing James' promise, they tried to persuade him to enter the ministry. He chose mathematics instead, and the instructors encouraged Burrus to continue his studies. Robinson and Burrus were engaged for a short period, but during much of this time she was touring in Europe with the Fisk Jubilee Singers. They broke it off by 1878, and he never married. Robinson loaned Burrus money to attend graduate school at Dartmouth College, where he enrolled in 1877 to study mathematics. In 1879, he was awarded the Master of Arts in mathematics. This was the first instance of an African American to receive a master of arts degree in the United States.Taylor, A.A. (April 1954). \\"Fisk University and the Nashville Community, 1866‚Äì1900\\".

Professional career In May 1881, Burrus accepted an appointment at Fisk University as the first professor of mathematics. In 1882, he received an appointment at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College in Mississippi as professor of mathematics and superintendent of the college farm.Atwater, W.O. (March 1890).

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. Washington: Government Printing Office. Philanthropy Throughout his life, Burrus was a donor to Fisk University. Beginning around 1915, Burrus donated property worth $7,000 to Fisk University. In 1915, a gift of $600 was made. In 1917, James and Preston Burrus together made a contribution to Fisk in the amount of $112 to the Fisk Endowment Fund. An 85-acre farm was given to the school in 1922 by these two brothers. When Fisk University needed funds in 1926 to remove a debt, during a capital campaign the Burrus brothers donated $1,000. Upon James Burrus's death in 1928, his will stipulated that his estate be left to Fisk University. At the time of his death, his estate consisted of 85 houses, and stocks and bonds, valued at over $120,000.Palmer, Colin. (1999).

The dominant theme in her work is her native country, its topography and history of violence. Her work has traveled internationally and she has had many solo exhibitions. She studied photography at the University of Tehran and graduated with an M.A. in 2005. During her studies and throughout her life, she noticed the impact the Iran‚ÄìIraq War had on her country. Dashti's earlier work looks at the lasting effects of the war on the people and the land. In this way, she is considered to be a conflict photographer, but her work contrasts with the stark photojournalism that often is produced to represent the effect that war has on a country and its people. In 2017, her practice shifted slightly. Dashti began investigating the natural world. Though the subject matter differs from her earlier work, her practice at its core is still rooted in her country, its culture and her experiences within these.  Early life  Born in 1980 in Iran, Dashti grew up in Ahvaz, close to the Iran-Iraq border. Despite the Iran-Iraq War, Dashti's family decided to stay. There were many times that she and her family would go up on the roof when there was a pause in the fighting to collect spent bullets and were at constant risk of bombings. Her experiences in her childhood and her culture have heavily influenced the work she creates as an artist.Dashti, Gohar \\"Artist‚Äôs Concept Note.\\" Journal of Middle East Women's Studies, vol. 13 no. 1, 2017, pp. 141-141. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/648031.  Selected photography works  = Today's Life and War (2008) = Dashti's earlier and most well-known work is Today's Life and War which was featured in multiple exhibitions such as She Who Tells a Story: Women Photographers from Iran and the Arab World and Subtehran: Subjective Truth from Iran. In this work, Dashti is providing a new perspective on the Iran-Iraq War from the point of view of an Iranian woman and how civilians lives were affected by the war. The photographs don't only look at the violence and because of this, they defy the mainstream mass of images that depict Iran as a war-torn country. Often Dashti's work is seen as a new type of documentary style, one that breaks the norms and provides a story that the viewer can empathize with.Herd, Colin. \\"Dismantling Documentary.\\" Aesthetica, no. 69, Feb/Mar2016, pp. 24-29. http://www.aestheticamagazine.com/dismantling-documentary/ This work includes highly stylized staged settings that present a couple, a man and a woman, who are performing daily tasks or celebration but they are positioned amongst the detritus of war.Gresh, Kristen. \\"Gohar Dashti's Iran, Untitled.\\" Exposure (00988863), vol. 47, no. 2, Fall 2014, pp. 16-23. In one image, the couple is seated in a rusted, broken-down car, donning their wedding attire, with the lights of military vehicles in the background. This signifies how individuals are forced to put their life on pause in times of war.Chase, Alisia Grace. \\"She Who Tells a Story: Women Photographers from Iran and the Arab World.\\" Afterimage, vol. 41, no. 4, Jan/Feb2014, pp. 16-17. http://vsw.org/afterimage/issues/afterimage-vol-41-no-4/ Dashti explains that this work shows how war \\"permeates all aspects of contemporary society,\\". Blurring the line between fiction and reality she pulls these scenes from stories of Iran and her own experiences. Though the surrealist qualities in the work may first present the viewer with a whimsical scene, it is quickly influenced by the struggle and determination in the work which in turn rationalizes the images. The themes of borders and boundaries are evident in this work and stem from her life in Ahvaz since it is a border community and she was forced to be close to the conflict, being subjected to bombings almost daily. Dashti examines the impacts that war has on people's lives including the emotional labor and psychological burdens that are caused. This work allows an alternative perspective to that of mainstream photojournalism of Iran, and Dashti intends the images to be relatable and from an influential perspective that reaches individuals who haven't experienced this type of adversity. = Iran, Untitled (2013) and Stateless (2014) = Like her previous work, this photography is also situated within conversations of how war affects people and broadens her scope to larger populations and how the war affected Iran as a whole. Though shot at separate times, they deal with similar concepts. The photographs are staged and Dashti makes no effort to hide this with the use of surrealist tendencies in the work or the use of props, including a mattress, a slide, or a bathtub in desert landscapes. The contradictions between action and pause reflect the modern society Dashti inhabits, and how society in Iran has not found a balance. With this sense of action also comes ideas of location, Dashti is making it evident that the desert represented in these images is not an empty space and neither is the country of Iran.  Home (2017)  This series looks at how nature enters the abandoned homes of Iran, both symbolically and physically. Dashti is commenting on the relationship between nature and humans and how they intersect within lived spaces. The spaces depicted in these digital photographs were once inhabited by citizens who left the country and all evidence of the lives they once lived there are buried. The images depict the taking over of the structures by the plants, and like most of her other work, they are staged. Dashti wants the viewer to consider how humans interact with nature and acknowledge the strength it has.Harrison, Alice. \\"The Fate of Abandoned Iranian Homes\\" Ignant. Feb. 21, 2018. Accessed Mar. 23 2018. Through her observations of the land that had been emptied by the war in Iran, she wanted to highlight the tenacity of nature after witnessing a fern growing up from the cracks of one of these homes. Dashti commented saying, \\"It had the power to stay there. Left alone, it would eventually consume and conquer their home.\\" The work combines \\"the personal, the political and the botanical\\" and shows how people can come and go, but the land that humans inhabit will always be there, evolving as humans interact with it in various ways. In creating this work, it made her wonder why her parents had chosen not to flee Iran during the war. Upon asking her father, his response was a concern of protecting his loved ones. He had wanted the family to stick together and because of this, families like hers who stayed were able to help restore the community after the war ended. This series reflects the histories of Iranian families during the time of the war and its physical impacts.  Still Life (2017)  Dashti used cameraless photography techniques such as cyanotypes and photograms to create plant imagery in this work. Unlike most of her work, she moves heavily into abstraction in Still Life and closes in on her organic subject matter. By composing the plants often in disarray, she wants the viewer to be intrigued by the imagery and notice their strangeness because of the fact the plants are decontextualized. Due to the tight framing, the viewer can examine the ways in which Dashti has manipulated the subject matter. The images highlight the textures of the plant material and reveal their repetitive nature and patternings. Often smashing and breaking the material before photographing it, Dashti comments on the beauty of the natural world while also acknowledging the damaging effects humans can have on it. Even though the original images are made in a way that is very hands-on, she alters the prints further by enlarging them and reproducing them digitally which adds to the mechanical and organic relationship in the work.  Alien (2017)  Taking a slightly different turn from previous work, Dashti utilized an instant camera to produce work depicting the forests of New Hampshire. Unlike most landscape photography, this work embraces the imperfections of the medium. They are small in size with an offset border, referencing the Polaroid format. By placing a glass plate in every image, the flash of Dashti's camera is recorded. By adding in this element, Dashti places herself and the viewer in a distanced position from the subject matter and produces a voyeuristic effect. In doing this, she also makes it evident that she is a visitor in the setting. For the first time the landscape of Iran is removed from her subject matter and she is separate from her homeland. The naturally lit spaces oppose the artificial flash in every scene, perhaps signifying the displaced feeling that Dashti has in being in a foreign place. The combination of the light, subject matter, and medium create an uncommon quality to the images and Dashti intends for the photographs to place the viewer into a state of instability.

He succeeded Arjuna II as the king of Dhara in Malwa region. According to Hammira Mahakavya, written by the Jain poet Nayachandra Suri, the Chahmana ruler Hammira defeated Arjuna of Sarasapura and Bhoja of Dhara. Based on this, R. C. Majumdar concluded that Hammira must have invaded Malwa twice: once during the reign of Arjuna II, and again, during the reign of Bhoja II. Because Hammira ascended the Chauhan throne during 1282-83, Bhoja must have ascended the Paramara throne sometime after 1283 CE. Pratipal Bhatia, on the other hand, speculates that Arjuna II's minister Goga-deva rebelled against him, and put Bhoja II on the throne of Dhara as a titular king. The 16th-century historian Firishta describes Goga as the \\"Raja of Malwa\\". According to Bhatia's theory, Goga-deva became the de facto independent ruler of one part of the Paramara kingdom, while Arjuna II continued to control another part.

Lei was detained on suspicion of soliciting prostitution at a foot parlor. After being taken to a police vehicle, Lei fell ill and was sent to a hospital, where he died later that night. The unclear circumstances surrounding his death led to accusations of police brutality, leading law enforcement officials to provide a description of events on state television. An online petition launched by students of Renmin University, Lei's alma mater, questioned various elements of the police's account, and called for an investigation into his death. Background =Lei Yang= Lei Yang was a native of Hunan Province in central China. In 2009, he graduated from Renmin University with a degree in environmental science. His wife had recently given birth to a child, and Lei celebrated his three-year anniversary three weeks prior to his death. At the time of his death, he was 29, and worked for the China Association of Circular Economy, an environmental organization with ties to the government. =Police investigation into foot massage parlor= At 8:00 PM on May 7, Changping police received reports claiming that a foot massage parlor was running a prostitution business. \\"Foot massage parlor\\", according to the New York Times, is a popular Chinese euphemism for brothels. Initiating a probe into the parlor, the police arrived at 8:40. On their Sina Weibo microblog, the police said they had arrested six individuals (including Lei). =Timeline of encounter with police and death= Between 8:30 and 9:00 PM on May 7, 2016, Lei left home to pick up his relatives from the airport; at 9:00 PM, he told his father-in-law he would take the subway to the airport. A statement by Changping police said officers saw Lei leaving the massage parlor at 9:14 PM, and detained him on suspicion of soliciting prostitution. Police described Lei as violently uncooperative, biting an officer and attempting to run away, destroying a handheld police camera. Lei was restrained and put in a police vehicle, where he escaped by moving towards the front seat and opening the car door. At 9:45, Lei was caught and handcuffed. Lei began to complain of illness, and was taken to a nearby hospital at 10:05 PM. Early reports described Lei as dead on arrival, though he was officially declared dead at 10:55 PM, according to later police accounts. Once the plane arrived at 11:30, Lei's wife attempted to contact him multiple times via mobile phone. At 1:00 AM, a police officer answered, urging her to come to the police station. Lei's family was allowed to see the body at 4:30 AM, but were prevented from taking photographs of the body, which they say was covered in multiple bruises and injuries. =Aftermath, police reactions and trial= On May 13, the police officer leading the operation on the parlor appeared on Chinese Central Television, stating the operation was conducted \\"according to the relevant laws and regulations\\". Police denied accusations of police brutality, and stated they had found a condom on the scene which contained Lei's DNA. A worker at the parlor said she had performed a sex act on Lei in exchange for 200 yuan ($ USD). An autopsy was conducted from May 13 to 14, overseen by a forensic medical expert at the family's request. Medical experts, lawyers and prosecutors observed the trial, though police officers were excluded to avoid perceptions of a conflict of interest. On May 14, Beijing authorities promised they would release the results of the autopsy as well as surveillance footage. According to Chinese prosecutors, Lei's family had appointed an unnamed third party to conduct the investigation. Five lawyers were appointed to represent Lei in an upcoming trial. Xinhua reported that prosecutors had stated they were conducting interviews of Lei's family, witnesses, and police officers involved in Lei's case. Beijing police announced a zero-tolerance policy if misconduct was found to be a factor in Lei's death. A statement circulating online, reportedly from Wu Wencui, Lei's wife, announced she was suing the police department for \\"intentional injury resulting in death\\". On June 1, the prosecution department of Changping announced they would investigate the role five police officers in the death of Lei Yang. On June 30, an independent autopsy found that Lei Yang apparently choked to death by the Beijing People's Procuratorate's statement. On December 23, the People's Procuratorate of Fengtai District of Beijing determined that the five police officers did not perform their duties properly, behaved inappropriately during the incident, deliberately fabricated facts, and obstructed the investigation. However, it also determined that the crime was \\"minor\\" and decided not to prosecute the officers involved. Public response Reports of Lei's death were widely discussed and shared on the Internet. Professor Zhang Jiang of the Beijing Foreign Studies University said the reports highlighted discontent regarding abuses of power by police, leveraging fears about personal security of the middle-class. Four petitions, claimed to be from various groups of alumni at Lei's alma mater, Renmin University. Some links to these petitions were deleted by Chinese censors. Beijing News reported it had confirmed the authenticity of one such petition, written by 1988 graduates of Renmin. The petition, named \\"We Must Speak Out ‚Äî Statement by Some 1988 Alumni of Renmin University of China on Fellow Student Lei Yang‚Äôs Death\\", appeared on a Baidu website on May 12, but was deleted as the day progressed. Li Jianjun, a former investigative journalist, questioned the police's account, stating that Lei did not fit the profile of those caught in raids on brothels, and would not have had time to visit prostitutes.

Biography Fradl Shtok was born in the shtetl, or small town, of Skala, in eastern Galicia, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today in Ukraine). Her mother died when she was one year old, and her father went to prison a few years later, for his part in the murder of a man during a brawl; after that she was raised by an aunt. Shtok was a talented student, played the violin, and could recite from the works of the classic German poets Goethe and Schiller.\\"Shtok, Fradl\\" (1981).

In 1907, she immigrated to the United States, settling in New York City. Beginning in 1910, she published poems and stories in Yiddish periodicals and anthologies, mostly in publications of the literary group known as Di Yunge. In 1914, Shtok was among a group of writers led by Joseph Opatoshu, who broke away from Di Yunge out of a philosophic disagreement, and published their own anthology, Di naye heym (The new home), edited by Opatoshu; not satisfied with their colleagues' emphasis on literary playfulness, the writers of Di naye heym were interested in exploring the ties between their own milieu and the past generation.Opatoshu, Joseph. \\"Yiddish Literature in the United States.\\" Translated by Shlomo Noble.

Later Leivick and Boraisho joined us.\\" The anthology included a cycle of eight sonnets by Shtok. Shtok was recognized in her own time and later as a significant lyric voice in Yiddish. Jacob Glatstein wrote appreciatively in retrospect: \\"Her poetry is elegant, original ... masterful ... capable of inscribing a beautiful chapter into Yiddish poetry\\".Quoted in English translation from the Yiddish, in: \\"Fradel Schtok\\" [author biography], in Frieda Forman et al. (Eds.), Found Treasures: Stories by Yiddish Women Writers. Toronto: Second Story Press, 1994. p. 363‚Äì364. In an analysis of two major anthologies of Yiddish poetry published in the early 20th century, the scholar Kathryn Hellerstein notes that \\"Shtok stands out as an innovator in verse forms, enriching the meters and stanzas of Yiddish poetry.\\"Hellerstein, Kathryn (2014). A Question of Tradition: Women Poets in Yiddish, 1586‚Äì1987. Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 38. In Moyshe Bassin's anthology of Yiddish poetry over five centuries (Finf hundert yor yidishe poezye; 1917), volume two (covering the modern period), which included only a narrow selection of female poets (nine of the total 95 poets), Shtok was by far the best represented.Hellerstein (2014), p. 33‚Äì34. Eleven of her poems were included, compared to no more than three each from the other female poets. A generous selection of Shtok's poems also appeared in Ezra Korman's 1928 anthology of Yiddish poetry by women from the 16th century to the contemporary era (Yidishe dikhterins), which included 70 women poets.Hellerstein (2014), p. 34. Shtok was represented with 12 poems. Hellerstein further observes: \\"The one poet that both Bassin and Korman present amply is Fradl Shtok\\" (p. 37). In 1919, Fradl Shtok published a collection of 38 stories, Gezamelte ertsehlungen. Most of the stories are set in a shtetl that resembles, or, in some instances, is directly or indirectly identified as her hometown Skala, while ten stories take place in a Jewish immigrant milieu in the United States. Contemporary reviews of the book were mixed, with one or two striking a particularly negative tone.\\"Fradl Shtok\\" [author biography]. In: Jewish American Literature: A Norton Anthology. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2001. Edited by Jules Chametzky, et al. . p. 290‚Äì291. Subsequently, Shtok withdrew from the Yiddish literary scene. In 1927 she published a novel in English, Musicians Only, which received no attention from critics in either English or Yiddish. In 1942 Shtok was in contact with Abraham Cahan, editor of the Yiddish newspaper Forverts (The Forward), and he received from her a new story in Yiddish, \\"A soycher fun fel\\" (A fur merchant), which appeared in the newspaper on November 19, 1942.Neugroschel, Joachim. \\"Fradel Shtok\\" [translator's note].

Neugroschel was apparently the first to call attention to the existence of Shtok's correspondence with Cahan; previously she had often been reported to have probably died in the 1930s. Her correspondence with Cahan indicated that she was at that time going by the name of Frances Zinn, and was living in California. She likely died in the Hollywood, California, in 1952.Hellerstein (2014), p. 431‚Äì432, note 50. Publications Books * 1919: Gezamelte ertsehlungen [stories].

A former member of the Eurosceptic right-wing populist UK Independence Party (UKIP), he was one of its unsuccessful candidates for the South West England constituency in the 2019 European Parliament election. During the Gamergate controversy, Benjamin promoted a conspiracy theory that feminists were infiltrating video game research groups to influence game development according to a feminist agenda. Since Gamergate, his commentary has been largely devoted to promoting Brexit, and criticising feminism, Islam, identity politics, and what he views as political correctness in the media and other institutions. In 2016, in response to politician Jess Phillips' complaint that she frequently received rape threats from men online, Benjamin tweeted to her: \\"I wouldn't even rape you.\\" Criticism of this comment‚Äîand a later remark in which Benjamin said he might rape Phillips but for the fact that \\"nobody's got that much beer\\"‚Äîdominated press coverage of his European Parliament candidacy.  YouTube career  Benjamin's YouTube channel drew attention during the Gamergate controversy in 2014. Inside Higher Ed said his videos on the topic advanced a conspiracy theory in which he argued members of the Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) were actively plotting to influence video game development, saying DiGRA \\"became co-opted by feminists to become a think tank by which gender ideologues can disseminate their ideology to the gaming press and ultimately to gamers.\\" In June 2015, YouTube took down one of Benjamin's videos when it received a copyright claim from The Guardian. Benjamin contested the claim against the video which used substantial portions of The Guardians video. The Guardian said it was offering \\"advice on how to engage with Guardian content without breaching copyright.\\" The video was restored later the same day. One Los Angeles Times opinion columnist wrote of the incident calling it \\"alarming to see copyright law used to stifle debate in the public square.\\" At VidCon 2017, media critic Anita Sarkeesian appeared on a panel discussing online harassment directed towards women. A group of YouTubers who had frequently criticised Sarkeesian in the past, including Benjamin, filled one half of the first three rows of the audience and filmed Sarkeesian as part of a targeted harassment campaign against her. Sarkeesian singled out Benjamin as a serial harasser of hers, calling him a \\"garbage human.\\" VidCon founder Hank Green issued a statement that the group's actions were clear \\"intimidating behaviour\\" and apologised for the situation \\"which resulted in [Sarkeesian] being subjected to a hostile environment that she had not signed up for.\\" Benjamin later said he was not present with the intention of harassing Sarkeesian, stating he would like to know how she \\"would like to be approached.\\" Patreon also investigated the claims of harassment, but determined that although they considered his actions \\"distasteful\\", Benjamin had not violated their code of conduct. Patreon banned Benjamin in December 2018, when he was earning over US$12,000 a month. According to Patreon, Benjamin violated the site's rules on hate speech by using \\"racial and homophobic slurs to degrade another individual.\\" A number of users, including Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, and Dave Rubin left the platform following the ban of Benjamin, with Benjamin and Rubin moving over to Peterson's Thinkspot. Harris stated that he did not \\"share the politics of the banned members,\\" but objected to what he described as \\"political bias\\" on Patreon. As part of their explanation for why they dropped Benjamin, Patreon published a transcript of a YouTube video in which Benjamin stated that members of the alt-right were \\"acting like white niggers\\" because \\"[e]xactly how you describe black people acting is the impression I get dealing with the Alt-Right.\\" He added that: \\"White people are meant to be polite and respectful to one another.\\" Later in the video, Benjamin stated: \\"don‚Äôt expect me to have a debate with one of your faggots.\\" In response, Benjamin has said that his targets were not black or homosexual, and he claimed that the word \\"nigger\\" is not offensive in Britain as it is in the United States. Benjamin also claimed that the comments had been taken out of context. = Copyright lawsuit = On 25 August 2017, comedian, YouTuber and podcaster Akilah Hughes filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement against Benjamin for using of portions of her 28 November 2016 video We Thought She Would Win in his video SJW Levels of Awareness. On 3 February 2020, the case was dismissed with prejudice and on 5 August 2020 she was directed to pay Benjamin's $39,911.89 USD legal fees with Judge Richard J. Sullivan writing, in part, \\"Hughes‚Äôs claims were objectively unreasonable ‚Äì a fact that was clear from the face of the complaint and the videos at the heart of the dispute\\" and \\"Hughes‚Äô public comments reveal an intent to abuse the legal system in order to further a personal agenda that had little to do with the Copyright Act.\\"  Political career  In March 2018, North London Antifa protesters broke into a scheduled discussion between Benjamin and Yaron Brook by King's College London's Libertarian Society at the school. Masked protestors attacked security guards, set off smoke bombs, broke windows, set off a fire alarm, and allegedly attacked other attendees. The event organisers called the police, cancelled the event and evacuated the building. The organiser reported that two security guards were hospitalised. In May 2018, Benjamin was a speaker at a right-wing \\"Day of Freedom\\" rally in support of Tommy Robinson after Robinson was banned from Twitter for hate speech. In June 2018, Benjamin joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP), along with YouTuber Mark Meechan, better known by his online name Count Dankula, and far-right conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson. The trio's membership has been described by political analysts as part of a shift to the far-right in UKIP under Gerard Batten's leadership. In the European Parliament's 2019 elections in the United Kingdom, Benjamin was second on UKIP's list for the South West England constituency. Benjamin was not elected, with his party getting only 3.22% of the vote in his native South West England constituency (a drop of 29.1% from 2014) and losing both of its seats in the region, as well as all twenty-two of its seats across the rest of Britain. =Rape comments= In response to Labour Party politician and Member of Parliament Jess Phillips' statement that rape threats are commonplace for her, Benjamin said in May 2016, \\"I wouldn't even rape you #AntiRapeThreats #FeminismIsCancer\\" in a YouTube video and repeated this on Twitter. He has declined to apologise for the comment. He was investigated by West Midlands Police for the comment and a police spokesperson said he was \\"dealt with by way of words of advice\\". At a UKIP press conference announcing his candidacy for the 2019 European Parliament election, Benjamin once again refused to retract his comments about Phillips, and said she was being a \\"giant bitch\\" by \\"laughing about male suicide\\" and so he was justified in being a \\"giant dick back.\\" It was unclear what Benjamin's comments referred to; Phillips had critiqued the idea of a \\"men's day\\" but said that male suicide is a serious issue. The chairman of the Swindon branch of UKIP called for Benjamin to be deselected, which was rejected by Batten. Later in the campaign, he made additional negative comments about Phillips, saying he might rape her but \\"nobody's got that much beer\\". He said this was a joke and was empowering to victims of rape because \\"it's a lot more empowering to not be controlled by jokes\\". The University of the West of England cancelled a hustings event for fears of disturbances and Exeter Cathedral banned him a few days later from a separate election event it was hosting.  Political views  Benjamin is anti-feminist, and critical of identity politics. He has opposed online feminist movements such as the British group Reclaim the Internet, which he called \\"social communism.\\" Following the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Benjamin said that social justice feminism was a \\"disease of the modern age\\" that had disenfranchised and radicalised young men causing a rise in the number of mass murders. While on a panel in New York City in 2018, he said: \\"Jewish people, unfortunately for them, have got to drop the identity politics. I'm sorry about the Holocaust but I don't give a shit. I'm sorry.\\" Vice has criticised Benjamin for a \\"sense of purist thinking and a logic-before-all attitude\\" that ignores the complexity of topics related to race and gender. The Spectator has described his views and public career as \\"Benjamin isn‚Äôt even right wing but a leftist libertarian whose schtick is simply to question the received wisdoms of our time.\\" News outlets and journalists have described Benjamin as right-wing and far-right. Vox has described him as anti-progressive. He has been described as alt-right by The Times and The Jewish Chronicle, and he has been linked to the alt-right by other news media and researchers, including Newsweek, Salon, The Guardian, Vice, and Data & Society. The Daily Dot compared Benjamin to the alt-right due to his anti-feminism and criticisms of Islam and Black Lives Matter, frequent subjects for criticism by the alt-right. Vice and PC Magazine have described him as a conspiracy theorist. Benjamin has described himself as a \\"classical liberal\\" and has said that he opposes the alt-right. He has argued that the alt-right's authoritarian and collectivist thinking is a reaction to comparable racism against white people from the left. He is an advocate for Brexit.  Personal life  The son of a sergeant in the Royal Air Force, Benjamin is married and has two children. He lives with his family in Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom.

Joan of Arc convinced the Dauphin Charles to go to be crowned at Reims. The march though the heart of territory controlled by the hostile Burgundians was successful and would give the throne of the French monarchy to Charles VII, who had been ousted therefrom by the Treaty of Troyes. Background  Main article: Treaty of Troyes and Joan of Arc . Since the Treaty of Troyes in 1420, the dauphin had been disinherited in favour of Henry V of England following the assassination of John the Fearless. The former married the daughter of King Charles VI of France, and his son Henry VI was to be his successor on the thrones of France and England. But Henry V died in 1422 and his son was not yet one year old; the regency was entrusted to John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford. The intervention of Joan of Arc with the Dauphin Charles would be seen as miraculous, even more so after the lifting of the Siege of Orl√©ans and the Battle of Patay. upright=1.3thumb1415‚Äì1429 March to Reims  For the first time in the history of France, the king did not let the crown pass to his eldest son. Charles VI of France disinherited his son, leaving the kingdom of France to Henry VI of England, who was the son of his daughter Catherine. After Charles VI died, his son challenged his disinheritance and claimed the throne. Despite the French victory in the Battle of Patay on June 18, which caused the decline of the English in Paris, the dauphin Charles VII refused to continue to Reims, which was in the hands of the Burgundians, remaining in Sully-sur-Loire and withdrew his army to Orl√©ans to be crowned there as was Louis VI; Nevertheless, a coronation in Reims would have a much greater impact because it would be seen as a new miracle, attesting to his divine legitimacy. After initially meeting the Dauphin on May 23, 1429 at the Royal City of Loches, Joan of Arc next met him again on June 21 at four o'clock in the Fleury Abbey to persuade him to go to Reims. The next day, the dauphin's council met in Chateauneuf-sur-Loire and ordered the army to gather at Gien. Joan of Arc chasing of prostitutes On June 24, preceded by her page, Louis de Coutes, who held her banner emblazoned \\"Jhesus Maria,\\" Joan of Arc ‚Äî arriving at Gien with her armor forged in Tours, her armor and sword of Fierbois ‚Äî found Charles VII. The next day the king's army gathered in Gien. The French army took Bonny-sur-Loire and Saint-Fargeau. Joan of Arc broke her sword on the back of a prostitute who followed the army, and two days later the Dauphin finally ordered the march to the city of the coronation: the march began at Gien on June 29, 1429. The ease of the march showed both the fragility of the Anglo-Burgundian rule and the restoration of confidence in the cause of Charles VII of France. According to Jean de Dunois the bluff was the only tactic that opened the gates of the city. The Marshal of France, Gilles de Rais, rode to Reims, hoping to use this victorious march to retrieve a ransom of land taken from \\"collaborators.\\" Joan of Arc was escorted from Gien by her captains: Tugdual Kermoysan, La Hire, Andr√© of Loh√©ac, Pierre Rieux, Jean V de Bueil, Pierre Bessonneau, Jacques de Chabannes, Jacques Dinan, and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles. On the road to Reims, the Constable de Richemont sent Pierre Rostrenen to ask leave of the dauphin to serve at his coronation. Rostrenen accompanied the constable to Parthenay. During the march, the Burgundian garrison located in Auxerre refused to open its gates. Georges de la Tr√©moille was given two thousand gold √©cus by the minister of the city, for the city to remain neutral and allow the French army to resupply itself and to camp outside its walls (on July 1 and 2). The army of the Dauphin left again; Saint-Florentin submitted immediately, as did Brienon l‚ÄôArchev√™que ‚Äî on July 4, the army reached Troyes, five to six percent of whose occupants were Burgundians, who refused to open the gates. Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The citizens of Troyes hand over city keys to the Dauphin and Joan of Arc. After four days of siege, the majority of the dauphin's council wanted to lift the siege and continue on the road without entering the city. On the fifth day of the siege, July 9, Troyes capitulated (for fear of attack), but only Charles VII and the captains were able to enter. The soldiers spent the night in Saint-Phal, under the command of Ambroise de Lor√©. Gilles de Rais was one of the leaders of the army who reduced Troyes to obedience. Fewer than 2000 English soldiers of the captain of Paris, John of Lancaster occupied Paris, which had as its provost Simon Morhier, and as Governor Jean de La Baume. Philip the Good of Burgundy opted to leave Laon for Paris, where he arrived on July 10, appointed the Master of the Louvre Jean de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam governor, and committed to him the safety of Paris in the absence of Lancaster. Philip sent ambassadors to the Dauphin Charles VII to sue for peace. On July 11, the Dauphin's army left Troyes for the first time to head to Chalons-en-Champagne, which opened its gates on July 14 to let him spend the night. On Saturday, July 16, in the morning, Philip the Good left Paris to return to Laon, while the Archbishop of Reims, Renault Chartres, left Reims in the hands of William, Lord of Ch√¢tillon-sur-Marne and of the Sire de Saveuses; the dauphin arrived at the castle of the Archbishop of Reims in Sept-Saulx (located 21 km from Reims). The dauphin summoned the people of Reims to open their gates, despite their vow to resist him for six weeks until the arrival of relief by Lancaster and Philip the Good. After negotiations and dinner, Charles VII entered and slept in Reims. That same day, Ren√© of Anjou brought the homage of Lorraine and Barrois to the Dauphin. Consequences  On Sunday, July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned King of France in Reims: he received the Holy Ampulla from the hands of the Archbishop Renault Chartres. \\"Noble King, now is executed the pleasure of God who wished I lift the siege of Orl√©ans, and I bring you into this city of Rheims to receive your holy coronation to show you are the true king, and the one to whom the kingdom of France must belong,\\" declared Joan of Arc, paying tribute to her king. The coronation ceremony, given the circumstances, took place in simplicity, because the crown, the scepter, and the globe, were still in Saint-Denis, which was controlled by the English; among the peers, only three of the spiritual peers attended the ceremony: the Archbishop of Reims Renault Chartres, the Bishop of Laon William of Champeaux, the bishop of Chalons Jean Saarbr√ºcken. But the essential rite was performed: the eighth sacrament (anointing of the king), which makes kings and which marks the sacred sign of legitimate power, was then given to Charles VII, making him the rightful monarch, representing the House of Valois, authentically appointed by God, against John of Lancaster, whom enemy arms had imposed, and against the irresponsible signature of a mad king. Commemoration For the fifth centennial of the campaign, and in the context of the canonization of Joan of Arc, a series of plaques was mounted on the route that Joan followed to retake Reims and crown the king.

The film explores the 25-year history of AYO and its origins whilst focusing on the friendships and deep bonds created between current members to further highlight the theme of peace through music. The film premiered in Hong Kong cinemas on 17 July 2016.  Synopsis  In Search of Perfect Consonance profiles the Asian Youth Orchestra from its establishment in 1987 to its 25th anniversary in 2016. China and Vietnam were engaged in a long and violent border war, relations between China and Japan were frosty with tensions running high across the Strait of Taiwan. These events inspired Richard Pontzious to establish the Asian Youth Orchestra in Hong Kong with the support of world renowned musicians such as the great violinist Yehudi Menuhin who eventually became co founder and conducted the first concerts in 1990. From its humble beginnings the orchestra aimed to connect the region's aspiring young musicians in a bid to promote peace through music and has trained more than 2,000 musicians from across Asia throughout its 25-year history.Synopsis  www.consonance-movie.com, retrieved 2016-05-30 The film follows today's young musicians from Asian Youth Orchestra during an intense summer program of rehearsals and a three-week concert tour of Asia. Selected from thousands of applicants across the region the students overcame national and cultural differences learnt to listen and work with their fellow musicians allowing them to reconnect with their shared passion for music, a passion that not only allows their talents to bloom, but also creates deep bonds between them. The close bonds between musicians are at the heart of the Asian Youth Orchestra and forms the basis of the story explored in the film whilst delving into the origins and inspirations behind the creation of the Asian Youth Orchestra with a hope of uniting Asia through a common passion for classical music. Therefore, it seems appropriate that the piece being prepared by the young orchestra for their three-week concert tour is nothing less than the last movement of Beethoven's 9th. One that emphasizes brotherhood and, as young Taiwanese bass trombonist Shao Hua Wu says, is ‚Äúfull of hope‚Äù.  Production  Filming took place in the summer of 2015, commencing in June and concluded in the middle of August. Majority of filming took place in Hong Kong at multiple locations such as the Hong Kong Colliseum, the Peak and the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts. Additional footage was filmed at the Tokyo City Concert Hall during the final performance of their three-week concert tour of Asia.  Additional Information  = About the director and producer = Director Ruby Yang's recent works have mainly focused on social issues in mainland China, such as The Blood of Yingzhou District, which won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject and The Warriors of Qiugang, which was nominated Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject in 2011. Yang also directed and produced My Voice, My Life, a feature-length documentary that opened in 13 theatres across Hong Kong and Macau. The Wall Street Journal named it \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs five most-notable films of 2014. It won the 2015 NPT Human Spirit Award at the Nashville Film Festival and was selected by film critic societies from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China as \\"one of the ten best Chinese-language films of 2014\\". = About the Asian Youth Orchestra = Set up in 1987, the Asian Youth Orchestra is the brainchild of artistic director Richard Pontzious who's vision was to create an orchestra that united the region whilst celebrating the excellence of aspiring Asian musicians. The orchestra quickly gathered support from distinguished musicians across the globe including violinist Yehudi Menuhin and played its very first concert at the Kumamoto Music Festival in Japan in 1990. Each year, thousands of aspiring musicians from across Asia audition for a place in the orchestra and over its rich 25-year history, the Asian Youth Orchestra has 2000 young musicians with many having successful careers in music and becoming messengers of peace in Asia. Since its inception the Asian youth Orchestra has given more than 350 performances in some of the world's top venues, reaching over a million concertgoers.

It was founded by Frank Spedding from Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa as an offshoot of the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago devoted to chemistry and metallurgy, but became a separate project in its own right. The Ames Project developed the Ames Process, a method for preparing pure uranium metal that the Manhattan Project needed for its atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. Between 1942 and 1945, it produced over of uranium metal. It also developed methods of preparing and casting thorium, cerium and beryllium. In October 1945 Iowa State College received the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for Excellence in Production, an award usually only given to industrial organizations. In 1947 it became the Ames Laboratory, a national laboratory under the Atomic Energy Commission. Background The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up the possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. On 20 December 1941, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, the objective of which was to produce reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate plutonium from the uranium, and ultimately to design and build an atomic bomb. This became the Manhattan Project. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts. Compton established the project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in February 1942. Its mission was to build nuclear reactors to create plutonium that would be used in atomic bombs. For advice on assembling the laboratory's Chemistry Division, Compton, a physicist, turned to Herbert McCoy, who had considerable experience with isotopes and radioactive elements. McCoy recommended Frank Spedding from Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, as an expert on the rare-earth elements, which were chemically similar to the actinide series that included uranium and plutonium. Compton asked Spedding to become the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's Chemistry Division. Owing to a lack of space at the University of Chicago, Spedding proposed to organize part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College, where he had colleagues who were willing to help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this never happened. The success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project. Organization Spedding started by recruiting two fellow scientists at Iowa State College to become his associate directors; Harley A. Wilhelm, an expert in spectrochemistry and metallurgy, as the head of the Ames Project's Metallurgy Division, and Iral B. Johns as the head of the Plutonium Division. Under them were eight section chiefs. The Ames Project grew to over 90 scientific staff. The total number of staff eventually exceeded 500. Senior staff would meet on Sunday mornings to review the previous week's work and set goals for the week ahead, a process that came to be called \\"Speddinars\\". At first Spedding had to depart for Chicago soon after each meeting, but in early 1943 he was succeeded as head of the chemistry division at the Metallurgical Laboratory by James Franck, allowing Spedding to spend more time at Ames. He remained an associate director at the Metallurgical Laboratory. Spedding was fortunate in having the full support of Charles E. Friley, the president of Iowa State College, even though the nature of the work could not at first be disclosed to him while security checks were being undertaken. Once these were completed, Friley brought in Harold V. Gaskill, the Dean of Science, as the Ames Project's administrator. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took control of the Manhattan Project in June 1942, and the Ames Project in late 1942. Uranium =Ames Process= The first item on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. Uranium ore was readily available. Some of high-grade ore from the Belgian Congo was in storage in a warehouse at Port Richmond on Staten Island. About per annum was being mined at the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium on the Great Bear Lake near the Arctic Circle in Canada's Northwest Territories. The Eldorado company also operated a refinery at Port Hope, Ontario, where Canadian and Belgian ore was refined. The Manhattan Project's estimated requirements for 1942 were , of which Compton required just for his proposed nuclear reactor. The major problem was impurities in the uranium oxide, which could act as neutron poisons and prevent a nuclear chain reaction. Due to the presence of impurities, references published before 1942 typically listed its melting point at around when pure uranium metal actually melts at . Peter P. Alexander, at Metal Hydrides Incorporated, gave in 1938 the first indications that the melting point of uranium was \\"as low as and even somewhat lower\\". The most effective way to purify uranium oxide in a laboratory was to take advantage of the fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process. Uranium oxide was reacted with potassium fluoride in large vats on the roof of Westinghouse's plant in Bloomfield, New Jersey. This produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. But Edward Creutz, the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce. The hydride or \\"hydramet\\" process, developed by Alexander used calcium hydride as the reducing agent for the conversion of uranium ore to metal. By this means the Metal Hydrides plant in Beverly, Massachusetts, managed to produce a few pounds of uranium metal. Unfortunately, the calcium hydride contained unacceptable amounts of boron, a neutron poison, making the metal unsuitable for use in a reactor. Some months would pass before Clement J. Rodden from the National Bureau of Standards and Union Carbide figured out a means to produce sufficiently pure calcium hydride. Spedding and Wilhelm began looking for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was produced in the form of a powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched. Around this time, someone from the Manhattan Project's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory brought a cube of uranium tetrafluoride‚Äîthe uranium compound being used in the calutrons‚Äîto the Metallurgical Laboratory to discuss the possibility of using it rather than uranium oxide in the reactor. Spedding began wondering whether it would be possible to produce uranium metal from this salt, bypassing the problems with oxygen. He took the cube back to Ames, and asked Wilhelm to investigate. The task was assigned to an associate, Wayne H. Keller. He investigated a process (now known as the Ames process) originally developed by J. C. Goggins and others at the University of New Hampshire in 1926. This involved mixing uranium tetrachloride and calcium metal in a calcium oxide-lined steel pressure vessel (known as a \\"bomb\\") and heating it. Keller was able to reproduce Goggin's results on 3 August 1942, creating a button of very pure uranium metal. The process was then scaled up. By September, bombs were being prepared in steel pipes long, lined with lime to prevent corrosion, and containing up to of uranium tetrafluoride. C. F. Gray took these ingots and cast them into a billet of pure uranium. =Production= On 24 September 1942, Wilhelm took the ingot to Spedding at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and presented it to Compton, whose first reaction was of disbelief. He thought it must be hollow. Spedding had the ingot cut open. It was not hollow. A few days later, the Metallurgical Laboratory's director, Richard L. Doan, went to Ames, where he drew up an Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) contract for the Ames Project to produce of pure uranium metal a day. This would be a pilot plant, with the process eventually being transferred to industry. The OSRD contract was superseded by a Manhattan Project contract in November 1942. The initial contract was for $50,000. By 31 December 1945, the face value of contracts let to the Ames Project totaled $6.907 million; but the work was carried out for $4 million. Wilhelm found an old wooden building on the southeastern edge of the campus. It had been a home economics building until 1926, and then had served as a women's gymnasium until a new one was built in 1941; by 1942 it was mainly used for storage. The building was handed over to the Ames Project, and the wooden floor replaced with a concrete one, much to the disappointment of the university architect, who had been trying for some years to get the place torn down. The building officially became known as the Physical Chemistry Annex; local people called it \\"Little Ankeny\\", after the nearby town of Ankeny, Iowa, where there was an ordnance plant. Looking for machine tools, Wilhelm found a machine shop for sale in Ames. The owner, Bill Maitland, had once made gardening tools, but could no longer obtain the metal he needed due to wartime rationing. Wilhelm bought it for $8,000. The Metallurgical Laboratory supplied two large 40-kilowatt reduction furnaces. The Ames Project supplied two tons of uranium metal to the Metallurgical Laboratory for the construction of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor, which achieved criticality on 2 December 1942. The Ames Project would later supply over 90 percent of the uranium for the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Production rose from of uranium metal per day in December 1942 to per day by the middle of January 1943. For production, the process was changed to use magnesium instead of calcium; magnesium was cheaper, more readily available, and purer. But it was also harder to start the reaction with magnesium than calcium, requiring more heating. The uranium tetrafluoride, known as green salt because of its characteristic color, was supplied by Mallinckrodt, DuPont and Harshaw Chemical, and was ground up on arrival, as was the magnesium. Bombs were normally pipes, long, although pipes, long, could be used to produce ingots. They were heated to for 40 to 60 minutes, after which the mixture spontaneously reacted, reaching temperatures of . A microphone was used to detect the ignition, and the bomb would be moved to a spray chamber to cool. If everything worked, uranium metal biscuit and magnesium fluoride slag would be produced. After the bomb cooled, it would be opened and hammered until the two separated. The resulting biscuit would be stamped, and sent off to be cast. Casting re-shaped the uranium into ingots and removed impurities. The metal biscuits were melted in a graphite crucible and poured into a mold. This produced rods between in diameter and long. The rods were stamped with a number and placed in wooden boxes for shipping to the Metallurgical Laboratory. From there they were sent to the Oak Ridge or the Hanford Site. By July 1943, the Ames Project was producing of uranium metal per month. The cost of a pound of uranium metal fell from $1,000 to around one dollar. Starting in July 1943, Mallinckrodt, Electromet, and DuPont began producing uranium by the Ames process, and Ames phased out its own production by early 1945. The Ames Project began a program of recovering uranium metal from scrap. A new building, known as Physical Chemistry Annex 2, was constructed for the purpose in 1944. Uranium turnings were washed, dried, passed through a magnet to remove iron impurities, and pressed into briquettes. They were then sent to be remelted. The job was handed over to Metal Hydrides and a recovery plant at the Hanford Site in December 1945, by which time the Ames Project had recovered of scrap metal. In all, the Ames Project produced over of uranium metal. All production ceased on 5 August 1945, as did that at Metal Hydrides and DuPont, leaving Mallinckrodt as the only producer of uranium metal in the early post-war period. Other metals Beginning in 1942, along with uranium production operations, the Ames Project conducted a variety of metallurgical research related to the separation and purification of thorium, beryllium and rare-earth metals, such as cerium. =Thorium= In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg established that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, it could be transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if it turned out that uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This was very interesting, because at the time it was thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful. In July and August 1943, the Ames Project attempted to create thorium metal using something similar to the Ames Process. This was unsuccessful, because thorium has a much higher melting point than uranium. Efforts continued into 1944, and it was found that with a zinc chloride booster they could produce a zinc-thorium alloy. Heating to in a graphite crucible could then melt the zinc, which could be drawn off. This left the thorium, which was cast into ingots in beryllia crucibles. Some was produced by 31 December 1945. Thorium sold for $3 a gram before the war; by its end, the Ames Project was producing it for less than 5¬¢ a gram. =Beryllium= Beryllium was used by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a component of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast in a vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended. =Cerium= In mid-1944, the Ames Project was asked to produce cerium. This was being used by the laboratories at Berkeley and Los Alamos for cerium sulphide, which was used in crucibles to cast plutonium. Again, the bomb method was used, this time to reduce anhydrous cerium chloride with calcium using an iodine booster. A special \\"dry room\\" was constructed for drying out the cerium chloride using hydrogen chloride gas. The resulting metal contained calcium and magnesium impurity, so it had to be recast to remove them. The opportunity was taken to make it into diameter rods long, the desired shape. Because cerium is so reactive, the remelting was done in a vacuum, using a calcium oxide or magnesium oxide crucible. The first shipment of cerium metal was made in August 1944. The Ames Laboratory produced of extremely (more than 99%) pure cerium by August 1945, when production ended. Alloys Since uranium metal had been so scarce before the war, little was known about its metallurgy, but with uranium being used in the reactors, the Manhattan Project became keenly interested in its properties. In particular, with water being used for cooling, there was speculation about alloys with high thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion. The Ames Project produced and tested uranium carbide, which had a potential to be used as a fuel in reactors instead of metallic uranium. So too was bismuth, because of its low neutron capture cross section, so the Ames Project produced and tested uranium-bismuth alloys. At one point a proposal was on the table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead. The Ames Project also studied thorium, alloying it with bismuth, carbon, chromium, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, oxygen, tin, tungsten and uranium, and alloyed beryllium with bismuth, lead, thorium, uranium and zinc. Chemistry The chemistry of uranium was the focus of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge. If the chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was poorly understood, that of plutonium was practically unknown, as it had only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products. Post-war Major General Leslie R. Groves Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, visited Iowa State College on 12 October 1945, and presented the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for Excellence in Production for its part in producing uranium for the Manhattan Project. It was unprecedented for a college or university to receive this award, which was usually given to industrial organizations. The award came in the form of a banner sporting four white stars, representing two and a half years of service to the war effort. , the award was on display at Iowa State University in Spedding Hall. The Iowa State Board of Education created the Institute of Atomic Research (IAR) as a coordinating body for research throughout the Midwestern United States on 1 November 1945, with Spedding as its director. The Manhattan Project continued to fund the activities of the Ames Project, but with the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, responsibility passed to the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. On 17 May 1947, the AEC awarded the contract to run the Ames Laboratory, which now had the status of a national laboratory, to Iowa State College. The laboratory remained on the Iowa State College campus, and its faculty and graduate students made up most the staff. Spedding remained its director until he retired in 1968. Administration was delegated to the IAR. Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950, and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall. The Ames Laboratory retained a focus on chemistry and metallurgy, particularly of the rare-earth metals.

It is called as Nayappalli in old records . As per tradition, the Christian settlement of Muttuchira was built up in the 6th century. Antonio Gouvea, the Portuguese voyager who went with Alexis De Menezes, the Archbishop of Goa, recorded the Menezes' visit of Muttuchira in AD 1599. Gouvea used the term Nayapili to mean Muttuchira. The church was previously called as 'Spiritu Sancto' (Latin word for Holy Spirit). Johannes Facundus Raulin in the 1740s in his book 'Historia Ecclesia Malabaricae' uses the term Muttieri. Anquetil Du Perron, a French Scholar and Orientalist in January 1758, mentions about the Catholic church of Holy Ghost at Muttiera and mentions of Saint Sebastian . The Muttuchira church is one of the most ancient churches in India. It is believed to be built up in the sixth century AD. The Christians to this territory were brought by the dependants of the then land lord Myal Pazhur Naboothiripadu and Mamalassery Kaimal. These local rulers helped the Christian congregation to built a new church in that area. Kallarveli family was a prominent one who helped to built the church. Later many others came and settled here from other places . This was an agricultural area mainly of ginger and paddy. The Muttuchira market also came into existence gradually. It is said that Muttuchira had commodity transactions with Kochi back then. The consecration day of Muttuchira church was on the arrival of Pentecost on 25 May 550 AD. The old main church was at a site called Kurisummoodu near Muttuchira market. The ancient cross with a granite base standing in Kurisummoodu is adorned with beautiful carvings. The main church was with traditional arch shaped madbaha with a cross and a sacrificial table . As the church members increased in number, the church space became inadequate and another congregation was established in the seventh century. This new church was built in the site of the present kochupally (little church) inside the compound. The church was harmed during the assault of the Mukalan rulers in ninth century AD. The church bells were taken away by them. That church was later remodelled and used till the 12th century. It was remodeled again in the 13th century. This church was named after the Holy Ghost. This church had the sanctity behind, verandas on both sides and the spaces for the ministers to keep afloat. Denha thirunal was important in this church. It is said that 'the principal ecclesiastical Holy Mass of Bishop Mar Parambil Chandy after his ecclesiastical appointment was offered at Muttuchira church'. An ancient St Thomas cross was discovered inside the madbaha wall, when the old church at Muttuchira was demolished. This cross is believed to be of the fifth century. The paleontology chief of Travancore Govt. examined this cross. His assessment is that the cross must be over 1500 years of age. The houses of worship at Maylappur, Kadamattam, Angamali and Kottayam Valiyapally also have such Persian crosses. This St Thomas cross is set near the entryway inside the new Valiyapally (enormous church) now. However the verifiable records specify that the stone cross in front of the church was made and presented to the church by Kallarveli Kurisingal Mathai Chacko in the thirteenth century. Muttuchira church was known as 'Njayapally'in olden days.. There was no place called Muttuchira back then. The paddy fields that we seen today close to the church could have been lakes before in olden days. The name Muttuchira more likely came into existence when these sites were raised with bunds. The present Valiyapally (huge church) and the presbytery were built amid the reign of Rev. Fr. Kuriakose Parambil, who was the ward minister here since 1859. This is elevated to a Forane church since 1890. The development of the five storied chime tower was begun amid the reign of Rev. Fr. Ouseph Chakkalackal, who was the ward cleric in 1901. There are three major bells on the fifth floor. The chime tower has a cross on top of it. The height of the chime tower is 150 feet. Ancient Mural collections Ancient Painting at Muttuchira Church Muttuchira Church has a good collection of ancient paintings. Muttuchira stone inscriptions Ancient Rock Inscription from Muttuchira Syro Malabar Catholic Church Ancient Rock Inscription from Muttuchira Syro Malabar Catholic Church Muttuchira stone engravings are old Malayalam engravings called Vattezhuthu-Nanam Monum.

The engravings are on a rectangular stone piece in two areas partitioned by a vertical line in the middle. As indicated by Mr T K Joseph, this engravings must be of AD1581 or later. This tablet has been the subject of broad examination by numerous researchers. This rock chunk was found on the western mass of the ground floor room of the two story building joined toward the northern side of the old Church of the Holy Ghost.

The work was jointly commissioned for the percussionist Evelyn Glennie by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Nashville Symphony, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the Music Department (Lisbon), and the National Arts Centre Orchestra. It was given its world premiere by Glennie and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Marin Alsop in Pittsburgh on February 21, 2008. Composition =Structure= Conjurer has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in three movements: #Wood #Metal #Skin The title of each movement corresponds to the type of percussion instruments used in it. Corigliano thus employed such instruments as the marimba and wood block for the first movement, the vibraphone and chimes for the second, and timpani and bass drum for the third. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a solo percussionist and strings with an optional complement of brass, consisting of four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, and a tuba. Reception Conjurer has been praised by music critics. Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News said it \\"seems so lacking in discomfort that it might have been something that came from a former fellow traveler of West Coast percussion experimentalists Lou Harrison, John Cage and Henry Cowell.\\" David Bratman of the San Francisco Classical Voice wrote, \\"Percussion is so frequently used to punctuate loud passages in music that listeners may forget it can be used differently. Much of this concerto is actually fairly quiet, though the second movement rises to an agitated middle section. The finale, which is very loud indeed, nevertheless has a subdued section with a distant violin solo (the only such passage in the work) over quiet bass drum.\\" Despite this, he also noted, \\"At 40 minutes, the work outstayed its welcome.\\" Recording A recording of Conjurer featuring Evelyn Glennie and the Albany Symphony Orchestra under David Alan Miller was released through Naxos Records on September 3, 2013. Glennie's performance on the album later won the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo.

He was the Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1932 until 1939 and died by a self-administered gunshot wound in Parliament House in 1939. Biography Pollock was born at Charters Towers, Queensland, the son of Matthew Pollock and his wife Naomi (n√©e Gauvin). He was educated at Richmond Hill State School in Charters Towers and for most of his working life he engaged in bush work in Western and Northern Queensland. On 27 December 1909 he married Margaret Adeline Shepherd and together had two sons and a daughter. Pollock died at Parliament House, Brisbane in March 1939. Public career Pollock, a member of the Labor, was unopposed for the seat of Gregory at the 1915 by-election caused by the resignation of the sitting member, William Hamilton. He had a long career representing the electorate and it ended with his death in 1939. He was the Chairman of Committees from 1924-1929 and Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1932 until 1939. During his time in parliament he built up an extensive knowledge of standing orders which he used to great advantage against the Moore Government between 1929‚Äì1932. On becoming Speaker he served the position with dignity and distinctionMotion of Condolence -- Hansard. Retrieved 15 May 2016. and he strictly interpreted the standing orders and kept close control over the House. He even once rebuked his leader, Premier Forgan Smith, for reading his speech on a bill, something that is not permitted in parliament. Death For the last several years of his life Pollock was in poor health and for his last two years he was in need of a walking stick. On 24 March 1939, he could take no more and shot himself with a shotgun he used for pigeon shooting. A note was found and it read: A complete nervous and mental breakdown. Cannot carry on. Too much pain. He signed his name to it and underneath was a postscript which read: My poor, tortured brain. Goodbye to my loved ones. His body was found when the manageress of the parliamentary refreshment room, (Miss Curnow) went to inquire what Pollock would like for lunch. She went back to the refreshment rooms and told the Premier what had happened. He went to Pollock's room and found him, apparently dead, and ordered that the doctor and police be immediately summoned. Upon leaving the room, Forgan Smith forgot to leave it unlocked and the police had to gain entrance by walking along a narrow parapet on the first floor and climbing through the window. Besides some of his parliamentary colleagues, his funeral, which was held the next day, was a private affair. It proceeded from the funeral parlour of K.M. Smith in South Brisbane to the Mt Thompson Crematorium.

Its mechanism is to activate the society and interact with it to grow and expand to the point of becoming as large as the society itself, then blend and dissolve completely resulting in a society that is concerned with education as an ongoing imperative issue. The group started with a number of university students and graduates. Its first activity was a campaign to collect used school books from families and private schools and redistribute them to the poorer students and schools. The campaign successfully distributed more than 5,000 books across Sudan. As of September 20, 2012, the Facebook group had 18,197 members. The group was originally called Teachers Without Borders (Arabic: ŸÖÿπŸÑŸÖŸàŸÜ ÿ®ŸÑÿß ÿ≠ÿØŸàÿØ). The name later changed to Education Without Borders after the authorities in Sudan refused to register it as an NGO, claiming the proposed name requires members of the organization to be registered teachers. Despite the name change, the group remains unregistered with the Humanitarian Aid Commission of Sudan. Education Without Borders has carried out several projects since its inauguration in 2011 including the My painting, My smile art exhibition (Arabic: Basmati fi Rasmati), which featured paintings by poorer school students from across the country depicting their ambitions, dreams, and hopes for the future. The exhibition also features professional photography by group members depicting the schools of the participating students. This creates an image of both the present situation and the future the organization hopes to create. One of the current projects the group is undertaking is the Translation project - where it hopes to translate various wikipedia articles from English to Arabic in various topics (Medical Sciences, Engineering, Science, Economics and History). The end goal of the project is to increase the Arabic content on wikipedia. Projects * Academic adoption project. * School rehabilitation project \\"hit & run\\". * Textbook collection campaigns. * Translation project. * School library project. * Reformatory project. * Concepts project. * \\"How to choose your academic specialty field\\" project. * Education Without Borders magazine. * Education Without Borders exhibitions (my painting is my smile for example) Academic adoption projects Education Without Borders academic adoption vision is to provide a collection of academic programs for schools that has a shortage of teachers or a lack of cultural and/or health programs. EWB interacts with such schools and assigns a group of its volunteers as teachers to fill the gap, and another group to execute the programs associated with the academic support provided for the chosen school. During the last year, EWB has adopted Al Inkaz elementary school, which is located in Bahry, as well as Al Jeref reformatory in Khartoum. Textbooks collection campaign \\"your old book is my new book\\" \\"Your old book is my new book\\" is an ongoing campaign which aims to collect, repair and redistribute the used school textbooks amongst the schools in villages and areas in need. This project was the kickoff for EWB. It started in 2011 with collecting 5,000 textbooks and reached more than 8,000 textbooks this year. EWB Schools Rehabilitation Project \\"Hit & Run\\" \\"Hit & run\\" has an objective to restore and rehabilitate old school buildings in coordination with the residents to create a more fitting environment for students. The project started mid-year last year (2011) in two schools: one in Al Kamlen and the other in Soba. Since then, almost 10 schools were rehabilitated. =Concepts project= Social concepts are a core part of EWB, since EWB's objectives exceed mere educational aspects. The project is a sub-group that is concerned with the main concepts in the society that need correction or changing. EWB tries using positive and acceptable methods to change and adjust wrong or improper concepts and beliefs that have spread amongst the society. Concept project follows the same vision of EWB ‚Äî to dissolve in the society, resulting in a moderate modern society that follows a mature reasonable social demeanour. =Translation project= The translation project aims to boost the usage of the Arabic language on the Internet and to provide students and higher institutes with recent information on the other. It also aims to encourage scientific research as a parallel objective goes hand in hand with the process of academic education. The project plan is to: * Translate 100 recent studies as a first stage. The studies will be related to medicine, engineering, and the economy. * Choose the studies carefully to make sure they are recent‚Äînot more than two years old‚Äîand issued from a high-class institute of the university. * Distribute the studies amongst a group of specialized doctors or professors to edit them. * Provide the college libraries with copies of those studies (both Arabic and English) as well as republish them online for free. Currently, various studies are being translated by a group of volunteers who are working on this project at the moment. EWB is now only translating from English to Arabic but the future plans include other languages as well. =Al Jeref Reformatory= EWB has fully adopted Al Jeref Reformatory. Academically, it provided teachers for the reformatory school. Socially, a rehabilitation program was started which aims to make the children get involved in various activities including painting, embroidery, theater, music, and singing. EWB has also arranged for many cultural lectures in various topics in coordination with several institutes. Also, a program for teaching children ‚Äúteach five‚Äù has been initiated, where each volunteer adopt five children and commit to teaching them reading and writing. A library was provided to help in this project. =Reading Day= An annual event organized by EWB for the first time at 2013 on international author day, more than 5000 readers from Khartoum gathered at the green yard and start the biggest reading group in the history of Sudan. =Library= EWB has also founded a library, where the books come from individuals as subscription fees. Every member has to pay three books and are allowed to borrow one book for one week. The goal of the project is to provide reading space at a low cost and with the contribution of society. There are two libraries one is hosted by Zol & Zola club and the other one is hosted by the University of Khartoum college of engineering. The library organizes cultural event monthly, and usually, it's discussion session in percent of some Sudanese writer like Stila Galiano and Mujahid Khalf Allah =Reading Club= This project has reached the 40th book in 2016. Since starting in 2014, the club members have actively discussed and reviewed one book every three weeks. First, a copy of the book uploaded on the project page. Anyone interested can then read it and prepare their review to present it at the club event.

History The Governor General of the Belgian Congo appealed to the Jesuits to instruct and educate the increasing number of young Europeans in L√©opoldville. On 4 October 1937 the college opened its doors under the name St. Albert College, to honor St. Albert of Louvain, patron saint of the current Belgian monarch Albert I. It was located on premises lent by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart. Two Jesuit priests and a scholastic along with a layman handled the first three classes as well as school and extracurricular activities. The school calendar, class schedule, and the number of course hours followed the Belgian directives. The curriculum was deliberately styled after that of the Jesuit St John Berchmans College, Brussels. In 1940, the college had to accommodate all European children without religious distinction, since they had become stranded in Africa by the Second World War. The college modified its name to Albert I College, after the King. The official opening of the college was on 3 October 1940, in the presence of civil and ecclesiastical authorities. In 1941 the Jesuit Curia in Rome authorized and financed the erection of several buildings. In 1945 the Marist Brothers ended their assistance with the primary division of the school. There were then 123 elementary and 93 secondary students. At independence there were 515 elementary students, 227 in Greco-Latin, 151 in Modern Science, 77 in Latin 6th, 49 in Latin 5th, and 20 in Rhetoric. These statistics would increase year by year to an average of 2,400 students ‚Äì 1,750 primary and 650 secondary ‚Äì by 1975. At the introduction of the ideology of African authenticity in the country, Albert I College became Boboto College.

Chemical Engineering journal of McGraw Hill listed him among the 10 most distinguished chemical engineers in the world in 1988. He was the author of nine texts in chemical engineering, including Organic Synthesis Engineering, a 2001 publication which is known to have introduced the topic as a definitive scientific stream and Heterogeneous reactions: Analysis, Examples, and Reactor Design, reportedly the first comprehensive text in chemical engineering. He was a recipient of honorary doctorate degrees from University of Salford, and University of Wisconsin, besides several other awards and honors which included Om Prakash Bhasin Award, Richard H. Wilhelm Award, William H. Walker Award and Homi Bhabha Medal. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1990, for his contributions to science. Early life Laxmangudi Doraiswamy, born in Karnataka, did his schooling at Methodist Boys High School, Hyderabad before graduating in chemistry (BSc) from Nizam College, then under the University of Madras. Doraiswamy's English skills had prompted his school principal to advise him to take up literature as a career. He also wrote poetry but none of his poems were published. Choosing chemical engineering for his further education, he secured the degree of BS, in 1946, from Alagappa Chettiar College of Engineering and Technology (Accet), one of the only two Indian institutions offering chemical engineering for advanced studies at that time. His performance in the engineering examinations earned him a scholarship from the Government of Andhra Pradesh which helped him to pursue further studies at the University of Wisconsin and the twenty one-year old reached Wisconsin when the winter of 1948 was its peak in December. It was during his stay at the University of Wisconsin, he had the opportunity to meet Olaf Andreas Hougen, a known academic in chemistry and a later-day Professor Emeritus of Wisconsin University, After completing his master's degree in 1950, he continued at the university to secure his doctoral degree in chemical engineering in 1952 for which Hougen reportedly assisted him in getting permission from the Nizam government of Hyderabad, who wanted Doraiswamy to return to India to start serving the government. His doctoral thesis was on semichemical pulping, prepared under the supervision of Hougen and John McGovern of the Forest Products Laboratory, US Department of Agriculture.  Academic and professional career  Alagappa Chettiar College of Engineering and Technology. National Chemical Laboratory, Pune Doraiswamy's career started at R. L. Carlisle Chemical and Manufacturing Company of Brooklyn for a short stint of two years and he left US for India in 1954 to take up the position of a scientist at the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune where he continued his researches in chemical engineering. His tenure at NCL lasted a quarter of a century, rising in ranks as a senior scientist, assistant director (1961), deputy director (1966) and superannuating in 1989, as the first non-chemist to head the organization, after holding the post of the director since 1978. In between, he was reportedly offered the post of the director general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the largest research and development (R&D;) organisation in India, controlling 38 national laboratories, 39 outreach centres, 3 Innovation Complexes and 5 units, but he declined the offer to stay with NCL. It was at this time, NCL entered into a bilateral co-operation agreement with the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering of the Iowa State University and this led to his visit to Iowa where he met Peter Reilly, the then Anson Marston Distinguished Professor of the university. It is reported that Reilly persuaded Doraiswamy to join the university as the Glenn Murphy Visiting Professor of Engineering which he agreed to and, later, joined the institution as a permanent faculty in 1992 as the Herbert Stiles Professor. During his stay in Iowa, he was involved in various visiting lectures and symposia and became the Anson Marston Distinguished Professor, the highest academic honour for engineering academics at the university. He continued his association with the university even after his retirement in 2001 till his death 2012.  Legacy  = Academic contributions = In 2001, Doraiswamy published a seminal work, Organic Synthesis Engineering, which defined the subject and introduced it as an independent science discipline. The book emphasized on catalysis and the role of process intensification in enhancing overall productivity and explained the applications of catalysis in organic synthesis. This is reported to be a pioneering attempt in chemical reactions engineering and assisted in conjoining the disciplines of chemical and chemical engineering processes. Another of his work, Heterogeneous Reactions: Analysis, Examples, and Reactor Design, co-authored by M. M. Sharma, is considered as the first comprehensive text on chemical engineering. At NCL as well as at Iowa State University, he mentored 45 research scholars in their post graduate and doctoral studies. He was a visiting professor at six universities and sat at the editorial boards of many refereed journals like Indian Chemical Engineer, the official journal of the Journal of the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE). It was during his tenure as the head of NCL, a Centre of Excellence in Catalysis was established which eventually returned several scientific contributions. He headed the working group on Catalysis of the Indo-Russian Science and Technology Cooperation and was instrumental in NCL starting collaborative ventures with Salford University, UK and with the University of Erlangen, Germany. = Scientific contributions = Doraiswamy was known to have introduced several innovations in chemical reaction engineering. Gas-solid catalytic and non-catalytic reactions, solid-solid reactions, phase-transfer catalysis mediated reactions, stochastic modelling, fluidization, adsorption and catalysis and catalytic reactor analysis are some of the areas where his researches reportedly made improvements. He launched radical changes in the processing of dimethylaniline, chloromethanes, methylchlorosilanes, ethylenediamine and vitamin B6. He introduced a complete process for methyl, ethyl, butyl and 2-ethylhexylacrylates while the process initiated by him, jointly with G. D. Rihani in 1965 for calculating enthalpy, entropy and the Cp for an ideal gas is known as Rihani-Doraiswamy method. Verma-Doraiswamy method for the estimation of Standard enthalpy of formation is another process that bears his name. The invention jointly made with Thomas Wheelock of a calcium based sorbent for coal gas desulphurization, introduction of zeolite catalysts, the development of a xylene isomerization process and a new methodology for the alkylation of benzene with alcohols are some of his other contributions. It was at the tissue culture pilot plant established by him where a method of propagation of bamboo by tissue culture was identified for the first time. = Publications = Doraiswamy, who reportedly had good English language skills, published nine books, five of them original works and four edited books, as well as over 180 scientific papers published in peer- reviewed national and international journals. These writings are known to have assisted in expanding the canvass of chemical engineering beyond its conventional boundaries by introducing themes such as phase transfer catalysis and sonochemical reactions. Apart from Organic Synthesis Engineering and Heterogeneous Reactions: Analysis, Examples, and Reactor Design, the other three books published by him are The Analysis of Chemically Reacting Systems : A Stochastic Approach (1987), Excellence in an Overlapping Culture: The Big History of India‚Äôs National Chemical Laboratory (2011) and Chemical Reaction Engineering : Beyond the Fundamentals (2014). The lectures delivered by Doraiswamy in the Hougen Lecture Series were compiled by the University of Wisconsin and published in 1988 under the title, Across Millennia : Some Thoughts on Ancient and Contemporary Science and Engineering. Frontiers in Chemical Reaction Engineering (1984), Transport processes in Fluidized Bed Reactors (1987), Recent Advances in the Engineering Analysis of Chemically Reacting Systems (1987), and Transport in Fluidized Particle Systems (1989) are the four books edited by him. = Social contributions = Doraiswamy was reported to have contributed in bringing order to various departments at NCL and in recruiting talents. As the head of the organization, he introduced the scheme of preferential recruitment of widows of the former NCL employees and established a local school and shopping centre in NCL campus.  Awards and honors  Doraiswamy, an Anson Marston Distinguished Professor of the Iowa State University, was elected as the fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1974, and the Indian National Science Academy followed suit in 1977. He was also a fellow of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) (1997) and the National Academy of Sciences, India. The Chemical Engineering magazine of McGraw-Hill listed him among the 10 most distinguished chemical engineers in the world in 1988. He received the degree of Doctor of Science (honoris causa) from the University of Salford in 1982 and the University of Wisconsin Madison in 1991. In 2010, the National Academy of Engineering inducted him as a member. The Indian National Science Academy awarded him the Syed Hussain Zaheer Medal in 1983 and he was awarded the Om Prakash Bhasin Award for Science and Technology of the Om Prakash Bhasin Foundation in 1986. He received the Jawaharlal Nehru Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987, followed by the Personal Achievement Award of Chemical Engineering magazine in 1988. The Government of India included him in the Republic Day Honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Bhushan in 1990, the same year as he received the Richard H. Wilhelm Award of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. In 2001, he received the Padma Vibhushan Prof. M. M. Sharma Medal of the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE) and IIChE repeated the honor with Dr. B. P. Godrej Life Time Achievement Award in 2003. He received another award, the William H. Walker Award, for Excellence in Contributions to Chemical Engineering Literature from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 2004. He was also a recipient of the Homi Bhabha Medal. On his 60th birthday, the Indian Academy of Sciences published one of their books, re-titled as Reactions and Reaction Engineering in Doraiswamy's honor. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers honored him on his 70th birthday by bringing out a collection of research papers under the nameL.K. Doraiswamy Festschrift. The Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers have instituted an annual oration, Padma Bhushan Prof. L. K. Doraiswamy Chemcon Distinguished Speaker Award, in his honor, running since 2001. Two of the institutions he was closely associated with, viz. Iowa State University and the National Chemical Laboratory, honor Doraiswamy by jointly organizing a US-India lectureship every year.  Personal life  Doraiswamy was born in a Brahmin family as the only brother of three sisters born to Laxmangudi Krishnamurthy and Kamala in Bengaluru on 13 May 1927. Krishnamurthy was the head of Geological Survey of India at their Hyderabad branch and the young Doraiswamy was brought up in Lingasugur, a small hamlet near Hatti Gold Mines and home to many archaeological sites, in the south Indian state of Karnataka. He was married to Rajalakshmi, the marriage taking up place in 1952 after his return to India from Wisconsin, and the couple had a son, Deepak, a doctor in chemical engineering and a daughter, Sandhya, an MPhil and CPA holder. Both continue to live in Pennsylvania, Deepak at Landenberg and Sandhya at Danville. Doraiswamy, towards the later days of his life, suffered from heart ailments and underwent a bypass surgery. However, he could not survive for long and died on 2 June 2012, while recuperating from the surgical trauma, survived by his children; his wife had preceded him in death. Though the latter part of his life was spent mostly in US, he retained his Indian citizenship till the end.

The National Map , accessed March 15, 2011 stream which drains the Great Marsh of Indiana Dunes State Park and Indiana Dunes National Park in Porter County, Indiana, United States. Dunes Creek passes through the coastal sand dunes to empty into Lake Michigan. History Petit Fort was established at the mouth of Dunes Creek, then known as Fort Creek, from 1750 to 1790. In 1837 the town of City West, Indiana, was established at the mouth of Fort Creek, ten miles west of Michigan City. The creek was dammed and a sawmill operated there making lumber from the plentiful \\"large pine trees which grew upon the bluffs\\". The town was abandoned shortly thereafter due to the financial panic of 1837. Watershed and course Dunes Creek sources west of Interstate 49 and south of U.S. Highway 20 and flows northward receiving first the Great Marsh tributary from the east then the West Branch tributary which drains Cowles Bog. The (2997-hectare) Dunes Creek watershed extends from the Mittal Steel (formerly Bethlehem and ISG Steel) plant in Portage in the west to Beverly Shores in the east. Originally, Dunes Creek included much of Michigan City. Dunes Creek is one of three perennial streams which flow from the Great Marsh system into Lake Michigan. The other two streams are man-made ditches to the east of the Dunes Creek watershed which were cut through the dunes to provide for farming, industrial use, and housing. These ditches divided the eastern Dunes Creek watershed and created the new subwatersheds of Kintzele Ditch and Derby Creek. Beginning in 1998, the national lakeshore began restoration of the Great Marsh by closing Derby Ditch and restoring .Great Marsh Restoration, At Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Pamphlet, Porter, Indiana, obtained 2017, https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/upload/great_marsh_restoration_pdf.pdf In 2012, the terminus of Dunes Creek was daylighted and restored after being buried under a parking lot for 80 years. Dunes Creek's West Branch flows east- northeast from Cowles Bog for to join the Dunes Creek mainstem. Its source used to be even further west but is now diverted to the East Arm Little Calumet River. Habitat and Wildlife Dunes Creek suffers from E. coli contamination likely related to ditching and draining of wetlands rather than anthropogenic point sources. Discharge from Dunes Creek into Lake Michigan causes chronic beach closures. Sampling of its sister creek, Derby Ditch, which also drains the Great Marsh; and Painterville Creek, in Warren Dunes State Park, Michigan show similar broad distributions of E. coli.

Reception  Chris Mautner of The Comics Journal observed that the manga is \\"enigmatic and elliptical enough to frustrate and confound even an attentive reader\\", noting its blurring of perception, fragmented narratives, and its poetic ambitions. Mautner lamented that there wasn't more background material and concluded that the manga will likely require multiple readings, although the award for doing so might not be obvious. Noel Murray of The A.V.

Anestis Delias ( 1912 ‚Äì 31 July 1944) was a Greek bouzouki player, composer and singer of rebetiko, also known with the nicknames Anestaki (ŒëŒΩŒµœÉœÑŒ¨Œ∫Œπ) or Artemis (ŒëœÅœÑŒ≠ŒºŒ∑œÇ). Biography Delias real surname was Delios (ŒîŒ≠ŒªŒπoœÇ). He was born in Smyrna and had two younger sisters. His father Panagiotis, who was a shoemaker and a noted santuri player, taught him to play the guitar. After the end of the Greco-Turkish war of 1919‚Äì1922, Delias and his family moved to Greece and settled at Drapetsona. Having lost his father in the destruction of Smyrna, Delias worked in many different jobs to support his family.  Career Info  Delias was a very talented musician who by the early 1930s had moved on to play the bouzouki and baglamas. In 1934, together with Yiorgos Batis, Stratos Pagioumtzis and Markos Vamvakaris, he founded the rebetiko quartet, I Tetras i Xakousti tou Peiraios (, literally Piraeus' famous quartet). This quartet influenced subsequent generations of musicians and composers. Delias did not produce any recordings during the Metaxas dictator regime that had been established in 1936 since, like many artists of the time, he refused to accept any censoring of his songs.  Drug abuse and death  In 1937, he was introduced to heroin by a prostitute and became addicted. He was later convicted of drug use and was expelled to the island of Ios, where in 1938 he met Michalis Genitsaris. When Delias returned to Athens, his friends Pagioumtzis and Bayianteras tried to help him abstain from drugs but without success. Eventually, he increased his daily heroin dose and was unable to perform or work as a result. He was found dead from a heroin overdose on the morning of July 31, 1944. According to other sources, Delias died in 1941. He was the only rebetiko artist to die from drug use. Vamvakaris once said that Delias was \\"an angel thrown in trash\\". Despite his short life, Delias is an important figure in rebetiko. Many believe that if he had lived longer, he would influence rebetiko and La√Øk√≥ genres comparable to that of Tsitsanis.  Discography  Many Delias covers were later recorded and published from various singers. His only personal compilation was published from Lyra Disc Company Notes External links *ŒëŒΩŒ≠œÉœÑŒøœÇ ŒîŒµŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ 1912 ‚Äì 1941 Category:1912 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from ƒ∞zmir Category:Smyrniote Greeks Category:Greeks of the Ottoman Empire Category:Greek male singers Category:Greek singer-songwriters Category:Modern Greek-language singers Category:Greek rebetiko singers Category:Rebetiko musicians Category:Greek bouzouki players Category:20th-century Greek singers Category:Drug culture Category:Drug-related deaths in Greece Category:Deaths by heroin overdose Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Anestis Delias"},{"id":"50545907","text":"Dorcadion shestopalovi is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

He was a Liberal Unionist and later a Conservative Member of Parliament for East Somerset from 1910 to 1918. Business interests Jardine took over father's lace machinery business, John Jardine. He had four factories in Nottingham and others in Draycott and Newark, employing some 2,500-3,000 workers in 1907. \\\\- Another of his factories in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, provides the reason for his adoption as a parliamentary candidate in that county. His company exported lace-making machinery to the United States, France and Germany. In 1924, he became the owner of the Barlock Tyewriter Company, set up in Basford. The company later became the Byron Typewriter Company and was taken over by the British Oliver Typewriter Company, under licence from the US Oliver Typewriter Company, in 1948. He was chairman of the Trent Navigation Company until his death. Glastonbury Abbey In 1907, Jardine was associated with the purchase of Glastonbury Abbey on behalf of the Ecclesiastical authorities. The Abbey was offered for sale by auction amid considerable disquiet that it could be purchased by \\"an American plutocrat\\". Jardine's bid of ¬£30,000 was successful. Jardine announced that he had no intention of living there, but that he would sell the Abbey to the Church of England for what he had paid. Politics In the January 1910 general election, Jardine contested the East Somerset constituency as a Liberal Unionist. He defeated the sitting MP, the Liberal John William Howard Thompson, by 4,997 votes to 3,970. At the following general election, in December 1910, he again defeated Thompson, by 4,748 votes to 3,875. The Liberal Unionist and Conservative parties merged in 1912. The constituency was abolished at the 1918 general election which Jardine did not contest. He was made a baronet in 1919 and was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1928‚Äì9. Personal life Jardine was educated at Tudor House School in Nottingham and at the Lyc√©e Imp√©rial in Saint-Omer, France. He married Ada n√©e Fletcher She died in 1925. They had one son, John, and a daughter, Iris. Jardine died on 26 April 1947, aged 87. His estate was valued at ¬£502,340 gross (¬£480,076 net).

Stratos Pagioumtzis ( 1904 ‚Äì 16 November 1971) was a Greek rebetiko singer, also known with the nickname Stratos the sluggard (Œ£œÑœÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ Œø œÑŒµŒºœÄŒ≠ŒªŒ∑œÇ) or simply Stratos. Biography Pagioumtzis was born in Ayvalƒ±k of Asia Minor at 1904 and migrated to Greece before the Greco-Turkish war of 1919‚Äì1922. He settled in the port city of Piraeus and supported himself by working as a fisherman and later as a supplier of provisions to moored ships, always having in mind to work with his greatest passion, music. He started to sing professionally in the late 1920s and his first recordings appeared in 1933. In 1934, He got together with other Greek rebetiko singers Yiorgos Batis, Anestis Delias and Markos Vamvakaris, and founded the rebetiko quartet, I Tetras i Xakousti tou Peiraios (, literally The famed quarted of Piraeus). In 1937, during the Metaxas dictator regime, he was convicted of drug use and was expelled to the Cycladic island of Sifnos. Pagioumtzis had a beautiful voice which made him widely known. He is considered as one of the greatest singer of the classical rebetiko era. Pagioumtzis recorded over 400 songs with his voice and worked with many well-known composers such as Vassilis Tsitsanis, Giannis Papaioannou, Bayianteras, and Panagiotis Toundas. Vassilis Tsitsanis once said that Pagioumtzis had nightingales in his throat. Pagioumtzis died of a stroke on 16 November 1971 in New York, after completing a concert in a Greek nightclub.

The buildings were built between 1824 and 1828 by Amon Wilds and Charles Busby. History The Arundel Terrace houses were built for Thomas Read Kemp by Amon Wilds and Charles Busby between 1824 and 1828. All were constructed with Doric porches and ironwork balconies, although not all these remain, and the buildings were built facing the sea. They were built as part of a 106 house development plan for the Kemp Town area of Brighton. Number 13 was the first building to be completed, and was used from 1826‚Äì1851 as the Bush Hotel, before being put up for sale by the building's owners, a Mr Creasy and Mr Wilkinson. The building was then converted into a private house, and then a girls' school. In 1910 it became a nursing home, and in the 1950 it was converted into a guest house. Number One was the home of doctor and financier Chevalier Fran√ßois de Rosaz; in his will, de Rosaz asked for the building to be converted into a Catholic asylum. Writer William Harrison Ainsworth lived at number 5 from 1853‚Äì1867; during his time living at 5 Arundel Terrace, he wrote the novels The Star Chamber, The Flitch of Bacon, The Spendthrift, The Life and Adventures of Mervyn Clitheroe, and Ovingdean Grange. 5 Arundel Terrace has a blue plaque outside, in commemoration of Ainsworth.

The castle is located in the municipality of Zwingenberg in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  Location  The spur castle was built on a hill spur in the triangle formed by the confluence of the steep Wolfschlucht gorge with the Neckar valley and lies about 50 metres above the river.  History  The castle was probably built in the 13th century by the Hohenstaufen ministerialis, William of Wimpfen. The first record of it dates to the year 1326. A nephew of William of Wimpfen called himself von Zwingenberg. Because the Zwingenbergs were robber knights, in 1363 they were driven from the castle and it was slighted in the name of the emperor. In 1403, the Lord of Hirschhorn was enfeoffed with the Zwingenberg and had it rebuilt. After his line had died out, ownership switched between the Electorate of Mainz, Electorate of the Palatinate and the Grand Duchy of Baden. The lord of the castle today is Louis (Ludwig), Prince of Baden (born 1937), a descendant of Grand Duke Charles Frederick of Baden. Above Zwingenberg Castle are the remains of F√ºrstenstein Castle.

It supports the underprivileged through sports and encourages attachment to the city of Valencia.  History  Although there is no clear account of when the Foundation was created (possibly between 1992‚Äì1994), it is thought to have been conceived after the conversion of Valencia CF into a \\"Public limited sports company\\" or S.A.D. (Sociedad An√≥nima Deportiva). The Foundation gained notoriety in the summer of 2009 when it received a loan from Bancaja (now known as Bankia) allowing the football club to avoid bankruptcy. The Foundation took 72% of the club's shares, becoming the majority shareholder. This loan was backed by the Valencian Finance Institute (IVF) which belongs to the Valencian government. After years of delaying payments to the government of Valencia (sponsor) and Bankia (main creditor of the club), during the General Meeting of Shareholders on December 10, 2013, the Foundation decided to sell its shares. On February 24, 2014, a Management Committee for sale was created, including a representative from each of the following 4 parties: Valencia CF, the VCF Foundation, Bankia, and the Generalitat Valenciana. Between April and May of that year, seven offers were received and considered for the purchase of the shares. The final vote of the 22 patrons of the VCF Foundation took place on May 17, 2014. After months of tough negotiations, the shares were sold on October 24, 2014 to Peter Lim, through his company, Meriton Holdings, which presently manages and directs Valencia CF.  Objectives  In order to comply with the objectives of the VCF Foundation, three main areas of activity were created: = Culture and roots = This area is related to the historical heritage of the club. The Department of Heritage researches, catalogs, restores, and preserves all kinds of related items such as trophies, historical shirts, and significant documents like the Constitution Act which governs the Mestalla's boardroom. All of these objects are in the Museum of Valencia CF at the Mestalla and can be visited on a tour of its most significant spaces such as the VIP box, the exhibition title, the mixed zone, and the press room, among other places. On May 8, 2015, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports officially recognized the Valencia CF Museum as a museum of Valencia. Next to the museum there is a plan to build a Center for Documentation and Research that will preserve and disseminate the documented heritage of Valencia CF. = Social and charitable responsibility = This area is responsible for the solidarity initiatives. These initiatives are aimed at reaching the maximum number of people and giving priority to the most deprived. Collaboration with other entities that share objectives and interests in solidarity with the Foundation is also taken into account. = Education and health = This area will focus on encouraging innovation in sport from various disciplines such as medicine, physical education, sports law and technology, and enhancing different Masters, seminars, conferences and specialized courses taught by the Training Center. Collaboration with universities and institutions linked to education and healthy habits among the club's supporters and society in general, are promoted.

Minister of Interior between December 9, 1919, and June 18, 1921, in the Latvian Provisional Government. After the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, Bergs was arrested and deported to a prison camp where he died.Arveds Bergs His father, Kristaps Bergs, was a self-made businessman and property developer in Riga. Arveds attended Riga City Gymnasium (1888-1892) and went to study law at Dorpat University (1892-1896) where he joined Lettonia fraternity. After graduation, he went on to work in St. Petersburg. In 1900 returned to Riga, where parallel to his work as a lawyer, Bergs soon began publishing editorials in his father's newspaper Baltijas Vƒìstnesis (The Baltic Messenger) and became active in Riga Latvian Society and its Latvian Encyclopedia for which he wrote some articles. In 1904 Bergs purchased a printing house. During the 1905 Russian Revolution Bergs used the short period of liberalization to establish the Latvian Democratic Party together with Augusts Deglavs and Gustavs Zemgals. On July 25, 1907, he was exiled from the Russian Empire proper to the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland for his political activities. Bergs used this time to absorb nationalist and independence ideas from more advanced Finns and to travel to Germany and Switzerland, where he saw different models of democracy. In Switzerland, he befriended Latvian poet and politician Rainis. In autumn of 1908 Bergs was allowed to return to Riga, where he concentrated on his work as an editor and undertook more travelling to the Middle East and Egypt. In early summer of 1915 German Imperial Army invaded and quickly occupied Kurzeme and Zemgale. A large part of the inhabitants were ordered by the retreating Russian Imperial Army to leave their homes. Latvian society soon organized Latvian refugee support central committee. After the death of Vilis Olavs in 1917 it was headed by Arveds Bergs. After the February Revolution in Russia this post became increasingly political and Bergs was involved in the establishment of the Provisional Latvian National Council, which strongly advocated political unification of Latvian inhabited lands and proclamation of an independent state. In 1917 Bergs re-established his Democratic Party and in August 1918 returned from Petrograd to Riga which was soon occupied by Germans. After the proclamation of Latvian independence on November 18, 1918 by Tautas Padome, in December Bergs, as a lawyer, was appointed to head the Chamber of Courts. In early 1919 went to the Paris Peace Conference as a member of Latvian delegation. He was the Minister of Interior between 1919-1921 in the early governments headed by KƒÅrlis Ulmanis during the Latvian War of Independence. As the leader of his party, Bergs was elected to the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, 1st Saeima, 2nd Saeima and 3rd Saeima, but no longer took part in governments. During 1921-1934 he published and edited newspaper Latvis (Latvian) which represented center-right, Latvian nationalist opinions of well-off city dwellers. According to the Jewish Daily Bulletin, he was already known as an anti-semite in the 1920s. After the May 15, 1934 Latvian coup d'√©tat, Bergs supported the new regime in his newspaper. During this time, his newspaper pleaded for stronger discrimination of Jewish population than of other minorities.

Common names for this species include; shrubby wattle, shrubby mulga, myall-gidgee, northern myall and grey myall. Indigenous Australians the Pitjantjatjara peoples know the tree as ikatuka, the Warlpiri know it as jirlarti and the Arrernte know it as irrakwetye. Description The rounded or straggly shrub or tree typically grows to a height of . The species can have multiple stems at the base with a spreading and bushy canopy above. The phyllodes are variable with a narrowly linear to linear-oblanceolate shape that can sometimes be narrowly elliptic and straight to shallowly curved. Each phyllode is in length and wide. It blooms in the Spring from September to November and produces yellow flowers. Each inflorescence has globular heads that are in diameter and composed of 30 to 60 golden flowers. Seed pods form later that are approximately in length and wide. The pods are woody and wrinkled over the seeds. The seeds are dull brown in colour, longitudinal and elliptic in shape and around long. It is closely related to Acacia cana which has silvery young phyllodes as well as Acacia coriacea which has longer phyllodes. Taxonomy The species name refers to the calcareous soils with which the species is commonly associated. It was originally misapplied the Acacia coriacea by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1825 in the work Leguminosae. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. The species was first described in 1958 in the work Acacia Calcicola, A New Species of Importance to the Ecology of the Australian Arid Zone. s published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia by the botanists Neville Forde and Ernest Horace Ising. Leslie Pedley described the species as Racosperma calcicola in 1987 in the work Racosperma Martius (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) in Queensland: a checklist published in Austrobaileya. It was reclassified into the current genus in 2006. Distribution Widespread in arid central Australia and is mostly found in an area of desert in the southern Northern Territory and the Goldfields region of Western Australia. with scattered populations also found in south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales. It grows along ephemeral watercourses and on degraded sand dunes as part of low open woodland and tall open shrubland communities. It grows well in heavy calcareous soils usually over limestone and is often associated with Acacia aneura.

Created by Alex Weir in 2003, the concept was to share useful DIY guides and technical information for free using CDs. The name CD3WD comes from \\"CD for the Third World Development\\". In later versions of the project the archive was distributed on DVD. The last version that is available online (the 2012 version) was a total of 6 DVDs (core set) and 32 DVDs of extra educational content. Content of the project CD3WD gathered a massive free electronic library of largely donor-generated information on agriculture, forestry, fisheries, food processing, engineering, appropriate technology, water and sanitation, education, health, etc. This information came mostly from NGOs and governmental agencies. The information was structured into topics and was the 6-DVD core set. The main language of the project was English but there were also parts in other languages. The core set was available from the project's webpage and by DVDs sent by mail. The project also had an educational extra part of 32 DVDs with educational content from sources like Khan Academy, wikipedia for Schools and Project Gutenberg. This part of the project was limited to DVDs sent by mail because most of the content was easy to find online. Survivalists' interest CD3WD was focused on gathering and spreading information to assist third world development, but the project got much of its attention from survivalists. The information in the archive handled a widespread area of practical topics relevant to preppers. This, the structure, and the offline nature of the CD3WD archive made it ideal for survivalists. In 2013 author Annalee Newitz wrote about humans surviving a global extinction event, saying, \\"If we're lucky, the hangers-on will have access to a repository of human knowledge called the CD3WD database.\\" The discontinuation of the project After the death of Alex Weir in 2014, the project stopped and the project domain \\"cd3wd.com\\" was taken over.

The species was one of only twelve placed in the Cortinarius subgenus Cortinarius, along with Cortinarius violaceus. The fruit body has a wide dark violet cap that is convex and becomes flattish with a low, wide boss as it matures. The cap surface is dry and covered with fine scales or hair. This layer on the cap is known as the pileipellis, which is classified as a trichoderm‚Äîhaving parallel hyphae running perpendicular to the surface and forming a layer 8‚Äì20 Œºm wide. The cap colour is lighter towards the cap margin, which is entire and can split or become wavy in older specimens. The flesh is dark purple to black. All mushroom parts stain red in potassium hydroxide. The thick wide dark blue gills are sinuate. The pale violet stipe is high and wide at the top and wide at the base, which is bulbous. The stipe turns dark blue when handled or touched because of the violet universal veil. The mycelium is pale violet. The very warty oval spores are 10.5‚Äì14 Œºm long by 6.5‚Äì9 Œºm wide. The mushroom has no strong aroma. Geography and habitat differences allow it to be distinguished from similar species: the otherwise identical Cortinarius atroviolaceus is found in montane rainforest in Malaysia while Cortinarius atrolazulinus and Cortinarius carneipallidus occur with Nothofagaceae in New Zealand. Cortinarius jenolanensis has a smooth cap. Cortinarius austroviolaceus has less warty spores. The fruit bodies of Cortinarius kioloensis appear in autumn and winter (April to July) under Eucalyptus and Allocasuarina in southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and in association with Leptospermum in New Zealand.

His first taste of professional football management came in 2015 when he was appointed manager of Paris. Playing career Renaud came through the youth system at his hometown club, Nantes, but never broke into the senior team. After playing several games for the reserve side during the 1990‚Äì91 season, he transferred to Championnat de France Amateur (CFA) club Cholet in the summer of 1991. He stayed there for just one season before joining Vertou, where he played for two seasons before retiring from playing in 1994 to take up studies in physical education. Managerial career After almost becoming a teacher, Renaud began his managerial career at the age of 22 when he joined French lower-league club La Haye-Fouassi√®re. In 2001, he returned to his former club Vertou as manager, but left after one season to join Carquefou. While at Carquefou he guided the team to promotion to the CFA twice, in 2004 and again in 2009. In 2008 the team reached the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France, beating established sides including Marseille before being knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain. A highly successful 2011‚Äì12 season in which the team amassed 105 points saw the club promoted to the Championnat National, the third tier of French football, for the first time in their history. Carquefou spent two seasons in the division before being demoted to the regional leagues after experiencing financial difficulties, signalling the end of Renaud's reign. On 5 June 2015, Renaud was appointed manager of newly promoted Ligue 2 side Paris FC, replacing Christophe Taine. Under his guidance, the team won only one of their first sixteen games of the season, a 3‚Äì0 home victory against Le Havre. On 28 November 2015, Renaud was dismissed from his post and replaced by Jean-Luc Vasseur.

Their purpose is to iterate through a tree by working along multiple branches in parallel and merging the results of each branch into one common solution, in order to minimize time spent searching for a value in a tree-like data structure. The original paper was written in 1988 by Chris Ferguson and Richard E. Korf, from the University of California's Computer Science Department. They used multiple other chess AIs to develop this wider range algorithm.  Overview  The Distributed Tree Search Algorithm (also known as Korf‚ÄìFerguson algorithm) was created to solve the following problem: \\"Given a tree with non-uniform branching factor and depth, search it in parallel with an arbitrary number of processors as fast as possible.\\" The top-level part of this algorithm is general and does not use a particular existing type of tree-search, but it can be easily specialized to fit any type of non-distributed tree-search. DTS consists of using multiple processes, each with a node and a set of processors attached, with the goal of searching the sub-tree below the said node. Each process then divides itself into multiple coordinated sub-processes which recursively divide themselves again until an optimal way to search the tree has been found based on the number of processors available to each process. Once a process finishes, DTS dynamically reassigns the processors to other processes as to keep the efficiency to a maximum through good load-balancing, especially in irregular trees. Once a process finishes searching, it recursively sends and merges a resulting signal to its parent-process, until all the different sub-answers have been merged and the entire problem has been solved.  Applications  DTS is only applicable under two major conditions: the data structure to search through is a tree, and the algorithm can make use of at least one computation unit (Although it cannot be considered as distributed if there is only one). One major example of the everyday use of DTS is network routing. The Internet can be seen as a tree of IP addresses, and an analogy to a routing protocol could be how post offices work in the real world. Since there are over 4.3 billion IP addresses currently, society heavily depends on the time the data takes to find its way to its destination. As such, IP-routing divides the work into multiple sub-units which each have different scales of calculation capabilities and use each other's result to find the route in a very efficient manner. This is an instance of DTS that affects over 43% of the world's population, for reasons going from entertainment to national security.  Alternatives  Although DTS is currently one of the most widely used algorithms, many of its applications have alternatives to them which could potentially develop into more efficient, less resource-demanding solutions, were they more researched. One of the more controversial examples is Big-Data processing. In applications like Google Search Engine, Facebook, YouTube, search needs to be optimized to keep waiting time inside a reasonable window. This could be achieved through the plain use of DTS, but other algorithms are used in place (for example data-hashing in SQL databases), or in conjunction (Facebook's Haystack algorithm groups parallel tree-search, data-hashing and memory-ordering/sorting). One of the more important limits of DTS is the fact that it requires a tree as input. Trees are a sub-instance of a data structure known as Graphs, which means every Graph can be converted into a tree. Although there currently exists no better way to search through trees than Korf-Ferguson's algorithm, each task has different particularities and in most cases, there will exist more efficient data structures to represent the problem and solve it than through tree-search. And so there exist instances of tree structures with cycles that cannot possibly be faster than a graph-search on the same structure with the same processing power.  Controversy  There are few controversies around Korf-Ferguson's DTS algorithm, since it is recognized as very complete, but simple. It is very often used as a stepping stone for students to discover the fundamentals and key concepts of distributed problem-solving. The most important challenge to this algorithmic concept was an article by Kr√∂ll B, ¬´ Balanced Distributed Search Trees Do Not Exist ¬ª, which does not attack the veracity or current efficiency of the algorithm, but rather the fact that DTS itself, no matter how many improvements are made to it (for example balancing the input tree before- hand), will never be able to reach optimal resolution-time. This opens a new view point: are too many resources used into the completion of DTS, which blocks new algorithms with higher efficiency-potential from getting researched and developed? Another limit of DTS is the fact that no matter how efficient the division, coordination and merging of the solutions is, it will always be limited by the material number or processors and their processing power. Until recently, this was admitted as being a limit to nearly every computation, but new-generation algorithms like Euclideon might one day be able to crush DFS's efficiency through processing-power-independent problem resolution.

Work Grace Ndiritu - Dreaming the Museum Back to Life In 2012 Ndiritu began creating a new body of works under the title Healing The Museum. It came out of a need to re-introduce non-rational methodologies such as shamanism to re-activate the 'sacredness' of art spaces. Ndiritu believes that most modern art institutions are out of sync with their audiences‚Äô everyday experiences and the widespread socio-economical and political changes that have taken place globally in the recent decades, have further eroded the relationship between museums and their audiences. Museums are dying. Ndiritu sees shamanism as a way to re-activate the dying art space as a space for sharing, participation and ethics. From prehistoric to modern times the shaman was not only the group healer and facilitator of peace but also the creative; the artist. In 2019 Ndiritu led a group of museum directors, academics, activists and artists, in a reading group with meditation at the controversial Africa Museum in Tervuren, Belgium, as part of conference 'Everything Passes Except The Past' organized by Goethe Institut, on the restitution of objects and human remains from Europe back to Congo.https://www.goethe.de/ins/be/fr/ver.cfm?event_id=21542499&fuseaction;=events.detail& =Performance= Reading Group 'Healing The Museum' led by Grace Ndiritu in the Africa Museum, Tervuren 2019 Since 2013 Ndiritu has been doing shamanic performances as part of her visual art practice, as a result of her training in esoteric studies such as shamanism, which she began over 16 years ago.

It is a universal narrative, a creation story from the beginning of Time. Told through photography it tells ‚Äòstories‚Äô between similarly disparate objects and events from the Big Bang until now, by conjuring up and making new connections between them. Abstract photography allows Ndiritu to explore the formalism of the still life genre in such a way that what appears in the microcosm of the photograph is a reflection of what occurs in the macrocosm of the universe. Closely connected to her interests in the moving image, the various themes in AQFM perpetually expand to create photographic constellations. =Painting= Post-Hippie Pop-Abstraction - Works on Paper Ndiritu describes her method of painting as Post-Hippie Pop-Abstraction. It was used as the basis for her SWEATSHOP series of painting installations, which look at the idea of the sweatshop from three juxtaposing yet overlapping angles: Indigenous Tribes who are producing culture and spirituality to feed the New Age movement in the West; The Art Studio - artists who are making objects to feed the art market; Third World Countries - where poorly paid workers make products to feed the luxury, fashion, global consumer market. =Research Projects= COVERSLUT¬© is a fashion and economic research project from Grace Ndiritu founded in 2018. It focuses on dealing with issues of race, gender and class politics. It incorporates Capitalist, PAY WHAT YOU CAN and Ethical/Environmental strategies into its economic framework. It is inspired by her own writings and thinkers such as Muhammad Yunus (micro loans), Charles Einstein (sacred economics), Vandava Shiva (economic feminism), Stewart Brand (Whole Earth Catalog). Ndiritu's use of PAY WHAT YOU CAN in her own art practice has influenced several art institutions including Eastside Projects, Birmingham - Artists Led Multiverse Summithttps://eastsideprojects.org/events/artist-led-multiverse- summit/ and Kunsthal Ghent'shttps://kunsthal.gent/files/users_manual_en.pdf admission fee for their new building and Coventry Biennale, UK in 2019 - to adopt a PAY WHAT YOU CAN policy inspired by Ndiritu's ideas on institutional critique and structural change. The Ark: Center For Interdisciplinary Experimentation, took place from 1 to 10 July 2017 in Paris. Part scientific experiment and part spiritual experience, it focused on the role of art, science, spirituality and politics. In order to encourage creativity and vulnerability and to come up with radical, new ways of thinking about life and the problems of today's world, The Ark had no audience for the first six days, so the 15 participants (scientists, artists, gardeners, economists, chef, spiritual workers) could go deeper into this process. The Ark aimed to firstly open a dialogue between its own participants through a multiplicity of themes including Plants, Biology, Shamanism, Meditation, Food, Philosophy, Communities, Education, Architecture, Future of Cities, Democracy and Activism; and secondly with a wider audience during the Public Weekend - performances, film screenings, BBQ party and Academic Roundtable. =Writing= At age fourteen, Ndiritu was published by Oxford University Press. More recently Ndiritu's experimental art writing has been published by Animal Shelter Journal Semiotext(e) MIT Press. Her political essays A Call To White America: A Response to Donald J. Trump (2016) and Notes To a White Left World: Activism in this Current Political Crisis (2017), Love in The Time of Trump: The Problematics of Kanye West (2018) and essays about museums and exhibition making Healing The Museum (2016) and Ways of Seeing: A New Museum Story for Planet Earth (2017) are published online.https://independent.academia.edu/GraceNdiritu Her online book Dissent Without Modification is a critical theory book, made up of research interviews with interesting, radical, progressive, forward thinking women who started their careers in the 1990s. A mixture of known and unknown American, European and African women working as painters, photographers, performance artists, hackers, activists, and educators. What joins these brilliant women together, aged from their late thirties to their sixties is a sub-textual theme that the decade of the 90's had a culturally significant impact on their politics, creativity, career and personal life choices. It was a creative coming of age period that changed their life's trajectory forever.http://www.dissentwithoutmodification.com/ Press Reviews In April 2017, Grace Ndiritu was interviewed for The Most Amazing People with a candid and revealing interview about death, love, art, grief and River Phoenix.

Tetradrachm The Athenian coinage decree also known as the Standards decree was a decree made by the Athenians to standardise currency amongst the states they were allied with. Between the years of 450 and 447BCE, the use of Athenian silver currency and Athenian weights and measures was made obligatory in all allied states of the Athenian Empire. Scholarly opinion is split in regards to the dating of the Athenian Coinage Decree. Various fragments from cities allied to Athens have been used to reconstruct the decree. The decree required that all allied currencies be taken out of circulation and melted down to be replaced with Attic coins, with a small difference in the exchange rate favouring Athens; the Athenian mint benefited as the allies‚Äô mints were closed down. This encouraged the flow of trade through the Aegean and especially between Athens and the allied states. However, the measure did impinge upon the autonomy of the allied states. The use of Athenian currency had become increasingly common, especially with smaller states, but many continued to mint their own coins with their own state symbol. The result was that the overall volume of trade in the Aegean increased, but with greater domination by Athens.

It is today reduced to the later (castle house); which houses the city archives. It sits on tall foundations and has a tall, black slate roof with further floors in the attic and two small cupolas. The lowland castle abutted the remaining building in the old town quarter. The castle house stands tall, next to the Moselle's right-bank towpath downstream of the strategic Baldwin Bridge (lowest crossing of the river) built in 1342. The bridge, much-repaired, remains intact.  History  Around 1185, on the site of the present castle, the family of von der Arken built a Romanesque residence from the remains of a Roman round tower. Koblenz's city walls, which at that time still corresponded to those of the Late Roman castellum, were extended in 1250. The first record of a Koblenz city council in 1276 was about the citizens' aspirations for more independence. So in 1276 Archbishop Henry II of Finstingen had the Old Castle built as a type of coercion castle out of the structure of the residential building to counter these moves towards greater independence. The castle was partly built on the ruins of the Late Roman city wall dating to the 4th century. From 1281, however, the citizens of Koblenz prevented any further work on the ramparts and castle. Henry II of Finstingen was thus forced to subdue the city and, in 1283, retaliated with armed force. Archbishop Diether of Nassau subjugated the city permanently in 1304 after fierce fighting and Koblenz was forced to dissolve its city council. The construction of the Old Castle was completed in 1307. It was originally surrounded by a broad, water- filled moat and an enceinte. Next to the castle, under Archbishop Baldwin of Luxemburg, construction of the Baldwin Bridge over the Moselle began in 1342. Archbishop Otto von Ziegenhain included the castle in the strong new fortifications of the city with the construction of the western round tower and the bridge gate to the Balduin Bridge. Over the centuries the castle was rebuilt and expanded several times, especially under the Archbishops Baldwin of Luxembourg, Otto von Ziegenhain and Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads. The later Electors of Trier also occasionally used the castle, but it was let out from the early 18th century. From 1779 its fortifications were gradually dismantled. The last resident in the Electoral era was Baron Hugo von Kesselstatt. Under French rule, the castle became state property and was sold to private individuals. In 1806 a sheet metal factory moved into the building, and an extension was built on the city side for the factory operation. In 1897 the factory closed and the castle was sold to the city of Koblenz. Between 1898 and 1900, extensive renovation work was carried out under the direction of the city's chief architect Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwin M√§ckler. The annex was removed from the time of the factory use and the lanterns on the tower roofs were reconstructed. From 1899 to 1923 it was the seat of the Stadtsparkasse Koblenz, later of the municipal welfare office. From 1938 on, the Hitler Youth area management used the castle. It suffered only minor damage in World War II and was completely renovated between 1960 and 1962. The baroque stucco ceilings that had been preserved on the third floor were removed. After the renovation, the Old Castle was used by the city library. From 1980 they shared the buildings with the city archive. After the completion of the \\"Forum Confluentes\\" in 2013, the library moved into the new cultural building on the Zentralplatz, since when the city archive has been the sole user of the castle.

The film stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as a young hunter who encounters and befriends an injured wolf during the last ice age, with J√≥hannes Haukur J√≥hannesson as his father. The wolf Alpha is played by Chuck, a Czechoslovakian Wolfdog.https://pop.inquirer.net/56885/wolf-dogs-lend-genuine-emotional- weight-epic-adventure-alpha Principal photography began in February 2016 in Canada and lasted through that April. The film was delayed several times, before being released in the United States on August 17, 2018, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It has grossed over $99million worldwide and received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the performances and cinematography. Plot In Upper Paleolithic Europe 20,000 years ago, a small tribe of hunter-gatherers prepare for a hunting expedition to hunt for the coming winter's food. Tau, its chief, trains his teenage son Keda, accepting him and another boy to join the hunting party. His wife Rho worries that Keda is not ready, but Tau believes he is and the hunters set out. Tau tests Keda by having him kill a wild boar they've caught, but Keda hesitates. One night, the party's fire draws the attention of a large cave lion,https://www.instagram.com/p/BqiCgdzn7T1/ which lunges through their circle, snatching Keda's friend before anyone can do anything. Hearing the fatal struggle in the darkness, the tribe gives him up for dead. The member is given a memorial service in the form of placing rocks to symbolize the passing of one's spirit to the afterlife. The hunters eventually reach a herd of steppe bison, which they attempt to stampede off a cliff in relative success. Amidst the chaos, the chief bison rushes towards Keda and tosses him over the edge, leaving him gripping the rough cliff edge with his hand. Keda loses his grip and plummets to a further ledge where he appears to break his leg and is knocked unconscious. Tau attempts to climb down to him, but he is stopped by another member of the tribe who assures him in good faith that Keda is dead and there would be no way to reach him nonetheless. The tribe leaves and Tau performs another funeral ritual, stricken with grief. Keda is awoken by a vulture who mistakes him for dead. He kills the bird by wringing its neck and tries to climb the rest of the way down the cliff. A sudden heavy rainfall causes the ravine below to flood. Losing his grip, Keda falls into the water. He survives and splints his injured foot before returning to the top of the cliff. Seeing the memorial cairn left by his tribe, he realizes he must travel back to the village by himself. Keda is later attacked and chased by a pack of ferocious wolves, but escapes up a tree and wounds one of the pack members which the others leave behind. Keda takes pity on it and cares for its injury. Gradually gaining the wolf's trust, he gives it water and then food, establishing himself as dominant by feeding himself first. He sets out for the village without the wolf, but it follows him. Their relationship grows, and they learn to hunt animals together. Along the way, Keda names the wolf Alpha. One night, they are approached menacingly by a pack of wolves. Upon seeing Alpha, who steps forward to greet them, they recognize Keda's companion. The pack run off and with Keda's blessing, Alpha joins them. Keda continues his journey alone as the season changes into winter. On a frozen lake, he encounters a pack of wolves feeding on a carcass. Recognizing Alpha, he runs to them, but the ice breaks and he falls through. Alpha helps rescue him and they are reunited. Continuing the journey together, they find a man who has frozen to death outside his tent and scavenge a bow and arrow from it. Later, they take refuge from a pack of cave hyenas inside a cave. However, inside they are confronted and attacked by another cave lion, causing Alpha to violently fight the animal. Keda saves Alpha by using the bow to kill the lion with the arrow, although Alpha is badly wounded in the fight and now travels with difficulty. Meanwhile, an equally injured Keda begins to cough up blood. When Alpha finally cannot walk, Keda carries the wolf. Keda eventually finds the village while nearly passing out from exhaustion and reunites happily with his shocked, but relieved parents, who are both amazed and proud of him. As the village healer tends to both Keda and Alpha's wounds, Alpha delivers a litter of puppies much to Keda's surprise as Alpha is revealed to be female to him (he had assumed she was male throughout the journey). Alpha and her pups are formally welcomed into the tribe and grow up in the care of Alpha and Keda. In time, the tribe become one of both humans and domesticated wolves, hunting together.

The pardon of Japanese war criminals, among whom were Unit 731's commanding officers General Shiro Ishii and General Masaji Kitano, was overseen by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in September 1945. While a series of war tribunals and trials was organized, many of the high-ranking officials and doctors who devised and respectively performed the experiments were pardoned and never brought to justice. As many as 12,000 people, most of them Chinese, died in Unit 731 alone and many more died in other facilities, such as Unit 100 and in field experiments throughout Manchuria. Historical background Negative sentiments had existed historically between Japan and China, but those rarely materialized in armed conflict prior to the early 1930s. Japanese militarism under Emperor Hirohito had escalated from the Mukden incident in September 1931, when members of the Japanese Imperial Army planted a bomb on a Japanese- owned railway track in Manchuria. They used this \\"attack\\" as a justification for a full-scale invasion of Manchuria and the establishment of the Manchukuo state. The immediate predecessor events of the Manchurian invasion include the abovementioned Mukden Incident and the preceding Wanpaoshan Incident in July 1931, which constituted a dispute between Chinese and Korean farmers in Manchuria. The build-up to the invasion was minimal and involved no deaths on either side of the conflict. The US was mostly unaware of the events that occurred outside the main Pacific theatre, which gave the Japanese army, headed by the Kwantung Army, political and military freedom to take advantage of a technologically and strategically inferior China. American propaganda depicted Japanese militants as sub-human animals, not unlike rodents or snakes. The perception of the Japanese soldier in the US during the war was that of a lowly, depraved and inherently repulsive being, whose depictions in propaganda pieces varied. They were often depicted as animals traditionally associated with depravity and as such intuitively instilled disgust. in contrast, the Chinese, who were allies with the US and fought against Japan during World War II, were depicted positively as noble in American propaganda.https://thediplomat.com/2015/08/when-the-us-and-china-were-allies/ Cover-up The American government sent General MacArthur to oversee rebuilding post-war Japan and the shift to a democracy from a previously feudalist system of governance. MacArthur was also responsible for gathering data on biological warfare, which was obtained through human experimentation. The US government offered full political immunity to high-ranking officials who were instrumental in perpetuating crimes against humanity. Among those was Shiro Ishii, the commander of Unit 731. Hirohito, as emperor, gave his consent regarding the policies and activities of Unit 731, Unit 100 and other human experimentation facilities. He supported the militant agenda, but there is no evidence that he was thoroughly informed on most of the atrocities that occurred within the facilities. He was one of many that would be granted immunity. MacArthur, abiding by the Potsdam Declaration, gathered a jury for the Tokyo trials, where a number of Japanese officials were successfully tried and convicted.

The work was published in 2 volumes that dealt with the extensive investigation into occult matters regarding the apparitions of angels, demons and other spirits. It included dissertations on various topics of Magic, sorcery, witchcraft and instances of vampires, revenants and individuals returning from the grave. This study analyzed accounts of these various topics located in the Bible, mythology, cultural legends and famous accounts of historically documented cases or claims. History The work was first published in 1746 under the title Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des d√©mons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boh√™me, de Moravie et de Sil√©sie. After a great deal of praise and response from his readers, the work was expanded and published with Privilege of the King of France in 1751 under the new title Trait√© sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c..; The new version included letters and dissertations by some of his readers and extra chapters as a response to refutations and various claims. =Publication history= * 1746 Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des d√©mons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boh√™me, de Moravie et de Sil√©sie :::(Dissertations on the apparitions of angels, of demons, and spirits and on Revenants or vampires of Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) * 1751 Trait√© sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c.; :::(Treatise on the apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants of Hungary, Moravia, et al.) Structure The total work consists of 115 chapters contained in two volumes. The dissertation is divided into four parts. In the first, Calmet speaks of good angels. In the second, of the appearance of bad angels. In the third, of the apparitions of souls of the dead. In the fourth, of the appearance of living men to others living, absent, distant, and this unknown to those who appear, occasionally adding research on magic, wizards, and witches, on the Sabbath, oracles, and the obsession and possession by demons throughout the volumes. He used a scientific approach when looking into pre-modern cases of witchcraft, vampires, superstitious beliefs and various other topics of the occult. He delved into the use of the scientific method, biology, psychology, chemistry, etymology and investigated the history of various legends of folklore to determine whether a claim of hauntings, apparitions or magic were truth or fraud. =Tome 1= The treatise as a whole consists of extensive research across a wide range of topics. The first tome contains 52 chapters and mostly deals with the apparitions of spirits, angels and demons while also covering the study of magic, sorcery and witchcraft. Topics also include: * Angelic and demonic intervention * The history, reality and mythology of magic; divination; curses * Understanding the difference between real accounts vs that of impostors * Examples and instances of real possessions caused by the devil * The power and authority which Satan and demons possess * False prophets and predictions of happenstance * The appearance and examinations of specters and pretended specters * Examinations on Specters that haunt houses * The dead who return to the earth * Explanations and objections on the instances of apparitions; * The studies on Familiars; Elves * The secrets of physics and chemistry or Alchemy taken as supernatural things =Tome 2= The second tome consists of 63 chapters and includes a series of letters thereafter. The study includes: * Resurrection of the dead * Instances of people returning from the grave * Examination to people being buried alive but thought to be dead * Historical accounts of revenants, ghosts and vampires * The study of vampires, ghosts in classical mythology and religions * Historically recorded accounts of vampires between the 17th and 18th centuries * Examinations on bodies that do not decay and corpses that show life after death * The power of demons to kill and restore life * On the return of the excommunicated * Instances of bodies that devour their own flesh * Instances on exhumed bodies and their examinations * Analysis on whether vampires or revenants are truly dead * Instances of people returning from the grave months after declared deceased. =Letters= Included in the printing of the second tome were many letters. Some were of approbation but also contained in this collection was a letter written by Marquis of Maffei that was of itself a selected dissertation on magical studies that was written in 16 chapters.  Themes  =Demonic possession= Calmet, doubtful of the circumstances involved in the Loudun Possessions, made a detailed comparison to other cases he believed was more true to the principle symptoms of demonic possession. Mademoiselle Elizabeth de Ranfaing Calmet researched a judicial case that described the possession of Mademoiselle Elizabeth de Ranfaing, who having become a widow in 1617, was later sought in marriage by a physician (afterwards burned under judicial sentence for being a practicing magician). After being rejected, he gave her philters to make her love him which occasioned strange developments in her health and proceeded to continuously give her some other forms of medicament. The maladies which she suffered were incurable by the various physicians that attended her and eventually led to a recourse of exorcisms as prescribed by several physicians that examined her case.p. 138-143. They began to exorcise her in September, 1619. During the exorcisms, the demon that possessed her made detailed and fluid responses in varying languages including French, Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Italian and was reportedly able to know and recite the thoughts and sins of various individuals who examined her. She was further also able to describe in detail with the use of various languages the rites and secrets of the church to experts in the languages she spoke. There was even a mention of how the demon interrupted an exorcist, who after making a mistake in his recital of an exorcism rite in Latin, corrected his speech and mocked him.p. 138-143. =Vampirism= Calmet describes the vampire as a \\"revenant corpse\\" thus distinguishing the intangible ghosts such as phantoms or spirits. He conducted a synthesis of studies on the subject and considers that vampirism is the result of undernourished Balkan.p. 10. As Calmet amassed numerous reports on events of vampires, his attempt to refute false claims of vampirism proved difficult:p. 303-304 > [T]hey see, it is said, men who have been dead for several months, come back > to earth, talk, walk, infest villages, ill use both men and beasts, suck the > blood of their near relations, make them ill, and finally cause their death; > so that people can only save themselves from their dangerous visits and > their hauntings by exhuming them, impaling them, cutting off their heads, > tearing out the heart, or burning them. These revenants are called by the > name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, leeches; and such particulars > are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such > probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly > refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these > revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are > proclaimed of them. Calmet analyzed many famous cases including that of Arnold Paole. Calmet also investigated the Lettres juives in which an account of a vampire had been recorded in 1732 Hungary, witnessed by officers of the tribunal of Belgrade and an officer to the emperor's troops at Graditz. Although the letters were published as an epistolary novel, it was widely believed to be accurate and true records by the populace at the time. Also investigated were various judicial cases of dead persons reported to return from the grave and attack and suck the blood of the living. One such case was in 1730 of a soldier lodged at the house of a peasant in Hungary. As the soldier sat with the homeowner and the rest of the company at the table for dinner, a person he did not know came into the home and quietly sat at the table with them. The homeowner appeared frightened and was discovered deceased the next day. After inquiry, the soldier learned that the father of the homeowner had died and was buried 10 years before and the family believed the man who came the previous night was the father's body.p. 329 The soldier informed the regiment, giving notice to the general officers who commissioned the captain of the infantry to further investigate. The captain, accompanied by other officers, a surgeon and an auditor had recorded dispositions of the family who confirmed the soldier's report and also received dispositions of all the residents of the village. The corpse of the father was ordered to be exhumed and was found to be in the likeness of a man recently deceased but with the blood-flow of a living man. The Count de Cabreras ordered the corpse's head to be cut off and to be reinterred in his tomb.p. 329 The count also received other information of another man dead for more than thirty years that was reported by family to have come back to his house on three separate occasions during meal time. On the first he had sucked the blood from the neck of his brother, the second time from one of his sons, and the third from one of the servants in the house, all three of which had died immediately after. Upon this disposition, the commissary took the suspected corpse from the grave, finding it to be like the first corpse discovered with a living blood-flow and he ordered them to run a large nail through the temple then placed the body back into the grave.p. 330 Reactions and scholarly criticism Calmet's treatise was awarded numerous approbations and letters of criticism following his first publication in 1746, many of which were included in its republication and expanded 1751 version that included new chapters to answer his audience. The treatise received 'Approbation of the King' to the 7th Register on the registry of The Chamber of Royal Booksellers and Printers to Paris on June 9, 1751.p. 579-580 He is mentioned by Voltairep. 52 who in his Dictionnaire philosophique explains: > Calmet became their historian, and treated vampires as he treated the Old > and New Testament, reporting faithfully all that had been said before him  Cultural impact  Calmet analyzed a report that was written from a priest who learned information of a town being tormented by a vampiric entity 3 years earlier. After having traveled to the town to investigate and collect information of the various inhabitants there, the priest learned that a vampire had tormented many of the inhabitants at night by coming out from the nearby cemetery to haunt many of the residents at their beds. An unknown Hungarian traveler came to the town during this time and helped the town by setting a trap at the cemetery which ultimately led to the decapitation of the vampire that resided there and curing the town of their torment. This story was retold by Sheridan Le Fanu and adapted into the thirteenth chapter of the novella Carmilla, a work that heavily inspired Bram Stoker's classic Dracula.

Arad gained her bachelor's degree in visual art from the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem (2010), and a Masters from the School of the art Institute of Chicago (2014).  Artistic practice  In her practice, Arad works to undermine structures of power and authority. Her installations are a result of an ongoing examination and interest in architectural environments and domestic objects. Using the language of the bureaucratic secretarial action, Arad converts architectural structures and foundations into everyday office materials. With an apparatus that is traditionally coded as feminine, she builds and then deconstructs images of masculine power. Arad's conceptually artisanal and time consuming tasks are never immediately showing the amount of energy that the artist invested in their making; quite the opposite they are presented with a degree of nonchalance and carelessness that is deeply organic to Arad‚Äôs position as an artist. This contradictory position‚Äîthe artist as laborious maker of objects empty of any functional, social or aesthetic value‚Äîbecomes even more acute when the result carries a monumental and architectural tone; this is particularly visible in two cases: the first is a series of black lines through which the artist took control of the peculiar shape of the exhibition space hosting her solo show at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2015; the second is EL AL (2012) in which a found image of a Roman arch is printed‚Äîscaled down to 355 x 291 cm‚ÄîXeroxed, shredded and finally exhibited hanging from the ceiling.

Born in Germany, she gained Australian nationality in June 2017. In 2016, Low is the only actively competing female track athlete with two above knee amputations of her legs. Despite the severity of these amputations and despite her having to compete with athletes having one fully functional leg, she successfully made it to the Finals of all of her sprint and long jump competitions at both the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London and the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. In Rio she won the Gold medal with a 4.93m world record distance in the T42 long jump and a Silver medal in the T42 100m competition. Personal history Low was born in Schwerin, Germany. She grew up in Ratzeburg, Germany. In June 2006, at the age of 15, she was struck by a train at a railway platform after losing her balance. The accident severed her left leg and left her in a coma for two months. During life-saving surgery her doctors were forced to amputate her other leg. It took Low two years to relearn to walk using her prostheses. She is married to Australian Paralympic gold medallist Scott Reardon. Sporting career Low enjoyed sports before her accident, and wished to continue playing after. She also stated that she was inspired by American disabled long jumper Cameron Clapp. She took up athletics in 2008 and made her senior sports debut the same year, but broke her elbow in 2009, putting her out of competition for three months. Two years later she was selected for the German national team, travelling to Christchurch in New Zealand to compete at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships. There she finished fourth in the long jump and won bronze in the T42 100m sprint. In 2012 Low qualified for both the 100m sprint and long jump events for the Summer Paralympics in London. The long jump was open across three classifications, F42 to F44, and was decided on a points system. Her best result of 3.93m saw her finish in sixth place. In the sprint she recorded a time of 16.78, which left her just outside the medal positions, finishing fourth behind team-mate Jana Schmidt. Low was disappointed with her performance at the Games and her training in general leading up to the Paralympics. She consulted her trainer, Steffi Nerius, and decided to retire from competitive sport. In 2013, Low visited her friend and fellow German athlete Katrin Green, who was living in the United States and was married to American athlete Roderick Green. While training with the Greens, Low found her passion for athletics rekindled and decided to move to the States, and took Roderick on as her new trainer. By the end of the year she was back representing Germany, this time at the 2013 World Championships in Lyon. There she won two bronze medals, in the 100m sprint and the long jump. The following year saw a major breakthrough in her long jump, when she competed at the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea. Her distance of 4.24m was a big improvement on her previous major competitions, where she had not jumped over four metres. The result saw her win gold, and more importantly, beat her two major world rivals: Schmidt and Italy's Martina Caironi. In the build up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Low competed at the 2015 World Championships in Doha. In the 100m sprint she posted a personal best of 15.41s to win the silver medal, but it was her world record distance of 4.79m in the long jump that not only gave her the gold but also set her out as the athlete to beat at Rio. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, she won the gold medal with a 4.93m world record distance in the T42 long jump and a silver medal in the T42 100m competition with a personal best of 15.17s. At the 2019 World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai, she won the gold medal in the Women's Lonng Jump T61-63 with jump of 4.68m. It was her first major international medal representing Australia. She is coached by Iryna Dvoskina.  Recognition  * 2020 - Awarded Athletics Australia 2019 Female Para-athlete of the Year.

Taking the structure of a love song pastiche, Zappa used the composition to ridicule Peter Frampton's album and single I'm in You. Zappa's parody was directed at Frampton's change from the earnest musician to teen pop idol, replete with bare chested album cover, and syrupy love ballads. The song is in the same vein as the Mothers of Invention's lampooning of the Beatles with We're Only in It for the Money. Lyrically, it describes a sex scene between a boy and girl, \\"I have been in you, baby/And you have been in me\\". Recorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, Zappa later re-recorded the vocals at his personal studio, the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen facility, using a close micing technique. Musically, the bass singer and the bass guitar are giving a counter melody. When Zappa begins singing the song develops into a slow reggae beat. At various points Zappa sings slightly off beat, letting the speech lengths of the syllables prevail, which emphasises the lyrics. In concert, \\"I Have Been in You\\" was usually performed as part of a long medley, featuring \\"Flakes\\" and \\"Broken Hearts Are for Assholes\\".

It was located on Rowe Street about a mile north of downtown Ludington, Michigan. Their main product was haskelite, a plywood made from a waterproof glue developed by Henry L. Haskell in the early 1900s. The plywood was veneer wood panels of different thicknesses and was used to made novelty items, furniture, and paneling for construction. The thinner plywood was molded into shapes for body parts of airplanes and transportation vehicles. It was manufactured with different styles and types to fit particular needs. The company made airplane body parts for military aircraft used in World War I. The manufacturing firm had several subsidiary companies, factories, and offices that were related and supported them. The company was eventually sold off in parts in the mid-20th century. The building where the company was located in Ludington has since been converted to affordable housing.  History  Henry L. Haskell devised a way to make waterproof glue in 1913 from a derivative of dried cow blood. He used this adhesive to put together cross-grained thin veneer layers of wood to create a product referred to as a flat sheet \\"panel\\" ‚Äì now known as plywood (\\"plies\\" of wood). The plywood was named Haskelite after himself. In 1915, he innovated a method to mold this plywood into three dimensional shapes using heat, hydraulic pressure and his patented waterproof glue. Haskell created the Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 in Ludington, Michigan. The Haskelite plywood was first manufactured there. The thinner three-layered plywood pieces could be molded into any shape desired. It was used for various vehicles including airplanes and flying boats. The plywood constructed canoes, boats, trucks, buses, automobiles, and airplanes. The first plane made with moldable plywood was constructed with Haskelite. It was the Curtiss two-place fighter Whistling Bill. Sea sleds and hydro-airplane pontoons were made of haskelite. The \\"panels\\" came in dimensions up to in length. The thickness varied by the number of layers requested. Other uses for the plywood were door panels, roofing, flooring, portable houses, bread boxes, grain chutes, drain boards, toboggans, barrels, shipping containers, refrigerators, and canoes. Haskell in 1917 sold his controlling interest to Bonbright and Company, a group of investment bankers from Detroit and New York City. The company then employed one hundred and eighty men and made ten thousand square feet of plywood per day. They changed the main focus of the company at the beginning of World War I to build military airplane body parts. The Ludington-based plant erected a million dollar expansion to its facilities and increased its employment considerably. The company in 1918 opened its second plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This factory was called the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation. Its main purpose was to supply plywood for the United States and its allies for the construction of military vehicles and aircraft. This factory was twice the size as the original Ludington plant. It employed a thousand men and produced one hundred thousand square feet of plywood per day. Between the two factories, there were millions of feet of plywood produced during World War I. The manufacturing plant in Ludington was part of the larger Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation that was headquartered in Chicago. After the war military aircraft were no longer needed and so this use was discontinued and other uses were found for the plywood. One item the firm built was wooden boats because of the waterproof characteristics of the plywood. Its main product was the Haskell canoe, which was molded from one piece of 3/16th's inch plywood. In the Grand Rapids factory, \\"Plymetl\\" was made as one of several specialty plywood products. It was a wooden plywood faced on one side or both with metal (steel or aluminum). One use for this metal-plywood material was for climate controlled facilities (i.e. fur storage, food storage). Another use was for public restroom facilities. One more type of plywood that the company made was \\"Phemoloid\\". This finished plywood planking was used in houses, commercial facilities, railroad cars, trucks, airplanes, and luxury automobiles. The Grand Rapids factory plant made a deal in 1939 with Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation and the industrialist Howard Hughes to manufacture low-priced airplanes. The manufacturing companies used a special process of heat and pressure to fuse together wood fibers and synthetic resins to make a plywood product for the construction of planes. It was the state-of-the-art in making airplanes and more economical than the currently used method of plane construction. The Haskell company and Fairchild had already developed techniques of molding fuselages and aircraft wings to put together airplanes. Haskell Manufacturing Company had many subsidiaries. One was Marquette Veneer, which made birch Haskelite doors; another company associated was Gillett Log, a Wisconsin company subsidiary that produced the birch wood for door panels. Due to competition the spin-off plant of Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids was sold to an industrial buyer in 1949. The Haskell Company agreed to sell its other assets to Evans Products Company of Plymouth, Michigan at the end of 1956. Haskell building Haskell established the Haskell Manufacturing Company in the building at 801 N. Rowe Street. This building was originally erected by the Mendelson Manufacturing Company in 1892 for making pants. This company was there for two years and went out of business. The building was vacant for nearly a decade and was owned by Antoine E. Cartier. The Tubbs Manufacturing Company occupied the building from 1904 to 1911. The company expanded the size of the structure considerably to accommodate their furniture making business. Haskell's Carrom Company had then moved into this building in 1911 to make the carroms game. The Haskelite building, as the locals refer to it, was occupied by several different businesses after 1934. One of these was the Civilian Conservation Corps. The Wolverine Sportswear Company occupied the building from 1944. Going into the 21st century it has been occupied by the local business Change Parts. These owners donated the building in 2019 for conversion to affordable housing.

He is a 3-time graded stakes winner (Kelso Handicap, the Whitney Handicap and Metropolitan Handicap) and a 2-time Grade 1 winner. Racing career =Early career= Tizway's debut came in a 2-year- old maiden special weight at Aqueduct Racecourse. He came in 6th place and did not run again that year. As a three-year-old, Tizway did not run in any stakes races. His first 4 races he lost. Out of them his best finish was a third. But on the 5th try Tizway won his first race. He never raced again as a three year old. =4-year-old season= After 10 months of rest, Tizway came in 2nd in his return before winning his 2nd race, an allowance. He ran in the Whitney for the first time. This was also the first time Tizway ran in a stakes race. He ended up in 4th. He also was 3rd in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. In his last race as a 4-year-old, Tizway was entered in the Japan Cup Dirt. He finished 12th. =5-year-old season= Tizway started his 5-year-old campaign on April 23, 2010 with a win in an allowance race at Aqueduct, then finished third in the Metropolitan Handicap on May 31. Unfortunately, he then suffered a small fractured wingbone that Dr. Alan Nixon successfully treated. He did not race again until October 3 in the Kelso Handicap, in which he earned his first graded stakes victory. Jockey Rajiv Maragh said, \\"He‚Äôs always been running against some of the best older horses all over and to finally win like this was very good for him. I definitely wanted to get my horse involved because he seems to run better that way, and when I got to the middle of the turn I felt like still had a lot of horse left. Once I called on him in the stretch he just kicked on and finished up powerfully to the wire.\\" He ended the season by finishing fifth in the Breeders Cup Dirt Mile. =6-year-old season= Tizway brought the best in himself in his 6 year old (and final) season. He started off with 2 thirds in the Gulfstream Park Handicap on March 12, 2011 and Charles Town Classic on April 16. He then stepped up to Grade I company in the Metropolitan Handicap on May 30. Tracking a fast pace for the first 6 furlongs, he took a commanding lead coming into the stretch and won convincingly by lengths. The final time of 1:32.90 was just three-fifths of a second off the track record, and less than one-tenth off the stakes record. \\"He tries every time,\\" said trainer H. James Bond. \\"He couldn't stand up on that stuff at Charles Town and still ran a game third and just missed second. Like I say, I'm just fortunate enough to have him in my barn.\\" On August 6, Tizway faced multiple Grade 1 winners in the Whitney Handicap, at a distance ( miles) in which he had only 1 win in 8 starts. At the beginning of the race, Tizway bolted out of the gate and went to the lead, but he then settled behind Friend or Foe and Morning Line. When they hit the far turn, Tizway took command and easily held off Flat Out to win by three lengths. The decisive victory marked Tizway as the interim leader of the 2011 older horse division. Unfortunately, Tizway developed a ligament injury while training for the Breeders' Cup Classic and was subsequently retired. =End of career statistics= At the end of his career, Tizway had an overall career record of 20-7-1-5 and total earnings of $1,359,274. He was an Eclipse Award finalist for 2011 champion older horse, finishing third behind Acclamation with 52 votes. Stud record Tizway was retired to stud at Spendthrift Farm in 2012. He stood his first season for a fee of $15,000. His first foals reached racing age in 2015. His first winner, on August 8, was named Tizzarunner. He finished 2015 as the #21 ranked First Crop Sire, with leading earner Tiz Imaginary ($114,089). As of July 2016, Tizway was a top 10 ranked second crop sire, whose notable offspring included stakes winner Bear'sway. In June 2017, Spendthrift Farm sold Tizway to stand at stud in South Korea, along with fellow former Spendthrift sire Archarcharch. As part of the sale deal, both horses will return to the U.S. when their breeding careers are over. Pedigree Tizway is inbred 5S √ó 4D to Intentionally, meaning Intentionally appears once in the 5th generation of the sire's side of the pedigree and once in the 4th generation of the dam's side. Tizway is also inbred 5S √ó 5S √ó 4D √ó 5D to Northern Dancer.

History A maquette of the medieval town of Porto, with its earlier, \\"Suevan\\"/S√© walls - the Fernandina Walls covered a significantly larger area and reached the riverfront The gate Postigo do Carv√£o dating to 1348 The rectangular watchtowers and visible fortifications A staircase alongside segment of the fortifications Construction of a series of walls began in 1336 in the reign of King D. Afonso IV on the foundations of a small \\"circus\\" that encircled the area of smaller dimensions, reflecting the great development of the burg. The basis of these new walls were marked by an inscription dating 1348 over the gate of Postigo do Carv√£o. This Romanesque wall, was constructed in the 12th century, corresponding to the administrative and urbanistic consolidation of Porto,Real (1993), p.48 after a long period of dispersed population. Of this structure, there are important remains that were not destroyed in the intervening years. Encircling the S√©'s wall (the centre of the medieval town) is an irregular oval, cut by four principal gates, among them the Gate of Vandoma (that was demolished by the municipal council in 1885). The difference between the Romanesque walls and the ones constructed in the 14th century developed in the course of 200 years, as the population grew to about 10000 inhabitants. The city developed in all directions, but primarily towards the west and north, linked by the elevated bridges of Vit√≥ria and Batalha; its growth is easily recognizable in the urban relief. The main line is located in the east, easily visible from the bridge Ponte D. Lu√≠s, and comprises a section of walls with road, protected by two rectangular towers. :\\"The location of the gates of the new wall leaves it very clear the outline of the primitive lines that, of the burgh of the Bishop, which exited to S√£o Jo√£o da Foz and Bou√ßas, Braga, Guimar√£es and Penafiel. In the interwall roadway was the square of S√£o Domingos, with the fundamental circulation in the panorama of internal urban links.\\"Real and Tavares (1993), p.67 In the following centuries, there were many alterations. The majority of these changes affected the gates and lines of communication with the exterior. The construction of these walls were completed during the reign of King D. Fernando in 1376.Almeida (1948) In 1409, the Postigo dos Carros gate was constructed, followed in 1521 by the construction of the Porta Nova dos Carros. This new gate eventually substituted the Postigo da Praia in 1522. By 1529, it was necessary to urgently repair the line of walls between the Porta de Santo El√≥i and Porta do Olival; records from that time suggest that 360 \\"arms-lengths\\" were in a state of ruin. In 1580, a small round fort was constructed on the angle alongside the Porta Nova or Porta Nobre. By 1764, the first repurposing the walls began with the Postigo de Santo El√≥i transformed into a gate, followed in 1768, by the Postigo do Penedo and the Porta do Sol reused and reconstructed, with 45 \\"arms-lengths\\" of wall along the Monastery of Santa Clara. Various gates began to be demolished during this period; in 1774, the Porta da Ribeira was demolished; between 1789 and 1794, the Porta do Olival was destroyed; in 1792, the Porta de Nossa Senhora da Batalha was also taken down; and by 1821, the line of walls that closed the access to the Pra√ßa da Ribeira along the river. In the first half of the 19th century, the walls parallel the river, in front of the urban area of Barredo, was transformed through the opening of a series of arcades separated by small oculi. By 1827, the Porta dos Carros was also demolished, followed in subsequent years by the Postigo do Peixe (or Postigo da Alf√¢ndega Velha); the wall and west of the Gate of Olival, between 1853 and 1854; the Porta Nobre in 1872, in order to open the Rua Nova da Alf√¢ndega; and the demolition of the Porta do Sol in 1875. By 1888, there still remained corbels along the Porta dos Carros. In the 20th century, the medieval walls were recuperated, during a revivalist campaign of restoration, that was characterized by the Estado Novo. This work occurred between 1959 and 1962, with priority along the cliff of Guindais. During this work, a Gothic house-tower was discovered along Rua de D. Pedro Pit√µes, alongside the S√© Cathedral. Restored by Rog√©rio de Azevedo, it became the ex-libris of the medieval military structures of the city, initially sheltering the Gabinete de Hist√≥ria da Cidade (city historical cabinet). More recently, a few archaeological interventions contributed decisively to a better understanding of the Portuense military evolution. Architecture A view of the ancient walls and staircase of Morro da S√© Many of the structures, including walls and towers, are integrated into the buildings of the old town, with the main wall being the Guindais wall and tower, relatively isolated over the margin of the river. The best remaining example of the Fernandino wall fortifications is preserved in the cliffs of Guindais, over the river, until the monastery of Santa Clara, following the Postigo do Carvalho, to the Postigo de Santo Ant√≥nio do Penedo and later the gate of Porta do Sol. The lines continued through the local community to the Governo Civil and the Teatro de S. Jo√£o, passing along the Rua de Cimo de Vila, where a gate with the same name existed. The fortifications then extended east to west at this point, crossed the Cal√ßada de Sta. Teresa and the Viela da Madeira where some covered remains, until Postigo (later Porta) dos Carros. The walls continued to the extinct Convent of L√≥ios, today the actual building of the Cardosas, where the Porta de Santo El√≥i was located. From there the fortifications followed to the Cal√ßada dos Cl√©rigos and Rua da Assun√ß√£o until the Cordoaria (in the Campo M√°rtires da P√°tria), where the Porta do Olival, the principal entryway to Braga and Viana do Castelo was located. Of this last line and gate some of the remains are integrated into constructions. The walls then descended to the river, where some remains were conserved behind the homes that fronted the Rua das Taipas and Rua de Dr. Barbosa de Castro. Alongside the Largo das Virtudes existed a gate also, of the same name. It then continued in the direction of the river, behind the Palace of S√£o Jo√£o Novo, where the gate of Porta de Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa. Here also, there were preserved walls, like along the Escadas do Caminho Novo that terminated at the river. Before the walls inflected to parallel the river east to west, existed the Postigo da Praia, later transformed into the Porta da Praia, Porta Nova or Porta Nobre, and preserved into the Soares dos Reis Museum. On the lines paralleling the river, there were a number of towers: Postigo dos Banhos, Postigos do Pereira (or Lingueta), Postigo da Alf√¢ndega, Postigo do Carv√£o (the only one still preserved), the Postigo do Peixe, the Porta da Ribeira, and later four towers, the Postigo do Pelourinho, the Postigo da Forca, the Postigo da Madeira and the Postigo da Areia (alongside the escarpment of the Guindais) where it rose toward the north. The walls are considerably modified, through a number of passages cut or carved into the walls; many walls are conserved, especially along the river, being knowing as the Muro da Ribeira or Muro dos Bacalhoeiros.

It was located on Broadway Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They manufactured haskelite plywood for a wide variety of applications and vehicles. Their office headquarters were located in Chicago, Illinois. The Grand Rapids corporation was a spin-off from the Haskell Manufacturing Company in Ludington, Michigan. It was a factory twice the capacity at over 100,000 square feet and designed to make up to ten times as much plywood per day as the Ludington facilities. The plywood at the beginning was needed for World War I military airplane body parts. The plywood later was used in houses, buildings, automobiles and ship construction. Different styles and types of plywood were made for particular niches. The corporation made the largest plywood ever produced, which was used in constructing a particular US Navy boat. A well known use for the Haskelite plywood produced at the Grand Rapids facilities was for the construction of the Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindberg's plane.  Background  Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation was formed in late 1917 as a spin-off from the Haskell Manufacturing Company of Ludington. Its main purpose was to fulfill World War I needs for mass production of Haskelite plywood. The Ludington factory of 100 men was producing less than of plywood per day, while the new Grand Rapids factory, with 1,000 men, was designed to produce up to of plywood per day. During World War I Haskell manufactured airplane bodies for the American, British and French armies. Over of Haskelite plywood was produced by 1918 for military airplanes. The plant was located on of land near the Grand Rapids Fuller Station. This station was a railway passenger depot served by the Grand Trunk Western Railway, Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway, Pere Marquette Railway and local street-line railway. Plywood airplane fuselage construction A temporary trust company, the Factory Construction Company of Grand Rapids, was used to assist the formation of the corporation. It sold stocks and bonds to raise the necessary money to build the new Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation factory building. The new factory cost $250,000 of which $150,000 in bonds were sold and $100,000 in stocks were sold to raise the necessary money to build the factory. The new Grand Rapids factory was twice the capacity of the original factory in Ludington. It was located at 1850‚Äì1950 Broadway Ave in the northwest corner of the city. The title to the property itself temporarily stayed in the trust company. It made a 10-year lease to Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation and they paid a rent of 8% net profits. At the end of the lease, Haskelite Corporation bought the property and retired the trust company. The main offices of Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation were in Chicago where the executive office of George R. Meyercord, the president, was located. James R. Fitzpatrick, the corporate secretary and general sales manager, also had his main office there. Emory W. Stoner, district sales manager, had his offices in Detroit, Michigan. The corporation reported sales in 1941 as 60 per cent higher than in 1940. The net total was $5,600,000, a substantial increase from the previous 20 years. Stoner in 1944 received a promotion to sales manager and moved to Grand Rapids. Spirit of St. Louis The original Haskelite plywood was used in commercial buildings, houses, ship construction and airplane bodies before 1920. By 1922 there were over seventy car manufacturers using Haskelite in one form or another. The plywood material that built most of the Spirit of St. Louis‚ÄîCharles Lindbergh's plane that made a non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927‚Äîwas made at Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The plywood components for the British fighter bomber de Havilland Mosquito plane came from Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation. The new Haskelite factory was a one-story building of nearly ‚Äî. It was started in construction in January 1918. The ground was frozen from the cold Michigan winter, but work commenced anyway due to the urgent wartime need. New roads were made to the construction site for the teams of horses that supplied the material. There were as many as 75 teams of horses coming and going to the site daily. The building was completed and occupied by April, a record time for building construction in Grand Rapids.  Specialty plywood  Haskelite panel, is largest plywood panel ever made in the world The largest plywood panels ever made were manufactured by the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation. They were built for a US Navy boat designed to go over . The panels were made of veneers with mahogany on the faces and a Spanish cedar center core. The thicknesses of the plywood panels were from . They ranged in area from 30 square feet to over . The largest dimension was long. Different styles and types of plywood were developed for specific niches after 1930. Some of these were for boat hulls, doors, household refrigerators, street cars, and freight trailers. Among the dozens of new plywood materials were the brand names of KarVarT, Plymetl, Plymold, and Phemaloid. = Plymetl = left Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation made a plywood consisting of additional layers of metal sheet plating (steel, aluminum and copper) and were branded Plymetl (plywood + metal). Plymetl plywood was used where a strong lightweight material was needed with a high resistance to impact. It was used to make clothes vaults and storage facilities. It was also used in ships, yachts, aircraft and vehicles‚Äìespecially luxury automobiles. During WWII, plywood from the Grand Rapids factory was a major contributor to the war effort in the construction of military vehicles, combat ships, fighter airplanes and tanks. = Plymold = Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation was involved with the development of a plastic veneer plywood called Plymold. It was known also as duramold plywood by the Fairchild Engine and Aircraft Corporation. These veneer wood pieces were infused with phenolic resin synthetics for extra strength. They could be shaped into three dimensions which was advantageous for airplane and ship parts. Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation added of floor space to their existing building in Grand Rapids in 1942. The main purpose for this was the need for special shaped plywood pieces for WWII military airplane body parts and ship interior parts. The plymold material was also used in railway cars, buses, automobiles, and boats.

It was fire- resistant and constructed electrically. It had high resistance to moisture, was of high tensile strength, and had fungi destroying properties. Airplane parts were among the uses for this plywood. It was also used in railroad cars.  Hasko trays  Hasko mystic tray Haskelite also manufactured a variety of serving trays with flower, animal, and cartoon themes. Walter F. Gibian, supervisor of Haskelite's Specialty Division, had the idea for the product. His goal was to make economical serving trays for the general public through mass production. Up until this time serving trays were considered a luxury item. Sales of the line exceeded expectations. The next products Haskelite manufactured were in the toy market under the brand name \\"Hasko.\\" These consisted of \\"fortune telling\\" mystic trays and boards that were so called \\"talking boards\\" of the future. These included models of the Mystic Tray, Mystic Egyptian style Board, and the Hasko Mystic Board with different zodiac borders. \\"Hasko\\" was one of the prolific producers of these mystic \\"talking boards\\" in the world.

It preceded the Siege of Lachish, making it the first known clash between the two kingdoms during Sennacherib's campaign in Judah. Background Several kingdoms in the Levant ceased to pay taxes to the Assyrian King, Sennacherib; as a result, he set out on a campaign to once again subjugate the rebelling kingdoms, among them the Jewish Kingdom of Judah led by King Hezekiah. After defeating the rebels of Ekron in Philistia he set out to subjugate Judah and in his way to Jerusalem he came across Azekah, among the most important Jewish cities.

There were also hired mercenaries throwing stones. The infantry was highly trained and worked alongside military engineers in order to breach sieges. *Cavalry; the Assyrian cavalry was among the finest in the ancient Middle East and included both close-combat cavalry with spears and mounted archers which could both use the agility of the horses alongside long-range attacks. *Chariots, which were better equipped for open land-engagements than sieges. =The Jewish army= File:PLATE4CX.jpgModern depiction of a Jewish King and troops The Jewish military force was dwarfed compared to the large, professional Assyrian army. Jewish forces mostly included local militias and mercenaries. There were barely any cavalrymen and chariots in the Jewish army, which mostly included infantry, either for close combat (spearmen) or long range combat (archers); they were also significantly less organized than the Assyrians. The battle The battle is depicted in the Azekah Inscription, in which Sennacherib mentions some details about the battle. He mentions that he used battering rams to bring down the walls which was followed by close quarters combat between the opposing sides' infantry. Afterwards, Sennacherib ordered his cavalry to charge into the city, leading many of the defenders to rout. Sennacherib then looted and razed the city. Aftermath After the destruction and looting of Azekah, Sennacherib led his army further into Judah, which he once again commanded during the Siege of Lachish.

Construction  SS Tabora was built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany. She was launched on 18 April 1912, and completed on 29 June 1912. The ship was long and had a beam of . She was assessed at and had two triple- expansion engines driving double screw propellers.  Early career  During her early career, Tabora steamed many times from German East Africa to Germany and sometimes from South Africa to Southampton in the United Kingdom. In 1914, when World War I broke out, Tabora was converted into a hospital ship for the German colonies in East Africa. = World War I and sinking = The British suspected that Tabora was not really a hospital ship, but rather operated as a troopship or ammunition transport ship, disguised as a hospital ship with her sides painted with the Red Cross emblem. On 26 March 1916, in the port of Dar es Salaam in German East Africa, the Royal Navy battleship and protected cruisers and and the Royal Australian Navy light cruiser approached Tabora. The British demanded that the Germans allow them to inspect Tabora to confirm or debunk their suspicions about her. The Germans did not reply. Pioneer received orders to open fire if the German ship made any suspicious move. After time had passed without a reply from Tabora, Pioneer received orders to fire four warning shots from her 4-inch (102-mm) guns. At the same time, Vengeance signaled Tabora asking her to evacuate any wounded she had on board. When Tabora still did not answer, the British ships and Pioneer opened fire on her. An avalanche of shells hit Tabora, and she quickly caught fire. She was shrouded in thickening clouds of black smoke, took on a list to port, and began to sink. The British ships and Pioneer then steamed away without any return fire from the Germans. Tabora rolled onto her side and came to rest on the harbor bottom on her port side, with her starboard side remaining above water. It is unknown if anyone died on Tabora.  Aftermath and wreck  The sinking of Tabora went virtually unnoticed by the public. The German Empire did not protest against the British and Australian action, nor did they even publish a statement about the incident. Germany's behavior after the incident indicated that Tabora probably was not a hospital ship within the meaning of Articles X and XI of the Hague Convention of 1907, and that her sinking had not violated international maritime law. The burned-out wreck of Tabora remained in the harbor of Dar es Salaam until 1955, when she finally was scrapped by the Italian salvage company Mawa Handels Anstalt nearly 40 years after her sinking.

He has developed several media and tech businesses and made innovative use of online technologies. In 2016, he co-founded the company Votecastr to track the 2016 presidential election in real time. The company published the results of turnout tracking at poll locations online throughout the day. However, the platform experienced numerous difficulties during its inception and ultimately proved inaccurate in its execution. Most predictions made by Votecastr fell short of reality. Early life and education Cornwell was born in New York City and grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he attended Hastings High School. From 1982 to 1987 he attended the Johns Hopkins University, where he received a B.A. in Russian. Career =Early career= Cornwell worked as a scheduler for Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1982-84. He founded the non-profit National Service League, which sought to aid the transition to democracy in Eastern Europe, and ran it from 1990 to 1994. He also founded Central Europe Today, a radio news program broadcast from Budapest, and ran it from 1994 to 1996 during which time he lived in Budapest. He worked in sales and development at America's Promise in 1996-97. At America‚Äôs Promise, founded by Colin Powell, Cornwell made $5,000 a month. =Skyjet= In 1997 Cornwell founded Skyjet, a reservation system for business jets, and served as its president until 2002. The idea for Skyjet came to him while bicycling eight miles to work in Washington, D.C., while he was employed at America's Promise. On that daily bicycle ride, he passed Reagan National Airport, where there were plenty of private planes sitting unused. ‚ÄúAnd it started to occur to me that there was probably a more efficient way to be able to use those planes rather than just having them sit on the ground for days at a time.‚Äù From 2002-4, Cornwell was vice president for strategy and business development of Business Jet Solutions, Bombardier Aerospace, which purchased Skyjet from him for five million dollars. Skyjet is now owned by Directional Aviation. Andrew Warner of Mixergy has described Cornwell as ‚Äúa guy who could barely afford the price of a FedEx envelope to ship out his business plan to investors‚Äù but who managed nonetheless to build ‚Äúa hit charter jet company‚Äù, namely Skyjet. =Broadband= Cornwell founded Broadband Television Network in 2005, and was its president until 2007. =appbackr.inc= In December 2009, Cornwell founded appbackr.inc, a wholesale market exchange for apps. According to its website, ‚Äúappbackr‚Äôs mission is to index the world‚Äôs apps, enabling app users to make informed and inspired decisions, and making apps accessible to everyone through the App Anatomy‚Ñ¢ Project.‚Äù He is still CEO of that Palo Alto- based firm, which helps publishers and platforms identify the right apps to optimize revenue. appbackr won the PayPal X Developer Challenge; it is an OnMobile 100 Company and an AlwaysOn 250 Company. =Other professional activities= Cornwell was deputy political director of the U.S. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee under the chairmanship of John F.

His principal subject matter is children playing in landscapes with classical objects. His works show the influence of Poussin's Arcadian landscapes and bacchanals, which were ultimately derived from Titian's bacchanals.M. Newcome. \\"Podesta, Giovanni Andrea.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 May 2016 Life Giovanni Andrea Podest√† was born in Genoa. He was formed in Genoa with Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari and Domenico Fiasella according to the information provided by the contemporary Genoese biographer Raffaele Soprani. He is also recorded as an apprentice of Giovanni Battista Paggi in 1627.Giovanni Andrea Podest√†, Allegoria della Musica at Wannenes Drunken Silenus His presence is documented from in 1634 in Rome where he made drawings after the statues and ancient reliefs at the famous Giustiniani collection. These were subsequently engraved for publication in the 'Galleria Giustiniani'. The artist's career ran a course similar to that of the young Domenico Fiasella. In Rome his art evolved in contact with the works of Poussin, Andrea di Leone, Pietro Testa and the Flemish artists Fran√ßois Duquesnoy and Karel Philips Spierincks. In 1650 Podesta became a member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He died in Genoa. Work A majority of Podest√†'s paintings depict children playing amid classical objects in landscapes. Few of his paintings have survived and his work is now mainly known from the etchings he made himself after his compositions. In particular a series of prints published in Rome which date from 1636 to 1661 form an important source of information on his work. Putti in a Landscape Podest√† made prints after the bacchanals of Titian, which he dedicated to powerful patrons. He dedicated a series of prints to the pleasures of wine to Paolo Giordano Orsini II, Prince of Bracciano. Orsini also owned multiple paintings by Podest√†, including two landscapes and seven small paintings of seafood. A Worship of Venus etched after Titian was dedicated to Cassiano dal Pozzo and other prints of bacchanals to Fabio della Cornia. The artist clearly tried tocurry favour with the Barberini family through these dedications.Maria H. Loh, Titian Remade: Repetition and the Transformation of Early Modern Italian Art, Getty Publications, 2007, p. 69 Cassiano dal Pozzo was known for his archaeological interests. Podest√†'s acquaintance with Cassiano dal Pozzo may have played a role in Podest√†‚Äôs artistic development and may have put him in the circle of Poussin. This circle included Flemish artists such as the sculptor Fran√ßois Duquesnoy and the painter Karel Philips Spierincks who at one time or the other shared a home in Rome and also had common artistic interests.Giovanni Andrea Podest√†, Bacco e Arianna at Arte Antico Silvia Danesi Squarzina, A 'Hagar and the Angel' by Carel Philips Spierinck in Potsdam, in: The Burlington Magazine, June 1999 (Number 1155 ‚Äì Volume 141) In this circle there was an interest in Classicism as well as a growing interest and admiration for the bacchanals of Titian. This found expression in copies and reproductions after Titian as well as new compositions inspired by the theme of the bacchanals. The mutual influence of the artists in this circle is clear from the fact that Podest√† 's Bacchus and Ariadne (At Arte Antico) cites in the putto who scares another putto with a mask similar figures in a Drunken Silenus of the Flemish painter Karel Philips Spierincks. Landscape with a Bacchanal of Putti and a Goat The quality of his work and its closeness to the Poussin circle was such that it is often difficult to distinguish his work from compositions by Poussin and Spierincks. His work has considerable charm, a feature sometimes lacking in the work of his more illustrious contemporaries. One scholar noted that 'Although Podest√† was neither a great designer nor a great draughtsman, his amusing conceits display the lighter side of the often sober classical devotees in Rome in the 1630s and 1640s.'Giovanni Andrea Podest√†, Landscape with a Bacchanal of Putti and a Goat, Stephen Ongpin Fine Art Although a rather marginal artist, his works depicting putti at play definitely had an influence on late Genoese Baroque painting, such as on the decorative artists of the 'Casa Piola'. The few drawings by Podesta that have been preserved show features familiar from his etchings: contorted facial expressions, small twisting figures, patches of dark cross-hatching and an interest in still- life. In their precision they are similar to and possibly derived from Sinibaldo Scorza, whose prints may have been an inspiration for Podest√†'s own etchings.

But also simply ‚Äúwomen‚Äù, unaware stars of our time, who have nothing to do with video cameras or glossy magazines, but are the protagonists of real life; the choice of their faces is determined by the femininity, sensuality, perseverance or pain coming from their glances. The detail of some glances painted on oversize canvases lets her suspended between the sweetness and violence of the contradictions of the time we are living. She has recently developed two new concepts. In the first, the face fades out thanks to play of shades, where it is only the eyes or the eyes and lips to stand out with bodily arrogance. In the second, she has tried to develop a technique between painting and drawing, with signs of grease pencil on oil paints. Artistry Pellin's artistry is best expressed in these words, Cinzia Pellin from some time, is going on a course tending to analyze more and more closer the female universe: a way of inner temper, a kaleidoscope full of charm and enticement, a planet dissected in a myriad of splinters, that get near and far, in the endless play of existence.

History Oklahoma Joe's can be traced to competition barbecue and the Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS). Tagging along with friends at the American Royal and The Great Lenexa BBQ Battle was all the inspiration Jeff Stehney needed to get started cooking on his own. The first smoker purchased was an Oklahoma Joe‚Äôs 24‚Äù smoker, christened in April 1991. The competition team, Slaughterhouse Five, won eight Grand Championships, including the prestigious American Royal BBQ, three Reserve Grand Championships, and the KCBS‚Äôs Grand Champion ‚ÄúTeam of the Year‚Äù in 1993. Over the next several seasons Slaughterhouse Five won dozens more awards and was generally recognized as one of the top competition BBQ teams in the country. While on the competition circuit, the Stehneys became friends with Joe Davidson, founder and owner of the Oklahoma Joe's Smoker Company. Jeff and Joe decided to go into business together and opened Oklahoma Joe's in Stillwater, Oklahoma in 1996. Later that same year in August, they also opened the first Kansas City area location inside a gas station at the corner of 47th Avenue and Mission Road in Kansas City, Kansas that was formerly home to a fried-chicken- and-liquor-store operation known as One Fast Chick-n. In 1997, Joe Davidson sold his smoker company and moved to Texas. With none of the owners located in Oklahoma, the partners decided to closed the Oklahoma location, and then Jeff and Joy Stehney bought out Joe's share of the Kansas City restaurant operation. In 2005, the Stehneys opened their second Oklahoma Joe's restaurant in a former nightclub space at 119th & Strang Line Road in Olathe, Kansas. Joe Davidson moved back to Oklahoma, and after 14 years out of the restaurant business he re-opened his own version of Oklahoma Joe's in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma in 2011, followed by a second location in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2012. While the new Oklahoma restaurant's were using the same Oklahoma Joe's name as the Kansas City area restaurants, the different owners had distinctly different menus and variations in recipes. The Stehneys did not own rights to the Oklahoma Joe's name outside of the Kansas City area, and they became concerned that the operations of other locations could dilute the brand of their operations in Kansas City. The Stehneys met with Davidson and agreed to change the name of their restaurants. Joe's slowly began the process of removing \\"Oklahoma\\" from its name in 2011 when it released Joe‚Äôs Kansas City Bar-B-Que Sauce, without \\"Oklahoma\\" in the name. The change was followed by the release of Joe‚Äôs Original French Fry Seasoning, again without any mention of \\"Oklahoma\\" in the logo. T-shirts sold by the restaurant also began to display the name \\"Joe‚Äôs Kansas City Bar-B-Que\\". In August 2014 Joe's made the official announcement that the name on their three Kansas City area restaurants would be changed to Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que as of November 17, 2014. The Stehney's ownership and operation of the restaurants remains unchanged. In July 2012, Joe's opened a third location in Leawood, Kansas. The Leawood restaurant is located near 119th and Roe Ave in an extensively remodeled building that formerly housed a TGI Friday's. Awards * Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain listed Joe's original Kansas City location as one of \\"13 Places You Must Eat Before You Die.\\" * Men's Health magazine named Joe's as America's manliest restaurant. * Joe's was named \\"Kansas City's Best Barbecue\\" by Zagat. * USA Today said the ribs were the ‚ÄúTastiest Ribs in America * Food review site Yelp ranked Joe's Kansas City No. 3 in the top 100 places to eat in the U.S * Thrillist named Joe's among the \\"33 Best BBQ Joints in America\\" in 2013 and 2016 * Author and food critic Johnny Fugitt awarded Joe's the number three ranking in his 2015 book titled The 100 Best Barbecue Restaurants in America * Travel review website TripAdvisor awarded Joe's the number two ranking among their list of the top 10 BBQ restaurants for 2015. * On July 30, 2014, Joe's Kansas City filled a $1,400 order for President Barack Obama, which was picked up by Air Force One staff * The New York Post named Joe's number one on its list of the 28 best BBQ restaurants in America in July 2017.

Climbs Ball was a New Zealand Antarctic Division field guide and instructor in survival training at Scott Base in 1976‚Äì77 and a field guide in northern Victoria Land for the GANOVEX expedition in 1979‚Äì80. He also climbed Aoraki (Mt Cook) 26 times, at that time a record. In 1989 Gary Ball tried unsuccessfully to climb Mount Everest. In 1990 Gary Ball summited Mount Everest with Peter Hillary and Rob Hall. They made a call from the summit to a New Zealand television station for an on-air talk during prime time. On return to New Zealand they appeared in parades and gained corporate sponsorships for additional climbs. With Hall, Ball climbed the Seven Summits in seven months in 1990. Together, Ball and Hall founded Adventure Consultants in 1991, and were among the pioneers of guided tours of Mount Everest. Hall and Ball had climbed 16 mountains together and were celebrities in New Zealand for their climbing exploits. In 1990, Ball was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 1992, Ball also attempted K2 but was struck down by a pulmonary embolism. He was rescued from 8300 metres altitude over the course of several days initially by Rob Hall and later by a team including Dan Mazur, Scott Fischer, Ed Viesturs, Neal Beidleman and Jon Pratt . Death Dhaulagiri Ball died in October 1993 after coming down with high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) while climbing Himalayan mountain Dhaulagiri with Hall. Hall buried Ball's body in a crevasse on the mountain, and it was rediscovered ten years later. In 2004 his family members planned a trip to re-bury the body. Legacy Ball Glacier is a long glacier in Victoria Land, Antarctica named by the New Zealand Geographic Board after Ball. Ball climbed Mount Lister with an Italian field party in 1976‚Äì77, and camped on this glacier; he was field assistant with R.H. Findlay‚Äôs New Zealand Antarctic Research Program party to this area, 1980‚Äì81. Ball Peak is a mountain named by the New Zealand Geographic Board after Ball. This was related to his time as a New Zealand Antarctic Division field guide and instructor in survival training at Scott Base in 1976‚Äì77 and as a field guide in northern Victoria Land for the GANOVEX expedition in 1979‚Äì80. Ball peak is a mountain tall at the head of Loftus Glacier in the Asgard Range, Victoria Land, Antarctica. It stands in proximity to Mount Hall and Harris Peak, with which this naming is associated.
