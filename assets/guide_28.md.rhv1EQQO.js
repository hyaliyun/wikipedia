This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class \`T\` and a type variable \`a\`, and means that \`a\` can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with \`T\`. Type classes were first implemented in the Haskell programming language after first being proposed by Philip Wadler and Stephen Blott as an extension to \\"eqtypes\\" in Standard ML, and were originally conceived as a way of implementing overloaded arithmetic and equality operators in a principled fashion. In contrast with the \\"eqtypes\\" of Standard ML, overloading the equality operator through the use of type classes in Haskell does not require extensive modification of the compiler frontend or the underlying type system. Since their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.  Overview  Type classes are defined by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class \`Eq\` intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way: class Eq a where () :: a -> a -> Bool (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool where \`a\` is one instance of the type class \`Eq\`, and \`a\` defines the function signatures for 2 functions (the equality and inequality functions), which each take 2 arguments of type \`a\` and return a boolean. The type variable \`a\` has kind * (also known as \`Type\` in the latest GHC release),\`Type\` from \`Data.Kind\` appeared in version 8 of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler meaning that the kind of \`Eq\` is Eq :: Type -> Constraint The declaration may be read as stating a \\"type \`a\` belongs to type class \`Eq\` if there are functions named \`()\`, and \`(/=)\`, of the appropriate types, defined on it.\\" A programmer could then define a function \`elem\` (which determines if an element is in a list) in the following way: elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool elem y [] = False elem y (x:xs) = (x  y)  elem y xs The function \`elem\` has the type \`a -> [a] -> Bool\` with the context \`Eq a\`, which constrains the types which \`a\` can range over to those \`a\` which belong to the \`Eq\` type class. (Note: Haskell \` => \` can be called a 'class constraint'.) A programmer can make any type \`t\` a member of a given type class \`C\` by using an instance declaration that defines implementations of all of \`C\`'s methods for the particular type \`t\`. For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type \`t\`, they may then make this new type an instance of \`Eq\` by providing an equality function over values of type \`t\` in whatever way they see fit. Once they have done this, they may use the function \`elem\` on \`[t]\`, that is, lists of elements of type \`t\`. Note that type classes are different from classes in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, \`Eq\` is not a type: there is no such thing as a value of type \`Eq\`. Type classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of \`elem\` as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type \`a -> [a] -> Bool\` were it not for the type class constraint \\"\`Eq a =>\`\\".  Higher-kinded polymorphism  A type class need not take a type variable of kind \`Type\` but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as \`Maybe\`, rather than data constructors such as \`Just\`). An example is the \`Monad\` class: class Monad m where return :: a -> m a (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b The fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind \`Type -> Type\`, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type, the kind of \`Monad\` is thus: Monad :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint  Multi-parameter type classes  Type classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types.Haskell' page MultiParamTypeClasses. For example, in the GHC standard library, the class \`IArray\` expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint \`IArray a e\` means that \`a\` is an array type that contains elements of type \`e\`. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement unboxed array types, for example.) Like multimethods, multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types. Multi-parameter type classes do not require searching for the method to call on every call at runtime;In GHC, the C Core uses Girard & Reynold's System F type signatures to identify a typed case for processing in the optimization phases. -- Simon Peyton-Jones \\"Into the Core - Squeezing Haskell into Nine Constructors\\" Erlang User Conference, Sep 14, 2016 rather the method to call is first compiled and stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single- parameter type classes. Haskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard. The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and Hugs, support multi-parameter type classes.  Functional dependencies  In Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters--a concept inspired from relational database theory.Mark Jones. Type Classes with Functional Dependencies. From Proc. 9th European Symposium on Programming. March, 2000.Haskell' page FunctionalDependencies. That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, a general monads \`m\` which carry a state parameter of type \`s\` satisfy the type class constraint \`Monad.State s m\`. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency \`m -> s\`. This means that for a given monad \`m\` of type class \`Monad.State\`, the state type accessible from \`m\` is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in type inference, as well as aiding the programmer in type-directed programming. Simon Peyton-Jones has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell- prime/2006-February/000289.html  Type classes and implicit parameters  Type classes and implicit parameters are very similar in nature, although not quite the same. A polymorphic function with a type class constraint such as: sum :: Num a => [a] -> a can be intuitively treated as a function that implicitly accepts an instance of \`Num\`: sum_ :: Num_ a -> [a] -> a The instance \`Num_ a\` is essentially a record that contains the instance definition of \`Num a\`. (This is in fact how type classes are implemented under the hood by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.) However, there is a crucial difference: implicit parameters are more flexible – you can pass different instances of \`Num Int\`. In contrast, type classes enforce the so-called coherence property, which requires that there should only be one unique choice of instance for any given type. The coherence property makes type classes somewhat antimodular, which is why orphan instances (instances that are defined in a module that neither contains the class nor the type of interest) are strongly discouraged. On the other hand, coherence adds an additional level of safety to the language, providing the programmer a guarantee that two disjoint parts of the same code will share the same instance.Edward Kmett, Type Classes vs. the World, Boston Haskell Meetup. As an example, an ordered set (of type \`Set a\`) requires a total ordering on the elements (of type \`a\`) in order to function. This can be evidenced by a constraint \`Ord a\`, which defines a comparison operator on the elements. However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order. Since set algorithms are generally intolerant of changes in the ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of \`Ord a\` to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes). Thus, enforcing coherence of \`Ord a\` in this particular scenario is crucial. Instances (or \\"dictionaries\\") in Scala type classes are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity. While these instances are by default supplied by finding appropriate instances in scope to be used as the implicit actual parameters for explicitly-declared implicit formal parameters, the fact that they are ordinary values means that they can be supplied explicitly, to resolve ambiguity. As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters. This is an example taken from the Cats typelevel.org, Scala Cats documentation: // A type class to provide textual representation trait Show[A] { def show(f: A): String } // A polymorphic function that works only when there is an implicit // instance of Show[A] available def log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a)) // An instance for String implicit val stringShow = new Show[String] { def show(s: String) = s } // The parameter stringShow was inserted by the compiler. scala> log(\\"a string\\") a string Coq (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances.A Gentle Introduction to Type Classes and Relations in Coq Recent versions of Agda 2 also provide a similar feature, called \\"instance arguments\\".\\"Modelling Type Classes With Instance Arguments\\".  Other approaches to operator overloading  In Standard ML, the mechanism of \\"equality types\\" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class \`Eq\`, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler. The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types. SML's and OCaml's modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for ad hoc polymorphism. The object oriented subset of OCaml is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.  Related notions  An analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in GHC) is that of type family. In Clean typeclasses are similar to Haskell, but have a slightly different syntax. Rust supports traits, which are a limited form of type classes with coherence. Mercury has typeclasses, although they are not exactly the same as in Haskell. In Scala, type classes are a programming idiom which can be implemented with existing language features such as implicit parameters, not a separate language feature per se. Because of the way they are implemented in Scala, it is possible to explicitly specify which type class instance to use for a type at a particular place in the code, in case of ambiguity. However, this is not necessarily a benefit as ambiguous type class instances can be error-prone. The proof assistant Coq has also supported type classes in recent versions. Unlike in ordinary programming languages, in Coq, any laws of a type class (such as the monad laws) that are stated within the type class definition, must be mathematically proved of each type class instance before using them.

In 1631, Sir Ferdinando Gorges gave the island to Arthur Mackworth, his deputy in Casco Bay, and the island has retained his name. There is a causeway connecting the island to the mainland in Falmouth. Visitors to the island must pass a State park entrance tollhouse and pay an entrance fee; cars can enter the island but parking is limited. There is a footpath around the perimeter of the island with views of Falmouth, Portland, and other islands surrounding the bay. The island is heavily wooded. One portion of the woods is dedicated to “Fairy Houses” which are constructed by visitors using natural materials found on the island. https://www.fairyhouses.com/news/mackworth-island-permanent-fairy-houses- village/ Mackworth Island has a beautiful rocky shore and offers ample opportunities for surf fisherman of Bluefish and Stripers.Features  Why I hate Mackworth Island There is a nominal 3 dollar entrance fee per person.

It is a software product of Actian Corporation. OpenROAD is a fourth-generation programming language (4GL) which include a suite of development tools, with built-in Integrated development environment (IDE) (Written in OpenROAD), Code Repository, allowing applications to be developed and deployed on Microsoft and UNIX/LINUX platforms. History The history of OpenROAD is closely tied to that of the Ingres relational database. OpenROAD started in the early 1990s as a product called Windows 4GL. When Ingres was re-badged as OpenIngres, the new name of OpenROAD was born. Since that time it has been through a number of major developments. The Ingres Product set, (marketed by ASK Corporation, Computer Associates, Ingres Corporation and then Actian) was popular in the governments of North West Europe, and can be found in many government departments. OpenROAD née Windows4GL appeared in beta form on the SUN platform in 1991 as Windows4GL 1.0, and was available to British Universities under a special license agreement. The development environment was known as the Sapphire Editor. The Sapphire Editor allowed the creation of complex GUI interfaces using an IDE, rather than large volumes of Motif code / resource files. This was one of the first environments to enable rapid prototyping of GUI clients. Windows4GL 2.0 introduced Microsoft Windows compatibility and the debugger. OpenROAD 3.0 was when it became stable on MS Windows. OpenROAD 3.5(1) was when it became stable. OpenROAD 4.1 introduced an interface to ActiveX controls, providing access to ActiveX control attributes and methods within the language. This mechanism often requires 'Wrapper' DLLs to be written to handle data type issues, one of which being a 2000 character limit on strings of text. It is an interpreted language that uses a runtime distributable client to process 'image' files, thus no DLL or .NET dependency issues under MS Windows (ActiveX aside). It was possible to use images in any environment (Unix, VMS or MS Windows up to version 3.51), however portability issues between GUI environments (mostly related to FONT differences) made this difficult. There was a Macintosh Beta version produced. After 3.51, the UNIX environments used a Commercial PC emulator to give native capability, possibly one of the hurdles on the ROAD to its Open Source status across all platforms. Variations in the distribution include FAT client (Requires Ingres NET for communication), Thin eClient (can be used without Ingres NET but needs to use the Application Server instead (DCOM)), and finally mClient for Mobile Windows Clients (HTTP services required to interface to the Application server). OpenROAD 2006 (5.0+) went General Available December 2006. OpenROAD 5.1 went Generally Available Apr 2011. The defining feature of the release was general- purpose system classes for XML support, to allow creation and parsing of arbitrary XML documents without the need to create additional user classes or to use external components (3GL Procedures or External Class Libraries). Providing an XML based export file format will that will be documented, human readable, produce clean differences between different revisions of a file, allow changes to be merged, will allow OpenROAD source components to be managed by many different Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems. OpenROAD 2006 5.5 with UNICODE support was a special limited release. OpenROAD 6.0 is the current general release and includes the additional UNICODE support of 5.5 . Language structure The syntax of OpenROAD is very closely linked to that of the Ingres database, with direct support for embedded SQL. In a similar way to other event based programming languages, code can be placed in groups for related windows/system events. The syntax is similar to Microsoft Visual Basic, allowing OpenROAD users to quickly adapt to Visual Basic with the help of Intellisense. Intellisense is still not available (Q2 of 2008) in the OpenROAD IDE, however editors like TextPAD have syntax files that allow colour-coding of source files using key word recognition. OpenROAD comes with system classes with following functionality: * application source (allows to dynamically fetch, create, modify source artifacts) * database access * data types (scalar and complex) * runtime control * visual forms (incl. common widgets and controls) Features * object oriented language: class, simple inheritance (no interfaces, currently no constructor/destructor but planned for version 5.0) * Cross platform support * Integrated Debugger/IDE * Integrated Application Server * Support for Windows CE development (V5.0) * Support for VB.Net/Java Integration Features needed (Q2 2008)  * Intellisense for source, SQL statements and user defined objects. * The ability to construct user objects that inherit from the system classes * Better configuration management for large development teams * Native access to .NET classes * In process access to Ingres NET for FAT clients making distribution easier. * Extension of the OpenROAD language into the Ingres database engine replacing the Procedure language. * Access to the sources of the OpenROAD language Platforms OpenROAD application can be deployed on the following clients :- Thin Client (Web), Windows, and various flavours of Linux/Unix. It has support for n-tier systems by using the OpenROAD Application Server. The Application Server can be deployed on Windows or Linux/Unix platforms. It has built-in support for the Ingres database, or one of the following using a product called Enterprise Access: Oracle, SQL Server or DB2, which allows the client to use the same SQL syntax for all target databases.

About 250 trucks are made each year in the company's factory in Veenendaal in the Netherlands. The company also has a service center for their trucks in the small Dutch town Ederveen. History The company was founded in 1948 by Wuf and Adrie van Ginkel and started out as a truck dealer. Modifications to trucks left over from the US Army such as the GMC Diamond were also done and these trucks were then sold. In the early 1960s the company became a true truck manufacturer and changed name to Van Ginkels Automobiel Fabriek, or GINAF for short. The company started producing their own trucks using mainly DAF components. Because of this GINAF trucks often look similar to DAF trucks as the cabin used is usually the same as the ones used by DAF. Since 1986 GINAF uses a hydropneumatic suspension system for many of its trucks, which functions better under heavy loads and rough terrain compared to conventional suspension systems and also has a longer lifespan. GINAF was declared bankrupt in December 2011; it was then taken over by Chinese CHTC. Special trucks Special custom made trucks include firetrucks, riot control trucks, military trucks, garbage trucks and airport fuel bowsers. Several GINAF trucks also participate in the annual Dakar Rally as both rally and service trucks, having done so since 1987, though the first GINAF to participate in the rally was labelled as being a DAF for marketing purposes.

The parish includes the hamlet of Brighthampton. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,497. The River Windrush flows past the village and with its tributary Medley Brook it forms much of the eastern boundary of the parish. The western boundary has been subject to changes and disputes in past centuries. It now follows Brighthampton Cut, an artificial land drain dug in the 19th century. The Windrush joins the River Thames at Newbridge just over to the south. Archaeology Palaeolithic axes have been found west of Standlake village and northeast of Brighthampton. Neolithic implements have been found north of Standlake village. Late Bronze Age urn burials have been found in ring ditches north of Brighthampton on Standlake Downs. Evidence of an extensive Iron Age settlement with round huts and storage pits has been found near the Bronze Age site. Sites have been found north and northeast of Standlake village where there were Roman settlements from the middle of the 1st century AD until late in the 2nd century AD. There was also a Roman settlement west of Standlake village. A large pagan burial ground from the 5th and 6th centuries AD has been found south of Malthouse Farm in Brighthampton. Burials from the 7th century have been found in the Bronze Age burial ground on Standlake Downs. Brighthampton was first recorded in AD 984 in the Saxon era, when it was part of the Royal manor of Bampton. Manor 12th-century documents record the toponym as Stanlache about AD 1155 and Stanlac in a pipe roll of 1194. The name is derived from Old English, meaning \\"stony stream and hill\\". Standlake emerged as a separate settlement in the middle of the 12th century. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford was the feudal overlord of a manor of six hides at Brighthampton.Open Domesday Online: Brighthampton, accessed January 2017 However, this is believed to be the manor that later became known as Standlake. By 1242 Baldwin de Redvers, 3rd Earl of Devon was the overlord of Standlake. When his heir Richard de Redvers, 4th Earl of Devon died in 1193, Standlake passed to the Crown. In 1355-56 Edward III granted Standlake to his daughter Isabella de Coucy. After her death, Richard II granted Standlake to William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. Standlake belonged to John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster by 1388 and was recorded as part of the Duchy of Lancaster until early in the 16th century. In 1086 FitzOsbern's mesne lord was Anchetil de Greye, who also held Rotherfield Greys in South Oxfordshire. The mesne lordship remained with the de Greyes until 1192, when John de Greye died without a male heir and his holding Standlake passed to his daughter Eve. Eve's husband Ralph Murdac took part in a rebellion for which he was deprived of his landholdings in 1194, but after Ralph's death Richard I restored Standlake to Eve. When Eve died in 1242 the tenure of the manor was divided into quarters, which were not reunited until the 16th century. The main part of Standlake Manor House is a timber- framed house built in the 15th century. A chimney stack and a stone fireplace with heraldic decoration were inserted around 1600. The western bay of the mediaeval house was demolished at some time and only the central and eastern bays survive. A stone-built extension was added to the house in 1889. Churches =Church of England= The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles dates from the latter part of the 12th century. It was enlarged in the 13th and 14th centuries and underwent further alterations in about 1500. The Gothic Revival architect C.C. Rolfe restored the building between 1880 and 1891 and the spire was restored in 1911. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast the second and third bells in 1709 and the fifth bell in 1710. William Taylor of Loughborough cast the tenor bell in 1843, presumably at the foundry he had at the time in Oxford. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1887 and the fourth bell in 1931. St Giles' has also a Sanctus bell that Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester cast in 1781. The central range of St Giles' Rectory dates from at least 1246 and includes a lancet window from about 1300. The north range was added late in the 15th century, and a small south wing was added in 1661. Further alterations and additions were made in the 18th and 19th centuries, and dilapidated outbuildings including the parish's tithe barn were demolished. In 1980 the rectory was sold as a private house, and in restoration work in 1981 the new owners uncovered early 17th century wall paintings in an upstairs room over the hall. In the 15th century Standlake had a hermitage. After the English Reformation it became a cottage and was absorbed into Manor Farm. The building still existed in 1659 and may have been incorporated into later buildings, but if so it was demolished when the Manor House was extended in 1889. =Baptist= A few families of nonconformists were recorded in the parish in the latter part of the 17th century, and in the 18th century several local families were Anabaptists who attended a chapel in Cote. A Baptist chapel was built between Brighthampton and Standlake in 1832, flourished in the 1840s and 50s and a gallery was added to increase capacity in 1865. In the 20th century falling attendances led to services being discontinued in 1937, but they were resumed in 1951. The chapel finally closed in 1978 and in 1994 it was serving as the offices of a missionary society. It is now a private house. Former Primitive Methodist chapel =Methodist= A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1864–65 and became a Methodist chapel in 1932. Sunday services ceased in 1970 and the chapel is now a private house. Historic houses Gaunt House, a moated house east of Standlake village across the River Windrush, existed by the latter part of the 15th century. It is named after the family that owned it until 1516. In the English Civil War it belonged to Samuel Fell, Dean of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford and was garrisoned by Royalist troops until the Parliamentarian Colonel Thomas Rainsborough besieged and captured it in May 1645. Thereafter it was garrisoned by Parliamentarian troops, including cavalry who raided Kidlington in October 1645 and infantry who fought at Radcot in April 1646. After Samuel Fell's death in 1649 Gaunt House passed first to his widow Margaret and then to his son John Fell, who was Bishop of Oxford from 1676. On his death in 1686 John Fell left Gaunt House to Christ Church, Oxford to provide an income to pay bursaries for poor students. It remained with Christ Church until it was sold 1955. Gaunt House was originally timber-framed but only a section of the original structure remains: all the rest having been replaced in stone by the early part of the 17th century. Lincoln Cottage, near St. Giles' church, is a timber-framed cruck building dating from about 1500. Lincoln Farm house, formerly Tyrlings, is also a late mediaeval timber-framed building. It had a chimney stack inserted about 1564 and a stone-built second wing added before the end of the 16th century. At one time its tenant was Walter Bayley, who was physician to Elizabeth I and from 1561 until 1582 was Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Oxford. Cheswell Cottage was originally called Bodens. It is a timber framed thatched cottage dating from around 1550, with subsequent stone built 17th and 20th century additions. For parts of the 17th and 18th century it was owned by Lincoln College, Oxford. Economic history A thatched cottage in Standlake The Domesday Book in 1086 recorded one watermill on the de Grey estate. By the 13th century the parish had five mills on the River Windrush of which two were fulling mills involved with west Oxfordshire's trade in wool. Weaving was a cottage industry in the parish until the middle of the 18th century. Gaunt Mill, about southwest of Gaunt House, was the \\"new mill\\" in the early part of the 13th century. It was a double mill with one part for corn and the other for fulling. From the early part of the 17th century it was purely a corn or gristmill. Magdalen College, Oxford acquired interests in Gaunt Mill in 1483 and 1538 and bought the mill outright in 1617. By 1883 the mill was in poor repair and by 1928 it was in only occasional use. Magdalen College sold the mill in 1920 and it was converted to private use in the 1940s and 1950s. Church Mill, about upstream of St. Giles' church, existed by 1279. It may have always been a corn mill, and in the 18th and 19th centuries it had a bakery. By 1636 Magdalen College had a half share in Church Mill. The mill was disused by 1911 but was repaired in the 1920s and generated electricity until 1968. During the Second World War it again undertook some corn milling. The mill was restored again early in the 1980s and was still in working order in 2006. In 1230 Standlake was licensed to hold a three-day market annually on St. Giles day and the days immediately before and thereafter (31 August – 2 September). By 1279 the market had reduced to two days, and shortly thereafter it seems to have lapsed. By the latter part of the Middle Ages the main north-south route through the parish was that between Witney and Newbridge, which formed part of the main highway between London and Gloucestershire. Since the 1920s the Berinsfield - Abingdon - Witney stretch of this road has been classified as the A415. Aston Road, which links Brighthampton with Cote, was a bridleway until 1629, when it was made into a highway. It is now part of the B4449 road. The Black Horse public house By the early part of the 17th century Standlake had three or four public houses, including the Chequers, which traded until at least 1781. By the latter part of the 18th century Standlake had between seven and 11 pubs. The Black Horse is a 16th-century building that was a pub by 1761 and is now a gastropub.The Black Horse, Standlake By 1790 The Bell had opened in Rack End, but by 1804 it had moved to the High Street to a building part of which is timber-framed infilled with brick nogging, and the remainder of which is built of Cotswold stone. The Bell Inn was closed for refurbishment for some time after Greene King sold it in 2008, but reopened in August 2010 as a free house run by Few Inns. The Bell was damaged by a fire on 25 September 2015. It has not reopened and is now being redeveloped. An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until 1853, when its common lands were enclosed. Social history Standlake Church of England primary school A school in Standlake was mentioned in 1672 and bequests to fund the education of Standlake were made in 1711 and 1721. Classes were held in St. Giles' church until 1846, when a schoolroom and schoolmaster's house were built on land given by Magdalen College. The building was enlarged in 1866, 1874 and 1894. In 1939 the school was reorganised as a junior and infants' school and in 1947 it became a Voluntary controlled school. The school was enlarged again in 1969 and continues to serve the parishes of Standlake and Northmoor.Standlake CE Primary School Standlake had a lending library, established with the support of the Rector by 1877, and which continued intermittently until the 20th century. In 1924 it was superseded by a new library at the village school, which served the village until 1964 when it was succeeded by Oxfordshire County Council's mobile library service. In about 1921 a converted army hut was erected as Standlake's first village hall. It was replaced by the present community centre in 1989. In 1954 a second army hut was erected as a youth club. It was replaced by a purpose built club building in 1963. Longwood House on Abingdon Road was built in the 1920s. Barbara Dockar Drysdale founded the Mulberry Bush School for severely disturbed children at the house in 1948. Amenities Standlake has a Post Office and general store and a car repair garages and two camp sites. There are various small to medium sized businesses both within the village and on two light industrial parks in the parish.

It is located 4 miles (6.1 km) south of Dalbeattie, and 1 mile (1.7 km) south of Palnackie, in Buittle parish. It is remarkable as the only cylindrical tower house in Scotland. Orchardton Tower is in the care of Historic Scotland as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. History The Cairns family, who built Orchardton, were associated with the area from the early 15th century. Alexander Cairns was Provost of Lincluden Collegiate Church until his death in 1422. His brother, John Cairns, was Custumar, or customs officer, in Linlithgow. John Cairns was also a military engineer, and was responsible for designing the impressive King David's Tower at Edinburgh Castle, which was destroyed in 1573. His heir, another John Cairns who was his nephew's son, was granted the lands of 'Irisbuitle', or Orchardton, in 1456. The grant of former Douglas lands was possibly in return for Cairns' support for James II, in his successful struggle to overthrow the power of the 'Black' Earls of Douglas. John Cairns built Orchardton Tower soon after. Circular towers such as this were common during the thirteenth century, but had largely been replaced by square and rectangular tower houses by the 1400s: Orchardton Tower is thus unique in being built around 200 years after such towers had gone out of fashion. The fact that round towers are common in Ireland has led to speculation of Irish influence at Orchardton, however no specific link has been found. John Cairns' grandson William was present, in support of his relatives Agnew and Lochinvar, at the murder of Thomas McLellan of Bombie, outside St. Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh in 1527. On William's death in 1558 the estate was partitioned between his three daughters. One heiress, Margaret Cairns, Lady Orchardton, after marrying Edward Maxwell became involved in a feud between the Maxwells and the Johnstons, and in 1591 went to stay with her son Alexander Kirkpatrick. He tried to secure her income and imprisoned her in a chamber at Kirkmichael.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 621-2. The part of Orchardton including the castle was sold in 1616 to Robert Maxwell, who had earlier bought the other portions of the estate. Maxwell was a nephew of Lord Maxwell, and in 1663 was created a baronet. Maxwell's descendants were divided along with the rest of the country during the Reformation. Mungo Maxwell (b. 1700) was illegally disinherited by his half brothers on religious grounds. His son, another Robert Maxwell, was raised in France, and obtained a commission in the French Army. Following service in France, he took part in the Jacobite rising of 1745. He was wounded at Culloden and taken prisoner, where his commission was discovered and he was consequently spared execution; as a foreign soldier, he was treated as a prisoner of war rather than a traitor. Robert returned to France for a time, before deciding to declare himself a Protestant in order to claim his rightful inheritance. In 1753 he resigned his commission and returned to Scotland to begin a long lawsuit, which ended in 1771 when he was confirmed as Sir Robert Maxwell, 7th Bt. These events were used as inspiration by Sir Walter Scott, for his novel Guy Mannering. Robert Maxwell completed construction of a new, more comfortable residence at Orchardton Castle. He was bankrupted by his financial dealings, and in 1785 the estate was sold to the Douglas family. It is unlikely that the castle was lived in after this time. The tower The round tower was located at the north east corner of a fortified yard or barmkin, which would have sheltered livestock and provided cellars, a bakehouse, and probably a hall built on an upper level. The tower itself was reserved for living quarters, and was accessed via a stair, possibly moveable, from the barmkin up to a first floor doorway. The present entrance, on the north of the tower, was constructed in the 17th or 18th centuries. A new door was formed from an existing window and a permanent stone stair constructed. The tower is 11m, in height, and around 9m in diameter, tapering slightly to the top. A corbelled parapet forms the top of the walls, with a gabled caphouse covering the spiral stair, which is within the 1.8m thick wall. Inside, a vaulted cellar occupies the ground floor. Above this was a main room with fireplace, deep windows with seats, and a carved lavabo or piscina. Above this would have been two further rooms, although the wooden floors have collapsed.

Between Swindon and Oxford it is a primary route. Present route Since the opening of the M4 motorway, the road has been in two sections. The first section begins on Old Market Street near the centre of Bristol, and passes through Kingswood before leaving the city on the east side. From here it travels eastward over the southern part of the Cotswolds, to the north of Bath, to Chippenham in Wiltshire. The second section starts at a junction with the A419 east of Swindon. It then travels under the Great Western Main Line at the twin-arch Acorn Bridge and by-passes Shrivenham (the road originally went through Shrivenham, but the by-pass was built in the mid-1980s) and Watchfield, then on towards Faringdon in the Vale of White Horse. A further by-pass section, opened in 1979, avoids the centre of Faringdon, passing just south of Folly Hill and crossing the A417. The A420 then travels the corallian limestone ridge that forms the north-west boundary of the Vale of White Horse, passing Littleworth, Buckland and Longworth. A dual-carriageway section by- passes Southmoor and Kingston Bagpuize on its way to Oxford. Most of the road between Swindon and Oxford, apart from the dual carriageway sections and a short section around Faringdon, is limited to 50 mph (80 km/h). A further dual-carriageway section bypasses Cumnor Hill, to give a view of the \\"City of Dreaming Spires\\" that is Oxford from the west. It then passes the Oxford Ring Road, through the suburb of Botley and down the Botley Road. It crosses the River Thames on Osney Bridge and reaches central Oxford after passing under the Cherwell Valley Line next to Oxford station. Within Oxford, it is routed along Oxpens Road, then Thames Street, parts of St Aldate's then the High Street, which is closed to most motor traffic during the day.Email from Oxfordshire County Council Highways, 23 October 2007 The road then crosses Magdalen Bridge to St Clements and East Oxford and ascends the notoriously steep Headington Hill to the suburb of Headington before terminating at the Headington Roundabout (known locally as the Green Road roundabout), where it meets the A40 and the Oxford Ring Road (designated the A4142). Large vehicles such as lorries are advised by large signs at Oxford and Swindon not to take this route and use the alternative A34 and M4 route to Swindon. This is not enforced and the road is often heavily congested due to slow HGVs taking the shorter A420 route. The road has a poor accident record and this coupled with heavy peak time traffic has caused it to be nicknamed the 'A420 Road to Hell' in the local media. A survey in February 2018 claimed that it is the most dangerous A road in South East England.  History  What is now the A420 was established in the early 18th century as a direct route between Chippenham and Bristol via Tog Hill, avoiding the older and more established route via Bath (now the A4). It was an important road for Bristol, whose communications with Bath had been disputed and difficult. After the Bath Road was turnpiked in 1707, the Bristol Trust attempted to turnpike the direct road in 1727, but faced opposition from colliers at Kingswood, and the road was not sufficiently improved until the 1740s. When first classified in 1922, the A420 ran between Chippenham and Botley, near Oxford, while the road between Bristol and Chippenham was the A430.1922 road list The two roads were later joined and the A430 renumbered A420. The road from Botley through Oxford to Headington was originally part of the A40. When the northern Oxford bypass was built in the 1930s, the A40 was rerouted along the bypass and the road through Oxford was renumbered A420. As a result of the building of the M4 motorway in the early 1970s and subsequent road modernisation, the A420 between Chippenham and Swindon lost its identity. From Chippenham to Lyneham through Sutton Benger and to the north of RAF Lyneham and its limestone ridge, it became the B4069. From Lyneham to Swindon it became part of the A3102. From Swindon through Stratton St Margaret to the A419 it became the A4312. Matches between rival football clubs Oxford United and Swindon Town are sometimes referred to as the \\"A420 derby\\". Landmarks Sir Bevil Grenville's Monument in the Lansdown suburb of Bath is near the A420. Site of fastest speeding ticket The A420 near Kingston Bagpuize in Oxfordshire was the site of the fastest speeding offence ever caught in a routine speed check in the UK. On 27 January 2007 Timothy Brady, a 33-year-old man from Harrow, London, was clocked driving at in a Porsche 911 Turbo that he had taken without permission from his employer, a luxury car hire firm. Brady was disqualified from driving and sentenced to 10 weeks in prison.

He is a fictional horror host in the tradition of TV hosts on local television in both the United States and Canada. The Count Floyd character originated on the Canadian sketch show SCTV, but also later appeared on The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley (clips of which were used on Cartoon Planet), as well as Rush’s Grace Under Pressure tour.  The concept  As originally conceived, Count Floyd was the alter-ego of another SCTV character: Floyd Robertson, co-anchor of the SCTV News (The name was a joke based on that of Canadian news anchor Lloyd Robertson, but other than the name and occupation Floyd Robertson bears no real resemblance to his real-life counterpart). The premise was that employees at this very low-budget TV station had to double up on jobs, so news anchor Floyd Robertson was also the host of SCTV’s Monster Chiller Horror Theater, wearing a cheap Transylvanian vampire costume and speaking in a stereotypical Bela Lugosi type accent. Oddly, although Floyd was supposed to be a vampire, he would also open each show howling like a werewolf, presumably indicating that Floyd Robertson had only the vaguest of idea what a vampire was. Near the end of a howl, he would break off disarmingly into a weak chuckle. Although a parody of the typical horror movie hosts that were seen on local television stations during the 1950s to 1970s, the real-life hosts were nearly always already employed in other positions at the TV stations and their horror host personas were often so silly and “over the top” that Count Floyd was not really too far off the mark. The title Monster Chiller Horror Theater was taken from the Chiller Theater, a longtime local horror film show on WIIC (now WPXI) television in Pittsburgh, Joe Flaherty's hometown. While host Bill Cardille also known as \\"Chilly Billy\\" was nothing like Count Floyd (Cardille wore a coat and tie and spoke in his normal voice), the Dracula-esque persona adopted by Floyd may have been based on another Pittsburgh TV horror show host. The 1958-59 Friday night program \\"The Thirteenth Hour,\\" broadcast over KDKA-TV Channel 2 featured the vampire-like \\"Igor,\\" actually KDKA staff announcer George Eisenhauer whose costume bore no small resemblance to Count Floyd's. Much as Robertson's co- anchor, Earl Camembert, was partially inspired by American newsman Irv Weinstein (as well as by CBC news reader Earl Cameron, who anchored CBC TV's \\"The National\\" newscast from 1959 until 1965), Robertson too appears to have been at least partially inspired by Weinstein's weather anchor, Tom Jolls, who likewise doubled as the astronaut children's show host Commander Tom. Occasionally, Count Floyd would be joined by a vampire-caped sidekick known as The Pittsburgh Midget, played by Flaherty's brother Paul Flaherty, an obvious counterpart to diminutive Stefan, the Castle Prankster, played by Stephen Michael Luncinski on Chiller Theater.  Running gags  The main running gag of the sketch was that the station would usually provide truly awful films for the show that were not in the least bit scary, including such genres as biopics with very scant relation to horror (Madame Blitzman),SCTV, 10/17/77 - COUNT FLOYD'S \\"MADAME BLITZMAN\\" (YouTube). Retrieved on 2010-05-07. This was also the earliest acknowledgment of Floyd Robertson being Count Floyd. softcore pornography with a horror theme (Dr. Tongue's 3D House of Stewardesses) and Swedish independent (\\"Ingmar Burgman\\"'s Whispers of the Wolf which starred \\"Leave Ullman\\"), forcing Floyd to struggle to hype them to his mostly juvenile audience. (\\"Alright, it wasn't that scary but did you get a good look at those chicks?”). Occasionally, the films provided to Count Floyd would have absolutely no connection to horror at all -- on one memorable occasion, he was stuck trying to plug The Odd Couple, on another, Four for Texas. Other times, the expected film would not materialize, and Floyd would be forced to fill time. A particularly notable example of this was when the film Blood-Sucking Monkeys From West Mifflin, Pennsylvania failed to show up at the station in time for the show, so Count Floyd improvised the plot of the entire movie on his own. Count Floyd's frustration with the poor quality of the films on Monster Chiller Horror Theatre would sometimes cause him to break character and explain to the kids that he usually had little say in which movies he could show because the station's cheap manager would buy blocks of films in which one or two good movies were \\"packaged\\" with several clunkers. His frustration was also shown in an episode in which he mistakenly re-emerged from his coffin before the end of the show (thinking the camera was off) muttering, \\"Damn, who the hell schedules these things?\\" Count Floyd often tried to make a quick buck during the movie by selling gimmicky products (most often 3-D glasses) which would purportedly make the film seem more scary. Prices of these products would vary wildly, as though the figures were merely popping into his head as he promoted them by quoting \\"You gotta send...eighteen dollars...to me, Count Floyd...\\" Monster Chiller Horror Theatre did show a wide selection of cheesy 3D horror films, including 3D House of Beef, 3D House of Slave Chicks, and Tip O'Neill's 3D House of Representatives (\\"house\\" in many of these titles suggesting the classic 3D film House of Wax). Most of the films starred Dr. Tongue (portrayed by John Candy) and his Igor-like assistant Bruno (portrayed by Eugene Levy). The 3D effect of the films usually consisted merely of the actors getting extremely close to the camera (equipped with a fisheye lens to grossly exaggerate perspective) and simply lunging the object of 3D emphasis back and forth at the lens. These objects included such non-scary items as a pen, a cat, a telephone directory, a person's face, a snifter of brandy and a plate of pancakes, as seen in Dr. Tongue's Evil House of Pancakes. Related works During the Signals and Grace Under Pressure tours by Rush, a video played on the rear screen of Count Floyd introducing \\"The Weapon\\", “a scary song with real special effects” which could only be enjoyed if the listener was wearing 3D glasses. 3D glasses were actually given to the fans during the Toronto shows of the tours, most likely because these shows were filmed for the Grace Under Pressure tour video. An edited audio portion of the Count Floyd introduction was included on the single version of \\"The Weapon\\" that actually appeared on Rush’s Signals release of 1982. One audio recording, Count Floyd (RCA MFL1-8501), was released in 1982 featuring tracks such as \\"Reggae Christmas Eve in Transylvania\\" and \\"The Gory Story of Duane and Debbie\\". This was the only SCTV related audio recording apart from the Bob and Doug McKenzie discography. In 1987, Flaherty reprised his role as Count Floyd as an in- studio host for a free weekend preview of Cinemax (where SCTV had aired its final season in 1983-84). He would similarly reprise his role as Guy Caballero for a free preview weekend on Cinemax in 1988. In 1988, new Count Floyd skits were made for the Hanna-Barbera cartoon The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley, in which The Count Floyd Show was Ed Grimley’s favorite TV show that he never wanted to miss. In \\"Count Floyd's Scary Stories\\" (the only live- action segment of The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley), Count Floyd would be seen in a television studio set attempting to entertain children (portrayed by various children stars at the time). This appeared to be more of a nod to Bozo the Clown than horror hosts he is used to mocking, possibly an additional factor to the boredom of the children he is shown performing for.However, one famous horror host who doubled as a children's show host was John Zacherle, who in his \\"Zacherley\\" persona hosted The Mighty Hercules cartoons for WPIX (Channel 11) in New York City in 1963. In \\"Ed's Debut,\\" Count Floyd explained to a boy that howled because his grandmother is part-werewolf. Joe Flaherty also portrayed Count Floyd's mother Mama Floyd. The same Ed Grimley segments were later re-run on Cartoon Planet, with introductions by Space Ghost, Zorak or Brak. Count Floyd was also the pitchman for Canada's Wonderland when it launched \\"The Bat\\" roller coaster in 1987. In the Halloween episode of Flaherty's later show Freaks and Geeks he appears in a vampire costume and reprises the same voice in allusion, scaring away many young trick or treaters. In 1990, Count Floyd released a how-to videotape called Making Real Funny Home Videos, ostensibly aimed at viewers who wanted to make America's Funniest Home Videos-style videos. Count Floyd appeared in a \\"Smoke Detectives\\" short where he assists some kids on how to teach fire safety to people. Count Floyd also appeared in the original 1999 CBC Television film Must Be Santa. In 2014, Count Floyd stars in The Wet Secrets music video \\"Nightlife\\" which pits the old school media vampire against today's glittery, new vampires in \\"Tweelight.\\" This music video shows the mundane life of a vampire but allows the character to eventually take his revenge against modern, hipster vampires.

The military began using the area shortly after 1860 when the British acquired Kowloon. The barracks are bounded by Austin Road, Jordan Path, Gascoigne Road and Chatham Road South. The barracks are currently occupied by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) who began using the facility after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong on 1July 1997. The compound now includes a hospital constructed for the People's Liberation Army, Hong Kong, completed around 1997. General information A long-standing part of Hong Kong's military history, the Gun Club Hill Barracks arose out of the need to house soldiers on the Kowloon Peninsula following the cession of the area under the 1863 Treaty of Tientsin following the Second Opium War. The British were in need of additional military facilities and had begun scouting sites on the Kowloon Peninsula. The purpose was not only to house garrisons but also provide military defences on both sides of the harbour. With the shoreline being used for civilian activities, sites in the King's Park area were selected to establish encampments. The area, dotted with gardens, streams and paddy fields was a popular place to hunt birds and, once the military encampments were established, several firing ranges were set up for training. Despite the lack of verification, Sinologist R.G. Horsnell believes it is plausible that is how this area got its name. The barracks compound is about , although the original Gun Club Hill Barracks encompassed a much larger area. The military organised a series of tented encampments situated on where now stands Kowloon Park, Gun Club Hill and King's Park. They were connected to civilian areas by horse trails in the Chatham Road area. Through the years the area has been whittled down to ‘Gun Club Hill’ a smaller portion of the King’s Park area between Jordan and Austin Road. 1860-1889 During this period, there were no permanent structures so troops were rotated in from the Murray and Victoria Barracks. Tents and matsheds were used for accommodations and soldiers carried out shooting practice with rifles and larger weapons (Harfield, 1990) The first garrison to be stationed there were the \\"Gun Lascars\\", a group of Muslim artillery gunners originating from India. The following is a list of some of the regiments stationed at the encampments during that time: 1863 Second Battalion 20th Foot (arrived in December) 1888 91st Argylls (arrived in December) stayed in matsheds during quarantine period 1892 Argylls replaced by the 1st Battalion, The King’s Shropshire Light Infantry and quarantined in Kowloon matsheds because of smallpox outbreak on the troop ship from Alexandria 1899 Several companies of Royal Welch Fusiliers quartered 1900-1950 Chatham Road, Austin Road, Jordan Road, Jordan Path and Gascoigne Road gradually ringed the grounds of Kowloon Cricket Club, and Gascoigne Road was named after Maj. Gen. Sir W.J. Gascoigne KCMG, Commander British Troops in China and Hong Kong from 18981903. During 190304, the first permanent buildings were built for infantry, but very soon occupied by the Asiatic Artillery made up of Sikh and Punjabi Mussulman Companies called Gun Lascars. Four companies of soldiers were billeted in a new barrack blocks flanking the parade ground completed in 1905. According to the Public Record Office, the construction was of “brick and granite and best Manilla Hardwood; outlet walls of Amoy Brick and inner walls of Canton Brick\\" (Harfield, 1990, p. 357). In 1909, other buildings were constructed and the barracks’ layout shown as an Infants School, Followers Hut, Sikh/Muslim Cook-house, NCOs Quarters, Guard House, Sergeants Mess, Officers Mess, and a small Medical Centre. Gun Club barracks saw the organisation of its first battalion in 1910 consisting of about 446 soldiers including eight staff sergeants, 43 mounted troops, 312 soldiers from the artillery companies, 60 from engineer companies and 23 band members. The Officers’ Mess underwent a facelift with an annex added to the south elevation facing the Chatham Road entrance. A new remodelled entrance wing was added by 1930, which still stands. Key dates: (p. 277) : 1904 Barracks Blocks, Officers' Mess, Guard House, Soldiers' Canteen etc. in existence 1905 Col. Lewis, RE (Rt.) visited Gun Club Barracks, which then housed the Asiatic Artillery. King's Park was described as \\"very rough\\" and presumably still being used for army training.

In addition to the British infantry battalions which were regularly stationed there, other organizations shared the compound. The United Services Recreation Club and the Intelligence and Security Company, which occupied the old Colony Club building were among them. The following is a chronological list of some of British military personnel stationed at the barracks during this time. 1956-1957 15 Medium Regiment Royal Artillery. 1965-1967 The First Battalion Queen\`s Own Buffs 1967 The First Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers, 1969 The First Battalion The Royal Welch Fusiliers 1971 The First Battalion The Black Watch 1974 The First Battalion The Royal Hampshire Regiment 1976-1977 The First Battalion The Light Infantry Note: The barracks were not used exclusively by infantry battalions, the 34th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment was stationed at Gun Club from 1961 until 1963. In 1977, part of the Alanbrooke Block (British military quarters) and Infants’ School (Block 27) were demolished to make way for the construction of the New Gurkha MQs, Temple, Clinic and School started in the same year while the ten Intelligence and Security Company moved from Argyle Street Camp to colony Block (Block 36). Furthermore, Gurkha Transport Regiment and Gurkha Signal moved from Sham Shui Po Barracks to Gun Club and Victoria Junior School moved from Victoria barracks as well in 1978. During excavations, a skeleton said to date from Japanese occupation was unearthed in 1986. In the same year, various new classrooms were built at Gun Club Primary School. Three years after this, there were two severe floods, one on 2 May and another on 20 May during Typhoon Brenda, which caused significant damage to equipment, buildings and vehicles of the MT compound. The 1990s brought some new additions to the compound. A new military hospital was built facing Jordan Road after demolishing Colony Club (Block 36), St. Eligius’ Church and also the old gum shed. Some of the banyan trees were transplanted into other areas of the barracks and some were moved to the new Kowloon Walled City Park. Another remarkable event happened in 1995, the hand over of the barracks vacated by the British regiment, the Gurkha’s, to Hong Kong Government. Lastly, in 1997, a new stage was begun with the handover of Hong Kong’s sovereignty to China and Peoples Liberation Army became the new tenants for these historic facilities. 1997 onwards Currently the barracks are being used by the Peoples Liberation Army who began using the barracks in 1997. It includes a hospital, housing blocks, a primary school, grocery stores and many other amenities. Gun Club Hill Barracks Military Hospital Front facade of the hospital Hospital map panel In 1994, construction began on a new hospital, and its construction was completed in 1997. Gun Club Hill Barracks Military Hospital provides medical services for all PLA personnel stationed in Hong Kong.Architectural Services Department, 1997 It is located in the Gun Club Hill Barracks compound, bordered by Gascoigne Road, Jordan Road and Jordan Path. This multifunctional facility with nearly of working space, includes six buildings: a hospital, a multi-purpose building, a restaurant, two staff quarter blocks and a single-storey changing block (Architectural Services Department, 1997). The Hospital Building is the principal building of the complex and features a crescent-shaped Low Block and an L-shaped 11-storey High Block. It includes such medical facilities as general surgical wards, out-patient rooms and an X-ray laboratory. The Composite Building is a seven storey rectangular block next to the primary structure which provides support for the whole complex and many of the mechanical and electrical facilities are stored there.

It was and is considered by many, including handgun enthusiast and expert Elmer Keith, to be the finest revolver ever made.Keith, Elmer: Sixguns (1996 revision). R & R Books. Its popular name refers to its extra (third) locking lug on the cylinder crane. This extra locking mechanism was deemed necessary due to the increased power of the .44 Special cartridge (a lengthened .44 Russian and the parent of the .44 Magnum), first chambered in the Triple Lock.Jinks, Roy: History of Smith & Wesson. 1977. North Hollywood, CA: Beinfeld Publishing Company. History The .44 is part of the model name, regardless of the specific calibre of chambering of any individual revolver, and Hand Ejector differentiated the new design from Smith & Wesson's earlier top break revolvers. These 19th-century designs had an automatic ejector mechanism actuated when the frame was tipped up. The newer Hand Ejector models required the user to depress a plunger to eject spent cartridge casings. The New Century designation was in recognition of its status as Smith & Wesson's first 20th century design. It was only manufactured between 1908 and 1915, for a total of 15,376 revolvers, a stock that sold out completely by 1917. It was replaced by a .44 Hand Ejector 2nd Model, most visibly different in lacking the ejector shroud and third locking lug. Smith & Wesson changed the design for two primary reasons: customer demand and cost. The British and Canadian militaries pressed for the removal of the third locking lug due to concerns that the precision mechanism would collect dirt and cause the gun to malfunction. Additionally, this change and the removal of the ejector shroud simplified manufacturing, allowing Smith & Wesson to drop the price of the gun by two dollars: Whereas the Hand Ejector 1st Model was $21, the 2nd Model was $19. The ejector shroud was reintroduced in 1926 for the Hand Ejector 3rd Model, but the Triple Lock feature was never used again. British and Commonwealth World War I service To cover manufacturing shortages of the Webley Mk VI, early in the war the Ministry of Munitions contracted Colt and Smith & Wesson to manufacture revolvers chambered in .455 Webley. Smith & Wesson were given an initial contract to manufacture 5,000 triple lock pistols, known as the Pistol Smith & Wesson .455 with inch barrel Mark I, it was introduced into British service as a \\"substitute standard\\" sidearm on 5 July 1915 alongside the Colt New Service. Subsequent orders, lacking the third locking lug and ejector shroud, totalled 69,755 and were known as the Mark II.David Thomas, The Pistol in British Military Service during the Great War, University of Birmingham, 2010.

Born in San Diego, she was the daughter of Dr. Clifford Loos, co-founder of the Ross-Loos Medical Clinic and the Ross-Loos Medical Group, the first health maintenance organization (HMO) in the United States. She was the niece of screenwriter Anita Loos. Mary Loos died in Monterey, California, aged 94, due to complications following a stroke.  Career  After graduating from Stanford, Loos worked in the publicity department of Fox Films. In the mid-1930s she turned to acting, and had roles in several Fox pictures. She began her career as a publicist in New York before moving out to the West Coast and working as a screenwriter in 1941. She and her first husband, Richard Sale, wrote about 20 successful screenplays together before divorcing. After working with her husband, Loos continued in the written field. She became a story editor for Mike Frankovich Productions. She was both co-creator and one of the writers for Yancy Derringer (1958-1959), an American Western TV series. Bantam Books also published some of her novels. In her lifetime she wrote four total: \\"The Beggars Are Coming,\\" \\"Belinda,\\" \\"Barstow Legend\\" and \\"Pride of Lovers.\\"  Second marriage  Later in life, she married Carl von Saltza, whom she had met decades earlier while attending Stanford University and had previously been engaged to. However, the engagement fell apart due to the economic stance of the country at the time. The couple lost contact after school when Mary's career in public relations became successful and Carl joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. After Carl was fighting in World War II, Mary left New York to go to Hollywood, where she met her first husband, Richard Sale. In an interview, Loos claimed the marriage “was a great writing team but never a great marriage.” The marriage ended up failing and Loos left with her son Edward to Santa Monica. She continued writing creatively as a divorced mother for 20 years until May 4, 1989, when she was visiting a friend and saw the name of the man she once loved on a mailbox. She found out it was actually the Carl von Saltza from her past and they agreed to meet in Monterey. When they met again, it was instant attraction.

History The event is name in honor of Gallant Bloom who won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly champion of 1968, the 1969 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly and the 1969 American Champion Older Female Horse. In The Blood-Horse ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Gallant Bloom is ranked #79. The event was inaugurated on 30 August 1992 at Saratoga Race Course as a three year old fillies race over six furlongs. and was won by the Canadian bred filly Apelia who defeated the Grade I Frizette Stakes winner Preach by lengths. Later, in 2014 Apelia would be honored into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The following year the event was not held but was resumed in 1994 at Belmont Park with handicap conditions for three year old and older fillies and mares to enter. In 1995 the distance of the event was increased to furlongs. In 1997 the event was classified as Grade III and was upgraded to Grade II in 2001. The quality of the entrants for the event has justified its high status. The 2007 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner Indian Blessing won this event twice and is the only dual winner to date. In 2008 Indian Blessing went onto be crowned American Champion Female Sprint Horse.

Kvaløya is a mountainous island, with at least ten mountains higher than , and three reaching an elevation of more than ; of which the highest is Store Blåmann (big blueman at , can be climbed without climbing equipment, last part is steep). There are also several small fjords, almost dividing the island in two or three parts: Kaldfjorden, Ersfjorden, and Kattfjorden. The Rystraumen is a tidal current in the Straumsfjorden strait separating Kvaløya from the mainland to the south. Near this current, on the Kvaløya side, is Straumhella ( from the city), a popular recreation area with good fishing opportunities. Ryøya is an island in the midst of Rystraumen, formerly home to a small population of musk oxen that lived in the pine forest. The last musk ox, known as Alma, was discovered dead in 2013; an autopsy revealed that she had plastic in her stomach.

Biography Born on 18 November 1910, Bruce Fraser was educated at Bedford School and at Trinity College, Cambridge.http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U172538/FRASER_Sir_Bruce_Donald?index=260&results;=QuicksearchResults&query;=0 He served in the Scottish Office (1933), HM Treasury (1936–1960), the Ministry of Aviation (1960), the Ministry of Health (1960–1964), the Department of Education and Science (1964–1965), the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources (1965–1966). He finished his civil service career as Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of the Exchequer and Audit Department (now the National Audit Office) from 1966–1971. In the period from 1966–1968, Fraser served as External Auditor of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which was formerly known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO).International Maritime Organization (IMO). (1968). Resolutions and other decision of the 3rd Extraordinary Assembly and the 5th Assembly, p. 118. He is probably best known now for revising Sir Ernest Gowers’ classic book The Complete Plain Words, written to teach officials and others how to write clearly.Gowers, Ernest et al. (2002). Plain Words, pp. xii-xiii. By the early 1970s the language had moved on from the post-war era when Gowers had written the first edition. The publisher, HMSO, felt the need to publish an updated version, despite some resistance to tampering with a classic. Fraser was widely judged to have succeeded. His style is more robust than the elegant Gowers, though he is just as masterly in his use of the language. Stylistically they have been compared to George Lyttelton (Gowers) and Rupert Hart-Davis (Fraser) of the Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters. Both editions can be read for pleasure as well as instruction. Fraser enlivens the text with such howlers as: :*I have discussed the question of stocking the proposed poultry plant with my colleagues. :*Bulletin No. 160 on Housing of Pigs from Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. :*Authority is given for you to proceed and gas, preferably yourself :*It was here that the Emperor liked to put on his grand alfresco spectacles. :*Nothing is less likely to appeal to a young woman than the opinions of old men on the pill. :*People in the South East keep their teeth longer than people in the North. :*Prices of different models vary and you should take the advice of an expert on the make. :*Ladies who have kindly undertaken to act as school crossing wardens are reminded again that if they attempt to carry out their duties without their clothing on motorists are unlikely to take notice of them. Fraser adds, ‘Let us not be too censorious about passages like these. They are careless, of course, but they add to the gaiety of life. Let him who is quite sure he has never committed one cast the first stone.’ (Note how in 1973 an official style guide did not feel the need to use gender-neutral language. By the time of the next edition (see next paragraph) there were many pages devoted to that subject. 'Tempora mutantur', Fraser might have remarked, had he not been averse to gratuitous insertion of Latin tags into plain English prose.) In its turn the Fraser edition of Plain Words grew out of date and was superseded in 1986 by a complete revision by two academics, which remains instructive but is perhaps less likely to be read for pleasure.

Originally designed as a residential building, it currently houses the Johnson Graduate School of Management. Conception An early conceptual sketch Although women had previously enrolled in Cornell as early as 1870, the absence of a women's dormitory was problematic in attracting and retaining female students. Sage Hall was built in 1875, financed by Ithaca businessman Henry W. Sage, to fill this need. \\"When you are ready to carry out the idea of educating young women as thoroughly as young men,\\" Sage told his friend Ezra Cornell in 1868, \\"I will provide the endowment to enable you to do so.\\" Sage and Andrew Dickson White toured Oberlin College to study facilities being used there to successfully undertake coeducation. With Sage's $250,000 donation, construction started in 1872 under the guidance of professor of architecture Charles Babcock. In 1875, Sage College welcomed 25 female students, making the university a pioneer in coeducation and attracting many applications. Early graduates included two college presidents, Julia Josephine Thomas Irvine (Wellesley) and Martha Carey Thomas (Bryn Mawr); a prominent women's suffragist, Harriet May Mills; a publisher and author, Ruth Putnam; and the noted Cornell professor and scientist, Anna Botsford Comstock. Sage Hall was not equally accessible to all female students, however. In 1929, two Black female students, Pauline Davis and Ruth Peyton, were denied residency at Sage by the Dean of Women, R. Louise Fitch. The decision was upheld by Cornell President Livingston Farrand, who wrote in a letter to Ruth Peyton's mother that \\"... unfortunate as it may be, the placing of a colored student in one of the dormitories inevitably causes more embarrassment than satisfaction for such a student.\\" His predecessor, Jacob Gould Schurman, did involve himself in a similar controversy in 1911, when he had ruled in favor of admitting two Black female students to Sage College after 269 of their white peers had petitioned against it, declaring, “University doors must be open to all students irrespective of race or color or creed ...” By the time the decision was made, however, the two students had already left Cornell. Facilities When the building opened, it offered some of the most luxurious accommodations of any college dormitory in the United States. Residents had access to a swimming pool, gym, botanical conservatory, indoor plumbing, and elegant furnishings. The building contained features that defined it as a residential college (as opposed to a traditional dormitory) such as a dining hall, classrooms, a library, and professorial offices. It could house up to 120 students. A student drawing roomIn the 1930s, Sage became a graduate student dormitory. As most University-run student housing was consolidated into the West and North Campus areas, Sage became something of an anomaly: it was the only student living facility in the central campus area, and the only building that combined living and classroom space. It also housed the Cornell Career Center in its eastern wing. While Sage rooms were spacious compared to other dorms, by the 1990s the facility was significantly run down, as the University, which planned to transform the entire building into classroom space, did little more than basic maintenance. The 1994–1995 school year was the last in which Sage housed students. Later years Sage Hall with truncated spire, in 1987. The spire was restored in the late 1990s. Between April 1996 and August 1998, the university undertook a renovation, at the cost of $38 million, to convert the building into the new home for the Johnson Graduate School of Management. The top segment of the building's iconic spire that had been removed years before was rebuilt. A glass ceiling was constructed over the inner courtyard, changing it into an atrium, using a design inspired by the main exhibition hall at the Oxford University Museum. Babcock's original design of Sage Hall had been influenced by that same museum's design. Cornerstone letter regarding nonsectarianism A side view of Sage Hall Ezra Cornell was a birthright Quaker. He was later disowned by the Society of Friends for marrying outside of the faith to a Methodist by the name of Mary Ann Wood. Ezra and Mary Ann were married March 19, 1831, in Dryden, New York. On February 24, 1832, a disheartened Ezra Cornell wrote the following response to his expulsion from The Society of Friends due to his marriage to Mary Ann Wood: > \\"I have always considered that choosing a companion for life was a very > important affair and that my happiness or misery in this life depended on > the choice ...\\" He remarked that the nation was founded on the principle of separation of Church and State. Cornell felt the same way about the university; religious conservatives described the university in its early years as \\"Godless Cornell.\\" In 1873, when the cornerstone of Sage Hall was laid, Ezra Cornell wrote a letter for posterity—dated May 15, 1873—and sealed it into the cornerstone. No copies of the letter were made, and Cornell kept its contents a secret. However, he hinted at the theme of the letter during his speech at the dedication of Sage Hall, stating that \\"the letter deposited in the cornerstone addressed to the future man and woman, of which I have kept no copy, will relate to future generations the cause of the failure of this experiment, if it ever does fail, as I trust in God it never will.\\" Cornell historians largely assumed that the \\"experiment\\" to which Cornell referred was that of coeducation, given that Sage Hall was to be a women's dormitory and that coeducation was still a controversial issue. However, when the letter was finally unearthed in 1997, its focus was revealed to be the university's nonsectarian status—a principle that had invited controversy in the 19th century, given that most universities of the time had religious affiliations. Cornell wrote: > On the occasion of laying the corner stone of the Sage College for women of > Cornell University, I desire to say that the principle danger, and I say > almost the only danger I see in the future to be encountered by the friends > of education, and by all lovers of true liberty is that which may arise from > sectarian strife. From these halls, sectarianism must be forever excluded, > _all_ students must be left free to worship God, as their concience shall > dictate, and _all_ _persons_ of any creed or all creeds must find free and > easy access, and a hearty and equal welcome, to the educational facilities > possessed by the Cornell University. Coeducation of the sexes and entire > freedom from sectarian or political preferences is the only proper and safe > way for providing an education that shall meet the wants of the future and > carry out the founders idea of an Institution where \\"any person can find > instruction in any study.\\" I herewith commit this great trust to your care.

He was the first Canadian indigenous player in the National Hockey League, and the first First Nations player with treaty status. Early life Sasakamoose is of Cree descent. He grew up on the Ahtahkakoop Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan and learned to play ice hockey at an Indian residential school in Duck Lake, Saskatchewan. He was one of 11 children, where only five survived throughout childhood due to smallpox. Hockey career Sasakamoose's skills were first recognized by a priest in Montreal who became the sports director at the Indian residential school Saskamoose was attending. The priest pushed Sasakamoose to improve himself, and he went on to develop an extraordinary left-handed shot as a result. However, the discipline was characteristic of the harsh nature of residential schooling as witnessed by Sasakamoose himself in the Survivors Speak Report of the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission: > He said that the priests who ran the school were from Québec and loved > hockey. During the winters, the boys had the opportunity to skate every day. > But the school staﬀ employed the same sort of discipline in sports as they > did in every other aspect of school life. According to Sasakamoose, \\"The > priests never talked twice. The second time, you got the strap. But Father > Roussell had a dream. He told me, 'Freddie, I'm going to work you hard, but > if you work hard, you're going to be successful.' In 1953, Sasakamoose was selected as the most valuable player in the junior Western Canada Junior Hockey League while playing for the Moose Jaw Canucks, scoring 31 goals in 34 games in the 1953-54 season. He then made his debut in the NHL for the Chicago Black Hawks at Maple Leaf Gardens the night of February 27, 1954. At time, there were only six NHL teams and Sasakamoose was one of only 125 players. He played with the Blackhawks for 11 games during the rest of the 1953–1954 season, and in following years played in the minor leagues. Post-hockey life After retiring from ice hockey, Sasakamoose became a band councillor on his home reserve and later chief for six years. He has also been extensively involved in the development of sports programs for indigenous children. Since 1961 and beyond, he used his fame to promote opportunities for youth in sports which included ice hockey, long-distance running, track and field, soccer, and basketball. In 2002, he was honoured by the Blackhawks at a home game. He was inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame in the builders category in 2007. He has also been inducted into the Prince Albert Sports Hall of Fame, Meadow Lake Wall of Fame, FSIN Circle of Honour and the Canadian Native Hockey Hall of Fame. He has been acknowledged for achievements and contributions by both the Assembly of First Nations and the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN). He was also a founding member of the Northern Indian Hockey League. He became a member of the Order of Canada in 2018.

Coupons are normally described in terms of the coupon rate, which is calculated by adding the sum of coupons paid per year and dividing it by the bond's face value. For example, if a bond has a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 5%, then it pays total coupons of $50 per year. Typically, this will consist of two semi- annual payments of $25 each. 1945 2.5% $500 Treasury Bond coupon History: bearer bonds The origin of the term \\"coupon\\" is that bonds were historically issued in the form of bearer certificates. Physical possession of the certificate was proof of ownership. Several coupons, one for each scheduled interest payment, were printed on the certificate. At the date the coupon was due, the owner would detach the coupon and present it for payment (an act called \\"clipping the coupon\\"). The certificate often also contained a document called a talon, which (when the original block of coupons had been used up) could be detached and presented in exchange for a block of further coupons. Zero-coupon bonds and valuation Not all bonds have coupons. Zero-coupon bonds are those that pay no coupons and thus have a coupon rate of 0%. Such bonds make only one payment: the payment of the face value on the maturity date. Normally, to compensate the bondholder for the time value of money, the price of a zero-coupon bond will always be less than its face value on any date before the maturity date. During the European sovereign-debt crisis, some zero-coupon sovereign bonds traded above their face value as investors were willing to pay a premium for the perceived safe-haven status these investments hold. The difference between the price and the face value provides the bondholder with the positive return that makes purchasing the bond worthwhile. Between a bond's issue date and its maturity date (also called its redemption date), the bond's price is determined by taking into account several factors, including: * The face value; * The maturity date; * The coupon rate and frequency of coupon payments; * The creditworthiness of the issuer; and * The yield on comparable investment options.

It is operated under the Government of Saskatchewan's Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport. It is located at the southern terminus of Highway 60 on the shore of Pike Lake, an oxbow created by the South Saskatchewan River. The park's 1.5-km nature trail begins at the interpretive centre and provides a great opportunity to experience the diverse wildlife and ecosystems contained within the park. Pool is open early June to Labour Day. The Pike Lake area is part of the aspen parkland biome.65 Foot View Pike Lake Looking North Pike Lake Provincial Park The park includes a waterpark, beach, nature trail system, golf course, miniature golf course, cabins, and a large campground area, all located on the west shore of the lake, and is a popular destination for school trips and weekend campers due to its proximity to Saskatoon. Several small residential subdivisions are located within the park on the west. A large portion of the park located on the east side of Pike Lake is undeveloped except for a line of homes in the northeast corner. The only retail commercial operation within the park is The Huddle, a snack bar/convenience store in the main tourist area of the park; two additional convenience stores are located north of the park off Highway 60; otherwise, most other services come from either Saskatoon or from towns to the west such as Delisle and Vanscoy. This park, one of the smallest provincial parks in Saskatchewan, has been in operation since at least the 1960s. It is close enough to Saskatoon that from its highest point - the golf course in its northwest corner - the city's Viterra (formerly AgPro) grain terminal is visible. The province requires payment to enter the main western section of the park, so general access is restricted to Highway 60, though a couple of gates on the north and south ends of the park may be opened to adjacent grid roads if needed. An unincorporated rural residential community immediately adjacent to the northern park gates is also known by the name Pike Lake. The community includes a school and a recreation centre.

Overview Interior of the theater The theatre evolved out of the first city theatre built in 1836 housed in the present-day Old City Hall. The theatre was first established as the Croatian National Theatre in 1860, and in 1861 it gained government support putting it on par with many other European national theatres. In 1870 an opera company was added to the theatre and in 1895 it moved to the new purpose-built building on Republic of Croatia Square in Zagreb's Lower Town, where it is based today. Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph I was at the unveiling of this new building during his visit to the city in 1895. The building itself was the project of famed Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Herman Helmer, whose firm had built several theatres in Vienna. Celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the building were held on October 14, 1995. At the entrance of the theatre is located the wall fountain The Source of Life (Zdenac života), designed by Croatian artist and sculptor Ivan Meštrović in 1905. Many of Croatia's leading artist have worked at the theatre. Its first manager and dramatist was the Greek–Croatian poet Dimitrija Demeter, a leading activist of the Croatian national revival movement, with Ivan Zajc as first conductor. Jakov Gotovac was the Theatre's opera conductor from 1923 to 1958. The famous Croatian theatre director Branko Gavella began his career here, as did the first Croatian prima ballerina Mia Čorak Slavenska. The theatre has also seen many international artists including Franz Liszt, Sarah Bernhardt, Franz Lehár, Richard Strauss, Gérard Philipe, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Jean-Louis Barrault, Peter Brook, Mario Del Monaco, José Carreras. There are also Croatian National Theatres in Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Varaždin and Zadar. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic the Croatian National Theater in Zagreb decided, in collaboration with the daily newspaper 24sata, to allow citizens access quality cultural content through a YouTube channel, which will feature daily performances from the branches of opera, ballet and drama, and the viewers will be able to watch some of the most popular performances of the Theater, such as: * One Song a Day Takes Mischief Away - * Swan lake - * Ero the Joker - See also *History of Zagreb *History of Croatia *Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts References External links * Category:Theatres in Zagreb Category:Donji grad, Zagreb Category:National theatres Category:Opera houses in Croatia Category:1860 establishments in Croatia Category:Music venues completed in 1895 Category:Theatres completed in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in Croatia Category:Fellner & Helmer buildings Category:Neoclassical architecture in Croatia ","title":"Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb"},{"id":"3647511","text":"Fukuoka Tower at night is a tall tower located in the Momochihama area of Fukuoka, Japan. It is the tallest seaside tower in Japan. The highest observation deck at 123m has a 360degree view of the surrounding area, the most popular time to visit is at sunset. Fukuoka Tower was finished in 1989, taking a total of 14 months to build at a cost of ¥6,000,000,000 (roughly US$50,000,000 in 2015 terms). It was designed by Nikken Sekkei. It was built on reclaimed land out of Hakata Bay. Architecture Fukuoka Tower has a triangular cross-section which is covered with 8000 half-mirrors, giving it the appearance of a skyscraper. Because of this, it has been given the nickname \\"Mirror Sail\\". The half-mirrors reflect the sky when viewed from outside the structure but allow visitors to see outside while riding elevators to the top. The space between the base and the observation decks is hollow and thus unoccupied. There are three observation decks: one at 116 metres, a café/lounge deck at 120 metres, and the highest at 123 metres above the ground. Above this level rises a 111-metre television mast. The underground weight of Fukuoka Tower is 25,000 tons. Its weight above ground, by contrast, is only 3,500 tons. The tower is designed to withstand magnitude 7 earthquakes and wind speeds up to 65 m/s (). The strongest recorded earthquake in the area has been magnitude 6 and the strongest winds 49 m/s (). The tower is located at 2-3-26 Momochihama, Sawara-ku, Fukuoka. Culture The tower appears in the Japanese film Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla (1994). In a battle between the titular monsters, Godzilla destroys the tower.

It is named after Barão Geraldo de Rezende, a baron of the Empire of Brazil who owned a large farm in the region, in the 19th century. Barão Geraldo is approximately from downtown Campinas and it is mainly connected to it via the Rodovia Campinas-Paulínia highway. Barão Geraldo is famous for hosting the main campus of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). The university campus is surrounded by typical suburban communities, the Cidade Universitária Campineira, so named because many professors and a large number of students reside there; as well as by gated condominiums, such as Rio das Pedras, Barao do Cafe and Santa Eudoxia, and many old farms, such as Pau D'Alho, Santa Eudóxia, Rio das Pedras and Santa Genebra. The University itself and the surrounding residential communities were built on a former coffee and sugarcane plantation. Barão Geraldo is one of the greenest districts of Campinas. It has several lakes and the Mata of Santa Genebra, a large preservation area where the original rain forest which covered the region in the past can be seen and is studied by the University. It still has a large diversity of plants and animals, including the capybara and the spotted jaguars. Near UNICAMP, the district hosts also a large high- tech industrial zone (with several companies, such as Nortel); three research and development institutions; the Centro de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento em Telecomunicações (CPqD), in telecommunications and information technology; and the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron and the Instituto Eldorado. It is considered the main part of the so-called Brazilian Silicon Valley. The expansion of its technological park has attracted other institutions, which are planned to settle in Barão Geraldo in the near future, such as the Technological Center of the Brazilian Army, the Research and Development Center of Natura cosmetics company and others. Barão Geraldo is also a major health care destination in the state, with the large University Clinics Hospital, the Centro Médico de Campinas, the Centro Infantil Domingos A.

The Eagle Forum has been primarily focused on social issues; it describes itself as pro-family and reports membership of 80,000. Critics have described it as socially conservative and anti-feminist.Global Policy Forum - NGOs at the UN: Discrimination History Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly In 1967, Phyllis Schlafly launched the Eagle Trust Fund for receiving donations related to conservative causes. After the 1972 proposal of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Schlafly reorganized her efforts to defeat its ratification, founding the group \\"Stop ERA\\"Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States Sara Diamond. Guilford Press, 1995. and starting the Eagle Forum Newsletter. In 1975 Stop ERA was renamed the Eagle Forum. The Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund was organized in 1981 as a non- profit wing of Eagle Forum. It is a tax deductible charity under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code. Symbol used for signs and buttons by ERA opponents The Eagle Forum PAC began receiving donations in 1993 and has served as a source for candidate endorsements from the Eagle Forum and has donated money to various candidates that the organization People for the American Way has described as \\"right-wing\\". Eagle Forum members have often worked within the Republican Party. The Texas state Eagle Forum chairperson, Cathie Adams, for instance, was named Republican national committeewoman from Texas at the state convention in 2008 and then in October 2009 was chosen as interim chairperson of the Republican Party of Texas.  Political and social positions  The Eagle Forum is involved primarily in conservative issues. The organization uses grassroots techniques to promote conservative women's and family issues in public policy. According to the organization's website, the Eagle Forum's mission is \\"to enable conservative and pro-family men and women to participate in the process of self-government and public policy making so that America will continue to be a land of individual liberty, respect for family integrity, public and private virtue, and private enterprise.\\" On its website, the Eagle Forum states its invitation to \\"build a better educated, safer, stronger America based on traditional values.\\" It outlines its five missions as an organization: supporting American sovereignty, supporting American identity, supporting the Constitution, exposing radical feminists, and supporting a traditional education. The organization opposes the idea of opening borders to Mexico and Canada and are against international oversight from the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. In 2006, Eagle Forum began preparations to fight the supposed introduction of the Amero Northern American currency. The Eagle Forum supports English-only education in schools, saying that every child should be taught to read and write in English before first grade. The organization opposes \\"liberal propaganda\\" in schools, and supports parents' right to protect their children against such information. It has also been opposed to access to free daycare as well as sex education. The Eagle Forum was pegged by Schlafly as \\"the alternative to women's lib.\\" It is opposed to a number of feminist issues, which founder Phyllis Schlafly claimed were \\"extremely destructive\\" and \\"poisoned the attitudes of many young women.\\" The organization believes only in a family consisting of a father, mother and children. They are supportive of women's right to choose to be \\"fulltime homemakers\\", and oppose same-sex marriage. Eagle Forum opposes abortion and has defended the push for government defunding of Planned Parenthood. = Opposition to the ERA = After gaining publicity for her book, A Choice, Not an Echo, Phyllis Schlafly began her fight against the ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA had passed in the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 354 to 23. Five months later, the amendment passed in the Senate with a vote of 84 to 8, and 7 members abstaining. In order to be adopted into the Constitution, the amendment had to be ratified by three-fourths (38) of the states. Schlafly then reorganized her efforts to defeat its ratification, founding the group \\"STOP ERA\\" and starting the Eagle Forum Newsletter. STOP ERA was established in the fall of 1972 an organization dedicated to the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment. The group's name is an acronym for the phrase \\"Stop Taking Our Privileges.\\" In one issue of the Eagle Forum Newsletter, titled \\"Whats Wrong With Equal Rights for Women,” Schlafly argued against the ratification of the ERA on the basis that it would take rights and protections away from women. According to Schlafly, the passage of the ERA could \\"mean Government-funded abortions, homosexual schoolteachers, women forced into military combat and men refusing to support their wives.\\" The newsletter began to circulate, and many conservative women wrote to their legislators, relaying the concerns voiced by Schlafly in the Eagle Forum Newsletter. Support for The Eagle Forum grew with the support of many conservative women and various church groups, as did the opposition to the ERA. Many of the same women who had helped Schlafly distribute her book were involved with STOP ERA. Less than a year after its creation, STOP ERA had grown to several thousand members. State legislators were able to vote on the ERA beginning in March 1972 and were given a deadline in 1979. Within a year, thirty states had ratified the ERA, and the amendment needed only eight more states to pass. In 1977, STOP ERA protested the Equal Rights Amendment at the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas. STOP ERA claimed that the national plan of action that was proposed at the conference was “anti-family.\\" At the conference, Phyllis Schlafly teamed up with Indiana State Senator Joan Gubbins to form a \\"pro-life, pro-family\\" coalition to voice the conservative opposition to the ERA. Schlafly also testified against the potentially harmful effects of the ERA before Georgia, Virginia, Missouri, and Arkansas legislatures. STOP ERA’s tactics were successful; by the 1979 deadline the amendment still needed three states to pass. The ERA was then given a three- year extension, during which no states ratified or rescinded the amendment. By the time of the ERA's defeat, the Eagle Forum had reached 50,000 members. Since its initial defeat, the Equal Rights Amendment has been revisited by legislators, such as Carolyn Maloney.  Programs and activities  Two youth- oriented programs are also operated by the Forum: the \\"Teen Eagles\\" program for children ages 13–19, and the \\"Eagle Forum Collegians\\" for conservative- minded college students.

Despite being one of the most heavily used roads in the province, as of 2020, there is only approximately 36.5 km of the route that is divided highway; 34.5 km from Saskatoon to Delisle, including a recently completed bypass of Vanscoy, and 2 km just east of Rosetown at the Rosetown Airport and Cargill inland terminal. in 2020, the provincial government announced funding to install eight passing lanes east of Kindersley, as well as further plans for an additional six to the west, bringing the total number of passing lanes to 26 along the corridor and helping to improve safety until such a time as twinning the highway is financially feasible and traffic volumes require such. Extensive oil exploration and development has been occurring since 2010, primarily in the Kindersley Region, from Brock to the Alberta Border. Heavy traffic, agriculture, grain transport, and oilfield service, as well as oil and fuel transports, are common on this highway. Agriculture, and oilfield services are the main industries of the area. The only District hospital on Hwy 7 is located at Kindersley. Agrium Vanscoy Potash Operations is Canada's third largest producer of potash fertilizer. In the 1930s early homesteaders would maintain Highway 7 as a means to supplement their income. Provincial Highway 7 followed the Canadian Northern railway grade for direction of travel with the actual road way being on the square on the Dominion survey township lines. Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961. Highway 7 currently terminates at its junction with 22nd Street West (Highway 14) in west Saskatoon, although it is marked to run concurrently to Highway 11 (Idylwyld Drive). In 2005, work began on realigning Highway 7 in order to make way for the Blairmore Suburban Centre development including the Bethlehem High School, Tommy Douglas Collegiate and the Shaw Centre located where Highway 7 linked with 22nd Street prior to 2006. Route description The entirety of Highway 7 is a primary weight asphalt concrete (AS) national highway within the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SHS) West Central Municipal Government Committee planning jurisdiction. Travel on Highway 7 begins in the west at the Alberta - Saskatchewan provincial border through the Missouri Coteau which features mixed prairie vegetation. Entering Alberta, the highway continues west as Alberta Highway 9. Alsask is a village of about 150 people on the border and Highway 44. The Military Dome site radar station is a heritage site and has been acquired by Alsask along with the 1960s airforce base. At Alsask, Highway 7 turns northeast until km 3.9 when again the highway is routed east. Again at km 6.1 the highway turns northeast until km 19.8 just past the intersection with Highway 317. Marengo, a small village of about 50 residents is north of the junction. Highway 7 continues for several kilometres east reaching the village of Flaxcombe, which has a population of just over 100. Highway 307 north provides access to the villages of Coleville and Smiley. This area belongs to the West Central Regional Economic Development Authority (REDA). The town of Kindersley is the largest center featuring both oil and agricultural industries along Highway 7 and with a population of about 4,500 is almost at city status of 5,000 residents. As of 2009, the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) ranges from approximately 1,600 to 2,000 vehicles per day (vpd) near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to over 3,000 vpd near Kindersley, updated statistics, and vehicle types in 2013 show evidence that the 2009 vehicle count is out of date and severely understates actual traffic flow. Due to its being a key route between Calgary, the fast-growing city of Saskatoon, and economic drivers such as regional oil activity, inland grain terminal locations adjacent to Hwy 7, and Saskatchewan's strong economy, this highway's capacity is under pressure. Continuing east, Highway 7 comes to a short concurrency between Highway 658 south and Highway 658 north. The village of Netherhill is also located between the Highway 658 junction and Highway 30 junction.Feedlot near Delisle Highway 30 south provides access to the village of Brock. The highway takes a few gentle curves north east at km 106.1 through the unincorporated areas of Fiske and McGee to the junction with Highway 4. Rosetown is a town about half the size of Kindersley located at this junction. The Goose Lake Plain landscape area of the Moist Mixed Prairie ecoregion is the main feature between Rosetown and Saskatoon. The bearing of the highway continues northeast until the town of Zealandia whose population is hovering around 100 people. After Zealandia, the highway continues in a north-northeast direction coming to junction with Highway 768 north and the junction with Highway 655 west and with Highway 655 south. The village of Tessier is next along this northeast section of highway, and then Delisle. Delisle, a town, with a population of about 800 residents is located at the intersection of Highway 7, Highway 45 south, and Saskatchewan Highway 673 on the east side of town. The AADT along the route fluctuates between 2,000 and 3,000 vpd until Delisle. The newly aligned intersection Highway 673 is near the beginning of the divided highway leading to Saskatoon. The corner of Highway 672 south and Highway 762 eastintersects the old Highway 7 at the village of Vanscoy. Agrium Vanscoy Potash Mine is located southwest of Saskatoon, just to the northwest of Vanscoy. The potash mine was established in 1931 as Cominco Fertilizers Ltd. changing names in 1995 to Agrium Inc., the nation's third largest producer of potash The AADT on Highway 7 near Vanscoy increases to over 5,600 vpd. Both Highway 762 provides access to Pike Lake Provincial Park. Highway 7 continues northwesterly arriving at a split intersection, initially built with the potential to be upgraded to an interchange at km 249.7 with Highway 60 south.Highway 7 to Delisle The highway then crosses the Canadian National rail lines on an overpass, and intersects 11th Street followed by an at-grade crossing of the Canadian Pacific line. This twinned section of the highway handles between 7,000 and 12,000 vpd on average throughout the year. The 11th Street West intersection provides access from the south end of the City of Saskatoon to Highway 7. Highway 7 now ends at Highway 14 at the west end of Saskatoon: at a split intersection that includes the southern terminus for SK 684 (Neault Road); an interchange is planned for this location in the future. This is the new Blairmore Suburban Development Area (SDA) hosting seven new neighbourhoods and anchoring future growth on Saskatoon's west end. History Saskatoon is indicated by the red star The Old Bone Trail was the name of the red river cart trail between Saskatoon and Rosetown. The Saskatchewan Highway Act was established in 1922, in compliance with the 1919 Canadian highway act. At the initial stages of the Saskatchewan Highway Act, of provincial highways were gravel and the rest were earth roads. The road allowances were laid out as a part of the Dominion Land survey system for homesteading. Travel along the Provincial Highway 7 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances, barbed wire fencing and the Canadian Northern rail line. As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel, the first highway was designed on 90-degree, right-angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads. Mr. Ralph Glen Chapman an early 20th century settler in Pleasant Valley maintained of Highway 7. Mr. Block of the German Mennonite settlement at Fiske maintained a stretch of Highway 7 as a means of supplementing his income in the 1930s. In 1939, Andy Anderson in the same fashion, kept a stretch of Highway 7 clear. In 1944 the widening of Highway 7 was undertaken. The Elma rural municipality (R.M.) requested that an automatic warning system should be established at the level crossing of the Canadian National Railway and Highway 7. At this same time, the rural municipality requested that the hills be gravelled which are situated on either side of Flaxcombe. The third concern in 1948 was to construct an all-weather highway between Kindersley and Alsask, and this too was requested of the Department of Highways (DOH). In 1950, the rates of pay for roadwork were 60 cents an hour for a single labourer, 80 cents an hour for man and two horses, a labourer with four horses would earn C$1.00 per hour and for man with six horses $1.20 per hour In the 1950s the R.M. provided grants to the local snow plough club to keep the highway clear after storms. The 1951 oil strike at Coleville resulted in a Husky service station and bulk plant opening at Flaxcombe on Highway 7 in 1955. It was located on the railroad to facilitate loading crude oil into rail cars. Highway 7 was rebuilt between 1960 and 1961. Highway 7 currently terminates at its junction with 22nd Street West (Highway 14) in west Saskatoon. In 2005, work began on realigning Highway 7 in order to make way for the Blairmore Suburban Centre development including the Bethlehem High School, Tommy Douglas Collegiate and the Shaw Centre located where Highway 7 linked with 22nd Street prior to 2006. Starting in 2006, Highway 7 was linked with Betts Avenue, a new city street, which in turn intersected 22nd Street at a traffic signal. The city and province built an intersection farther west (but still with the city limits) at the junction of Highway 14 and Highway 684 (Dalmeny Road), at which point the new Highway 7 alignment links with this intersection. Long-term plans call for an interchange to be constructed here, and a link to be created from Highway 684 to the Yellowhead Highway in Saskatoon's north side, though it has not yet been announced whether the Highway 7 designation will be applied north of Highway 14.

He is the former chairman and chief executive of Informatica having served in the roles from 2004 until 2015. During his tenure as CEO, Abbasi helped to grow the company's revenue from $219 million to over $1 billion, and to increase the value of stock by over 800 percent. He was also a member of the executive committee of Oracle Corporation and led Oracle Tools and Oracle Education as senior vice president. He retired from these roles in 2003 after 20 years with the company and is credited with helping to grow the company from a startup into an industry leader. Abbasi joined the board of directors for the software company, Red Hat Inc. in 2011. In May 2016, Abbasi joined the board of directors for the San Francisco-based analytics company, New Relic.. And in August 2017, Abbasi joined the board of directors for San Francisco-based StreamSets, Inc., an innovator in smart data pipelines for data engineers. Early life and education Abbasi was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1956 and moved to various cities with his father, an air force official, before reaching the United States in 1974 to attend college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Abbasi graduated with honors and obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 1978. He later earned his masters in the same field in 1980. Career =Early career= Abbasi began his professional career as a product manager for Professional Computer Resources in 1980. He developed financial modeling software and ERP applications there before launching his own company, Outlook Software, Inc. =Oracle= Abbasi joined Oracle while the company was a startup in 1982, as the manager of Midwestern Sales. Following his success in sales, Abbasi became manager of user interface development in 1984 where he created Oracle's first application programming tool, SQL*Forms. The software was first introduced in 1985 and was used by over 90 percent of all Oracle DBMS shops by 1990. Abbasi also launched the software tools division at Oracle, which includes application development tools, business intelligence tools, e-business portal tools and pharmaceutical and Internet learning applications. He helped grow the tools division of the company from its initial launch to generating revenues of $3.75 billion during his tenure with the company. By 1989, he was named the vice-president of Tools and Multi-media for the company. Abbasi was promoted further in 1994 to senior vice-president of Tools Product Division. From 2001 until his retirement from the company in 2003, Abbasi held the role of senior vice president in both the Tools and Education divisions. He retired from Oracle in 2003 after 20 years and is credited with helping the company grow from a 30 employee startup with $4 million in revenue, to a company with more than 40,000 employees and revenue near $10 billion. =Informatica= In 2004, Abbasi joined the software company, Informatica, as chief executive officer. Before Abbasi joined the company it had reported negative product license growth in 10 of the prior 12 quarters. Under his leadership, Informatica streamlined its operations by cutting its analytic application software development and focusing on the data warehousing component of its business. The decision was controversial at the time with resistance among employees and on the board, but Abbasi refocused the company on a narrower set of products, while evangelizing the broader use of data integration across the enterprise. The company grew its core market, eventually increasing its revenue from $219 million in fiscal 2004 to $455 million in 2008. Informatica's 20 percent growth rate over this period was 2.5 times the average for the software industry. During the recession, Abbasi urged the company's salespeople to focus on smaller business-critical deals rather than waiting to close bigger ones that might not materialize. The company concluded 2009 with $456 million in sales with an increase in revenue for each of the first three quarters of the year. Abbasi led the company through the recession with it experiencing 10 percent revenue growth and 20 percent non-GAAP net income growth, while non- GAAP operating margins expanded 3% to an annual record 25%. The company's growth also allowed hiring and expansion to continue through the recession. In 2010, Informatica reached a revenue of $650 million a nearly 300% increase over the revenue the company had experienced when Abbasi became CEO and a 31% increase from the year before. That same year Abbasi helped the company to grow its sales outside of North America to 36% of its business. In 2014, after ten years of Abbasi's leadership, Informatica reached $1 billion in sales. In April 2015, Informatica announced that shareholders had approved the acquisition by Permira funds and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.3 billion or roughly $48 a share. After the deal was completed, Abbasi stepped down as CEO and remained with the company as chairman. During his tenure as CEO the company's customer base increased from around 2,100 in 2004, to over 5,000 in 2014, employee count during this same time grew from 837 to 3,664. The company's annual profitability increased by over 850 percent and its stock appreciated over 800 percent during the same time period. Philanthropy In 2003, Abbasi and his wife, Sara, created a $2.5 million endowment for a program in Islamic studies at Stanford University. The program included graduate fellowships, research, a new library, stronger language courses at advanced levels, and regular public events such as lectures by eminent scholars. At the same time, Stanford alumna Lysbeth Warren made a gift of US$2 million for a new professorship on Islam. Stanford matched both gifts with a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, bringing the total endowment for the program and professorship to US$9 million. The Abbasis established the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to help the university maintain its position as a national leader in computer science. They also founded the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Computer Science Fellowship to allow students, preferably from Pakistan, to attend the institution. Abbasi also played a key role in establishing the Oracle Academic Initiative in Pakistan, which has trained hundreds of professionals. Recognition During his tenure with Informatica, Abbasi received several awards for his performance. Abbasi won the Chairman of the Year Award from the American Business Awards in 2010 and was ranked second by Institutional Investor's annual survey of software company CEO's in 2010 and 2011. In 2013, Bloomberg ranked Abbasi second on its Top 20 list of technology leaders. In 2014, according to Forbes, Abbasi was one of the top 5 best CEOs to work for in the Enterprise Software business in 2014.

She was used on the Southampton - Channel Islands - St Malo service until she sank in 1905 with the loss of at least 125 lives. Construction Hilda was built by Aitkin & Mansel, Whiteinch, Glasgow at a cost of £33,000. She was yard number 117 and was launched in July 1882. Completion was in January 1883. Hilda was long, with a beam of and a depth of . Hilda was powered by two compound steam engines which were made by John and James Thompson and Company, Glasgow. They had cylinders of and bore by stroke. The 1894-fitted boilers were made by Day, Summers and Company, of the Northam Iron Works, Southampton. These gave her a speed of . She was , and had a licensed passenger capacity of 566. Hilda carried six lifeboats with a capacity of 348 people, as well as 12 lifebuoys and 318 lifejackets. Service Hilda completed her sea trials on 13 January 1883 and was handed over to the LSWR that day. She was employed on the Southampton - Jersey - St Malo Service. On 7 October 1890, she was replaced by on that service and transferred to the direct service between Southampton and St Malo. In 1894, new boilers were fitted by Day, Summers and Company and electric light was fitted throughout the ship. Sinking Hilda had left Southampton at 22:00 on 17 November 1905 on her regular service to Saint-Malo in Brittany. She was carrying 103 passengers. Thick fog forced her to anchor off Yarmouth, Isle of Wight to await better weather conditions. The voyage was resumed at 06:00 on 18 November. Hilda passed through the Race of Alderney at 12:30, and after leaving Jersey behind, the weather conditions worsened. By 18:00, Hilda was approaching St Malo. The lights from the town were visible, as was the Jardin Lighthouse but snow squalls reduced visibility and Captain Gregory was forced to abandon the attempt to reach port. Grand Jardin Lighthouse Several times the visibility improved briefly but then deteriorated. Hilda was forced to abandon each attempt to reach port. Around 23:00, the visibility improved again and another attempt to enter the harbour was made. A few minutes later, Hilda struck the Pierre de Portes rocks, which lie to the west of the entrance channel to St Malo harbour. Distress rockets were fired and the passengers donned their lifejackets. Attempts were made to launch the lifeboats, but five of them either could not be launched or were dashed to pieces on the rocks. The sixth washed up at Saint-Cast-le-Guildo, some west of St Malo. The tide was ebbing, and Hilda broke in two some 15 minutes after running aground. About 20 or 30 people on the stern part of the wreck managed to climb the rigging to await rescue. By 09:00 on 19 November, when they were discovered by SS Ada, only six remained. A total of 125 people had died. Amongst the dead were 70 Breton \\"Onion Johnnies\\" returning from selling produce in Britain. Captain William Gregory had been employed by London and South Western Railway for 36 years. He joined the company in 1869 at the age of 20. His first command was in 1880. In 1885, he was appointed as master of Hilda. The only surviving crew member was able-bodied seaman James Grinter. He had been twice shipwrecked before. The five surviving passengers were Olivier Caroff of Roscoff, Tanguy Laot of Cléder, Jean Louis Mouster of La Feuillée, Paul-Marie Pen of Cléder and Louis Rozec of Plouzévédé. Another London and South Western Railway steamer, SS Stella, was wrecked on The Casquets, Channel Islands, on 30 March 1899 with 112 fatalities. On 21 February 1907 the Great Eastern Railway suffered the loss of SS Berlin, wrecked off the Hook of Holland with 141 fatalities. Inquiry An inquiry was held under The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 into the circumstances of the loss of Hilda. It was held at the Caxton Hall, Caxton St, London with the Court of Inquiry sitting on 1, 2 and 8 February 1906. The inquiry found that the ship was seaworthy, with lifesaving equipment provision meeting the legislated standard of the time. There was no finding of recklessness or negligence on the part of Captain Gregory. The wreck today The remains of Hilda lie at in of water at high tide. The engines, boilers, propellor shaft and some ironwork remain. The propellor was removed in 1997 and is on display in Dinard. In November 2005, an exhibition was held in St Malo commemorating the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck. On 19 November, flowers were cast upon the water at the wreck site in memory of the victims, and some divers placed a string of onions on the wreck in memory of the Onion Johnnies. A memorial service was held in St Malo Cathedral on 20 November.

It is situated at about 150 km from Mysuru and about 210 km from Bengaluru. The ancient and sacred temple of Sri Male Mahadeshwara is a pilgrim centre where Mahadeshwara lived, practiced medicine as Sidda,taught ahimsa to people in and around the seven hills.It draws lakhs of pilgrims from the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The area of the present temple surroundings is . In addition, the temple has lands at Talabetta, Haleyuru and Indiganatha villages. Amidst dense forest, the temple attracts not only the pilgrims but also nature lovers. The height of the hill is about 3000 feet above sea level. The temple tank The bus station The temple complex Mahadeshwara Temple entrance and Nandhi Devoutees at M.M.Hills The Lord Sri Mahadeshwara is believed to be the incarnation of Lord Shiva. Historical evidences suggest that the Saint Mahadeshwara must have lived during the 15th century. About 600 years ago, he came here to perform penance and it is believed that he is still performing penance in the temple's garbha gudi in the form of a linga. The linga, worshipped now in the garbha gudi, is a self-manifested (swayambhu) one. Sri Male Mahadeshwara Swamy was moving on a tiger known as Huli Vahana (Tiger as a vehicle) and performed a number of miracles around the Betta to save the people and saints living there. The Lord Sri Mahadeshwara's miracles are sometimes sung by the village folk in Janapada Style.  The story of Mahadeshwara  According to legends, Lord Male Mahadeshwara was born in the Kaliyuga to a fair coloured woman known as Uttarajamma. He has spiritually guided by then pontiff of Suttur Mutt and Kunthur Mutt. The young saint is supposed to have come from Srishaila to this part of the state. He is said to have performed several miracles in his life, in these places. Afterwards he went to the hills of Male Mahadeshwara. It is a dense forest area surrounded by seventy seven peaks in seven circles. It was not a safe place for human habitation. It was about six centuries ago that the young saint went in to the forest area, to save the saints who were performing penance and were taken captive by an evil king known as Shravana who possessed abundant black magic power. Apart from this there were tribes living here and there in small groups who were devoid of any rays of human civilization. It is said that Sri Mahadeshwara destroyed the black magic power of Shravana and released the saints who were in his prison. The place where they were kept captive is also a holy place, called Thavasere and the place where Shravana lived is called Shravana Boli. According to tradition there are seven peaks identified in the legend, which are as follows : Anumale, Jenumale, Kanumale, Pachchemale, Pavalamale, Ponnachimale and Kongumale. These seven peaks together form the M.M.Betta. It is said that the saint Lord Mahadeshwara established a Mutt here for looking after the religious and cultural affairs of the people of this area. It is also said that, through his miracles, he enlightened and uplifted the hill tribes & made them his disciples. The people coming from these families have become hereditary 'Archaks' of the Mahadeshwara temple. The temple was under the control & management of Sri Salur Mutt established by the Lord Mahadeshwara himself until it was handed over to the Madras Government in the year 1953. After the formation of the state of Karnataka, the administration of the Temples is done by the trust committee, appointed by the Karnataka Government under the Muzrai Department.  Tourism  On M.M.Hills Male Mahadeshwara Hills have become a tourist destination of Chamarajanagar district. The hilltop of well developed with paved roads and tiled footpaths. Visitors are allotted separate villas to stay on payment of a small amount. There are many shops sellings curios and pooja items. About 50 years ago there was no road facilities to this place. People used to reach the place by walking. At present there are road connections from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu States. More than 100 buses are plying in this route everyday. There are several places of historical interest in this area to which the devotees often pay their visits. A pilgrimage to Male Mahadeswara temple also includes a holy dip in the \\"antaragange\\", a stream flowing from a perennial source.  Kamsale  The song and dance routine is called Kamsale. Kamsale is closely connected with a tradition of Shiva worship. Only those who have vowed to live a life of devotion to Mahadeshwara are supposed to perform kamsale. The dance is a part of a 'deeksha' or oath and is taught by a teacher or spiritual leader. Kamsale artists are illiterates and have no printed literature. They learn those songs orally. They participate in fairs, which are held in Mahadeshwara Betta during 'Deepavali', 'Shivaratri' and 'Ugadi' festivals. Hence, Mahadeshwara is also known as Badawara devaru Madappa \\"Chellidaru Malligeya\\" is a famous folk song that describes the devotion and worship of lord Mahadeshwara. \\"kamsale mainly seen in karthika Mondays and shivarathri in m m hill \\"  Epic  The epic story of Mahadeshwara describes the life and miracles of the saint. The outer structure of the epic resembles the pan-Indian Ramayana : Shiva incarnates himself on earth as Mahadeshwara to destroy an evil king called Shravanasura ('The Hero as Saviour' motif). The epic has seven parts; and normally, only certain parts are sung as dictated by the taste of the audience or patron. However, the entire epic is sung by some pilgrims on their way to the annual fair on the Mahadeshwara Betta; and it may last for seven consecutive nights. The epic (single-narrator version) has seven parts. After traditional invocation, the first part narrates the immaculate birth, childhood, and spiritual quest of Mahadeshwara. The second part narrates the ways through which Mahadeshwara gets a wealthy farmer Junje Gowda as his devotee to build him a temple on the Seven Betta. The next part is devoted to the destruction of the evil king, Shravanasura. Next we have the longest and most moving episode called 'Sankamma kathe'. This episode dramatises the suffering of a proud woman called 'Sankamma,' and the ordeals that she successfully undergoes in order to retain her dignity as a virtuous wife. The fifth episode, slightly comic in tone, depicts the rise and fall of a vainglorious and miserly woman, called 'Bevinatti Kalamma.' The last but one episode narrates how Mahadeshwara gets two simple and god-fearing people, Moogayya and his wife, as his devotee religion family. Mugayya family the grandson mahadeshwara . The concluding part, besides traditional ending with benediction, gives a brief summary of the entire epic.  Forest wealth  Apart from being a pilgrimage centre, M.M.Hills possess large tracts of forest area. The landscapes of Betta and valleys are covered with forests. These forest types vary from evergreen forests in Ponnachi Boli to dry deciduous forests in most other parts. M.M.Betta is bound by the river Kaveri to the north-east and by the river Palar to the south. The forests of M.M.Betta have been famous for wonderful regeneration and stock of sandalwood and bamboo. The forests are inhabited by a variety of animals, birds and reptiles. They are found in large numbers too. Elephants are the most prominent species. The latest estimate puts the population of elephants are more than 2500 in the district, which includes Bandipur National Park too. Frequent sightings of guars (Indian bison), sambars, spotted deer, jackals, sloth bears, porcupine, etc., apart from rare sightings of tigers, leopards and wild dogs are possible in and around this area. The Male Mahadeshwara Reserve Forests, has an approximate area of 39361.45 hectares and has a few small villages like Ponnachi, Kombadikki, Kokkebore, Doddane, Tokere, Tulsikere,Puduru village ,Thambadi street, Palar, Gopinatham, Indiganatham, etc., as enclosures within the reserve forests.Mahadeswara Hills According to media reportshttp://www.deccanherald.com/content/332875/male-mahadeshwara-wildlife- sanctuary-comes.html a decision to declare (90,618.75 hectares) of of the Kollegalaa Range forest as Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary was taken during the fifth meeting of the Karnataka Wildlife Board held on 15 December 2012.

In June 2016, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp reached an agreement to buy the company. The sale was completed in September 2016. Prior to the acquisition, Wireless Group was a constituent of the FTSE SmallCap Index. History =Background= Havelock House. The company relocated to City Quays 2 in 2018. The current UTV Limited (originally Ulster Television plc), which began in 1959 as an ITV franchise holder in Northern Ireland, purchased ISP Direct Net Access in March 2000 for £4.4m, rebranding it as UTV Internet and later UTV Connect. The service expanded into telephone market under UTV Talk in August 2004 and also provided broadband and fibre optic packages for Northern Ireland, the Republic and the rest of the UK. The service was sold to Rainbow Communications and Vodafone Ireland in 2014. The company also set up an online car dealership UTV Drive, created in partnership with Abbey Insurance, which was sold in 2014.UTV Drive Further expansion took place with the move into radio, starting in Cork with 96FM and C103 in 2001. Further acquisitions were undertaken over the next decade, with the largest investment being the purchase of The Wireless Group in 2005 for £97m, boosting its radio portfolio with additional local stations, digital radio multiplexes and national station Talksport. In 2005, the group also launched its first station, U105, which broadcasts to the Belfast area, and purchased Juice FM in Liverpool .

It is a port city and oil terminus located 26 km north of the city of Iskenderun, near the easternmost point of the Mediterranean at the head of the Gulf of İskenderun. Geography The name Dörtyol means \\"crossroads\\" (literally \\"four roads\\") in Turkish, and indeed the town sits on a crossing of highways, especially the O-53 from Anatolia south into Hatay and on to Syria. The road is channelled along the narrow coastal strip with the Nur Mountains (the ancient Amanos) behind. Dörtyol is at the edge of the Çukurova Plain and being near the coast, is humid and the countryside is fairly green and fertile. Therefore, as well as oil-handling, the economic activities of the district include forestry, cotton, and the cultivation of citrus fruits, especially a local variety of tangerine. History This crossroads has seen the passage of numerous armies and some of the biggest military campaigns in history, including the Battle of Issus between Alexander the Great and Darius in 333 BC. In 1895 the Armenians of Chorkmarzban resisted the Hamidian Massacres. In 1909 during the Adana Massacre the Armenians of Dörtyol or Chorkmarzban resisted the massacres again, but large numbers perished. From 1919-1921 the Armenians again resisted the Armenian Genocide, but were almost completely exterminated. After the French and Turks agreed on the Syrian-Turkish border, Dörtyol fell on the Turkish side, and the surviving Armenians fled to Alexandretta, Aleppo, and Amman. More recently Dörtyol is remembered in Turkey as the scene of the first fighting in the Turkish War of Independence. The fighting with the occupying forces was ignited in Karakese which is located on the edge of the Nur mountains village. In 1918 Dörtyol was occupied by French troops.

ASAS-North telescopes at Haleakala, Maui, HI The All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) is a Polish project implemented on 7 April 1997 to do photometric monitoring of approximately 20 million stars brighter than 14 magnitude all over the sky.ASAS Home page - Highlights The automatic telescopes discovered two new comets in 2004 and 2006. The ASAS- South, located in Chile and ASAS-North, located in Hawai'i, are managed by Grzegorz Pojmański of the Warsaw University Observatory via the internet. The idea was initiated by the Polish astronomy Professor Bohdan Paczyński of Princeton University. The prototype instrument and data pipeline were designed and built by Grzegorz Pojmański. The work on the ASAS program began in 1996 with a mere $1 million budget. The automatic telescope, located in Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, was designed to register the brightness of circa one million stars in the Southern Hemisphere. However, it proved very efficient and helped to find many new variable stars. The project was then expanded, and now operates four telescopes located in Las Campanas Observatory. The Chilean observatory is operated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.Polish telescope discovers new comet article in AngolaPress So far, ASAS has discovered 50,000 variables located south of declination +28°, which means that it has covered 3/4 of all the sky. Pojmański comes to Chile only once every year. The telescope works automatically. Routine work such as exchanging of the data is done by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) observers. Such an intervention is needed once a week. On each starry night when an OGLE observator opens or closes the dome, the ASAS booth is opened or closed automatically. Bohdan Paczyński tells about ASAS during the ceremony of awarding him with the title of doctor honoris causa by Wrocław University Grzegorz Pojmański is supported in the project by the State Committee for Scientific Research, Poland. The project is assisted by OGLE observers. Paczyński was supported by William Golden. The ASAS 1-2 systems The prototype ASAS instrument, equipped with 768x512 Kodak CCD and 135/1.8 telephoto lens, and mounted on the computer controlled robotic mount, operated from 7 April 1997 until 6 June 2000. Prototype took about 15 3-minute exposures (covering 90 sq. deg.) per hour (over 120 per night) with limiting I-magnitude 13 and resolution of 14 arcsec/pixel. Initial setup consisted of 24 fields covering 150 sq. deg. (later increased to 50 fields - 300 sq. deg) monitored few times each night.The ASAS 1-2 systems ASAS 2 results obtained during 1997-2000 available at the ASAS website contain: * The ASAS-2 Photometric I-band Catalog - giving interactive access to over 50 million measurements of over 140,000 stars, * Sky Atlas - graphic interface to the I-band Catalog, * The ASAS-2 Catalog of Variable Stars containing over 350 Periodic and 3500 Miscellaneous variables, * The ASAS Gallery presenting collection of the variables' light curves. The ASAS-3 system On 6 June 2000 the ASAS-3 system replaced the low-cost prototype. It consists of two wide-field 200/2.8 instruments, one narrow-field 750/3.3 telescope and one super-wide 50/4 scope. Each of them is equipped with the Apogee 2Kx2K CCD camera, located in the custom-made automated enclosure. In April 2002 ASAS-3 was expanded and is now housing four instruments. The fourth one is a very- wide-field scope equipped with the 50 mm lens and another AP-10 camera. It features 36x26 deg. FOV and observes only a few selected fields in purpose to test instrument sensitivity for fast transient events.

The company was revived for short seasons and tours from 1988 to 2003, and with Scottish Opera it later co-produced two productions. In 1875 Richard D'Oyly Carte asked the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan to collaborate on a short comic opera to round out an evening's entertainment. When that work, Trial by Jury, became a success, Carte put together a syndicate to produce a full-length Gilbert and Sullivan work, The Sorcerer (1877), followed by H.M.S. Pinafore (1878). After Pinafore became an international sensation, Carte jettisoned his difficult investors and formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan that became the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The company produced the succeeding ten Gilbert and Sullivan operas and many other operas and companion pieces, mostly at the Savoy Theatre in London, which Carte built in 1881 for that purpose. The company also mounted tours in Britain, New York and elsewhere, usually running several companies simultaneously. Carte's able assistant, Helen Lenoir, became his wife in 1888 and, after his death in 1901, she ran the company until her own death in 1913. By this time, it had become a year-round Gilbert and Sullivan touring repertory company. Carte's son Rupert inherited the company. Beginning in 1919, he mounted new seasons in London with new set and costume designs, while continuing the year-round tours in Britain and abroad. With the help of the director J. M. Gordon and the conductor Isidore Godfrey, Carte ran the company for 35 years. He redesigned the Savoy Theatre in 1928 and sponsored a series of recordings over the years that helped to keep the operas popular. After Rupert's death in 1948, his daughter Bridget inherited the company and hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager. The company continued to tour for 35 weeks each year, issue new recordings and play London seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan. In 1961 the last copyright on the Gilbert and Sullivan operas expired, and Bridget set up and endowed a charitable trust that presented the operas until mounting costs and a lack of public funding forced the closure of the company in 1982. It re-formed in 1988 with a legacy left by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, played short tours and London seasons, and issued some popular recordings. Denied significant funding from the English Arts Council, it suspended productions in 2003. With Scottish Opera, it co- produced The Pirates of Penzance 2013 and The Mikado in 2016. Some of the company's performers, over the decades, became stars of their day and often moved on to careers in musical theatre or grand opera. The company licensed the operas for performance in Australasia and to numerous amateur troupes in Britain and elsewhere, providing orchestra parts and prompt books for hire. The company kept the Savoy operas in the public eye for over a century and left an enduring legacy of production styles and stage business that continue to be emulated in new productions, as well as recordings. History =Beginnings= Richard D'Oyly Carte By 1874, Richard D'Oyly Carte, a musician and ambitious young impresario, had begun producing operettas in London.Jacobs, Arthur. \\"Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)\\" . Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008 He announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for one of his productions that year: \\"It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light opera.\\"\\"Our Representative Man\\", Punch, 10 October 1874, p. 151 The Observer reported, \\"Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction\\".The Observer, 23 August 1874, p. 3 He wanted to establish a body of tasteful English comic opera that would appeal to families, in contrast to the bawdy burlesques and adaptations of French operettas and opera bouffes that dominated the London musical stage at that time.Ainger, pp. 108–109; Joseph (1994), p. 11; and Stedman, pp. 128–130 In early 1875 Carte was managing London's Royalty Theatre. Needing a short piece to round out an evening's entertainment featuring the popular Offenbach operetta La Périchole he brought W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan together. On tour in 1871, Carte had conducted Sullivan's one-act comic opera Cox and Box,\\"Public Amusements\\", Liverpool Mercury, 2 September 1871, p. 6 which received an 1874 London revival. In 1873 Gilbert had offered a libretto to Carte about an English courtroom, but at the time Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music.Stedman, p. 125 Carte remembered Gilbert's libretto and suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan write the music for a one-act comic opera, Trial by Jury, which was quickly composed and added to the Royalty's bill in March 1875.Ainger, p. 108McElroy, George. \\"Whose Zoo; or, When Did the Trial Begin?\\", Nineteenth Century Theatre Research, 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54 The witty and \\"very English\\" little piece proved even more popular than La Périchole and became the first great success of Carte's scheme to found his school of English comic opera, playing for 300 performances from 1875 to 1877, as well as touring and enjoying many revivals.The Times, 29 March 1875, p. 10, quoted and discussed in Ainger, p. 109. See also Stedman, pp. 129–130; Ainger, pp. 111 and 117; and Rollins and Witts, pp. 1–18. At the Theatre Royal, in Dublin, Ireland in September 1875, while managing the first tour of Trial by Jury, Carte met an owner of the theatre, Michael Gunn, who was fascinated by Carte's vision for establishing a company to promote English comic opera. Gunn later joined Carte's management team.Ainger, pp. 111, 157, 169–171, 184 and 193 Still, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of three English adaptations of French opera bouffe and two one-act English curtain raisers (Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury). Carte himself was the musical director of this travelling company, which disbanded after the tour.Stone, David. Biography of Carte at the Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company website, 27 August 2001, accessed 14 October 2009Liverpool Mercury, 4 July 1876, p. 6 Helen Lenoir Carte found four financial backers and formed the Comedy Opera Company in 1876 to produce more works by Gilbert and Sullivan, along with the works of other British lyricist/composer teams.Ainger, p. 130 With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera.Ainger, pp. 110, 119–20 and 130–31; Jacobs, p. 109 Carte leased the Opera Comique, a small theatre off The Strand.Burgess, Michael. \\"Richard D'Oyly Carte\\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7–11 In February 1877 Carte engaged a novice Scottish actress, Helen Lenoir, for a small role in a touring production. She soon left the tour and obtained a position in Carte's entertainment agency. Lenoir was well-educated, and her grasp of detail and diplomacy, as well as her organisational ability and business acumen, surpassed even Carte's. Frank Desprez, the editor of The Era, wrote: \\"Her character exactly compensated for the deficiencies in his.\\"Desprez, Frank. \\"The Late Mrs. D'Oyly Carte\\", The Era, 10 May 1913, p. 19 She became intensely involved in all of his business affairs and soon managed many of the company's responsibilities, especially concerning touring. She travelled to America numerous times over the years to arrange the details of the company's New York engagements and American tours.Stedman, Jane W. \\"Carte, Helen (1852–1913)\\" . Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008 The first comic opera produced by the Comedy Opera Company was Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer, about a tradesmanlike London sorcerer. It opened in November 1877 together with Dora's Dream, a curtain-raiser with music by Sullivan's assistant Alfred Cellier and words by Arthur Cecil, a friend of both Gilbert and Sullivan.Ainger, p. 140 Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in Victorian theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support. They were therefore able to select their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre. They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time. Carte's talent agency provided many of the artists to perform in the new work. They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers.Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–134 Some of the cast members, including principal comedian George Grossmith, Richard Temple and Rutland Barrington, stayed with the company for almost 15 years. Two other longstanding members of the company were Rosina Brandram, who started in D'Oyly Carte touring companies with The Sorcerer, and Jessie Bond who joined the group for Pinafore at the Opera Comique in 1878.Ainger, p. 152 As Grossmith wrote in 1888, \\"We are all a very happy family.\\"Grossmith, Chapter VI Knowing that Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of broadening the audience for British light opera by increasing its quality and respectability, Carte gave Gilbert wider authority as a director than was customary among Victorian producers, and Gilbert tightly controlled all aspects of production, including staging, design and movement.Vorder Bruegge, Andrew. \\"W.

For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings .... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.\\"Jacobs, p. 113 The Sorcerer ran for 178 performances, a healthy run at the time, making a profit,Ainger, pp. 147–148 and Carte sent out a touring company in March 1878.

Pinafore, opened in May 1878.

Carte used the enforced closure of the theatre to invoke a contract clause reverting the rights of Pinafore and Sorcerer to Gilbert and Sullivan after the initial run of H.M.S. Pinafore.Ainger, pp. 165–167 Carte then took a six-month personal lease on the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879.Stedman, p. 170 Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.Joseph (1994), p. 18 The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name \\"Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company\\".Ainger, pp. 162–167 Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits. On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.Ainger, pp. 170–172 Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery.Stedman, pp. 170–71\\"The Fracas at the Opera Comique\\" .

Pirates was the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera to have its official premiere in America. Carte and his partners hoped to forestall further \\"piracy\\" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

As Jessie Bond described in her autobiography: > No lingering about was allowed, no gossiping with the other actors; the > women’s dressing-rooms were on one side of the stage, the men's on the > other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our > respective narrow staircases – sheep rigorously separated from the goats! > Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling > in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her > behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and > actresses, conventual in their austerity. ...

It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).Wearing, J. P. (\\"The London West End Theatre in the 1890s\\" . Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 29, No. 3 (October 1977), pp. 320–332, The Johns Hopkins University Press (online by subscription to JSTOR) Patience was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881. The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology.Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book) The Times concluded that the theatre \\"is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with.\\"\\"The Savoy Theatre\\", The Times, 11 October 1881, p. 8 Carte and his manager, George Edwardes (later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre), introduced several innovations at the theatre, including numbered seating, free programme booklets, the \\"queue\\" system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services. Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.Dark and Grey, p. 85 The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premièred at the Savoy. During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, the company also produced operas by other composer–librettist teams, either as curtain-raisers to the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces, or as touring productions, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between Savoy operas, and Carte also toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas extensively. For example, a souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York shows that, aside from these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing two companies touring with Patience, two companies touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a company touring with Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham) a company touring Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.250th Anniversary Patience programme, 1881 In the 1880s Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing their popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.Joseph (1994), pp. 81 and 163Bradley (2005), p. 25 This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies \\"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\\"Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393 Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \\"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\\".Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394 The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year. Carte insisted that amateur companies follow the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company staging, using its prompt books. Even after the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, the company continued to, and still does, rent out band parts to companies around the world.Bradley (2005), pp. 30 and 68; see also the services page at the D'Oyly Carte Opera company website =Iolanthe to The Gondoliers= After Patience, the company produced Iolanthe, which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obligating them to create new operas for the company upon six months' notice.Baily, p. 251 Sullivan had not intended immediately to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.Ainger, pp. 217–219 But he soon felt trapped.Jacobs, p. 188 The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, regarding the agreement: \\"Effectively, it made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments.\\"Crowther, Andrew. \\"The Carpet Quarel (sic) Explained\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 June 1997, accessed 30 August 2020 The partnership's next opera, Princess Ida, opened in January 1884.Ainger, pp. 225–226 Carte soon saw that Ida was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners for a new opera to be written. Almost from the beginning of the partnership, the musical establishment put pressure on Sullivan to abandon comic opera, and he soon regretted having signed the five-year contract. In March 1884 Sullivan told Carte that \\"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\\" Lithograph from The Mikado During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently had to smooth over the partners' differences with a mixture of friendship and business acumen.Joseph (1994), p. 27 Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.Jacobs, Arthur. \\"Sullivan, Arthur Seymour\\" . Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 11 April 2009 Nevertheless, they coaxed eight comic operas out of Gilbert and Sullivan in the 1880s.Joseph (1994), pp. 18–19 When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. To make matters worse, Gilbert suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected, and he now rejected the \\"lozenge plot\\" again. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.Ainger, pp. 230–233 The company produced the first revival of The Sorcerer, together with Trial by Jury, and matinees of The Pirates of Penzance played by a cast of children, while waiting for the new work to be completed. This became the partnership's most successful opera, The Mikado, which opened in March 1885.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13 The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan. At the same time, it took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic Far East using the \\"picturesque\\" scenery and costumes of Japan.Jones, Brian. \\"Japan in London 1885\\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, issue 22, Winter 2007, pp. 686–696 The Mikado became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, the second longest run for any work of musical theatre up to that time, and it was extraordinarily popular in the U.S. and worldwide. It remains the most frequently performed Savoy opera.Kenrick, John. \\"G&S101;: G&S; Story: Part III\\" , Musicals101.com, accessed 8 October 2009 Beginning with The Mikado, Hawes Craven, the designer of the sets for Henry Irving's spectacular Shakespeare productions at the Lyceum Theatre, designed all the D'Oyly Carte sets until 1893. The partnership's next opera was Ruddigore, which opened in January 1887. It satirised and used elements of Victorian stock melodrama.Walmisley, Guy H. and Claude A. Excerpt about Ruddigore from Tit- Willow; or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas (London: 1964), reproduced at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 9 January 2005 accessed 12 October 2009 The piece, though profitable, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary success of The Mikado.Jacobs, p. 248 When Ruddigore closed after a run of only nine months, the company mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a \\"lozenge plot\\", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for The Yeomen of the Guard, which premiered in October 1888.Ainger, p. 270 The opera was a success, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, in March 1889, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a \\"dramatic work on a larger musical scale\\".Jacobs, p. 287 Gilbert declined, but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a grand opera (Ivanhoe) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera.Jacobs, p. 288 The new comic opera was The Gondoliers, which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.Baily, p. 344 After Carte's first wife died in 1885, Carte married Helen Lenoir in 1888, who was, by this time, nearly as important in managing the company as Carte himself. 220px During these years, the company's high production values, and the quality of the operas, created a national and international taste for them, and the company mounted touring productions throughout the provinces, in America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891. Bernard Shaw, writing in The World in October 1893, commented, \\"Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages, taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colours on the stage, the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers, the quality of the orchestra, and the degree of artistic good breeding, so to speak, expected from the principals, best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D'Oyly Carte.\\"\\"Utopian Gilbert and Sullivan\\", The World, 11 October 1893, reprinted in Laurence, pp. 975–976 =The Carpet Quarrel and the end of the partnership= On 22 April 1890, during the run of The Gondoliers, Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert confronted Carte, and Carte refused to reconsider the accounts: Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert wrote in a letter to Sullivan that \\"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\\". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \\"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\\"Stedman, p. 270 Gilbert brought a lawsuit, but Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the Royal English Opera House, the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera. Gilbert won the suit, but the partnership disbanded.Shepherd, Marc. \\"Introduction: Historical Context\\", The Grand Duke, p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009; linked at \\"The Grand Duke\\" . The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 7 July 2009 Sullivan's opera, Ivanhoe, had a successful run, but Carte did not find suitable successors for the theatre, and it soon failed. He sold it, and it later became the Palace Theatre.\\"The Palace Theatre\\", The Times, 12 December 1892, p. 7; \\"The Theatres in 1892\\", The Times, 31 December 1892, p. 3; and \\"Palace Theatre as Cinema.

The D'Oyly Carte company turned to new writing teams for the Savoy, first producing The Nautch Girl, by George Dance, Desprez and Edward Solomon, which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Next was a revival of Solomon and Sydney Grundy's The Vicar of Bray, which played through the summer of 1892. Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall then held the stage until April 1893.Joseph (1994), p. 111 While the company presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, Carte's touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.\\"The Savoyards on Tour\\", The Sketch, 13 June 1894, pp. 373–374 Grossmith comforts Carte after failure of The Grand Duke. Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Sullivan and Carte, but the partnership had been so profitable that the Cartes eventually sought to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan. The reconciliation finally came through the efforts of Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to the Savoy operas.Wolfson, p. 7 In 1893 the company produced the penultimate Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, Utopia, Limited. While Utopia was being prepared, the company produced Jane Annie, by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing in July 1893 after only 51 performances.Tillett, Selwyn. \\"Jane Annie\\", in Sullivan Society Journal, 1993 centenary issue on Utopia, Limited Utopia was the Savoy's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894, turning a very modest profit. The company then played first Mirette, composed by André Messager, then The Chieftain, by F. C. Burnand and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15 After The Chieftain closed, the company toured the London suburbs, while Carte leased the Savoy Theatre to the Carl Rosa Opera Company. The theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of The Mikado.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52 This was followed by The Grand Duke, in 1896, which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. The Gondoliers turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after The Grand Duke, the two men never collaborated again. In 1894 Carte had hired his son Rupert as an assistant. Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and Gilbert with the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy in May 1897.New York Post, 7 January 1948 Throughout the later 1890s, Carte's health was declining, and Mrs. Carte assumed more and more of the responsibilities of running the opera company. She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies. The Savoy's shows during this period received comparatively short runs, including His Majesty (1897), The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (1897), The Beauty Stone (1898) and The Lucky Star (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Sullivan's The Beauty Stone ran for only 50 performances.Rollins and Witts, p. 17 In 1899 the Savoy finally had a new success, with Sullivan and Basil Hood's The Rose of Persia, which ran for 213 performances.Rollins and Witts, p. 18 Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of Sullivan and Hood's The Emerald Isle (1901), for which Edward German completed the score.The Times obituary, 4 April 1901, p. 8 =Early 20th century= Carte left his theatre, opera company and hotels to his wife, who assumed full control of the family businesses.Joseph (1994), p. 133 Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy operas in Britain and overseas.Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–127 She leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet in 1901 and oversaw his management of the company's revival of Iolanthe and the production of several new comic operas, including The Emerald Isle (1901), Merrie England (1902) and A Princess of Kensington (with music by German, libretto by Hood), which ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured.Joseph (1994), p. 138 When A Princess of Kensington closed at the Savoy, Mrs. Carte leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906. The company's fortunes declined for a time, and by 1904 there was only a single touring company wending its way through the British provinces, when it took a seven-month South African tour. In 1906–07 Mrs. Carte staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre, with Gilbert returning to direct.Joseph (1994), p. 146 The season, which included Yeomen, The Gondoliers, Patience and Iolanthe, was a sensation and led to another in 1908–09 including The Mikado, Pinafore, Iolanthe, Pirates, The Gondoliers and Yeomen.Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 83–87 Afterwards, however, Mrs. Carte's health prevented her from staging more London seasons.Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan, Vista Books, London, 1962 She retired and leased the theatre to C. H. Workman, and the company did not perform in London again until 1919, although it continued to tour throughout Britain.Joseph (1994), pp. 138 and 186 Rupert D'Oyly Carte After Gilbert's death in 1911, the company continued to produce productions of the operas in repertory until 1982. In 1911, Helen Carte hired J. M. Gordon as stage manager. Gordon, who was promoted to stage director in 1922,Rollins and Witts, p. ii had been a member of the company and a stage manager under Gilbert's direction, and he fiercely preserved the company's performing traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.Stone, David (ed). J M Gordon at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, accessed 21 December 2009 Except for Ruddigore, which underwent some cuts and received a new overture,Cox and Box was cut and arranged into a short curtain raiser very few changes were made to the text and music of the operas as Gilbert and Sullivan had produced them, and the company stayed true to Gilbert's period settings. Even after Gordon's death, many of Gilbert's directorial concepts survived, both in the stage directions printed in the libretti and as preserved in company prompt books. Original choreography was also maintained.See, for instance, 1882 images of the Act II trio in Iolanthe in Mander and Michenson, p. 65 and 1974 images of the same scene on the sleeve of D'Oyly Carte recording, Decca SKL 5188/9 Some of the company's staging became accepted as traditional by Gilbert and Sullivan fans, and many of these traditional stagings are still imitated today in productions by both amateur and professional companies.Bradley (2005), p. 61\\"Patricia Leonard: principal contralto of the D’Oyly Carte opera\\" . The Times, 22 February 2010 Helen Carte died in 1913, and Carte's son Rupert inherited the company. During World War I, he was away serving in the Royal Navy. According to H. M. Walbrook, \\"Through the years of the Great War [the company] continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere. They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory.\\"Walbrook, H. M. Gilbert & Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment, Chapter XVI (1920) London: F. V. White & Co. Ltd. The company also toured in North America several times, beginning with a Canadian tour in 1927. Rupert D'Oyly Carte found the company's productions increasingly \\"dowdy\\", however, and on his return from the war, he determined to refresh them, bringing in new designers including W. Bridges-Adams for the sets, and, for the costumes, George Sheringham and Hugo Rumbold. He also commissioned new costumes from Percy Anderson who had worked with Gilbert and Richard D'Oyly Carte on the original productions of the later Savoy operas.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 90 Charles Ricketts redesigned sets and costumes for The Mikado (1926) and The Gondoliers (1929). His costumes for The Mikado were retained by all subsequent designers until 1982. In an interview in The Observer in August 1919, Carte set out his policy for staging the operas: \\"They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date.\\"The Observer, 24 August 1919, p. 10 This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, \\"the plays are all being restaged. ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them. Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days.\\" Souvenir programme cover, 1919–20 season The main company made a triumphant return to London for the 1919–20 season at the Prince's Theatre, playing most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in repertory and showing off the new sets and costumes.Information about the 1919–20 D'Oyly Carte season at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 20 November 2009 The success of this season led to additional London seasons in 1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, and 1926; the company toured the rest of the year.Joseph (1994), pp. 160 et seq. Carte's first London season stimulated renewed interest in the operas, and by 1920 he had established a second, smaller company to tour smaller towns. It was disbanded in 1927, although the company often ran multiple tours simultaneously. For London seasons, Carte engaged guest conductors, first Geoffrey Toye, then Malcolm Sargent, who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions. So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error. In a letter to The Times, he noted that \\"the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan.\\"Carte, Rupert D'Oyly. The Times, 22 September 1926, p. 8 Carte also hired Harry Norris, who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director. In 1917 the company made the first complete recording of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado, for the Gramophone Company (later known as His Master's Voice). Rupert D'Oyly Carte supervised the company's recordings, including eight more acoustic recordings by 1924, and a series of electrical recordings (without dialogue) in the late 1920s and early 1930s. There were additional recordings, in high fidelity, for Decca Records, in the late 1940s and early 1950s and stereo recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s, all supervised after Rupert's death by his daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte.Links to detailed descriptions of the various series of D'Oyly Carte recordings . A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 10 January 2010 =The new Savoy Theatre= 1921 cartoon: D'Oyly Carte audiences Rupert D'Oyly Carte also redesigned the Savoy Theatre. On 3 June 1929 the Savoy closed, and it was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by Basil Ionides. The old house had three tiers; the new one had two. The seating capacity was increased from 986 to 1,158. The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929,Savoy Theatre programme note, September 2000 with The Gondoliers, designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent. Sheringham designed new productions that season for H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and Patience (1929, with other designs contributed by Rumbold),Illustrations of the Sheringham designs for Pinafore, Pirates and Patience , the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 17 August 2019 and he later designed costumes for Trial by Jury and Iolanthe.Rollins and Witts, pp. VII–VIII The Savoy also hosted London seasons for the company in 1930–31, 1933, 1941, 1951, 1954, 1961, 1963–64, and 1975. London seasons at other theatres, mostly Sadler's Wells, included summer seasons from 1935 to 1939, 1942, 1947 to 1950, 1953, 1971, 1975, 1977 and 1980; and winter seasons in 1956–57, 1958–59, 1960–61, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1967–68, and then every winter between 1969–70 and 1981–82.In addition to the Savoy and Sadler's Wells, London seasons were at the Prince's Theatre (1956–57, 1958–59, and 1960–61); the Saville Theatre (1963–64, 1965–66 and 1967–68); the Royal Festival Hall (1971 and 1975); and the Adelphi Theatre, 1981–82). See Rollins and Witts, pp. 180–186 and supplements. The company continued to tour the British provinces and abroad when it was not in London, and these tours also often included London suburbs.Rollins and Witts, pp. 154–182 The company's musical director from 1929 (having been assistant musical director from 1925) was Isidore Godfrey, who retained the position until 1968 and guest conducted the company in 1975, as part of the centenary season at the Savoy Theatre. Guest conductors during Godfrey's tenure were Sargent and Boyd Neel. Henry Lytton retired in 1934 after a quarter century as the principal comedian, and the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with its new principal comedian, Martyn Green. In 1938 many company members participated in the Technicolor film of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 128 On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres. Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.Joseph (1994), p. 246 Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September,The Times, 9 September 1939, p. 9 but it took some weeks to re-form the company. Some performers, including Martyn Green, were already committed elsewhere, and Grahame Clifford was engaged to play his roles. The company resumed touring, in Edinburgh, on Christmas Day 1939.Rollins and Witts, p. 164 The company continued to perform throughout the war, both on tour and in London, but in 1940 German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its shows: Cox and Box, The Sorcerer, H.M.S. Pinafore, Princess Ida and Ruddigore. The old productions of Pinafore and Cox and Box were recreated shortly after the war, and Ruddigore received a new production, planned by Carte but not seen until after his death. The other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory. On the other hand, for the first wartime season, Peter Goffin, a protégé of Carte's daughter, Bridget, had designed a new production of The Yeomen of the Guard first seen in January 1940, and his new Ruddigore debuted in 1948. A return to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful, and the company resumed frequent visits to America. Ricketts's 1926 Mikado design Rupert died in 1948, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget.Joseph (1994), pp. 273–274 She soon hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager. Bridget and Lloyd also took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery. Peter Goffin, who had redesigned Yeomen (1939) and Ruddigore (1948) for the company, created new settings and costumes for Bridget for half a dozen more productions: The Mikado (1952; settings only, most of the celebrated Ricketts costumes being retained), Patience (1957), The Gondoliers (1958), Trial by Jury (1959), H.M.S. Pinafore (1961; ladies' costumes) and Iolanthe (1961). A new production of Princess Ida in 1954 was designed by James Wade.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 154 Eleanor Evans, however, was an example of the company's stage directors from 1949 to 1953 who were said to be reluctant to update and freshen stagings.Watt, John. \\"The Ones that I Like\\", Interview with Sandford, c. 1972, at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website In 1957 Goffin designed a unit set for the company to facilitate touring, reducing the number of vans required to carry the scenery from twenty to nine. A 1957 review of Yeomen in The Times praised the production and marvelled at \\"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\\", noting: \\"The opera remains enchanting; the singing seems, on the whole, better and more musical than that which one used to hear, say, 30 years since; and though the acting lacks some of the richly crusted performances of those days, it is perhaps none the worse for that\\".\\"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan\\", The Times, 14 February 1957, p. 5 In 1949 the company began a new series of recordings with Decca, featuring Green, who had returned to the company after the war, and continued the series with his successor, Peter Pratt.Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 151 and 154 The company cooperated with the production of the 1953 film The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan, which used some former members of the company in the cast. In 1955 the company gave a seven-month tour to the U.S. to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its first American productions.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 175 In 1959 the company began the tradition of holding a zany \\"last night\\" on the last evening of each London season. =Later years and closing= With the approaching end of the D'Oyly Carte monopoly on Gilbert and Sullivan performances, when the copyright on Gilbert's words expired in 1961 (Sullivan's music had already come out of copyright at the end of 1950), Bridget D'Oyly Carte contributed the company and all its assets to an independent charitable trust. She endowed the trust with the company's scenery, costumes, band parts and other assets, together with a cash endowment, and supervised the production of operas on behalf of the trust until economic necessity forced the closure of the company in 1982.Bradley (2005), p. 29 As it turned out, competing professional productions of Gilbert and Sullivan did not harm the company.Bradley (2005), p. 38 Beginning in 1959, the company re-recorded most of the operas with Pratt's successor, John Reed, and also recorded a number of other Sullivan pieces. It made a cinema film of The Mikado in 1966, and recorded for television broadcast its productions of Patience (1965) and H.M.S. Pinafore (1973).Shepherd, Mark. \\"The 1966 D'Oyly Carte Mikado Film\\" , \\"The 1973 D'Oyly Carte Pinafore Video\\", and \\"The 1965 D'Oyly Carte Patience Broadcast\\".

All thirteen surviving Gilbert and Sullivan operas were performed in chronological order. Trial by Jury was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates and as an afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before the first of the four performances of Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Richard D'Oyly Carte, Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial by Jury in 1875; afterwards, the prime minister, Harold Wilson, and Bridget D'Oyly Carte each gave a short speech.Forbes, Elizabeth. Kenneth Sandford obituary. The Independent, 23 September 2004 A highlight of the season was a new staging of Utopia Limited (later given again at the Royal Festival Hall), its first revival by the company. The Grand Duke was given as a concert performance, with narration by the BBC presenter Richard Baker. Royston Nash, who was at the company's musical helm from 1971 to 1979, conducted most of the performances, with Isidore Godfrey (Pinafore) and Sir Charles Mackerras (Pirates and Mikado) as guest conductors. Princes Philip and Andrew saw The Gondoliers. In the final performance of Trial by Jury, the regular D'Oyly Carte chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company: Sylvia Cecil, Elsie Griffin, Ivan Menzies, John Dean, Radley Flynn, Elizabeth Nickell-Lean, Ella Halman, Leonard Osborn, Cynthia Morey, Jeffrey Skitch, Alan Barrett, Mary Sansom, Philip Potter and Gillian Humphreys.The Savoyard, Vol. 14, No. 2, September 1975Biographies of all of these performers at the Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company website In 1977, during Queen Elizabeth II's Jubilee Year, the company gave a Royal Command Performance of Pinafore at Windsor Castle. Throughout the 20th century, until 1982, the company toured, on average, for 35 weeks per year (in addition to its 13-week London seasons), fostering a \\"strong family atmosphere, reinforced by the number of marriages in the company and the fact that so many people stayed with it for so long.\\"Bradley (2005), pp. 30–31 The principal soprano Valerie Masterson married the company's principal flautist, Andrew March. She explained, \\"people didn't have flats or houses ... touring was your life.\\"Bradley (2005), p. 31 Throughout its history, the company maintained strict moral standards, and it was sometimes referred to as the \\"Savoy boarding school\\", enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage, and even a dress code.Bradley (2005), pp. 31–34 Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to \\"the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company's direct descent from its creators, Gilbert, Sullivan ... Richard D'Oyly Carte, followed by his widow, Helen, his son Rupert, and finally his granddaughter Bridget.\\"Bradley (2005), p. 52 The company also preserved, for over a century, what The Times called a \\"unique performance style, which may be summarised as a combination of good taste and good fun\\". Planter in front of the Savoy Hotel honouring the Carte family and colleagues The company visited Denmark in 1970, Rome in 1974, and gave its last American tours in 1976 and 1978. Its last tour, in Australasia, conducted by the company's new musical director, Fraser Goulding, was a success in 1979. After the 1979 tour, the rising costs of mounting year-round professional light opera without any government support, despite some generous private contributions, caused the company to accrue increasing losses.Bradley (2005), p. 42 In 1980 the English Arts Council's Music Panel and Touring Committee recommended that the Arts Council make a grant to the company, but this idea was rejected.Bradley (2005), p. 45 The company's fans made an effort to raise private funds, but these were insufficient to make up the accelerating losses. In 1981 the producer George Walker proposed to film the company performing all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas but backed out.Bradley (2005), pp. 49–50 Bridget D'Oyly Carte was forced to close the company in 1982, after a final London season in which Reed and Masterson returned as guest artists.Joseph (1994), p. 358; and Wilson and Lloyd, p. 208 It gave its last performance on 27 February 1982, at the Adelphi Theatre. A three-LP recording of this performance was released, which included songs from all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.Shepherd, Marc. \\"D'Oyly Carte: The Last Night\\".

See also chapters four and six. Revivals of the company Dame Bridget D’Oyly Carte died in 1985, leaving in her will a £1 million legacy to enable the company to be revived. The company secured sponsorship from Sir Michael Bishop, who later became chairman of the board of trustees, the Birmingham City Council and BMI British Midland Airways (of which Bishop is chairman). Richard Condon was appointed the revived company's first general manager, and Bramwell Tovey was its first musical director.Bradley (2005), pp. 53–54 and 63 In succeeding seasons, the company's productions of The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore were nominated for Olivier Awards.Lisle, Nicola. \\"When the wheels came off the Carte\\", Classical Music, 17 February 2007, p. 12 From 1988 to 2003, the company mounted productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London, and it produced several operettas by Offenbach, Lehár and Strauss. Unlike the original company, which had regularly performed up to a dozen operas each year, 48 weeks a year, the new company generally presented only one or two operas in shorter seasons. In the first season, in 1988, the operas played were Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard, both starring Gillian Knight. The company made its debut at the Sunderland Empire Theatre on 29 April 1988, and, after touring, opened in London at the Cambridge Theatre in July.Kelly, Richard. \\"lolanthe\\", The Guardian, 2 May 1988, p. 20; and Canning, Hugh.

It \\"was unveiled to storms of outraged booing\\".Canning, Hugh. \\"Light-arted operatic fare a la Carte – Opera\\".

Some critics, however, thought that it was time to sweep away \\"bad and lazy\\" traditions of the old company, calling the production \\"riotous, zany and subversive ... with a Goonish or Pythonesque sense of slapstick comedy\\", noting that \\"The girls are pretty and the boys are handsome, and they sing and dance with a youthful freshness\\". Also in 1991, the company accepted an offer from the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham, to make its base there, although its pattern of spring national tours and summer London seasons was not affected.Seton, Craig. \\"D'Oyly Carte to move\\".

Some performers appeared in several productions, but each production was cast anew, often with guest stars from British television in leading roles, with varying degrees of success.See, for example, Billington, Michael. \\"The Mikado\\". The Guardian, 2 July 2002, accessed 6 June 2010 The chorus and orchestra of the new company were much smaller than those of the old company: the chorus was reduced from 32 (or more) to 20, and the orchestra from 38 generally to 24.See D'Oyly Carte programme booklets from Sadler's Wells 1977–78 season and the Savoy Theatre 2002 season. For a 1998 production of Pirates at the Queen's Theatre, the orchestra was even smaller: The Guardian wrote, \\"The goings-on in the pit are dispiriting. Budgetary constraints have forced the company to re-write the score for a band of nine instrumentalists. They play well enough, but every one of Sullivan's parodies loses its clout.\\"Ashley, Tim. \\"Tattered and tired Pirates\\", The Guardian, 30 December 1998, p. 2 The company received a modest Arts Council grant in 1997 to keep it afloat and turned to private funding from Raymond Gubbay for London seasons beginning in 1998. Despite the lean forces, the company received generally favourable reviews over the next five years under the management of Ian Martin.Bradley (2005), pp. 63–67 Some of its recordings have been well received.See, for example, Shepherd, Marc. \\"The New D'Oyly Carte Yeomen (1993)\\".

After fifteen years, with no Arts Council funding forthcoming, the company suspended productions in May 2003.Bradley (2005), p. 68 The company was dormant from 2003 to 2012, but it successfully claimed reimbursement of VAT paid during the 1990s, which helped it return to production.Pringle, Matthew. \\"About\\", D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, accessed 10 August 2020 From May to July 2013, Scottish Opera produced a British touring production of The Pirates of Penzance in partnership with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, although it was not reported what role the latter company took in the producing team.

Before Grossmith left the company in 1889, he created the principal comic roles in nine of the operas, and so the principal comedian parts in the operas are often referred to as the \\"Grossmith\\" roles. Other performers who created a long series of roles in the original productions of the operas included the baritone Rutland Barrington, mezzo-soprano Jessie Bond, soprano Leonora Braham, contralto Rosina Brandram, tenor Durward Lely and bass-baritone Richard Temple. In the original New York City productions and British touring productions, the soprano Geraldine Ulmar, baritone Signor Brocolini, comic George Thorne and bass-baritone Fred Billington became particularly well known.Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 19–46 Passmore as Rudolph in The Grand Duke After Grossmith left the company, the most notable players of his roles during the rest of Gilbert's lifetime were Walter Passmore (principal comedian from 1894 to 1903) and Charles H. Workman, who played the roles on tour with the company from 1897 and took over as principal comedian at the Savoy between 1906 and 1909.Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 59–87 Both of these performers made recordings of songs from the Savoy operas. During the Passmore era, principal players of the company included Brandram and Barrington, as well as tenor Robert Evett, soprano Isabel Jay, sopranos Ruth Vincent and Florence St. John, tenor Courtice Pounds and his sister, mezzo- soprano Louie Pounds. During Workman's tenure, principal players included contralto Louie René, soprano Clara Dow, Leo Sheffield, and a young Henry Lytton. No complete recordings of the operas were made that included active members of the company until the 1920s. Workman and W. S. Gilbert quarrelled over their production of Fallen Fairies in 1909, and Gilbert banned Workman from appearing in his works in Britain. It is likely that, otherwise, Workman would have continued as principal comedian of the company.Murray, Roderick. \\"A review of Lytton – Gilbert and Sullivan's Jester by Brian Jones\\" in The Gaiety (Summer, 2006) Rupert D'Oyly Carte wrote to Workman in 1919 asking him to return to the company as principal comedian, but Workman declined.Howarth, Paul. Fallen Fairies cast information at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 19 March 2005, accessed 4 November 2009 From 1909 to 1934, the principal comedian was Henry Lytton, who had been playing a variety of roles with the company steadily since 1887. He received a knighthood for his performances during his long tenure with the company.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 125 Lytton's voice deteriorated during his later career, and when HMV embarked on a series of complete recordings of the operas after World War I, he was not invited to record most of his roles. Instead, the concert singer George Baker was brought in to substitute. Other performers from this period include the mezzo-soprano Nellie Briercliffe, bass-baritone Darrell Fancourt, who is estimated to have portrayed the Mikado of Japan more than 3,000 times, contralto Bertha Lewis, tenor Derek Oldham, soprano Elsie Griffin and baritones Leo Sheffield and Sydney Granville.Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 90–112 Henry Lytton, 1901 Lytton was succeeded in 1934 by Martyn Green, who played the principal comic parts until 1951, except for a gap from the end of 1939 to 1946, when Grahame Clifford replaced him.Rollins and Witts, pp. 164–170 Green's time with the company is remembered for the early Decca recordings of the operas.Rollins and Witts, pp. XIV–XV During Green's tenure, in addition to the long-serving Fancourt, principal players included the baritone Richard Walker, soprano Helen Roberts, mezzo-soprano Marjorie Eyre, baritone Leslie Rands and contralto Ella Halman.Rollins and Witts, pp. 159–163 and 171–175 Green was followed by Peter Pratt.

The American Jacob Snider invented this firearm action, and the Snider–Enfield was one of the most widely used of the Snider varieties. The British Army adopted it in 1866 as a conversion system for its ubiquitous Pattern 1853 Enfield muzzle-loading rifles, and used it until 1874 when the Martini–Henry rifle began to supersede it. The British Indian Army used the Snider–Enfield until the end of the nineteenth century. Design and manufacture (From Left to Right): A .577 Snider cartridge, a Zulu War–era rolled brass foil .577/450 Martini–Henry Cartridge, a later drawn brass .577/450 Martini–Henry cartridge, and a .303 British Mk VII SAA Ball cartridge. In trials, the Snider Pattern 1853 conversions proved both more accurate than the original Pattern 1853s and much faster firing; a trained soldier could fire ten aimed rounds per minute with the breech-loader, compared with only three rounds per minute with the muzzle- loading weapon. From 1866 onwards, the Enfield rifles were converted in large numbers at the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield beginning with the initial pattern, the Mark I. The converted rifles received a new breechblock/receiver assembly, but retained the original iron barrel, furniture, lock, and hammer. The Mark III rifles were newly made. They featured steel barrels which were so marked, flat nosed hammers, and a latch- locking breech block instead of the simple integral block lifting tang. The Snider–Enfield used a new type of metal-cased cartridge called a Boxer cartridge after its designer. The breech block housed a diagonally downward sloping firing pin struck with a front-action lock mounted hammer. To operate the weapon, the rifleman cocked the hammer, flipped the block out of the receiver to the right by grasping the left mounted breech block lever, and then pulled the block back to extract the spent case. There was no ejector, so the firer lifted the case out or, more usually, turned the rifle upside-down to allow the case to drop out. (Perhaps even more usually, the firer then shook the weapon vigorously to dislodge hot cartridges or those fouled by dust or grime.) Service Snider breech-loading mechanism. The Snider first saw action with the British/Indian Army at the battle of Magdala (Aroghee) in Ethiopia on 10 April 1868, against the forces of Tewodros II of Ethiopia; during the battle the 4th (King's Own) Regiment of Foot alone fired 10,200 rounds.Markham, Clements R (1869) A History of the Abyssinian Expedition (Macmillan & Co); p. 325. The Snider–Enfield served throughout the British Empire, including Cape Colony, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, until its gradual phaseout by the Martini–Henry, beginning in 1874. Volunteer and militia forces continued to use it until the late 1880s. It stayed in service with the Indian Army until the mid-1890s, because between the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and 1905 the British kept the Indian Army one weapon generation behind British units. The Hunza Scouts may have been the last to use it in action (in the carbine version), in the Chitral campaign of 1895.Beynon, L. (1895) With Kelly To ChitralThe Indian units received the Martini–Henry when the British adopted the Lee–Metford. The Ijeshas used large numbers of Snider–Enfields against Ibadan during the 16-year-long Yoruba Civil War (1877 to 1893). Frank Richards, who served on the Northwest Frontier between 1902 and 1908, records in Old Soldier Sahib that the British army still used Sniders during that period. Sentries on night duty in camps and cantonments would carry a Snider and buckshot cartridges. Should tribesmen try to get into the camp to steal rifles, the buckshot would give the sentries a better chance of hitting the thief, and unlike a .303 round, would be less likely to wound or kill a comrade should the sentry miss. The Snider was notably powerful. Rudyard Kipling gave a graphic depiction of its effect in his poem, \\"The Grave of the Hundred Head\\": > A Snider squibbed in the jungle— Somebody laughed and fled, And the men of > the First Shikaris Picked up their Subaltern dead, With a big blue mark in > his forehead And the back blown out of his head. Variants New Zealand Military issue, 1881 Snider Mk II .577 calibre artillery carbine The Snider–Enfield was produced in several variants. The most commonly encountered variants were the Rifled Musket or Long Rifle, the Short Rifle, and the Cavalry and Artillery Carbines. The Long Rifle has a barrel and three barrel bands. Its total length (without bayonet) is in length, longer than most rifles of the time. It was issued to line infantry and has three-groove rifling with one turn in . The Short Rifle has a barrel and two barrel bands with iron furniture. This variant was issued to sergeants of line infantry and rifle units. It has five-groove rifling with one turn in . The Cavalry Carbine is half stocked and has only one barrel band. It has a barrel, with the same rifling as the Short Rifle. The Artillery Carbine has a barrel with a full stock and two barrel bands, and the same rifling as the Short Rifle and Cavalry Carbine. The Snider was the subject of substantial imitation, in both approved and questionable forms, including the Nepalese Snider, which was a nearly exact copy, the Dutch Snider, Danish Naval Snider, and the \\"unauthorised\\" adaptations of the French Tabatière and Russian Krnka. There were also \\"Trade Pattern\\" Snider–Enfields, being Snider–Enfields made for private purchase by various English gun-makers. These were often intended for sale to members of volunteer military units, or simply to anyone who might wish to purchase a rifle. Modern usage  Enthusiasts still use these rifles today, with the number in circulation boosted by the acquisition by Atlanta Cutlery and International Military Antiques of a vast quantity of antique weapons held in the Royal Nepalese Armory in the Lagan Silekhana Palace for over a century. Ammunition is reloaded into either modern production .577 Snider cases, or reformed 24 gauge brass shotgun shells. Black powder or modern black powder substitutes are used. The HCRA in Halifax does live fire demonstrations daily in the Halifax Citadel, fire blanks many times a day, while they are also in possession of around 60 of these rifles. In addition, the FHG at Fort Henry also uses the various variants of this weapon for their reenactments.

It is one of two through routes for Interstate 35 through the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the other being Interstate 35W through Minneapolis. Thus, both ends of I-35E are shared with I-35W and I-35. This is one of two pairs of suffixed Interstates that has not been eliminated; I-35 also splits into I-35E and I-35W in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Similar to the Texas split, the Minnesota version of I-35E continues the exit numbers of I-35, while those of I-35W begin with 1 just north of the split. I-35E also carries the legislative route of I-35—unsigned legislative route 390—through the Twin Cities. On the other hand, the portion of I-35E through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul is a controversial four-lane parkway that heavy trucks are prohibited from using. Interstate 35E in Minnesota is in length. Route description The southern terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads north into Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), immediately to the north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN 77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit 92) at Apple Valley – Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit 99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits 94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN 62 (exit 101) and MN 13 (exit 102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN 77 and MN 62, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN 13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic anti- icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather. The new Lexington Bridge, completed in 2004 The auxiliary lanes from MN 13 leave at the first exit in Saint Paul, a half interchange with Shepard Road (exit 103A) with ramps toward the bridge. Shepard Road is a four-lane roadway with minimal intersections that follows the Mississippi River northeast into downtown Saint Paul. Immediately after Shepard Road is MN 5 (West 7th Street) (exit 103B), which leads northeast to downtown through the heart of the West Seventh neighborhood. The portion of I-35E between MN 5 and downtown is a mostly sunken four-lane parkway with a speed limit of (this portion is sometimes referred to as the \\"practice freeway\\" by locals), a ban on trucks over gross vehicle weight, and median landscaping. This parkway was built instead of a typical six-lane freeway because of local opposition. Major interchanges on this section include Ayd Mill Road (exit 104B), a sunken four-lane road to the northwest, and Kellogg Boulevard (exit 106B), which extends in both directions as part of a loop around downtown. The four lanes of I-35E pass through downtown Saint Paul in the center of the six lanes of I-94/US 52, with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E—exit 107A from I-35E north to I-94 east/US 52 South, and exit 107B from I-35E south to I-94 west/US 52 north—takes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap instead to the right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges on the common segment, and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 west/US 52 north or I-94 eastbound/US 52 southbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94/US 52 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94/US 52, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east/ US 52 north and I-94 westbound/US 52 northbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway 10 (US 10), which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, and truck traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway (US 52) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood. From downtown Saint Paul north to the junction with I-694 west (exit 113) in Little Canada, where US 10 also leaves I-35E, the highway carries three lanes of traffic in each direction, in addition to a single MnPASS HOV lane. Major interchanges here include Cayuga Street (exit 108), and MN 36 (exit 111). An overlap of about one mile (1.5 km) exists between the two interchanges with I-694 (exits 113 and 114). Heading northbound on I-35E, the four lanes split into three for I-35E northbound and two for I-694 westbound, and then three lanes from I-694 eastbound enter on the right. These six lanes then split into three on the left for I-35E northbound and three on the right for I-694 eastbound; after the turn north, a lane joins on the right from I-694 westbound traffic. The configuration in the other direction, where I-35E southbound and I-694 westbound merge, is similar, but with only five total lanes instead of six where the freeways overlap. A four-year construction project, called \\"Unweave the Weave\\" beginning in 2004, was completed in 2008, and eliminated weaving where previously three I-35E lanes were inside three I-694 lanes, and left lane onramps existed. I-35E is four lanes wide north of I-694; the third lane added northbound from the I-694 westbound ramp exits immediately onto County Road E (exit 115) in Vadnais Heights. Other than the northern terminus of I-35E (exit 127) in Columbus near Forest Lake, where it merges with I-35W to re-form I-35, there are only four interchanges on I-35E north of I-694 between Vadnais Heights and Columbus, all for county roads. History 1955 plan for I-35E and other Twin Cities Area Interstates Early plans for the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same alignment as the present I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South of the Twin Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of old US 65, which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel to MN 13, which cut northeast to Saint Paul from old US 65 south of the Minnesota River. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 closely paralleled US 61, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled old US 8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton and then to the present day I-35E–I-35W split at Columbus near Forest Lake, near where old US 8 had joined US 61. The Minnesota Legislature defined I-35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route 390, which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I-35. I-35E was completed north of downtown Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint Paul to I-694 in Little Canada; this was completed in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN 49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both directions *Control Section 6282: I-94 west of I-35E (PDF) *Control Section 6283: I-94 east of I-35E (PDF)). In 1970, I-35E was extended north along the I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada – Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened at about the same time. *Control Section 0280: I-35W south of I-35E (PDF) *Control Section 0283: I-35 north of I-35E (PDF *Control Section 6286: I-694 east of I-35E (PDF) *Control Section 1982 (PDF) *Control Section 6280 (PDF) *Control Section 6281 (PDF) *Control Section 0282: I-35E from south to north (PDF) The southern half of I-35E in the metro area took a lot longer to build. Its first section—a short stretch from MN 110 north to State Highway 5, including the Lexington Bridge over the Mississippi River—opened in the mid-1960s. *Control Section 1980: I-35 south of I-35E (PDF) *Control Section 1981: I-35W north of I-35E (PDF) Even though the connecting piece of I-35W and I-35 at the southern terminus of I-35E in Burnsville opened in the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that I-35E was completed south of MN 110 at Mendota Heights and southbound through Eagan and Apple Valley, where there had been a missing link of I-35E for 20 years. Construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in Burnsville and from environmentalists over the proposed alignment across Blackhawk Lake. The final plan involved a new alignment avoiding the lake, as well as a less complicated interchange at I-494 in Mendota Heights, eliminating access to MN 55 that was part of the earlier plans. =Controversy through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul= The St. Peter Street bridge over the I-94 overlap The missing piece through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul, from MN 5 (West 7th Street) northeast to I-94 in downtown Saint Paul, was held up by controversy. Construction began in 1964, and was planned for completion in the 1970s as a typical six-lane freeway, but in late 1969, a group of neighbors in the area had formed \\"Residents in Protest 35E\\" (R.I.P. 35E) to oppose the completion of I-35E. The group convinced the city to drop its support, and in August it filed a joint lawsuit against the Minnesota Highway Department (MHD) and U.S. Department of Transportation along with four neighborhood associations and eight citizens. The parties quickly reached an agreement, favorable to the plaintiffs, to halt construction pending an environmental impact statement (EIS). The Saint Paul City Council decided in late 1974 to support I-35E, possibly due to the influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to go along with it. The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying noise pollution, air pollution, vibrations, and slope stability as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street. A bill passed by the Minnesota Legislature on May 31, 1975, imposed a moratorium on building I-35E, as well as other area freeways such as the canceled I-335 project and the MN 55 (Hiawatha Avenue) upgrade project. This law defined several new legislative routes, which \\"may be added by order of the commissioner of transportation to the trunk highway system\\" (as opposed to other such routes, which were added to that system by the legislature): > Legislative Route No. 380\\\\. Beginning at a point on Route No. 390 [I-35E] at > its intersection with Shepard Road in the city of Saint Paul; thence > extending in a northeasterly direction generally following along the course > of Shepard Road to a point on Route No. 112 [Lafayette Freeway]; thence > extending in a northeasterly direction to a point on Route No. 392 [I-94] > easterly of the downtown area of Saint Paul; providing a connector route > between Route No. 390 and Routes No. 112 and 392; > Legislative Route No. 381\\\\. Beginning at a point on Route No. 112 [Lafayette > Freeway], northerly of the Lafayette Street bridge in the city of Saint > Paul; thence extending in a northwesterly direction to a point on Route No. > 390 [I-35E], southerly of Maryland Avenue in the city of Saint Paul; > providing a connector route between Route No. 112 and Route No. 390; and > Legislative Route No. 382\\\\. Beginning at a point on Route No. 390 [I-35E] at > its junction with Route No. 111 [MN 5], thence extending in a general > northerly direction, within the corridor of the right of way already > acquired on the effective date of this act, for Route No. 390, to a point on > Short Line Road; thence extending in a northeasterly direction within said > corridor of right of way to the intersection of Pleasant Avenue and Kellogg > Boulevard in the city of Saint Paul. The parkway at Ramsey StreetLegislative Routes 380 and 381 provided for an alternate alignment of I-35E along Shepard Road and a northerly extension of the Lafayette Freeway, while Legislative Route 382 was a \\"four-lane parkway facility\\" that the MHD could build along the original alignment of I-35E, but without a connection to I-94. The city announced its support of the parkway in August 1976. An act passed on April 5, 1978, added a condition to the definition of Legislative Route 390 (I-35E): > Legislative Route No. 390 [I-35E] shall not include any portion of > Legislative Route No. 382 [the parkway] as designated by section 161.117 or > any portion of any route connecting Route No. 382 to Route No. 392 [I-94], > nor shall it include any portion of trunk highway marked number 3 from trunk > highway marked number 110 in Dakota County to East Seventh Street in the > city of Saint Paul. At the time, old MN 3 was marked along the nearby Lafayette Freeway (now US 52) from the late 1970s to 1994. It also allowed a connection from the parkway to I-94, but this link could not be controlled access. The Metropolitan Council was to complete a draft EIS for the parkway and I-35E by September 1, 1979, with the cooperation of Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) and Saint Paul. There was widespread support for a parkway, with landscaping and a truck restriction, but the non-connection to I-94 jeopardized federal Interstate funding, since it could no longer be part of the continuous I-35E. Two notable alternatives came out of the draft EIS—a parkway with or without an I-94 connection. The parkway with a connection would provide the same level of service as a typical freeway. R.I.P. 35E and other citizens' groups continued to oppose a direct connection, arguing that it would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers would be more likely to exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with MnDOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route 390 (I-35E) to use Route 382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983. The suit alleged that the EIS focused almost exclusively on the Pleasant Avenue alignment, and that it did not consider the effect of a direct connection on speed limit compliance; faster traffic would mean more noise. Judge Paul Magnuson ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid, stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals. This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract, prohibiting the state from raising the speed limit or allowing trucks. Construction went forward, and I-35E was opened from MN 5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984, using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction. Further extensions, including all new bridges, were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986, to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988, and to I-94 on October 15, 1990, 26 years after construction began. The 1990 opening ceremony of I-35E in downtown Saint Paul was attended by a group of highway experts from the Soviet Union, and both the US and Soviet national anthems were played. =Later changes= The original plans for the I-94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul did not include the right-side ramps that eliminate weaving. The ramp from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway (US 52) to avoid weaving across I-94 east. This project was done because the old Spaghetti Junction at the east split of I-35E and I-94 would not be able to handle the extra load from the completed I-35E parkway. When the first piece of the parkway opened in 1984, unused provisions, pending more study, were added for a direct link to Ayd Mill Road, a sunken four-lane road with minimal intersections that leads northwest from I-35E. The ramps were built and temporarily opened in 1992 for high-occupancy vehicles, due to the closure of the nearby Lafayette Bridge (US 52) for reconstruction. The ramps were reopened on June 12, 2002, as a test, and remain open . A controversial extension of Ayd Mill Road to I-94 remains on the table. The 1964 Lexington Bridge across the Mississippi River was replaced by a new bridge, built from 2001 to 2004, due to deterioration of the old structure including cracks in steel beams. Unweave the Weave, a project to eliminate weaving at the I-694 overlap, was completed in 2008. The 1965 bridge just north of downtown Saint Paul carrying a daily traffic volume of 148,000 vehicles over Cayuga Street and the BNSF Railway line was rated by MnDOT as meeting minimum tolerable limits in 2006. Its superstructure and substructure were described as poor with advanced section loss, deterioration, spalling, or scour. As the fourth busiest bridge in the state, it was scrutinized following the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in nearby Minneapolis on August 1, 2007. The bridge was replaced in a construction project that finished in late 2016. Exit list Exit numbers and mileposts increase numerically from the south end, continuing the numbers used on I-35.

Valentina Mikhaylovna Leontyeva (; 1 August 1923 in Petrograd – 20 May 2007 in Ulyanovsk) was a famous anchor on Soviet TV. She was one of the first television presenters in the Soviet Union. Leontyeva survived the Siege of Leningrad, which claimed the life of her father. After a brief stint at the Mendeleyev Institute, she attended the Vakhtangov Theatre School in Moscow. In 1948, she joined a theatre in Tambov. As a TV anchor, she became famous for her deeply felt manner of presentation. Among her most popular shows was \\"Ot Vsei Dushi\\" (\\"From the Bottom of My Heart\\"), which has been praised for its honesty and emotional depth. She toured 54 cities of the Soviet Union with a stage version of the show. She was also the host of the Goluboy ogonyok (\\"Blue Light\\"), a New Year's Eve variety show, and Spokoinoi Nochi, Malyshi (\\"Good Night, Little Ones\\"), a daily program for children. In 1975, Leontyeva was awarded the USSR State Prize. In the 1980s, she hosted Visit to Fairy Tales, a children's show, and became popularly known as simply \\"Aunt Valya\\" (). Her popularity led to her being awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR (1982), the highest honor that could be bestowed on a television presenter. On 12 March 2004 the Federation Council of Russia presented to her the medal \\"For Contributions\\", revived from the 19th century.

Life Geraldo Ribeiro de Sousa Resende was born in Rio de Janeiro, on 19 April 1847, to the aristocratic and military family of the Marquis and Marquess of Valença. He studied in Paris, France. His mother's family had acquired the farm of Santa Genebra, in Campinas, and after her death, young Geraldo de Resende decided to settle there in 1870. The farm was semi-ruined and worthless, but with characteristic vigor and entrepreneurship, he transformed and expanded it into one of the most productive farms of the region, with extensive sugarcane and coffee plantations. The Baron was known for his modernity regarding the use of new methods and machinery in agriculture and was one of the founders of the Club da Lavoura in 1878, a club of wealthy and progressive farmers. In 1876 he married D. Maria Amélia Barbosa de Oliveira. Inevitably, the Club became politically influential soon after, and many of its members involved themselves in local and state conservative politics, so Barão Geraldo of Resende was no exception. He was elected councilman from 1883 to 1886, president of the local chapter of the pro- monarchic Conservative Party, and state congressman by the 7th District of São Paulo in 1886. On 20 January 1889 he was awarded by royal decree the title of Baron of Iporanga. By his own request, the title was changed by another decree dated 19 June of the same year to \\"Baron Geraldo of Resende\\".Barão Geraldo Masonic Lodge: Barão Geraldo de Rezende Like many of his colleagues he bitterly abandoned politics after the fall of the monarchy in 1889 and returned to his farm. Unfortunately, an economic crisis created many financial difficulties for the Baron, who had no other means of support, and he had to sell the Santa Genebra farm, dying just before it, on 1 October 1907. Legacy The region in and around part of the Santa Genebra farm became a subdistrict of the city of Campinas, which was named in his honour (Barão Geraldo), and where the large campus of the State University of Campinas is now located. Part of the farm was purchased by the Oliveira family, who preserved some of the natural forest. In 1981 it was donated to the municipality of Campinas, and in 1985 became an area of relevant ecological interest named the Mata de Santa Genebra and jointly administered by the city and the Federal ICMBio agency.

Private ownership  Modern navigation moved shipping lanes away from the island and the light, and farther out into Lake Superior.Wobser, David, \\"Granite Island Light,\\" at Boatnerd.com. This tended to make the Coast Guard view it as \\"surplus,\\" and it was put up for private sale. The sale in fact helped precipitate a later reaction by the U.S. Congress, which enacted a preference for selling such facilities to communities and charitable organizations under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000, which was sponsored by Michigan Senator Carl Levin and passed in 2000. Nevertheless, privatization advocates such as the Mackinac Center for Public Policy have praised the island's sale and its results. Granite Island and the lighthouse were purchased by Scott and Martine Holman in 1999 from the U.S. Coast Guard. The facilities underwent a three-year restoration process. The house was completely gutted and rebuilt, with waste being boated out and materials bought in. This is a challenging place to reach and live upon - they have to transport all of their water in, for example; composting toilets must be used, so not many visitors are welcomed.

Although situated on the Dnieper River and presently concentrated on river ships, the company is able to produce & repair small sea vessels (both civil and naval), as well as various military equipment. The Kuznya na Rybalskomu was indirectly controlled by Ukrainian businessman and politician Petro Poroshenko and politician Ihor Kononenko as of 2017. In 2018, the company was bought by Serhiy Tihipko for $300 million. Main production facilities of the company are situated on the Rybalskyi Island in Kyiv since 1928.Kuznya Plant On Rybalsky Co The shipyard specializes in shipbuilding, ship machines building, and propeller production.Bart Finzel and Jelena Kmezic, Privatization of Ukrainian Shipyards (2002), Catholic University of Brussels, 11th Conference of the International Association for the Economics of Participation (IAFEP) In the field of shipbuilding, the plant specializes in building medium fishing vessels, industrial ships and vessels of technical fleet, self-propelled and non-self-propelled barges. Machine building includes steam and hot-water automated boiler units, plate freezing apparatuses, and incinerators. Propeller production includes controllable-pitch propeller (CPP), blades, and lines of shafting.  History  It was founded in 1862 by production engineer Fyodor Gregorevich Donat as a Joint Stock Company in the Russian Empire. It was mainly a mechanical plant and made different metal structures. For a short period of time (1889-1924), the plant was named \\"Kiev Machine-Building Plant\\" and in 1924, it was renamed to Leninska Kuznia. In 1928, by the Decree of Supreme Soviet Union Leninska Kuznia was made into a shipyard. During the Soviet period the LK shipyard also was known as the Ship- building Factory SSZ #302. In 1995, the company completed a change in ownership and open-type joint Stock Company was set up named Leninska Kuznia Plant. The machine building sector still constitutes a high percentage in general scope of production. In 2017 the plant changed its name to Kuznya na Rybalskomu (the Smithy on the Fishers' [Island]). = After 2014 = On January 30, 2015, it was announced that the plant had started producing of two new armored vehicles: Tryton (literally Newt) and Arbalet (literally Crossbow) in accordance to NATO standards.

The structural system transfers loads through interconnected elements or members. Commonly used structures can be classified into five major categories, depending on the type of primary stress that may arise in the members of the structures under major design loads. However any two or more of the basic structural types described in the following may be combined in a single structure, such as a building or a bridge in order to meet the structure's functional requirements.Kassimali, A. (1999). Structural analysis. 2nd edition. Pacific Grove, C.A.: PWS Pub *Tensile structures: Members of tensile structures are subject to pure tension under the action of external loads. Because the tensile stress is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area of members, the material of such a structure is utilized in the most efficient manner. *Compressive structures: Compression structures develop mainly compressive stresses under the action of axial loads. Because compressive structures are susceptible to buckling or instability, the possibility of these failures should be considered in their design. If necessary, adequate bracing must be provided to avoid such failures. *Trusses: Trusses are composed of straight members connected at their ends by hinged connections to form a stable configuration. Because of their light weight and high strength, they are among the most commonly used types of structure. *Shear structures: These are structures such as reinforced concrete or wooden shear walls, which are used in multistory buildings to reduce lateral movements due to wind loads and earthquake excitations. Shear structures develop mainly in-plane shear with relatively small bending stresses under the action of external loads. *Bending structures: Bending structures develop mainly bending stresses under the action of external loads. The shear stresses associated with the changes in bending moments may also be significant, and should be considered in their design. High-rise buildings The structural system of a high-rise building is designed to cope with vertical gravity loads as well as lateral loads caused by wind or seismic activity. The structural system consists only of the members designed to carry the loads, and all other members are referred to as non-structural. A classification for the structural system of a high-rise was introduced in 1969 by Fazlur Khan and was extended to incorporate interior and exterior structures. The primary lateral load- resisting system defines if a structural system is an interior or exterior one. The following interior structures are possible: *Hinged frame *Rigid frame *Braced frame and Shear-walled frame *Outrigger structures (supporting overhangs) The following exterior structures are possible: *Buttresses *Diagrid *Exoskeleton *Space truss *Superframe *Tube (structure) See also *Base isolation *Body-on-frame (automotive) *Double wishbone suspension (automotive) *MacPherson strut (automotive) *Monocoque (automotive) *Space frame *Staggered truss system *Superleggera (automotive) References External links *List of structural framing systems on Phorio Standards ","title":"Structural system"},{"id":"3647768","text":"Sanjukta Panigrahi (24 August 1944 – 24 June 1997)Sanjukta at odissivilas was a dancer from India, who was the foremost exponent of Indian classical dance Odissi. Sanjukta was the first Odia woman to embrace this ancient classical dance at an early age and ensure its grand revival.Sanjukta Panigrahi, Indian Dancer, 65 New York Times, 6 July 1997. In recognition of her contribution to dancing and associated activities, she was honoured with one of India's highest civilian awards the, Padma Shri (1975). She is also recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1976. Apart from presenting Odissi performances in different parts of India, Sanjukta Panigrahi has been a part of Government's cultural delegation to different countries, including to the US and the Philippines (1969), United Kingdom (1983), Israel, Delphi International Festival in Greece (1989). She has also performed in France for eleven weeks, and participated there in the International Music Festival at Paris. Early life and background Panigrahi was born in Berhampur, Ganjam District, Odisha state, to a traditional Brahmin family of Abhiram Mishra and Shakuntala Mishra. When she was a small child, she would start dancing intuitively to any rhythmic sound like the sound of chopping of vegetable or cutting of firewood. Her mother was from Baripada and belonged to a family, which had been patronising chhau folk dance for long. She recognised the talent in her daughter, and encouraged her despite some initial resistance from Abhiram Misra, Sanjukta's father. The reason for the resistance was the fact that in those days this form of dance was performed generally by temple dancing girls, called Maharis. Male dancers are called Gotipuas. These girls were like Devadasis in the temples of South India. Training At the initiative of her mother, she started to learn dance from Kelucharan Mohapatra at age of four. She was assessed to be the best child artist by the Bisuba Milan consecutively for three years during 1950–1953. In one of her performances as six-year-old girl, she refused to leave the stage and continued to perform energetically even after the time was over. Her mother had to shout at and cajole her to stop dancing. At nine, she performed at annual festival of the Children's Little Theatre in Calcutta.Sanjukta Panugrahi mapsofindia. She won the first prize in International Children's Film Festival in 1952. Encouraged by her success, her parents decided to send her for better dance training, to Kalakshetra at Chennai. There she continued her lessons under the guidance of Rukmini Devi Arundale. For the next six years she stayed there, and eventually graduated with a Nrityapraveen diploma in Bharatnatyam with Kathakali as the second subject. After that, she toured many places in India and abroad, as a member of the 'Kalakshetra Ballet Troupe'. At the age of 14, she returned to Odisha. The state government awarded her a scholarship to learn Kathak from Guru Hazarilal in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. However, she left the course and returned to Odisha to concentrate on Odissi. Career The initial years were very challenging for the Sanjukta and her husband, more in terms of eking out a living than anything else. Though things turned for the better, when in 1966, her guru Kelucharan Mahapatra was conferred with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, and she rendered an Odissi performance during the award ceremony in New Delhi. The audience was enthralled by her performance. She had made her mark at the national level, and from that point she did not look back. Meanwhile, her husband had emerged as a fine vocalist, and also started rendering music for her performances. In the coming decades, the Sanjukta-Raghunath duo enthralled the audience, even outlasting the Yamini-Jyothismathi duo, and were jointly awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1976. Sanjukta later came to be known as Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra's greatest disciple, and they travelled the length and the breath of the India, performing together and popularising the almost lost dance form of Odissi, so much so that today, both are considered equal revivalists of the dance form.Kelucharan Mahapatra profile Dance style Sanjukta Panigrahi spent some time at the International School of Theatre Anthropology at Bologna, Italy in 1986, 1990 and 1992, teaching short courses and demonstrating Odissi dance to foreign students, further adding to its global popularity. International School of Theatre Anthropology Sanjukta's forte was her Nritta, or pure dance, in which she was outstanding. Her great advantage was her musician husband, whose constant presence helped her finesse her abilities in this genre. In Abhinaya (interpretation of poetry), connoisseurs and critics were agreed on the fact that she more often than not veered towards jatra and melodrama. Together with her musician husband, Sanjukta has left behind a rich repertoire of Odissi dance, both modern as well as classical, ranging from traditional numbers based on the Jayadeva's Gita Govinda to the padabalies of Surdas, Chaupais from the Ramacharitamanasa of Tulasidas and the songs of Vidyapati and Rabindranath Tagore, with piece-de-resistance being, the innovative Yugma-Dwandwa: a sort of Jugalbandi between the dancer and the musician in Raga Bageshwari, composed by Pandit Damodar Hota, of Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya, and a disciple of Pandit Omkar Nath Thakur, and the sublime, Moksha Mangalam which in time had become her personal signature, which she used to end her performances, on an ethereal note.Odissi Dance , Government of Orissa. In the words of noted dance critic, Dr. Sunil Kothari, \\"Sanjukta gave up Bharatnatyam and devoted her life to Odissi, putting her signature on the form.\\"Obituary by Dr. Sunil Kothari  Later years  She continued to perform in most of the state functions. With her pioneering efforts, she brought forth an almost forgotten Odissi style of dancing to an important position in the dance repertory of India. She died of cancer at the age of 52, on 24 June 1997. Personal life At Kalakshetra, Chennai, she had fallen in love with Raghunath Panigrahi, ten-year her senior, and a fine vocalist of Gita Govinda, who left a promising career in film music in Chennai, to provide vocal support in her performances.Odissi at the crossroads The Hindu, 13 May 2007. When she was 16 years of age, they got married and over a period of time had two sons. Legacy Sanjukta left behind many accomplished students, including Dr. Chitra Krishnamurti, director of Nrityalaya (an Odissi school in Potomac) and Joyoti Das a resident of Melbourne, a devout disciple of her in Australia, the artistic director and teacher of Kalamandir School of Indian classical dances, dedicated to maintain the continuum of Sanjukta's Odissi style. Sanjukta Panigrahi is considered an embodiment of Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra's art. = Sanjukta Panigrahi Awards = After her death, her husband Raghunath Panigrahi formed a trust in her name, 'Sanjukta Panigrahi Memorial Trust', in 1999, to promote the cause of Odissi dance.

The remains are named after Croghan Hill, north of Daingean, County Offaly, near where the body was found. The find is on display in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. Old Croghan Man was found three months after a similar find, dubbed Clonycavan Man, in County Meath. Life The man is calculated (based on his arm span) to have stood approximately tall: which is considered to be exceptionally tall for the period when he lived. The man's apparently manicured nails led to speculation that he was not someone who engaged in manual labour, and possibly therefore of high status. His last meal (analysed from the contents in his stomach) was believed to have been wheat and buttermilk. However, he was shown to have had a meat rich diet for at least the 4 months prior to his death. Scars on his lungs suggest he may have suffered from pleurisy. Death Old Croghan Man is believed to have died between 362 BC and 175 BC, making the body over 2,000 years old. Evidence indicates that the man was in his early twenties when he was killed. The body was naked except for a plaited leather band around his left arm. This likely indicated high status. The man was buried at a bog (likely once a lake) at the foot of an ancient hill that was used for kingship ceremonies. A 2014 documentary suggested that the man was once a king and was sacrificed by druids due to poor weather or harvests. These ancient tribes may have believed that this was caused by the failure of the king and he was responsible. The man is believed to have died from a stab wound to the chest. He had been decapitated and had his body cut in half. He also has an injury to one arm, possible evidence that he tried to defend himself. A similar wound has been seen on the Cashel Man, who was found in 2011, also in Ireland. The body was found to have deep cuts under each nipple. Several theories have been suggested to explain this, including that the damage was caused (after death) by conditions in the bog, that the cuts were indicative of torture while the man was alive, or that the nipples were deliberately mutilated (either before or after death) for symbolic purposes. The latter theory, put forward by Eamonn Kelly of the National Museum of Ireland, suggests that the mutilation was a symbolic gesture to mark the man as a rejected ruler. Other theories suggest that Old Croghan Man and other bog bodies were sacrifices to gods of fertility or harvest, and killed and buried to ensure good yields of cereals and milk. Arm-ring The arm-ring found with the body was made from waterlogged leather, strands of fibres and four bronze mounts. According to Louise Mumford of the National Museum, the leather ring was made with two strands of leather joined together through numerous small slits. The ring was initially removed from the body and wet cleaned to remove elements like peat from the leather. To prevent further decay of the waterlogged leather work and mould growth the arm-ring was stored in a 20% solution of glycerol and de- ionised water for two weeks in a process called consolidation. After drying and further chemical cleaning and treatment to prevent corrosion, the arm-ring was returned to the body for display. Related mythology Croghan Hill is known as Bri Eile in Irish myth. In \\"The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn\\", we are told \\"At that time there was a very beautiful maiden in Bri Ele, that is to say, in the fairy-knoll of Bri Ele, and the name of that maiden was Ele. The men of Ireland were at feud about that maiden. One man after another went to woo her. Every year on Samain the wooing used to take place; for the fairy-mounds of Ireland were always open about Samain; for on Samain nothing could ever be hidden in the fairy-mounds. To each man that went to woo her this used to happen: one of his people was slain.

Supported by the Polish Army, the uprising aimed to throw off control by the Russian Empire of the Polish capital city (Warsaw). It began on 17 April 1794, soon after Tadeusz Kościuszko's victory at the Battle of Racławice. Although the Russian forces had more soldiers and better equipment, the Polish regular forces and militia, armed with rifles and sabres from the Warsaw Arsenal, inflicted heavy losses on the surprised enemy garrison. Russian soldiers found themselves under crossfire from all sides and from buildings, and several units broke early and suffered heavy casualties in their retreat. Kościuszko's envoy, Tomasz Maruszewski, and Ignacy Działyński and others had been laying the groundwork for the uprising since early 1793. They succeeded in winning popular support: the majority of Polish units stationed in Warsaw joined the ranks of the uprising. A National Militia was formed by several thousand volunteers, led by Jan Kiliński, a master shoemaker. Within hours, the fighting had spread from a single street at the western outskirts of Warsaw's Old Town to the entire city. Part of the Russian garrison was able to retreat to Powązki under the cover of Prussian cavalry, but most of it was trapped inside the city. The isolated Russian forces resisted in several areas for two more days.  Prelude  Following the Second Partition of Poland of 1793, the presence of Prussian and Imperial Russian garrisons on Polish soil was almost continuous. The foreign occupation forces contributed both to the economic collapse of the already-weakened state and to the growing radicalisation of the population of Warsaw. Foreign influence at the Polish court, often embodied by Russian ambassador Nikolai Repnin, had been strong for many years; during the partitions of Poland it started to influence the Polish government and szlachta (nobility), and the entire people. After losing the Polish–Russian War of 1792, the Permanent Council was pressured by Russia to enact an army reform, in which the Polish Army was reduced by half, and the demobilised soldiers conscripted into the Russian and Prussian armies. This move was secretly opposed by many officers and the arms and supplies of disbanded units were stored in warehouses in Warsaw. Upon receiving news of Kościuszko's proclamation in Kraków (24 March) and his subsequent victory at Racławice (4 April), tension in Warsaw grew rapidly. Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski was opposed to Kościuszko's uprising, and with the Permanent Council issued a declaration condemning it on 2 April. The King dispatched Piotr Ożarowski, who as Grand Hetman of the Crown was the second- highest military commander after the king, and the Marshal of the Permanent Council, Józef Ankwicz, to Iosif Igelström, Russian ambassador and commander of all Russian occupation forces in Poland, with a proposal to evacuate both the Russian troops and Polish troops loyal to the King to a military encampment at Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki. General Stanisław Mokronowski Igelström rejected the plan and saw no need for the Russians to evacuate Warsaw. He sent a corps under General Aleksandr Khrushchev to intercept Kościuszko and prevent him from approaching Warsaw. He also ordered increased surveillance of suspected supporters of the uprising, and imposed censorship all mail passing through Warsaw. Igelström issued orders for the arrest of those he suspected of having any connection with the insurrection. These included some of the more prominent political leaders, among them Generals Antoni Madaliński, Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha and Ignacy Działyński, King's Chamberlain Jan Walenty Węgierski, Marshal of the Sejm Stanisław Małachowski, Ignacy and Stanisław Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj. At the same time Russian forces started preparations to disarm the weak Polish garrison of Warsaw under General Stanisław Mokronowski by seizing the Warsaw Arsenal at Miodowa Street. These orders only made the situation worse as they were leaked to the Poles. The Russian forces prepared a plan to seize the most important buildings to secure the city until reinforcements arrived from Russia. General Johann Jakob Pistor suggested that the barracks of \\"unsafe\\" Polish units be surrounded and the units disarmed, and the Warsaw Arsenal captured to prevent the revolutionaries from seizing arms. At the same time bishop Józef Kossakowski, known for his pro-Russian stance, suggested that the churches be surrounded on Holy Saturday on 19 April with troops and all suspects attending the mass be arrested. Centre of Warsaw as seen on an 1831 map On the Polish side, weakened by the arrests of some of its leaders, both the radical Polish Jacobins and the centrist supporters of King Stanisław August Poniatowski began preparing plans for an all-out attack on the Russian forces to drive them from Warsaw, which was still in theory the capital of an independent state. Kościuszko already had supporters in Warsaw, including Tomasz Maruszewski, his envoy who was sent to Warsaw with a mission to prepare the uprising. Maruszewski created the Revolution Association (Związek Rewolucyjny), organizing the previously independent anti-Russian factions. The Association included among its members various high-ranking officers from the Polish forces stationed in Warsaw. Among them were Michał Chomentowski, Gen. Krystian Godfryd Deybel de Hammerau, Major Józef Górski, Capt. Stanisław Kosmowski, Fryderyk Melfort, Dionizy Poniatowski, Lt. Grzegorz Ropp and Józef Zeydlitz. Among the most influential partisans of the uprising was General Jan August Cichowski, the military commander of the Warsaw's garrison. He and General Stepan Stepanovich Apraksin devised a plan to defend the city against the revolutionaries, and convinced the Russians to leave the Arsenal, the Royal Castle and the Gunpowder Depot defended by the Polish units. Cichowski also undermined the Russian plan to reduce the number of soldiers serving in the Polish units, which also added to the later Polish successes. Also, a prominent burgher, shoemaking master Jan Kiliński, started gathering support from other townsfolk. The King remained passive, and subsequent events unfolded without any support — or opposition — from him. = Opposing forces = As a large part of the Polish forces consisted of irregular militia or regular units in various stages of demobilisation, the exact number of the troops fighting on the Polish side is difficult to estimate. Pay rolls of the Russian garrison have been preserved, which give a fairly accurate number of regular soldiers available to Igelström. The Polish regular forces consisted of 3000 men at arms and 150 horses. The largest Polish unit was the Foot Guard of the Polish Crown Regiment with 950 men at arms. The regiment was stationed in its barracks in Żoliborz, away from the city centre, but it was also responsible for guarding the Royal Castle and some of the strategically important buildings. The 10th Regiment of Foot was to be reduced to 600 men, but in April 1794 could still muster some 850 soldiers. In addition, two companies of the reduced Fusilier Regiment were stationed in the vicinity of the Arsenal and still had 248 soldiers. The Polish forces included a variety of smaller units in various stages of demobilisation, among them the 4th Regiment of Front Guard, 331 men of the 5th Cavalry Regiment and 364 men of the once-powerful Horse Guard of the Polish Crown Regiment. In the eastern borough of Praga there were 680 men and 337 horses of the royal uhlan squadrons and the Engineering Battalion (\\"pontonniers\\"). The latter units crossed the Vistula and took part in the fighting, but served as standard infantry as their horses had to be left on the other side of the river. Kazimierz Bartoszewicz in his monograph of the Uprising assesses that the number of townspeople serving in various irregular militia forces did not exceed 3000, and probably totalled between 1500 and 2000. Many of them were demobilised veterans of regular Polish units who followed their units to Warsaw. The Russian garrison of Warsaw had a nominal strength of 11,750 men, including 1500 cavalrymen, at least 1000 artillerymen with 39 guns and an unspecified number of Cossacks. Due to widespread corruption among Russian officers, Russian infantry battalions rarely had more than 500 men at arms instead of the nominal strength of 960. According to the Russian payroll found after the uprising in the Russian embassy and published soon after in the Gazeta Wolna Warszawska newspaper, the Russian garrison had 7,948 men, 1,041 horses and 34 guns. Most of them were soldiers of the Siberian and Kiev Grenadier Regiments. In addition, Igelström could request assistance from a Prussian unit of General Friedrich von Wölcky stationed west of the city in the fields between Powązki and Marymont. The latter unit had 1,500 men and 4 guns. Although the Russian force was more numerous than the Polish units left in the city after the Polish–Russian War of 1792, Russian soldiers were dispersed all around the city, guarding numerous warehouses or manning outposts in front of residences of their officers. In addition, their orders in case of an armed uprising were often contradictory and did not take into account the possibility of fighting against regular Polish units.  17 April  = Opening moves = After the Russian plan of surrounding the churches on Saturday was discovered by the Poles, it was decided that the uprising should start immediately. On Holy Wednesday the Polish garrison was secretly provided with volleys and artillery charges and overnight was dispatched to various parts of the city. The Russians were conscious of the preparations for the uprising and their troops were also equipped with additional ammunition. At 03:30 some 20 Polish dragoons left the Mirów barracks and headed for the Saxon Garden. Encountered by a small Russian force equipped with two cannons guarding the Iron Gate, the squadron charged the Russian positions and captured the guns. Soon afterwards the remainder of the Royal Horse Guard regiment left the barracks on foot and headed in two directions: towards the outer gates of the city at Wola and towards the Warsaw Arsenal, where the Russian forces were preparing an assault. The crew of the Arsenal was also joined by a small troop of National Cavalry under Colonel Jan Jerzy Giessler, who crossed the Vistula overnight. Warsaw Arsenal, on the left, was the scene of heavy fighting during the Uprising, as well as 35 years later, during the November Uprising (pictured). At 05:00 the planned Russian assault on the Arsenal started, but was repelled by unexpected opposition from Polish forces. After the first shots, the crew of the Arsenal started giving out arms to the civilian volunteers, who quickly joined the fights. The arsenal was secured, but the Polish plan to catch most of the Russian soldiers on the streets rather than in buildings and barracks failed. One such group armed with a cannon broke through the Warsaw's Old Town to Krasiński Square, and two others started marching along Długa Street. Their action spread the uprising to all parts of the city. Until 06:30 the regular units and the militia clashed with the Russian outposts at Nalewki, Bonifraterska, Kłopot and Leszno streets. The initial clashes caused much confusion as not all forces involved had been notified of the plans of both sides. Among such units was the Royal Foot Guard unit, which broke through to Castle Square, where it was to await further orders. The small troop pledged to defend the monarch as soon as he appeared at the Castle's courtyard, but on hearing the sounds of a battle nearby, the unit left the king and joined the fighting at Miodowa Street; The Russian forces, pushed back after their initial failure at the gates of the Arsenal, withdrew towards Miodowa Street, where they amassed in front of Igelström's palace. There they were shelled by a small Polish force stationed in the gardens of the Krasiński Palace, but destroyed the Polish unit and successfully reorganise and rally. The chaos in the Russian ranks could not be eliminated as Igelström's headquarters had been cut out from the rest of the city and he could not send a request for reinforcement to Russian units stationed outside the city centre and the Russian chain of command had been practically paralysed. By 07:00 the confusion was partially cleared and heavy fighting at Miodowa street turned into a regular battle in the vicinity of both the Arsenal and Igelström's headquarters, as both sides struggled to secure both buildings. Three Russian assault groups, each of them battalion strength, attacked the Arsenal from three sides: from Tłomackie, along Miodowa Street and from Franciszkańska Street. All the Russian assaults were repelled with heavy losses on both sides and the Poles started a counter-attack towards the Russian positions at Miodowa, Senatorska, Leszno and Podwale Streets, but with little success. A witness to the fighting was Jan Piotr Norblin (1740–1830), a French-born Polish painter who created a set of sketches and paintings of the struggle. The assault on Leszno Street was aimed at the Russian battalion occupying positions before the Carmelite Church. After several hours' heavy close-quarters fighting, the Russian forces were forced to retreat to the church itself, where fighting continued. The Russian soldiers surrendered, and only a small detachment, mostly of officers, continued the fight inside the church, where most of them perished. Also the Russian battalion under Major Titov, stationed at Bonifraterska Street, had been attacked around 07:00 by the Poles. After four hours' fighting, the Russians retreated towards the city's western outskirts. At 06:00 the Polish 10th Regiment of Foot under Colonel Filip Hauman had left its barracks at Ujazdów to the south of the city centre, and started its march towards the Royal Castle. As an effect of the chaos in Russian ranks, the regiment reached Nowy Świat Street and Świętokrzyska Streets unopposed by Russian units stationed there, as the Russian commanders did not know what to do. It was stopped by a Russian force at Krakowskie Przedmieście Street, consisting of no less than 600 men and 5 pieces of artillery, and commanded by General Miłaszewicz. The Russian force was strategically dislocated on both sides of the street, in both the Kazimierz Palace (now the Warsaw University rectorate) and before Holy Cross Church. Colonel Hauman started lengthy negotiations with the Russian commander asking him to allow the Polish forces to pass. The negotiations were broken and at 08:00 the Polish regiment assaulted the Russian positions. After a skirmish that ensued the Polish unit was partially dispersed and had to retreat. Parts of the unit under Major Stanisław Lipnicki retreated to the Dominican Church, where the fights continued. Other troop under Lieutenant Sypniewski broke through to the Branicki Palace, yet others found their way farther towards the Old Town, outflanking the Russians. Because of that, the Russian infantry under General Miłaszewicz and a small cavalry force under Prince Gagarin, though victorious, found themselves under crossfire and surrounded. In addition, a small yet loud militia force under Jan Kiliński appeared on their rear and all of the Polish units in the area assaulted the Russians from all directions, which resulted in almost complete destruction of the Russian units. General Miłaszewicz was wounded trying to retreat with the remnants of his force towards the Kazimierz Palace, while Prince Gagarin retreated with some cavalrymen towards the Saxon Garden, where they were ambushed by civilians who killed almost all of them. The 10th Regiment then reformed around noon and moved towards the Castle Square, where it took part in the fights against smaller Russian forces in the Old Town. = City centre = Fighting at Miodowa Street on Krakowskie Przedmieście, sketch by Jan Piotr Norblin, 1794 The victory of the 10th Regiment marked a turning point in the uprising, as it broke the morale of the Russian forces. After noon the fighting in front of Igelström's headquarters, at Miodowa Street and for the Arsenal continued as both sides drew reinforcements from all parts of the city. Russian units put up the strongest defence and although they were forced to retreat in the direction of the Franciscan church, they repelled early Polish attacks and captured the Krasiński Palace which the Poles had been using to fire on them from behind. At the same time the palace's garden remained in Polish hands and heavy fighting spread to that area as well. In other parts of the city smaller Russian forces defended themselves in isolated manors, as was the case of Szanowski's house at the Vistula in the borough of Powiśle, where a small Russian troop offered fierce resistance against the 10th Regiment until late afternoon. Nearby, a Russian force under Major Mayer, consisting of two companies, each armed with a cannon, fortified itself in the Kwieciński's Baths, where it defended itself for several hours. After repeated charges by the 10th Regiment, the Russian commander was left with no more than 80 men, with whom he retreated to the other side of the river. In the meantime, the king and some members of the Targowica Confederation took refuge in the Warsaw Castle. Among them were Piotr Ożarowski, Józef Ankwicz, Great Crown Marshall Fryderyk Józef Moszyński and the king's brother Kazimierz Poniatowski. From there they tried to restore peace, but without any success. Poniatowski nominated two trusted people to take command of the troops: Ignacy Wyssogota Zakrzewski became the mayor of Warsaw, and general Stanisław Mokronowski became the commander-in-chief of the Warsaw troops, but both quickly turned to support the uprising. Brühl Palace in Warsaw. At the same time General Ivan Novitskiy amassed more than half the Russian forces at the western end of Jerusalem Avenue. 4,000 men were withdrawn from there without a shot being fired. Among the units rallied there were forces that – according to the Russian plan – were to secure the entire southern part of Warsaw, including forces under Lieutenant-Colonel Kasztoliński and von Klugen, parts of Igelström's personal guard and the remnants of the force to take part in the battle against the 10th Regiment, commanded by Major Bago. Novitskiy, after several hours of wavering, organised a relief force of 3000 men and 10 cannons, and started a march towards the city centre. The column crossed Marszałkowska Street unopposed and reached Saxon Square. There it was met by a negligible unit of not more than 100 civilians armed with a single 6 pounder cannon, commanded by Captain of Artillery Jacek Drozdowski. The Polish unit opened fire from its cannon and started gradually retreating across the square towards the Brühl's Palace on its northern edge, firing all the way. At the same time the Russian commander did not issue any orders and his column simply stopped under fire. Although much inferior in numbers, training and equipment, Drozdowski's unit was not attacked by the Russian force, as Novitskiy lost control over his troops. The Russian soldiers broke ranks and entered the undefended Saxon Palace, where they seized the cellars full of alcohol. The Poles continued to shell them with artillery for almost three hours, without being attacked. When a company of the 10th Regiment returning from Powiśle appeared at Królewska Street, the Russians started a disorganised retreat towards Jerusalem Avenue, leaving Igelström to his fate. Assault on the Russian Embassy, sketch by Jan Piotr Norblin. The retreat of the Russian unit allowed the Poles to repel other assaults by Russian forces as well, including an attack by a thousand men from Warsaw's New Town towards the northern gate of the Old Town. Although the Russian force broke through to the Old Town, it had lost all its guns and more than half of its men. Also repelled were repeated assaults on the Arsenal from Miodowa Street, under the command of General Tishchev. The Russians, approaching in three columns, did not coordinate their manoeuvres, allowing the Poles to deal with them separately. The first column under Tishchev approached the Arsenal at 15:00 from Miodowa Street. Although one of the building's turrets exploded, the Poles repelled the assault within half an hour, before the Russians had gathered reinforcements. The second Russian column approached the Arsenal through the Krasiński Gardens, but was stopped by massed fire from several cannon concealed in the bushes. The third Russian battalion, commanded by Tishchev personally, approached the Arsenal from the west, along Leszno Street, where it was stopped by the Royal Guard. After a fierce fight, Tishchev died soon after a cannonball ripped his leg off, and the remainder of his force surrendered to the Poles. In these circumstances the Poles began a counter- attack aimed at capturing Igelström's palace and the positions of the forces that he had around him. These included a battalion under Johann Jakob Pistor; a battalion drawn from Marywil commanded by Colonel Parfyeniev; a battalion of the famed Siberian Regiment; and some cavalry under Brigadier Baur. All but Parfyeniev's men had previously been involved in the failed assaults at the Arsenal and towards the Royal Castle, and all were battle-hardened. As the Poles took several buildings along Senatorska Street opposite the palace and fired at the Russians from the windows, the Russians could not reorganise their ranks and hid in the palace and the nearby Capuchin Church. Before 16:00, Działyński's Regiment reached Senatorska Street and began a frontal assault on the palace, but was bloodily repelled by the Russian defenders. Constant fire from the windows and roofs of nearby houses prevented them from mounting a counter-attack and both sides reached a stalemate. Because of that Igelström was left with little option but to await reinforcements from the outside, which did not happen. After dark a small unit under Major Titov broke through to Igelström, but his force was not strong enough to break the stalemate. Unable to reach the palace, the Poles assaulted the Russian positions in front of the Capuchin Church and the adjoining monastery. The Russians withdrew to the courtyard, from where the fighting spread to the entire monastery. The Poles secured the courtyard and placed a cannon there, which allowed them to storm the monastery, but fierce hand-to-hand fighting, with heavy losses on both sides, continued until late evening. In the coming night, some smaller Russian units lost cohesion and attempted to retreat on their own. Many soldiers engaged in looting, and Krasiński's Palace was among the most prominent buildings looted by the soldiers during the Uprising.  18 April  Document of accession of the city of Warsaw to Kościuszko Uprising, signed on 19 April Overnight the fights in various parts of the city continued. The isolated Russian units defended themselves in houses in various parts of the city. In the early morning of 18 April, Mokronowski concentrated on the main remaining Russian stronghold in the city — the embassy at Miodowa Street. The Polish units, reinforced with the civilian volunteers, continued the repeated assaults on the building's courtyard. Although all were bloodily repelled, the Russians suffered significant losses as well, particularly by constant fire from buildings located to the other side of the street. The Russians held a small area delimited by Miodowa and Długa Streets, as well as Krasiński Square and the palace. Believing further defence of his palace was futile, Igelström left only a token force of 400 men there and withdrew to the Krasiński Palace. He planned to prepare a sortie in order to break through from the city centre, but all surrounding streets were filled with Polish troops and cannons. Igelström requested permission to capitulate around 10:00, having been unable to command most of his troops during the uprising. After being granted a truce, he withdrew to the Prussian camp near Warsaw in Powązki, and then further away from the city, towards Karczew. The exact number of troops that retreated with Igelström is unknown and varies from source to source, but most estimates place it at between 300 and 400 men, with 8 cannons. As soon as Igelström's retreat was discovered, the assault on Russian positions was resumed. The remaining troops defending the embassy and covering Igelström's retreat eventually ran out of ammunition and their positions were overrun by 17:00 by the forces of the 10th Regiment under Kalinowski, aided by Kiliński's militia. Polish forces released political prisoners held by Russians in the basement and were able to secure most of the embassy's secret archive, covering all of Russian secret operations in Poland since 1763. Among the prominent captives taken during the final fights for the embassy was Colonel Parfyeniev. Among the captured documents were the lists of various Polish officials on the Russian payroll; many of them were later executed. The Polish forces also captured the treasury of the Russian ambassador, exceeding 95,000 golden ducats. This Polish victory marked the end of the uprising, with the last Russian units either routed or in retreat. The last small spots of Russian resistance were eliminated or surrendered on that day.  Casualties  During the chaotic battle the Russian force lost 2,265 men killed and around 2,000 wounded. In addition, 1926 Russian soldiers were taken prisoner of war, including 161 officers. Losses among Polish regular forces amounted to between 800 and 1000 dead and wounded; civilian casualties and losses among various irregular militia units did not exceed 700.  Aftermath  Several factors contributed to the Russian defeat and losses. Igelström had reduced the size of the garrison, sending some of units to deal with Kościuszko's main forces, and posted his remaining regiments so incompetently that they were easily cut off from each other and overwhelmed by the Polish forces. From the onset of the insurrection, the Polish forces were aided by the civilian population and had surprise on their side; after the crowd captured the city arsenal, Russian soldiers found themselves under attack throughout the city.

The supporters of the Targowica Confederation, responsible for the Second Partition of Poland, became public enemies. If they could not be captured, their portraits were hanged instead. The uprising in Warsaw marked a significant victory for the entire cause of Kościuszko, and echoes of the victory in Warsaw spread across the country. Ignacy Zakrzewski became the city's commander in chief and mayor. General Mokronowski repeatedly begged the King, who was at the same time his cousin, to support the uprising. The king refused and power in the city was seized by the Provisional Temporary Council () composed of Zakrzewski, Mokronowski, Józef Wybicki and Kiliński. Mokronowski was soon removed from the council for his opposition to Kościuszko. On 27 May the council was dissolved, and power passed to Kościuszko's Supreme National Council (). On 9 May four prominent supporters of the Targowica Confederation, including Józef Ankwicz, Józef Kossakowski, hetman Piotr Ożarowski and hetman Józef Zabiełło, were sentenced to death by the Insurrectionary Court and were hanged in Warsaw. A few weeks later, on 28 June, an angry mob stormed the prisons and hanged other supporters of Targowica, including bishop Ignacy Jakub Massalski, prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk, ambassador Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski and others. Felix Potocki was not found; his portrait was hoisted on the gallows instead. Kosciuszko quickly put an end to the lynch mob declaring, \\"What happened in Warsaw yesterday filled my heart with bitterness and sorrow ...Those who do not obey the laws are not worthy of liberty.\\" The National Militia of Warsaw grew to over 20,000 men at arms and constituted a large part of the Polish Army fighting against Russia. This included 1200 horsemen organised by Peter Jazwinski and 6000 under Kiliński. The uprising was also openly commented upon in Russia. As a result of this defeat, Igelström was recalled in disgrace, although he would redeem himself in future fighting. In the 19th century the Uprising of 1794 was presented in a bad light in Imperial Russian historiography, as the fights in Warsaw were referred to as a \\"massacre\\" of unarmed Russian soldiers by Warsaw's mob. Russian historian Platon Zhukovich marked his relation of the events with many horrific, yet counter-factual descriptions of unarmed Russian soldiers being slaughtered in an Orthodox church during the Eucharist, even though there was no Orthodox church in Warsaw at that time, the participation of Kiliński's militia was seriously overrated and no other source confirms the thesis that the Russian garrison was unarmed. The defeat in this battle is sometimes seen as one of the reasons for the massacre of Praga, in which the Russian forces killed between 10,000 and 20,000 civilians of Warsaw upon their reconquest of the city later that year. The Warsaw Uprising is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"WARSZAWA 17 IV – 4 XI 1794\\".

Its members can take bending moment, shear, and axial loads. The two common assumptions as to the behavior of a building frame are (1) that its beams are free to rotate at their connections or (2) that its members are so connected that the angles they make with each other do not change under load. Frameworks with connections of intermediate stiffness will be intermediate between these two extremes. Frameworks with connections of intermediate stiffness are commonly called semirigid frames. The AISC specifications recognize three basic frame types: Rigid Frame, Simple Frame, and Partially Restrained Frame. AISC standard The AISC Steel Specification Commentary on Section B3 provides guidance for the classification of a connection in terms of its rigidity. The secant stiffness of the connection Ks is taken as an index property of connection stiffness. Specifically, Ks = Ms/θs where Ms = moment at service loads, kip-in (N-mm) θs = rotation at service loads, rads The secant stiffness of the connection is compared to the rotational stiffness of the connected member as follows, in which L and EI are the length and bending rigidity, respectively, of the beam.

The Russians were expelled from Vilnius, and thanks to Jasiński's skill, no casualties were sustained during the bloodless uprising.Henry Smith Williams, The Historians' History of the World, The Outlook Company, 1904, Google Print, p.418 Vilnius townspeople also actively participated in the city's defense from the Russians, some even by throwing stones at them. A Russian garrison of some 2,000 was stationed in the spring of 1794 in the city of Vilnius, while Commonwealth forces had only 400 soldiers. In the night of April 11 / 12, upon order of Russian General Nikolai Arseniev, several rebels were arrested. On April 21, Lithuanian Hetman Szymon Kossakowski came to Vilnius, urging the Russians to capture yet more rebels, and attack rebel forces concentrated around the city. Under the circumstances, Jakub Jasinski decided to initiate the insurrection. It began in the night of April 22 / 23, and after a short fight, the city was under rebel control. On April 24 the “Act of Rebellion of the Lithuanian Nation” was announced. The rebels declared their unity with the Kosciuszko Uprising, which had begun in Lesser Poland. On the same day, April 24, the so-called High Temporary Council was created, headed by the Mayor of Vilnius, Antoni Tyzenhauz, and Voivode of Navahrudak, Jozef Niesiolowski. It had 31 members, and formed separate offices to manage the military forces, the administration and the treasury. Jakub Jasinski was named commandant of rebel forces in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On April 25, Great Hetman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Szymon Marcin Kossakowski was hanged as a traitor of the Commonwealth. On June 4 Tadeusz Kosciuszko dissolved the Council, as he regarded it too radical, and replaced it with Central Office of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Also, Kosciuszko dismissed Colonel Jasinski, naming General Michal Wielhorski commandant of the rebel army in Lithuania. Preparing for the Russians return, even the Lithuanian nobles of Vilnius participated in the digging of the defensive lines near the city. On July 19, the Russians attacked Vilnius The city was defended by 500 soldiers and 1,500 armed members of the municipal militia. Russian army, commanded by General Gotthard Johann von Knorring, had some 8,000 soldiers, with several cannons. After two days of heavy fighting, Vilnius remained in the hands of the rebels. On August 11, General von Knorring, whose forces had grown to 12,000 soldiers, initiated another assault on Vilnius. The city, whose defense was commanded by General Antoni Chlewiński, capitulated after one day.

Growing up on a council estate Cowie has gained mainstream and underground fame through his music and his DJ and live performances. He launched the record labels Hook Recordings and Bellboy Records in 1991. In 2001 he released the album Best Behavior. Background The son of Brian and Ruth Cowie, he has two older brothers, Martin and Brian Jr. He grew up in the council estate of Torry in Aberdeen where he described his childhood as \\"normal.\\" Cowie didn't particularly enjoy his early school years, saying \\"I couldn't wait to leave and near the end of my secondary school year I turned up occasionally. Instead of school I went to the library or the art gallery\\". Career Cowie achieved mainstream and underground success through his own brand of eclectic music ranging from cutting edge dance to indie electronic. A particularly successful and prolific period for Cowie was when he launched two dance labels in 1992: Hook Recordings and Bellboy Records. The now defunct labels () achieved worldwide fame and were among the most successful and influential dance labels to come out of the UK scene. Today the labels' sound continue to influence and inspire a new generation of producers and musicians. A large part of the labels sound must be credited to Cowie. Around seventy five percent of the labels' output were a Chris Cowie production under one of his many aliases. Cowie has released in the region of one hundred and fifty separate recordings during a fifteen-year period. With such a prolific output Cowie decided early on in his career to create aliases to combat audience fatigue. He created around fifteen aliases, two of which were highly successful: Vegas Soul and X-Cabs. =As X-Cabs= Under this name, Cowie has recorded many original tracks and a solo album entitled Chemistry, as well as several remixes and the DJ mix album Exposure 1. Tracks Cowie has recorded under this alias include the highly successful Euro hit \\"Neuro\\" (of which a new version is released every year) and the subliminal \\"Infectious\\", which are featured on a multitude of vinyl releases and compilation albums. His remixes include Joshua Ryan's \\"Don't Look Back\\", Transa's \\"Prophase\\", and Sandra Collins's \\"Flutterby\\". His most successful remix was ATB's \\"Don't Stop\\" which reached Number 3 in the UK charts. His unique sound under this alias is still inspiring a new generation of electronic producers today more than thirteen years after its inception. =As Vegas Soul= Cowie released a number of 12\\" singles under this alias. 22 of these singles including new material were released on the critically acclaimed double CD Best Behaviour voted 8th best album of the year in Muzik magazine. Cowies Vegas Soul moniker was championed by a broad range of DJs and music lovers including John Peel, Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, and Danny Tenaglia. Chris Cowie once said \\"The success and the unique sound of Hook Recordings is down to the music I make for Bellboy under aliases such as Vegas Soul. The sound and vibe of Hook generally stems from Bellboy. When I work with an artist or write my own track for Hook the sound is basically a more accessible Bellboy type deal which in turn has been influenced by the early soulful techno stuff.\\" =Re-Launch of Hook-Recordings & Bellboy Records= Cowie re-launched Hook Recordings and Bellboy Records May 2008. For the first time the Hook-Bellboy tracks will be available for digital download. The Hook- Bellboy team will also be releasing new tracks in 2008.

Tom Purvis (12 June 188827 August 1959) was a British painter and commercial poster artist. His work was part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics. Early life Purvis was born in Bristol,http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/purvis- tom-1888 the son of sailor and marine artist T G Purvis.https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07976/tom-purvis He studied at Camberwell School of Art and worked for six years at the advertising firm of Mather & Crowther before becoming a freelance designer.http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/purvis- tom-1888 Purvis developed a bold, two-dimensional style using large blocks of vivid flat colour and eliminating detail. He fought in the First World War in the Artists RiflesAppointed 2nd Lt, 28 Nov 1917, invalided out 1 Mar 1919 (London Gazette) London and North Eastern Railway From 1923 to 1943 Purvis worked for the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER)http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/purvis-tom-1888 under the direction of Advertising Manager William Teasdale and then his successor Charles Dandridge, who both allowed him considerable freedom in his designs. During his time at the LNER Purvis produced over 100 posters, around 5-6 per year or one every two months. He enjoyed a very high status in the LNER's advertising department as he was one of the major designers involved in the recognisable bold and graphic LNER poster style. He was so important to the LNER that he was paid a retainer of approximately £450 per annum to carry out his work. His posters for the LNER largely avoided depictions of the trains themselves but rather concentrated on portraying the resorts that were the holiday destinations of travelers and the leisure pursuits that could be enjoyed there. Sex appeal was quite a strong element of Purvis's work, with many posters portraying women in bathing costumes with bare arms and legs—quite risqué in 1930's Britain! As well as individual posters, Purvis also produced two sets of six posters for the LNER that could either stand alone or be joined together to produce a single, overall image.http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/purvis-tom-1888 The ... by LNER series portrays six seaside resorts, each shown at an unusual angle, to form a continuous landscape in the background as the posters, like the trains themselves, travel up the east coast of Britain from Essex to Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and finally Northumberland. The East Coast Joys set, depicting various leisure activities, has a relaxed, simplified style and the warm colours give it an almost Mediterranean Sea feel, emphasising that the east coast is 'the drier side of Britain'. Other work As well as his work for the LNER, Purvis also designed posters for the Gentlemans' outfitters Austin Reed and for the 1932 British Industries Fair. In 1930 he joined the Society of Industrial Artists, a group which put pressure on industry to improve standards of training for graphic designers and provide a wider range of employment for them. In 1936 Purvis became one of the first Royal Designers for Industry. He created the \\"It's Up to You\\" poster of Britannia, standing by the Union Jack, during the Second World War, but gave up poster design after the war to paint portraits and religious pictures.http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/purvis- tom-1888 Publications *\\"Introduction\\", Poster Progress.

Polish forces were led by Tadeusz Kościuszko, and the Russians and Prussians by Alexander Tormasov, future eminent general of the Napoleonic Wars. Tormasov was aided by Prussian General Francis Favrat, who emphasized the use of artillery, which put Russian- Prussian forces in the advantage. Background Following the Russian defeat at the Battle of Raclawice, the Prussians entered Poland to help confront the Polish revolt. Prussia and Russia were threatened the sanctuary Poland offered serfs and Prussia was additionally threatened by their burghers lured to Poland's promise of democracy and free-market economy. On the morning of 6 June, General Wodzicki noted, \\"It is impossible that Denisov could have amassed such an army. My eyes must be wrong, but I can see Prussians.\\" Kosciuszko had received assurances the Prussians would remain neutral. Russian forces were placed on the left wing, while Prussian army was located on the right wing. Battle The combined Russo-Prussian forces of 26,500 were victorious, defeating Kosciuszko's army of 15,000 with cannon fire.Storozynski, A., 2009, The Peasant Prince, New York: St. Martin's Press, Polish peasant hero, Wojciech Bartosz Głowacki, died of the wounds he sustained during this battle. Other Polish military commanders who took part in the battle were General Adam Poninski, General Antoni Madalinski, General Jan Grochowski and Duke Eustachy Sanguszko. Apart from Glowacki, two Polish generals died in the battle: Jozef Wodzicki and Jan Grochowski. Found on the battlefield by General Sanguszko, the wounded Kosciuszko stated, \\"I want to die here\\", as he was ridden to safety. Aftermath Kosciuszko's rebels retreated to Warsaw while the combined Russian and Prussian force captured Krakow on 15 June. Austria then invaded Poland from the south.

Antonio Scarfoglio was the son of Edoardo Scarfoglio and Matilde Serao, both well- known Neapolitan writers of the turn of the 20th century and founders of il Mattino, the large Neapolitan daily newspaper. He broke into reporting with a dramatic account of the devastating 1906 eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. In 1908 he was one of the three-man team that manned the Züst, the Italian entry in the six-car around-the-world automobile race, known as The Great Race. The Italian car was one of the eventual three finishers. Scarfoglio wrote a book about that exploit: Il giro del mondo in automobile (Round the World in a Motor-Car) published in 1909. He then reported on the 1908 Messina earthquake, and in June of the following year reported from Adana, Turkey, on the infamous massacre of the Armenian population. In 1910 he published a widely read interview in the Paris paper, Le Matin, with empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III; he co-founded a film journal, L'arte muta (The Silent Art) in 1915 and in 1924 was responsible for producing Italy's first newspaper photo supplement section, il Mattino Illustrato, using the new rotogravure printing process. In general, he is viewed as one who took advantage of the good fortune of living in the same age as prominent literary and political figures of the young nation-state of modern Italy such as D'Annunzio and Crispi in order to help shape early Italian journalism.

Career and research Priest is a recognised authority in solar magnetohydrodynamics (or MHD for short), the study of the subtle, and often nonlinear, interaction between the Sun's magnetic field and its plasma interior or atmosphere, treated as a continuous medium. Priest is an applied mathematician and, along with the other members of his research group at St Andrews, is currently investigating a large number of solar phenomena, including sunspots, coronal heating, wave propagation, magnetic reconnection, magnetic instabilities, magnetic structures and helioseismology. This is done using mathematical modelling techniques and observational data from satellites such as SoHO, Yohkoh and TRACE, or ground- based observatories such as Kitt Peak and Big Bear. In 2000 he was the James Arthur Prize Lecturer at Harvard University. Professor Priest has received a number of academic awards for his research, including Hale Prize of the American Astronomical Society (2002), and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in the same year. He is notable in the solar physics community as something of an evangelist for the importance of magnetic reconnection in driving many solar phenomena, and as an explanation of the solar coronal heating problem. As an applied mathematician, his research interests involve constructing mathematical models for the subtle and complex ways in which magnetic fields interact with plasmas in the atmosphere of the Sun and in more exotic cosmic objects. In particular, he is trying to understand how the corona of the Sun is heated to several million degrees and how magnetic energy is converted into other forms in solar flares. In the area of science and religion, he considers himself aware of the importance of trying in small ways to encourage dialogue and understanding between Islam and Christianity and recently spoke on science and culture to 850 schoolchildren in Alexandria, Egypt. He has also preached in St Andrews on the tensions between Christianity and science and spoke on \\"Creativity in Science\\" at a conference on Creativity and the Imagination. He is active in the local Anglican church and enjoys hill-walking, bridge, singing in a couple of choirs and spending time with his wife Clare and four children.Faraday Institute Biography Professor Priest retired from full-time teaching and research in 2010, and was awarded a two- year Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship in 2011. He retains a link with St Andrews as Emeritus Professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics. In 2020, Priest received from the European Physical Society the prestigious ESPD Senior Prize for \\"long-standing leadership via mentoring, supervising and field- defining textbooks and for fundamental contributions in key topics of solar magnetohydrodynamics, particularly magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere and solar coronal heating.\\"[European Physical Society webpage] =Recent selected publications= * Priest, E.R.

I-35 splits into two branch routes, I-35W and I-35E at Hillsboro. I-35W runs north for , carrying its own separate sequence of exit numbers. It runs through Fort Worth before rejoining with I-35E to reform I-35 in Denton. It is the more direct route for long-distance expressway traffic, as is noted on signs on I-35 leading into the I-35W/I-35E splits. Historically, other interstates were given directional suffixes. On every other interstate, the directional suffixes were phased out by giving the route a loop or spur designation. In the case of I-35, since both branches return to a unified interstate beyond the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, the AASHTO committees allowed the suffixes to remain. I-35 also splits into I-35E and I-35W in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota. During the 1970s, billboards existed on I-35 encouraging travelers to take the faster and shorter I-35W route. Route description The Fort Worth skyline from I-35W southbound Interstate 35 splits into two separately named interstate highways just north of Hillsboro, Texas. The routes fork to the northwest and northeast, with Interstate 35W taking the northwest route and Interstate 35E travelling off to the northeast toward Dallas. I-35W travels northwest past the Hillsboro airport through generally rolling farm and ranchlands. It then intersects with US Route 67 on the west side of Alvarado. It continues northwest into the southern edge of Fort Worth. At an intersection with State Highway 174 the route turns due north into greater Fort Worth, passing just west of Fort Worth Spinks Airport. Further north, the road reaches a five level interchange with Interstate 20. The route continues north, reaching downtown Fort Worth. Here it reaches intersections with Interstate 30, U.S. Highway 287, and U.S. Highway 377. I-35W travels north away from downtown concurrent with US 287, next intersecting Interstate 820 just east of Fort Worth Meacham International Airport. Just north of this intersection, US 287 splits to the northwest, along with the southern terminus of U.S. Highway 81. I-35W then gradually shifts to the northeast, passing Fort Worth Alliance Airport and Texas Motor Speedway. It reaches its northern merging point on the southwest side of Denton, merging back together with I-35E to reform Interstate 35, which continues off to the north.

He was Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Oxford from 1972 to 1984. He also served as Fellow and Chaplain of All Souls College, Oxford, from 1964 to 2001. Birth and early education McManners, known as Jack to his family and friends, was born in Ferryhill, County Durham to Joseph and Ann McManners. His mother was a school teacher who converted his coal miner father to the Anglican faith. His father entered the priesthood, eventually becoming the vicar of Ferryhill and subsequently a canon of Durham Cathedral. McManners attended Spennymoor grammar school before winning an exhibition to St Edmund Hall, Oxford in 1936. While at Oxford he took a First in Modern History in 1939. Military service In September 1939 Great Britain entered World War II prompting McManners immediately to volunteer for military service. He joined his local regiment the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, where he made his name as a winger in their soccer team, and completed basic training. However, when the Army realised he had recently been awarded a First Class Honours degree, the Regiment shelved its plans for him to become a driving instructor. Instead he was sent to the OCTU at Fenham Barracks where he was put through basic training for a second time, and was commissioned. McManners served in the Western Desert Campaign and was at the Siege of Tobruk. He was made Adjutant of the First Battalion, under Commanding Officer Lt Col Forbes -Watson. Amongst other military skills, McManners had made himself an expert in the use of the sun compass. This paid off in the breakout from Tobruk. With a water truck and part of battalion headquarters, McManners managed to escape from the German encirclement of Tobruk. His plan involved driving at night through German Panzer units, then far south into the lethal and at that time unmapped Quattarra Depression. When the battalion re- grouped at Alexandria, only 10% remained, the rest captured or killed. He and Lt Col Forbes Watson reformed the battalion with men sent out from the UK, in time for the final battles of the Western Desert campaign - and El Alamein. McManners also served with the 210 British Liaison Unit (Greek Mission) in Alexandria to help prepare Greece for restoration of constitutional government. In his later years, McManners talked of his time as the Adjutant of his regiment's First Battalion - its Regular battalion, of the ten formed for the Second World War, to have been his greatest achievement. Ordination and early teaching career While in the military McManners decided to follow his father's vocation and become ordained into the Church of England. He studied at St Chad's College, Durham and was ordained as a deacon in 1947 and a priest in 1948. He first served as curate of Leeds Parish Church for 10 months. Then, in 1948, invited back to his alma mater to be the Chaplain and lecture in History. In 1951 he married Sarah Errington whom he met while studying in Durham. They had two sons, Hugh and Peter, and two daughters, Ann and Helen. Both his wife and children survived him. In 1956 he accepted the chair of History at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. He remained for four years before moving to the University of Sydney as the chair of History from 1960-1965. Return to England He returned to England and Oxford University from 1965-1966 to be a Senior Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. Following Oxford he served as a professor in history at the University of Leicester. In 1972 McManners was appointed to the Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History and returned to teach at Oxford and serve in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford until his retirement from teaching in 1984. He was invited by All Souls College to be the chaplain, and was appointed a Fellow at the college in 1986. It was not until 2001, due to health concerns, that he resigned as chaplain after which he was elected to an honorary fellowship. Published works In 1960 McManners's first book, French Ecclesiastical Society Under the Ancient Regime; a Study of Angers in the Eighteenth Century, was published helping to establish him as a respected scholar of French history. It was a detailed examination of church life on a local level in a small provincial city. The study of common society contrasted with most of the works of the time that only concentrated on the upper class.The Times, 2006, p. 54 While at Leicester he published French revolution and the church and Church and State in France, 1870-1914. He won the 1982 Wolfson History Prize for Death and the Enlightenment. In a 1986 review Joseph Tempesta of Ithaca College describes it as \\"extensively researched\\" and he strongly recommends it as it \\"brings the era to life\\".Tempesta, 1986, p. 181-182 It was also hailed by The Times as \\"one of the ten best non-fiction books of the year\\". McManners was the general editor of the Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity that was published in 1990. It was a best seller with excellent scholarly standards.Briggs, 2006, p. 44 The two volume Church and Society in Eighteenth-century France published in 1998 \\"represents an enormous achievement\\" as reported by Raymond Mentzer of Montana State University.Mentzer, 2000, p. 437 It is two volumes, more than 1600 pages of text documenting four generations of pre-revolutionary France and the culmination of more than 50 years of research. In 2002 McManners published the autobiographical Fusilier: Recollections and Reflections, 1939-1945 documenting his experiences during the war. His final book, All Souls and the Shipley Case 1808-1810 documented an early 19th-century sex scandal at All Souls College. When doing unrelated research McManners found a sealed packet of letters that became the basis for this book.

It was first published (anonymously) in 1920. Description The book is divided into two parts: an anthology entitled “Justin Moreward Haig” and describing a mysterious person identified only by that pseudonym through a series of anecdotal stories, and a parable illustrating certain principles of occult philosophy entitled “The Circuitous Journey.” Virtually all the attention drawn by the book has centered on the person and identity of Haig, who is asserted to be a real person (a “very well known Englishman”) who was living in London at the time the book was written. The author of the book claims to have become friends with Haig and to have found him to be a most remarkable individual--an initiate or adept, in occult terms. The anecdotes illustrate the somewhat unconventional philosophy held by Haig through the retelling of various meetings and encounters with him and with others, whom Haig usually tries to advise in spiritual or philosophical terms, with varying results. The second part of the book is a highly symbolic and traditional parable in which an assortment of occult principles and virtues are illustrated. This fictional portion of the book tells the story of Antonius, a wealthy and jaded individual who decides to set aside his life of materialistic pleasures and seek greater occult truths on a journey into the mountains to meet the members of a spiritual Brotherhood, accompanied by a female companion named Cynara. Controversy For many years, there was speculation on the identity of the book's author as well as the identity of Justin Moreward Haig. Today, it is known that Cyril Scott wrote the book, but the true identity of Haig, and indeed the question of his actual existence, remain controversial. Sequels The Initiate was followed by two sequels, The Initiate in the New World and The Initiate in the Dark Cycle. The first sequel discusses the adventures of the author and Justin Haig in the United States, and the second discusses the experiences of the pair upon their return to England; both retain the format of an anthology of short anecdotes, although they more closely approach the form of instructive lectures than do those of the first book. The sequels also reference and sometimes critique occult organizations and persons, such as the Theosophical Society, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Helena Blavatsky.

The Poles were led by Tadeusz Kościuszko. Kościuszko with 6,200 men, who planned to prevent the linking of three larger Russian corps, commanded by generals Fyodor Denisov, Iwan Fersen and Alexander Suvorov. He also had requested the support of Adam Poniński (who had 4,000 soldiers), but Poniński failed to arrive on the battlefield in time.Storozynski, A., 2009, The Peasant Prince, New York: St. Martin's Press, Battle Kosciuszko had spent the night in an abandoned manor house of the Zamoyskis with his army in the field in front flanked by woods, and a river behind the house. Denisov and then Fersen attacked the next morning, and the Poles burned the village on their left flank to prevent it being used as cover. Initially, the Russian advance was slowed by the mud, but after three hours the Poles ran out of ammunition for their cannons. The Russian infantry then made a bayonet charge and slaughtered the Poles for the next three hours. After three horses were shot from under him, Kosciuszko finally tried leaving the battlefield, but his horse tripped. A Cossack stabbed him with a pike from behind, followed by a second Cossack who stabbed him in the left hip. Attempting to take his own life, Kosciuszko found his pistol empty, and then passed out in the mud, but was not identified as the Polish commanding general. He was stripped by two unknown horsemen, but then saved and carried away from the battlefield by Denisov's Cossacks and later taken prisoner. Aftermath Kosciuszko was taken to St. Petersburg by General Alexei Khrushchev and two thousand Russian soldiers. The news of the fall of Warsaw reached him on 17 November.

It is one of the most popular plays in the modern kabuki repertory. Belonging to the repertories of the Naritaya and Kōritaya guilds, the play was first performed in March 1840 at the Kawarazaki- za, in Edo. Ichikawa Ebizō V, Ichikawa Kuzō II, and Ichikawa Danjūrō VIII played the leading roles of Benkei, Togashi, and Yoshitsune, respectively. The lines of Ichikawa Danjūrō and Matsumoto Kōshirō have come to be particularly celebrated for playing the role of Benkei in Kanjinchō. Kanjinchō was the first kabuki played adapted closely from the Noh theater.Kabuki Plays on Stage II: Villainy and Vengeance, 1773-1799. (2002) p. 244-245. Though bearing the same name and general narrative concept as a 1702 play, one of the Kabuki Jūhachiban, the modern version of Kanjinchō, going back to 1840, is believed to not be directly derived from or connected to this earlier aragoto piece. Akira Kurosawa's film The Men who Tread on the Tiger's Tail is partly based on Kanjinchō. Kanjinchō is performed so often that it is said that seasoned kabuki actors consider it an insult to be asked to rehearse it.Kabuki Plays on Stage II: Villainy and Vengeance, 1773-1799. (2002) p. 244-245. Summary Ichikawa Ennosuke II performing Benkei's signature roppō on the hanamichi Taking place in the mid- to late 12th century, the play begins with Togashi Saemon, a local noble, just having been charged with defending a particular gate along the road. He warns his men to be vigilant, for Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the great warrior of the Minamoto clan, is said to be traveling on the road, disguised as a yamabushi. Yoshitsune and his follower Benkei enter to music, and when stopped by Togashi's men, claim that they are simple priests journeying around the northern provinces, seeking donations for the Tōdai-ji in Nara. Togashi thus asks that they prove themselves to be priests and asks for a kanjinchō, a subscription list of those who have donated already. Benkei, having been a mountain ascetic (yamabushi), is educated in traditional Buddhist teachings and has little trouble passing as a priest. But he does not have a kanjinchō; so, in a particularly famous moment in kabuki, he pulls out a blank scroll and begins reading from it as if it were a real subscription list. Though Togashi soon gets a look at the blank sheet, he admires Benkei's skill and daring, and after asking a series of difficult questions about Buddhism and the life of a priest, all of which Benkei answers correctly, lets the pair pass anyway. About to escape entirely, the pair are stopped when one of Togashi's guards notices that the porter looks like Yoshitsune. Benkei, thinking quickly, pretends that Yoshitsune is simply his personal porter and begins to beat him for arousing suspicion and causing trouble. The barrier guard insists that they won't pass unless he checks that the porter is not Yoshitsune, and Benkei accuses him of trying to steal from their baggage. On the verge of starting to fight, Benkei states that, to demonstrate that his porter is not Yoshitsune, he will beat him to death (at the time, beating one's own master was a lèse-majesté crime). Togashi sees through the ruse, but pretends not to, on account of his admiration for Benkei's devotion to his master. Continuing on past the gate, Yoshitsune thanks his friend, who apologizes for beating him and bursts into tears—for, supposedly, the first time in his adult life. Togashi returns. Asking forgiveness for his manners, he invites Benkei to drink some sake with him. He accepts, but exaggerates with the alcohol and gets drunk. He starts describing some of his memories from his youth, accompanied by the shamisen ensemble, and then asks Togashi for more sake. Togashi asks instead that Benkei dance for him. Benkei then starts to perform the \\"dance of longevity.\\" At one point, he signals Yoshitsune to depart while the barrier guards are not watching. As Benkei leaves, he turns one last time to Togashi, whom he knows now has to pay with his own life for helping the enemy. As the curtain falls, with Benkei alone on the hanamichi, he thanks the gods for allowing his master to pass. The play ends with Benkei performing a special roppō, a Kabuki technique for leaving the scene, called Tobiroppō, jumping on the hanamichi.

The Club was founded in 1906 and is located in a Georgian-style building set within its own elegant grounds, close to the town centre. It overlooks the finish line of the Henley Royal Regatta and is also slightly downstream (and on the opposite bank) from Leander Club and upstream of Remenham Club and Upper Thames Rowing Club. There is a rowing club on the river at Phyllis Court, the Phyllis Court Rowing Club, for recreational rowing. History The original building on this site dates from 1301. It was the manor house of Henley-on-Thames and was known as Fillets Court. Queen Anne, the consort of King James I, visited the house in 1604. In 1643, Oliver Cromwell built a wall which still edges the garden near the river. In the mid 17th century, Phillis Court was the home of Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605–1675), parliamentarian and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, who before his death gave it up to his son William Whitelock, later Tory member of parliament for the University of Oxford.Humphry William Woolrych, Eminent Serjeants-at-law of the English bar (Vol. 1, 1869), p. 381 In 1689, William of Orange, on his way to London, held his first court here. Sir William Whitelock died at the house in 1717.John Phillips, Titles and honours conferred by His late Majesty King George I. and His present Majesty, in Great-Britain and Ireland (1728), p. 115: \\"Sir William Whitelock of Phillis-Court in the County of Oxon. Knight, Member for the University of Oxford, one of His Majesty's Council at Law, Nov. 22. 1717.\\" The property later belonged to Edward Cooper, who sold Phillis Court to Sambrooke Freeman, the owner of Fawley Court nearby, in 1768.Emily J. Climenson (editor), Passages from the Diaries of Mrs. Philip Lybbe Powys, Kessinger Publishing, 2008. . In 1939, the clubhouse was requisitioned by HM Government for the duration of the Second World War. It was first used as a WAAF Officers' mess for the Central Interpretation Unit at RAF Medmenham. Later it housed a top-secret unit making important photographic mosaics and models of the future Allied landing beaches in France and planning many raids including the \\"Dambusters\\". The clubhouse ended the war on a more peaceful note being used by the American Red Cross as a rest centre for war- weary airmen. On 6 November 1998, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Club before travelling upriver by boat to open the River and Rowing Museum. Phyllis Court has been completely rebuilt twice. The present building dates from 1837. The Club was partially rebuilt after a fire in 1976.

By contrast, autogamy is the term used for self-fertilization. In humans, the fertilization event is an instance of allogamy. Self-fertilization occurs in hermaphroditic organisms where the two gametes fused in fertilization come from the same individual. This is common in plants (see Sexual reproduction in plants) and certain protozoans. In plants, allogamy is used specifically to mean the use of pollen from one plant to fertilize the flower of another plant and usually synonymous with the term \\"cross-fertilization\\" or \\"cross-pollination\\" (outcrossing), though the latter term can be used more specifically to mean pollen exchange between different plant strains or even different plant species (where the term cross- hybridization can be used) rather than simply between different individuals. Parasites having complex life cycles can pass through alternate stages of allogamous and autogamous reproduction, and the description of a hitherto unknown allogamous stage can be a significant finding with implications for human disease. Avoidance of inbreeding depression Allogamy ordinarily involves cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals leading to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.Michod, R.E. (1994). \\"Eros and Evolution: A Natural Philosophy of Sex\\" Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts. By contrast, close inbreeding, including self- fertilization in plants and automictic parthenogenesis in hymenoptera, tends to lead to the harmful expression of deleterious recessive alleles (inbreeding depression). In dioecious plants, the stigma may receive pollen from several different potential donors. As multiple pollen tubes from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the ovary, the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants. Thus post-pollination selection may occur in order to promote allogamy and avoid inbreeding depression. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor–recipient relatedness.

The group has an eclectic style, blending elements from the traditional French chanson and pop, American jazz and swing, Roma music, and North African music. They have performed live all over the world. The mainstream success of their second album Living Room (2000) gave the group a unique status as a French indie band capable of drawing crowds not only in France, where the album went gold, but also in Australia and the USA where they have chalked up over twenty tours.  Background  Bénédicte Grimault (born 1966, Berry-Bouy, near Bourges) studied cinema in Paris and became attracted to the punk movement. Taking the stage name Belle du Berry, she joined the group Les Pervers Polymorphes Inorganisés (PPI), and in 1989 joined Les Champêtres de Joie and began playing the accordion. Les Champêtres de Joie was a musical revue that presented early 20th century chansons, including those by Damia, Fréhel, Marianne Oswald and Arletty, in a punk- influenced style. Among the group members were drummer François Jeannin and guitarist Potzi. Belle du Berry and Champêtres de Joie collaborated with choreographer Philippe Decouflé to create the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics at Albertville in 1992. She contributed to several theatre and film projects in the early 1990s, including a revue about the Dadaist movement, a tribute to Boris Vian, and acted the role of singer Yvette Guilbert in the Toulouse-Lautrec biographical film Lautrec.  Biography  In 1994, Belle du Berry began collaborating with Australian musician David Lewis in the musical revue Cabaret Sauvage. Lewis had moved to France in his early twenties, and studied at the Paris Conservatoire. He made a name for himself on the French music scene playing with Arthur H and Manu Dibango. The pair formed the group Paris Combo in 1995, with François Jeannin, Potzi, and bass player Manohisa Razanajato. They began to hone their sound playing in cafés and barges along the Seine under the name \\"Paris Combo\\". Du Berry, whose musical roots go back to post-punk bands, cited influences such as Arletty, the Surrealists, and a panoply of more recent artists including the B-52's. Potzi's Django-influenced guitar often mixes with François’ ska or Latin grooves to create a fascinating blend. Lewis attributes the group's approach to Paris’ cosmopolitan atmosphere. Paris Combo's eponymous 1997 debut disc arrived as the swing revival was in full bloom, yet the band's wide-ranging mix of musical influences instantly set them apart from other groups in the genre, winning critical praise and appealing to international audiences. The momentum continued with the release of their second album, Living Room, which went gold in France in 2000, and confirmed the group's international standing, with tours of the United States, Australia and Asia and a nomination at the French industry awards, Les Victoires de la Musique. The following year Paris Combo released their third set, Attraction, with a series of concerts at the prestigious Cité de la Musique in Paris. In early 2003, Paris Combo's \\"Terrien d'Eau Douce\\" won in The 2nd Annual Independent Music Awards for Best World Song. Their fourth album, Motifs, in 2004, was supported by a tour that included Australasia, Brazil and the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles where the group was accompanied by the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. The band then took a break for several years. During that time, Belle du Berry and David Lewis continued to work together, producing the album Quizz (2009) and performing together on stage. Paris Combo started working together again in 2010, with new bassist Emmanuel Chabbey. They toured widely in Europe, the Middle East and in the US, and released their fifth album, 5, in 2013 on the DRG/eOne label. Media response to 5 was enthusiastic and in 2013–14, they sold out venues across the country with their first US tours in a decade and a triumphant return to Australia in 2015. Paris Combo's latest album, Tako Tsubo, was released worldwide in 2017, and again accompanied extensive touring in the US, Australia and NZ and Europe.

Opened in 1971, the mall was noted for having once been the only shopping center in the United States to feature rival department store chains Kmart and Walmart as its anchor stores until 2013. The mall closed its doors Jan 2, 2016 to undergo a $50 Million renovation by new owners CEA Group. It has been renamed SouthCoast Marketplace.http://wpri.com/2015/10/27/new-harbour-mall- destined-to-become-SouthCoast-Marketplace/ History Harbour Mall opened in 1971 with discounters Bradlees and Grant City (the discount division of W.T. Grant) as its anchor stores, the latter of which was converted to Kmart following the 1976 closure of the Grant City chain. Except for the addition of a movie theater in 1984, Harbour Mall remained largely unchanged until a 1993 renovation which added skylights, new entrance canopies, and re-designing of the common mall areas. The mall's movie theaters closed in September 2007 and re-opened in 2017. In its final years, the New Harbor Mall was largely empty except for its anchor stores. In 2015, a reporter for the Fall River's Herald News described the mall's interior as \\"Dark, depressing and almost eerie, with most of its store spaces shuttered and empty.\\" Among the few interior stores left in the mall at that time were Payless ShoeSource and Rainbow, with other previous tenants such as GNC and RadioShack having already closed their locations in the mall after Walmart relocated to a new, larger store elsewhere in Fall River in 2013. The interior of the mall was closed on January 2, 2016. Kmart, the last remaining tenant, closed its store in the mall in May 2016. Following its conversion from the New Harbor Mall to SouthCoast Marketplace, the property is now a power center with no indoor mall sections. The anchor tenant of the plaza is a Market Basket supermarket, which opened in October 2017. Other tenants include PetSmart, Staples, Old Navy, TJ Maxx, Ulta Beauty, Supercuts, Five Below, the Picture Show movie theater, Qdoba, Five Guys, Starbucks and Jersey Mike's Subs.

Great rooms typically have raised ceilings, and are usually placed at or near the center of the home. Great rooms have been common in American homes since the early 1990s. The New York Times called the great room \\"the McMansion's signature space.\\" Description The concept of a great room hearkens back to the romanticized ideal of great halls and great chambers in medieval castles and mansions, which contained one large central room where everything happened. Developers of mid-range suburban homes in America tried to solve the problem of the \\"dead\\" living room and the split between the living and family rooms by \\"returning\\" to the idea of the great room. The general concept is one relatively central room, the crossroads of the house to be used for all of the family functions traditionally split between living and family rooms. The dominant feature of the great room is the raised ceiling, higher than other parts of the house, typically two stories with arching ceilings often referred to in real estate jargon as \\"cathedral ceilings\\". Different great rooms will combine different functions, e.g. some may incorporate a reading area, thus bringing the traditional study function into the scheme of the room, while others may forgo this particular function. Some great room designs incorporate the functions of the traditional dining room as well. In the most general sense, great rooms are typically found on the lower level of American multi-story homes built in the second half of the 20th century. In many houses the great room will also adjoin the kitchen, often separated just by a counter instead of a full wall. History The modern great room concept traces back to the \\"multipurpose room\\" in modernist homes built by Joseph Eichler in California in the 1950s and 1960s. Developers started building high-end houses with great rooms in the 1970s and 1980s, at first simply adding vaulted entryways to ranch-style houses. An example of this is the house in the television series The Brady Bunch. Great rooms became a nearly ubiquitous feature of suburban homes constructed in America in the 1990s and 2000s. However, by the mid-2000s, the Wall Street Journal reported that home buyers were not as enthusiastic about great rooms. Common complaints included the cost to heat and cool them, that they were difficult to clean and paint due to height and irregular angles, and that they simply were wasted space. Great rooms were initially popular with homeowners. According to builders asked by the Wall Street Journal, this was because homeowners wanted a way to show off wealth in a growing economy. But about 15 years after great rooms became widely popular in the early 1990s, developers across America were getting fewer demands for houses with great rooms, preferring instead houses with increased floor space and numbers of rooms. Owners of existing homes with great rooms were sometimes opting to add new rooms or lofts in the great room's ceiling space, which can cost as much as 50% less than adding a conventional addition to the house. According to the United States Census Bureau, from 2005 to 2007 expenditures on the interior restructuring of homes rose by about 40% but spending on new-room additions fell by 57%, which a census bureau statistician said can be explained in part by the retrofitting of great rooms. However, much of the motivation for working within the existing footprint of the home may be due to state and municipal regulations which may trigger higher taxes, additional permit hurdles, or septic system redesigns when a building's footprint increases. In 2007, Money listed great rooms as a fad whose time had passed. The magazine reported that a typical great room costs $150 to $350 per square foot, whereas building conventional rooms cost $125 to $250 a square foot, and concluded that the supposed benefits of a great room (unifying family activities into one room) did not justify its cost and maintenance difficulties.

Mason, playwright Lanford Wilson, director Rob Thirkield, and actress Tanya Berezin, all of whom were veterans of the Caffe Cino. The plan was to establish a pool of artists -- actors, directors, playwrights and designers -- who would work together in the creation of plays. In 1974, The New York Times critic Mel Gussow acclaimed Circle Rep as the \\"chief provider of new American plays.\\" Marshall W.

Production Managers included Earl Hughes, Jody Boese, Kate Stewart and Karen Potosnak. Program In 1979 Circle Rep returned to their original concept of rotating rep, producing two plays in repertory; Hamlet, and Schiller's Mary Stuart. By 1982 Circle Rep had outgrown its theater and began to present some works on other stages. Running parallel to the classics, Circle Rep became celebrated for its productions of new plays, particularly those in the style that has been labeled \\"lyric realism,\\" with Lanford Wilson being the father of the genre. Marshall W. Mason directed dozens of Wilson's plays starting with Balm in Gilead in 1965, Home Free! and The Madness of Lady Bright in London (1968) and continuing at Circle Rep with Sextet (Yes) in 1971. Projects Circle Rep's developmental arm was the Circle Rep LAB. The LAB's Artistic Director was first Daniel Irvine, then Michael Warren Powell. At its height the Lab had over 300 active members(actors, writers directors and designers. Plays selected for this series received a week of rehearsal and a four-performance run. Several of the plays from the Circle Rep LAB went on to become major productions the following season or at other theaters, and including William M. Hoffman's As Is and Paula Vogel's The Baltimore Waltz. Michael Warren Powell became the artistic director of a successor company, Circle East, which continued the work of the LAB until Powell's death in 2016, and was then refashioned into the New Circle Theatre Company. The literary office of Circle Rep, headed by B. Rodney Marriott and followed by Milan Stitt, was one of the few that read unsolicited scripts and plays and responded with detailed criticism. To the end of developing scripts and plays, the company ran two reading series, Friday Readings and Extended Readings. The company collaborated with the Dramatists Guild on a series called Young Playwrights Festival, founded by Stephen Sondheim and Gerald Chapman in 1981. For the festival, ten plays with writers ranging from 8 to 18 were chosen for full production or staged readings. Plays were produced at Circle Rep with professional actors. Among the playwrights were Kenneth Lonergan and Jonathan Marc Sherman.

At one point in time the UWA's shows as the Toreo de Quatro Caminos arena were the biggest drawing shows in all of Mexico, putting the UWA in contention for being the biggest wrestling promotion in Mexico at the time. As a promoter Flores helped make such wrestlers as El Canek and El Hijo del Santo world-renowned wrestlers. Promotional career Flores started his career as a wrestling promoter as a minor promoter for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion. After working for EMLL for years he became frustrated with EMLL's very conservative approach to wrestling and wanted to promote his vision for wrestling instead of EMLL's vision. From 1974 to 1976 Flroes worked in World Wide Wrestling Federation. In 1975 Flores, along with Ray Mendoza broke away from EMLL and formed the rival Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). In the UWA Flores focused on featuring young wrestlers who were often not given a chance in EMLL, this included Ray Mendoza's sons Villano I, Villano II and Villano III. Villano III especially benefitted from Flores' way of promoting as he became one of the rising young stars in the mid to late 1970s. Flores and the UWA's promotion of El Canek made him a world wide wrestling star, boking him as the \\"Mexican defender\\" against a variety of foreign wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan and André the Giant. The UWA also helped give a young El Hijo del Santo his start in wrestling. The UWA flourished in the 1970s and 1980s but hit harder times in the 1990s and was forced to close down in 1995 after which Francisco Flores went into retirement.

Reconstructionism attempts to re- establish genuine polytheistic religions in the modern world through a rediscovery of the rituals, practices and contextual worldviews of pre- Christian Pagan religions. This method stands in contrast with other neopagan syncretic movements like Wicca, and ecstatic/esoteric movements like Germanic mysticism or Theosophy. While the emphasis on historical accuracy may imply historical reenactment, the difference between these two movements can be summarized as one of intent. Historical Reenactment seeks historical accuracy as a goal in and of itself. On the other hand, a Reconstructionist Neopagan views historical accuracy as a means to the end of establishing a harmonious relationship between a belief-community and the Gods. In short, the guiding principles of the Reconstructionist approach to the practice of Pre-Christian religion can be broken down as follows: # The pre-Christian Pagans had a harmonious relationship to their deities. # The rites and rituals of those Pagans were an essential part of the navigation and mediation of that relationship. # If modern-day Pagans wish to re-establish a harmonious relationship with these deities, then these rituals and rites must be properly performed. # To properly perform the rituals in the present day, modern Pagans must discover how and why they were performed in the past. The term \\"Reconstructionist Paganism\\" was likely coined by Isaac Bonewits in the late 1970s. Bonewits has said that he is not sure whether he \\"got this use of the term from one or more of the other culturally focused Neopagan movements of the time, or if [he] just applied it in a novel fashion.\\" Margot Adler later used the term \\"Pagan Reconstructionists\\" in the 1979 edition of Drawing Down the Moon to refer to Neopagans who endeavour to revive or \\"reconstruct\\" an authentic pre-Christian religious practice through use of historically verifiable research in fields such as: archeology, folklore studies and anthropology. This emphasis on reconstruction contrasts with the more syncretic, eclectic or occult approaches to Neopaganism, as seen for example in Thelema or Wicca.Adler, Margot (1979) Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today. Boston, Beacon Press . Chapter 9: Religions from the Past—The Pagan Reconstructionists. Reconstructionism within Greater Neopaganism Linzie (2004) enumerates the difference between modern reconstructionist polytheism, such as modern Hellenismos, and \\"classical\\" paganism as found in eighteenth to mid-twentieth century movements, including Germanic mysticism, early Neodruidism and Wicca. Aspects of the former, not found in the latter, are as follows: # There is no attempt to recreate a combined pan-European Paganism. # Researchers attempt to stay within research guidelines developed over the course of the past century for handling documentation generated in the time periods that they are studying. # A multi-disciplinary approach is utilized capitalizing on results from various fields as historical literary research, anthropology, religious history, political history, archaeology, forensic anthropology, historical sociology, etc. with an overt attempt to avoid pseudo-sciences. # There are serious attempts to recreate culture, politics, science and art of the period in order to better understand the environment within which the religious beliefs were practiced.Linzie (2004), 5f. Emphasis has been added to show that the recreation of pre-Christian social conditions are done so with the intent of understanding the religious practices and beliefs, not in order to recreate or revive a pre-Christian society either to replace modern society or to exist in parallel to modern society. The latter intention would be more indicative of a Traditionalist or a Historical Reenactment approach, and not specifically a Reconstructionist Neopagan. The goal of these methods is to create a set of rituals, rites and practices which facilitate a harmonious relationship between the Gods (and other good spirits like Landwights or others) and the belief-community. Reconstructionist Neopagans hope that this harmony both within the belief-community itself and between the Gods and the community brings \\"Peace and Plenty\\" (Ars Ok Friden). The use of the terms \\"Pagan\\" and \\"Neopagan\\" to refer to polytheistic reconstructionists is controversial. Some reconstructionist religious groups take great issue with being referred to as \\"Pagan\\" or \\"Neopagan,\\" viewing \\"Pagan\\" as a pejorative term. Even among those reconstructionist groups who see themselves as part of the broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, they may refuse the terms and their associations with the more problematic aspects of that community, such as eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures.

The resulting compromise laid down that if members of the Council representing between 23 votes (the old blocking minority threshold) and 26 votes (the new threshold) expressed their intention of opposing the taking of a decision by the Council by qualified majority, the Council will do all within its power, within a reasonable period of time, to reach a satisfactory solution that can be adopted by at least 68 votes out of 87. A declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam extended this compromise until the next enlargement took effect. The Ioannina compromise was superseded by the provisions of the Treaty of Nice.

Etymology Old English céapmann was the regular term for \\"dealer, seller\\", cognate with the Dutch koopman with the same meaning. Old English céap meant \\"deal, barter, business\\". The modern adjective cheap is a comparatively recent development from the phrase a good cheap, literally \\"a good deal\\" (cf. modern Dutch goedkoop = cheap). The word also appears in names such as Cheapside, Eastcheap and Chepstow: all markets or dealing places. The name of the Danish capital Copenhagen has a similar origin, being derived from Køpmannæhafn, meaning \\"merchants' harbour\\" or \\"buyer's haven\\". By 1600, the word chapman had come to be applied to an itinerant dealer in particular, but it remained in use for \\"customer, buyer\\" as well as \\"merchant\\" in the 17th and 18th centuries. The slang term for man, \\"chap\\" arose from the use of the abbreviated word to mean a customer, one with whom to bargain. The word was applied to hawkers of chapbooks, broadside ballads, and similar items. Their stock in trade provides a graphic insight into the methods of political and religious campaigners of the Civil War period, for example. Chapman is also a common personal name of the class derived from trades. Examples of use An instance of the use of the term is found in the opening lines of the poem Tam o' Shanter by Robert Burns: :Whan chapman billies leave the street :And drouthy neibours neibours meet... :\\"When trader comrades leave the street :And thirsty neighbours meet together...\\" See also *People with the name Chapman *Places and things named Chapman References *Oxford English Dictionary.

It is one of two through routes for I-35 through the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the other being I-35E through downtown Saint Paul. Traveling north, I-35 splits at Burnsville, and the I-35W route runs north for , carrying its own separate sequence of exit numbers. It runs through the city of Minneapolis before rejoining with I-35E to reform I-35 in Columbus near Forest Lake. I-35W supplanted sections of old U.S. Highway 8 (US 8) northeast of Minneapolis and old US 65 south of Minneapolis that have since been removed from the United States Numbered Highway System. During the early years of the Interstate Highway System, branching Interstates with directional suffixes such as N, S, E, and W were common nationwide. On every other Interstate nationwide, these directional suffixes have been phased out by redesignating the suffixed route numbers with a loop or spur route number designation. In the case of I-35 in the Twin Cities area, since neither branch is clearly the main route and both branches return to a unified Interstate beyond the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, officials at the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) have allowed the suffixes of E and W in Minnesota to remain in the present day. I-35 also splits into I-35E and I-35W in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, for similar reasons as the I-35 split in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. Route description I-35W approaching downtown Minneapolis from the south The southern terminus of I-35W is at Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul, I-35W heads north into Minneapolis. I-35W maintains a northbound direction in Burnsville with two lanes and adds a third lane at Burnsville Parkway. It then crosses the Minnesota River into Bloomington. At the Bloomington–Richfield city boundary, I-35W has a cloverleaf interchange with I-494. I-35W continues northbound into Richfield, where it turns east and joins with Minnesota State Highway 62 (MN 62) for about in what is locally known as the Crosstown Commons. I-35W and MN 62 split as two lanes of I-35W turn northbound toward downtown Minneapolis, where it adds back a third lane and then later a fourth and a fifth lane at the 46th Street on ramp. I-35W swerves slightly northeast immediately south of downtown to avoid the Washburn-Fair Oaks Mansion District. Three lanes then split north onto MN 65 (Old US 65), which exits into downtown. The two right-hand lanes of I-35W curve a sharp right east where it runs side by side with I-94 and US 52 for less than a mile, allowing drivers to exchange highways. Here, the interchange with I-94/US 52 does not have direct access for southbound I-35W to eastbound I-94/southbound US 52 or westbound I-94/northbound US 52 to northbound I-35W. Drivers must use the Cedar and Washington Avenue exits to make these connections. I-35W completes its eastern loop around downtown, and then crosses the Mississippi River on the St. Anthony Falls Bridge and winds northeast out of Northeast Minneapolis. Here, I-35W passes through industrial areas near the suburbs of St. Anthony, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Arden Hills. I-35W then meets I-694 in New Brighton and Arden Hills at a cloverleaf interchange. US 10 joins I-35W north of the I-35W/I-694 interchange. I-35W and US 10 run concurrently for another mile before the latter turns westward at Mounds View and Shoreview. I-35W passes next to the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant and again turns northeastward through the suburbs of Blaine and Lino Lakes. The communities of Lexington and Circle Pines are also nearby throughout this stretch. I-35W then merges with I-35E to re-form I-35 at Columbus near Forest Lake. I-35W carries its own set of exit numbers in the Twin Cities area, while I-35E continues the I-35 exit numbering scheme which goes between the Iowa state line and the city of Duluth. Legally, the route of I-35W is defined as part of unmarked Legislative Route 394 in the Minnesota Statutes §161.12(2), I-35W is not marked with this legislative number along the actual highway. History =Flooding= I-35W is prone to heavy-rain event flooding in several areas, intersecting both natural habitats including the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge between Burnsville and Bloomington; and the dense urban areas through the city of Minneapolis. In the great 1965 Minnesota River flood, the highway was under water in the flood plain wetlands south of the Minnesota River bridge at Burnsville. Dikes have been constructed and the highway road has been raised since then. The storm sewer system under I-35W in the urban core of south Minneapolis has also been cited as a place prone to flash floods during rain events. Improvements continue to be made to this area as part of future projects. =Minnesota River crossing= When the Minnesota River bridge between Burnsville and Bloomington was completed in 1960, it was two lanes in each direction. I-35W at the time only extended as far south as MN 13 in Burnsville. Improvements were made in 1984 to redeck and widen the bridge, but subsoil problems found at the north end resulted in the new lanes being temporarily closed. In 1989, the lanes were opened as high-occupancy vehicle lanes when the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) expanded the north approach to carry the additional traffic. =Mississippi River crossing= On August 1, 2007, the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River around 6:05 p.m. CDT, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The metal arch bridge had a length of approximately and a roadway height of over above the river. The bridge connected Minneapolis southwest of the Mississippi River to the Northeast Minneapolis neighborhood and served residents in the northern suburbs of the metro area. Because of the collapse of the bridge, I-35W traffic was temporarily detoured through eastbound I-94 to northbound MN 280 where it meets up with I-35W in Roseville. The replacement I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge was built in less than a year and opened to traffic on September 18, 2008, at 5:00 a.m. CDT, three months ahead of schedule. =I-35W and Highway 62 Crosstown Commons reconstruction project= A pre-construction photo of the Crosstown Commons junction. The two left lanes are I-35W northbound, while MN 62 enters via the ramp on the right. The Crosstown Commons is one of the most congested traffic interchanges in Minnesota. While it is sometimes referred to as an intersection, it is a merger or concurrency of I-35W and MN 62\\\\. The layout is not a typical intersection: there is only a single level of roadbed and it creates a dogleg in I-35W. This shared right-of-way intersection for I-35W and MN 62 has been a topic of political debate for many years. There are only six lanes on the commons and all drivers merging from one highway to the other are required to change at least one lane as they merge and then diverge again. The name comes from the fact that MN 62 is also known locally as the Crosstown Highway. The project to improve the interchange began in May 2007, after bids were received in April 2007. The new interchange features three through-lanes for I-35W in both directions, ending at 42nd Street, and two separate through-lanes for MN 62 in each direction, eliminating the need to weave across traffic. The cost of correcting the deficiencies in that short stretch of highway was estimated to be $285 million. In 2004, the City of Minneapolis threatened to withhold municipal consent for the project unless new bus lanes and bus stations were included. Lake Street currently has a bus station at grade with I-35W on both sides. Eventually the project was altered to include the desired additional bus access. The bid was won by the Ames, Lunda, and Schafer consortium for the 2007 cost of $288 million (equivalent to $ in ). The project included 25 new bridges, of highway, and expanded the total roadway width from six lanes to 12 lanes at Lyndale Avenue. The bridges were cast in Coates and trucked in for on-site erection. The new design includes transit/HOV lanes and was completed in November 2010. = 35W@94: Downtown to Crosstown = The 35W@94 Downtown to Crosstown Project is currently under construction to repave, and reconfigure I-35W and I-94. The work is taking place from 15th Street to 43rd Street on I-35W, and I-94 from Portland Avenue to 3rd Avenue in Minneapolis. The construction is adding a southbound entrance at County Road 3 (Lake Street), adding a northbound exit to 28th Street, and reconstructing and widening frontage roads to accommodate new ramps. HOV lanes using MnPASS are replacing the dynamic shoulder lanes in the center of the freeway. Retaining walls, noise barriers and bridges are being replaced throughout the entirety of the project. The future METRO Orange Line will use a new station at Lake Street, and a bus-only transit ramp on 12th Street connecting I-35W to downtown. The entire project will be completed in fall 2021.  Future  The proposed METRO Orange Line bus rapid transitway will run from the southern suburb of Lakeville to downtown Minneapolis on I-35W, passing through Burnsville, Bloomington, and Richfield.. It will use HOV lanes and a transit ramp into downtown Minneapolis.

It is one of several secondary schools that were founded by European or American missions in Turkey during the 19th century, but were then secularized after the founding of the modern Turkish Republic in 1923. Today, the school is subject to regulation by the Turkish Ministry of National Education, and almost its entire student body is Turkish, but a large part of its administrative and teaching staff remains Austrian (appointed by the Austrian Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture), and it offers a mixture of Turkish and Austrian curricula in a bilingual environment.  History  Sankt Georg was founded in 1882 by Austrian Lazarists and was originally intended for German-speaking Catholic children living in the Ottoman Empire. After the Ottoman (and Austrian) defeat in World War I, the school was ordered closed by the occupying Triple Entente forces in Istanbul, and all of its staff was sent back to Austria. The school was reopened shortly afterwards when the Republic of Turkey was founded (1923). After the annexation of Austria by the Nazi Germany in 1938, the school turned into a \\"German school\\" and it was closed once again in 1944, due to the freezing of relations between Turkey and Germany. It was reopened in 1947. In 1995, the girls' and boys' schools were merged.  Curriculum  The school combines both the Austrian and the Turkish curricula to prepare its students for the Turkish and Austrian school leaving examinations and to enrich their general knowledge. Under the current curriculum, students at Sankt Georg can learn up to three foreign languages. German and English are the two compulsory foreign languages taught at Sankt Georg. Aside from these two languages, students can choose either Latin or French as their third foreign language. Most subjects (including math, sciences, philosophy and arts) are taught in German by Austrian teachers, but subjects related to Turkish culture and language (such as Turkish literature, history and geography) are taught in Turkish by Turkish teachers. Students learn German in a compulsory one-year preparatory program.  School-leaving qualifications offered  * Turkish high school diploma (Lise diploması) * Austrian Matura: Students wishing to pursue their tertiary education at universities in Austria, or in the European Union, have the right to sit the Austrian Reifeprüfung examination at Sankt Georg. Once students pass the examination, they obtain the Matura certificate, which is equivalent to International Baccalaureate (IB).  School library  The current school library opened in 1988, after 2 small libraries within the school building were brought together. As of 2020, it contains more than 26,000 books, 20 periodicals/magazines in Turkish, German and English, and CDs/DVDs.  Alumni  Alumni of Sankt Georg gather every year in the last week of April at a re-union called \\"Strudeltag\\". Another annual re-union is organised around May in Vienna, which is intended for the graduates of Sankt Georg living/studying in Austria or in other European countries.

In this case \\"ham\\" is a misnomer since tasso is not made from the hind leg of a hog, but rather the hog's shoulder. This cut is typically fatty, and because the muscle is constantly used by the animal, has a great deal of flavor. The butt, which will weigh 7 to 8 pounds, is sliced across the grain into pieces about 3 in (7.5 cm) thick. These are dredged in a salt cure, which usually includes nitrites and sugar. The meat is left to cure briefly, only three or four hours, then rinsed, rubbed with a spice mixture containing cayenne pepper and garlic, and hot-smoked until cooked through. Though tasso may be eaten on its own, it is more often used as part of a flavor base for stews or braised vegetables. It is used in dishes ranging from pasta to crab cakes to soup and gravy. Appropriate to its roots, tasso is most often found in recipes of Cajun origin, such as jambalaya.

The body shows signs of having been murdered. Theories around the meanings and manner of his death vary. Condition and characteristics Only Clonycavan Man's head and torso are preserved. He was found in a modern peat harvesting machine, which was possibly responsible for the severing of his lower body. Scientific study of Clonycavan Man's hair has shed light on his diet leading up to his death. His diet was rich in vegetables and proteins, which indicates that he may have been killed during the warmer summer months of the year. Clonycavan Man was also fairly young at the time of his death; he is believed to have been in his early twenties. The most distinguishing feature of the man was his hairstyle, which was raised upon his head with the help of a \\"hair gel\\" of plant oil and pine resin, imported from south-western France or Northern Spain. Remnants of a hair tie was also found on the corpse. This may attest to trade between Ireland and southern Europe in the fourth and third centuries BCE, before Roman influence was brought to bear on the Celts of Iberia. This could also suggest that he was wealthy, as few others would have been able to buy imported cosmetics. The hairstyle was possibly a way to make the man appear taller, as examination of his remains suggests that he was only five feet two inches tall (157.48 cm). He had a squashed nose and crooked teeth. Pores are visible on the nose, and he had a thin beard. Death Facial reconstruction of the Clonycavan man, his hairstyle visible. Clonycavan Man is believed to have been murdered, based on an examination of the evidence found on his body by the Garda Technical Bureau (Irish Police Forensic Division). His skull looks to have been split open by a sharp implement. There is a deep wound on the top of his head, and parts of his brain have been found in this wound. There is also a large laceration across the bridge of his nose leading under his right eye. This is believed to be the blow that killed him. Both injuries seem to have been caused by the same sharp implement, most likely an axe. He was also disembowelled. The reasons for his death are unknown, but it is theorized by some that he was a ritual sacrifice of some type. His nipples and other body parts that consist of fragile tissue were missing, which could be from natural decomposition, or possibly mutilation; this has also led to at least one novel theory around the meanings of nipples. A hill that could possibly have been used for kingship ceremonies was near the bog where Clonycavan Man was found, leading to further speculation about the body. Radiocarbon dating has placed his death to between 392 BC and 201 BC, during the Iron Age of western Europe, making his remains around 2,300 years old.

The stadium, equipped with athletics facilities, is largest in the country, and is mostly used for football matches. As of March 2020, the stadium is ranked 210th in the list of association football stadiums by capacity.  History  Camille Chamoun Stadium in 1982; it was destroyed during the alt= Exterior view of the stadium in 2015 It was built in 1957 by the Lebanese Ministry of Youth & Fine Arts in the presidency of Camille Chamoun. The opening game was a friendly played against Energia Ploiești, where Lebanon won 1–0 through a goal scored by Joseph Abou Murad. The stadium was completely demolished in the Israeli Invasion of 1982. Consequently, former Lebanese PM Rafic Hariri initiated a project to rebuild the stadium in preparation for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup. The reconstruction received funding from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, with respective contributions of 20 million and 5 million U.S. dollars. The other 75 million U.S. dollars were provided by the Lebanese government. The renovation process of the bordering \\"Pierre Gemayel Hall\\" was also included in the overall project. Designed by Laceco Architects & Engineers, the stadium spans 50,000 square meters of space with 77,000 square meters of covering roofs and seven kilometers of fences. A presidential gallery of 37 seats towers over the pitch, fenced off by bullet-proof glass. In addition to a 600 square meter parking lot was built underneath the stadium and another 20,000 square meter lot outside. The structure is capable of absorbing earthquakes up to 8.6 degree on the Richter scale. Moreover, administration offices, a complex for Lebanon’s Olympic committee and various other sports federations, ultra-modern press centers, clinics to handle emergencies among players and spectators with a parking lot for ambulances and fire engines, have been built beneath the stands. An indoors sports complex north to the stadium was built with a 3,300 strong spectator capacity for basketball, volleyball and gymnastics, which was scheduled to be completed by 1998. Kvarner, the contracting company, said that 25 British and 115 Lebanese engineers toiled along with 850 Lebanese and Arab workers to rebuild the sports city that was originally inaugurated by the late president Camille Chamoun in 1957. After the reconstruction, the stadium hosted the 1997 Pan Arab Games where the Lebanese president Elias Hrawi delivered an opening speech saying: \\"From Lebanon we say to the world; the Lebanese have returned to their heritage and unity, they have returned to build a Lebanon for heroes, youth and peace\\". The Lebanese PM also delivered a speech saying: \\"Construction won over destruction, and peace over war\\". Finally, the president of the Pan Arab Committee said: \\"This is a tournament of solidarity between the Lebanese people who have established credibility in their country and given rise to this great sporting event\\". \\"Bombs can destroy a city but can never shake the faith of believers\\". The stadium was also the main venue for the 1999 Arab Athletics Championships, the 2000 Asian Cup, and the sixth Jeux de la Francophonie held from September 27 to October 3 of 2009. On 27 April 2017, it hosted a Barcelona Legends vs Real Madrid Legends game, which ended 3–2 to Barcelona.

Featuring series regulars Delta Burke and veteran Reid Shelton, it was one of cable's first attempts to lure the lucrative sitcom audience away from the \\"Big Three\\", by taking advantage of their freedom to include occasional cursing and nudity. Plot The sports-themed series follows the on-and off-field antics of the fictional American football team, the California Bulls. The team changed owners throughout the series' history, with the premise that a woman is in charge. During the first season Diane Barrow (Delta Burke) becomes the owner of her ex-husband's team as part of a divorce settlement, after he has an affair with the team's tight end. She quickly learns the ups and downs of pro football. In one episode, she is forced to coach the team herself after the head coach, Ernie Denardo, is placed in the hospital. She also has constant battles with her General Manager/husband's nephew, who has dealings with the local mob, and fights off advances made by her quarterback played by Geoffrey Scott. The second season dealt with two themes: training camp and the playoffs. Barrow was dealing with her players taking recreational drugs during training camp. During this season, O. J. Simpson joined the cast as T.D. Parker, a veteran running back who is forced to make the transition from player to coach. Two real-life football stars made cameo appearances. Marcus Allen portrayed a rookie who was taking over T.D.'s spot on the team. And Vince Ferragamo played \\"Mainstreet\\" Manneti, a veteran quarterback. Jason Beghe joined the cast to play Tom Yinessa, a walk-on quarterback who deals with his overnight celebrity. Delta Burke left the show midway through the third season, after committing herself to CBS' Designing Women, which she had begun starring on in 1986, and which was renewed. Diane loses control of the Bulls to Teddy Schraeder, her former lover, who manipulates everyone to his own ends. His antics include having T.D. fire Ernie as coach, Yinessa practice without a contract, and ignoring the steroids that John Matuszak's character is using. Legal issues force him to leave the country and turn control over to his daughter, played by Leah Ayres. Season 4 was briefly renamed 1st and Ten: The Bulls Mean Business. Shanna Reed joins the cast as the team's new female president, representing the new owners, the Dodds Corporation. Her attempts to innovate include bringing a female soccer player in to kick, and signing an Olympic sprinter as wide receiver. Joe Namath has a cameo appearance. Shannon Tweed would replace her in Season 5, and remain with the show to the end. The show was renamed 1st and Ten: Do it Again for the fifth season. The final season was 1st and Ten: In Your Face. Series themes * The Bulls somehow manage to make it to the championship football game, yet lose in a controversial, heartbreaking manner. * Mad Dog and Dr. Death haze the rookies and rally the defense. * Bubba and Jethro help each other with their various (often sex-related) mishaps. Bubba's voracious appetite is also a running gag * The volatile ownership position of the franchise. * Controversial aspects of professional sports in the late 1980s: steroids, the instant replay, women in the locker room, the role of free agency, multi-sport stars, endorsements. Game footage Footage was used from USFL's Los Angeles Express. During simulated game shots, the Bulls football helmet has a decal of horns on the side. When the show uses actual game footage, you can clearly see the letters \\"L\\" and \\"A\\" on the helmets side, representing the L.A. Express. The Bulls quarterbacks wore #14 to match the actual game footage of L.A. Express real- life quarterback Tom Ramsey. Many generic shots of USFL stadiums were used to depict where the Bulls were playing. As the series went on, aerial shots were used of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to represent the Bulls home stadium. Game footage from the USFL stopped midway through the third season, as scripted football plays were being used instead, and the USFL had ceased operations by that point. At one point, Denardo suggests trading for a running back. He mentions the Bulls from \\"that other league.\\" He was talking about the Jacksonville Bulls from the United States Football League. Characters Only Donald Gibb, Cliff Frazier, Prince Hughes, and Reid Shelton appeared in all six seasons. John Kassir and O. J. Simpson joined the cast the second season and stayed till the show's end. * Diane Barrow: Delta Burke * Ellen: Mariann Aalda * Frederick 'Miracle Miles' Coolidge: Keith Amos * Dr. Doc Phillips: Jim Antonio * Jill Schrader: Leah Ayres * Tom Yinessa: Jason Beghe * Johnny Valentine: Sam J.

The majority of episodes on the \\"Complete Collection\\" DVD are the syndicated versions.HBO Classics: 1ST & TEN The original opening credits showed former professional football player Fran Tarkenton introducing the players and the plot points at the beginning of each episode. Completely different closing credits were originally used, too. They showed credits rolling over scenes from the episode.

Its founder was a young charismatic woman named Beatriz Kimpa Vita who said she was possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua.Peter N. Stearns and William Leonard Langer. The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged, 2001. Page 394.John Thornton, The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706 (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998) Beatriz became known for healing and other miracles. It was eventually suppressed by King Pedro IV of Kongo, and Dona Beatriz was burned at the stake as a heretic. Origins Dona Beatriz (the Baptismal name of Kimpa Vita) was a young indigenous noblewoman born around 1684 in the Kongo. The Kingdom of Kongo was the largest and most powerful kingdom in Central Africa, but its influence was waning; during the 17th century, Portugal became the dominant military and economic force in the region. The Portuguese had begun converting the people of the Kongo to Catholicism as early as the 15th century. The nobility of the Kongo and the commoners both practised Catholicism. Roman Catholicism had been introduced to Sub-Saharan Africa in the 15th century and had attracted a wide following in Kongo. Beatriz claimed Anthony had told her through a vision to create a new Kongolese Catholicism, and she incorporated various native practices and traditions into her movement. The major differences between Roman Catholicism and Antonianism were the rejection of the cross, as it was seen as being responsible for Christ's death, as well as the rejection of baptism, confession and prayer. Among her beliefs were that Jesus was a black man and that the Kongo was the real home of Christianity. She also held that heaven was for Africans. After an illness in 1704, Dona Beatriz began to preach that she had been possessed by St. Anthony of Padua, who was a major Portuguese saint. Teachings Dona Beatriz \\"was trained as an nganga marinda, an individual who consults the supernatural world to solve problems within the community\\", and acted as a medium, speaking the pronouncements of St. Anthony. The teachings were a mixture of Kongo religious rituals, nativism, and Catholicism: Dona Beatriz prophesied a new golden age to her followers, one that would follow the end of European presence in the Kongo. European treasures would be found around the Kongo capital city of Mbanza Kongo by her followers, and trees would turn to silver and gold. Dona Beatriz acknowledged papal authority, yet her cult was hostile to European missionaries, teaching that they were \\"corrupt and unsympathetic to the spiritual needs of Kongolese Catholics\\". Political activities and suppression The Antonians, led by Dona Beatriz, occupied the territory of Mbanza Kongo. It served as a base for Antonian missionaries, who were sent by Dona Beatriz to convert followers to her movement, and \\"to urge rulers of the divided Kongo territories to unite under one king\\". Her aims were to end the civil wars that had plagued the kingdom since the arrival of the Portuguese. Dona Beatriz' political influence was a threat to Pedro IV and the Portuguese administration that supported him. In 1706, Pedro IV had Dona Beatriz arrested and burned at the stake for heresy, under the urging of Portuguese Capuchin monks. The movement of Antonianism did not immediately die when she did and in 1708 twenty thousand Antonians marched on King Pedro IV, who eventually defeated them and restored his kingdom.Bentley, Jerry and Ziegler, Herb. Traditions & Encounters: A Global Perspective on the Past. McGraw Hill, New York: 2006 Although the movement had a short life under the leadership of Dona Beatriz, artifacts have survived, including St. Anthony figurines made of \\"ivory, brass, and wood ... affixed to crosses, used as staff finials, and worn as pendants.... these images, called Toni Malau or \\"Anthony of good fortune\\" in KiKongo, served to guard their bearers against illness and other misfortunes\\".

The building was initially a rowing club and was later converted into the restaurant. Joe's Crab Shack opened its first location in Houston, Texas in 1991. Landry's Restaurants, Inc. purchased the original Joe's in Houston in early 1994 to convert it into a Landry's Restaurant. By 1995 the chain had grown to three locations in Houston and one in Dallas. On November 17, 2006, Joe's was sold to J.H. Whitney & Company, a privately held company, operating as JCS Holdings, LLC. The sales price was $192 million including the assumption of liabilities of $225 million. JCS Holdings changed their name to Ignite Restaurant Group in April 2009 and operated the 130 existing Joe's and 26 Brickhouse Tavern and Tap restaurants. Ignite Restaurant Group went public in 2012. The company was headquartered on Westpark Drive near the Westchase District of Houston. Ignite Restaurant Group filed for bankruptcy protection on June 6, 2017 and was re-acquired by Landry's, Inc. in August 2017 at bankruptcy auction for $57 million.

It was operational from 1939 until 1957. The site of the station is now occupied by Manchester Airport. Prewar years Manchester's first municipal airfield was Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome (open from April 1929), and then Barton Aerodrome (open from January 1930) just west of Eccles. Barton Aerodrome was planned to be the main airport for Manchester, but it became clear by 1934 that its small boggy grass airfield was inadequate for the larger airliners then coming into service including the Douglas DC-2 and DC-3. A new airport site at Ringway, eight miles south of Manchester city centre, was selected from several alternatives, and this was to become the site of the RAF station by early 1940. Construction of the all-grass airfield began in late 1935, and the first (westerly) portion opened in June 1937 for use by Fairey Aviation. The remaining airfield areas and the terminal building were opened for public use on 25 June 1938. Initially known as Manchester (Ringway) Airport, then Manchester International Airport, from 1986 it has been designated simply Manchester Airport. Second World War Construction of a Royal Air Force station, including two large hangars, workshops, barrack blocks and ancillary accommodation, began in the northeast corner of the airport during spring 1939, with phased completion during early 1940. One of the hangars was intended for use by No. 613 (City of Manchester) Squadron, but this unit had been moved south at the outbreak of war. RAF Ringway was therefore initially used by No. 1 Operational Training Unit, RAF Coastal Command. Paratroopers from the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion undergoing physical training with No. 1 Parachute Training School at Ringway, with a Whitley III in foreground, August 1942 From June 1940, Ringway became the wartime base for No.1 Parachute Training School RAF, which was charged with the initial training of all allied paratroopers trained in Europe (60,000) and for development of parachute drops of equipment; also the development of military gliding operations. Men and women agents of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) were also trained to jump. Comedian Frank Muir, spent several years at the school in the photographic section taking slow motion film of jumps on a project intended to decrease the frequency of parachutes failing (sometimes called \\"Roman Candle\\"). He recalled the Special Operations Executive training centre, housed in an Edwardian house on the outskirts of the airfield, where he was assigned to take pictures of the agents for identity documents. There was an additional SOE holding centre in a large house in nearby Bowdon. No.14 Ferry Pilot Pool of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) was based at Ringway between 1940 and 1945. The veteran ATA aircrews delivered many thousands of military aircraft to operational units which had been built, modified or repaired at Ringway, Woodford, Barton and at other northwest aircraft factories and airfields. Over 4,400 warplanes were built at Ringway by Fairey Aviation and Avro. The aircraft included the Fairey Battle, Fairey Fulmar, Fairey Barracuda, Bristol Beaufighter, Handley Page Halifax and Fairey Gannet. Avro's experimental department, located in Ringway's 1938-built northside hangar between mid-1939 and late 1945, completed the prototype Avro Manchester bomber. This was followed in January 1941 by the prototype of the famous Avro Lancaster bomber. The last warplane prototype to be assembled here was the Avro Lincoln bomber which first flew from Ringway on 9 July 1944. Avro built over 100 Avro York military transport aircraft in the three 1941/42 southside hangars. Two hangars built in the NW corner of the airfield during 1939/40 for use by Fairey Aviation remain in use, one for aircraft maintenance and the other for ground operations. The other three wartime hangars built for Fairey's were demolished during the 1990s. No. 613 (City of Manchester) Squadron had its home base at RAF Ringway during 1939 and again from 1946 to 1957 when it flew Supermarine Spitfires and de Havilland Vampire jet fighters in its fighter role as a unit within the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Post war On the disbandment of 613 Squadron (and all other Royal Auxiliary Air Force Squadrons) in March 1957, RAF Ringway was closed and its hangars and other buildings handed over for civil airline operations including cargo and maintenance. The two 1939/40-built hangars remained in use until late 1995, when they were demolished to permit construction of the new Terminal 3. By January 2009, the only surviving building from RAF Ringway was the Officers Mess (Building 217) in Ringway Road and until recently used as the Airport Archive. It was still standing, but disused, in November 2011. It was later demolished to make way for a further extension of car parking facilities. Memorials and monuments A garden outside Olympic House (near Terminal 1) houses several carved stone memorials to the wartime units based at Ringway and to 613 Squadron. There is a monument, formerly in Terminal 1 but now in Manchester Airport railway station, to Alcock and Brown, the pioneers of transatlantic flight; of them, John Alcock was born in Old Trafford, near Barton Airport.

Aloe variegata), also known as tiger aloe and partridge-breasted aloe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asphodelaceae. It is an evergreen succulent perennial indigenous to South Africa and Namibia. It is common in cultivation. Description Plants grow to around 20–30 cm, with 18–24 leaves arranged in three ranks. New leaves appear individually over time from the centre of the plant, flattening older leaves and pushing them outward in a spiral fashion. Each leaf is a rich green colour with irregular light green banding made up of amalgamated, slightly raised oval spots, and similarly light coloured fine serrations along each edge. In mature plants the outer, and thus oldest, leaves are 10–15 cm long and approximately 3–6 cm broad at the base. Depending on trauma, space, water availability or even old age, outer leaves will die off, turning golden brown and shriveling away. Plants reach maturity in three to seven years, again largely dependent on the space, sunlight and water available, at which point they will begin to send out racemes of flowers. Flowers develop in a cluster at the head of the raceme and are spaced out by its rapid growth. 1801 plate depicting Gonialoe variegata The flowers are orange, arranged in a raceme of around 20–30 cm in height. In its natural habitat in southern Africa, flowers are produced from July to September, with offsets being readily formed. Cultivation In temperate regions it can be grown outdoors during the summer months. However it does not tolerate cold below or wet conditions, and requires the protection of glass in winter. In cultivation in the UK this plant gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit in 1993. Taxonomy G. variegata was formerly part of the Serrulatae series of very closely related Aloe species, together with Aloe dinteri and Aloe sladeniana. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown these three species to possibly constitute an entirely separate genus, with the name Gonialoe. While this species looks rather similar to its two sister species, it can easily be distinguished from them by its shorter, stouter inflorescence with larger pink flowers.Reynolds, G. W. 1950. The aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town. Distribution and habitat Gonialoe variegata distribution, in yellow. The tiger aloe is indigenous to the arid Karoo region of southern Africa. In South Africa, it is found in the dry areas of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Free State. It generally grows in rocky terrain and outcrops where they may grow between boulders, but may also grow in soils with sharp drainage, such as sandy soils. It is usually found in the semi-shade shelter of either rock crevices or shrubs, which provide some protection from the sun. This species predominates in winter-rainfall areas. To the north, as the climate gradually changes to a summer rainfall one, this species is replaced by its sister species Gonialoe sladeniana (in the intermediate rainfall region) which then gradually makes way for Gonialoe dinteri in the summer rainfall areas of far northern Namibia. History The first record of this species was an account in the diary of Simon van der Stel (the first Governor of the Cape), when he travelled in 1685 to Namaqualand in the Northern Cape. In addition, this was one of the species cultivated in the Dutch East India Company's garden in Cape Town in 1695.Van Wyk, B-E. & Smith, G.F. (1996) Guide to aloes of South Africa Briza Publications, Pretoria. Ecology Since Aloe flowers are usually reddish in colour, sunbirds are attracted to them for the nectar they produce, and are likely the plant's main pollinators. Other creatures which visit flowers are usually insects such as bees, wasps, beetles and ants.Leistner, O.A.

Life and career Lennie Lee is a British artist born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He moved to the UK in 1960. He was educated at Dulwich college in London before winning a scholarship to study philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1983, he took up painting. Soon after, he moved to East London where he became interested in the urban dereliction left over from the Second World War. In 1984 he occupied several disused buildings and, together with a number of artists including South African painter, Beezy Bailey, he began to make site-specifichttp://bak.spc.org/luna-nera/art- site/artsite_book/NOGRAFIK/1.pdf installations using found material. From the mid-1980s he joined various underground art collectives including the ARC group, a London-based collective of international artists, influenced by Kurt Schwitters, who specialized in building site-specific installation art. From 1987 to 1991, he worked together with the ARC group until it was finally disbanded in November 1991 in Budapest. After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Lee was offered a number of exhibitions in East and West Berlin. While working on a series of outdoor sculptural installations in the summer of 1990, he was invited to work at the Kunst Haus Tacheles in Berlin, where he made contact with the thriving Berlin underground scene. On his return to London in the winter of 1990 he began to make a series of performances, mostly on the theme of taboo, the first of which took place at the ARC in London's Balls Pond Road. Through this, Lee was introduced to members of the KULE group, a radical theatre collective based in Berlin who invited him to come and stay in August Strasse 10 in the winter of 1990. There, together with performance artist Nils Duemcke, he set up a weekly cabaret. In the same year he painted large-scale banners for the Mutoid Waste Company. After returning to London, he set up a new art collective known as the 'Department of Hate and Social Sickness', (DHSS) in spring 1992. The DHSS continued to make installations and performances in underground venues throughout London until it was disbanded in the spring of 1994. That same year, in collaboration with Ian Stenhouse and Mark Bishop, Lee set up the Rich and famous gallery in the heart of London's East End showing work by a number of artists including Martin Maloney, David Burrows, Mark Divo, Ingo Giezendanner, Graham Nicholls, Dan Jones, Tod Hanson, Lee Campbell, Daniel Fernandez, David Mccairley Ian Stenhouse, Gini Simpson, Trevor Knaggs and Stefanie Maas. In winter 1994, Lee once again moved to Berlin where he organised a series of performances in the theatre space at the Kunst Haus Tacheles in Berlin. There he became involved with a group of radical artists from Zurich including Mark Divo and Ingo Giezendanner and from 1995 onwards was repeatedly invited by them to take part in a series of art projects throughout Europe including Divo's important show at the 'Escherwyssplatz' in Zurich in 1995, the infamous Cabaret Voltaire Zurich in 2002, \\\\- the 'Sihlpapierfabrik', Zurich in 2003 and the 'Real Biennale', Prague in 2005 and 'Process', Prague in 2006. \\\\- In the late 1990s Lee made a series of performances and installations for the art collective, Hydra. Between 1996 and 2002 Lee worked together with Gustavo Aguerre and Ingrid Falk, mainly in Sweden. In 2003 Lee was invited by Gillian McIver to join 'Luna Nera', an art collective producing site-specific installations. Since 2000 Lee has concentrated mainly on performance art, video art, digital photography and installation art. He has exhibited in a number of UK institutions including the Barbican Art Centre, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Tate gallery and the Third Eye Centre in Glasgow.

Flannery, John Uri Lloyd: The Great American Eclectic, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1998. He also wrote novels set in northern Kentucky. His most popular novel was the science fiction or allegorical Etidorhpa, or, the end of the earth: the strange history of a mysterious being and the account of a remarkable journey (1895). First distributed privately, it was later illustrated and printed in eighteen editions. Translated into seven languages, it was widely read in Europe as well as the United States. Life and career John Uri Lloyd was born in upstate New York to teachers Sophia Webster and Nelson Marvin Lloyd. His family relocated to Florence and Petersburg in northern Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1853. Lloyd took an apprenticeship with the chemist William J.M. Gordon when he was 14 years old and later apprenticed with George Eger. His younger brothers Nelson Ashley Lloyd (1851–1926) and Curtis Gates Lloyd (1859–1926) also became chemists. During 1886 the brothers bought the Merrell and Thorpe Company, renaming it Lloyd Brothers, Pharmacists, Inc. John Lloyd's innovations include a \\"cold still\\" for plant extractions and the first buffered alkaloid (made with hydrous aluminium silicate), called alcresta. In 1919, Lloyd and his two brothers established trusts to fund the Lloyd Library and Museum. Today it is considered by many to house the finest collections in the world devoted to eclectic medicine, medical botany and pharmacy. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the eclectic medicine movement was popular, which incorporated the use of medical botany. The movement led to the founding of associated medical schools, including the Eclectic Medical Institute, first located in Worthington in 1833, which later moved to Cincinnati where it had students from 1845 to 1939. After Lloyd's death in 1936, S.B. Penick bought the Lloyd Brothers firm in 1938. In 1960, the German pharmaceutical manufacturer Hoechst AG purchased the operations. In 2013, the American company Eli Lilly and Company bought Hoechst AG. Writings Lloyd combined his interests by writing a series of local description novels about the northern Kentucky area. His most popular and influential work was Etidorhpa (1895), a scientific allegory that some consider a work of science fiction. It was part of what are called the genre of \\"Hollow Earth\\" novels, based on a journey to the interior of the earth and another world. He first distributed the book privately. When it was printed commercially, illustrations by J. Augustus Knapp were added. It ran to eighteen editions and was translated into seven languages.

In those 4 games, he went 0–1, giving up 10 hits and 7 runs in 5.2 innings. =Sugar Land Skeeters= On July 25, 2013, Pauley signed with the independent Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 12 starts, he went 5–3 with a 3.44 ERA, striking out 52 in 68 innings. He became a free agent after the 2014 season. Pitching style Pauley is a sinkerball pitcher, and as such his success relies on his ability to keep the ball down in the strike zone, and when contact is made, to get ground-ball outs. Pauley also has the standard fastball, curveball, and changeup in his repertoire. His fastball hits the high 80 MPH range and his curveball has more of a sweeping motion than the standard 12-to-6 movement seen from most minor-league pitchers.

It was introduced by the philosopher and logician Willard Van Orman Quine in his book Mathematical Logic, originally published in 1940. Put simply, quasi- quotation enables one to introduce symbols that stand for a linguistic expression in a given instance and are used as that linguistic expression in a different instance. For example, one can use quasi-quotation to illustrate an instance of substitutional quantification, like the following: ::\\"Snow is white\\" is true if and only if snow is white. ::Therefore, there is some sequence of symbols that makes the following sentence true when every instance of φ is replaced by that sequence of symbols: \\"φ\\" is true if and only if φ. Quasi-quotation is used to indicate (usually in more complex formulas) that the φ and \\"φ\\" in this sentence are related things, that one is the iteration of the other in a metalanguage. Quine introduced quasiquotes because he wished to avoid the use of variables, and work only with closed sentences (expressions not containing any variables). However, he still needed to be able to talk about sentences with arbitrary predicates in them, and thus, the quasiquotes provided the mechanism to make such statements. Quine had hoped that, by avoiding variables and schemata, he would minimize confusion for the readers, as well as staying closer to the language that mathematicians actually use.Preface to the 1981 Revised Edition. Quasi-quotation is sometimes denoted using the symbols ⌜ and ⌝ (unicode U+231C, U+231D), or double square brackets, ⟦ ⟧ (\\"Oxford brackets\\"), instead of ordinary quotation marks.Dowty, D., Wall, R. and Peters, S.: 1981, Introduction to Montague semantics, Springer.Scott, D. and Strachey, C.: 1971, Toward a mathematical semantics for computer languages, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, Programming Research Group.  How it works  Quasi-quotation is particularly useful for stating formation rules for formal languages. Suppose, for example, that one wants to define the well-formed formulas (wffs) of a new formal language, L, with only a single logical operation, negation, via the following recursive definition: # Any lowercase Roman letter (with or without subscripts) is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. # If φ is a well-formed formula (wff) of L, then '~φ' is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. # Nothing else is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. Interpreted literally, rule 2 does not express what is apparently intended. For '~φ' (that is, the result of concatenating '~' and 'φ', in that order, from left to right) is not a well-formed formula (wff) of L, because no Greek letter can occur in well-formed formulas (wffs), according to the apparently intended meaning of the rules. In other words, our second rule says \\"If some sequence of symbols φ (for example, the sequence of 3 symbols φ = '~~p') is a well-formed formula (wff) of L, then the sequence of 2 symbols '~φ' is a well-formed formula (wff) of L\\". Rule 2 needs to be changed so that the second occurrence of 'φ' (in quotes) be not taken literally. Quasi-quotation is introduced as shorthand to capture the fact that what the formula expresses isn't precisely quotation, but instead something about the concatenation of symbols. Our replacement for rule 2 using quasi-quotation looks like this: :2'. If φ is a well-formed formula (wff) of L, then ⌜~φ⌝ is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. The quasi-quotation marks '⌜' and '⌝' are interpreted as follows. Where 'φ' denotes a well-formed formula (wff) of L, '⌜~φ⌝' denotes the result of concatenating '~' and the well-formed formula (wff) denoted by 'φ' (in that order, from left to right). Thus rule 2' (unlike rule 2) entails, e.g., that if 'p' is a well-formed formula (wff) of L, then '~p' is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. Similarly, we could not define a language with disjunction by adding this rule: :2.5. If φ and ψ are well- formed formulas (wffs) of L, then '(φ v ψ)' is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. But instead: :2.5'. If φ and ψ are well-formed formulas (wffs) of L, then ⌜(φ v ψ)⌝ is a well-formed formula (wff) of L. The quasi-quotation marks here are interpreted just the same. Where 'φ' and 'ψ' denote well-formed formulas (wffs) of L, '⌜(φ v ψ)⌝' denotes the result of concatenating left parenthesis, the well-formed formula (wff) denoted by 'φ', space, 'v', space, the well- formed formula (wff) denoted by 'ψ', and right parenthesis (in that order, from left to right). Just as before, rule 2.5' (unlike rule 2.5) entails, e.g., that if 'p' and 'q' are well-formed formulas (wffs) of L, then '(p v q)' is a well-formed formula (wff) of L.  A caution  It does not make sense to quantify into quasi-quoted contexts using variables that range over things other than character strings (e.g. numbers, people, electrons). Suppose, for example, that one wants to express the idea that 's(0)' denotes the successor of 0, 's(1)' denotes the successor of 1, etc. One might be tempted to say: * If φ is a natural number, then ⌜s(φ)⌝ denotes the successor of φ. Suppose, for example, φ = 7. What is ⌜s(φ)⌝ in this case? The following tentative interpretations would all be equally absurd: # ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(7)', # ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(111)' (in the binary system, '111' denotes the integer 7), # ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(VII)', # ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(seven)', # ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(семь)' ('семь' means 'seven' in Russian), # ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(the number of days in one week)'. On the other hand, if φ = '7', then ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(7)', and if φ = 'seven', then ⌜s(φ)⌝ = 's(seven)'. The expanded version of this statement reads as follows: * If φ is a natural number, then the result of concatenating 's', left parenthesis, φ, and right parenthesis (in that order, from left to right) denotes the successor of φ. This is a category mistake, because a number is not the sort of thing that can be concatenated (though a numeral is). The proper way to state the principle is: * If φ is an Arabic numeral that denotes a natural number, then ⌜s(φ)⌝ denotes the successor of the number denoted by φ. It is tempting to characterize quasi-quotation as a device that allows quantification into quoted contexts, but this is incorrect: quantifying into quoted contexts is always illegitimate. Rather, quasi-quotation is just a convenient shortcut for formulating ordinary quantified expressions—the kind that can be expressed in first-order logic. As long as these considerations are taken into account, it is perfectly harmless to \\"abuse\\" the corner quote notation and simply use it whenever something like quotation is necessary but ordinary quotation is clearly not appropriate.

Based at times in both Birmingham and London, she was a significant member of the Birmingham Surrealists and of the London-based British Surrealist Group, and was an important link between the surrealists of the two cities.EMMY BRIDGWATER (1906-99) Modern British Surrealist The Leicester Galleries, London Michel Remy, professor of art history at the University of Nice and author of Surrealism in Britain, describes her influence as \\"of the same importance to British surrealism as the arrival of Dalí in the ranks of the French surrealists\\".. Biography Emmy Bridgwater was born in the upmarket Edgbaston district of Birmingham, the third daughter of a chartered accountant and Methodist. Showing an early interest in painting and drawing, she studied under Bernard Fleetwood-Walker at the Birmingham School of Art for three years from 1922 before further study at a local art school in Oxford paid for by work as a secretary.. Emmy Bridgwater, Necessary Bandages (1942), oil on panelBridgwater's aesthetic direction was transformed by attending the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936, where she met Conroy Maddox, John Melville and Robert Melville - the key figures of the Birmingham Surrealists. From this point on her work began to explore the more fearful sides of the subconscious, often using automatist techniques.Obituary: Emmy Bridgwater Jeremy Jenkinson, The Independent, 26 May 1999 Studying for periods at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in London during 1936 and 1937 she retained a base in Birmingham and exhibited as a member of the Birmingham Group throughout the late 1930s, also exhibiting at the London Gallery after being introduced to owner E. L. T. Mesens by Robert Melville. In early 1940, she joined the British Surrealist Group when Conroy Maddox and Robert Melville officially introduced her to them. She was to attend their meetings for much of the following decade. Forming a close friendship with Edith Rimmington and having a brief but intense affair with Toni del Renzio, she contributed to numerous international surrealist publications (including del Renzio's Arson: an ardent review) and held her first solo exhibition at Jack Bilbo's Modern Gallery in 1942. In 1947, Bridgwater was one of six English artists chosen by André Breton to exhibit at the Exposition Internationale du Surrealisme at the Galerie Maeght in Paris - the last major international surrealist group exhibition. By the late 1940s, however, Bridgwater was having to spend increasing amounts of time caring for her ageing mother and disabled sister. In 1953, she moved to Stratford-upon-Avon to take on this responsibility full- time and effectively suspended her artistic career. During the 1970s Bridgwater resumed work, largely in collage, and her earlier work featured in numerous surrealist retrospective exhibitions over the following decades.Emmy Bridgwater, Biographical Information The Surrealism Server, 1994-1996 Ceasing work in the mid-1980s, she died in Solihull in 1999. Work Emmy Bridgwater's work in the 1930s and 1940s largely consisted of paintings and pen and ink drawings. Her personal iconography often featured organic imagery such as birds, eggs, leaves, fruit and tendril-like automatist lines depicted with a sense of \\"surrealist black humour and violence\\", often within a dreamlike landscape. From the 1970s onwards she also worked in collage. Critical reaction Emmy Bridgwater, Night Work is About to Commence (1943), Oil on board.In Arson: an ardent review Toni del Renzio wrote of Bridgwater's paintings: \\"We do not see these pictures. We hear their cries and are moved by them. Our own entrails are drawn painfully from us and twisted into the pictures whose significance we did not want to realise.\\" Robert Melville described Bridgwater's paintings as depicting \\"the saddening, half-seen 'presences' encountered by the artist on her journey through the labyrinths of good and evil ... although they are dreamlike in their ambiguity they are realistic documents from a region of phantasmal hopes and murky desires where few stay to observe and fewer still remain clear-sighted.\\" Her obituary in The Independent said \\"Her paintings show an ability to enter a personal dream world and transform the visions she experienced there into bold, unselfconscious, emotionally charged landscapes which more often than not strike into the very depths of one's mind. Using a limited palette and painting thickly, she was able to bring together seemingly unrelated objects which she used to fill desolate landscapes, giving the paintings a narrative quality of her own making.\\" Exhibitions Emmy Bridgwater, Untitled (1941), Pen and ink on paper * 1937 - The Birmingham Group, Lucy Wertheim Gallery, London * 1938 - The Birmingham Group, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham * 193? - London Gallery, London * 1939 - As We See Ourselves, Chapman Galleries, Birmingham * 1942 - Emmy Bridgwater (Solo Exhibition), Modern Gallery, London * 1947 - Coventry Art Circle Exhibition, Coventry * 1947 - Exposition Internationale du Surrealisme, Galerie Maeght, Paris * 1948 - Coventry Art Circle Exhibition, Coventry * 1949 - Birmingham Artists Committee Invitation Exhibition, Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, Birmingham * 1951 - Coventry Art Circle Exhibition, Coventry * 1971 - Britain's Contribution to Surrealism of the 30s and 40s, Hamet Gallery, London * 1982 - Peinture Surrealiste en Angleterre 1930-1960: Les Enfants d'Alice, Galerie 1900-2000, Paris * 1985 - A Salute to British Surrealism 1930-1950, The Minories, Colchester; Blond Fine Art, London and Ferens Art Gallery, Hull * 1985 - British Woman Surrealists, Blond Fine Art, London * 1986 - Surrealism in England 1936 and after, Herbert Read Gallery, Canterbury * 1986 - Contrariwise, Surrealism in Britain 1930-1936, Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea * 1986 - Surrealism in Britain in the Thirties: Angels of Anarchy and Machines for Making Clouds, Leeds City Art Gallery, Leeds * 1987 - Surrealismi, Retretti Art Centre, Suomi, Finland * 1988 - I Surrealisti, Palazzo Reale, Milan, Italy * 1989 - Die Surrealisten, Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany * 1989 - British Surrealism, Blond Fine Art, London * 1990 - Emmy Bridgwater, Blond Fine Art, London * 1991 - The Birmingham Surrealist Group, John Bonham Murray Feely Fine Art, London * 1992 - Ten Decades - Ten Women Artists born 1897-1906, Norwich Gallery * 1992 - The Foundations of Behaviour, John Bonham Murray Feely Fine Art, London * 1995 - Real Surreal: British and European Surrealism, Wolverhampton Art Gallery * 1996 - Emmy Bridgwater/Conroy Maddox: The Last Surrealists, Blond Fine Art, London * 1996 - The Inner Eye, National Touring Exhibition  Commemoration  A blue plaque commemorating Bridgwater was unveiled at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery by Birmingham Civic Society and then attached to her birthplace and former home in Lee Crescent, Edgbaston in August 2019.

It is designed primarily for use on POSIX-compatible Unix-like operating systems, with limited support for Microsoft Windows. Audacious is the default audio player in Lubuntu and Ubuntu Studio.  History  Audacious began as a fork of Beep Media Player, which itself is a fork of XMMS. William \\"nenolod\\" Pitcock decided to fork Beep Media Player after the original development team announced that they were stopping development in order to create a next-generation version called BMPx. According to the Audacious home page, Pitcock and others \\"had [their] own ideas about how a player should be designed, which [they] wanted to try in a production environment.\\" Since version 2.1, Audacious includes both the Winamp-like interface known from previous versions and a new, GTK-based interface known as GTKUI, which resembles foobar2000 to some extent. GTKUI became the default interface in Audacious 2.4. = Change to C++ and Qt = Before version 3.0, Audacious used the GTK 2.x toolkit by default. Partial support for GTK3 was added in version 2.5, and Audacious 3.0 has full support for GTK3 and uses it by default. However, dissatisfied with the evolution of GTK3, the Audacious team chose to revert to GTK2 starting with the 3.6 release, with long-term plans of porting to Qt. Since August 08, 2018, the official website has HTTPS enabled site-wide and GTK3 support was dropped completely. As version 4.0, Audacious is using Qt as its primary toolkit but the GTK 2.x support is still available.  Features  Audacious with GTK-based interface running on Windows 8. Audacious with Winamp-like interface running on Ubuntu 8.04. Audacious with external .wsz Skin running on Ubuntu 11.10. Audacious contains built-in gapless playback. = Default codec support = * MP3 using libmpg123 * Advanced Audio Coding (AAC and AAC+) * Vorbis * FLAC * Wavpack * Shorten (SHN) * Musepack * TTA (codec) * Windows Media Audio (WMA) * Apple Lossless (ALAC) * 150 different module formats * Several chiptune formats: AY, GBS, GYM, HES, KSS, NSF, NSFE, SAP, SPC, VGM, VGZ, VTX * PlayStation Audio: Portable Sound Format (PSF and PSF2) * Nintendo DS Sound Format: 2SF * Ad-lib chiptunes via AdPlug library * WAV formats provided by libsndfile plug-in. * MIDI via native OS synthesizer control or FluidSynth. * CD Audio = Plug-ins = Audacious owes a large portion of its functionality to plug-ins, including all codecs. More features are available via third-party plug-ins. Current versions of the Audacious core classify plug-ins as follows (some are low level and not user-visible at this time): * Decoder plug-ins, which contain the actual codecs used for decoding content. * Transport plug-ins, which are lowlevel and implemented by the VFS layer. * General plug-ins, which provide user-added services to the player (such as sending tracks with AudioScrobbler) * Output plug-ins, which provide the audio system backend of the player. * Visualization plug-ins, which provide visualizations based on fast Fourier transforms of the wave data. * Effect plug-ins, which provide various sound processing on the decoded audio stream * Container plug-ins, which provide support for playlists and other similar structures. * Lowlevel plug-ins, which provide miscellaneous services to the player core and are not categorized into any of the other plug-ins. * Output plug-ins: ** PulseAudio output ** OSS4 output ** ALSA output ** Sndio output ** SDL output ** FileWriter plug-in – no sound is played, the output is instead redirected into a new file: this plug-in supports the output file formats: WAV, mp3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC, it can be used to transcode a file and also to rip a CD ** JACK output = Skins = Audacious has full support for Winamp 2 skins, and as of version 1.2, some free-form skinning is possible. Winamp .wsz skin files, a type of Zip archive, can be used directly, or can be unarchived to individual directories. The program can use Windows Bitmap (.bmp) graphics from the Winamp archive, although native skins for Linux are usually rendered in Portable Network Graphics (.png) format. Audacious 1.x allows the user to adjust the RGB color balance of any skin, effectively making a basic white skin equivalent to a host of colorized skins without editing them manually. = Clients = Audacious is intended to be a standalone media player not a server (unlike XMMS2), though it accepts connections from client software, such as Conky. Connection to Audacious for remote control can be done over plain DBus, by using an MPRIS-compatible client, or using the official Audtool utility created just for this purpose.

The airport has one runway and is and the terminal building, in size. Northern Air is based at the airport and provides scheduled service to Edmonton, in addition to charters and air ambulance. The airport was the hub of Peace Air until the airline ceased operations in May 2007.  History  That first airport in the area was located on the west bank of the Peace River, about south of the present town site. The site was abandoned when one of Grant McConachie's pilots had a near fatal accident on landing a United Air Transport Limited airline, which was headquartered at the Edmonton Municipal Airport. Historical records indicate that the present site (NW Section 29, Township 83, Range 22, West of the 5th Meridian) was picked by the famous Wop May. Originally the airport had three runways: 04/22, 08/26 and 18/36. Of the three runways shown by the original configuration, one is still operating: 04/22. In the fall of 1942 an American Corps of engineers extended the 04/22 runway by a further . A weather station was also added by the American Government, likely as part of the Alaska Highway effort. On May 28, 29 of 1949 the Peace River Airport played host to one of the first airshows in the region. The Air Cadets of the region played host to the R.C.A.F. who brought with them a helicopter, two Harvard trainers, an Avro Anson, a Beech Expeditor out of which two parachutists jumped. In June 1960 the Peace River Airport closed down in order to complete extensive construction to the airport. The runway was paved and an air terminal was built. Peace River Airport re-opened its runway for major airline service in January 1961. The official opening was held August 9, 1961. This date marked the signing of a long term lease (40 years) between the Department of Transport and the Town of Peace River whereby the Town, with subsidization from Transport Canada, would operate the Airport. During 1964 the first Flight Service Specialists were hired to staff the radio at the Peace River Airport. Prior to this, the pilots spoke to the radio operated by the weather Office at the airport. Even before the Weather Office, the agents of Pacific Western Airlines and Canadian Pacific Airlines had a radio in their homes which they used to communicate with the pilots. PWA did build a small radio shack for their agent. A new terminal building was opened September 8, 1984. The estimated cost of construction being 4.5 million Heritage Fund dollars.http://www.peaceriver.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC;={DEC654D3-E9FD-48CE-A0FC-782A78AF0317} The Town of Peace River purchased the airport from Transport Canada in 1996 following the National Airports Policy.http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/releases-nat-1996-96_h150e-3210.htm  Contemporary Issues  The Peace River Airport Steering Committee has been set up to assess viability and regionalization potential of the airport. The committee has representatives from The Town of Peace River, Northern Sunrise County, Municipal District of Peace No. 135, County of Northern Lights and the Town of Grimshaw, and is working on a business plan. The long runway 04/22 would be able to accommodate a Boeing 737-600, 737-700 and 737-800 equipped with a short-field design package.Boeing 737 Any further extensions to the runway, to enable handling larger aircraft, would have to contend with either Strong Creek's ravine to the west or Highway 2 on the opposite side of the runway.

In 1999, the air terminal was named in honour of World War I ace Raymond Collishaw who was born in Nanaimo. The Nanaimo-Collishaw Air Terminal is the passenger terminal for the airport. The Nanaimo Airport currently has only one available runway for instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions, runway 16. This is because the approach to the north-facing runway (runway 34) is a dogleg approach that follows the Ladysmith Harbour. Expansion In 2010, the Nanaimo Airport Commission announced the completion of a significant runway expansion. The runway length increased by almost to accommodate larger aircraft, as well as the addition of a third taxiway (labelled Charlie), to allow direct access to the threshold of runway 16. Shortly after the runway expansion, Nanaimo Airport saw an increase in commercial traffic because of the subsequent installation of an advanced instrument landing system (ILS) and associated lighting on the south-facing runway 16. This would very soon attract the likes of WestJet Encore and Air Canada Rouge among the existing services offered by Jazz Aviation. Between April 2019 and March 2020, a terminal major terminal expansion took place, increasing the terminal's screening capacity from 100 passengers per hour to 1,000 passengers per hour. The apron was also expanded to compensate for the 60% size increase of the new terminal building. The air terminal saw 435,000 passengers pass through its gates in 2018. Airlines and destinations Nanaimo Airport provides service to Vancouver and Calgary via Air Canada Express and WestJet Encore. Through the Covid-19 Pandemic, passenger service dropped to 1-2 daily flights. These were primarily serviced by Pacific Coastal Airlines and Central Mountain Air under charter agreements.

The rebels ambushed and routed the British. The battle was an ambush of a British force of 400 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Walpole, containing one troop of regular cavalry (the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards) and militia and yeomanry auxiliaries. They were ambushed in a narrow defile by United Irish rebels. Walpole and 100 men were killed, the rest, throwing away their weapons and uniforms, fled. The regular dragoons made an attempt to fight back but they were in a bad place for cavalry so they withdrew. This defeat allowed three cannon to be captured which were subsequently used against British troops at the battle of Arklow. The rebels were unable to take Arklow however.

It is based at the southeastern corner of the former Weston-super-Mare Airport. History The museum originated in 1958 when its founder, aviation writer and historian Elfan ap Rees, began to build up a private collection of rotorcraft documentation and artefacts. Over the next ten years his collection grew and in 1969 he acquired his first complete helicopter, a Bristol Sycamore Mk.3. In 1974, Ap Rees purchased a Bristol Belvedere and formed a volunteer group to restore it. In December 1976, an ex Royal Navy Westland Whirlwind HAS Mk.7 was acquired and added to the collection. In 1977 and 1978, more aircraft were added, including an ex Royal Air Force Bristol Sycamore HC Mk.14 and several rare prototypes: the Fairey Ultra-Light tip-jet driven helicopter, the Thruxton Gadfly HDW.1 two-seat autogyro and the Campbell Cougar autogyro. In 1978, the museum acquired a small area and some buildings on Weston-super-Mare airfield, including a Second World War armoury building and air-raid shelter. The buildings required extensive repair work, but by the summer of 1978 the collection was opened to the public, with nine aircraft and a range of other artefacts on display. The museum was forced to close at the end of the 1979 season, but throughout the 1980s, remains from rare helicopters were added to the collection, often preventing them from being scrapped, including the only remaining major parts of the Fairey Rotodyne. Other aircraft acquired in the 1980s included two more variants of the Westland Whirlwind, a Westland Scout AH Mk.1 and a Westland Wessex. The museum reopened on a new airfield site in 1988 and volunteers spent the next year restoring old buildings and erecting a new display annexe. On 3 November 1989, the museum was officially opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who arrived in a Wessex HC.4 of the Queen's Flight. Since then the museum has grown substantially, erecting new hangarage to put the collection under cover and purchasing its 4.5-acre site outright, with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund and other grants. Throughout its development, the trustees have been led by Ap Rees, who has also been responsible for sourcing and acquiring many rare aircraft for the collection. By 2012, some 45 helicopters and autogyros in the museum qualified for the highest benchmark status in the National Aviation Heritage Register, including a number of sole prototypes and others that were the only examples in the country. The museum continues to restore and display many types of helicopters from various countries and purposes. Collection Kamov Ka-26 from pre- unification East Germany at the museum in June 2004 The museum's collection of helicopters exceeds 80 complete rotorcraft, with others under restoration or only partly complete. The museum features many foreign helicopters, particularly Soviet-era and Eastern European craft, for example the Kamov Ka-26 Hoodlum and the Mi-24 Hind, and more modern ones such as the EH-101. In 2008, several parts of the XCH-62, prototype of the largest helicopter ever built in the western countries, were sent to the Helicopter Museum to be exhibited there.

On the rocket at the left, the nozzle has been deflected to the left and the thrust line is now inclined to the rocket center line at an angle called the gimbal angle. Since the thrust no longer passes through the center of gravity, a torque is generated about the center of gravity and the nose of the rocket turns to the left. If the nozzle is gimbaled back along the center line, the rocket will move to the left. On the rocket at the right, the nozzle has been deflected to the right and the nose is moved to the right.

The highway was constructed in the early 1930s. Route description View west along MD 547 at Summit Avenue in Kensington MD 547 eastbound at Kenilworth Avenue in Garrett Park MD 547 begins as an intersection with MD 355 (Rockville Pike) opposite the entrance to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda. The state highway heads east as Strathmore Avenue, a two-lane undivided road that passes the grounds of Strathmore, which features a namesake mansion and music center, to the south. After passing the Academy of the Holy Cross, MD 547 enters the town of Garrett Park. The highway passes through the Garrett Park Historic District several blocks to the south of the Garrett Park station on MARC's Brunswick Line. After serving as the town's main street, MD 547 veers southeast and its name changes to Knowles Avenue. The route enters Rock Creek Park, where the highway traverses Rock Creek and intersects Beach Drive. At its junction with Summit Avenue, MD 547 enters the town of Kensington, where it reaches its eastern terminus at MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue). Knowles Avenue continues east for a block before ending at Armory Avenue in the Kensington Historic District. History Garrett Park Road was resurfaced with macadam and widened with concrete shoulders from U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) east to the Kensington town limit at Summit Avenue between 1931 and 1933. MD 547's bridge across Rock Creek was completed in 1932. In 1936, the state highway was extended east two blocks to the new alignment of MD 193 (now MD 185). That highway's present course through Kensington was completed as part of a railroad grade separation project that same year. MD 547 has had only minor changes since the 1930s.

The company has evolved from one racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, to a multi US- state, publicly traded company with racetracks, casinos and the United States' leading online wagering company among its portfolio of businesses. History Churchill Downs Incorporated began with the opening of one legendary racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1875. While traveling in England and France in 1872–1873, 26-year-old Meriwether Lewis Clark devised the idea of a Louisville Jockey Club for conducting race meets. Clark toured and visited with a number of notable racing leaders, including England's Admiral Rous and France's Vicomte Darn, vice president of the French Jockey Club. Upon his return from Europe, Clark began development of his racetrack, which would serve to showcase the Kentucky breeding industry. The track would eventually become known as Churchill Downs. The track formally opened on May 17, 1875, with four races scheduled including the day's featured race, the Kentucky Derby. Throughout the early 1900s, Churchill Downs joined with other tracks to create the Kentucky Jockey Club. With five tracks, the Club decided to dissolve in December 1927, with the purpose of re-organizing. In January 1928, the American Turf Association served as the new holding company for Churchill Downs and six other tracks. From 1929 through 1942, the holding company started to reduce the number of tracks. By 1937, there were only three tracks left. In January 1937, Churchill Downs joined with Latonia in Northern Kentucky to create Churchill Downs-Latonia Incorporated. In 1942, Churchill Downs separated from Latonia and officially changed its name to Churchill Downs Incorporated. After simulcasting became commonplace in the early 1990s, the racetrack decided to expand its holdings and move into the simulcasting industry. In 1991, Churchill Downs bought the struggling Louisville Downs harness track, which was closed and converted to a satellite wagering and training facility. In 1994, Churchill Downs began to expand its holdings, with plans to partner with a new racetrack in Indiana. The plan resulted in the purchase of Hoosier Park from businessman Louis Carlo. In 1998, CDI purchased Ellis Park Racecourse in Henderson, Kentucky. In 1999, the company acquired Calder Race Course and Hollywood Park Racetrack from Pinnacle Entertainment In 2000, CDI merged with Arlington Park and the eight OTB's owned by Arlington. In 2004, Churchill Downs Incorporated finalized the purchase of Fair Grounds Race Course. In April 2002, Churchill Downs Incorporated established the Green Pastures Program in partnership with the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation, a leading American racehorse rescue and adoption organization. In 2005, Hollywood Park was sold to Bay Meadows Land Company for $257.5 million, and Ellis Park was sold to businessman Ron Geary in September 2006. In December 2006, Churchill Downs Inc. sold its remaining interest in Hoosier Park to Centaur Inc. In the fall of 2007, Fair Grounds reopened to include a gaming facility adjacent to the track grandstand. In January 2010, Churchill Downs added the casino venue to Calder Race Course. On May 2, 2007, CDI launched its advance deposit wagering service, TwinSpires (www.twinspires.com). TwinSpires.com is the official advance-deposit wagering service for Churchill Downs Incorporated and its family of racetracks, as well for the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks. TwinSpires.com offers wagering on races from the country's most popular racetracks. TwinSpires.com includes the assets of Youbet.com, which Churchill Downs Incorporated acquired in June 2010. The company acquired Harlow's Casino Resort in Greenville, Mississippi, in December 2010 for $138 million. In October 2012, the company acquired the Riverwalk Casino and Hotel in Vicksburg, Mississippi for $141 million. In December 2012, Churchill Downs partnered with Delaware North to buy Lebanon Raceway in Lebanon, Ohio for $60 million. Ohio had recently authorized slot machines at racetracks, which the companies took advantage of by transferring the racing license to a new $215-million facility built between Cincinnati and Dayton. The new racino, Miami Valley Gaming, opened in December 2013. In July 2013, Churchill Downs bought the Oxford Casino in Oxford, Maine for $160 million. In May 2014, CDI and Saratoga Casino Holdings announced a partnership to bid for the Capital Region's casino license, proposing a $300-million destination resort casino in East Greenbush, New York. In October 2014, Churchill agreed to purchase a 25 percent interest in Saratoga, and signed on to manage Saratoga Casino and Raceway, Saratoga Casino Black Hawk, and the proposed Capital View Casino & Resort. The casino proposal was rejected, however, in favor of Rivers Casino. In December 2014, the company acquired Big Fish Games, a developer of casual games, in a deal valued at up to $885 million. It then sold Big Fish Games in 2018 to Aristocrat Leisure for $990 million. The company partnered with Saratoga to purchase Ocean Downs, a harness racing track and casino in Maryland, in January 2017. Churchill Downs took full ownership of Ocean Downs in September 2018, swapping its 25 percent stake in Saratoga for Saratoga's 50 percent stake in the track. In April 2017, the company purchased advance-deposit wagering website BetAmerica.Churchill Downs Inc. Purchases ADW BetAmerica - Jeremy Balan, Bloodhorse, 19 April 2017 In February 2018, Churchill Downs agreed to purchase two casinos (Presque Isle Downs in Pennsylvania and Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg in Mississippi) from Eldorado Resorts for a total of $230 million. The purchase of the Lady Luck was later canceled because of antitrust concerns, and Churchill Downs instead agreed to buy the operations of Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin in Pennsylvania for $100,000. The purchases were completed in early 2019. In September 2018, the company opened Derby City Gaming, a $65-million historical racing parlor, at the site of Louisville Downs. In March 2019, Churchill Downs bought a 62 percent share in Rivers Casino Des Plaines, a few miles away from Arlington Park, from Neil Bluhm and his partners for $401 million. Later that year, Churchill purchased Turfway Park in Northern Kentucky for $46 million, and announced the construction of a $100-million historical racing parlor at the property.

The British won the battle, beating off a rebel attack on Antrim town following the arrival of reinforcements but the county governor, John O'Neill, 1st Viscount O'Neill, was fatally wounded. Background The outbreak of the United Irish rebellion in Leinster on 23 May had prompted calls from Ulster United Irishmen to take to the field in support of their southern comrades. However, the organisation in Ulster had been severely damaged in a brutal disarmament campaign the previous year, and the new leadership were less radical and were not willing take to the field without French assistance, which was expected daily. After waiting for two weeks while the rebellion raged in the south, the grassroots United Irish membership in Antrim decided to hold a number of meetings independent of their leaders. The outcome was the election of Henry Joy McCracken as their adjutant general and the decision to rise immediately. McCracken, together with James Hope, quickly formulated a plan to attack and seize all government outposts in County Antrim and then for the main attack to fall on Antrim town. Then using artillery seized at Antrim, the rebels were to march on Belfast in conjunction with the United Irish rebels in County Down. McCracken had high hopes that many members of the militia would desert and join him, as disaffection was believed to be widespread, evidenced by the execution of four of the Monaghan militia for treason in Belfast in May. Rebellion in Antrim On 6 June, McCracken issued a proclamation calling for the United army of Ulster to rise. The initial plan met with success, as the towns of Larne, Ballymena, Portaferry and Randalstown (captured by James Dickey) were taken and the bridge at Toome damaged to prevent the government rushing reinforcements into Antrim from west of the Bann. The rebels then assembled at Donegore Hill in preparation for the march and attack on Antrim town, where an emergency meeting of the county's magistrates called by the county governor, Lord O'Neill, was due to take place. Although almost 10,000 rebels assembled at Donegore, many displayed reluctance for the coming fight and stayed on the hill in reserve or deserted later so that probably fewer than 4,000 actually took part in the attack. The United Irishmen in Ulster were mostly Presbyterian, but were joined with Catholic Defenders and the tension between the two groups on the march may have caused some desertions. These difficulties led to a loss of momentum, and the attack was delayed. McCracken was forced to make adjustments to his plan of attack, which had envisaged a simultaneous overwhelming assault on the town from four separate points. Garrison at Antrim The town was garrisoned by a small force of about 200 yeomen, cavalry under Lt-Col William Lumley and armed volunteers but they also had four artillery pieces and the delay in the rebel attack had allowed them to send requests for assistance to Belfast and Lisburn from where reinforcements were already on the way. The garrison formed themselves at the base of the demense wall of Antrim Castle, with artillery to the front and cavalry to the rear with their flanks anchored by the Market House and Presbyterian Meeting House. A part of the Scottish Quarter in the town was also burned by the garrison as it was perceived to be a stronghold of rebel sympathisers. Attack begins The attack finally began shortly before 3pm when the rebels began a cautious march through the town. As rebel front ranks arrived to face the garrison's defensive line, artillery opened fire on the rebels, causing them to pull back out of range. Large clouds of dust and smoke were thrown up which, together with the fires from the Scottish Quarter, obscured the garrison's view of events. The rebel withdrawal was mistaken for a full retreat and the cavalry moved out to pursue and rout the supposed fleeing rebels. The cavalry effectively ran into a gauntlet of rebels who were protected by a long churchyard wall and stationed in houses along the main street, suffering heavy losses to the gunfire and pikes of the rebels. After routing the cavalry, the rebels attacked the remainder of the garrison, which then began to pull back to the safety of the castle wall; this was mistaken by a newly arrived rebel column as an attack on them, causing them to flee in panic. In the confusion, the county commander, Lord O'Neill, trapped with his magistrates, was fatally wounded. A rebel attempt to seize the artillery was only narrowly beaten off by troops stationed behind the demense wall. At this critical juncture, British reinforcements from Belfast arrived outside the town and, assuming it to be held by the rebels, began to shell it with their artillery. This prompted more desertions and the rebel army began to disintegrate, but their withdrawal was protected by a small band under James Hope which fought a successful rearguard action from the church grounds along the main street, which allowed the bulk of the rebels to withdraw safely. Aftermath When the military entered the town, they began a spree of looting, burning and murder, of which the most enthusiastic perpetrators were reported to be the Monaghan militiamen, who were anxious to prove their loyalty and expunge the shame of the recent executions of their comrades for sedition. McCracken, Hope and their remaining supporters withdrew northwards, establishing camps of ever dwindling size along the route of their retreat until news of the defeat at Ballynahinch caused their final dispersion. McCracken was arrested by yeomen on 7 July and was hanged in Belfast on 17 July, having refused an offer of clemency in return for informing on his comrades. Commemoration of the centenary of the battle, marked by a nationalist parade in Belfast on 6 June 1898, provoked loyalist riots.Guy Beiner, Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 384-386 References Antrim Antrim Category:Antrim, County Antrim Category:18th century in County Antrim ","title":"Battle of Antrim"},{"id":"3648431","text":"Acmonia or Akmonia () is an ancient city and a titular see of Phrygia Pacatiana, in Asia Minor, now known as Ahat Köyü. It is mentioned by Cicero (Pro Flacco, 15) and was a point on the road between Dorylaeum and Philadelphia. Under the Romans, it was within the conventus iuridicus of Apamea.  Bishopric  Acmonia appears in the Notitiae Episcopatuum from the 10th to the 12th or 13th century. The first bishop whose name is known is Optimus, who was transferred to the metropolitan see of Antiochia in Pisidia before 381. Gennadius took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Theotimus signed in 459 the decree of Patriarch Gennadius I of Constantinople against the simoniacs. Paulus was at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. Eustathius was a both the Council of Constantinople (869) and the Council of Constantinople (879). Somewhat less certain is the attribution to this diocese of Basilius, who participated in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680. He is recorded as bishop of Κολωνία Πακατιανή (Colonia of the province of Pacatiana) but, as there is no record of such a diocese, it is thought that Κολωνία is a mistake for Ἀκμωνία (Acmonia).Sophrone Pétridès, v.

Like many other cognomina, this name is connected with agriculture, and comes from the verb pisere or pinsere, which refers to the pounding or grinding of corn. The family first rose from obscurity during the Second Punic War, and from that time it became one of the most distinguished in the Roman state. It preserved its celebrity under the empire, and during the first century was second to the imperial family alone. Many of the Pisones bore this cognomen alone, but others bore the agnomina Caesoninus and Frugi. Of the other surnames of the Republican Calpurnii, Bestia refers to a \\"beast\\", \\"an animal without reason\\". Bibulus translates as \\"fond of drinking\\", or \\"thirsty\\", while Flamma refers to a flame.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. Bestia, Bibulus, Flamma.

A long and flat peninsula surrounded by the Gulf of Mexico, the Florida Straits and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida has a long and rich maritime history. The size and shape of Florida, along with its natural features like reefs, shoals, water depth, currents, locations of rivers and inlets and the weather, have affected where people lived and where vessels wrecked. Florida has some of the best natural harbors in the country, resulting in the state becoming an international maritime crossroads. Humans have inhabited Florida for at least twelve thousand years, and perhaps more. The earliest inhabitants would not recognize their home today, because the sea level is twenty to fifty fathoms higher and has covered nearly half of the Florida peninsula. Many people lived near springs and sinkholes and along rivers and near the coasts in areas like present-day Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, relying on fresh and saltwater fish and shellfish as important parts of their diet. The archeological remains at some of the earliest places they lived now are underwater and on the bottom of rivers and springs and offshore on the continental shelf. From at least six thousand years ago, the native people of Florida traveled the waterways and coasts by canoe, facilitating communication and trade among the tribes. About three hundred prehistoric canoes have been found in more than two hundred sites in Florida. European exploration In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, looking for a faster way to Asia by sea, European explorers sailed west and ran into the Americas. Seeing new resources to exploit, people to convert and lands to claim, the Spanish, the French and the English sent militaries, missionaries and colonists to establish a foothold and expand their areas of control. The first evidence of a European encounter in Florida is the arrival of Spaniard Juan Ponce de León in the vicinity of present-day St. Augustine in 1513. Ponce de León named the land \\"La Florida\\" and attempted to circumnavigate what he thought was an island, sailing south to the Keys, naming a cluster of islands \\"Las Tortugas\\" and sailing north to present-day Tampa. Ponce de León was followed by fellow Spaniard Pánfilo de Narváez who landed near Tampa Bay in 1528 and proceeded north to the area now known as Apalachee. Only four members of the Narváez expedition survived, including Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who wrote an account of their travels. A fifth member of the expedition, Juan Ortiz lived as a slave in the Tampa Bay area for nearly twelve years before being rescued in 1539 by Hernando de Soto. He landed in Tampa Bay with nine ships and over 600 soldiers. He spent five months around what is today Tallahassee, and his explorations of southern North America are commemorated at De Soto National Memorial. In 1559, Spaniard Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano established a short-lived colony at Pensacola Bay but lost all except three of his supply ships to a hurricane. He sailed away after two years, a broken and beaten man. The Emanuel Point shipwreck site discovered in 1992 by the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research is believed to be one of his lost ships. In 1562, the French sent Jean Ribaut to the New World intending to found a Huguenot colony. His expedition first arrived in Florida, and marked a spot on the St. Johns River for future settlement and then headed north to establish Charlesfort in present-day Parris Island, South Carolina. The colony failed, and in 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière led the settlers back to Florida and established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville. In 1565, Spaniard Pedro Menéndez de Avilés captured Fort Caroline in a brutal fight with the French and established St. Augustine, the first permanent European colony in the continental United States. In 1568, Frenchman Dominique de Gourgues recaptured Fort Caroline. In 1569, the Spanish built a watchtower at Matanzas Inlet to watch the horizon and warn St. Augustine of approaching ships, a strategy that failed them in 1586, when English privateer Sir Francis Drake attacked and looted St. Augustine. The French effort to establish a colony in Florida is memorialized today at Fort Caroline National Memorial. St. Augustine, which had aids-to-navigation (wooden watchtowers which may have been lit at night) established as early as the 1580s, and saw ships come and go on an annual basis through the present day, is considered the nation's oldest port. From the late 16th through the 18th centuries, the Spanish sent annual convoys of merchant and military escort vessels from Cuba to Spain. Referred to as the Spanish plate fleets, the ships carried gold, silver and gemstones from the mines of Mexico and Peru, and porcelains, silks, pearls, spices and other highly sought goods from Asia that reached the Americas via the Spanish Manila Galleon fleet that crossed the Pacific. The homeward bound Spanish plate fleets followed the Gulf Stream through the Straits of Florida and up the coast of North America before heading east for the Azores and Spain. The Spanish built Castillo de San Marcos and other coastal forts and settlements in Florida to provide protection from French and British raiders and pirates, and assist in saving survivors and salvaging cargoes from vessels that wrecked along Florida's shores as a result of hurricanes and mishaps. 17th and 18th centuries The Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine—construction started in 1672 and was completed 23 years later Over the years, many Spanish ships were lost off the Florida coast with the greatest disasters suffered by the fleets of 1622, 1715 and 1733. In 1622, eight ships were lost in a hurricane as they entered the Florida straits. During the 20th century, the remains of a number of lost ships have been found, including from the 1622 fleet, from the 1715 fleet and San Pedro from the 1733 fleet. Eleven Spanish galleons were lost in the hurricane of 1715, wrecking on the shallow reefs between Sebastian Inlet and Fort Pierce. More than seven hundred men perished in the storm, including the Spanish Commander. The McLarty Treasure Museum at the southern end of Sebastian Inlet State Recreation Area takes an in-depth look at the history surrounding this disaster. The 11 lost ships were part of the Spanish Plate Fleet. The Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society Museum in Key West has displays of treasure and other artifacts from Nuestra Señora de Atocha and Santa Margarita, which was lost in 1622. Fort Matanzas—view of fort's western and southern facades. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Spanish, French and English continued to fight over territory and religion in Florida. The British in Georgia and South Carolina attempted to push southward and the French moved eastward along the Gulf Coast from the Mississippi River valley. The Spanish relied not only on Castillo de San Marcos to protect St. Augustine, but began construction of Fort Matanzas in 1740 for additional protection from the south. During the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739 through 1748) between Spain and Great Britain, the Royal Navy patrolled the Caribbean and the North American coastline. One ship that was lost during this time was , the wreck of which is located within the boundaries of Biscayne National Park and which has been extensively studied by the National Park Service and Florida State University. In 1763, under the Treaty of Paris, Spain gave Britain control of Florida in exchange for Havana, Cuba, which the British had captured during the Seven Years' War (1756 through 1763). That same year, the British built a fort overlooking the entrance to Pensacola Bay. Almost the entire population of St. Augustine moved to Cuba at the end of the war. Biscayne National Park, home to Spain captured Pensacola in 1781 and regained control of the rest of Florida in 1783, when Britain gave Florida to Spain in exchange for the Bahamas and Gibraltar. Around 1797, Spain built two forts at Pensacola Bay in the vicinity of the earlier British fort. Little physical evidence of these forts remains but what does remain is preserved at Gulf Islands National Seashore. Gulf Islands National Seashore, near Pensacola Although Britain's control of Florida was brief, its effect on the economy and settlement was substantial. As the British population increased and slaves were brought in, colonial plantations and other industries sprouted and flourished, exporting their products to other British colonies and trading illegally with Spanish Louisiana and Mexico. This was made possible because surveyors mapped the landscape, land grants were given out, the first road was built and a packet system of shipping by rivers and along the coasts was introduced. This economic prosperity and maritime trade continued after Britain ceded Florida to Spain, with exports to neighboring Gulf Coast and Eastern seaboard areas, the Northeast and as far away as Europe. It was during Florida's second Spanish period that folklore claims that shipping in the Gulf of Mexico was ravaged by the pirate José Gaspar (also known as Gasparilla) from his \\"regal\\" base in Charlotte Harbor. Though Gaspar is a well-known figure along Florida's Gulf coast and is celebrated at Tampa's annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival, there is no archival or physical evidence that he ever existed. 18th and 19th centuries Alligator Reef Lighthouse, east of Indian Key. Completed on November 25, 1873, it became automated in 1963 Spain ceded Florida to the United States as part of the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, and Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821. Coastal trade with other markets continued to expand and towns like Jacksonville, Pensacola and Tampa became important ports. After becoming a U.S. territory, the federal government began building a series of lighthouses as aids to navigation along the coasts of Florida to mark dangerous headlands, shoals, bars and reefs. Florida's first coastal navigational aid was a 1586 Spanish watchtower at St. Augustine, but the first true lighthouse was a seventy three-foot harbor light built there in 1824. Masonry towers proved vulnerable to storms and erosion—the lighthouse built in Key West in 1825 and the lighthouse built in 1827 on Sand Key, near Key West, both collapsed in an 1846 hurricane, killing a total of twenty people who had sought refuge in the two towers. Other Florida lighthouses had to be abandoned or moved when the sand around their foundations washed away. Information about historic lighthouses in Florida has been recorded by the National Park Service in its Inventory of Historic Light Stations and by the United States Coast Guard (see List of the 1733 Spanish Plate Fleet Shipwrecks). As large parts of the Florida coast remained unprotected by lighthouses until late in the 19th century, ships frequently wrecked along coast, particularly along the Florida Keys, where for a while wrecking made Key West the largest and richest city in Florida. The U.S. Navy has played a prominent role in Florida's maritime history. In the 1820s, the U.S. Navy was called upon to protect ships off Florida's coasts from pirates that plagued merchant ships in the Caribbean. One of the patrol ships was , lost near Islamorada while escorting a merchant convoy. Artist illustration of USS Alligator, which ran aground on a reef near Islamorada on November 18, 1822 In 1826, construction began on the Pensacola Navy Yard and four forts to defend it. What remains of Fort Pickens, Fort Barrancas and Fort McRee, which were built overlooking Pensacola Bay in the vicinity of the earlier British and Spanish forts, is preserved today within Gulf Islands National Seashore. Near the end of the 19th century, and as a result of the Spanish–American War, Tampa and other Florida ports became staging areas for tens of thousands of U.S. troops and supplies headed to Cuba. With the advent of manned controlled flight and the building of aircraft carriers and seaplanes, an aviation training station was established by the U.S. Navy at Pensacola in 1913 and another in Jacksonville in 1940. Following statehood in 1845, Florida's economy became stronger and the principal ports shipped vast quantities of citrus, cotton, lumber and other products to the Atlantic states, the Caribbean and Europe. The Federal government began construction of coastal forts including Fort Taylor in Key West and Fort Jefferson on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas to better control navigation through the Florida Straits. Although Fort Jefferson was never finished, construction continued for 30 years, and vast quantities of bricks were shipped to the key in flat-bottomed steamboats like that found at the Bird Key wreck, which was lost while transporting bricks. Fort Jefferson on Garden Key, set aside as a national monument by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, and redesignated as Dry Tortugas National Park in 1992 Florida seceded from the Union in 1861 and joined the Confederacy. During the Civil War, Florida's ports were blockaded by the Union and blockade runners delivered supplies needed by the Confederacy in exchange for Florida products. Although there were some vessel casualties on both sides, the major naval battles took place in states north of Florida. One unfortunate casualty in Florida waters was the Union transport ship that struck a Confederate mine. After the Civil War, tenant farmers and sharecroppers took over plantation lands, and agriculture, cattle ranching, lumber, manufacturing and extractive industries like phosphate mining became important, prompting improvements in transportation. Railroads expanded across the state connecting the ports and the interior, and steamboats like , and began providing regular passenger and freight service on inland waterways like the St. Johns River and ocean service to international destinations. Tourism flourished with steamboat tours and hotels near rail lines. In 1900, during the daytime, SS Copenhagen was heading south close to the Florida coast—to avoid the northerly Gulf Stream current—when it suddenly crashed into a reef offshore of present-day Pompano Beach at full speed. In 1994, the remains became the fifth Underwater Archaeological Preserve in the state. Underwater artifact with sea life off the coast of Florida During the late 19th century, the federal government and local port authorities made improvements to channels and harbors and charted and mapped Florida's waters. These improvements, along with technological advances in navigation and shipbuilding during the 20th century, helped propel Florida's ports to global prominence in trade and commerce and the cruise industry and marine recreation. Florida may well hold the record for the number of pleasure boats used by sport fishermen, jet skiers, wind-surfers, power boaters, sail boaters, water-skiers and scuba divers. The Florida Keys contain the only coral reefs in the continental United States, making it a haven for fish and coral. These same reefs are hazards to navigation. Thousands of ships have wrecked over the centuries in the Keys and elsewhere in the waters of Florida. The most famous Spanish wreck found west of the Florida Keys was the above-mentioned Nuestra Señora de Atocha, found after a sixteen-year search by Mel Fisher in 1985. The value of the ship's treasure has been estimated at $300,000,000. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the U.S. Coast Guard had to deal with thousands of Cubans trying to make it to the shores of Florida. More than 2,700 were stopped in 2005. Often crossing the strait in home-made rafts and boats, it is unknown how many have lost their lives in the attempt. Under U.S. and Cuban law, emigration is illegal, and any Cuban attempting to reach the U.S. found at sea will be deported. Under a 1995 migration accord between the two nations, Cubans who make it to the shores of Florida or other states are generally allowed to remain.

It is the third film and the last to be directed by Winner in the Death Wish film series. It stars Charles Bronson as vigilante killer Paul Kersey, and sees Kersey do battle with New York street punk gangs while receiving tacit support from a local NYPD lieutenant (Ed Lauter). Despite being set in New York City, some of the filming was shot in London to reduce production costs. It was succeeded by Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. Plot Paul Kersey returns to New York City after being banned for a history of vigilante justice to visit his Korean War buddy Charley, who is attacked by a gang in his East New York apartment. The neighbors hear the commotion and call the police. Paul arrives and Charley collapses dead in his arms. The police mistake Paul for the murderer and arrest him. At the police station, Police Chief Richard Shriker recognizes Paul as \\"Mr. Vigilante\\". Shriker lays down the law before Paul is taken to a holding cell. In the same cell is Manny Fraker, leader of the gang who killed Charley. After a fight between Paul and him, Manny is released. The police receive daily reports about the increased rate of crime. Shriker offers a deal to Paul: he can kill all the punks he wants, as long as he informs Shriker of any gang activity he hears about so the police can get a bust and make news. Paul moves into Charley's apartment in a gang-turf war zone. The building is populated by elderly tenants terrified of Manny's gang. They include Bennett Cross, a World War II veteran and Charley's buddy; Mr. and Mrs. Kaprov, an elderly Jewish couple; and a young Hispanic couple, Rodriguez and his wife Maria. After a few violent muggings, Paul buys a used car as bait. When two gang members try to break into the car, Paul shoots them with his Colt Cobra. Paul twice protects Maria from the gang, but is unable to save her a third time. She is assaulted and raped, later dying in hospital from her injuries. Kersey orders a new gun, a Wildey hunting pistol. He spends the afternoon with Bennett handloading ammunition for it. He then tests the gun when the Giggler steals his Nikon camera. Paul is applauded by the neighborhood as Shriker and the police take the credit. Kersey also throws a gang member off a roof. Public defender Kathryn Davis is moving out of the city and Kersey offers to take her to dinner. While waiting in his car, Kathryn is knocked unconscious by Manny and the car is pushed downhill into oncoming traffic. It slams into another car and explodes, killing Kathryn. Shriker places Kersey under protective custody, fearing he is in too deep. After Bennett's taxi shop is blown up, he tries to get even, but his machine gun jams. The gang cripples Bennett. Kersey is taken by Shriker to the hospital, where he escapes after Bennett tells him where to find a second machine gun. Kersey and Rodriguez collect weapons. They proceed to mow down many of the criminals before running out of ammunition. Other neighbors begin fighting back as Manny sends in reinforcements. Shriker decides to help, and Kersey and he take down many of the gang together. Kersey goes back to the apartment to collect more ammunition, but Manny finds him there. Shriker arrives and shoots Manny, but not before getting wounded in the arm. As Kersey calls for an ambulance, Manny (who was secretly wearing a bulletproof vest) rises and turns his gun on the two men. As Shriker distracts him, Kersey uses a mail-ordered M72 LAW rocket launcher to obliterate Manny. The remainder of the gang rushes to the scene and sees Manny's smoldering remains. Surrounded by the angry crowds of neighbors, the gang realizes they've lost and flee the scene. As the neighbors cheer in celebration and with police sirens in the distance, Shriker gives Kersey a head start. Kersey gives a look of appreciation and takes off.

Financially, their most reliable products were formulaic action films starring Charles Bronson, Chuck Norris, and other stars of the genre.Talbot (2006), p. 58-75 The new sequel to Death Wish was announced at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Charles Bronson haggled with Cannon over his fee so they offered the role to Chuck Norris who turned it down claiming that the violence in the movie was \\"too negative\\". Bronson was paid $1.5 million out of the $10 million budget. The concept of Paul Kersey facing a street gang which terrorizes elderly citizens was developed by screenwriter Don Jakoby. Jakoby specialized in science fiction films, having developed scripts for other upcoming films such as Lifeforce (1985) and Invaders from Mars (1986). His screenplay reportedly turned Kersey into an urban version of John Rambo, displeasing Bronson in the process. The producers then tasked Gail Morgan Hickman to write other potential versions of the script. Hickman came up with three different script samples and submitted them for approval. He learned weeks later that they were all rejected in favor of keeping Jakoby's version. Once again, director Michael Winner was recruited for the film project. His latest films, The Wicked Lady (1983) and Scream for Help (1984), were box office flops and Winner was in need of a \\"surefire hit\\". He decided against retaining the grim tone of the previous two Death Wish films, in favor of going gung-ho for the third film. Bronson said the film was \\"nearly the same as the first two Death Wishes that came before except this time he's not alone... It is a very violent picture but it all falls within the category of the story.\\" Bronson did add however that \\"there are men on motorbikes, an element that's threatening – throwing bottles and that sort of thing – and I machine gun them. That to me is excessive violence and is unnecessary.\\" Filming started on April 19, 1985 in a \\"crime-infested\\" area of Brooklyn. Other New York locations used for the film included the Queensboro Bridge, the bus terminal of Manhattan's Port Authority, and Long Island. In early May, the production team moved to London. Winner found it useful that both cities had a lot of Victorian buildings. The police station scenes were filmed at the old Lambeth Hospital in Lambeth, which has since been demolished. The neighborhood used for the gang war of the film was in Brixton, a district which was infested with real-life gangs. Cinematographer John Stanier was previously director of photography in Oxford Blues (1984) and The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission (1985). He would subsequently film Rambo III (1988). The film includes a scene involving punks attempting to rape a topless woman. The role was played by Sandy Grizzle, the then-lover of the director. She would subsequently report of this relationship in the tabloids Daily Star and News of the World. She claimed that Winner whipped her and used her as a sex slave. The screenplay included a male-on-male prison rape in its early scenes. It was rejected and never filmed, but a similar scene was later included in another Bronson film, Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects (1989). There were several other cut scenes. Don Jakoby objected to extensive rewrites of his script and asked for his name to be removed from the credits. The film used the pseudonym \\"Michael Edmonds\\" to credit its screenwriter. Although Jimmy Page is credited as composer, he had no involvement with the movie. Michael Winner reused Page's score for Death Wish II in the editing stage, and rearranged the music for the actual soundtrack, which included Mike Moran (credited as \\"arranger and conductor\\") on synthesizers. The film incorporated two elements of the Death Wish novel by Brian Garfield. The first was the concept of a giggling Puerto Rican thug; the second was the use of a car as bait for thieves. A scheduled novelization of the film was cancelled, since Garfield retained the exclusive right to write sequel novels. According to the book 'Bronson's Loose' by Paul Talbot, the original working title \\"Death Wish III\\" was changed to \\"Death Wish 3\\" because the Cannon Group conducted a survey and found that nearly half of the U.S. population could not read Roman numerals. In his introduction to the Audible audio-book of \\"The Saint Intervenes\\", Brad Mengel states that the plot of Death Wish 3 is entirely based on \\"The Saint in New York\\", both by Leslie Charteris. =Filming= Even though Death Wish 3 takes place in New York City, some parts of the film were shot in London to make the production less expensive. As a result, some of the extras (both police and gang members) were British. When filming was complete, Michael Winner solicited the help of U.S. Air Force military personnel stationed at High Wycombe Air Station in the UK to provide dubbing with their New York accents for the accents of the British extras. Of the British actors who appeared, Marina Sirtis had previously worked for Michael Winner on The Wicked Lady (1983). She followed her appearance in this film with landing the role of Deanna Troi on the TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987. Weapons used in the film include a Wildey .475 caliber handgun, a .38 caliber snubnose revolver, a German World War II MG-42, a Browning .30 machine gun and an anti-tank rocket launcher. Unusually, the end credits don't mention any work done in Britain (although several crew members have the word \\"USA\\" in brackets next to their titles). Winner edited the film under the pseudonym \\"Arnold Crust\\". Reception The film opened on November 1, 1985 on 1,460 screens and was number one at the U.S. box office for the weekend with a gross of $5,319,116. It was number one the following weekend too. The film earned $16.1 million in a seven-week run. Profits from foreign release, video, and television were sufficient to make this a lucrative release for Cannon films. After its release in theaters, Death Wish 3 received primarily negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 11% approval rating based on 18 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.23/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"Overwhelming Dislike\\". Roger Ebert remarked that the film is a marginal improvement over Death Wish II with better action, directing, and special effects, but is still poor in absolute terms. He further commented that Bronson's acting showed his lack of enthusiasm for the film, and gave it one star. Variety also described Bronson's performance as lifeless, though they said the film's main flaw was its failure to provide a convincing motive for Paul Kersey's latest killing spree. Walter Goodman of The New York Times ridiculed the film's lack of realism, particularly that violent crime is surrealistically rampant, and that the repetition of the basic plot of the original Death Wish (i.e. that Kersey's closest friends and relatives are brutally murdered) grows more absurd with each installment of the series. He summarized that \\"There is not a moment of credibility in the movie and the ending is sheer chaos, and anticlimactic at that. Mr. Winner runs out of imagination before Mr. Bronson runs out of ammunition.\\" However, he acknowledged that the film effectively created all the elements that make the Death Wish series appealing to its fans. Some lambasted the film for sadistic over-violent content and the fact that a 64-year-old Charles Bronson was thrown into a Rambo-like situation. Leonard Maltin said: \\"Same old stuff; Bronson's 'ordinary guy' character is no longer convincing, since his entire immediate family was wiped out by the end of Part 2.\\"Leonard Maltin\\", \\"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide 2011 Edition\\". Plume, 2010 1643 (p. 335) In later years, it gathered a cult following, possibly due to its over-the-top nature, including lengthy action scenes (particularly the shoot 'em up finale), stylized violence, cheesy dialogue, and memorable one-liners. Its unreality has, in some film cult circles, been seen as \\"so bad it's hilariously good\\". Video game The film was made into a video game of the same name by Gremlin Graphics for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, MSX and Amstrad CPC. In the game, the player controls Paul Kersey in the streets and buildings in a free- roaming, all-out gunfight with gangsters. It was one of the goriest games of its time, featuring multiple weapons with detailed, different damage patterns and the possibility to kill civilians.

In a more restricted sense, the term \\"acolouth\\" refers to the fixed portion of the Office (which does not change daily). The portions of the Office that are variable are called the Sequences. While the structure and history of the various forms of the Divine Office in the numerous ancient Christian rites is exceedingly rich, the following article will restrict itself to the practice as it evolved in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. The Office is composed of both musical and rhetorical elements, the first usually given in the musical mode or tone (echos), according to which the liturgical compositions are chanted. There are eight musical modes: four primary and four secondary (plagal). The rhetorical elements are seldom given in a normal speaking voice, but are \\"read\\" in a simple recitative. As the early chanters rarely used texts set to musical notation, they learned by heart the words and music of some standard hymn, and this served as a model for other hymns of the same rhythm or meter. For example, in a Canon, the strophe or stanza of a standard hymn which indicates the melody of a composition is known as an irmos (eirmos, hirmos). An irmos is placed at the beginning of an Ode to introduce the melody to which it should be chanted, and to tie the theme of the Biblical Canticle on which it is based to the hymns of the Ode that follow (see Canon). A katabasia is the irmos that is sung at the end of an Ode by the choir (which descend from their seats (kathismata) and stand on the floor of the church to sing it). The katabasia winds down the Ode and returns it again to the theme of the Biblical Canticle. Cycles The Divine Services are composed of a number of cycles, some large some small, all of which combine to form the services. These cycles are governed by rules prescribed in the Typicon. The basic cycle is the Daily Cycle, which is composed of the Acolouthia (distinct services) into which the Sequences for that day—which are taken from the other cycles—are inserted. The liturgical day begins at sunset, so Vespers is the first service of the day. Acolouthia The individual Offices that make up the daily cycle of services are: Vespers, Midnight Office, Orthros (Matins), the four Little Hours, and Apodeipnon (Compline). To this could be added the Typica, which is said on days on which there is no celebration of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist). Most of the Offices start with the Usual Beginning (a blessing by the priest, followed by the Trisagion and other prayers, ending with the Lord's Prayer and the call to worship: \\"O come, let us worship God our King...\\"), followed by one or several Psalms. The Psalter figures prominently in the Divine Services, and are found both in the fixed and the moveable portions of the services. In the descriptions that follow, the Septuagint numbering of the Psalms will be used. =Vespers= Vespers is the first office of the day, chanted around the time of sunset, and has three variations: Little Vespers, Great Vespers, and daily Vespers. This is the service that introduces the feast being celebrated that day. Since the day begins at sunset, Vespers for Sunday is celebrate on Saturday evening, etc. At an All-Night Vigil Great Vespers is combined with Matins and First Hour to form one continuous service. In the Greek practice, a Vigil is only performed for one of the Great Feasts of the church year; the Slavs will also perform the Vigil on every Saturday evening. Little Vespers Little Vespers is chanted only before an All-Night Vigil. It is a very abbreviated forma and consist of the Usual Beginning, after which the Reader says Psalm 103 while the priest silently reads the Prayers of Lamplighting (Lychnic). This is followed by the Great Ektenia (Litany). Then the choir chants \\"Lord, I have cried\\" (Psalms 140, 141, 129, and 116) with four stichera interposed between the last few verses. Then the Phos Hilaron (a short hymn, praising God at the time of sunset), the prokeimenon, the aposticha, the Nunc dimittis, the trisagion, and the apolytikion. Great Vespers Great Vespers is celebrated on Sundays and feast days, either separately or as part of the All-Night Vigil. It starts with a blessing by the priest and the \\"Usual Beginning\\" (unless it is a Vigil, in which case the blessing is different and the Usual Beginning is abbreviated). It is an All- Night Vigil, the priest and deacon perform a full censing of the church. The chanters sing Psalm 103 (either in its entirety or a selection of verses), while the priest comes to stand on the ambon in front of the Holy Doors to recite the \\"Prayers of Lamp-lighting\\", after which he goes back inside the sanctuary. Then the deacon comes out onto the ambon and leads the Great Ektenia. Choir chants the first kathisma (a division of the psalter), broken up into three sections, called stases. After each section the deacon leads a Little Ektenia (on Feast Days which do not fall on Sunday only the first stasis and its ektenia is performed). Then the chanters begin \\"Lord, I Have Cried\\" with eight stichera (ten on Sundays), while the deacon performs a censing of the entire church. After putting on his phelonion, the priest says the Prayer of the Entrance, and he and the deacon go out the side door of the Iconostasis to make the Little Entrance with the censer. After the prokeimenon (and, on feast days, readings from the Old Testament) the deacon recites the ektenias, and the priest says a prayer while all reverently bow their heads. Then all go in procession to the narthex of the church while the choir chants stichera proper to the feast. There the deacon recites the Litiy (an ektenia, invoking the names of many saints, to which the choir answers Kyrie Eleison many times). Then, if it is a Vigil, the priest blesses loaves of bread, wheat, wine and oil. These will be used for the refreshment and blessing of those attending the vigil. Next the aposticha (stichera proper to the feast) are chanted by the choir followed by the Nunc Dimittis, the trisagion prayers, the Lord's Prayer, the apolytikion (hymn of the Feast), and the dismissal by the Priest. Daily Vespers Vespers, as it is celebrated on ordinary weekdays (i.e., Sunday night through Friday night when there is no occurrence of a Great Feast or major feast day) is very much the same as Great Vespers, but minus some of the more festal aspects. The deacon does not normally serve at daily Vespers, but all of his parts will be done by the priest. After the opening blessing and Psalm 103, the priest recites Great Ektenia. The reader then recites a kathisma (except on Sunday night or any night following an All- Night Vigil). After the Little Ektenia the chanters begin \\"Lord, I Have Cried\\" with six or eight stichera, while the priest performs the censing. There is no Little Entrance and there are no readings from Scripture. Rather, after the conclusion of the Theotokion at the end of \\"Lord I Have Cried\\", the priest leads the prokeimenon, and the priest says the first of the two litanies, the reader recites the prayer \\"Vouchsafe, O Lord...\\" and the priest says the second litany and the prayer at the \\"Bowing of Heads\\". Next the Aposticha are chanted by the choir followed by the Nunc Dimittis, the trisagion (a prayer to the Trinity), the Lord's Prayer, the apolytikion (hymn of the day), concluding with the dismissal by the priest. =Compline= Compline (Greek: Apodeipnon, Slavonic: Povochernia) is the last Office of the waking day, and is served in two different manners: Little Compline and Great Compline. Great Compline is said during the Lenten seasons and on the eves of certain Great Feasts. Great Compline is much longer than Little Compline and has a much more penitential theme to it, including numerous prostrations. Little Compline is read any time Great Compline is not called for. It is composed of psalms, a doxology, troparion, the trisagion, the Lord's Prayer, the Kyrie Eleison repeated twelve times, and invitatory versicles, and Psalms 50, 69, and 162, which are followed by the greater doxology, the Creed, the trisagion, the Lord's Prayer, the troparion proper to the feast, the Kyrie Eleison repeated forty times, several invocations, and the long prayers of dismissal. =Midnight Office= The Midnight Office is normally celebrated only in monasteries, except for the Paschal Vigil when it has a unique structure followed only on that day. Throughout the year, there are three different forms of the Midnight Office: Saturday, Sunday, and Weekday. =Matins= The first part of Orthros, consists of twelve prayers read by the priest in front of the Holy Doors while the reader reads the Six Psalms, the greater litany, two stichera followed by Psalms 134 and 135, a third sticheron followed by the gradual psalms, an antiphon with the prokeimenon, the reading of the Gospel, many acclamations and the Canon, while the second part of the Orthros, corresponding to Lauds in the Roman Office, is composed of Psalms 148, 149, 150, several similar stichera, the greater doxology, a benediction, and the dismissal. Each of the Little Hours may followed by a supplementary hour, called an Inter-Hour (Mesorion) during certain seasons of the year. The First Hour (Prime) begins with the recitation of three psalms followed by a doxology, two stichoi, a doxology, a troparion in honour of the Theotokos, the trisagion, several variable troparia, the doxology and dismissal, while its supplementary Hour is composed of a troparion, doxology, Theotokion, Kyrie Eleison repeated forty times, a prayer, and a doxology. The Third Hour (Terce), the Sixth Hour (Sext), and the Ninth Hour (None) and their Inter-Hours each follow the same basic outline as the First Hour. Before or after the Ninth Hour (depending upon the liturgical season), an office called the Typica is recited. The Typica is only chanted on days when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated, and consists of many of the psalms and hymns that would have been chanted had the Liturgy been celebrated. Ordinarily this consists of Psalm 102, Psalm 145, and the Beatitudes, followed by prayers and hymns. But in the seasons of fasting this Office is regulated by different rubrics. Sequences The Sequences supply for all the Acolouths of the Daily Cycle the material required for a particular Remembrance — that is to say, the material proper to a particular day of the week, a particular date of the year, a particular day in the liturgical seasons (for instance, during Great Lent or the period between Pascha (Easter) and Pentecost). These sequences can be referred to as cycles. The fundamental element of the Sequence is the troparion, which is a short hymn, or one of the stanzas of a hymn. The kontakion is a troparion which explains briefly the character of the feast celebrated in the day's Office. The oikos is a somewhat longer troparion, which follows after the kontakion and in concise style glorifies the virtues and merits of the subject of the feast which were treated in the kontakion. The apolytikion is a troparion which is proper to the day, and is said just before the dismissal. The ode was originally one of the nine inspired canticles sung in the morning Office, but later the name was also given to compositions consisting of a varying number of poetical troparia and modelled after the Scriptural odes. Such odes are often combined to form a canon (kanon) which is usually composed of nine, but sometimes of a smaller number of odes. Finally, the stichos is a short verse taken from the Psalms or some other book of Holy Scripture, while the sticheron is a short verse of ecclesiastical composition modelled after the stichos.

In 2013, Severn School merged with nearby Chesapeake Academy. Currently the school enrolls boys and girls from pre-kindergarten through grade 12. Athletics The Severn Admirals compete in thirteen varsity sports: sailing, lacrosse, cross country running, football, wrestling, soccer, basketball, swimming, baseball, golf, tennis, field hockey, and track and field in the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association. Severn has 35 varsity, junior varsity, and middle school teams. Campus On Severn's 19-acre upper school and middle school campus, there are several academic buildings, including Teel Academic Center and Creeden Hall connected by elevated glass bridges on the upper floors. Teel Academic Center underwent a complete renovation in 2015 where the original Teel Academic Center, constructed in 1969 to house boarding students, was torn down and replaced with the new 17 million dollar building. The new building houses Graw Innovation Center, a computer lab, the Zimmerman Library, and the Hoehn-Saric Center for Academic Excellence, as well as middle and upper school classrooms. Creeden Hall, constructed in 2002 as the Upper School Academic Center, contains science labs and prep rooms, a greenhouse, Roche Lecture Hall, classrooms, two computer labs, and several spaces for students such as Creeden Commons. Also on this campus is McCleary Student Center which houses Price Auditorium, Bauer Dining Hall, Powell Conference Room, and several arts classrooms for both the middle and upper school. In 2012, construction was completed on the Stine Outdoor Education Center, a 2-acre space behind the two academic buildings featuring a tiered outdoor classroom, trails, a counsel ring, challenge course with low ropes to promote team building, and an artist's reflection area. Severn School has also finished the process of constructing the Edward St. John Athletic Center. The facility, opened April 2008, cost about $10 million. Alongside the completion of this building was the construction of two turf fields, one for field hockey and lacrosse,and one for football and soccer,The Severn Binnacle 2007 to accompany two more grass athletic fields. The Chesapeake Campus in Arnold houses Severn's Lower School. On that campus are Flinchum Gymnasium, Troy Media Center, and Sivvy Theatre. There are 2 fully equipped outdoor playgrounds, an outdoor science learning area, learning pavilion, and trike and scooter path for early childhood students.

Not to scale. On 10 September 1976, British Airways Flight 476, a Hawker Siddeley Trident en route from London to Istanbul, collided mid-air near Zagreb, Yugoslavia (modern-day Croatia), with Inex-Adria Aviopromet Flight 550, a Douglas DC-9 en route from Split, Yugoslavia, to Cologne, West Germany. The collision was the result of a procedural error on the part of Zagreb air traffic controllers. All 176 people aboard the two aircraft were killed, making it, at the time, the world's deadliest mid-air collision. It is the deadliest aviation accident in both Croatia and Yugoslavia.  Flights  British Airways Flight 476 departed London Heathrow Airport for Istanbul Atatürk Airport at 08:32 UTC as flight BA476, with 54 passengers on board and a crew of 9. At the controls of the Trident 3B was an experienced captain, Dennis Tann (born 1932), who by the time of the accident had accumulated 10,781 flying hours. He was assisted by first officer Brian Helm and acting first officer Martin Flint. Inex-Adria Flight 550 departed Split Airport at 09:48 UTC bound for Cologne Bonn Airport as flight JP550. It carried 108 passengers, mostly German holiday-makers returning home at the end of a holiday on the Dalmatian coast, and a crew of 5. At the controls sat captain Jože Krumpak (born 1925), an experienced pilot with 10,157 flying hours, and first officer Dušan Ivanuš. Inex-Adria was a charter airline based in Slovenia, the northernmost of the constituent republics making up the federation of Yugoslavia. Both flights proceeded uneventfully until they approached the Zagreb VOR.  Air traffic control  In the mid-1970s, the Zagreb air traffic control region was one of the busiest in Europe despite being seriously undermanned and poorly equipped. The Zagreb VOR was a reporting point for a number of congested airways between northern Europe and southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and beyond. The airspace was divided into three sectors by altitude: the lower sector below , the middle sector from , and the upper sector above .  Accident  On entering Yugoslav airspace from Austria, BA476 established radio contact with the Zagreb ACC upper-sector controller Gradimir Tasić at 10:04:12 UTC, informing him that they were at and expected to reach the Zagreb VOR at 10:14. The controller responded by instructing them to select transponder code 2312, and to call again on reaching the VOR: { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font- size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:04:12  BA476  Zagreb, Bealine 476, good morning. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"   Zagreb Upp  Bealine 476, good morning, go ahead. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:04:19  BA476  Er, 476, is Klagenfurt at 02, 330 and estimating Zagreb at one four. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:04:27  Zagreb Upp  Bealine 476, roger, call me passing Zagreb, flight level 330, Squawk Alpha 2312. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:04:40  BA476  2312 is coming. } This was the last communication with the Trident aircraft before the accident. At around the same time, JP550 contacted middle-sector controller Bojan Erjavec asking for a higher flight level; the aircraft was at . FL280 and FL310 were unavailable, so Erjavec informed JP550 of the situation and offered , which the pilots accepted. To get clearance for a higher level, it was necessary to obtain the permission of the upper-sector controller. Erjavec waved his hand to get Tasić's attention, but Tasić (who was working the upper sector on his own, as co-worker Mladen Hochberger had gone to search for Nenad Tepeš, Tasić's replacement who was running late) was far too busy to be interrupted. Middle sector controller Gradimir Pelin was then instructed to co-ordinate the climbout for the DC-9 with Tasić. According to Pelin, he walked to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight progress strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen to make sure that he had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40. Memorial to some of the dead At 10:12:03, JP550 called the Zagreb middle-sector controller to inform them that the aircraft was out of flight level 310. The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper-sector controller on 134.45 MHz and to stop squawking the assigned squawk code. By instructing JP550 to squawk Standby, Erjavec simply released a code allocated for the middle sector. The data tag for the DC-9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others. If everything about this handover had been normal, the DC-9 would have been given a new code on initial contact with the upper sector controller and would have been positively identified on the upper sector screen with its flight number and altitude readout. But this had not been a normal handover because of the ill-handled co-ordination for the climb. Also, Tasić was busy with other traffic and JP550 did not immediately contact the upper-sector controller. This could have been because the frequency was busy, but the pilots might also have delayed the call for some unknown reason. By the time JP550 contacted the upper-sector controller at 10:14:04 it had reached the Zagreb VOR and was already climbing through . The controller immediately asked for confirmation of the aircraft's level: { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font-size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:14:04  JP550  Dobar dan [\\"Good day\\"] Zagreb, Adria 550. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:14:07  Zagreb Upp  Adria 550, Zagreb, dobar dan, go ahead. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:14:10  JP550  325 crossing Zagreb at one four. - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  10:14:14  Zagreb Upp  What is your present level? - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:14:17  JP550  327. } Realising the imminent danger of collision, Tasić instructed the JP550 to stop climbing. In doing so, he reverted to his native Serbo-Croatian language, contrary to the regulations. This meant that the British Airways plane, even if they overheard this conversation, would have very little chance of understanding their own imminent danger. The controller's last-ditch attempt to avert catastrophe turned what would have been a near miss into the collision he was trying to prevent. For, by the time JP550 had levelled off it was at flight level 330, exactly the same level as BA476: { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font- size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:14:22  Zagreb Upp  ... e... zadržite se na toj visini i javite prolazak Zagreba [\\"uh... hold your current altitude and report passing Zagreb\\"]. - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  10:14:27  JP550  Kojoj visini?

[\\"OK, we'll remain precisely at 330.\\"] } The mid-air collision occurred at 10:14:41. Half a minute later, Tasić attempted to call BA476 and instruct it to report passing the next waypoint at Našice, but was answered by a different flight: { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font-size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:15:06  Zagreb Upp  Bealine 476, Zagreb... report passing Nasice. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:15:12  BE778  Beatours 778, were you calling...? - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:15:14  Zagreb Upp  Negative. } Tasić continued to call BA476 and JP550, ignoring calls from other aircraft, but to no avail: { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font-size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  10:15:50  Zagreb Upp  Adria 550, Zagreb... - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:16:00  Zagreb Upp  Adria 550, Zagreb... - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:16:14  Zagreb Upp  Adria 550, Zagreb... - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:16:32  Zagreb Upp  Adria 550, Zagreb... - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:16:42  Zagreb Upp  Adria 550, Zagreb... - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:16:50  Zagreb Upp  Bealine 476, Zagreb... - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:16:58  Zagreb Upp  Bealine 476, Zagreb... } Meanwhile, a Lufthansa Boeing 737 was travelling eastbound on UB5 at flight level 290 towards Zagreb, only 15 miles behind the Trident. The co-pilot saw the collision as a flash of lightning and afterwards, out of a ball of smoke, two aircraft falling towards the ground. The Lufthansa captain, Josef Kröse, reported the sighting to Erjavec, the middle-sector controller. { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font-size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  10:15:40  Capt Kröse R/T  ....e Zagreb! It is possible we have a mid-air collision in sight. We have two aircraft going down, well, almost below our position now. } This was spoken in such an agitated voice that Erjavec was unable to understand what was being said. (Later, on hearing the recording of this call, Captain Kröse had difficulty in understanding his own words.) The Lufthansa captain had to repeat his message several times. { style=\\"margin:auto; border:none; font-size:95%;\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - !style=\\"width:6.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:7.0em;\\" !!style=\\"width:37.0em;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  10:18:12  Capt Kröse R/T  It is possible that the other aircraft ahead of us had a mid-air collision....er...just overhead Zagreb. We had two aircraft going down with a rapid rate of descent...and there was also smoke coming out. } When the implications of what was being said dawned on Erjavec, he glanced across to the upper-sector controller. At his station sat a stunned Tasić, white-faced with shock. Slowly he lifted the headset from his ears and placed it on the console in front of him. The two aircraft had collided over the town of Vrbovec, northeast of Zagreb, the last five metres of the DC-9's left wing cutting through the Trident's cockpit section and forward passenger compartment. The explosive decompression caused the forward part of the Trident's fuselage to disintegrate; the Trident fell, landing on its tail and sliding a short distance before its remains came to rest. The DC-9, now without over one-third of its left wing, went into an immediate nose-dive and slammed into the ground right-wing first. In the end, everyone aboard both flights was killed. A police officer who was one of the first to arrive at the scene reported that a baby on the ground was \\"still giving feeble signs of life near the [British] plane, but even if the ambulances had arrived before me, it would have been too late to save it.\\"  Trial  By noon that day, all controllers were in custody for interrogation. Later, all were released except Tasić, who remained in custody until the trial. The trial opened on 11 April 1977 in Zagreb District Court. All the controllers were indicted under the Penal Code of Yugoslavia, Articles 271-72 as \\"persons who by endangering railway, sea or air traffic, threaten the lives of persons or property\\". Tasić was the only one to be found guilty; he was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. After a petition by air traffic controllers, it was determined that Tasić had been used as a scapegoat, and he was released on 29 November 1978. He had served nearly two years and three months in prison.

The valid name should be used for that taxon, instead of any other name that may currently be being used, or may previously have been used. A name name is valid when, and only when, it is in harmony with all the relevant rules listed in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). A valid name is the correct zoological name of a taxon. In contrast, a name which violates the rules of the ICZN is known as an invalid name. An invalid name is not considered to be the correct scientific name for a taxon. There are numerous different kinds of invalid names.  Subjectively invalid names  Subjectively invalid names are names that have been rendered invalid by individual scientific judgement or opinion. Taxonomists may differ in their opinion, and names considered invalid by one researcher may be considered valid by another; thus these are still potentially valid names. They include: :*Junior subjective synonyms - synonyms described from different types, which were previously described as separate taxa, but are now understood to be the same taxon. :*Junior secondary homonyms - In this case, the taxa are separate species, but they were previous classified in separate genera, and by chance they had been given the same specific name. When they came to occupy the same genus, this resulted in homonymy . :*Conditionally suppressed names - these are special cases where a name which would otherwise have been valid has been petitioned for suppression by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. This is usually because the junior synonym (the later name) has had far wider and far longer common usage than the senior synonym (the older name).  Objectively invalid names  Objectively invalid names are names that have been rendered invalid for factual reasons. These names are universally accepted as invalid, and are not merely a matter of individual opinion, as is the case with subjectively invalid names. They include: :*Junior objective synonyms - names describing a taxon (the junior synonym) that have already been described by another name earlier (the senior synonym). ICZN follows the Principle of Priority, in which the oldest available name is applied in preference to newer names where possible. :*Junior homonyms in the family and genus group - names of families and genera which have the same spelling, but refer to different taxa. :*Junior primary homonyms in a species group - species synonyms resulting from two different organisms being originally described with the same name which was spelled in the same way. Compare with the previously discussed junior secondary homonyms. :*Completely suppressed names - are special cases where a name is completely suppressed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. It is treated as if it had never been published, and is never to be used, regardless of the actual availability. :*Partially suppressed names - are special cases where a name is partially suppressed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Unlike completely suppressed names, partially suppressed names are still acknowledged as having been published but is used only for the purpose of homonymy, not priority. Different rules for botany Under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the term validly published name has a different meaning that corresponds to zoology's available name.

Results of excavations have been interpreted as to account for the construction of shelters by humans during the Lower Paleolithic period. Research teams have unearthed more than 20,000 fossilized faunal bone fragments. Two hundred thousand year old cranial fragments of a nine year old juvenile found in the cave suggest the presence of either Homo heidelbergensis or a proto- Neanderthal human. The possible shelter Occupation layers of the cave in use during marine isotopic stage 6 (186,000 to 127,000 years ago) were excavated during the 1970s and may demonstrate construction abilities and other organisational skills by the inhabitants at the time. Close to the mouth of the cave and along one wall were found Acheulean stone tools along with fragments of animal bone surrounding two circular charcoal concentrations which likely served as hearths. This occupation area measures and was delimited by the cave wall on three sides and on the fourth by a sinuous line of large stones. It is these which have been interpreted as having served as packing stones that could have been used to support the poles of an animal skin tent pitched against the cave wall. No evidence of the organic tent poles or tent itself would have survived but stone tool flakes and animal bone appear to spill outwards from between the stones at two points which may represent entrances to the conjectured shelter. Finds of tiny sea shells surrounding the hearths may represent seaweed brought into the cave to serve as bedding. This may indicate specialised activity areas within the settlement with an inner domestic area and an outer one which would have been covered by the tent but presumably used for another purpose. It is by no means certain that the stones were brought into the cave and placed by people however and natural processes or a reason for their placement not involving a structure may explain their presence. The limited evidence from nearby sites where similar stone tools and other cultural material have been found close to concentrations of natural rocks is less compelling than at Le Lazaret. Examples of these similar sites include La Baume Bonne (in Quinson, Alpes-de- Haute-Provence) and Orgnac. The evidence for housing in the archaeological record prior to the arrival of modern humans 50,000 years ago is slim, although any flimsy structure built prior to this time is unlikely to leave unmistakable archaeological traces after so long.

It usually has the appearance of grey powder, composed of spherical microparticles. Most of the impurities are carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. BASF invented carbonyl iron powder in 1925 and claims to be the world's leading producer. In 1934, BASF was also involved in the development of the very first magnetic tapes used by the AEG Magnetophon tape recorder. Carbonyl iron became the first magnetic recording oxide (although quickly replaced in 1936 by iron oxide). In electronics, carbonyl iron is used to manufacture magnetic cores for high- frequency coils and in production of some ferrites. Spherical particles manufactured of carbonyl iron are used as a component of the radar absorbing materials used by the military, in stealth vehicles, for example. Other uses are in powder metallurgy, metal injection molding, and in various specialty products. Powdered cores made of carbonyl iron have high stability of parameters across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic flux levels, with excellent Q factors between 50 kHz and 200 MHz. A popular application is in broadband inductors, especially in high-power applications. In pharmaceutics, carbonyl iron powder is used to treat iron deficiency and as an iron dietary supplement.

While very large floating structures have been constructed or proposed in real life, aerial cities and islands remain in the realm of fiction. Seaborne cities and islands Seaborne floating islands have been found in literature since Homer's Odyssey, written near the end of the 8th century BC, described the island of Aeolia. They reappear in Pliny the Elder's Natural History of the 1st century AD. Richard Head‘s 1673 novel The Floating Island describes a fictional island named Scotia Moria. In the DC comics story of Wonder Woman, Themyscira is a group of floating islands. In Jules Verne‘s Propeller Island, the characters are on an artificial floating island that is actually a huge ship. In Yann Martel‘s novel Life of Pi, there is a floating island. Airborne cities and islands A fictional vision from 1922 of a floating city in 10,000 years. =Earth= In the treatise De Grandine et Tonitruis (\\"On Hail and Thunder\\", 815), Carolingian bishop Agobard of Lyon describes Magonia, a cloud realm populated by felonious aerial sailors. In the novel Gulliver's Travels (1726) by Jonathan Swift, it depicted Laputa, an island city that floated in the sky. Laputa purportedly levitated through use of artificial magnetism. It was primarily a fictional device that was intended to satirize far-fetched pseudo- scientific proposals. During the 1920s, science fiction author Hugo Gernsback speculated about floating cities of the future, suggesting that 10,000 years hence \\"the city the size of New York will float several miles above the surface of the earth, where the air is cleaner and purer and free from disease carrying bacteria.\\" To stay in the air, \\"four gigantic generators will shoot earthward electric rays which by reaction with the earth produce the force to keep the city aloft.\\" In 1960, the architects Buckminster Fuller and Shoji Sadao proposed the construction of a thermal airship, which they called Cloud Nine. This megastructure would be a geodesic sphere that, once it was sufficiently heated by sunlight, would become airborne. Fuller and Sadao envisioned that Cloud Nine would float freely in the Earth's atmosphere, giving residents and passengers a migratory lifestyle. They believed that it might be a partial solution to the depletion of non-renewable resources. The \\"Triton City\\" was the work of the Triton Foundation whose principal members were Buckminster Fuller and Shoji Sadao, was commissioned by HUD, a federal agency, by its director, Charles Haar, a Harvard professor, to design a floating city to provide housing in urban areas located near the ocean. A tetrahedron shaped module holding 5,000 inhabitants was designed and a comprehensive engineering report was submitted together with a large model which is on display in the lobby of the Lyndon B. Johnson Center in Austin, Texas.https://archpaper.com/2016/08/radical-seafaring-parrish- catalogue/#gallery-0-slide-0 Eric Vinicoff's \\"Maiden Flight\\" postulates a remarkably optimistic view of a post-nuclear apocalyptic world in which humanity has either retreated underground or taken to the skies in 'windriders', essentially large (approx. 1-mile diameter) tensigrity bubbles that employ a hot-air lift mechanism. These windriders may also qualify as arcologies as they are, for all practical purposes, self-sustaining. In Isaac Asimov's story Shah Guido G., the hereditary Secretary-General of the United Nations (\\"Sekjen\\") is a tyrant who rules the Earth from a Flying island called Atlantis. =Venus= A design similar to Fuller's Cloud Nine might permit habitation in the upper atmosphere of Venus, where at ground level the temperature is too high and the atmospheric pressure too great. As proposed by Geoffrey A. Landis, the easiest planet (other than Earth) to place floating cities at this point would appear to be Venus. Because the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere is 50% denser than air, breathable air (21:79 Oxygen- Nitrogen mixture) is a lifting gas in the dense Venerean atmosphere, with over 60% of the lifting power that helium has on Earth. In effect, a balloon full of human-breathable air would sustain itself and extra weight (such as a colony) in midair. This means that any large structure filled with air would float on the carbon dioxide, with the air's natural buoyancy counteracting the weight of the structure itself. At an altitude of 50 km above the Venerean surface, the environment is the \\"most Earthlike in the solar system\\",Landis, quoted in Atkinson op. cit. with a pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C-50°C range. Because there is not a significant pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the breathable-air balloon, any rips or tears would cause gases to diffuse at normal atmospheric mixing rates, giving time to repair any such damage. In addition, humans would not require pressurized suits when outside, merely air to breathe and a protection from the acidic rain. Since such colonies would be viable in current Venerean conditions, this allows a dynamic approach to colonization instead of requiring extensive terraforming measures in advance. The main challenge would be using a substance resistant to sulfuric acid to serve as the structure's outer layer; ceramics or metal sulfates could possibly serve in this role. =Other planets= In addition to Venus, floating cities have been proposed in science fiction on several other planets. For example, floating cities might also permit settlement of the outer three gas giants, as the gas giants lack solid surfaces. Jupiter is not promising for habitation due to its high gravity, escape velocity and radiation, but the solar system's other gas giants (Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) may be more practical. In 1978, the British Interplanetary Society's Project Daedalus envisioned floating factories in the atmospheres of Jupiter refining helium-3 to produce fuel for an interstellar probe. Michael McCollum notes that the \\"surface\\" gravity of Saturn (that is, at the visible cloud layer, where the atmospheric pressure is about the same as Earth's) is very close to that of Earth, and in his novel The Clouds of Saturn, he envisioned cities floating in the Saturnian atmosphere, where the buoyancy is provided by envelopes of hydrogen heated by fusion reactors. Uranus and Neptune also have upper atmosphere gravities comparable to Earth's, and even lower escape velocities than Saturn. Cecelia Holland populated Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus with mutant humans, the Styth, in floating cities in her only SF novel, Floating Worlds (1975). Donald Moffitt's novel Jovian (2003) features floating cities forever floating in the Jovian atmosphere, a worthwhile enterprise due to their ability to extract useful gases. The book concentrates on the cultural differences (and political tensions) developing between \\"Jovian\\" humans and Earthbound ones.

He is the Antichrist and the son of the Devil. The character has been portrayed by Harvey Spencer Stephens, Jonathan Scott-Taylor, Sam Neill, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick and Bradley James. Appearances *The Omen (1976) *Damien: Omen II (1978) *Omen III: The Final Conflict (1981) *The Omen (2006, remake) *Damien (TV series) Name etymology The name \\"Damien\\" sounds vaguely like the English \\"demon\\", but is not at all etymologically related (it means something like \\"the one who subdues\\"). Damien is the French form of the English name Damian (related to the Greek verb damao, meaning \\"to tame\\"), popular as the name of a martyred Christian saint of the third century (see Saints Cosmas and Damian). Another prominent Damien was Father Damien of Hawaii, who died while establishing leper colonies there. Damien is also the first name of Father Karras in The Exorcist. Fictional biography In the first film, but not its 2006 remake, Damien was born on the sixth day of June at six o'clock in the morning, from a jackal that died giving birth to him and was buried in Cerveteri under the alias Maria Scianna (in the remake this alias was changed to Maria Avedici Santoya). The orphaned Damien is then adopted by the future American ambassador to Great Britain Robert Thorn, who was told his child was stillborn, with his wife Katherine unaware of the replacement. It would be five years later, after Thorn becomes US ambassador to the Court of St. James's, that Damien's powers begin to manifest when his nanny mysteriously hangs herself at his birthday party, claiming to have done it for him. The strange events continue with new nanny Ms. Baylock, who is later revealed to be one of the Satanists who have been waiting for the boy and acting on his behalf from the shadows, as Damien's true nature starts to manifest, from his violent reaction to church to most animals reacting fearfully at the sight of him (save for the black dog that Ms. Baylock adopted). Father Brennan, a priest from Italy who was present at Damien's birth, warns Robert about his son being the Antichrist, stating that Damien would eventually kill him and his wife. But Robert refuses to accept it until Katherine, revealed to be pregnant with another child, is hospitalized after being knocked off a balcony by Damien with his tricycle, a fall that kills the unborn baby. Accompanied by photojournalist Keith Jennings, who is eventually decapitated in a freak accident, Robert learns both the truth of Damien's heritage and the fact that his own child was actually murdered to ensure Damien's being placed in his care, so that he may rise up through the world of politics. An exorcist in Megiddo, Israel named Karl Bugenhagen gives Robert seven ancient daggers he inherited that can kill the Antichrist. Robert is initially against killing the boy until he finds the 666 birthmark that confirms his identity as the Antichrist. But when Robert brings Damien to a church to commit the deed, he is killed by police before Damien is harmed. At Robert's funeral, Damien is seen in the company of the President of the United States before being adopted by his uncle, Richard Thorn. To ensure that the last of his enemies are dealt with, Damien's subconscious will kills off Bugenhagen, who attempted to have Michael Morgan deliver a box containing the Daggers of Megiddo to Richard before the two were buried alive in the ruins. In the second film, set seven years after the first movie, the twelve-year-old Damien lives with his uncle's family: Richard's second wife, Ann, and his son from his first marriage, Mark. Originally, as with the first film, Damien is unaware of his powers, subconsciously killing any who learn his secret and pose a threat to him. Furthermore, besides Ms. Baylock, Damien is supported by other Satanic acolytes who eventually help him learn his true nature during his time in military school. Though frightened at first, Damien accepts his unholy lineage and his destiny, though it's with reluctance that he kills Mark when the latter learns the truth and refuses to join him. Though disbelieving Damien's lineage at first, Richard learns the truth and attempts to set a trap for Damien, to kill him with the Daggers of Megiddo. But Ann, revealed to be a Satanist, kills Richard before Damien incinerates her out of disgust while burning the Thorn museum to the ground. From there, as revealed in the third film, Damien eventually takes over his uncle's company and turns it into a global business corporation. By the events of Omen III: The Final Conflict, revealed to have attended Oxford, the adult Damien arranges his appointment as Ambassador to Great Britain and overseer of the United Nations Youth Associations. But his reason for taking on his father's position is that England is where the Second Coming will occur during an alignment in the Cassiopeia constellation and he needs to find and kill the Christ-child before his power completely wanes. While dealing with assassins under Father DeCarlo, who each possess a dagger of Megiddo salvaged from the ruins of the Thorn museum, Damien has his numerous followers kill every male English child born on the morning of March 24. But the Christ-child is revealed to have eluded Damien's followers. But another hindrance to his dominion comes from journalist Kate Reynolds and her adolescent son Peter, Damien's fascination with them proving to be his undoing as he is eventually killed when Reynolds stabs him in the back while he attempts to kill DeCarlo (after using Peter as a shield). Damien lives long enough to see a vision of Christ and dies telling Him that He has won nothing. In Omen IV: The Awakening, Damien is revealed to have a biological child in Delia, who was originally assumed to be the Antichrist reborn. According to the plot of the previous film, the Kingdom of Christ began much earlier and Armageddon was not prevented, but on the contrary suspended. And that means that soon Armageddon will resume from scratch. However, the Satanists who are responsible for orchestrating Delia's birth reveal that she is actually the protector of the new Antichrist, her embryonic twin brother(which is very similar to Second Coming, but from the side of evil), who was inside her body before being transferred into Delia's adoptive mother Karen. Once born, the newborn Alexander York survives his mother's death, after which he, Delia, and their father Gene attend Karen's funeral. The Omen remakes A Hollywood remake was made featuring Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick. The plot of the remake closely follows that of the original film. The Omen was also remade in Tamil in 1991 under the title Jenma Natchathiram. Analysis George Ochoa, in his book Deformed and Destructive Beings: The Purpose of Horror Films, identifies Damien Thorn from The Omen films as a \\"deformed and destructive being\\". Ochoa writes that horror film audiences possess an ambivalence of horror and delight over the continued existence of the film's \\"monster\\". He says of Damien, \\"It is horrifying to realize that the boy survived the final battle with his adoptive father... but it is also pleasing, because Damien—in company with... [the] ever-present Satan—is a well-realized DDB.\\" He says the presentation of Damien as a character in the original The Omen is accentuated by his defeat of his adoptive father, who is played by Gregory Peck, known for leading man and heroic roles. In the remake, however, Damien defeats his adoptive father, played by Liev Schreiber, who is \\"not associated with playing heroes\\". Ochoa concludes, \\"The result was that [Schreiber's character's] defeat by the little boy was neither exceptional nor horrifying, just forgettable.\\" James F. Iaccino analyzed Damien in The Omen with Jungian psychology, \\"To paraphrase Jung, his psyche is animalistic, primordial, and monstrous to behold. It further contains within its very core an awesome supernatural element, setting the bearer apart from all others.\\" Since Damien is an orphan on Earth, his survival means he has \\"accomplished something truly godlike\\". When Damien uses his powers, Iaccino says \\"they are typically accompanied by a fierceness and rage\\" that reflects the Jungian interpretation of \\"the primordial child's being depicted as an inhuman\\". Damien has a relationship with wild dogs that indicates \\"his mystical link with the barbaric world of the primitive\\". Iaccino says that Damien's life (in the original film) is spared because Damien \\"can appear angelic and pure to those around him while concealing his depraved nature\\", which is why his adoptive father hesitates to kill him. In Omen II, Iaccino notes Damien's relationship with the raven, which \\"is one of the devil's common guises\\" in fairy tales. When satanists help educate Damien \\"in the ways of evil\\", the growing boy becomes fully conscious of his true nature. Iaccino explains, \\"He is able to detach himself somewhat from the instinctual sphere of the beast (as well as the innocence of the child) to develop a stronger, more liberating identity.\\" After Damien's realization, the raven no longer appears in the film, indicating that it has been \\"integrated into Damien's conscience\\". In Omen III: The Final Conflict, Damien is an adult with an empire that thrives \\"on the misfortunes of others\\". He lacks faith or trust in others and does not want to admit needing anyone to survive. When he questions the Christ replica, he is \\"the Jungian image of archaic man\\" who believes that any action \\"must produce a significant reaction in the world\\", which is why he forces the crown of thorns on the replica's head.

He is known for his martyr’s death at the hands of the Persian shah Abbas I. The Georgian Orthodox Church regards him as saint and marks his memory on the day of his death, July 1. Life Luarsab ascended the Kartlian throne at the age of 14 after his father, Giorgi X, suddenly died in 1606. During his minority, the government was actually run by a royal tutor Shadiman Baratashvili. It was when Abbas I succeeded in driving the Ottoman armies out of eastern Georgia, leaving a Persian force in Tbilisi, and confirming Luarsab as king of Kartli. The Ottomans attempted to remove Luarsab, sending in Georgia a large army, only to be destroyed by the Georgian general Giorgi Saakadze at the Battle of Tashiskari, 1609. After this victory, Luarsab was granted again the control of the citadel of Tbilisi and the shah married his sister Tinatin, 1610. Late in 1611, Luarsab himself married Makrine, a sister of a lower-class noble Saakadze. The great nobles of the realm led by Shadiman Baratashvili convinced the king that Saakadze was a Persian agent seeking a royal crown. They induced Luarsab to divorce Makrine and forced Saakadze into exile to Persia. Shah Abbas indeed demanded more loyalty and obedience from the Georgians and encouraged a khan of Kazakh Mohammad to trouble the Kartlian lands. In 1612, Luarsab had Mohammad Khan assassinated and allied with another Georgian monarch, Teimuraz I of Kakheti to counter an anticipated Persian aggression. Early in 1614, a large Persian army invaded Kakheti, destroying several settlements on its way, and moved into Kartli. Luarsab and Teimuraz fled to a western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti. George III of Imereti refused to surrender the refugees. Abbas threatened Kartli with ruin, promising that if Luarsab submitted, he would conclude a peace. In October 1615, Luarsab surrendered to save his kingdom from being wiped out, and, refusing to convert to Islam, was incarcerated first in Astarabad and then somewhere near Shiraz. The Georgians attempted to free their king through the mediation of Tsar Mikhail I of Russia. However, the negotiations yielded no results and, in 1622, Luarsab was executed (strangled with a bow string) on the orders of the shah at the fortress of Qal‘eh-ye Golāb in southwest Iran.

Acquapendente is a centre for the agricultural production of vegetables and wine, and has a tradition of pottery craftsmanship. History The area of modern Acquapendente was settled by Etruscans in Roman times, as archaeological finds have shown. However, the first historical document of the modern city dates from the 9th century AD, with a town named Farisa or Arisa along the Via Francigena. A document from Emperor Otto I, dated 964, contains the first recorded use of the name Acquapendentem which means \\"hanging water\\", from several small waterfalls in the Paglia river on the boundary between Lazio and Tuscany. Torre Alfina, about 8 kilometers east of Acquapendente Acquapendente was the first stop in Italy in the travels of Saint Roch in the early 14th century; the saint supposedly spent several days in the hospital there curing plague victims.Francesco Diedo, Vita Sancti Rochi (1478), translated by Irene Vaslef, in Irene Vaslef, \\"The Role of St. Roch as a Plague Saint: A Medieval Hagiographic Tradition\\" (PhD diss., Catholic University, 1984), 198. The city was later part of the March of Tuscany and, from the end of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th, it was part of the commune (later Republic) of Siena. In 1449 it became an independent centre within the Papal States. After the complete destruction of Castro, Lazio in 1649, Acquapendente, previously part of the diocese of Orvieto, became the seat of a diocese that included what had been the diocese of Castro.Giuseppe Cappelletti, Le Chiese d'Italia dalla loro origine sino ai nostri giorni, Venezia 1846, vol.

Very heavy, as matrix is pure uraninite (steel-gray). Shinkolobwe is the type locality for schoepite and curite. Ex-Carnegie Museum of Natural History, removed from display for being \\"too hot\\"(radioactive). Size: 14.0 x 10.0 x 7.2 cm. Uranophane in malachite specimen from the Shinkolobwe mine Shinkolobwe, or Kasolo, or Chinkolobew, or Shainkolobwe, is a radium and uranium mine in the Haut-Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), located 20 km west of Likasi, 20 km south of Kambove, and about 145 km northwest of Lubumbashi. The mine produced uranium ore for the Manhattan Project. It was officially closed in 2004. History Shinkolobwe is the name of a nearby village, long since gone, and the name of an indigenous thorny fruit. It is also slang for \\"a man who is easygoing on the surface but who becomes angry when provoked\\". The mineral deposit was discovered in 1915 by English geologist Robert Rich Sharp (1881–1958). Robert Rich Sharp, En prospection au Katanga il y a cinquante ans, Elisabethville, 1956.Hogarth, Donald, Robert Rich Sharp (1881–1958): prospector, engineer, and discoverer of the Shinkolobwe, Katanga, (Congo) radium-uranium ore-body, Society for the History of Discoveries The mine was worked from 1921 onwards. Uranium-bearing ore was initially exported to Olen, Belgium for the extraction of radium, and uranium. Only the richest ore was sent to Olen, with the remainder held in reserve. Open-cut mining was suspended at level 57 m and at the level 79 m underground in 1936, though exploration had commenced at level 114 m, and water pumps installed at level 150 m. Both Britain and France expressed interest in the Belgium inventory of uranium ore in 1939. Nothing further happened though after the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940, gaining control of the ore still \\"on the docks\\". Open-cut operations restarted in 1944, and underground in 1945. This required pumping the mine dry since the water table was at about 45 m. The 255 m level was reached in 1955. =Uranium for the Manhattan Project= The United States used Shinkolobwe's uranium resources to supply the Manhattan Project to construct the atomic bomb in World War II. Edgar Sengier, then director of Union Minière du Haut Katanga, had stockpiled 1,200 tonnes of uranium ore in a warehouse on Staten Island, New York. This ore and an additional 3,000 tonnes of ore stored above-ground at the mine was purchased by Colonel Ken Nichols for use in the project. Nichols wrote:Nichols, K. D. The Road to Trinity pages 44-47 (1987, Morrow, New York) In 1940, 1,200 tons of stockpiled uranium ore were shipped to the US by Sengier's African Metals Corp., a commercial arm of Union Miniere. Then, after the September 1942 agreement with Nichols, an average of 400 tons of uranium oxide were shipped to the US each month. Initially, the port of Lobito was used to ship the ore, but later Matadi was used to improve security. Only two shipments were lost at sea. The aerodromes in Elizabethville and Leopoldville were also expanded. Additionally, the mine was reopened with the help of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which involved draining the water and retooling the facility. Finally, the Office of Strategic Services were enlisted to deal with the threat of smuggling to Germany. American interest in the Shinkolobwe mine for the purpose of developing of nuclear weapons led to the implementation of extensive security measures. Shinkolobwe's location was removed from maps and journalists were denied access to the mine and official information. = Postwar = Just as a lack of uranium ore impeded the German and Japanese attempts to make an atomic bomb, the Americans wanted to maintain their monopoly against the Soviets. Security measures were slightly more relaxed in the wake of World War II, but in the 1950s, most journalists were able to gather only scraps of information on the mine's operation, from unofficial sources. In 1950, a uranium processing plant was said to be under construction near the mine. At the time, Shinkolobwe was believed to contain roughly half of the world's known reserves of uranium. In 1947, the U.S. received 1,440 tons of uranium concentrates from the Belgian Congo, 2,792 in 1951, and 1,600 in 1953. A processing plant was added nearby, and for increased security, a garrison was also established, with a supporting NATO military base in Kamina. Jadotville became a security checkpoint for foreigners. However, by the time of Congo independence, Union Miniere had sealed the mine with concrete. =Closure= The mine was officially closed on January 28, 2004, by presidential decree. However eight people died and a further thirteen people were injured in July 2004 when part of the old mine collapsed. Although industrial production has ceased with cement lids sealing off the mine shafts, there is evidence that some artisanal mining still goes on here. A United Nations inter-agency mission, led by the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and organised through their Joint Environment Unit, visited the mine. The UNEP/OCHA concluded: =\\"Uranium for Iran\\" allegation= On July 18, 2006, the DRC Sanctions Committee (United Nations Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004), to give it its full name) released a report dated June 15, 2006, which stated that artisanal mining for various minerals continues at the Shinkolobwe mine: On August 9, 2006, the Sunday Times published a report claiming that Iran was seeking to import \\"bomb-making uranium\\" from the Shinkolobwe mine,Iran's plot to mine uranium in Africa Sunday Times, August 9, 2006 quoting the UN report of July 18, 2006. It gives \\"Tanzanian customs officials\\" as its sole source for the claim that the uranium was destined for processing in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan via the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Douglas Farah has compared this to North Korean attempts to get uranium from the same mine.The DRC and Uranium for Iran. Retrieved August 19, 2006. Geology Shinkolobwe vein geologic cross section showing successive layers of uranyl minerals The formations of the Shinkolobwe ore deposit form a spur of the Mine Series wedged into a fold-fault. Uranium minerals, and associated cobalt, silver, nickel, bismuth and arsenic, occur as massive sulfide ore in veinlets along fractures, joints, and minor faults within the Katanga synclinorium. Uraninite mineralization occurred 630 Ma, when uraniferous solutions percolated into the dolomitic shales of the Precambrian Mine Series (Serie des Mines), under the Roche Argilotalqueuse (R.A.T.) nappe. The Mine Series is a Schist-Dolomite System postulated to be in the Roan System. This schistose-dolomite appears structurally between two contacts of the Kundelungu System, the Middle Kundelungu and the Lower Kundelungu, of the Katanga Group. The Lower and Upper Kundelungu form a double syncline, the northern limb of which overlies the Shinkolobwe Fault. These structural complexities aside, the Katanga stratigraphic column consists, top to bottom, of the Precambrian Kundelungu System (Upper, Middle and Lower), the Grand Congomerate and Mwashya Systems, the Schist-Dolomite System (Roan System-Mine Series of R.G.S., C.M.N., S.D., R.S.C., R.S.F., D. Strat., R.A.T. Gr., and R.A.T.) and the Kibara Group. Uraninite crystals from 1 to 4 centimeter cubes were common. New minerals identified here include ianthinite, becquerelite, schoepite, curite, fourmarierite, masuyite, vandendriesscheite, richetite, billietite, vandenbrandeite, kasolite, soddyite, sklodowskite, cuprosklodowskite, dewindtite, dumontite, renardite, parsonsite, saleite, sharpite, studtite, and diderichite. Similar uraninite deposits occur 36 km west at Swampo, and 120 km west at Kalongwe. Surface ores consist of oxidized minerals from supergene alteration above the water table and the formation of uranyl minerals. Below the water table, hypogene ores include uraninite (pitchblende), Co-Ni sulfides and selenides.

Provision of an onion site also helps mitigate SSL stripping attacks by malicious exit nodes on the Tor network upon users who would otherwise access traditional HTTPS clearnet sites over Tor.  Format  Addresses in the .onion TLD are generally opaque, non-mnemonic, 16- or 56-character alpha-semi-numerical strings which are automatically generated based on a public key when an onion service is configured. These strings can be made up of any letter of the alphabet, and decimal digits from 2 to 7, representing in base32 either an 80-bit hash (\\"version 2\\", or 16-character) or an ed25519 public key (\\"version 3\\", \\"next gen\\", or 56-character). As a result, all combinations of sixteen base32 characters could potentially be valid version 2 addresses (though as the output of a cryptographic hash, a randomly selected string of this form having a corresponding onion service should be extremely unlikely), while only combinations of 56 base32 characters that correctly encoded an ed25519 public key, a checksum, and a version number (i.e., 3) are valid version 3 addresses. It is possible to set up a human- readable .onion URL (e.g. starting with an organization name) by generating massive numbers of key pairs (a computational process that can be parallelized) until a sufficiently desirable URL is found. The \\"onion\\" name refers to onion routing, the technique used by Tor to achieve a degree of anonymity.  WWW to .onion gateways  Proxies into the Tor network like Tor2web allow access to onion services from non-Tor browsers and for search engines that are not Tor-aware. By using a gateway, users give up their own anonymity and trust the gateway to deliver the correct content. Both the gateway and the onion service can fingerprint the browser, and access user IP address data. Some proxies use caching techniques to provide better page- loading than the official Tor Browser.  .exit (defunct pseudo-top-level domain)  .exit was a pseudo-top-level domain used by Tor users to indicate on the fly to the Tor software the preferred exit node that should be used while connecting to a service such as a web server, without having to edit the configuration file for Tor (torrc). The syntax used with this domain was hostname + .exitnode + .exit, so that a user wanting to connect to http://www.torproject.org/ through node tor26 would have to enter the URL http://www.torproject.org.tor26.exit. Example uses for this would include accessing a site available only to addresses of a certain country or checking if a certain node is working. Users could also type exitnode.exit alone to access the IP address of exitnode. The .exit notation was deprecated as of version 0.2.9.8. It is disabled by default as of version 0.2.2.1-alpha due to potential application-level attacks, and with the release of 0.3-series Tor as \\"stable\\" may now be considered defunct.  Official designation  The domain was formerly a pseudo-top-level domain host suffix, similar in concept to such endings as .bitnet and .uucp used in earlier times. On 9 September 2015 ICANN, IANA and the IETF designated .onion as a 'special use domain', giving the domain an official status following a proposal from Jacob Appelbaum of the Tor Project and Facebook security engineer Alec Muffett.  HTTPS support  Prior to the adoption of CA/Browser Forum Ballot 144, a HTTPS certificate for a .onion name could only be acquired by treating .onion as an Internal Server Name. Per the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements, these certificates could be issued, but were required to expire before 1 November 2015. Despite these restrictions, DuckDuckGo launched an onion site with a self-signed certificate in July 2013; Facebook obtained the first SSL Onion certificate to be issued by a Certificate authority in October 2014, Blockchain.info in December 2014, and The Intercept in April 2015. The New York Times later joined in October 2017. Following the adoption of CA/Browser Forum Ballot 144 and the designation of the domain as 'special use' in September 2015, .onion meets the criteria for RFC 6761. Certificate authorities may issue SSL certificates for HTTPS .onion sites per the process documented in the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements, introduced in Ballot 144. As of August 2016, 13 onion domains are https signed across 7 different organisations via DigiCert.

According to author Michael W. Lucas, OpenBSD \\"is widely regarded as the most secure operating system available anywhere, under any licensing terms.\\"  API and build changes  Bugs and security flaws are often caused by programmer error. A common source of error is the misuse of the \`strcpy\` and \`strcat\` string functions in the C programming language. There are two common alternatives, \`strncpy\` and \`strncat\`, but they can be difficult to understand and easy to misuse, so OpenBSD developers Todd C. Miller and Theo de Raadt designed the \`strlcpy\` and \`strlcat\` functions. These functions are intended to make it harder for programmers to accidentally leave buffers unterminated or allow them to be overflowed. They have been adopted by the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects but not by the GNU C Library. On OpenBSD, the linker has been changed to issue a warning when unsafe string manipulation functions, such as \`strcpy\`, \`strcat\`, or \`sprintf\`, are found. All occurrences of these functions in the OpenBSD source tree have been replaced. In addition, a static bounds checker is included in OpenBSD in an attempt to find other common programming mistakes at compile time. Other security-related APIs developed by the OpenBSD project include \`issetugid\` and \`arc4random\`.  Kernel randomization  In a June 2017 email, Theo de Raadt stated that a problem with stable systems was that they could be running for months at a time. Although there is considerable randomization within the kernel, some key addresses remains the same. The project in progress modifies the linker so that on every boot, the kernel is relinked, as well as all other randomizations. This differs from kernel ASLR; in the email he states that \\"As a result, every new kernel is unique. The relative offsets between functions and data are unique ... [The current] change is scaffolding to ensure you boot a newly-linked kernel upon every reboot ... so that a new random kernel can be linked together ... On a fast machine it takes less than a second ... A reboot runs the new kernel, and yet another kernel is built for the next boot. The internal deltas between functions inside the kernel are not where an attacker expects them to be, so he'll need better info leaks\\".email 2017-06-13  Memory protection  OpenBSD integrates several technologies to help protect the operating system from attacks such as buffer overflows or integer overflows. Developed by Hiroaki Etoh, ProPolice is a GCC extension designed to protect applications from stack-smashing attacks. It does this through a number of operations: local stack variables are reordered to place buffers after pointers, protecting them from corruption in case of a buffer overflow; pointers from function arguments are also placed before local buffers; and a canary value is placed after local buffers which, when the function exits, can sometimes be used to detect buffer overflows. ProPolice chooses whether or not to protect a buffer based on automatic heuristics which judge how vulnerable it is, reducing the performance overhead of the protection. It was integrated in OpenBSD's version GCC in December 2002, and first made available in OpenBSD 3.3; it was applied to the kernel in release 3.4. The extension works on all the CPU architectures supported by OpenBSD and is enabled by default, so any C code compiled will be protected without user intervention. In May 2004, OpenBSD on the SPARC platform received further stack protection in the form of StackGhost. This makes use of features of the SPARC architecture to help prevent exploitation of buffer overflows. Support for SPARC64 was added to in March 2005. OpenBSD 3.4 introduced W^X, a memory management scheme to ensure that memory is either writable or executable, but never both, which provides another layer of protection against buffer overflows. While this is relatively easy to implement on a platform like x86-64, which has hardware support for the NX bit, OpenBSD is one of the few OSes to support this on the generic i386 platform, which lacks built in per-page execute controls. During the development cycle of the 3.8 release, changes were made to the \`malloc\` memory management functions. In traditional Unix operating systems, \`malloc\` allocates more memory by extending the Unix data segment, a practice that has made it difficult to implement strong protection against security problems. The \`malloc\` implementation now in OpenBSD makes use of the \`mmap\` system call, which was modified so that it returns random memory addresses and ensures that different areas are not mapped next to each other. In addition, allocation of small blocks in shared areas are now randomized and the \`free\` function was changed to return memory to the kernel immediately rather than leaving it mapped into the process. A number of additional, optional checks were also added to aid in development. These features make program bugs easier to detect and harder to exploit: instead of memory being corrupted or an invalid access being ignored, they often result in a segmentation fault and abortion of the process. This has brought to light several issues with software running on OpenBSD 3.8, particularly with programs reading beyond the start or end of a buffer, a type of bug that would previously not be detected directly but can now cause an error. These abilities took more than three years to implement without considerable performance loss.  Cryptography and randomization  One of the goals of the OpenBSD project is the integration of facilities and software for strong cryptography into the core operating system. To this end, a number of low-level features are provided, including a source of strong pseudo random numbers; built-in cryptographic hash functions and transforms; and support for cryptographic hardware (OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework). These abilities are used throughout OpenBSD, including the bcrypt password-hashing algorithm derived from Bruce Schneier's Blowfish block cipher, which takes advantage of the CPU-intensive Blowfish key schedule, making brute-force attacks less practical. To protect sensitive information such as passwords from leaking on to disk, where they can persist for many years, OpenBSD supports encryption of the swap partition. The swap space is split up into many small regions that are each assigned their own encryption key: as soon as the data in a region is no longer required, OpenBSD securely deletes it by discarding the encryption key. This feature is enabled by default in OpenBSD 3.9 and later. The network stack also makes heavy use of randomization to increase security and reduce the predictability of various values that may be of use to an attacker, including TCP initial sequence numbers and timestamps, and ephemeral source ports. A number of features to increase network resilience and availability, including countermeasures for problems with ICMP and software for redundancy, such as CARP and pfsync, are also included. The project was the first to disable the plain-text telnet daemon in favor of the encrypted SSH daemon, in 1999, and features other integrated cryptographic software such as IPsec. The telnet daemon was completely removed from OpenBSD in 2005 before the release of OpenBSD version 3.8.  X11  All parts of X11 on OpenBSD are running as the user, except for the X server, which is split between a privilege-stripped X process run as root, and an X process run as the _X11 user. In X11 on OpenBSD, neither the X server nor X clients normally have any escalated direct memory or hardware privileges: When driving X with the Intel(4) or Radeon(4) drivers, these normally interact with the underlying hardware via the Direct Rendering Management(4) kernel interface only, so that lowlevel memory/hardware access is handled solely by the kernel. Other drivers such as WSFB follow a similar pattern. For this reason, X11 on OpenBSD does not open up lowlevel memory or hardware access to user/root programs as is done on some other systems, and as was done in the past, which then needed the user to escalate the machdep.allowaperture setting from its default zero setting, to an unsecure setting. OpenBSD's version of the X Window System (named Xenocara) has some security modifications. The server and some of the default applications are patched to make use of privilege separation, and OpenBSD provides an \\"aperture\\" driver to limit X's access to memory. However, after work on X security flaws by Loïc Duflot, Theo de Raadt commented that the aperture driver was merely \\"the best we can do\\" and that X \\"violates all the security models you will hear of in a university class.\\" He went on to castigate X developers for \\"taking their time at solving this > 10-year-old problem.\\" On November 29, 2006, a VESA kernel driver was developed that permitted X to run, albeit more slowly, without the use of the aperture driver. On February 15, 2014, X was further modified to allow it to run without root privileges. After the discovery of a security vulnerability in X, OpenBSD doesn't support the running of X as a root user and only supports running X via a display manager as a dedicated \`_x11\` user.  Other features  Privilege separation, privilege revocation, chrooting and randomized loading of libraries also play a role in increasing the security of the system. Many of these have been applied to the OpenBSD versions of common programs such as tcpdump and Apache, and to the BSD Authentication system. OpenBSD has a history of providing its users with full disclosure in relation to various bugs and security breaches detected by the OpenBSD team. This is exemplified by the project's slogan: \\"Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!\\" In OpenBSD 5.3, support for full disk encryption was introduced. OpenBSD 5.8 introduced the \`pledge\` system call for restricting process capabilities to a minimal subset required for correct operation. If the process is compromised and attempts to perform an unintended behavior, it will be terminated by the kernel. Since its introduction, applications and ports have been changed to support \`pledge\`, including the Chromium web browser.

According to one classification system they are said to be uniaxial (having one degree of freedom).Platzer, Werner (2008) Color Atlas of Human Anatomy', Volume 1, p.28 The direction which the distal bone takes in this motion is seldom in the same plane as that of the axis of the proximal bone; there is usually a certain amount of deviation from the straight line during flexion. The articular surfaces of the bones are connected by strong collateral ligaments. The best examples of ginglymoid joints are the Interphalangeal joints of the hand and those of the foot and the joint between the humerus and ulna. The knee joints and ankle joints are less typical, as they allow a slight degree of rotation or of side-to-side movement in certain positions of the limb. The knee is the largest hinge joint in the human body. Hinge and pivot joints are both types of synovial joint. A hinge joint can be considered a modified sellar/saddle joint, with reduced movement.

During his career, he has published 30 albums (not including unofficial releases) and has written over 250 songs, as well as lyrics for other artists. Rossi calls himself a provocautore (an Italian portmanteau for \\"provoking author\\") as throughout his career he has been regularly criticized over his choice of lifestyle and the lyrics in his songs. With more than 35 millions of copies sold, he is one of the best-selling Italian singers. His Modena Park 2017 concert is the current highest-attended ticketed concert of all time. Biography = Early life and education = Vasco Rossi was born in Zocca, in the province of Modena (Emilia-Romagna). His father, Carlo Rossi, was a truck-driver, and his mother, Novella, a housewife. It was his mother herself who decided to enroll him in singing school when he was a little boy, a choice that must have seemed rather peculiar within the mentality of a small village in the Apennines like Zocca. Nonetheless, Rossi fell in love with music and at the age of 14 began playing with his first band. Rossi and his family moved to Bologna, Italy, where he studied accounting in high school. Upon graduating he opened a music club, Punto Club, and enrolled in university at the faculty of Economics and Business. In the meantime he supported himself by working as a DJ and founding, along with friends, one of the first private radio stations in Italy, \\"Punto Radio\\", with which he began slowly and timidly showcasing his own songs. = Musical career = Encouraged by his friend Gaetano Curreri (now leading member of Italian rock band Stadio), Rossi released his first EP on 13 June 1977, which included the songs \\"\\" (Jenny is crazy) and \\"Silvia\\", and a full-length album in 1978, ' (\\"What do you think a song is\\"). In 1979, he released a second album, ' (\\"We're not at all the Americans\\"), which included, \\"\\" (\\"Cleardawn\\"), one of his biggest hits, a ballad considered emblematic of Rossi's poetic style. His most controversial album, Colpa d'Alfredo (\\"Alfredo's fault\\") followed in 1980; its title-track was censored from the radio and let loose bitter criticism because it contained some lyrics referring to women considered too explicit at that time. The controversy actually increased Rossi's popularity, and he quickly saw himself famous on a national level, particularly after performing live on Domenica In, a popular Italian television program. The performance did not particularly please journalist Nantas Salvalaggio, who published a scathing article against Rossi calling him a drug addict. Rossi argued that Salvalaggio evidently did not understand his music and remarked how easy it is to criticize a still unknown artist who cannot defend himself. In 1981, the album Siamo solo noi (\\"It's only us\\") was released. The title track, another signature song of his, would become commonly recognized as a generational hymn. In 1982, Rossi took part for the first time in the Sanremo Music Festival, performing the song \\"Vado al massimo\\" (\\"I'm taking it to the max\\"). Here, he once again found himself under harsh criticism, and came in last place in the festival. In April of the same year the album Vado al Massimo was released. The following year, he reappeared at the Sanremo Music Festival, this time performing \\"Vita spericolata\\" (Daredevil Life), probably his most popular song, and finishing in second-to- last place due to his apparent state of intoxication. The following album, Bollicine (\\"Little Bubbles\\"), published in 1983, was his sixth in seven years, and was the album that consecrated him definitively as an idol of the new generation and an icon of Italian rock. The title track, whose lyrics are about Coke (but also demonstrate a clear assonance with cocaine), won the Festivalbar '83, and his tour that year was an enormous success. To celebrate this positive period in his career, Rossi released his first live recording in 1984, Va bene, va bene così (\\"It's alright, it's alright this way\\"). In April, however, he was arrested on charges of drug possession. He was immediately granted provisional release from jail, but subsequently sentenced to 2 years and eight months of probation. Shortly thereafter he released his next album, Cosa succede in città (\\"What's going on in the city\\"), which became one of his weakest critically and did not reach past sales. In 1987 Vasco Rossi's ninth album, C'è chi dice no (\\"There Are Some Who Say No\\"), was released; the ever- increasing numbers of fans showing up to his concerts forced him to quit performing in clubs and normal-sized venues and begin the era of something for which he is known to this day—playing in and selling out big arenas and stadiums. His tenth studio album, Liberi liberi (\\"[we are] Free, Free\\"), followed in 1989. It reached 800,000 sales in Italy. The success of his 1989 tour brought the release of the live album Fronte del palco (a pun on the Italian title of Marlon Brando's film \\"Waterfront\\" which was \\"Fronte del porto\\", and thus meaning \\"Stage Front\\") and the organization of two concerts in 1990, one at the San Siro stadium in Milan and the other at the Flaminio in Rome. Live album has sold over 300,000 units in Italy. Rossi's next album, Gli spari sopra (\\"The shots above\\"), released in 1993, went ten times platinum. The title track, which was a major hit, is a cover version of Celebrate by the Irish band An Emotional Fish. In 1994, he gave the unreleased \\"Senza Parole\\" (\\"Without Words\\") as a gift to members of his official fan-club. In 1995, Rossi was again the star at San Siro with a double concert, Rock sotto l'assedio (\\"Rock under siege\\"), which protested the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rossi invited a few Bosnian bands like Sikter, Lezi Majmune, and Protest to perform but was heavily criticized by the press because the proceeds weren't given to charity, despite the fact they were never meant to be. Vasco Rossi in 2007 In 1996, Rossi recorded a new studio album, Nessun Pericolo... Per Te (\\"No Danger... For You\\"), featuring the songs \\"Sally\\" and \\"Gli angeli\\" (\\"The Angels\\"), (the video of the latter was directed by Roman Polanski). The drum of the song \\"Anche se\\" (\\"Even If\\") later called \\"Praticamente perfetto\\" (\\"Practically Perfect\\") was recorded by Taylor Hawkins. The song was later included in the album Nessun Pericolo... Per Te (\\"No Danger... For You\\") in 1996. In 1998, Rossi rediscovered his singer- songwriter side, recording and releasing the album Canzoni per me (\\"Songs for me\\") with a softer and less \\"rock\\" sound, even remaking never-published songs written at the beginning of his career. The nature of the songs, however, did not impede Rossi from winning his second Festivalbar with the song, \\"L'una per te\\"; the name of this song, and the whole lyrics, is a word pun between the words \\"Luna\\" (\\"Moon\\") and \\"L'una\\" (\\"The one\\"). Given the low propensity of these songs to fit in his live show with the songs his fans had up to that time become accustomed to, he decided to hold just one concert in 1998, accepting the offer to be a guest star on the first evening of the new Heineken Jammin' Festival in Imola, Italy. The evening is immortalized in both video and in the 1999 live album Rewind. A few days into the tour, Rossi's inseparable friend, as well as guitarist and writer/cowriter of many songs and lyrics, Massimo Riva, died unexpectedly. He would be remembered and celebrated by Rossi and fans in nearly every concert that followed. In 2001, Stupido Hotel (\\"Stupid Hotel\\"), was released, and Rossi won his third Festivalbar, this time with the song \\"Siamo Soli\\" (\\"We are alone\\"). In 2002 Rossi released his first official recording of remastered songs in their original version, Tracks, which was followed by three sold-out performances at San Siro Stadium in Milan. His album Buoni o cattivi (\\"Good or Bad Ones\\") was the most successful album in Italy in 2004. On 12 May 2005, Milan's IULM conferred an honorary degree in Communication Sciences to Vasco Rossi. On 9 September 2005, Rossi released the double DVD È solo un Rock'n'Roll show (\\"It's Only a Rock'n’Roll Show\\") with Andrea Lehotská, launching the concept of the 'movieclip,' in which all the songs from Buoni o cattivi (Good or Bad [guys])' are used in a 2-hour music video. Three months later, Buoni o cattivi live anthology 04.05 was released, a comprehensive box set comprising a double CD and a triple DVD, recorded live from the record-setting Buoni o cattivi tour of 2004 and 2005. In December 2005 he returned to his home town of Zocca, where his childhood friends and the rest of the community organized a tribute in his honor, including a photo display and other celebrations. In 2007, he released the \\"Vasco Extended Play\\", that contains the hit single \\"Basta Poco\\" (\\"A Little Is Enough\\"). The EP topped the Italian FIMI Charts for 21 Weeks, making that the Italian best-selling single of 2007. On 4 May 2010, the newspaper Corriere della Sera reported Vasco Rossi as saying the American and British governments had been responsible for preventing him and other Italian musicians from becoming known in those countries. \\"Just as Bob Dylan was banned from playing in China, for 20 years I was barred from London. ... It's one of the many 'presents' that America left us after World War II. To favour the sale of American and British music to Italy and discourage the export of our talents abroad.\\"Corrieredellasera.it Intervista On 4 November he released a new album, Sono innocente (I'm innocent). The disc was preceded by the single \\"Come vorrei\\" (How I would like to). During the recording session for the new album, Vasco wrote the lyrics to a song musically written by Dave Grohl, entitled \\"Sognare ancora\\" (Dreaming Again). This particular song was included in a compilation for Dave Grohl's music project. = Retirement from touring = In June 2011 Rossi announced he would be retiring from touring and live work although would continue to work in the music business. End of the road for rockstar Vasco Italy for Beginners, 27 June 2011 In January 2013 Rossi withdrew his resignation and announced a new tour in Turin and Bologna, followed by tours: Vasco Live Kom '014, Vasco Live Kom '015, Vasco Live Kom '016, and the huge concert to celebrate his 40 years of career, on 1 July 2017, held in Modena and called Modena Park. The Modena Park 2017 is currently the largest concert with over 225,000 tickets sold, breaking other world records.  Personal life  During 2011, Vasco's lawyers threatened to undertake legal action against popular Italian satire website Nonciclopedia, the Italian version of Uncyclopedia, arguing that the rock star was offended by the content of the page. On 3 October 2011 the website shut down after repeated inquiries from the police to the site's admins. The news promptly spread across the web via thousands of tweets, blogposts and to some Italian newspapers. Rossi is an atheist.

However, the terms are distinct in that age comes from the verb ageru, meaning upward, and implying direction and/or motion. In the martial arts, the noun jōdan refers specifically to a target area of the body, including the shoulders and above.

Other islands were subsequently declared to form part of the Protectorate. Establishment and addition of islands The Protectorate was first declared over the southern Solomons in 1893. The formalities in its establishment were carried out by officers of the Royal Navy, who hoisted the British flag and read Proclamations on twenty-one islands. In April 1896, Charles Morris Woodford, was appointed as an Acting Deputy Commissioner of the British Western Pacific Territories. From 30 May to 10 August 1896, HMS Pylades toured through the Solomon Islands archipelago with Woodford, who had been sent to survey the islands, and to report on the economic feasibility of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. On 29 September 1896, in anticipation of the establishment of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, Woodford purchased the island of Tulagi, which he has selected as the site for the administrative centre. The Colonial Office appointed Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the labour trade operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Arthur William Mahaffy was appointed at the Deputy Commissioner in January 1889. He was based in Gizo, his duties included suppressing head hunting in New Georgia and neighbouring islands. Bellona and Rennell Islands and the Stewart Islands were added to the Protectorate in 1897, and the Santa Cruz group, the Reef Islands, Anuda (Cherry), Fataka (Mitre) and Trevannion Islands and Duff (Wilson) group in 1898. On 18 August 1898 and 1 October 1898, the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific issued Proclamations which declared (apparently superfluously) that all those islands should \\"henceforth\\" form part of the Protectorate. The two Proclamations of 1898 were superseded by one dated 28 January 1899, which was apparently intended not to consolidate them but also to correct geographical errors: it lists \\"the Reef Islands, Swallow Group\\" and a different group of islands referred to collectively as \\"the Swallow Group,\\" and it includes Trevannion in the Santa Cruz group. By a Convention signed in 1899 and ratified in 1900, Germany renounced her rights in the islands to the east and south-east of Bougainville, and in October 1900, the High Commissioner issued a Proclamation extending the Protectorate to the islands in question, i.e. Choiseul, Ysabel, Shortland and Fauro Islands (each with its dependencies), the Tasman group, Lord Howe's group and Gower Island. Its establishment followed missionary activity which began in the mid 19th century and the establishment of a German Protectorate over the Northern Solomons, following an Anglo-German Treaty of 1886. German interests were transferred to the United Kingdom under the Samoa Tripartite Convention of 1899, in exchange for recognition of the German claim to Western Samoa. Suppression of head-hunting and punitive actions Until about 1902 there continued to be headhunting raids against Solomon Islanders, and there were also instances of European traders and plantation owners being killed. The response of the colonial officials was to engage in punitive raids against the villages that were either known to have been involved in the violence, or were suspect to have been involved. Ships of the Royal Navy would also engage in punitive actions. In March 1897, the sailors of HMS Rapid exacted revenge for the deaths of traders at Rendova, New Georgia, Nggatokae and Vella Lavella. In September 1891 the British naval warship HMS Royalist punished a village of the Kalikoqu tribe of the Roviana Lagoon, on southern side of New Georgia Island in the Solomon Islands archipelago, following the murder of a trader; the sailors shot some of the men who were believed to be the leaders, set fire to the village and destroyed canoes. Shipping in the Solomon Islands Woodford initially used a 27-foot open whaleboat to travel between the islands, or travelled on any available trading boat or Royal Navy ship. From 1896 the Burns Philp steamship the Titus was making between four and seven voyages from Sydney to the Solomon Islands. Two ships owned by Gustavus John Waterhouse of Sydney operated in the Solomon Islands; the schooner Chittoor, and SS Kurrara, a steam ship. The schooner Lark owned by J. Hawkins, from Sydney, also sailed in the waters of the Solomon Islands. In 1899, Woodford purchased the Lahloo, a 33-ton ketch, which he used for suppressing head- hunting in the New Georgia group. The Lahloo was wrecked in 1909. The Belama, a 100-ton steam ship, was acquired in 1909. However, it was wreaked in February 1911 when it struck an uncharted reef off Isabel. The replacement ship, also named Belama, (previously the river steamer Awittaka) arrived at Tulagi in August 1911. It was wrecked off Isabel in 1921. Plantation economy Aerial view of the Solomon Islands The policy of the colonial officials was to attempt to make the protectorate self-supporting through taxes imposed on copra and other products exported from the Islands. The long- term interests of the islanders was relegated to a secondary priority as the colonial officials focused on encouraging the Investment by Australian and English corporate trading companies and individual plantation owners. By 1902 there were about 83 Europeans in the Solomon Islands, with most engaged in the development of copra plantations. The Solomon (Waste Land) Regulation of 1900 (Queen's Regulation no 3 of 1900), and later revisions, was intended by the British Solomon Islands administration in Tulagi, the Western Pacific High Commission in Suva, and the Colonial Office in London to make land available for commercial plantations by a formal process of identifying ‘waste’ land – that is land not occupied by Solomon Islanders – which could be declared “not owned, cultivated, or occupied by any native or non-native person”. The Regulation of 1900 implemented a concept of ‘waste’ land that was not consistent with Melanesian customs, as unoccupied land was still recognised by customary law as being the property of individual people and communities. From 1900 to 1902, an attempt was made by the Pacific Islands Company Ltd to establish plantations. However, it was unable to raise sufficient capital to establish plantations because the Regulation of 1900 only permitted the issue of ‘Certificates of Occupation’ of the land and not a formal lease. This limited right to occupy the land were not accepted by financiers as sufficient collateral to finance development of plantations. Lever's Pacific Plantations Ltd, a subsidiary of Lever Brothers, became the largest operator of plantations, with 26 plantations established by 1916. The Malayta Company operated 7 plantations, and was controlled by the Young family who were associated with the South Seas Evangelical Church. Burns, Philp & Co operated 7 plantations through subsidiaries - the Solomon Islands Development Company, the Shortland Islands Plantation Ltd and Choiseul Plantations Ltd. These corporate plantation owners employed 55 per cent of the Solomon Islanders engaged in the copra industry, with individual plantation owners employing the remaining 45 percent. World War II B-17 bombers over Gizo in October 1942 The Solomon Islands with the New Georgias highlighted =Japanese invasion of the Solomon Islands= In 1940 Donald Gilbert Kennedy joined the administration of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. Following the attack of the Japanese on Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941, Kennedy organised an intelligence-gathering network of local informants and messengers to carry out the role of Coastwatchers to monitor Japanese activity. The Coastwatchers were planters, government officials, missionaries and islanders monitoring who went into hiding after the Japanese invasion of the Solomon Islands in January 1942. The Coastwatchers monitored Japanese shipping and aircraft (reporting by radio) and also rescued Allied personnel who were stranded in the territory held by the Japanese. The counter-attack was led by the United States; the 1st Division of the US Marine Corps landed on Guadalcanal and Tulagi in August 1942. Some of the bitterest fighting of World War II took place on the islands for almost three years. Tulagi, the seat of the British administration on the island of Nggela Sule in Central Province was destroyed in the heavy fighting following landings by the US Marines. Then the tough battle for Guadalcanal, which was centered on the capture of the airfield, Henderson Field, led to the development of the adjacent town of Honiara as the United States logistics center. =Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana= Islanders Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana were Allied scouts during the war. They became famous when they were noted by National Geographic for being the first men to find the shipwrecked John F. Kennedy and his crew of the PT-109 using a traditional dugout canoe. They suggested the idea of using a coconut to write a rescue message for delivery. The coconut was later kept on Kennedy's desk. Their names had not been credited in most movie and historical accounts, and they were turned back before they could visit President Kennedy's inauguration, though the Australian coastwatcher would also meet the president. They were visited by a member of the Kennedy family in 2002, where they still lived in traditional huts without electricity. =War consequences= The impact of the war on islanders was profound. The destruction caused by the fighting and the longer- term consequences of the introduction of modern materials, machinery and western cultural artifacts, transformed traditional isolated island ways of life. The reconstruction was slow in the absence of war reparations and with the destruction of the pre-war plantations, formerly the mainstay of the economy. Significantly, the Solomon Islanders' experience as labourers with the Allies led some to a new appreciation of the importance of economic organisation and trade as the basis for material advancement. Some of these ideas were put into practice in the early post-war political movement \\"Maasina Ruru\\"—often redacted to \\"Marching Rule\\". Towards independence =Legislative Council and Executive Council= Stability was restored during the 1950s, as the British colonial administration built a network of official local councils. On this platform Solomon Islanders with experience on the local councils started participation in central government, initially through the bureaucracy and then, from 1960, through the newly established Legislative and Executive Councils. The Protectorate did not possess a constitution of its own until 1960. Positions on both Councils were initially appointed by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific,Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 897(as to title, being High Commissioner for the Western Pacific) but progressively more of the positions were directly elected or appointed by electoral colleges formed by the local councils. =Proposed transfer to Australia= In the 1950s, British and Australian government officials contemplated transferring sovereignty of the Solomon Islands from the United Kingdom to Australia. The Solomon Islands had close ties to Australia; it used the Australian pound, relied on Australian air and shipping services, employed many Australians as civil servants, and its businesses were dependent upon Australian capital. Some Australian officials argued that the British had shown little interest in the development of the islands, while British officials believed Australia did not have sufficient trained staff to take over the administration. Unlike Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and the New Hebrides, Australia made no formal request for a transfer of sovereignty. However, there were informal discussions between officials in the Colonial Office and the Australian Department of Territories. In 1956, Territories Minister Paul Hasluck proposed to cabinet that Australia take over the Solomons, with the support of External Affairs Minister Richard Casey. It was proposed that Australia would effectively double the annual development funds that the UK had allocated to the Solomons, from £1,073,533 to about £2 million. However, the Treasury Department was unenthused about the additional expenditure, and the Defence Department stated there was \\"no defence advantage in assuming responsibility\\" with the islands in British hands. Cabinet rejected the proposal. =First national election= The first national election was held in 1964 for the seat of Honiara, and by 1967 the first general election was held for all but one of the 15 representative seats on the Legislative Council (the one exception was the Eastern Outer Islands constituency, which was again appointed by electoral college). Elections were held again in 1970 and a new constitution was introduced. The 1970 constitution replaced the Legislative and Executive Councils with a single Governing Council. It also established a 'committee system of government' where all members of the Council sat on one or more of five committees. The aims of this system were to reduce divisions between elected representatives and the colonial bureaucracy and to provide opportunities for training new representatives in managing the responsibilities of government. It was also claimed that this system was more consistent with the Melanesian style of government, however, this was quickly undermined by opposition to the 1970 constitution and the committee system by elected members of the council. As a result, a new constitution was introduced in 1974 which established a standard Westminster form of government and gave the Islanders both Chief Ministerial and Cabinet responsibilities. Solomon Mamaloni became the country's first Chief Minister in July 1974 and the Governing Council was transformed into the Legislative Assembly. The protectorate that existed over Solomon Islands was ended under the terms of the Solomon Islands Act 1978 which annexed the territories comprising the protectorate as part of Her Majesty’s dominions.

It is roughly translated as \\"From outside block\\", similar to Osotogari (leg throw from the outside), which comes from the block's final resting point centered on the blocker's body. The opposite of soto uke is uchi uke (\\"From inside block\\"). Soto uke is performed by bringing one hand to the ear, keeping the elbow raised, and sweeping the arm down and out towards the center of the body. The preparatory step of raising the arm gives the block more momentum, making it somewhat painful to encounter. A different application involves extending the non-blocking hand in front before performing the block. This represents grabbing the attacker's arm. The motion termed the block, then, is actually meant to break the arm, which would explain the necessity of the extra momentum. The above designations are particular to Shotokan and some other schools, and are backwards from other systems (Wado-ryu, Doshinkan, Uechi-Ryu, etc.) where soto uke is a block to the outside and uchi uke is a block to the inside — consistent with Gedan Barai is a block in the downward direction and Jodan Age Uke is a block in the upwards direction.

The event offers a purse of $250,000. History The race is named in honor of Peter Brant's filly, Just A Game, who was voted 1980 American Champion Female Turf Horse honors. The event was inaugurated on Independence Day in 1992 and run over a distance of miles on a muddy dirt track, won by Lady Lear who defeated the Irish Bred favorite by a length in a time of 2:15. The event was not held in 1993 but the next year the event was moved to the turf and run over a mile. The event was classified as a Grade III in 1997, upgraded to Grade II in 2004 and a Grade I in 2008. The event carried Breeders' Cup incentives between 1996 and 2005 which were reflected in the name of the event. Several mares have won this event who later became champions. The 2000 winner Perfect Sting later that year won the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf and was crowned US Champion Female Turf Horse. The 2004 British bred winner Intercontinental returned the following year only to get defeated into second place by Sand Springs but by the end of the season she made amends by winning Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf and also becoming the 2005 US Champion Female Turf Horse. The 2015 winner Tepin continued en route to a Breeders' Cup Mile win and honored as 2015 US Champion Female Turf Horse.

The series is mix of serious combat, political intrigue, light romance, and comedy, a classic story of the underdogs trying prove their worth amidst superior enemies, and doubtful arrogant allies. The series was produced with mix of traditional and computer generated animation. This was an anime produced with cooperation from the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) during a period that there was no collaboration between anime producers and fandoms of similar types of anime. The original article lists \\"Sugiyama Kiyoshi\\", who has conducted \\"extensive research about JSDF as an anime producer\\" and is considered an industry expert when it comes to \\"collaboration between anime and JSDF,\\" as the producer, but in fact the producer was Atsushi Yukawa. Kiyoshi was the producer of Girls und Panzer, but there is no evidence he was a producer for Sutoratosu Fō [Stratos 4] or Takutikaru Roa [Tactical Roar]. Yukawa, on the other hand, was a Chief Producer of a Girls und Panzer movie and OAV. It was one of the main collaborative efforts between anime producers and the JSDF. The show was broadcast on TV Kanagawa, Chiba TV, TV Saitama, TV Aichi, Sun TV and KBS Kyoto. Reportedly, the Pascal Magi was based on the Murasame-class destroyer, and the ship in the show was given a designation with the consent of the JSDF, which the producers worked with to create realistic battle scenes and models for the anime. The theme song, ending theme, and background music for the show were created by Lantis Co., Ltd. Premise In the near future, a hypercane has appeared in the Pacific Ocean, causing a series of worldwide climate changes. This storm, dubbed the \\"Grand Roar,\\" has been stable for over 50 years. Climate changes make air travel and transport less reliable, and thus the world has begun reverting to a second naval age, particularly in the Asian region. However, the world's condition also heralds the return of piracy and the growth of maritime terrorism, causing many large international companies to arm themselves and setting up their own private naval security forces. At the outset of the series, Systems Engineer Hyōsuke Nagimiya runs into the crew of the Pascal Magi, one such maritime security ship. He gets into a few typical compromising situations before finally being introduced as a software engineer assigned to update the systems on board the ship. He meets his stepsister, the captain of the war vessel, Captain Nanaha Misaki, who treats him as a stranger. Although he refers to her as 'sister,' he still thinks of her as a woman nonetheless. During the duration of his duties, the ship is called into combat, where Hyosuke begins to understand the nature of the Pascal Magi and its crew's battle potential as the vessel flings itself into the fight. Cast =Main protagonists= *Hyōusuke Nagimiya (voiced by Hisayoshi Suganuma) was brought onto the Pascal Magi to upgrade the ship's computers. At first like many others he believed that his sister's ship wouldn't be able to do much against pirates and was surprised that it had a completely female crew. However, after seeing their skill and the ship's prowess in battle, he began to have respect and admiration for them. He calls the captain Nana-nee since they grew up together but sees her as a woman instead of a step-sister. He still keeps with him the compass Misaki gave him when they were children. In an interview with the show's cast, Suganama said she saw Hyousuke and Nanaha more as friends than lovers. *Nanaha \\"Nanami\\" Misaki (voiced by Mai Nakahara) is the captain of the ship and has a cold and professional attitude and cares very much for her crew. Even though she can be quite serious most of the time, when her crew mates are put in danger or do something dangerous for her she turns into a crybaby. Nanaha can also be quite childish, she uses a character OS for her desktop and started whacking Tanya when she found out. She sees Hyousuke as a little brother as they are step siblings but then later questions herself if she actually likes him. Whenever she is alone with Hyousuke, she drops her serious attitude and refers to him with more familiarity. A lot of things happened to her in the military and she regrets not having the time to contact Hyousuke. In the same interview with the show's cast, Nakahara said she tried to exude the impression of being the \\"perfect\\" captain and the \\"perfect\\" girl. *Tsubasa Watatsumi (voiced by Mikako Takahashi) is a pilot on the ship and seems to hate men. However this seems to just be a facade she puts so she can appear stronger in front of them. After a short while she seems to like Hyousuke and later confesses. In a cast interview, Takahashi said that Tsubasa liked Hyousuke because he is messy, with the bonds between them deepening through the various battles. *Sango Fukami (voiced by Kana Ueda) is a crewman on the ship and has a very wild imagination. She works in and is the head of the engine room and has close friends on the ship. In an interview with the cast, Ueda said that her character was \\"able to overcome the death of my best friend\\" and grow from that. *Miharu Kairi (voiced by Yumiko Kobayashi) is a very smart young girl who developed the battle system Nav-Staff OS for the ship. It is apparent she has a genius intellect after she mentioned in a conversation with Hyousuke that she developed her first program when she was three and is easily able to do things Hyousuke cannot after programming for years. She seems to have developed a crush on Hyousuke since the first time she sees him. In a cast interview, Kobayashi said that she had a lot of fun playing Miharu and found it rewarding, noting the childlike qualities Miharu had. *Manatsu Akoya (voiced by Kumiko Higa) is a twin sister to Mashu and a gunner on the ship. She has blond pigtails and like her sister she likes playing tricks on people and combat. She runs communications. In an interview with the show's cast, Higa stated that she the importance of Manatsu and Mashu as twins. *Mashū Akoya (voiced by Satomi Arai) is a twin sister to Manatsu and also a gunner on the ship. She and her sister both like combat and also like to play tricks on others. She lets her hair down and is longer. She runs observations. In a cast interview, Arai said that Mashu and Mantsu are friends who have something in common, using the same cosmetics, and so much more. *Mitori Shimabara (voiced by Junko Minagawa) is the ship's physician and is very kind and friendly to everyone and is a constant flirt, especially to Hyousuke even though she is married, as shown in the episodes \\"Scenery With K\\" and \\"Sunset Festival,\\" which is why some have stated that she is bisexual. When she is drunk she likes to play with the captain. *Tanya L. Kojima (voiced by Kaya Miyake) is the Vice-Captain of the ship and very loyal to the Captain who is more of a friend than a boss. They even went to the Naval Academy together. Whenever she is drunk she becomes possessive of the captain and will get into fights with Mitori over her. In an interview with the show's cast, Miyake, she said that while Tanya doesn't have anything to do with romance, \\"everyone is longing for\\" for Hyousake, with Tanya different than any of the other characters. *Clio Aquanaut (voiced by Rio Natsuki) is the bisexual \\"player\\" of the crew, with many girls after her, meaning she lives to seek sexual variety, rather than having a long-term romantic relationship. She likes to tease and flirt with Hyousuke as well as anyone else and is the Weapons Chief. In a cast interview, Natsuki said that there aren't as many nurses in animated shows, saying that she isn't \\"a chill woman\\" but is rather taking \\"good care of the crew's heart.\\" In another interview, she says that Clio \\"seems to like both men and women.\\" =Supporting characters= *Lemala Hamaguchi (voiced by Daiki Nakamura) is the ships overseer from the company Haru-Nico that owns the ship and is very judgmental of the crew and its captain. *Kunio Okamachi (voiced by Kenji Nomura) is the manager of the Haru- Nico Security Company for which the Pascal Magi is part of, supporting the ship, admired as a boss, and formerly part of the army. *Remara Hamaguchi (voiced by Hamaguchi Remara) is the insurance department supervisor of Haru- Nico, and is often self-centered, although also timid and opportunistic. *Wujifushi Keigoro (voiced by Shinpachi Tsuji) is captain of a ship affiliated with the Pascal Mahi, the Coleman, claiming that \\"a woman is not needed on the destroyer\\" and is respected by the Himico leadership. *Jardimmar Esterella (voiced by Mai Kadowaki) is Vice-President of the East Ruth Republic, although also a 14-year-old girl, and has well-educated parents, while preferring old ships like the Pascal Magi, and since she greets everyone who enters her kingdom with a kiss, including women, this makes Nanaha uncomfortable *Furūdo (Fluid) (voiced by Rina Sato) is a female terrorist who had traveled through numerous organizations and is acting with a certain belief, although she claims to be \\"free.\\" *Furōto (Float)(voiced by Akino Watanabe) is a twin sister of Furūdo, wearing gorgeous gothic lolita fashion and is accompanied by an 8mm film camera. She is also a so-called \\"free\\" terrorist. *Hassan (voiced by Shoto Kashii) is a man who was \\"hunting for an escort ship,\\" claiming to be a captain, actually a pirate. *Beyond Rush (voiced by Keisuke Fujita) is an active university student and was fascinated by Enoki, trying to outsmart the Pascal Magi. =Other characters= *Jornada (voiced by Ryuka Yuki) is one of the secetaries of Esterella, having a cool and calm personality, even giving strong opinions to Estellara. *Vent is a giant that serves as a guardian of the East Ruth Republic, accompanying Esterella and Jornada. *President Mariscos is the president of the East Ruth Republic and is only mentioned by name, with his brute force leading to revolt, and an armed resistance movement against the government. *Rydir's representative (voiced by Hidetoshi Nakamura) is the president of the conglomerate of large conglomerates and after the Grand Roar, he succeeds in rapidly fostering enterprises centered on the munitions industry and formed the world's best corporate alliance. *Toutetsu (voiced by Yoshino Ohashi) is a former professor of political science at Rush's staff *Regen (voiced by Junko Minagawa) is a developer of a hacking program \\"Provencal\\" and is relatively intelligent. *Hakubi (voiced by Mamiko Noto) is secretary and advisor of Ridil's representative and a drafter of a nine-proposition thesis which supports the activities of Ridil who is striving to realize it. *Ranburufisshu (voiced by Keichi Sonobe) is an elder of the “Olfat” tribe living in Taaloa Island, a resort area. *Mysterious girl who appears in almost all stories, with long black hair with golden eyes, a black dress and a light pink shawl, and a flower that looks like a hibiscus on her head. *Seiko Totti has red short hair and a yellow dress, serving as a person does work for villains. *Kasato Satoshi (voiced by Eri Nakao) is a first lieutenant, radar member, a sister of three daughters, and is well trusted by Nanaha. *Suzune Nijiura (voiced by Akari Higuchi) is a first-class lieutenant and helmsman, who looks like a child among the three daughters. *Mizumo Ayuhara (voiced by Fuoka Oura) is a first-class lieutenant and speed transmission member. *Asarigi Yui (voiced by Ryoko Ono) is a second lieutenant, part of the artillery department, and is one of the subordinates that Clio trusts. *Aina Emi (voiced by Akari Higuchi) is part of the CIC crew, a third-class captain, and part of the artillery department. *Kamegaki Mamiko, part of the CIC crew, a third-class lieutenant, and part of the communication department. *Colon Amata (voiced by Eri Nakao) is part of the CIC crew, a second lieutenant, and she is part of the communication department. *Mayor Lucca, is part of the CIC crew, a third captain, and she is part of the observation department. *Saika Lee (voiced by Junko Minagawa) is part of the CIC crew, a second lieutenant, and he is part of the observation department. *Isomura Hayase (voiced by Fuoka Oura) is part of the engine room crew, a first-class lieutenant, engine department, and is an emergency chief. *Tateyama Honami (voiced by Ryoko Ono) is part of the engine room crew, a first-class lieutenant, engine department, and a chief engineer. *Sasahara Sakura (voiced by Ami Hikayama) is a third-class lieutenant, part of equipment department, while being cheerful and straightforward. *Carson Kumiko J.

Episodes  Technology, locations, and terminology  There are many weapons shown in the show apart from the Pascal Magi. For instance, the Haru-Nico has frigates designed for commercial escort like the Rajdae class destroyer, Oliver, and Coleman. For the Western Army, there is a flagship, a support fleet flagship, and a destroyer. For the escort hunters, they have large ship which hunts escort ships, a stealth system, a missile boat, a supersonic missile named alfal, a camouflaged container carrier, and a Wecken attack helicopter. Additionally, there is the Wacken system which controls attack helicopters, an attack submarine called the Methusela, an electronic jamming device called an ECM buoy, anti-air mines, and a work research vessel that has the functions of sunken ship and floating dock called Friedkin, and many more. The show has a number of different locations. There are various pages for the show, for the letter a, letter k, letter s, letter t, letter n, letter h, letter m, letter y, and letter r. One of the key one is Namba Island, a huge man-made island in the Western Pacific Ocean, as it is a small natural island in the center, with a donut-shaped artificial island surrounding it. Additionally, a large train operates on the artificial island, is connected to an airfield with a 4000m-class runway that floats far west of the island. The city is roughly composed of a resort area in the north, a residential area in the northeast, a commercial area in the southeast, an industrial area and a harbor in the south, and a Western Guard base in the southwest. In addition, a hydrogen plant group floats in a semicircular shape concentric with the artificial island on the eastern offshore. The haru-nico security guarantee Nanbajima branch office and the company's wharf are located at a corner of the port on the south side of the island, and the company's ships, including Pascal Mage, are moored. The show's other locations were also affected by the Grand Roar, a huge cyclone that suddenly appeared in the Western Pacific 50 years before the story premiered, the catastrophe caused when the cyclone occurred, and a spiral cloud that extends from the cyclone called the Spiral Band. These locations included the Column Ally, an infamous strait, with general shipping routes compressed due to the influence of the Grand Roar, the small country of East Luz in the Southwest Pacific, which suffers from corruption, poverty, and other issues, the plant nation known as the Republic of Nachroma which started when the refugees who had been generated in large numbers after the Grand Roar and who were discharged from economically vulnerable states living on floating regions. Finally, there is the Sea Realm Movement, a megafloat (artificial island) constructed on the sea should be recognized as a territory, and a movement to claim territorial waters and an exclusive economic zone based on it. There are a number of terms used in the show. On the Pascal Magi, enemy ships of unknown affiliation which engaged in piracy were defined as \\"illegal,\\" while condition zebra meant that all ships are now in full control of their combat regime, damage control refers to a department that provides first-aid measures when a ship is damaged by battle. There were also terms to refer to each side of the helm, specific call signs like \\"Current Alpha\\" and \\"Drop One\\" which both are used by the Pascal Magi. Additionally, the crew used the phrase \\"Aye, Shorty!\\" which is a synonym for \\"Aye, Sir!\\" (used on the Coleman), meaning that something will be immediately executed. Although the female form should be \\"Aye, ma'am!\\", shorty refer to a slang term for attractive women, girlfriends and girls. Also, the phrase \\"Aye, Fellow!\\" is uttered by a crew member understands when a crew member reports or makes a statement with \\"fellow\\" referring to \\"colleagues.\\" Finally, Nanaha uses the term \\"Right over\\" meaning that she understands the matter, and it seems to be a response word used by the highest commander on the spot. Related products On the DVD for the show were seven short episodes, which were not depicted in the main story, directed by Yoshitaka Fujimoto, and storyboarded by Takeshi Ito. These accompanied each episode, along with images noting JSDF coverage, specific images, mechanical drawings of characters, and settings. Two singles of music from the song were introduced, as was the \\"Tactical Roar\\" Original Soundtrack. There were also models of the Pascal Magi (manufactured by Pit Road), and two other models of ships from the show. Also on October 6, 2006, Hobby Japan published the Complete Tactical Roar book, the characters were reportedly featured in a comic and an event was held relating to the show in some manner. Mai Nakahara, who plays Nanami, and Kana Ueda, who plays Sango, humorously talked on a radio show as their characters. A few years later, in a post announcing a DVD of these records said that Nakahara and Ueda's \\"logbooks,\\" which aired from November 4, 2005 to June 30, 2006, before the show began airing, were \\"extremely popular.\\" Reception Reception to the show has been generally positive. Some pointed out that this \\"futuristic science-fiction anime\\" has comedic moments apart from the \\"military drama, action, and adventure,\\" with nudity present but \\"nothing sexual about it,\\" while claiming Nanaha is openly lesbian, pointing out the \\"strong plot,\\" 3D visuals, and drama. The same reviewer said that the anime run of 13 episodes is \\"normal for many Japanese anime titles,\\" praising the show's premise, the focus on weather and climate change, focus on science, and the comedic elements. Another reviewer pointed out that Nanaha has been kissed by two characters, her stepbrother, Hyousuke, and Estrela, a vice-president, noting the show's yuri themes and its fan service. Others said that the anime resembled the Girls und Panzer anime due to its realistic military portrayal and \\"beautiful girl[s]\\" when reviewing an event with the show's staff.

Biography Ahrens was born on May 23 , 1919 in Dayton, Kentucky. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on February 3, 1942 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and underwent boot camp training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. He transferred to the Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia on March 16, 1942. Assigned to Company \\"A\\", 1st Raider Battalion, Fleet Marine Force, soon thereafter, Ahrens landed with that unit from at Tulagi, Guadalcanal, British Solomon Islands, in the second assault wave on August 7, 1942. With Company \\"C\\", 1st Raider Battalion, securing the right flank on the beachhead, Company \\"A\\" moved inland and down the right slope of Tulagi's central ridge. Initially, the Marines were not opposed. That evening, Company \\"A\\" took positions for the night west of a cricket ground on the island, as part of the defensive line extending along the ridge. The Japanese later launched a fierce nocturnal counterattack which drove a wedge between the two Raider companies. Isolating the latter near the beachhead, the enemy concentrated their efforts on Company \\"A\\" in an attempt to sweep up the ridge toward the residency, a former British government building serving as a Raider battalion command post. The Raiders, however, stood firm. During the savage battle that ensued, Ahrens, in a security detachment assigned the task of protecting the Raiders' right flank, singlehandedly engaged a group of Japanese in hand-to-hand combat as they attempted to infiltrate the Raiders' rear. He was found the next morning, mortally wounded, with 13 dead Japanese soldiers around his position.Hoffman, Marine Raiders, Zimmerman, The Guadalcanal Campaign, p. 33, Frank, Guadalcanal, p. 77–78, Jersey, Hell's Islands, p. 140. In his Navy Cross citation, he was credited with killing at least three Japanese, including the attacking unit's senior officer, and aiding materially in stopping their infiltration. His last words, to his commanding officer, were reported to be \\"The bastards tried to come over me last night-I guess they didn't know I was a Marine.\\" Private First Class Edward H Ahrens, twenty-two, unmarried, from Dayton, Kentucky, died in Silent Lew's arms. Awards and decorations For his part in stopping the enemy, was posthumously awarded a Navy Cross. =Citation= \\"The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Navy Cross (Posthumously) to Edward Henry Ahrens (358161), Private First Class, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty while serving with Company A, FIRST Marine Raider Battalion, during the landing assault and seizure of enemy Japanese-held Tulagi Island, British Solomon Islands, on the night of 7–8 August 1942. While a member of a security detachment protecting the right flank of his battalion, Private First Class Ahrens, with utter disregard for his own personal safety, single-handed engaged in hand-to-hand combat a group of the enemy attempting to infiltrate the rear of the battalion. Although mortally wounded, he succeeded in killing the officer in command of the hostile unit and two other Japanese, thereby breaking up the attack. His great personal valor and indomitable fighting spirit were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the defense of his country.\\" Namesake In 1943, the destroyer escort was named in his honor.

Fauntleroy, and produced by Steven Seagal, who also starred in the lead role. The film also co-stars Treach, Sarah Buxton, Mari Morrow, Nick Mancuso and Robert Miano. The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on September 13, 2005. Plot Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal) is a Robin Hood- esque thief who has always picked his own jobs and tried to pull heists that would leave him room to help out others. The work keeps getting riskier, and at the urging of his girlfriend Jada (Mari Morrow), Banks has decided to pull one final job, going in with some men who are planning a $20 million robbery. After the heist goes bad, Banks heads to Las Vegas, where Jada wants him to get a real job. On the way to town, Banks and Jada passed a children's hospital displaying a going out of business sign. Banks gets a job driving an armored car for a man, Max (Kevin Tighe). The job is not exactly legitimate, and Bruno (Robert Miano), Banks' partner for the job, shoots a security guard, resulting in a chase through the Vegas strip in the armored van. However, Banks is stopped and sent to prison, where he befriends an inmate known as Ice Kool (Treach). With Ice's help, Banks escapes, determined to hunt Max down. Along the way, Banks meets a federal agent named Saunders (Nick Mancuso), and it turns out that Saunders, who is in league with Max, is the man behind the setup. So Banks sets out to take down both Saunders and Max with a job. Cast Production It is set and filmed at Sofia, Bulgaria and Las Vegas, Nevada in 56 days on October 4 and November 29, 2004. Legal troubles The producers of Today You Die filed lawsuits against Seagal because of experiences during the filming. Producers at Nu Image and Kill Master Productions alleged that Seagal, while filming this and Mercenary for Justice, arrived at the set late, left early, and re-wrote scripts without their permission, among other things. However, Seagal disputed the suit, and he countersued against producers, claiming fraud and breach of contract. , it appears the legal issues had not been resolved.

The event offers a purse of $150,000. History The event is named in honor of Kelso, Allaire du Pont's five-time winner of American Horse of the Year honors. Kelso won the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park five times (1960-1964) consecutively at the then distance of 2 miles on the dirt. Fittingly NYRA scheduled the inaugural running of the Kelso Handicap over two miles at Aqueduct on 23 October 1980. At the time the event was the only $100,000 two mile event on the dirt in the US. The former claimer Peat Moss won the inaugural event as a 24-1 longshot in a time of 3:24. Peat Moss would repeat his winning ways the following year carrying a high-weight of 126 pounds. The 1982 running would be the last time the event would be held at the marathon distance. In 1983 the event was not held. On 20 October 1984 the event was renewed as a miles turf race on an all stakes card at Belmont Park which included the Jockey Club Gold Cup inheriting the classification status of Grade III from the Brighton Beach Handicap which became defunct with its last race on 24 August 1983. In 1988 the event was shortened to one mile. In 1997 the event was upgraded to Grade II. In 2009, it had been originally being scheduled for turf before being moved to the main track due to extremely heavy rain the day before and consequently was down graded to Grade III. In 2010 the event was moved to the main dirt track. Of the more notable winners of the event is Lure. Lure ran in the event three times winning in 1993 and finishing second twice in 1992 and 1994. In 1992 although finishing second as a three year old later that year he went on to win the Breeders' Cup Mile. In 1993 after winning this event he followed up in his next start winning the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park. In 1994 Lure just failed to win the event, beaten by a nose carrying 128 pounds and giving 14 pounds to the winner Nijinsky's Gold in a thrilling stretch battle.

Pharmasave produces a line of over 700 Pharmasave Brand products. History Pharmasave was created in 1981 through the merger of two British Columbia-based pharmacy chains, United Pharmacy and Western Drug Mart.Salt Spring Pharmasave history Locations Pharmasave's national office is located in Langley, British Columbia. Its stores are located in nine provinces and territories across Canada and are organized into 2 regions with each region having their own regional offices: West (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Yukon), and East (Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island). Management Each of Pharmasave's stores operates independently and they range in size from small dispensaries to large-format home healthcare pharmacies. Each region has a Board of Directors as well as representation on the national Board of Directors. Pharmasave's business model is one of self- governance, where pharmacy owners are elected to serve on its regional Boards of Directors. This way, the needs of the owners are served by other owners, and not by a separate corporate entity. The success of this model has played an important part in the attracting of new members and its growing store count across the country.

Genes are designated to a specific location on a chromosome known as the locus and can be used as molecular markers to find the distance between other genes on a chromosome. Maps provide researchers with the opportunity to predict the inheritance patterns of specific traits, which can eventually lead to a better understanding of disease-linked traits. The genetic basis to gene maps is to provide an outline that can potentially help researchers carry out DNA sequencing. A gene map helps point out the relative positions of genes and allows researchers to locate regions of interest in the genome. Genes can then be identified quickly and sequenced quickly. Two approaches to generating gene maps include physical mapping and genetic mapping. Physical mapping utilizes molecular biology techniques to inspect chromosomes. These techniques consequently allow researchers to observe chromosomes directly so that a map may be constructed with relative gene positions. Genetic mapping on the other hand uses genetic techniques to indirectly find association between genes. Techniques can include cross-breeding (see Hybrid (biology)) experiments and examining pedigrees. These technique allow for maps to be constructed so that relative positions of genes and other important sequences can be analyzed. Physical mapping Physical mapping techniques used to generate a gene map include: Restriction mapping, Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and Sequence tagged site (STS) mapping. =Restriction mapping= Restriction mapping is a method in which structural information regarding a segment of DNA is obtained using restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes are enzymes that help cut segments of DNA at specific recognition sequences. The basis to restriction mapping involves digesting (or cutting) DNA with restriction enzymes. The digested DNA fragments are then run on an agarose gel using electrophoresis, which provides one with information regarding the size of these digested fragments. The sizes of these fragments help indicate the distance between restriction enzyme sites on the DNA analyzed, and provides researchers with information regarding the structure of DNA analyzed. =Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)= FISH is a method used to detect the presence (or absence) of a DNA sequence within a cell. DNA probes that are specific for chromosomal regions or genes of interest are labeled with fluorochromes. By attaching fluorochromes to probes, researchers are able to visualize multiple DNA sequences simultaneously. When a probe comes into contact with DNA on a specific chromosome, hybridization will occur. Consequently, information regarding the location of that sequence of DNA will be attained. FISH analyzes single stranded DNA (ssDNA). Once the DNA is in its single stranded state, the DNA can bind to its specific probe. =Sequence- tagged site (STS) mapping= A sequence-tagged site (STS) is a short sequence of DNA (about 100 - 500 base pairs in length) that is seen to appear multiple times within an individual's genome. These sites are easily recognizable, usually appearing at least once in the DNA being analyzed. These sites usually contain genetic polymorphisms making them sources of viable genetic markers (as they differ from other sequences). Sequenced tagged sites can be mapped within our genome and require a group of overlapping DNA fragments. PCR is generally used to produce the collection of DNA fragments. After overlapping fragments are created, the map distance between STSs can be analyzed. In order to calculate the map distance between STSs, researchers determine the frequency at which breaks between the two markers occur (see shotgun sequencing) Genetic mapping Genetic mapping is focused on the principles first established by Gregor Mendel. This approach primarily focuses on linkage analysis and gene association techniques. =Linkage analysis= The basis to linkage analysis is understanding chromosomal location and identifying disease genes. Certain genes that are linked or associated with each other are found to reside close to each other on the same chromosome. During meiosis, these genes are capable of being inherited together and can be used as a genetic marker to help identify the phenotype of diseases. Because linkage analysis can identify inheritance patterns, these studies are usually family based. = Gene association analysis = Gene association analysis is population based; it is not focused on inheritance patterns, but rather is based on the entire history of a population. Gene association analysis looks at a particular population and tries to identify whether the frequency of an allele in affected individuals is different from that of a control set of unaffected individuals of the same population. This method is particularly useful to identify complex diseases that do not have a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Utilizing gene maps: disease genes Using the methods mentioned above, researchers are capable of mapping disease genes. Generating a gene map is the critical first step towards identifying disease genes. Gene maps allow for variant alleles to be identified and allow for researchers to make predictions about the genes they think are causing the mutant phenotype. An example of a disorder that was identified by Linkage analysis is Cystic Fibrosis. For example, with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), DNA samples from fifty families affected by CF were analyzed using linkage analysis. Hundreds of markers pertaining to CF were analyzed throughout the genome until CF was identified on the long arm of chromosome 7. Researchers then had completed linkage analysis on additional DNA markers within chromosome 7 to identify an even more precise location of the CF gene. They found that the CF gene resides around 7q31-q32 (see chromosomal nomenclature).

The party making a payment is commonly called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment. Payments can be effected in a number of ways, for example: * the use of money, cheque, or debit, credit or bank transfers. * the transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, the exchange of one good or service for another. In general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit. Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee, unless if the parties agree otherwise. Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction. The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept a part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc. Payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill, which follow the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is becoming common for pre-payments to be required before the service is performed or provided. In some industries, a deposit may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider. In some cases, progress payments are made in advance, and in some cases part payments are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer’s legal obligations. The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer. A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as \\"paid in full\\". The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment. Etymology  The root word \\"pay\\" in \\"payment\\" comes from the Latin \\"pacare\\" (to pacify), from \\"pax\\", meaning \\"peace\\". In the Middle Ages, the term began to be used more broadly, to mean \\"to pacify one's creditors\\". As the Latin word was made part of Old French \\"paier\\", it retained the meaning \\"appease\\" but gained the meaning \\"to pay\\" (as in paying a debt). The Middle English word \\"payen\\", which came from French, was also used in both ways.The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 350.  Methods  There are two types of payment methods; exchanging and provisioning. Exchanging involves the use of money, comprising banknotes and coins. Provisioning involves the transfer of money from one account to another, and involves a third party. Credit card, debit card, cheque, money transfers, and recurring cash or ACH (Automated Clearing House) disbursements are all electronic payments methods. Electronic payments technologies include magnetic stripe cards, smartcards, contactless cards, and mobile payments.  Parties involved  A payment may involve more than two parties. For example, a pre paid card transaction usually involves four parties: the purchaser, the seller, the issuing bank and the acquiring bank. A cash payment requires at least three parties: the seller, the purchaser and the issuer of the currency. A barter payment requires a minimum of two parties: the purchaser and the seller.  Providers  The infrastructure and electronic clearing methods are formed by the payment provider. Global credit card payment providers are Diners Club, Visa, American Express and MasterCard. Maestro and Cirrus are international debit card payment providers.  Interbank  The central bank CB(Ccy) of a currency can maintain a loro account for a bank (which the bank would call a nostro account). = Direct = A bank P (the payer) with a central bank nostro can pay directly to another bank R (the receiver) which has also a nostro with CB(Ccy) by instructing the central bank to make a payment of N[Ccy] (or an amount N in Ccy). The central bank however will only accept Ps payment instruction if the balance B on P's loro account before the payment is B≥N. The payment itself is a booking in the loro accounts of the central bank where P's loro account is debited with N (it will be B-N≥0 thereafter) and simultaneously Rs loro account is credit with N (its balance C will be C+N≥0 thereafter). We denote the payment symbolically with [P→CB→R]. = Indirect = If the payer P maintains a loro account for another bank X, P can act as a payment agent for X: X instructs P to pay to R; then P instructs CB(Ccy) to pay on behalf of X: [X→P→CB→R]. In this example the first half of the payment is indirect and the second one (from CB(Ccy) to R) is still direct. If X would pay via P to R and finally to another party Y, the payment would be 'fully indirect': [X→P→CB→R→Y]. In practice, not every payment agent might have a direct nostro with the central bank, thus rather weird payment constellations can exist, which are hard to describe. = Directness coefficient (p,q) = If we define (p,q) where p is number of parties on the sender side and q on the receiver side, we can classify the directness of payments. = Sn,Rm Description = We denote with Sn the senders and with Rm the receivers in a payment process, such that R0=S0=CBCCY is the central bank of the currency which has 'no' distance (n=m=0) to the payment process, m,n=1: the direct nostro agents of the sender / receiver: S1 is the direct payer; R1 is the direct receiver (or nostro agent) m,n=2: the indirect nostro agents of the sender / receiver: S2 is the indirect payer; R2 is the indirect receiver m,n=3: the sender / payer bank : S3 is the sender bank; R3 is the receiver bank m,n=4: the sender / payer: S4 is the sender (payer); R4 is the receiver (payee) Here is an (p=q=4) example: [sender→sender bank → indirect agent of sender bank → direct agent of sender bank → central bank → direct agent of receiver bank → indirect agent of receiver bank → receiver bank → receiver(payee)] or [S4 → S3 → S2 → S1 → S0=R0 → R1 → R2 → R3 → R4]  Global market  In 2005, an estimated $40 trillion globally passed through some type of payment system. Roughly $12 trillion of that was transacted through various credit cards, mostly the 21,000 member banks of Visa and MasterCard. Processing payments, including the extending of credit, produced close to $500 billion in revenue.McKinsey and Company, 2006 In 2012, roughly $377 trillion passed through noncash payment systems. This led to total account and transaction revenues close to $524 billion.Boston Consulting Group, \\"Global Payments 2013\\", September 2013 = Debit cards = In the U.S., debit cards are the fastest growing payment technology. In 2001, debit cards accounted for 9 percent of all purchase transactions, and this is expected to double to 18.82 percent in 2011.The Nilson Report, Issue 761, April 2002 = Cheques = Historically, cheques have been one of the primary means of payment for purchasing goods and services, though its share in the payment mix is falling worldwide. In 2001, in the United States, cheques accounted for 25% of the U.S.-based payment mix; and in 2006, this was projected to fall to 17%.The Nilson Report In the United States, a cheque as a form of payment can legally be refused for any reason (or no reason).' A payment by cheque is not a \\"payment\\" until the cheque has been cashed (i.e., deposited) and cleared by the banking system.  Timing  The timing of a payment has legal implication in some situations. For tax purposes, for example, the timing of a payment may determine whether it qualifies as a deduction in a taxpayer's calculation of taxable income in one year or the next. For U.S. tax purposes, cash payments generally are taken to occur at the time of payment. Payment may also occur when a person transfers property or performs a service to the payee in satisfaction of an obligation.See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007). A payment by check is normally deemed to occur when the check is delivered, as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee. This rule also generally applies where the check is not presented to the bank until the next taxable year, and even though the payer could stop payment on the check in the meantime.Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner, 12 T.C. 524 (1949). Postdated checks, however, are not considered payment when delivered.Griffin v. Commissioner, 49 T.C. 253 (1967). Generally, payments by credit card take effect at the point of the sale and not when a payer is billed by the credit card company or when the payer pays the credit card company's bill.Revenue Ruling 78-38, 1978-1 C.B. 67. A business that reports on an accrual basis, would report income in the year of sale though payment may be received in a subsequent year. Payment of most fees to government agencies by cheque, if permitted, usually takes effect after a set number of days for clearance or until the cheque is actually cleared. Payments by credit card, if permitted, and cash payments take immediate effect. Normally, no other forms of payment are permitted or accepted.

Babcock Piano Wooden Sound Board with Iron Strings Alpheus Babcock (September 11, 1785 – April 3, 1842) was a piano and musical instrument maker in Boston, Massachusetts and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the early 19th century. Babcock is best known for patenting a complete iron frame in a single casting used to resist the strain of the strings in square pianos, he also patented a system of stringing in squares, and improvements in piano actions. Biography Babcock was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and worked for musical instrument maker Benjamin Crehore (d.1828) before 1809. He established a workshop and music warehouse in Boston with brother Lewis at 44½ Newbury Street, but by 1812 they entered a partnership with organ maker Thomas Appleton (1785–1872) with workshops at 6 Milk Street. Following Lewis' death in 1814 the surviving partners formed a brief partnership with brothers Charles and Elna Hayt, the business was taken over by Mackay & Co., with Crehore's former partner, organ maker William Goodrich (d. 1834) as one of the partners, and by 1817 reorganized as The Franklin Music Warehouse with Joshua Stevens as foreman, continuing at Milk street under John Rowe Parker through 1823. Babcock may have worked during this period in Philadelphia, but by 1822 worked at the rear of 11 Marlboro street, Boston and moved the following year to Parkman's Market, Cambridge street. The Mackays continued an association with Babcock throughout the 1820s, with many of the instruments labelled \\"for G. D. Mackay\\" and \\"for R. Mackay\\". Babcock received a silver medal at the 1824 Exhibition of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, as well as in 1825, and in 1827 a silver medal and special mention for a square with his patented solid cast-iron frame (1825). In 1830 he relocated to Philadelphia, at the time the largest producer of pianos in the United States, where he patented what he called \\"cross stringing\\", and introduced resilient cloth hammer coverings. He was associated with instrument maker and seller John C. Klemm, his former agent, and by late 1832 worked as foreman for piano maker William Swift, at whose warehouse at 142 Chestnut street, he advertised in The Daily Chronicle in 1833, one could see iron framed pianos for which he claimed sole manufacturing rights. Babcock won honors at the 1833 Franklin Institute exhibition, along with C. F. L. Albrecht of Philadelphia, and Nunns & Co. of New York. Babcock returned to Boston in 1837 employed by Chickering & Mackays who had formed a partnership in 1830. Babcock's improvements helped Chickerings lead the American piano industry through the 1850s. Notes # Ripin and Kuronen indicate \\"G. D. Mackay\\" as George Mackay, d. 1824, nephew of John Mackay (Boston Industrialist), and \\"R. Mackay\\" as Ruth, (1744–1833) widow of Mungo Mackay, and mother of John Mackay, but Holman writes she died 1820, and that John Mackay was married to her daughter Fanny. # For \\"the best horizontal piano\\", a square \\"made for J. Mackay, of Boston\\" with \\"the strings of the lower octaves... covered with flattened wire\\" Spillane, p. 86 # Not related to over stringing, this invention involved twisting shared wires at the hitch pins. # Babcock assigned his 1839 patent to John Mackay, William H. Mackay and Jonas Chickering. John Mackay, like George D. Mackay in 1822, had given Babcock's address in 1825, 1828, and 1829 Boston Directories. References *\\"Biographical Memoir of William M.

The eastern wing is on the right. An exhibition in the Palais de Tokyo / Site de création contemporaine. The Palais de Tokyo (Tokyo Palace) is a building dedicated to modern and contemporary art, located at 13 avenue du Président- Wilson, facing the Trocadéro, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. The eastern wing of the building belongs to the City of Paris, and hosts the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (Museum of Modern Art of the City of Paris). The western wing belongs to the French state and since 2002 has hosted the Palais de Tokyo / Site de création contemporaine, the largest museum in France dedicated to temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. The building is separated from the River Seine by the Avenue de New-York, which was formerly named Quai Debilly and later Avenue de Tokio (from 1918 to 1945). The name Palais de Tokyo derives from the name of this street. History The monument was inaugurated by President Lebrun on May 24, 1937, at the time of the International Exhibition of Arts and Technology of 1937.www.paris.fr : History of Palais de Tokyo The original name of the building was Palais des Musées d'art moderne (\\"Palace of the Museums of modern art\\"). The building has since then hosted a number of establishments, projects, and creative spaces. Among them; le musée d'art et d'essai (1977–1986), the FEMIS, the Centre national de la photographie, and in 1986 the Palais du cinéma. The current contemporary art center opened to the public in March 2002 under the new name \\"Site de création contemporaine (Site for contemporary creation]\\", specializing in the emerging French and international art scene. With no permanent collection, it is not a museum and produces all of its exhibitions. Director In March 2002, Nicolas Bourriaud and Jérôme Sans launched the Site de création contemporaine in the west wing of Palais de Tokyo. Endowed with a restricted operating budget, but run by a brilliant and committed team, it soon became simply known as Palais de Tokyo, quickly making its mark as a trendsetter in the art world. Marc-Olivier Wahler directed the Palais de Tokyo from 2006 to 2012. Under Wahler's leadership, the Palais de Tokyo became one of the city's best springboards for young artists. Jean de Loisy served as President of Palais de Tokyo from 2012 until 2018. In 2019, Emma Lavigne was chosen to become his successor; she became the first woman to hold the post since its launch.Gareth Harris (July 22, 2019), Emma Lavigne lined up as new president of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris The Art Newspaper. Le Pavillon The Pavillon was established in 2001. Intended as a studio and laboratory space for resident artists and curators invited to the project, the Pavillon is an experimental program, designed to demonstrate the resident artists' youthful creativity. Since the opening of the building, the director of the programme has been artist and filmmaker, Ange Leccia. Palais / The Museum also publishes the magazine Palais /, which annually releases three editions (Spring, Fall, and Summer) and was created in 2006 by Marc-Olivier Wahler. The Magazine features articles centering around a central artistic theme selected for each edition. The subjects are conceptual, and are explored using photography, various artistic media, essays, and often experimental media. The theme generally coincides with the exhibition concurrently featured at the museum. In addition to Palais /, Palais de Tokyo also published five volumes of a contemporary art encyclopedia, From Yodeling to Quantum Physics between 2007–2011.

They formed in 2003 and were signed to Drive-Thru Records. On June 9, 2009 they announced their official breakup.  History  =Formation (2002-2004)= Shortly after the New Jersey ska punk group Face First disbanded in 2002, singer/guitarist Tom \\"Chitty\\" Keiger, bassist Jarrett Selzer, trumpeter Rich \\"Okie\\" Okamoto and drummer Tommie Clayton decided to reunite to play a poppier, more synthesized form of modern punk rock. Therefore, Okamoto switched from trumpet to keyboard, and Kenny Ryan, formerly of Hidden in Plain View, joined as a second guitarist. The name \\"Houston Calls\\", according to the band, is a combination of chapter titles from the Apollo 13 DVD. Other choices included \\"Zoltar Madness\\" (from Big), \\"Giant Green Insanity\\" (from The Toxic Avenger), and \\"Deeds in NY\\" (from Mr. Deeds). They released a 2-song demo CD in 2003 at the Skate and Surf festival (Asbury Park), even though they did not play at the event. It included the tracks \\"One More Won't Hurt\\" and \\"A Line in the Sand.\\" \\"One More Won't Hurt\\" and \\"A Line in the Sand\\" were both Face First's final songs, and were re released without the horn parts for the demo CD. While they began performing live in June 2003, they soon released their 4 Song Sampler, produced by Hidden in Plain View's Rob Freeman, to help spread the word. After only one national tour Clayton and the band parted ways and he later joined the band Spoiler NYC. Through mutual friends, Josh Grigsby was introduced to the band and became their drummer on May 15, 2004. Due to various national tours with bands such as Hidden in Plain View and Hellogoodbye, Houston Calls' fanbase grew steadily. The newly manned five-piece went into the studio with producer Jesse Cannon, to record their Sampler Volume 2 (2004). A few months after its release in August 2004 and a national tour sponsored by PureVolume and Absolutepunk.net with Hidden in Plain View, hellogoodbye, Madison, and Action Action, Houston Calls became the second band to sign with Rushmore Records, a sister record label of Drive-Thru Records, which the band has had friendly relations with ever since their formation. Immediately preceding the release of their debut effort - they embarked on a US tour with Self Against City and Adelphi. During which their van and trailer were stolen in Smyrna, Georgia at a Holiday Inn Express. =A Collection of Short Stories (2005-2007)= On August 2, 2005, the band's official debut album, A Collection of Short Stories, was released. Produced by Ed Rose at Black Lodge Studios in Eudora, KS, the CD contained eleven songs, three of which had previously been released on their two samplers. The release was followed by tours with Allister, Fenix TX, The Rocket Summer, JamisonParker, Just Surrender, Quietdrive, Sherwood, Amber Pacific, and others as well as an Australian tour with Yellowcard, and Independence-D festival in Japan. On November 25, 2006, Ryan announced he was leaving the band due to personal financial problems. No hard feelings were felt by the band members and Ryan is still a close friend with the band. His last show was played at the Hamilton St. Cafe in New Jersey on December 15, 2006.

The program is the stated official policy of North Korea. The plan's original title was 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country. It regards the idea of reunification with South Korea under a pan-national unified state, a Federation, leaving the two systems and governments intact while opening the borders. The program proposes to remove outside influence from the Korean peninsula, especially the US forces based in South Korea, and proposes cooperation on trade and foreign affairs as a reunified country. The North Korean foreign policy is still dominated by this original document, which has led to better relations with South Korea, beginning with Kim Dae-jung's Sunshine Policy, and in the June 15th North-South Joint Declaration. The ten point program 1\\\\. A unified state, independent, peaceful and neutral, should be founded through the great unity of the whole nation. The north and the south should found a pan-national unified state which can represent all parties, groupings and all the members of the nation from all walks of life, while leaving the existing two systems and two governments as they are. The pan-national unified state should be a federal state in which the two regional governments of the north and the south are represented on an equal footing, and an independent, peaceful and nonaligned neutral state which does not lean to any great power. 2\\\\. Unity should be based on patriotism and the spirit of national independence. All the members of the nation should link their individual destinies with destiny of the nation, warmly love the nation and unite with one will to defend the independence of the nation as its life and soul. With the dignity and pride of our nation, they should reject flunkeyism and national nihilism that erode the nation's consciousness of independence. 3\\\\. Unity should be achieved on the principle of promotion coexistence, coprosperity and common interests and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification. The north and the south should recognize and respect the existence of different ideas and ideologies and systems, and enjoy progress and prosperity together, neither side encroaching upon the other. They should promote the interests of the whole nation before regional and class interests and direct all efforts to the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification. 4\\\\. All manner of political disputes that foment division and confrontation between the fellow countrymen should be stopped and unity be achieved. The north and the south should refrain from seeking or fomenting confrontation, cease all manner of political disputes and stop hurling abuses and slanders at each other. They, the same fellow countrymen, should not be hostile to each other but jointly counter foreign aggression and interference by the united efforts of the nation. 5\\\\. They should dispel fears of invasion from the south and from the north, prevail-over-communism and communization altogether and believe in and unite with each other. The north and the south should not threaten and invade the other. Neither side should try to force its system on the other and to absorb the other. 6\\\\. They should set store by democracy and join hands on the road to national reunification, not rejecting each other for the difference in isms and principles. They should ensure freedom of debate on and activity for reunification and not suppress, make reprisals on, persecute and punish political opponents. They should not charge anyone with pro-north or pro-south tendencies but release and reinstate all the political prisoners so that they may contribute together to the cause of national reunification. 7\\\\. They should protect material and spiritual wealth of individual persons and organizations and encourage them to be used favorably for the promotion of great national unity. Not only before the reunification but after it they should recognize the state ownership, cooperative ownership and private ownership and protect the capital and property of individual persons and organizations and common interests with foreign capital. They should recognize social honor and qualification of individuals in all domains including science, education, literature, art, speech, the press, health service and sports, and continue to ensure the benefits granted to persons of meritorious services. 8\\\\. The whole nation should understand, trust and unite with one another through contacts, travels and dialogues. All the obstacles to contacts and travels should be removed and the door be flung open for travels to all without discrimination. All the parties, groupings and people of all social standings should be given equal opportunities for dialogue and bilateral and multilateral dialogues be developed. 9\\\\. The whole nation in the north and the south and overseas should strengthen solidarity with one another on the way to national reunification. Things beneficial to national reunification should be supported and encouraged in an unbiased manner and things harmful be rejected together in the north and the south and overseas, and all should keep pace and cooperate with each other, each going beyond his own narrow enclosure. All the political parties, organizations and people of all walks of life in the north and the south and overseas should be allied organizationally in the patriotic work for national reunification. 10\\\\. Those who have contributed to the great unity of the nation and to the cause of national reunification should be highly estimated. Special favors should be granted to those who have performed feats for the great unity of the nation and the reunification of the country, patriotic martyrs and their descendants. If those who had turned their back on the nation in the past return to the road of patriotism, remorseful of their past, they should be treated leniently and be assessed fairly according to their contributions to the cause of national reunification.

It was composed in 1970 and premiered in autumn of the same year at the Donaueschingen Festival. The work is scored for two ring-modulated pianos; each player is also equipped with a chromatic set of crotales (antique cymbals) and a wood block, and one player is equipped with a short-wave radio producing morse code or a magnetic tape recording of morse code. In his catalogue of works, the composer designated it as work number 32. History Stockhausen on 2 September 1972 at the Shiraz Arts Festival, at the sound controls for Mantra Stockhausen had been interested for several years in writing something for the Kontarsky piano duo, and by early 1969 he had become determined to do so (; ). On a flight from the Northeastern United States to Los Angeles in September 1969 or shortly before, he had sketched \\"a kind of theater piece for two pianos\\" titled Vision, and in March 1970 began to work out a score, but broke off after just three pages (; ). During an automobile trip from Madison, Connecticut to Boston, a melody came to Stockhausen, along with the idea of expanding such a musical figure over a very long period of time—fifty or sixty minutes. He jotted the melody down on an envelope at that time, but it only occurred to him after having abandoned Vision that this might become the basis for his new two-piano composition. Stockhausen later recalled that this was early in September 1969 , but the sketch is in fact dated 26 February . Later in the year, on 22 September 1969 at the Couvent d'Alziprato in southern France, he had composed an intuitive music text composition, Intervall, for two pianists playing \\"four-hands\\" (on one piano), but it did not appeal to the Kontarsky brothers—especially to Alfons, who lacked the experience his brother Aloys had gained from performing text-pieces from Aus den sieben Tagen, as a member of Stockhausen's ensemble. Intervall, eventually premiered by Roger Woodward and Jerzy Romaniuk, later became part of Stockhausen's second cycle of intuitive-music compositions, Für kommende Zeiten . Stockhausen mentioned his wish to write something for the Kontarsky brothers to Heinrich Strobel, director of the Music Division of the SWF Baden-Baden and Artistic Director of the Donaueschinger Musiktage für Zeitgenossische Tonkunst and, toward the end of 1969, Strobel commissioned a work for two pianos for the 1970 Donaueschingen Festival . After abandoning Vision, Stockhausen took up the melody he had jotted down the previous September and on its basis made a form plan and laid out the new work's skeleton between 1 May and 20 June 1970 in Osaka, Japan. He then completed the score in an unbroken stretch of work at his home in Kürten from 10 July to 18 August 1970. Alfons and Aloys Kontarsky gave the premiere of Mantra in Domaueschingen on 18 October 1970, and made the first recording of the work from 10 to 13 June 1971 at the Tonstudio Kreillerstraße 22 in Munich, for Deutsche Grammophon . The score first appeared in print only in 1975, as one of the first publications of the composer's newly founded Stockhausen-Verlag . Structure Stockhausen at the sound desk for Mantra, Seraye Moshir, Shiraz, 2 September 1972 The piece is the first determinate work (that is, the score is completely written down, though there are some passages involving a modest degree of improvisation) that Stockhausen composed after a long phase of indeterminate compositions . This work involves the expansion and contraction of a counterpointed pair of melodies, which the composer calls a \\"formula\\" . In this particular work (the first of a long succession of compositions to use formula technique), Stockhausen chose the term \\"mantra\\" in order \\"to avoid the words theme, row or subject, as in a fugue\\" (Stockhausen 2003, 2), and \\"Mantra\\" also became the title of the entire work. In Mantra, the two-strand formula is stated near the outset of the piece by piano I. According to the composer, the mantra \\"has thirteen notes, and each cymbal sound occurring once in the piece indicates the large sections—you hear the cymbal whenever a new central sound announces the next section of the work\\" . Although \\"the cymbals have the same pitches as the mantra and can thus mark the 13 form cycles of the two pianists … they are not identical\\", and \\"there are also some sections in which a larger number of cymbal strokes occurs” . Though this mantra recurs constantly, the structure of the composition is not a theme and variations as found in classical composers such as Beethoven and Bach, because the material is never varied, only expanded and contracted (both in duration and in pitch) to different degrees; not a single note is ever added, it is never \\"accompanied\\" or embellished . The comparatively strict predetermination of the form plan is occasionally broken and altered through the use of insertions, additions, and small deviations and exceptions . Near the end of the composition there is an extremely fast section that is a compression of the entire work into the smallest temporal space; in this section, all of the expansions and transpositions of the mantra formula are summarized as fast as possible and in four layers . Thirteen-note tone row and its inversion. Everything in the work is based on this row and, in addition, it is used to define the large-scale structure of the piece by providing a series of tonics by means of the ring modulation. The prime form of the row is used in piano I's oscillator, the inversion in piano II's oscillator, with one note from each row form in each of the work's thirteen sections (; ; ; ). The \\"mantra\\" (melody formula) is made of an upper and lower voice; it is divided temporally into 4 segments with rests of 3, 2, 1, and 4 crotchets' duration following the segments. The 13 notes of the mantra's upper voice form a 12-tone row where the 13th note returns to the first note A. The lower voice consists of an intervallic inversion of the upper voice with transposed segments: the first segment of the lower voice corresponds to the inversion of second segment of the upper voice and vice versa; similarly, the third and fourth segments in the inverted voice are also exchanged . The pitches are shown in the example to the right, and the complete formula can be seen at Nordin [n.d.]. Each of the 13 notes of the mantra has an attached characteristic, or \\"pitch form\\" (; ); the 13 notes of the upper voice have in order the following characteristics: # periodic repetition at the beginning (on A in the original transposition) # accent at the end of a duration on B # G without any characteristic # a turn around the beginning of the note E # slow tremolo between F and D # an accented chord at the end of the F–D oscillation # a sharp accent (with a single repetition) at the beginning of a duration on G # a descending chromatic scale connecting the G to the following E # staccato (very short duration) on D # irregular repetition (\\"Morse code\\") of the note C # an inverted (upper-note) mordent (trill nucleus) on the beginning of B # sharp attack with an echo: sfz (fp), on G # arpeggio connecting the previously articulated pitch (E flat in the other voice, an augmented eleventh lower) upward to A In addition to its articulative characteristic, each of the thirteen notes is assigned a particular dynamic, in approximate inverse proportion to its duration—that is, the softer a note's dynamic is, the longer is its duration. The very first note is the sole exception to this rule : a. with constant intensities: :pp: 5.5 x = character V :p : 6 x = character XIII :p : 4 x = character IV :p : 1 x = character I (exception) :mp : 4 x = character XI :mp : 3 x = character III :mf : 1 x = character VI :f : 1 x = character IX b. with crescendo or decrescendo: :(m)p > : 7 x = character X :< mf : 2 x = character VIII :sfz (fp) : 2 x = character XII :(p)–f : 2 x = character II, where f = 1 x :ff > : 5 x = character VII, where ff = 1 x The thirteen cycles of the composition are based on the 13 notes of the mantra and the 13 characteristics detailed above. Each cycle is dominated by its corresponding note and characteristic. In this way, a single statement of the mantra is spread over the length of the entire composition, though the durations of the mantra notes are not incorporated into this overall plan . The sounds of each piano are picked up by microphones and fed into an apparatus at the player's left side. This is called a Modul 69 B and was specially built for Mantra to the composer's specification by the Lawo company from Rastatt, near Baden-Baden . It consists of a microphone amplifier with three microphone inputs, a compressor, a filter, a ring modulator, a scaled sine-wave generator, and a volume control. By means of this device, each piano's sounds are ring modulated with a sine tone tuned to the central pitch corresponding to the note of the mantra formula governing each of the thirteen large segments of the composition, and the modulated sound is played over loudspeakers placed behind and above the performers. The first pianist presents the upper thirteen tones, the second pianist the lower thirteen tones. Because the starting/ending pitch of the mantra is successively transposed onto these central pitches, they sound completely \\"consonant\\", like ordinary piano tones. The other mantra pitches sound \\"dissonant\\" to varying degrees, and differ also from a normal piano to varying degrees in their timbre. \\"Hence one perceives a continual 'respiration' from consonant to dissonant to consonant modulator sounds, resulting from the precisely tuned relationships between the modulating sine tones and the modulated piano notes\\" .

The screenplay was by Richard Brooks from the novel The Last Hunt, by Milton Lott. The music score was by Daniele Amfitheatrof and the cinematography by Russell Harlan. The film stars Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger, with Lloyd Nolan, Debra Paget and Russ Tamblyn. Plot Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) sets out on his last hunt with his new partner, the obsessive Charles Gilson (Robert Taylor). While McKenzie has grown tired of buffalo hunting, Gilson derives a pleasure from his \\"stands\\" – killing an entire herd of buffalo at one time. When Gilson chases down and kills an Indian raiding party, he takes an Indian woman and her child captive. The presence of the native woman causes tension and Gilson becomes increasingly paranoid and deranged, leading to a stand-off between the two former partners. In the final scene, McKenzie and the woman emerge from shelter to find that Gilson, though wearing a buffalo hide as protection from the cold, has frozen to death during the night, while waiting to ambush them.

This is the real thing, a gritty, tough, exciting story reeking with the pungent smells of dead buffalo and of dirty men.\\" W.R. Burnett called it an \\"undeniably able and interesting book.\\" Development MGM bought the film rights and announced it as a vehicle for Stewart Granger in February 1955. \\"It's real Americana\\", said the star. Richard Brooks was assigned the job of adapting and directing. The film was the first of only three westerns directed by Brooks, and was his first film following the critically acclaimed Blackboard Jungle (1955). In March Robert Taylor was announced as co-star. Russ Tamblyn was then given the lead support part as a half Indian. Lloyd Nolan was also cast – his first film role in over a year and a half, during which time he had played The Caine Mutiny Court Martial on stage. Anne Bancroft was cast as the Indian girl. Production Eighty percent of the movie was shot on location over a seven-week period. This took place at the Badlands National Park and Custer State Park in South Dakota during the then-annual \\"thinning\\" of the buffalo herd. Actual footage of buffalo being shot and killed (by government marksmen) was used for the film. Harvey Lancaster of Custer was the main marksman for the filming. The story takes place during the winter but was actually filmed during the scorching summer months in Custer State Park. When temperatures reached triple digits, Stewart Granger, whose costume consisted of full winter clothing, passed out from heat exhaustion and the crew had to cut away his clothes to revive him. Granger and director Brooks were reportedly not fond of one another, especially after Brooks married Granger's ex-wife, Jean Simmons. After three weeks of filming, Anne Bancroft was injured during filming after falling from a horse. She was replaced by Debra Paget.

The cartoons criticized American conservatives on matters where Objectivists and conservatives traditionally disagree, such as on religion, abortion, immigration and government regulation of business. In general, the comics were known for focusing heavily on the War on Terror, attacking Islamic fundamentalism and the religious right, defending Israel, and advocating war against countries such as Iran: > The Iranian theocracy is the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism and > a direct threat to America.

Biography  The band formed in 1995, initially as Imperial,Chris Mitchell: Interview with Krieg, 8 May 2004, accessed on 7 April 2013. changing name to Krieg in 1997 to avoid confusion with other bands named Imperial. Krieg released their début album Rise of the Imperial Hordes in 1998 and also recorded a second studio album called Sono Lo Scherno, which was not released at the time. Some of the tracks were used on the split with Kult ov Azazel and the compilation The Black Plague.Ryan Harding: LORD IMPERIAL 2002 Interview, 2002, accessed on 7 April 2013. In 2001, Krieg played with Godless North and Inquisition on the North American Black Metal Invasion tour through Germany, where they were supported by the German band Secrets of the Moon.Secrets of the Moon TOURDATES ! ! !, accessed on 7 April 2013. At Krieg's show at Die Festung in Bitterfeld on 8 December 2001, Imperial dedicated his set to Kanwulf of Nargaroth,Krieg: Kill Yourself or Someone You Love, Breath of Night Records/Merciless Records 2002. who was beaten up by NSBM band Absurd's vocalist Ronald Wolf Möbus for threatening to kill the latter's son (who was about one year old at the time).Shaddai: Lügen und Halbwahrheiten um „Kanwulf von Nargaroth“, accessed on 7 April 2013.Absurd Interview, accessed on 7 April 2013. The show was recorded and released on the live EP Kill Yourself or Someone You Love. In 2003, Krieg released splits with Antaeus and Satanic Warmaster, who, according to Imperial, \\"fit into my holy trinity of current black metal bands\\" together with American band Black Witchery,Pete: Interview with Imperial of Krieg, August 2004, accessed on 7 April 2013. as well as a split with Goat Semen, Necroplasma and Nazxul, and one with Open Grave. The band also released the album The Black House, backed up by a tour with Demoncy and Abazagorath. In 2004, Krieg announced a final album called The Harmony Virus. Imperial explained he would disband Krieg \\"[b]ecause, for now, I have almost reached the goals I have set out for myself. Perhaps KRIEG could return after I have pursued my next projects to their fullest. We shall see.\\" He also announced a split single with the Canadian band Lust. In 2005, Blue Miasma was released as Krieg's final album. The album was recorded at Winterblut Studio (Germany), Studio One (USA), and Orchard Studio (USA) in 2005, and released via No Colours Records and Darkland Records. In 2006 Krieg, with Noctuary as tour mates and backing band, toured the West Coast of the US, with added dates in Mexico. The band split up in 2006, and reformed once again in 2008 and played shows in L.A. and San Francisco. They have recently released a split and are working on a full- length. In 2014 Krieg was to release its second record on Candlelight Records titled \\"Transient\\".  Musical style and lyrics  The band's frontman, Imperial, was inspired to form Krieg by \\"[a] need to express the emotions inside me, which were empowering, crippling and consuming. […] For me, it’s always been about my vision and my word. The only way to express that in perfection is to do it without any outside interference unless permitted.\\" Imperial is in a \\"constant struggle for control in my life\\", including a minor nervous breakdown in 2004 and \\"a heavy dosage of Valium to control a very violent outburst\\". Imperial is \\"heavily influenced by his dementia and nightmares\\".Krieg, accessed on 7 April 2013. Beherit, Archgoat, Darkthrone, Forgotten Woods, Demoncy, Judas Iscariot, Lugubrum, Pest, Satanic Warmaster, Black Crucifixion, Hellhammer, Burzum, Profanatica and Havohej \\"have assisted in forming my music background\\", whereas influences \\"in the non traditional sense I am extremely influenced by Lou Reed's 'Berlin' album, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges, Danzig/Samhain, early Laibach, Incantation (only with Craig Pillard), Earth (us), and a lot of fucking doom\\". Krieg have \\"never been about the usual Satanic black metal subjects, but rather a despondent vision of morbid nihilism\\".~Vargscarr~: Interview with KRIEG. In: Maelstrom, no. 6, accessed on 7 April 2013. According to MusicMight, who called them an \\"uncompromising underground Black Metal legend\\", Krieg \\"deal in the rawest of Black Metal delivered in a style and tempo all of their own\\". Rock Hard journalist Björn Thorsten Jaschinski called Krieg a productive band and described their early works as chaotic, sloppily played black metal inspired by Profanatica and Havohej.Björn Thorsten Jaschinski: Krieg. The Isolationist. In: Rock Hard, no. 285, accessed on 7 April 2013. In his introduction to an interview with Lord Imperial, Ryan Harding wrote that American black metal bands are \\"arguably at our best when following the chaotic standard established by the likes of Beherit and the raw evil of Profanatica, as demonstrated by Demoncy and, of course, Krieg\\". Compared to earlier releases, The Black House, \\"whilst equally aggressive, leaned towards a more groove laden and some might say accessible approach\\", though \\"[t]he caustic primitivism of […] early recordings is still very much inherent\\". The album's lyrics deal with \\"the dissection of my psyche\\", rebellion, \\"descent, anger turned within\\", \\"one way to envision how death feels from the perspective of the dying\\", hopelessness/helplessness, betrayal, sexual depravity and murder without the burden of conscience. The Patrick Bateman EP is \\"a recording unlike any Krieg recording, with absolutely no regard for musical ideas but rather sheer violence and insanity, closer to ambient done completely with metal instruments. When this is finally released it will shock people and hurt a lot of feelings, but that’s always been a positive thing for me.\\" According to Blabbermouth, Blue Miasma \\"is the longest KRIEG work — with a running time of about one hour — and continues to explore different moods and atmopsheres [sic!] that were begun with 2004's 'The Black House'\\". The album had been announced by Imperial as \\"the most depressing, experimental and nastiest Krieg release ever\\" and is based on nightmares that Imperial has experienced since childhood, \\"though each year with each new trauma only grew more and more macabre. This album needed to have everything audible in order to give the listener a piece of what I go through constantly. Therapy through music, better living through chemistry.\\" According to Jaschinski, the chaotic, sloppily played style would still be dominating their later album The Isolationist, though the album included ambient elements and was more experimental.

The style was developed by Ittōsai Kagehisa. Ono- ha Ittō-ryū is the oldest of the many Ittō-ryū styles which branched off from Ittosai Kagehisa's original art. It continues to be one of the most influential of the traditional kenjutsu styles today, exerting a major influence, along with Hokushin branch, upon modern kendo's kata, tactics, and aesthetic. Ono-ha was founded by Ittosai's immediate successor, Ono Jiroemon Tadaaki (1565–1628), from whence the name of the art is derived. Oral tradition indicates that Ittosai made Tadaaki fight a serious duel with another student, Zenki, in order to establish a successor to the style. Serving as an instructor to both the second and third shōguns, along with Yagyū Munenori of the rival school the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Tadaaki was able to continue to give his art wide exposure. It was said that Tadaaki was Munenori's superior in swordsmanship, but that his severe character led him to be the less favoured and respected of the two. Known as a dueling style which focused upon the sword rather than a more multifaceted, multi-weapon, battlefield style, Ono developed a mock sword (see: shinai) in order to reduce training injuries and allow more committed fighting practice. From a technical standpoint this style consists of more than 150 techniques for both long and short swords. Kiri-otoshi, which translates simply as \\"cutting down\\", is still the defining technique, like that of its parent style. Characteristically, practitioners often feel that they have the ability to strike freely due to their technique of cutting down the centre-line during an opponent's cut in order to displace their attacker's sword and gain victory. The style adheres to a philosophy articulated in the phrase \\"itto sunawachi banto\\" or \\"one sword gives rise to ten thousand swords,\\" meaning that a thorough understanding of the fundamental technique of cutting will lead one to understand the myriad variations. Although formally established as a system for unarmoured fighting, the techniques maintained an awareness of the demands and tactics of armoured fighting, making the techniques adaptable to such circumstances. The transmission of the system passed out of the Ono family briefly and was maintained by the feudal lord Tsugaru Nobumasa. The second headmaster from this family taught Ono Tadakata, allowing the Ono family to continue preserving the line while the Tsugaru family continued their practice of the art, thereby having two families maintain the main line of the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū tradition thereafter. The Tsugaru family also taught the system to members of Yamaga family, and they worked together to preserve the line of their art. Sasamori Junzo, a well known and high ranking kendo practitioner, took over the preservation of the system in the Taishō period and his son, Sasamori Takemi, succeeded him as the 16th headmaster of the system. Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū was founded by Mizoguchi Shingoemon Masakatsu, who was a student of the second headmaster of Ono-ha Ittō-ryū, Ono Jiroemon Tadatsune, before creating his own style, the Mizoguchi-ha. Ito Masamori, a student of Mizoguchi's, visited the Aizu clan and taught Edamatsu Kimitada an incomplete version of the art. Ikegami Jozaemon Yasumichi, a student of Edamatsu, was sent by the daimyō (feudal lord) to study the sword methods to be found in Edo (present-day Tokyo). Combining methods learned there with the original teachings of Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū, he created a distinct Aizu line of the Mizoguchi-ha school with many significant differences in technique. This is the line that survives today, as the original line has disappeared. Watching a demonstration of the Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū it easily distinguishable from its parent art, the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū, and the Nakanishi-ha and Itto Shoden Muto- ryū. The kata used in these styles bear a close resemblance to each other. The Mizoguchi-ha at times looks like an entirely different art rather than just a different branch of the Ittō school, although employing some similar tactics. Many of the kata seem more overtly instructive in their orientation, teaching tactics to the left and then to the right. The curriculum consists of five long-sword and three short-sword techniques with omote (outside/surface) and ura (inner/more sophisticated) versions. Being a traditional school of the Aizu clan, which was based in Fukushima, it is currently maintained by the Fukushima prefecture and local kendo federations. There is also a group of practitioners in Kōbukan kendo club (Nakano, Tokyo) lead by Hiroshi Ozawa senseiOzawa sensei demonstrating Mizoguchi -ha Ittō-ryū at China University of Technology in Taipei, Taiwan that regularly demonstrates Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū at annual Kyoto Enbu Taikai.2016 Kyoto Enbu Taikai Match Schedule Although Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of Daitō-ryū, claimed to maintain the traditional teachings of the Aizu clan, according to his son, Tokimune, the core of his approach to the sword, although modified, was based upon the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū rather than Mizoguchi-ha. Nakanishi-ha Ittō-ryū was founded by Nakanishi Chuta Tanesada who studied under either the 5th or 6th generation headmaster of Ono-ha Ittō-ryū, before establishing his own style. His son revolutionized practice by implementing the use of shinai, a bamboo mock sword, in conjunction with bōgu, a protective armor. (Shinai were already used in Shinkage-ryū, Nen-ryū, and Tatsumi-ryū by this time.) Using the equipment to allow swordsmen to practice techniques freely and engage in sporting matches, foreshadowing the rise of modern kendo, led to the rapid popularity of the Nakanishi branch of Ittō-ryū. Stylistically the Nakanishi branch is said to more closely resemble its source, the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū, than do any other branches of the Ittō-ryū. The kata practiced on the surface appear to be identical in form but differ in such aspects as timing, breathing, and use of distance. The Nakashima branch is marked by its wide stances and deliberate movements, which confer a feeling of power and dignity. This style, like the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū, employs the use of the heavily padded glove known as the \\"onigote,\\" to allow forceful finishing strikes practiced as the denouement of each kata. Many famous swordsmen have emerged from this ryū, some founding schools of their own. Some of the more prominent among them were: * Terada Gouemon (Founder of the Tenshin Ittō-ryū) * Shirai Toru (Successor to Terada) * Takayanagi Yoshimasa (Founder of the Takayanagi-ha Toda-ryū) * Asari Yoshinobu (Teacher to Yamaoka Tesshu) * Chiba Shusaku (Founder of Hokushin Ittō-ryū) * Takano Sazaburo (A key developer of modern swordsmanship). Takano, as a well known educator, was able to introduce swordsmanship into the public school system in Japan and was instrumental to the development of the Nihon Kendo Kata. Kogen Ittō-ryū was founded by Henmi Tashiro Yoshitoshi, a student of Sakurai Gosuke Nagamase, who in turn was an exponent of the Aizu branch of Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū. The Henmi dojo still stands in Saitama Prefecture. This is Ryunosuke Tsukue's sword school in the 1966 historical drama The Sword of Doom (大菩薩峠). Tatsuya Nakadai played the part of Ryunosuke in this film. Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hokushin Ittō-ryū (北辰一刀流) was founded in the late Edo period (1820s) by Chiba Shūsaku Narimasa (1794–1856). He was one of the last masters who was called a Kensei (sword saint). Ittō Shōden Mutō- ryū was founded by Yamaoka Tetsutaro Takayuki, better known as Yamaoka Tesshū, an exponent of Ono-ha Ittō-ryū and Nakanishi-ha Ittō-ryū, in both of which he received a license of full transmission. Tadanari-ha Ittō-ryū Tadanari-ha (Chuya-ha) Ittō-ryū (忠也派一刀流) was founded by Itoh Tenzen Tadanari. Tenshin Ittō-ryū Tenshin Ittō-ryū (天辰一刀流) was founded by Suzuki Naonoshin Akemitsu. He learned Yagyu-Shingan-ryu(柳生心眼流), Ono-ha Ittoh-ryu(小野派一刀流) in Sendai-Han, and learned Hokushin Ittoh-ryu(北辰一刀流) in Edo (1840). In 1857, he appointed the kenjutsu teacher of the Sendai-han. Then, he founded Tenshin Ittō-ryū (天辰一刀流) from the 3 schools. The School still stands in Sendai, Miyagi 21st century. Shinden Enshin Ittō-ryū Shinden Enshin Itto Ryu Battojutsu 神伝円心一刀流抜刀術 is the art of drawing and cutting with the Japanese Samurai Sword. This is a family art taught by Soke Machida Kenshinsai 町田剣心斎 of Noda-city, Chiba prefecture, Japan. The mother of Machida Kenshinsai Soke is from a prestigious samurai clan in Aizu area of Tokugawa era. Machida Soke was born in 1932, and was taught martial arts since he was 3 years old from his father and grandfather. Machida Soke believes that practicing martial arts is completely different from doing sports. The true martial art is to attain the level of skills that could instantly kill the opponent. in Enbukan 円武館 philosophy you must not be afraid of anything. The root is not related to Ito Ittosai Kagehisa's kenjutsu. References Further reading *De Lange, William 2012. \\"Famous Samurai: Ono Tadaaki\\". Floating World Editions. *Draeger, Donn. 1973.

Fraser-Simson's music tended towards the old- fashioned European romantic songs, in contrast to the ragtime, jazz and other American dance music that began to be used in musicals during World War I. His other stage works include a ballet, Venetian Wedding (1926), and incidental music for The Nightingale and the Rose (1927). =Children's songs and later years= Fraser-Simson is also known for his many settings of children's verse by A. A. Milne and Kenneth Grahame, including the music for a children's play based on the latter's The Wind in the Willows entitled Toad of Toad Hall (1929), which was successful and enjoyed many revivals. His settings of Milne's verse include a children's song cycle The Hums of Pooh, based on verses from Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner. This was included in Julian Slade's 1970 adaptation of Winnie-the-Pooh. Fraser-Simson published six volumes of songs setting verses from Milne's When We Were Very Young. A number were first recorded for HMV in 1926 by George Baker, accompanied by the composer, and later again accompanied by Gerald Moore in 1930.Gammond, Peter. Sleeve notes to EMI LP HQM 1200 (1970) His other songs included the collection Teddy Bear and Other Songs and songs from Alice in Wonderland, which were published in 1932 and recorded by Baker and Moore the same year. Baker later recalled Fraser-Simson as \\"a very polite, retiring man, looking more like a businessman than a composer of successful musicals.\\" Simson married May Frances, née Bucknall, in 1897, with whom he had a daughter, Lilian Frances. He married his second wife, (Anna) Cicely Devenish, in 1919. In later years, he lived the life of a country squire at Dalcross Castle, a home that he bought in Scotland. He was an avid sportsman, enjoying golf, tennis, shooting and fishing. Fraser-Simson died at a nursing home in Inverness, Scotland, following a fall on a stone staircase at his home in nearby Croy, Highland, at the age of 71.  Notes  References *Gammond, P.

He is known for his former positions as Senior VP of Global Sports Marketing at Reebok, President of Sega of America, and Corporate Vice-President of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division, overseeing the Xbox and Xbox 360 game consoles. From 2007 to 2011 he was head of Electronic Arts' EA Sports game division. In 2012 he was appointed COO of Electronic Arts. He resigned from Electronic Arts in February 2017 to become CEO of Liverpool Football Club. It was announced in July 2020 that Moore would be leaving Liverpool Football Club at the end of August that year, having completed his three-year tenure with the club. Life and career Moore was born in Liverpool, England. He holds a bachelor's degree from Keele University, England, and a master's degree from California State University, Long Beach. He worked for Patrick USA, the US subsidiary of a French sportswear company, and then at Reebok for almost a decade. He also was a physical education teacher in Llangollen, North Wales, for a number of years. Peter Moore has now put his house for sale in Prenton but is looking to buy a new house on Noctorum Road, Newton. Preferably with an annexe. =Sega= After Reebok, Moore was hired by Bernie Stolar to work at Sega. Despite his son owning a Sega Saturn, Moore knew little about video games. However, Moore quickly rose to prominence at Sega, being a big figure in the company's North American operations during the Dreamcast era. Moore played a pivotal role in the company's decision to change its business strategy to become a platform- agnostic software publisher. At the time of leaving, Moore was president and COO of Sega of America. Moore has been proud of the success of the Dreamcast game console and the satisfaction that owners still express today; including fans of the Shenmue game franchise, which Moore describes as the most vocal fan base during his career at Sega. Moore disclosed to GamingSteve.com that at a security checkpoint at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a TSA security agent said \\"I don't need to see your passport. You're the asshole that gave away Shenmue to Xbox\\". Many blame Moore for using Sega as a career ladder while misusing Sega. However, Moore has admitted to being responsible for the discontinuation of the Dreamcast. He said: > We had a tremendous 18 months. Dreamcast was on fire – we really thought > that we could do it. But then we had a target from Japan that said we had to > make x hundreds of millions of dollars by the holiday season and shift x > millions of units of hardware, otherwise we just couldn't sustain the > business. So on January 31st, 2001, we said Sega is leaving hardware. We > were selling 50,000 units a day, then 60,000, then 100,000, but it was just > not going to be enough to get the critical mass to take on the launch of > PS2. Somehow I got to make that call, not the Japanese. I had to fire a lot > of people; it was not a pleasant day. During his stint at Sega, Moore also portrayed a zombie in the film adaptation of House of the Dead along with producer of the original game Rikiya Nakagawa. Both are credited at the end of the film under \\"Special Thanks\\". In 2012, a history book titled Service Games: Rise and Fall of Sega covered Moore's entire career at SEGA. =Microsoft= On January 20, 2003, Microsoft hired Moore to help the Xbox console to compete with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's GameCube. At Microsoft, Moore gained notoriety for displaying tattoos of Halo 2 and Grand Theft Auto IV that he used when announcing the respective games (the former was used to announce Halo 2's release date of 9 November 2004, while the latter was used to announce Grand Theft Auto IV). Some sources claim that the Halo 2 tattoo was not permanent and others have reported that Moore still has it. Moore also reportedly endorsed the Wii console as an alternative over the PlayStation 3, claiming that for the price of one PlayStation 3 (US$599 at the time), the consumer can buy both the Xbox 360 and Wii. =Electronic Arts= On 17 July 2007, Electronic Arts announced that Peter Moore would be leaving Microsoft to head the sports division at Electronic Arts. Moore reportedly wanted to move back to the San Francisco Bay area to live with his family, which was possible with EA. His position as Vice-President of Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft was filled by Don Mattrick (who later also left Microsoft to join Zynga as CEO). Moore was parodied in an episode of South Park, Season 15's Crack Baby Athletic Association, focusing on the NCAA's relationship with Electronic Arts. On 4 August 2011, Moore was promoted from EA Sports President to the role of chief operating officer in a structure reshuffle. In an interview with the game press on 20 June 2012, Moore predicts the radical shift of the gaming industry's business model towards free-to-play, he believed within 10 years the industry would have entirely shifted. Under his leadership, games such as Star Wars: The Old Republic and then still under development, Command & Conquer: Generals 2, changed focus from a single player campaign game into a free-to-play multiplayer game with microtransactions. On 10 December 2015, Moore was appointed as the \\"Chief Competition Officer\\" of EA's newly formed competitive gaming division. =Liverpool FC= Moore left EA and was announced as the new CEO of the Liverpool Football Club on 27 February 2017. Moore took up his new role, which comprises running the business of the club, on 1 June 2017 and reported directly to the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group. Moore stepped down as CEO at the end of August 2020 with Billy Hogan stepping up from his role as the club's managing director and chief commercial officer. During his tenure with the club, they won the Uefa Champions League, Fifa Club World Cup and the Premier League.

It was discovered and excavated in 1966 by Henry de Lumley. The site, originally on a prehistoric beach, contained tools of the Lower Paleolithic period, dated to about 400,000 BCE, as well as traces of some of the earliest domestication of fire in Europe.Henry de Lumley, La Grande Histoire des premiers hommes européens, p. 211, The site now lies beneath an apartment building and a museum of prehistoric Nice, where some of the objects discovered are on display. Principal discoveries The site was discovered during the construction of a terrace near the port of Nice in 1966. After negotiating with the owner of the site, DeLumley was given permission to work on the site from January 28 until July 5, 1966. He and his team worked seven days a week, and, at the end, twenty-four hours a day, to complete their work.De Lumley, p. 213. According to de Lumley, the site contained a settlement with several layers of habitation located on a fossil beach. The habitations dated to 380,000 BC, and included vestiges which suggested that the inhabitants lived in huts on the beach. In the center of each hut was a fireplace, with ashes showing that the inhabitants had domesticated fire. These signs of fire, along with those at Menez Dregan in the Finistère in France, at Beeches Pit in Suffolk, England, and at Vertesszollos in Hungary, are the earliest evidence of the domestication of fire known in Europe.Henry de Lumley, La Grande Histoire des premiers hommes européens, pg. 225. These vestiges included low walls of stones and beach pebbles, placed to the northwest of the fireplaces, which would have sheltered the fire from the strong Mistral wind. De Lumley believed the inhabitants built the huts of animal skins supported by poles, with a hole in the center for the smoke to escape. Twenty to forty people could gather in such a shelter. If his theory is correct, Terra Amata is one of the first discoveries of man-made human habitations in Europe. The site also included evidence that the inhabitants had manufactured tools out of the beach stones, including tools with two cutting faces and a particular kind of stone pick which was given the name '\\"Pics de Terra Amata.\\" They also discovered a large number of stone tools and scrapers in the dunes above the beach. Controversy A very different interpretation of the site was given later by another archeologist, Paola Villa, who dedicated part of her doctoral thesis to the same site. She argued that the conclusions reached by De Lumley were more conjectural than compelling. She said it was equally likely that the stones were naturally deposited through stream flow, soil creep or some other natural process. Villa also argued that stone artifacts from the different proposed living floors can be fitted together, showing that artifacts have moved up and down through the sediment column. Thus, the supposed living floor assemblages are most likely mixtures of artifacts from different time periods that have come to rest at particular levels. There was, she said, therefore compelling evidence that the site was subjected to relatively invasive post-depositional processes, which may also be responsible for the stone 'arrangements'. Villa argued that de Lumley had greatly overestimated the state of preservation of the original site, and that it was impossible to accurately date the objects because the layers could not be considered independent of each other. She also said that the site should be dated later than 380,000 BCE to approximately 230,000 BCE.

Located at an altitude of 574 m, about 5 km (3 mi) east of the state's capital Innsbruck in the Inn valley, it has a population of about 13,000 (Jan 2013). History Hall in the County of Tyrol was first mentioned as a salina (saltern) near Thaur castle in a 1232 deed. The current name dates back to 1256, and similarly to Halle, Hallein, Schwäbisch Hall or Hallstatt is derived from the Celtic word for salt. Since the 13th century the salt mine at Absam in the Hall Valley north of the town formed the main industry of the town and its surroundings. The first adit was laid out in 1272 at the behest of Count Meinhard II of Tyrol, with the brine channeled by a 10 km (6 mi) long pipeline to the evaporation pond at Hall. The importance of the salt industry, which exported goods as far as Switzerland, the Black Forest, and the Rhine valley, is reflected in Hall's coat of arms, which shows two lions holding a cask of salt. In 1303 Hall became a town. The rights that came with this, as well as the business associated with trading from Hall downriver on Inn and Danube, turned it into the leading market and trading place in the northern parts of Tyrol. Its development suffered a serious setback in 1447, when large parts of the upper town area were razed by a fire. In 1477 it got the right of coinage, when the Tyrolian mint was moved from Meran to Hall. In 1486 the mint produced the first large silver coin Guldengroschen in Europe. In the 16th century the mint in Hall also introduced the world's first automated coining machine. Today a reconstruction of this revolutionary machine can be seen in the Hall Mint Museum www.muenze-hall.at: Hall Mint Museum in the Burg Hasegg. In the 15th and 16th century, Hall was one of the most important towns in the Habsburg Empire. This period saw the construction of many of the churches, monasteries and convents that still shape the appearance of the town. Today Hall has the biggest intact old town in the western part of Austria. During the Habsburg Monarchy a military garrison was established in Hall. This, along with the large freight train station, became a target of heavy bombardment during World War II, which destroyed the train station but left the old town almost unscathed. From 1938 to 1974 the town was called Solbad Hall – Solbad was dropped from the town name a few years after the salt mining was closed in 1967.

In addition, the Uzbekistan national football team played some matches at the stadium. From 1992 until 2012, Pakhtakor Stadium was the main stadium, where the Uzbekistan national football team played home games. Since 2013, the main home stadium in Uzbekistan national team is Milliy Stadium. Construction of the stadium was started in 1954 and was completed in 1956. The architect of the stadium is Mitkhat Saghatdinovich Bulatov. Initially, the stadium accommodated 60,000 spectators, but over time, after a series of renovations in 1960, 1980, 1996, 2008 and 2012, the capacity of the stadium decreased to the current — 35,000. The first official match at the stadium was played on August 20, 1956 between the Pakhtakor and Dinamo Tbilisi football clubs, as part of the USSR Higher League. The first official international match was played on September 19 of the same year between Pakhtakor and Albanian Dinamo Tirana, which was also won by the Tashkent team.

It is based on Guy de Maupassant's story \\"Pierre et Jean.\\" The film, like much of Buñuel's work, criticizes bourgeois values, especially those of the highly superficial Don Carlos Montero. Buñuel himself considered it his worst film. Plot The film opens in Mexico, in the home of an upper-class antiques salesman named Don Carlos Montero and his wife Rosario, whose son, Carlos or Carlitos, is accused of stealing by the principal of his school. Carlitos is scolded harshly by his father when he comes home, and is locked in his room. Carlitos runs away, but is found by an engineer named Julio Mistral who works in the forest. Julio returns the boy to his parents, and Don Carlos is very grateful. Julio becomes great friends with the Montero family, but in private asks Rosario why she really married such a harsh mannered and older man. One day, Rosario and Carlitos pay a visit to Julio in the forest, while Don Carlos spends the day in town on business. Carlitos enjoys himself immensely, fishing for trout. Rosario and Julio converse privately, and Julio notes how unhappy she is. Rosario reveals that she is unhappy because she married Don Carlos for his money when she was very young. Julio sympathizes her plight as a woman who has never truly loved, and they fall in love with each other. Screenshot from Una mujer sin amor, Javier Loya and Rosario Granados. Rosario and Julio begin an affair, and Julio tries to convince her to run away with him to Brazil. She eventually agrees, but decides to wait, after Don Carlos suffers a severe heart attack. Don Carlos ultimately lives, and Rosario refuses to go with Julio, unable to separate Carlitos from his father, who had grown close since his illness. The film skips about 20 years into the future, where Carlos, and his younger brother, Miguel (not introduced in the first part of the film), have graduated from medical school. One day, news arrives that Julio Mistral has died and decided to will all of his money to Miguel. Initially, everybody is perplexed at this action, as Julio had never met Miguel. Though it is not explicitly stated in the film, Carlos soon pieces together that Miguel was willed this money because he is the illegitimate child of Julio and his mother, Rosario. Carlos refuses Miguel's offer to share his inheritance, which he uses to build a new clinic, and begins acting bitter towards his mother and brother. Miguel becomes engaged to be married to a woman who Carlos is convinced wants to marry him for his money. At his wedding, Don Carlos collapses and dies from a heart attack. The film comes to a conclusion as Carlos finally discloses the truth about the inheritance to Miguel, who becomes very angry and fights Carlos. Rosario breaks up the fight, and confirms what Carlos has said. Miguel is distraught, and Rosario unapologetically tells them that Julio was the only man she ever loved.

History Inaugurated in 1985 as the Riva Ridge Stakes, it was named in honor of the Hall of Fame inductee and Kentucky Derby winner, Riva Ridge. In 2006, it was renamed in memory of Hall of Fame trainer Woody Stephens, who won eight U.S. Triple Crown races including a record five consecutive editions of the Belmont Stakes. The event was classified as a Grade III in 1988, upgraded to a Grade II event in 1998, and in 2019 it was upgraded to Grade I. The race is part of the undercard for the Belmont Stakes and often includes horses that are cutting back in distance after attempting to qualify on the Road to the Kentucky Derby. The event has been won by champions including Lost in the Fog in 2005 who that year was the American Champion Sprint Horse, and the 1990 Champion 2YO Fly So Free. Also the 2014 winner Bayern would later that year win the Breeders' Cup Classic.

The station airs a hot adult contemporary format. CING's studios are located on Main Street West in Hamilton, while its transmitter is located atop the Niagara Escarpment near Upper Centennial Parkway. CING is owned by Corus Entertainment. CING was launched in 1976 by Burlington Broadcasting, at 107.9 FM in Burlington, Ontario. Initially an easy listening and then an oldies station, the station switched to a dance music format in the summer of 1991, which garnered a huge audience, after several months of adding new-age music to its mixture of classical and middle-of-the-road music. The station applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) a number of times in the 1980s for frequency changes in the hopes of better reaching the more lucrative Toronto market, but was denied each time.(CRTC), Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. \\"ARCHIVED - Decision CRTC 86-434\\".(CRTC), Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. \\"ARCHIVED - Decision CRTC 88-292\\". CING is one of the most powerful radio stations in Southeastern Ontario. Its signal can be heard in Hamilton, the Greater Toronto Area, the Waterloo Region, the Niagara Region, and even Buffalo, New York. The station is marketed towards both Hamilton and Toronto. History =FM 108 era (1976-1997)= CING-FM began on September 23, 1976, as a beautiful music format featuring mostly instrumental versions of pop favorites. The first song heard on the 107.9 FM frequency was \\"Sing\\" by The Carpenters. The station began experimenting with playing oldies during the overnight period in 1978; the response was positive, and by 1980 oldies shows constituted the majority of the program schedule. During the 1980s, FM 108 divided its programming between oldies and middle of the road music, and was known for its personable oldies announcers, including Glen Darling, Norman B., Steve Richards/Mortenson, Wes Atkinson, Burt Thombs, Clint Trueman, Mark Eustace,Jay Brown, Dale Patterson (webmaster for Rock Radio Scrapbook), the Shadow, Dave Terryberry, Larry Smith, and the infamous Rockin Robin. CING began to phase out its oldies programming in the fall of 1989 with the addition of dance music programming (\\"Rhythm Radio\\") in evenings and overnights; the station continued with its soft AC/MOR format during the rest of the day on weekdays, as \\"Daytime Lite and Rhythm at Nite.\\" Oldies programming was relegated to Saturdays. The last oldies show on FM 108, hosted by Dale Patterson, aired on September 29, 1990. \\"Daytime Lite\\" ended on September 2, 1991, and the dance format expanded full-time (first as \\"Dance 108\\", and then to \\"Energy 108\\" in the mid-1990s).Dance radio a wild success story, Greg Quill, Toronto Star, November 21, 1991 =Energy 108 era (1997-2001)= In 1997, the station was acquired by Shaw Communications. Following the change in ownership, Energy's format shifted from dance music to mainstream CHR. Dance, rap, hip-hop, rock, and pop all received equal airplay. A minor name change also took place, with Energy 108 changing to Energy Radio. Under Shaw's ownership, several other stations in Ontario, including CKDK-FM in Woodstock/London, CHAY-FM in Barrie and CKGE-FM in Oshawa/Toronto, also adopted the Energy Radio format, rebroadcasting CING much of the day. Shaw's radio operations were, in turn, spun off to Corus Entertainment in 1999. =Frequency switch; subsequent format changes (2001-present)= Broadcast area map for CING as of 2017. On August 31, 2001, CING and CJXY-FM swapped frequencies. CING moved to its current 95.3 frequency, and CJXY took over the 107.9 FM frequency. The frequency switch brought with it a change in the network's sound, with the mainstream CHR format making way for a hot adult contemporary format. With CING now available over a wider geographic area, the other stations dropped their CING simulcasts in 2002. The new format mirrored the format of Toronto's market leader CHUM-FM, which resulted in very low ratings. On August 9, 2002, at 6 p.m., the station dropped its troubled Hot AC format (and the \\"Energy\\" moniker), and began stunting with stand-up comedy bits. The final songs on \\"Energy\\" were \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer\\" by Snap! and \\"Happy Trails\\" by Roy Rogers. On August 19, 2002, at 7 a.m., the station flipped to country, branded as Country 95.3. The first song on \\"Country\\" was \\"Small Town Saturday Night\\" by Hal Ketchum.\\"Hamilton's Energy 95.3 crosses over to country\\".\\"Oldies back on 1090 AM\\". On November 13, 2009, at 3 p.m., CING-FM switched formats to classic hits, branded as Vinyl 95.3.\\"Country radio goes quiet\\". The final song on \\"Country\\" was \\"The Dance\\" by Garth Brooks, while the first song on \\"Vinyl\\" was \\"Start Me Up\\" by The Rolling Stones. The station's playlist featured the greatest hits of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, and was considered to be the first oldies/classic hits station in the Greater Toronto Area on FM after the CRTC permitted the oldies format to be heard full-time on FM for the first time. Locally, the station competed against AM station CKOC; after Christmas of that year, the station also competed against adult hits station CHBM-FM in Toronto, which lost their oldies outlet on CHUM, which flipped to a simulcast of CP24 in March of that year. In its latter months, the station broadened their playlist to include 90s and current tracks. With this change, however, the station's ratings began to slide. Fresh FM logo (2013-2015)right150px On April 10, 2013, at 9:53 a.m., the station changed its format back to Hot AC, now branded as 95.3 Fresh FM.Corus expands FRESH FM to Hamilton , Canadian Radio News - RWCRN, April 10, 2013 The station became the fourth radio station owned by Corus to adopt the \\"Fresh FM\\" branding. While most of the previous format's airstaff (including Toronto market veterans Gord James, John Novak and Bob Saint) was let go, Darrin and Colleen remain in mornings with their producer Mike moving to evenings after a brief jockless period. On February 13, 2015, CING-FM rebranded to 95.3 Fresh Radio, in conjunction with Corus rebranding all of their \\"Fresh FM\\" stations to the new branding on the same date and time.\\"Corus Launches National Fresh Radio Brand Across Canada - RadioInsight\\". 13 February 2015. On March 26, 2019, at 8 a.m., CING-FM rebranded as Energy 95.3. The last song on \\"Fresh\\" was \\"Good Feeling\\" by Flo Rida, while the first song on the revived \\"Energy\\" was \\"High Hopes\\" by Panic! At the Disco. The change brought with it a new morning show, Tucker and Maura, formerly of CKFM in Toronto. Former morning hosts Colleen Rusholme moved to afternoon drive, while Darrin Laidman decided to leave the company. Later that year, Rusholme departed for Ottawa sister station CJOT-FM, and was replaced with the syndicated Brooke & Jubal, based out of KQMV in Seattle. CING is the second station in Canada to air the syndicated Brooke and Jubal show following Ottawa sister station CKQB-FM, and the first to air it in afternoons. CING competes with local stations CKLH-FM and CHRE-FM, as well as neighboring stations CHUM-FM and CHFI-FM (from Toronto) and CHYM-FM (from Kitchener).

She was born to Scottish parents in London while they were visiting the city and brought up in Aberdeen, Scotland. Longing to act, she trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Her stage career took her from repertory theatre at the Bristol Old Vic and Pitlochry, to West End appearances including Noël Coward's Present Laughter, Mame with Ginger Rogers, An Italian Straw Hat, Anyone for Denis?, and Deathtrap. The Scotsman wrote: \\"In the Sixties, she was often seen in series such as The Saint, Public Eye and Sherlock Holmes. But she gained a national popularity when she went into Crossroads in 1967 as Mrs Cornet. It was the era when the soap was hugely popular and Noelle Gordon ruled the motel with a rod of iron...She played Lady Rosina in the BBC’s mammoth production of The Pallisers, Aunt Morag (keen on her sherry) in Hinge and Bracket's TV series Dear Ladies, Auntie Ethel in Moody and Pegg. She was also seen in the first run of Dr Finlay's Casebook.\\" But Sheila Keith remains best known for her excellent performances in the cult horror films of director Pete Walker, having played leading roles in shockers such as House of Whipcord, Frightmare, House of Mortal Sin, The Comeback and House of the Long Shadows. She played variously, a lesbian prison warder, a one eyed housekeeper, and an elderly cannibal, amongst other parts. In her obituary, The Times described her as an \\"Actress of film, stage and television who became a 'British horror icon' ...It was with her portrayal of sinister, sadistic and deranged women in the horror movies of the director Pete Walker that she acquired her most devoted following\\". Sheila Keith also had a memorable role as the Reverend Mother Stephen opposite Arthur Lowe, in all three series of the LWT sitcom Bless Me, Father. Her final role was in the first episode of a horror spoof TV series, Dr. Terrible's House of Horrible, starring Steve Coogan, in 2001.

He made 306 appearances in the Football League and Football Conference between 1996 and 2012, most notably spending ten years at Cheltenham Town. Career =Early career= Born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, Higgs began his career as a trainee at Bristol Rovers. He joined York City on loan in September 1995, but failed to make any appearances for the team. He made his league debut for Rovers on 19 November 1996 in a 2–1 defeat to Burnley. However, he was unable to stake a regular claim and was given a free transfer to non-League Worcester City in 1998, after making 10 appearances for Rovers. =Cheltenham Town= He spent a single season with Worcester, before being signed by Cheltenham Town for £10,000 in 1999, after impressing in an FA XI v Southern Football League representative match in 1998. He spent nearly four years as reserve to Steve Book, making only a handful of appearances, before finally breaking into the first team in March 2003. He then become their firm number one and winning the club's Player of the Year award twice. Whilst at Cheltenham he gained two promotions and was a fixture in Cheltenhams first team for many years. His spell at Cheltenham came to an end when he joined Wolves on loan and after his contract expired at Cheltenham he left the club to join Leeds United on a free transfer. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= He joined Wolverhampton Wanderers of the Championship on a month's loan on 27 November 2008, twice extended to reach the end of the season. However, he did not make an appearance for the club as they won promotion. He acted as number two goalkeeper whilst Wolves goalkeepers Matt Murray, Wayne Hennessey and Carl Ikeme had all faced spells on the sidelines.http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/Higgs-savours-big- chance/article-511767-detail/article.htmlhttp://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham- sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/wolves-fc-news/2009/01/21/mick-mccarthy-is- eager-to-keep-shane-higgs-97319-22744779/ Before he moved to Leeds Wolves manager Mick McCarthy highly recommended Higgs to Leeds manager Simon Grayson. =Leeds United= He joined the then League One now Championship side Leeds United on a free transfer on 3 July 2009, signing a one-year contract.http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/Higgs-won-t-settle-bench- duty-Leeds/article-1137056-detail/article.html Higgs' chance came in pre- season against Newcastle United and after a string of fine saves in the game and keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw, Higgs retained his place for the friendlies against Blackburn Rovers and Burnley where he continued to impress. Higgs started the season as first-choice goalkeeper after fierce competition from former number one Casper Ankergren, and he helped the club earn a valuable point away to Southend United, after saving a Lee Barnard penalty kick in a 0–0 draw. Higgs conceded his first goal from open play in the league in the 4–1 over Gillingham, which was the eighth game of the season. Higgs suffered an injury against Milton Keynes Dons and had to be replaced by Ankergren. It was revealed Higgs' injury was a thigh injury and he was expected to miss a few games as a result. Higgs returned from injury and started the game against Norwich City but suffered a recurrence of his thigh injury and had to be substituted. He was replaced by Casper Ankergren. He signed a new contract with Leeds in November 2009, which contracted him at the club until June 2011. Higgs was on the road to recovery, but still was not fit enough to return to the Leeds squad, as a result Leeds signed David Martin on loan as backup for Ankergren. After almost six-months out with injury, Higgs returned to Leeds' squad when he was named as a substitute in the loss against Millwall. Higgs returned to the starting line-up in the next game against Norwich City replacing understudy Ankergren. Higgs played an instrumental part as Leeds were promoted to the Football League Championship after finishing in second place in League One and thus earning automatic promotion, however Leeds' signing of Kasper Schmeichel, on 27 May 2010, put Higgs' position as number one under threat. After much speculation over pre-season who would be first choice goalkeeper for the forthcoming season, it was Kasper Schmeichel who was given the nod ahead of Higgs, when he made his debut for the club on 7 August 2010 in Leeds United's opening Football League Championship defeat against Derby County. Higgs came into the starting line-up for his first appearance of the season, coming into the starting line-up against Leicester City in the League Cup. Higgs came into the starting line-up against Swansea City after Kasper Schmeichel picked up an ankle injury. After conceding five against Barnsley in a 5–2 defeat, Higgs kept a clean sheet in the next game against Doncaster Rovers.http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20100917/united-held- at-doncaster_2247585_2157209 Higgs was substituted in the second half of the match against Ipswich Town after picking up an injury.http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20101002/ipswich-live_2247585_2171357 Higgs returned to Leeds' bench against Coventry City after recovering from injury.http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20101106/coventry-live_2247585_2209355 After playing just seven league games for Leeds in The Championship, after being understudy to Kasper Schmeichel, Higgs has left Leeds after it was announced the club were not renewing his contract.http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20110509/goalkeeper-higgs-to-depart- leeds_2247585_2356221 =Northampton Town= On 22 December 2011, it was announced that Northampton Town had signed Higgs on an 18-month contract.

It is a campus/community radio station owned and operated by the McMaster Students Union at McMaster University.  History  CFMU began as a project of the McMaster Radio Club in the late 1960s as a closed circuit AM station, under the auspices of the Board of Student Broadcasting. In 1976, CFMU applied for its first FM license from the CRTC for 107.9, but was denied in favour of a broadcaster in Burlington. CFMU was eventually launched on FM on January 13, 1978, broadcasting in mono at 50 watts. They were the third college radio station to launch in Canada, after CFRC from Queen's University and CJRT, which was started by Ryerson University. CFMU started out with a Wilkinson transmitter and 2-bay circularly polarized Phelps Dodge antenna. In 1985, CFMU petitioned successfully to move its transmitter from downtown Hamilton to the top of the escarpment, near Chedoke Hospital. In 1991, faced with a wattage increase at nearby CFRU-FM in Guelph, CFMU upgraded from 50 watts to a 250-watt stereo transmitter. In 2000, CFMU decreased to a 166-watt station and began sharing a tower at Mohawk College, with Mohawk's instructional station CIOI-FM. The station can be heard throughout much of Hamilton and Burlington, although their vertically polarized signal means the station can be heard farther on car radios.  Programming  CFMU has several long-running shows: * Classical Today hosted by Richard Kohar has been on the air for over 10 years. * Echoes from the Amber Coast - Gintariniai Aidai, a Lithuanian cultural show, has been on the air since the station launch in January 1978; * Leave Luck To Us debuted on February 2, 2008; * Live N Direct has been broadcast since 1996; * Lullabies in Razorland by Ric Taylor has been on the air for over 25 years; * In Tha Kut has been on-air for over 20 years. The station's programming includes local news and current affairs, politics, ethnic and religious community broadcasting, and local music, as well as a variety of genre shows.  Administration  CFMU employs several full-time and part-time staff and runs with the help of over 200 volunteers. CFMU relies on an annual fundraising drive, donations, show sponsorship, and grants to continue serving the community.  Awards  CFMU won Radio Station of the Year at the Hamilton Music Scene Awards in 2010. CFMU has won Radio Station of the Year from the Hamilton Music Awards ten times since the awards were founded in 2004, most recently in 2016. Director Rachel Connell won Music Director of the Year in 2016; Ben Robinson won the same in 2015.

The venue was planned to be one of the host stadiums for the unsuccessful bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It was intended to host Quarter-final matches if Morocco had been awarded the World Cup. It is now planning as a potential venue to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup as Morocco is gearing up its co-bidding with Portugal and Spain.

It was not a settlement site, but instead seems to have been a waterside location where animals could be hunted or scavenged when they died by hominids. The hominids used the tools to butcher the animals, although many of the animal bones from the site represent killings by other carnivores.

The monastery is located on the right bank of the Dnieper River on the edge of a bluff northeast of the Saint Sophia Cathedral. The site is located in the historic administrative Uppertown and overlooks the city's historical commercial and merchant quarter, the Podil neighbourhood. Originally built in the Middle Ages by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych, the monastery comprises the Cathedral itself, the Refectory of St. John the Divine, built in 1713, the Economic Gates, constructed in 1760 and the monastery's bell tower, which was added c. 1716–1719. The exterior of the structure was rebuilt in the Ukrainian Baroque style in the 18th century while the interior remained in its original Byzantine style. The original cathedral was demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, but was reconstructed and opened in 1999 following Ukrainian independence in 1991. History =11th to 19th centuries= Some scholars believe that Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavych, whose Christian name was Demetrius, first built the Saint Demetrius's Monastery and Church in the Uppertown of Kyiv near Saint Sophia Cathedral in the 1050s. Half a century later, his son, Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych, is recorded as commissioning a monastery church (1108–1113) dedicated to his own patron saint, Michael the Archangel. One reason for building the church may have been Svyatopolk's recent victory over the nomadic Polovtsians, as Michael the Archangel was considered a patron of warriors and victories. In 1906, a medieval hoard of silver and gold jewellery was discovered in a metal casket on Trekhsvyatytelska Street (Street of the Three Saints), opposite the gates of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. Gold jewellery from the hoard is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York while the silver jewellery and two ingots are in the British Museum, London. The hoard is dated to the 11th-12th centuries and was probably hidden at the time of the Tartar invasions and the Sack of Kyiv in 1240.Metropolitan Museum CollectionBritish Museum Collection The Mosaic of St. Demetrius was installed by Sviatopolk II in the monastery cathedral to glorify the patron saint of his father. The monastery was regarded as a family cloister of Svyatopolk's family; it was there that members of Svyatopolk's family were buried. (This is in contrast to the Vydubychi Monastery patronized by his rival, Vladimir Monomakh). The cathedral domes were probably the first in Kyivan Rus to be gilded, a practice that became regular with the passage of time and acquired for the monastery the nickname of \\"golden-domed\\" or \\"golden-roofed\\", depending on the translation. During the Mongol invasion in 1240, the monastery is believed to have been seriously damaged. The Mongols damaged the cathedral and removed its gold-plated domes. The cloister subsequently fell into disrepair and there is no documentation of it for the following two and a half centuries. By 1496, the monastery had been revived and its name was changed from St. Demetrius' Monastery to St. Michael's after the cathedral church built by Sviatopolk II. After numerous restorations and enlargements during the sixteenth century, it gradually became one of the most popular and wealthiest monasteries in Ukraine. In 1620, Iov Boretsky made it the residence of the renewed Orthodox metropolitan of Kyiv, and in 1633, Isaya Kopynsky was named a supervisor of the monastery. St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral in 1888 St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in the early 1900s The monastery enjoyed the patronage of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of Saint Barbara, alleged to have been brought to Kyiv from Constantinople in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Although most of the monastery grounds were secularized in the late eighteenth century, as many as 240 monks resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Yakiv Yatsynevych, either studied or taught at the school. In 1870, about 100,000 pilgrims paid tribute to St. Barbara at St. Michael's Monastery. Before the Russian Revolution in 1917, rings manufactured and blessed at St. Michael's Monastery, known as St. Barbara's rings, were very popular among the citizens of Kyiv. They usually served as good luck charms and, according to popular beliefs, occasionally protected against witchcraft but were also effective against serious illnesses and sudden death. These beliefs reference the facts that the Monastery was not affected by the plague epidemics in 1710 and 1770 and cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century. =Demolition of the cathedral and belltower= During the first half of the 1930s, various Soviet publications questioned the known historical facts regarding the age of the Cathedral. The publications stressed that the medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of the original Byzantine-style cathedral was preserved. This wave of questioning led to the demolition of the monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (previously located in the city of Kharkiv). Before its demolition (8 June – 9 July 1934), the structure was carefully studied by T.M. Movchanivskyi and K. Honcharev from the recently purged and re-organized Institute of Material Culture of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. On the basis of their survey, the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the Ukrainian Baroque style, rather than to the twelfth century as was previously thought, and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value. This conclusion backed up the Soviet authorities' plans to demolish the entire monastery. Local historians, archaeologists, and architects agreed to the monastery's demolition, although reluctantly. Only one professor, Mykola Makarenko, refused to sign the demolition act; he later died in a Soviet prison. In the mid-1930s, after the transfer of the Ukrainian capital from Kharkiv to Kyiv, a decision was made to demolish the cathedral and build administrative buildings in its place. For this purpose, in 1934 soviet authorities have decided to hold a competition for the project of the Governmental Center with a place for parades. In all of the projects submitted for the location in the area of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Square, the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral was demolished, except for one. The project of Joseph Karakis was the only one of four projects submitted for the competition with the location of the center in this place, in which the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral and the monument to Bogdan Khmelnitsky were preserved. However, at the end of the first round, the project of architect Peter Yurchenko was selected by the authorities as the most appropriate. This project, according to architect B. Erofalov, \\"was repeating the general scheme of the Karakis, but was done in a more frontal approach, with the liquidation of the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral. And if the location of the main volumes of the Karakis is asymmetric…\\" In March 1934, authorities decided to abandon the previous decision and announce a new competition, and at the end to choose the project of architect Joseph Langbard. Meanwhile, according to Oleg Yunakov's research based on archive documents, it is clear that although there is no cathedral in the projects of J. Langbard and P. Yurchenko, that was not the reason for the demolition, since the decision to demolish the monastery was adopted by the resolution of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in February 1934, and the dismantling of mosaics began to be produced already in 1933. On 26 June 1934, work began on the removal of the twelfth century Byzantine mosaics. It was conducted by the Mosaic Section of the Leningrad Academy of Fine Arts. Specialists were forced to work in haste on account of the impending demolition and were thus unable to complete the entire project. Despite the care and attention shown during the removal of the mosaics from the cathedral's walls, the relocated mosaics cannot be relied upon as being absolutely authentic. The remaining mosaics, covering an area of 45 square metres (485 sq ft), were apportioned among the State Hermitage Museum, the Tretyakov Gallery, and the State Russian Museum. The other remaining mosaics were installed on the second floor of the Saint Sophia Cathedral, where they were not on display for tourists. Those items that remained in Kyiv were seized by the Nazis during World War II and taken to Germany. After the war ended, they fell into American hands and were later returned to Moscow. During the spring of 1935, the golden domes of the monastery were pulled down. The cathedral's silver royal gates, Mazepa's reliquary (weighing two poods of silver) and other valuables were sold abroad or simply destroyed. Master Hryhoryi's five-tier iconostasis was removed (and later destroyed) from the cathedral as well. St. Barbara's relics were transferred to the Church of the Tithes and upon that church's demolition, to the St Volodymyr's Cathedral in 1961. During the spring-summer period of 1936, the shell of the cathedral and belltower were blown up with dynamite. The monastery's Economic Gate () and the monastic walls were also destroyed. After the demolition, a thorough search for valuables was carried out by the NKVD on the site. The resulting empty plot was joined with Sofiyivska Square, renamed Uryadova Square (Governmental Square) and was designated as the new city center and parade grounds. Soviet authorities then commissioned a competition how to best fill the empty plot; most architects, including Yakiv Shteinberg, suggested a huge Lenin statue. The square itself was planned as a rectangle with huge governmental buildings on the perimeter. Four pillars were planned with statues of workers, peasants and revolutionaries with flags standing on them. Some architects suggested to demolish the statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky in front of the Saint Sophia Cathedral and the Cathedral itself. The only building completed on the former monastery grounds before World War II currently houses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The construction of the second building (\\"the capital center\\"), planned to be built on the site where the Cathedral had once stood, was delayed in the spring of 1938 as the authorities were not satisfied with the submitted design. This building failed to materialize. Some time after demolition, the site where the former cathedral used to be located was transformed into a sport complex, including tennis and volleyball courts. The Refectory () of St. John the Divine was used for changing rooms. =Preservation and reconstruction= Commemorative plaque to Oles Honchar as the initiator of the monastery's revival In August 1963, the preserved refectory of the demolished monastery without its Baroque cupola was designated a monument of architecture of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1973, the Kyiv City Council established several \\"archaeological preservation zones\\" within the city; these included the territory surrounding the monastery. However, the vacant site of the demolished cathedral was excluded from the proposed Historic-Archaeological Park-Museum, The Ancient Kyiv, developed by architect A. M. Miletskyi and consultants M. V. Kholostenko and P. P. Tolochko. During the 1970s, Ukrainian architects I. Melnyk, A. Zayika, V. Korol, and engineer A. Kolyakov worked out a plan of reconstruction of the St. Michael's Monastery. However, these plans were only considered after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Eucharist mosaic is installed on the second floor of the Saint Sophia Cathedral. In 1973-1982 restoration of the Refectory Church of St. John the Theologian (the only building that survived the demolition of the 1930s) was held. Authors of the project - architect V. Shevchenko and architect I. Karakis (interiors and furniture). After Ukraine regained independence in 1991, the demolition of the monastery was deemed a crime and voices started to be heard calling for the monastery's full-scale reconstruction as an important part of the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. These plans were approved and carried out in 1997–1998, whereupon the cathedral and belltower were transferred to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate. Yuriy Ivakin, the chief archaeologist for the site, said that more than 260 valuable ancient artifacts were recovered during excavations of the site before reconstruction. In addition, a portion of the ancient cathedral, still intact, was uncovered; this today makes up a part of the current cathedral's crypt. With support of the Kyiv City Council, architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others restored the western part of the stone walls. The belltower was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with hands and a set of chimes (a total of 40) was installed from which today the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard. The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque icons, copies of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists. The newly rebuilt St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral was officially opened on 30 May 1999. However, interior decorations, mosaics, and frescoes were not completed until 28 May 2000. The side chapels were consecrated to SS. Barbara and Catherine in 2001. During the following four years, 18 out of 29 mosaics and other objets d'art from the original cathedral were returned from Moscow after years of tedious discussion between Ukrainian and Russian authorities. However, by the end of 2006, the remaining frescoes of the monastery are going to be transferred from the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg to Kyiv. They are placed in a special preserve that is owned by the municipality rather than the church body. = Headquarter of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine = The St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery became the headquarters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine after the church's creation on 15 December 2018. St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery is used as the headquarters of the Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine.

Featured landmarks А statue of the Archangel Michael Refectory of St. John the Divine =St. Michael Golden-Domed Cathedral= The religious architecture of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery incorporates elements that have evolved from styles prevalent during Byzantine and Baroque periods. The St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral () is the monastery's main church, built in 1108–1113 at the behest of Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych. The cathedral was the largest of three churches of St. Demetrius Monastery. The ancient cathedral was modeled on the Assumption Cathedral of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves. It used the Greek cross plan prevalent during the time of the Kyivan Rus, six pillars, and three apses. A miniature church, likely a baptistery, adjoined the cathedral from the south. There was also a tower with a staircase leading to the choir loft; it was incorporated into the northern part of the narthex rather than protruding from the main block as was common at the time. It is likely that the cathedral had a single dome, although two smaller domes might have topped the tower and baptistery. The interior decoration was lavish as its high- quality shimmering mosaics, probably the finest in Kyivan Rus, still testify. When the medieval churches of Kyiv were rebuilt in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in the Ukrainian Baroque style, the cathedral was enlarged and renovated dramatically. By 1746, it had acquired a new baroque exterior, while maintaining its original Byzantine interior. Six domes were added to the original single dome, but the added pressure on the walls was counteracted by the construction of buttresses. The remaining medieval walls, characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick, were covered with stucco. Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi was responsible for window surrounds and stucco ornamentation. Inside the church, an intricate five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov was installed in 1718. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out towards the end of the nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster. =Refectory of St. John the Divine= The refectory of the monastery is a rectangular brick building which contains a dining hall for the brethren as well as several kitchens and pantries. The Church of John the Theologian adjoins it from the east. The outside is segmented by pilasters and displays window surrounds reminiscent of traditional Eastern Orthodox church architecture. The refectory was erected in 1713, taking the place of the original wooden refectory. Its interior was overhauled in 1827 and 1837 and the restoration work was undertaken from 1976 to 1981.

The features of a shepherd's axe combine a tool with a walking stick, that could be used as a light weapon. It has symbolic historical and cultural connotations and is still used as a prop in many traditional dances, for example the odzemok. Languages Depending on the language, the axe is called as follows: ; , lit. \\"Romanian\\"; Polish (depending on the region): ciupaga, rąbanica, obuszek, cekanka, wataha, wataszka, the latter two from Romanian vătaf (\\"master shepherd\\"); ; ; , lit. \\"Romanian\\"; ). Appearance A shepherd's axe is a light axe with a long and straight wooden shaft, often with a metal butt. The length of the shaft is usually slightly more than 1 metre. The shafts were usually engraved as their owners had plenty of time for crafting. A small metal head-piece is sharp on one side while the other side is flat and can be used as a hammer. The head-piece is formed to fit comfortably into the hand so the shepherd's axe could be used as a walking stick. Today's shepherd's axes are mostly decorative, some having golden or silver head-pieces (mostly brass, iron, chromed iron, wood or aluminum - it is rare that any axe head would be made of solid gold or silver). Many are considered works of art (esp. those made up to the 1960s by highlanders). They were skillfully stamped/adorned according to ancient tradition. The main motifs were the sun, stars (whirl), comets, tree of life, flowers, trees such as fir or spruce, and various geometric designs. Some smiths used many different, elaborated stamps.  History and usage  The first written mention of the shepherd's axe comes from Emperor Qin Shi Huang's court.Magyar Demokrata, 2009-09-04, in Hungarian It is also depicted on Scythian imagery. The first users of the shepherd's axe were Eurasian nomads. Many of them were found in Avar graves. Besides the common Eastern steppe varieties, Avar influence too can be felt on the Hungarian shepherd's axes. In the 9th century, Magyar warriors used light axes on long shafts, called fokos, in their military arsenal during their invasion of Central Europe.Honfoglalás kori fokosok, balták és bárdok, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Zsolt Petkes, in Hungarian Apart from them, the Bulgars and also the Alans and Slavs used similar weapons. Vlach shepherds brought their shepherd's axes into Central Europe when they migrated along the Carpathian Mountains and Dinaric Mountains from the 14th through 17th centuries These were used by shepherds as versatile tools, providing a small axe, a supplemental hammer and a walking stick. Although a shepherd's axe could not be used to effectively cut down heavy trees, it was still able to cut smaller branches. In Slovakia and Poland, shepherd's axes were inseparable tools of native shepherds, together with heavy decorative belts. In the Slovak culture, the shepherd's axe was popularized by local historical legend Juraj Jánošík. In Hungary, modified axes were also used as martial weapons by Hungarian warriors in the early modern period, used, for example, in the 18th century in Rákóczi's War for Independence against Austrian soldiers. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hungarian Kuruc leader Imre Thököly and his soldiers used shepherd's axes as weapons. Hungarian shepherds in the northern regions used them also as tools. Many people of the Halychyna region were depicted holding bartka, particularly members of the local peasant resistance of the 19th century known as opryshky, often being associated with their more prominent leader Oleksa Dovbush.  Present-day usage  At present, shepherd's axes are still made and sold as souvenirs and for decorative purposes. They are also still used in many traditional dances. Occasionally they may be seen in the rural parts of the country where older men still use them as walking sticks. They are rarely used as tools or weapons.

Studies have shown that LADA patients have certain types of antibodies against the insulin-producing cells, and that these cells stop producing insulin more slowly than in T1D patients. LADA appears to share genetic risk factors with both T1D and T2D but is genetically distinct from both. Within the LADA patient group, a genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed with varying degrees of insulin resistance and autoimmunity. With the knowledge we have today, LADA can thus be described as a hybrid form of T1D and T2D, showing phenotypic and genotypic similarities with both, as well as variation within LADA regarding the degree of autoimmunity and insulin resistance. The concept of LADA was first introduced in 1993, though The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus does not recognize the term, instead including it under the standard definition of diabetes mellitus type 1. Symptoms The symptoms of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults are similar to those of other forms of diabetes: polydipsia (excessive thirst and drinking), polyuria (excessive urination), and often blurred vision. Compared to juvenile type 1 diabetes, the symptoms develop comparatively slowly, over a period of at least six months. Diagnosis A fasting blood sugar level of ≥ 7.0 mmol / L is used in the general diagnosis of diabetes.World Health Organization. (2016). Global Report on Diabetes. Geneva: World Health Organization. There are no clear guidelines for the diagnosis of LADA, but the criteria often used are that the patient should develop the disease in adulthood, not need insulin treatment for the first 6 months after diagnosis and have autoantibodies in the blood. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA), islet cell autoantibody (ICA), insulinoma-associated (IA-2) autoantibody, and zinc transporter autoantibody (ZnT8) testing should be performed in order to correctly diagnose diabetes. Persons with LADA typically have low, although sometimes moderate, levels of C-peptide as the disease progresses. Those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes are more likely to have high levels of C-peptide due to an over production of insulin. =Autoantibodies= Destruction of Glutamate decarboxylase (pictured here) via autoantibodies is strongly linked with LADA type 1 diabetes. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), insulinoma-associated (IA-2) autoantibodies, and zinc transporter autoantibodies (ZnT8) are all associated with LADA; GADAs are commonly found in cases of diabetes mellitus type 1. The presence of islet cell complement fixing autoantibodies also aids in a differential diagnosis between LADA and type 2 diabetes. Persons with LADA often test positive for ICA, whereas type 2 diabetics only seldom do. Persons with LADA usually test positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, whereas in type 1 diabetes these antibodies are more commonly seen in adults rather than in children. In addition to being useful in making an early diagnosis for type 1 diabetes mellitus, GAD antibodies tests are used for differential diagnosis between LADA and type 2 diabetesLatent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults; David Leslie, Cristina Valerie DiabetesVoice.org; 2003 and may also be used for differential diagnosis of gestational diabetes, risk prediction in immediate family members for type 1, as well as a tool to monitor prognosis of the clinical progression of type 1 diabetes.  Prevalence  Since there is no regular autoantibody screening, patients with LADA are at risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which makes it difficult to estimate the prevalence of LADA. Globally, it is estimated that about 8.5% of adults suffer from some form of diabetes and it is estimated that LADA accounts for about 3-12% of all adult diabetes cases.Carlsson S. (2019). Environmental (Lifestyle) Risk Factors for LADA. Current diabetes reviews, 15(3), 178–187. https://doi.org/10.2174/1573399814666180716150253. Estimates from 2015 are saying that there could be as many as 10–20% of people with diabetes having LADA.  Risk factors  There is limited research on LADA and its etiology. As with both T1D and T2D, the risk of LADA depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic risk factors for LADA are similar to T1D, i.e. is affected by the HLA complex, but also genetic variants associated with T2D have been identified in LADA. LADA has several lifestyle risk factors in common with T2D, such as obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and consumption of sweetened beverages, all of which are linked to insulin resistance. Obesity has been shown to increase the risk of LADA in several studies, and one study showed that the risk was particularly high in combination with having diabetes in the family.Hjort, R., Löfvenborg, J. E., Ahlqvist, E., Alfredsson, L., Andersson, T., Grill, V., Groop, L., Sørgjerd, E. P., Tuomi, T., Åsvold, B. O., & Carlsson, S. (2019). Interaction Between Overweight and Genotypes of HLA, TCF7L2, and FTO in Relation to the Risk of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults and Type 2 Diabetes. The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism, 104(10), 4815–4826. https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2019-00183. Physical activity also affects the risk of LADA, with less physical activity increasing the risk. A Swedish study showed that low birth weight, in addition to increasing the risk of T2D, increases the risk of LADA. Although smoking has been shown to increase the risk of T2D while coffee consumption has been shown to reduce the risk of T2D, the results regarding these products and LADA are unclear. However, results from two studies based on the same population seem to indicate that coffee consumption increases the risk of LADA. Other foods that have been shown to increase the risk of LADA are sweetened beverages and processed red meat while consumption of fatty fish has been shown to have a protective effect. Management Diabetes is a chronic disease, i.e. it cannot be cured, but symptoms and complications can be minimized with proper treatment. Diabetes can lead to elevated blood sugar levels, which in turn can lead to damage to the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves. There are very few studies on how to treat LADA, specifically, which is probably due to difficulties in classifying and diagnosing the disease. LADA patients often do not need insulin treatment immediately after being diagnosed because their own insulin production decreases more slowly than T1D patients, but in the long run they will need it. About 80% of all LADA patients initially misdiagnosed with type 2 (and who have GAD antibodies) will become insulin-dependent within 3 to 15 years (according to differing LADA sources). The treatment for Type 1 diabetes/LADA is exogenous insulin to control glucose levels, prevent further destruction of residual beta cells, reduce the possibility of diabetic complications, and prevent death from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although LADA may appear to initially respond to similar treatment (lifestyle and medications) as type 2 diabetes, it will not halt or slow the progression of beta cell destruction, and people with LADA will eventually become insulin-dependent. People with LADA have insulin resistance similar to long-term type 1 diabetes; some studies showed that people with LADA have less insulin resistance, compared with those with type 2 diabetes; however, others have not found a difference. History Although type 1 diabetes has been identified as an autoimmune disease since the 1970s, the concept of latent autoimmune diabetes mellitus was not noted until 1993, when it was used to describe slow-onset type 1 autoimmune diabetes occurring in adults. This followed the concept that GAD autoantibodies were a feature of type 1 diabetes and not type 2 diabetes.

The event currently carries a purse of $125,000. History The race was named after the great U.S. Racing Hall of Fame filly, Shuvee, winner of the 1969 Fillies Triple Crown. The inaugural running of the event was on 16 May 1976 at Belmont Park as the Shuvee Handicap as a one-mile event. The winner Proud Delta made an immediate impact for the event as she continued her winning ways to be crowned US Champion Older Dirt Female Horse. The following year the distance for the event was increased to miles and for the third running in 1978 the event was classified as a Grade II. The event was upgraded to Grade I in 1986, the year Lady's Secret won the event en route to a Breeders' Cup Distaff victory at Santa Anita Park and U.S. Horse of the Year honors. In 1995 the distance for the event reverted to its original one mile. In 1997 the event was downgraded to Grade II and in 2012 the event was not held. NYRA moved the event to Saratoga for the 2013 as they expanded the number of racing dates at that track. The event was downgraded to Grade III for its first running at the new track and the event holds this classification to date. Also that year the distance was increased to a mile-and-an-eighth. Other notable mares to have won this race are 1995 winner Inside Information who won the event as the Shug McGaughey trained entry with Regal Solution defeating the short favorite and 1994 winner Sky Beauty and US Champion Older Dirt Female Horse. Later that year Inside Information would win the Breeders' Cup Distaff and be crowned US Champion Older Dirt Female Horse. The 1997 winner Hidden Lake would also later that year be voted US Champion Older Dirt Female Horse. Stopchargingmaria, the 2015 was the last Shuvee winner to go on and win the Breeders' Cup Distaff.

The blend of spices and molasses, rolled paper thin, has a reputation as the \\"World's Thinnest Cookie.\\" They are related to German Lebkuchen; original recipes can be traced back to the 17th century. The cookie is especially popular around, and usually associated with, Christmas in communities with a strong Moravian background such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which still maintain the two largest Moravian communities in the United States. Traditionally, prominent homes in the community hosted open houses which contained elaborate Nativity scenes. These scenes were often built around large tree stumps which were found in the woods near the town. People opened their homes for viewings of these scenes, and offering cookies to guests was an important part of the tradition. The spice cookies were central to the occasion, but many families also made a sugar cookie which was made with butter and flavored heavily with nutmeg. Families made their own cookie cutters and handed them down to family members. The shapes were primarily farm animals, as part of the Nativity tradition. Families often had a few cookie cutters which were large and intricate and took real skill to cut out and bake. Although there are a few bakeries that still roll and cut the cookies by hand, some now use a mechanized process for making the cookies in order to meet the demand. While this does not affect the taste, the machine-made cookies have been criticized for not being as thin as their handmade counterparts. While the spice recipe is the most traditional and well-known of the Moravian cookies, other versions have appeared over the years, including sugar, lemon, black walnut, and chocolate varieties.

It was later supported by the Seckford Foundation. Woodbridge School has been co-educational since September 1974. History The school was founded in 1577; however, like so many others, it lapsed during the Civil War. In 1662 Robert Marryott, known as ‘the great eater’, hosted a feast for local worthies in Woodbridge which started at the Crown Hotel and finished at the King’s Head in Woodbridge. From this feast came the reincarnation of the school which today enjoys the curious claim of being the only independent school in the country to have been founded in two public houses. The Free School, Woodbridge, was an expression of the new confidence in England following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Local citizens contributed to the founding of the school in 1662, appointing a schoolmaster on an annual salary of £25 to teach, without charge, ten ‘sons of the meaner sort of the inhabitants of the town’.Woodbridge School History Additional pupils paid an annual fee of £1. After a difficult start, including the ravages of the plague in 1666, the School flourished and enjoyed a glorious era in the eighteenth century when the East Anglian gentry enrolled their sons in great numbers. By the mid-nineteenth century, the cramped School building was proving inadequate and in 1861 the school integrated with the Seckford Trust, an almshouse charity, becoming a part beneficiary of an endowment left to the town of Woodbridge in 1587 by Thomas Seckford, Master of the Court of Requests to Queen Elizabeth I. In 1864 the school moved from the centre of town to its present site with of wooded grounds overlooking Woodbridge on the site of the former Augustine Woodbridge Priory.The Abbey (now Woodbridge School Prep), Woodbridge, British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 2011-05-01. In 1974 the school became fully co-educational and today has 725 pupils. The school The school is a co-educational day school with a boarding component.

He was often considered the greatest Portuguese painter of his generation. Early life and career (1940s and 1950s) Pomar first studied at the Escola Secundária Artística António Arroio, in his native city of Lisbon. He entered the Superior School of Fine Arts of Lisbon in 1942. The same year he organized his first exhibition, with a group of former colleagues of the António Arroio School, aged only 16 years old, which included painters like Fernando de Azevedo and Marcelino Vespeira. Among the notables that visited it was Almada Negreiros, who bought him the now lost painting Saltimbancos. In 1944, disappointed with the Lisbon artistic education, he moved to the Superior School of Fine Arts of Porto, which he would leave two years later, after a disciplinary process. During this time he joined a group of fellow artists called the Independents and participated in their exhibitions in 1944, in Porto and Coimbra, and in 1945, in Lisbon. He was the director of the art page of the daily A Tarde, from Porto, from June to October 1945. He helped to divulgate the work of painters like the German Expressionist George Grosz, the Mexican muralists José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Brazilian Candido Portinari, three leading names of the Neo-realism artistic movement. He soon was a member of the artistic movement in Portugal, and would collaborate in magazines like Seara Nova, Vértice and Mundo Literário. He joined the Communist Youth of the Portuguese Communist Party in 1945, of which he would gradually leave years later.Alexandre Pomar, Júlio Pomar. O neo- realismo, e depois (1942-1968), in Pomar, Júlio - Júlio Pomar, Catálogo \\"Raisonné\\". Paris; Lisboa: I Éditions de la Différence; Ed. Artemágica (2004) (Portuguese). Pomar work becomes very politically and ideological engaged during his neo-realist phase, from 1945 to 1957. In 1946, he started a mural at the Cine Teatro Batalha, in Porto, which would be destroyed for political reasons in 1948. He was one of the main organizers and exhibiters of the General Exhibitions of Plastic Arts, from 1946 to 1956, that were the main exhibitions of Portuguese neo-realist painting during this time. One of his paintings, Resistência (Resistance) was apprehended by the Political Police in 1947, at the second exhibition, deemed as \\"political subversive\\". The same year he held his first individual exhibition at the Portugália Gallery, in Porto. He also would be arrested for four months, for being a member of the MUD. He did the official portrait of Democratic Opposition Presidential candidate, general José Norton de Matos, in 1948. In 1949, he lost his place of Drawing teacher at the technical education because of his political involvement in the campaign. Pomar first truly neo-realist painting was Gadanheiro (Mower), from 1945, while his most emblematic work in this style would be O Almoço do Trolha (The Lunch of the Trolley), where he worked from 1946 to 1950, and was first exhibited in 1947. Portuguese art historian Rui Mário Gonçalves described it as one of \\"the most important milestones of Neo- realist painting, with its theme taken from the life of the proletariat, treated with rough material and with a Portinariesque anatomical accentuation of the feet and hands\\".Rui Mário Gonçalves, Pintura e Escultura em Portugal. 1940-1980 (1981) (Portuguese) During these youth years, he also worked on illustration and ceramics. He became less compromised with time with the neo- realist movement and his last important works in this style were the paintings that he did called Ciclo do Arroz (Rice Cicle), from 1952-1955, inspired by several travels to Ribatejo's rice fields in the company of writer Alves Redol. Like art historian Alexandre Pomar explained, \\"Around 1956, without a precise point of rupture in its pictorial production or an explicit departure from the previous political positions, the itinerary of Pomar begins to be oriented in other directions\\".Alexandre Pomar, Júlio Pomar. O neo-realismo, e depois (1942-1968), in Pomar, Júlio - Júlio Pomar, Catálogo \\"Raisonné\\". Paris; Lisboa: I Éditions de la Diference; Ed. Artemágica (2004) (Portuguese) After 1960 Pomar had already left neo-realism when he settled in Paris in June 1963. He would return several times to Portugal for the next twenty years. In Paris, he will not join any artistic groups nor practice the artistic languages in vogue, maintaining a position of critical distance to the contemporary arts movements. This defense of autonomy leads him to remain faithful to the expression of the gesture, to the exploration of the line, to the opening of composition to an informal pictorial language. In 1967 he made the first assemblages with found materials and in the following year he began two parallel series, one of which was about the convulsions of May 1968. He exhibited once again in Lisbon and, beginning in 1969, he began a regular collaboration with the Gallery 111 of Manuel de Brito, who from now on would represent him in Portugal. When the revolution of April 1974 occurs Pomar is in Lisbon, where he remains for several months. Throughout the 1970s he published a collection of poems, participated in important international exhibitions, most notably at the Bienal de S. Paulo, Brazil, in 1976, and held important solo exhibitions, from which one can highlight the first retrospective of his work, at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, in Lisbon, and at the Soares dos Reis National Museum, in Porto, both in 1978. Characterized by a type of figuration that crosses the surprise of the process of association of images learned with surrealism and the heritage of abstract expressionism, the painting of Pomar over the last decades results from an intense activity and a permanent desire for thematic diversification. In their combinations we will find tigers and rain hats, monkeys, portraits, more or less explicit; sometimes it seems clear his will to seek its roots, like in his famous painting Lusitânia no Bairro Alto (1985), with portraits of Mário de Sá Carneiro, Santa-Rita Pintor and Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso. Essays and poetry He published three books of essays on painting, Discours sur la Cécité des Peintres (1985), Da Cegueira dos Pintores (1986), and Então e a Pintura? (2003). He published two books of poetry, Alguns Eventos (1992) and TRATAdoDITOeFeito (2003). Atelier-Museum Júlio Pomar The Atelier-Museum Júlio Pomar was inaugurated in Lisbon, in 2013, in a building bought by the Municipality of Lisbon in 2000, and refurbished in a project by Álvaro Siza Vieira. The Atelier-Museum has several hundreds of works by the artist, including paintings, drawings and sculptures, donated by himself to the Júlio Pomar Foundation.Atelier-Museu Júlio Pomar, Público, 6 February 2013 (Portuguese) Public collections Pomar is represented in several museums across Portugal and abroad, including the Chiado Museum, Modern Art Center José de Azeredo Perdigão, Berardo Collection Museum, in Lisbon, Museum of Contemporary Art of Serralves, Porto, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo Museum of Art, São Paulo, among others.

Life A son of David XI of Kartli, he took refuge in Persia after his father was dislodged by the Ottoman invasion in 1578. He was raised at the shah’s court in Isfahan, brought up Muslim and adopted Persian customs. Later, for his efforts, he was given a fiefdom in mainland Iran. Around the mid 1590s, he assisted Farhad Khan Qaramanlu in arranging a match for Abbas I with a daughter of the Amilakhori noble family. In 1615/1616, he was installed by Abbas I as a puppet king/khan in Kartli on the deposition of his cousin, King Luarsab II the Martyr. He exercised only a limited power confined to Lower Kartli and largely relied on Persian forces. Considered as a renegade, he was disgusted by most of the kingdom’s population and, in spite of the Persian presence, he was unable to control even seemingly loyal nobility. His short reign was spent mostly in the town of Bolnisi, where he died in 1619, to be succeeded by his son, Simon II (Semayun Khan). His half-brother Khosrow was given his land in Iran.

Óscar Dancigers, the producer, asked Buñuel to direct this film after the success of the 1949 film El Gran Calavera. Buñuel already had a script ready titled ¡Mi huerfanito jefe! about a boy who sells lottery tickets. However, Dancigers had in mind a more realistic and serious depiction of children in poverty in Mexico City. After conducting some research, Jesús Camacho and Buñuel came up with a script that Dancigers was pleased with. The film can be seen in the tradition of social realism, although it also contains elements of surrealism present in much of Buñuel's work. Los Olvidados was widely criticized upon its initial release, but earned the Best Director award at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival. It is now considered a masterpiece of Latin American cinema. Plot The film is about a group of destitute children and their misfortunes in a Mexico City slum. El Jaibo escapes juvenile jail and reunites with the street gang that he leads. They attempt to rob a blind street musician and, failing at first, later track him down, beat him, and destroy his instruments. With the help of Pedro, El Jaibo tracks down Julián, the youngster who supposedly sent him to jail. El Jaibo puts his unharmed arm in a sling, hides a rock in it and confronts Julián, who denies that he reported him to the police and refuses to fight El Jaibo because it wouldn't be a fair fight. As Julián starts to walk away, El Jaibo hits him in the back of the head with the rock. He then beats Julián heavily with a stick and takes his money, killing him. El Jaibo warns Pedro not to report the crime and shares Julián's money with Pedro to make him an accomplice. Pedro's mother resents her son's behavior, and shows that she doesn't love or care for him. Pedro is saddened by this, vows to start behaving better and finds work as apprentice to a blacksmith. One day, El Jaibo comes to talk with him about their secret and, unbeknownst to Pedro, steals a customer's knife from the blacksmith's table. Pedro is accused of the crime and sent to a juvenile rehabilitation program, the \\"farm school,\\" where he gets into a fight and kills two chickens. The principal tests Pedro by handing Pedro a 50 pesos bill to run errands with. Pedro accepts and leaves with the intention to complete the errands. As soon as he leaves, he encounters El Jaibo, who steals the money. Upset that his attempt to be good was foiled again, Pedro tracks down El Jaibo and fights him. The fight ends in a stalemate, but Pedro announces to the crowd that it was El Jaibo who killed Julián. El Jaibo flees, but the blind man has heard the accusation and tells the police. Pedro tracks El Jaibo down once again to murder him. El Jaibo kills Pedro. While fleeing, El Jaibo encounters the police and, as he tries to run away, the police shoot and kill him. Meche and her grandfather find Pedro's body in their shed. Not wanting to get involved, they dump his body down a garbage-covered cliff. On their way, they pass Pedro's mother, who, though once unconcerned with her disobedient child, is now searching for him.  Alternate ending  In 2002, it was announced that an alternate ending for Los Olvidados (labeled \\"the happy ending\\") was discovered at the Film Warehouse of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and it would be restored digitally in order to show it to the public. On July 8, 2005, it was re-screened with the alternate ending in a few selected venues and included in subsequent DVD releases. At the International Cinematographic Festival in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, on February 3, 2011, the last surviving member of the cast, Alfonso Mejía (Pedro), introduced the alternative ending to the film. The alternative ending begins with El Jaibo and Pedro fighting in an abandoned warehouse. Pedro pushes El Jaibo from the roof, where he falls to his death. Pedro frisks the body for the money El Jaibo stole from him (in contrast to the original ending, where Pedro is murdered by El Jaibo). Pedro returns to the farm school with the money that the principal entrusted to him.

Both films deal with the never- ending cycle of poverty and despair. Los Olvidados is especially interesting because although “Buñuel employed … elements of Italian neorealism,” a concurrent movement across the Atlantic Ocean marked by “outdoor locations, nonprofessional actors, low budget productions, and a focus on the working classes,” Los Olvidados is not a neorealist film (Fernandez, 42). “Neorealist reality is incomplete, conventional, and above all rational,” Buñuel wrote in a 1953 essay titled \\"Poetry and Cinema.\\" “The poetry, the mystery, all that completes and enlarges tangible reality is utterly lacking.” (Sklar, 324) Los Olvidados contains such surrealistic shots as when “a boy throws an egg at the camera lens, where it shatters and drips” or a scene in which a boy has a dream in slow-motion (Sklar, 324). The surrealist dream sequence was actually shot in reverse and switched in post-production. Buñuel does not romanticize the characters, and even the abused blind man is revealed to have cruel habits of preying on children and selling fake elixirs.  Controversy about possible plagiarism  Journalist Verónica Calderón, in an article published on August 14, 2010 in the Spanish newspaper El País, collects statements by Morelia Guerrero, daughter of Mexican journalist and writer Jesús R. Guerrero (Numarán, Michoacán, 1911-1979), in which Morelia points out that the script and the film are based on a novel written by her father, entitled Los Olvidados, published in 1944, with a prologue by Mexican writer José Revueltas. The National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (IPN) published, in December 2009, a second edition of the novel penned by Jesús R. Guerrero. However, comparative studies have been made between the film and the novel, and no trace of any plagiarism by Buñuel has been found. Reception =Initial= Los Olvidados was largely disparaged by the Mexican press upon its release. Juan Carlos Ibáñez and Manuel Palacio write, \\"The film was so harsh and innovative, so critical and daring in its statements that during its first screenings, spectators openly aired their indignation towards the features of Mexican identity presented by Buñuel.\\" The work was also criticized as overly bleak. =Retrospective= Many critics have since proclaimed Los Olvidados a masterpiece. It currently holds a 90% score on the website Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews. It was inscribed on UNESCO's \\"Memory of the World\\" Register in 2003 in recognition of its historical significance.Los olvidados The work placed 110th in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made. In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Influence Los Olvidados has been cited as an influence on films such as Pixote (1980), Amores perros (2000), and City of God (2002).

As the culmination of the type in German service, she represented significant improvements over earlier vessels, particularly the and es, which had been disappointments in service. She was intended to serve as a fleet scout and as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats. Hela marked a step toward the development of the light cruiser. Armed with a battery of four guns and three torpedo tubes, the ship proved to be too weakly-armed for front-line combat. Hela had a relatively short active career; engine damage during sea trials shortly after her completion in 1896 delayed the start of her service with the fleet until 1898. She served as a scout for I Squadron from then until 1900, when she was deployed as part of an expeditionary force to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China. Hela saw little action during the deployment, instead frequently patrolling the coast of China and the Yangtze river. After returning to Germany in mid-1901, she served with I Scouting Group and the main fleet until late 1902, when she was reduced to a gunnery training ship, though boiler problems forced a more thorough reconstruction that lasted from 1903 to 1910. The ship was used as a tender for the fleet from October 1910 through mid-1914, with few events of note for Hela during this period. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Hela was deployed to the patrol line guarding the German Bight. She was present at, but was not engaged in, the Battle of Helgoland Bight in August. The next month, while conducting training off Helgoland, she was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine . Despite the fact that Hela sank in less than half an hour, all of her crew, save two men, were rescued by a German U-boat and patrol boat. Design Hela, named for the schooner of 1852-vintage, was the culmination in the development of the aviso type in the German fleet. The avisos were developed from earlier torpedo boats and were intended for use in home waters with the fleet, both as flotilla leaders to direct groups of torpedo boats and as scouts for the fleet's capital ships. The first aviso, , was purchased from a British shipbuilder in 1875; seven more ships were built in German yards by the early 1890s. Of these, the last four vessels, comprising the and es, had proved to be significant disappointments in service, owing to their poor seaworthiness and insufficient speed. In 1893, the naval construction staff prepared a design for a new vessel, designated \\"H\\", which remedied the problems of the earlier vessels, in part through a significant increase in size. The aviso type culminated in what would later be referred to as the light cruiser; German designers incorporated the best aspects of Helas design with those of their contemporary unprotected cruisers, resulting in the s, which were the first true light cruisers built. =General characteristics and machinery= Hela early in her career Hela was long at the waterline and overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She was designed to displace , and at full load the displacement increased to . Her hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, which contained twenty-two watertight compartments above the armored deck and ten below. A double bottom ran for thirty-five percent of the length of the hull, which had a pronounced ram bow. The ship had a minimal superstructure, with a small conning tower. A raised forecastle deck extended from the stem to the funnel. She was fitted with a pair of light pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Helas crew consisted of 7 officers and 171 enlisted men as completed and later increased to 8 officers and 187 enlisted men. She carried a number of small boats, including one barge, one yawl, and three dinghies. Later in her career, the barge was exchanged for a picket boat. Hela was very seaworthy, but she rolled badly (having a metacentric height of ) and tended to ship a significant amount of water in a head sea, owing to the fact that she was slightly bow-heavy. Steering was controlled by a single rudder; she had average maneuverability. The ship was powered by two 3-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines; each drove a screw propeller that was in diameter. Each engine had its own separate engine room. The engines were supplied with steam by six locomotive boilers split into two boiler rooms, which were ducted into a single funnel amidships. The engines were rated at and a top speed of , though on trials they reached a half knot better. Coal storage amounted to ; range figures for the ship in her original configuration have not survived. Hela was equipped with three electrical generators that produced 36 kilowatts at 67 volts. =Armament and armor= Hela in Kiel in 1899 Hela was armed with four SK L/30In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, \\"SK\\" (Schnellladekanone) denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 calibers, meaning that the gun barrel is 30 times as long as it is in diameter. quick-firing guns in individual mountings. They were carried in MPL C/89 mounts with an elevation range of −10 to 20 degrees; at maximum elevation, the guns could reach targets at . The guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . These guns were provided with a total of 800 rounds, for 200 per gun. Rate of fire was theoretically fourteen shots per minute, but in practice it was limited to ten rounds per minute. She was also equipped with six SK L/40 quick-firing guns, each mounted in individual Torpedobootslafette (Torpedo Boat Mount) C/92. These guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Maximum elevation for the guns was twenty degrees, which provided a range of . Shell storage amounted to 1,500 rounds, or 300 per gun. Her armament was completed with three torpedo tubes. Two were placed on the deck on the broadside and the third was submerged in the bow of the ship. These were supplied with a total of eight torpedoes, which carried a warhead. Their maximum range at 32 knots was ; when set to , their range increased to . Hela was lightly armored. She was protected by an armor deck that was thick and composed of steel. The deck sloped on the sides, and was slightly increased in thickness to to provide a measure of protection against direct fire. An armored coaming that was thick protected the uptakes from the boilers. Her conning tower was armored with thick steel on the sides. She was equipped with cork cofferdams to reduce the ingress of water in the event of hull damage. =Modifications= Hela was modernized in 1903–1910 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. The vessel's internal subdivision was improved with eight additional watertight compartments above the waterline and an extension of the double bottom to cover thirty-nine percent of the hull. As part of the modifications to her hull, both of the broadside torpedo tubes were moved to torpedo rooms below the waterline. She also received eight Marine-type water-tube boilers in place of her old models, and a second funnel was added. The new boilers produced on trials, propelling the ship to the same top speed. Coal storage was increased to , which permitted a cruising radius of at a speed of . Both of her stern 8.8 cm guns were removed and their ammunition allotment was reduced to 156 shells per gun. Her aft superstructure was enlarged to provide additional accommodation space. The ship also received a larger bridge. Service history Hela shortly after entering service Hela was laid down in December 1893 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. She was launched on 28 March 1895 and at the ceremony, Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Victor Valois, the chief of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) christened the ship. She was moved to the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven for final fitting out in January 1896. The ship was commissioned for sea trials on 3 May, initially under the command of Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Johannes Stein, though he was replaced by Kapitänleutnant (KL—Captain Lieutenant) Carl Schönfelder in August. Her initial testing was interrupted by damage to her engines, which necessitated her decommissioning on 19 September for repairs. She spent the next year and a half out of service. Hela was recommissioned on 10 March 1898, under the command of KK Fritz Sommerwerck, and was assigned to I Squadron to serve as its aviso. These duties were interrupted beginning on 14 June when Hela was chosen to escort Kaiser Wilhelm II aboard his yacht Hohenzollern for sailing regattas in Germany and then a cruise to Norwegian waters in July that included a stop in Hardangerfjord. On 31 July, Hela returned to I Squadron before being detached again on 17 September following the conclusion of the annual fleet maneuvers. She again escorted Hohenzollern with Wilhelm II and his wife Augusta Victoria aboard, along with the protected cruiser , for a voyage to the eastern Mediterranean Sea. She returned to her unit on 8 December, after which KK Paul Rampold relieved Sommerwerck. In early 1899, Hela and the rest of I Squadron embarked on a training cruise into the Atlantic. While passing through the English Channel, the ships stopped in Dover, Great Britain, to represent Germany at a celebration for Queen Victoria's 80th birthday on 1 May. In June and July, Hela again escorted Hohenzollern for his summer cruise to Norway; during the fleet maneuvers in August, she operated with the fleet's scouting unit. During the exercises in the Baltic Sea on 28 August, Hela struck the mole outside Neufahrwassar and damaged her starboard propeller. She steamed to Kiel for repairs that were completed by 4 September, allowing her to return to the unit for the rest of the maneuvers. In mid-September, she accompanied Hohenzollern for a cruise to Sweden, and she and the pre-dreadnought battleship escorted the Kaiser's yacht on a visit to Britain that lasted from 17 to 30 November. Hela concluded the year with a training cruise with I Squadron in the Skagerrak in December. =Boxer Rebellion= Hela as originally configured Hela spent the first half of 1900 as she had previous years, conducting training exercises with the fleet. Her routine was interrupted by events in Qing China, where on 20 June, during the Boxer Rebellion, the German ambassador, Clemens von Ketteler, was murdered by Chinese nationalists. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to a creation of an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers, the so-called Eight-Nation Alliance: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the East Asia Squadron, which consisted of the protected cruisers , , Hertha, and , the unprotected cruiser , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units the force numbered some 2,100 men. These men, led by the British Admiral Edward Seymour, attempted to reach Peking but were stopped in the Battle of Tientsin. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. Hela was assigned to the naval expedition on 4 July, which included the four s, sent to China to reinforce the German squadron there. The ships departed Kiel five days later and arrived off the coast of China in late August. Hela entered the mouth of the Yangtze and then patrolled the Yellow Sea through the end of September. She contributed a landing party consisting of four officers and seventy-four men to participate in the assault on Chinese fortifications at the Shanhai Pass. The aviso spent November anchored in the Wusong roadstead, remaining there until mid-December when she returned to the Yangtze. At the end of the month, she was sent to Shanghai. Hela then returned to the Yangtze in January 1901, stopping in Zhenjiang, before returning to Shanghai in February and remaining there into March. At that time, KK Maximilian von Spee arrived to take command of the vessel from Rampold. She later visited the German concession at Tsingtao before returning to Shanghai at the end of May. While there, she received orders to return to Germany, and KK Joachim von Bredow took command of the vessel for the voyage home. On 1 June she and the rest of the expeditionary force departed to return home, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 11 August. =1901–1913= Hela off the Norwegian coast after her modernization After returning from China, Hela immediately participated in the annual fleet maneuvers, serving for the duration with I Scouting Group from 26 August to 19 September. She joined the unit again for a voyage to Oslo, Norway in mid-December, arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on the 16th. Hela returned to service with the main fleet in 1902, and while on a cruise in the Atlantic in May, she was detached to escort the light cruiser , which had been damaged off the Sevenstones Lightship. By this time, the German naval command had decided that Hela was too weakly-armed to be useful as a fleet scout, and so she was sent to the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel on 16 October to be modernized for use as a training ship for light guns. While in the shipyard, Hela passed from Bredow's command to KK Karl Zimmerman's. The work was completed on 21 December and she was recommissioned for this duty on 31 January 1903, but the poor condition of the ship's boilers required further modifications, which were carried out at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig beginning on 25 April. The aviso replaced Hela in her intended role. Some ship location reports in the German archives in the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv (German Federal Military Archive) indicate that Hela was in service with I Scouting Group from June to September 1903, but the naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Röhr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz have been unable to locate any official records of her commissioning or decommissioning during this period, nor of who commanded the vessel during this time. No logbook exists in the archives either. According to the location reports, the vessel was to have ended this period in Wilhelmshaven, but no records follow for the transfer to Danzig, where it is definitively known that the ship was reconstructed. Hildebrand, Röhr, and Steinmetz have nevertheless been unable to determine how the mistake continued for several months, or what ship is actually represented in the reports. Hela remained in the shipyard in Danzig until 1910, where she underwent a significant reconstruction. She was recommissioned on 1 October and conducted a brief set of sea trials from 14 to 18 October. The ship was thereafter employed as a fleet tender. While on maneuvers on the night of 29–30 March 1911, the torpedo boat inadvertently crossed too closely in front of Hela, which struck the torpedo boat with her bow. Neither vessel was seriously damaged in the collision. In April, KK Theodor Püllen became the ship's captain, serving until October. After that year's fleet maneuvers in August and September, the navy conducted a fleet review for the visit of the Austro-Hungarian Marinekommandant (Naval Commander), Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. Hela then carried Montecuccoli to visit Wilhelmshaven and the island of Helgoland. The next two years passed uneventfully; she was transferred to Kiel on 1 April 1912. In September, KK Carl-Wilhelm Weniger took command of the ship. In mid-1913, the Italian Vice Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi visited Germany, and on 31 May, she carried him for a visit to Helgoland, where the fleet was anchored. In September, KK Paul Wolfram relieved Weniger; Wolfram was to be the vessel's last commander. =World War I= Map of the Helgoland Bight Following the start of World War I in July 1914, Hela was brought back to active duty and assigned to IV Scouting Group. The unit was tasked with supporting the German torpedo boats that formed the outer ring of coastal scouting patrols in the German Bight. She was modified slightly between 13 and 16 August, having a third 8.8 cm gun installed. Hela was stationed to the northeast of Helgoland, along with the cruiser . On 28 August, British cruisers and destroyers from the Harwich Force surprised and attacked the German patrol line, resulting in the Battle of Helgoland Bight. Helas commander received reports of the fighting and turned east to reinforce the vessels engaged in the action. While en route, the ship received a contradictory report that stated that the British vessels were retreating, leading now Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) Wolfram to reverse course and return to his assigned location. As a result, she was not engaged in the action. Later that night, she regrouped with the cruisers and to provide cover for the remaining torpedo boats and reestablish the Bight patrol line. Two weeks later, on the morning of 13 September, Hela was attacked six miles southwest of Helgoland by the British submarine under command of the future Admiral Max Horton. Hela was conducting a training exercise at the time; the area around Helgoland was presumed safe from British submarines. After surfacing, E9 spotted the German cruiser and immediately re-submerged to fire two of her torpedoes, one of which struck Helas stern. After 15 minutes, E9 rose to periscope depth to inspect the scene. The British submarine found Hela sinking. Within another 15 minutes, Hela had slipped beneath the waves. Despite the speed with which the ship sank, her entire crew, with the exception of two sailors, were rescued from the sea by the U-boat U-18 and one of the coastal patrol vessels. Hela was the first German ship sunk by a British submarine in the war. As a result of her loss, all German ships conducting training exercises were moved to the Baltic Sea to prevent further such sinkings. One of her 8.8 cm guns was retrieved from the wreck and is now preserved at Fort Kugelbake in Cuxhaven.

They were often known as Bipolars, which referred to the bipolar electric motors they used. Among the most distinctive and powerful electric locomotives of their time, they epitomized the modernization of the Milwaukee Road. They came to symbolize the railroad during their nearly 40 years of use, and remain an enduring image of mainline electrification.  Design In 1917, following the tremendous success of the 1915 electrification of the Mountain Division, the Milwaukee Road decided to proceed with electrifying the Coast Division. As part of this project it ordered five new electric locomotives from General Electric for $200,000 apiece. Their design was radically different from the boxcab locomotives previously provided by General Electric for the initial electrification of the Mountain Division two years earlier. The Milwaukee Road was the only railroad to order this design of locomotive from GE. The most remarkable mechanical improvement was arguably the traction motors used on the new locomotives. They were known as bipolar motors, because each of the locomotive's 12 motors had only two field poles, mounted directly to the locomotive frame beside the axle. The motor armature was mounted directly on the axle, providing an entirely gearless design. This design was almost entirely noiseless, as it eliminated not only gear tooth growl, but also the whine of higher-RPM electric motors typically used in standard nose-mounted applications. The EP-2s were not the first electric locomotives to use bipolar motors, which had first been designed by Asa F. Batchelder for the New York Central S-motors over a decade earlier, but at the time they were the largest. The layout of the bipolars was unusual as well. The locomotive carbody consisted of three sections. A small center section contained a boiler for heating passenger cars, while the larger end sections contained the locomotive's electrical equipment and operator cabs in distinctive round-topped hoods. The locomotive's frame was split into four sections, hinged at the joints, with the two middle sections attached to the end sections of the locomotive body. There were twelve sets of driving wheels, plus a single idler axle at each end, for a 1B-D+D-B1 wheel arrangement. All buffering forces were transmitted through the locomotive frame. The bipolars were designed to be able to pull any Milwaukee Road passenger train singly, and were originally delivered without multiple unit controls. General Electric claimed a top speed of for the locomotives, but the Milwaukee Road rated them at . They were rated at continuous with a continuous tractive effort of and a starting tractive effort of . Service history Milwaukee Road EP-2 \\"Bipolar\\" leaving Seattle, 1925.When the Bipolars were introduced, their modernity and distinctive design made them the most famous of the Milwaukee Road's electric locomotives. They came to symbolize the Olympian, the railroad's premier train from Chicago to Seattle. Their unique appearance and power made them ideal for publicity purposes, and there was a series of demonstrations in which a Bipolar was able to out-pull contemporary steam locomotives. During a short period of testing on the Mountain Division, the EP-2s were shown to be less expensive to operate than the GE and Westinghouse electric locomotives then in use. The five EP-2s, numbered 10250-10254, were placed into regular service in 1919 on the Coast Division. The Milwaukee Road saw immediate cost savings over the steam locomotives previously in use, as the Bipolars could run from Tacoma to Othello without stopping for servicing and could haul trains up grades that had required double-heading steam engines. E-2 on display in 2008 The Bipolars operated on the Coast Division from 1919 to 1953, for most of that period without any serious rebuilding. In 1939 they were renumbered E1-E5. In 1953 all five of the EP-2s, which were 35 years old and worn out from heavy wartime service, were heavily rebuilt by the Milwaukee Road at a cost of about $40,000 per locomotive. The rebuild included additional traction motor shunts for increased speed, roller bearings, multiple unit capability, flash boilers, and streamlining. The E5, rebuilt in the Tacoma Shops as the prototype, performed as advertised, but went over budget, so the Milwaukee Shops were tasked with rebuilding the other four Bipolars. Unfortunately the Milwaukee Shop forces, unaccustomed to working on electric locomotives, did a \\"poor job\\" in the opinion of Electrification Department Head Laurence Wylie. (Wylie's successor, T. B. Kirk, stated that he saw a group of disconnected wires in a newly rebuilt EP-2 bundled together and tagged with a written message, \\"We don't know where these go\\".) Afterwards the Bipolars were prone to electrical fires and failures, despite repeated attempts by Tacoma Shops to correct them. Between 1954 and 1957 the Bipolars saw decreased use, and in mid-1957 were transferred off the Coast Division to the Mountain Division. Their problems persisted; moreover, passenger train speeds in the Rockies (over in some locations) were generally in excess of the Coast's top speed of , further exacerbating these problems. Between 1958 and 1960 all five were gradually retired, by which time they had received the Union Pacific-inspired yellow and gray passenger paint scheme. In 1962 all except for E2 were towed to Seattle and scrapped. Locomotive E2 was donated to the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri in 1962 and moved there that year. It has remained on static display ever since, and has been fully restored to its appearance immediately after its 1953 rebuilding. Side-view drawing with dimensions.

Geoffrey Green was educated at Shrewsbury School, where he played football. He started writing about football for The Times in the 1930s. He is considered to be the godfather of football reporting and the world's first anointed Football Correspondent, although he remained anonymous in the paper until 23 January 1967. He also broadcast on football for BBC Radio. Match of the Century Most noteworthy of his work was covering the Match of the Century on 25 November 1953, wherein the 'Magnificent Magyars' (Hungary) rammed England by 6-3 scoreline under the heading \\"A New Conception of Football\\". It was England's first defeat at Wembley, and the inventors of football were described by him as \\"strangers in a strange world.\\" New Conception referred to the middle ground between \\"the hard hitting, open\\" British method and the \\"more subtle, probing infiltration\\" of the continental game. The best goal of the game was scored by Ferenc Puskas; having received the ball from Czibor on the right near the six-yard box when the England captain Billy Wright went towards him for the tackle, Puskas drew the ball back as Wright charged past \\"like a fire engine going to the wrong fire\\" leaving the Hungarian captain free to score from his powerful left-foot. Many football historians in England believe that it was this defeat that made English football think again, and the seeds of 1966 World Cup victory were sown. \\"English football can be proud of its past. But it must awake to a new future\\". The venerable Times offers this match-report on their site as part of its dedication to the game and for fans worldwide. Green retired from The Times in 1976 after nearly 40 years of distinguished service. Inspired by Manchester United Newspapers were printed out of Manchester until the late 1960s and coincidentally Sir Matt Busby's Manchester United were pioneering the cause to inject youth into football thereby creating a family atmosphere in the stands and no wonder that Green like many of his peers who frequented there, became inspired by their young, precocious team. The chief reason for being captivated was the healthy line of talented young players who came through the Youth Academy at Manchester United - Duncan Edwards, Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best. And it was Geoffrey Green who saw these three popular players in their prime. Reported on perhaps one of the greatest games ever played in the FA Cup where Manchester United beat Aston Villa 6-4 in a 3rd round match '\\"\\"They thought as one man and moved as one at top speed. Here was the sort of football one dreams about . . .\\"\\"' Green was one of a very few journalists to have seen, up close, the phenomenon called Duncan Edwards, to whom he devoted an entire chapter in his book 'Soccer in The Fifties'. \\"His talent, his energy, his unselfconscious fun and enjoyment of the chase, his ability to make everything seem possible, all this added up to a volcano of excitement that gripped the crowds and the game wherever he played\\". Of significance to Manchester United supporters, Green captured the arrival of George Best, too, against Benfica in the 1966 European Cup quarter-final (modern day equivalent of UEFA Champions' League) in a splendid form \\"Night a star was born\\", wherein he described Best's goal as \\"gliding like a dark ghost past three men, to break clear and slide the ball home - a beautiful goal.\\" Quintessential Best as The Beatle who \\"was the best of all, as he set a new almost unexplored beat\\" with his \\"long dark mop of hair, is known in these parts as The Beatle.\\" Books # The Official History of the FA Cup (1949) # History of The Football Association (1953) # Soccer in The Fifties # There's is Only One United (1978) # Pardon me for living (autobiography) References Category:1911 births Category:British association football commentators Category:1990 deaths Category:British sportswriters Category:British male journalists Category:The Times people ","title":"Geoffrey Green"},{"id":"3649587","text":"Special Access Programs (SAPs) in the U.S. Federal Government are security protocols that provide highly classified information with safeguards and access restrictions that exceed those for regular (collateral) classified information.

Types and categories =Types= Two types of SAP exist—acknowledged and unacknowledged. The existence of an acknowledged SAP may be publicly disclosed, but the details of the program remain classified. An unacknowledged SAP (or USAP) is made known only to authorized persons, including members of the appropriate committees of the United States Congress. Waived SAPs are a subset of unacknowledged SAPs in the Department of Defense. These SAPs are exempt by statutory authority of the Secretary of Defense from most reporting requirements and, within the legislative branch, the only persons who are required to be informed of said SAPs are the chairpersons and ranking committee members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, House Appropriations Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee.10 USC 119 Oftentimes, this notification is only oral. =Categories= There are three categories of SAPs within the Department of Defense:AR 380-381, 2004, p. 11 * Acquisition SAPs (AQ-SAPs), which protect the \\"research, development, testing, modification, and evaluation or procurement\\" of new systems; * Intelligence SAPs (IN-SAPs), which protect the \\"planning and execution of especially sensitive intelligence or CI units or operations\\"; * Operations and Support SAPs (OS-SAPs), which protect the \\"planning, execution, and support\\" of sensitive military activities. Only the Director of National Intelligence may create IN-SAPs. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) control systems may be the most well-known intelligence SAPs. The treatment of SCI is singular among SAPs, and it seems there is some disagreement within the government as to whether or not SCI is a SAP. Defense Department sources usually state that it is,32 CFR 154.17 and NISPOM, 2006, p. 9-3-1 and at least one publication refers to a separate SCI-SAP category alongside the three listed above.AR 380-5, 2000, p. 11 The Intelligence Community, drawing on the DNI's statutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods, finds a legal basis for SCI separate from that of SAPs, and consequently consider SCI and SAPs separate instances of the more general controlled access program.DCID 3/29, 1995 Marking SAP documents require special marking to indicate their status. The words SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED, followed by the program nickname or codeword, are placed in the document's banner line. =Abbreviations= Abbreviations may be used for either element. Portion markings use SAR and the program's abbreviation. For example, a secret SAP with the nickname MEDIAN BELL would be marked SECRET//SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED-MEDIAN BELL. Portions would be marked (S//SAR- MB).Authorized Classification and Control Markings Register v1.2, p. 9 =Multiple SAPs= Multiple SAPs are separated by slashes. =Compartments= Compartments within SAPs may be denoted by a hyphen, and are listed alphanumerically. Subcompartments are separated by spaces, and are also listed alphanumerically. Markings do not show the hierarchy beyond the sub- compartment level. Sub-sub-compartments are listed in the same manner as sub- compartments.Intelligence Community Authorized Classification and Control Markings Register and Manual, v5.1, p. 67-68 A more complex banner line with multiple SAPs and subcompartments might read TOP SECRET//SAR-MB/SC-RF 1532-RG A691 D722.For the aforementioned notional MEDIAN BELL program, and the RED FAN 1532 and RED GLUE A691 and D722 sub-compartments of the notional SPACKLE CEILING program. It is possible that A691 is a sub-sub-compartment of D722, or vice versa. =Variations= Older documents used different standard for marking. The banner line might read SECRET//MEDIAN BELL//SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED, and the portion marking would read (S//MB).AR 380-5, 2000, p. 221 Other variations move the special access warning to a second line, which would read MEDIAN BELL Special Control and Access Required (SCAR) Use Only or some other phrase directed by the program security instructions.AR 380-381, 2004, p. 37 Involved individuals SAP access ergo policy on classified security categories de facto is understood informally as described as those who need to know have access, access is \\"on a need to know basis\\".F.A.S. - Intelligence and Security Doctrine published by the Federation of American Scientists [Retrieved 2015-12-13] A SAP can only be initiated, modified, and terminated within their department or agency; the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence; their principal deputies (e.g. the Deputy Secretary of State in DoS and the Deputy Secretary of Defense in DoD); or others designated in writing by the President.Executive Order 13526 These offices are better known as 'classification authorities.'

Three of the members are brothers with the surname Madsen, hence the band's name. Their music combines elements of pop, rock, indie and punk together with lyrics in German. They released their self-titled debut album in 2005 and reached No. 23 on the German music charts. In 2006, they released their second album, Goodbye Logik. Frieden im Krieg was released in 2008 and Labyrinth in 2010. History The Madsen brothers began playing music at an early age. Towards the end of the 1990s, they had already been in two bands: Alice's Gun and Hoerstuatz. One group based itself upon the hard rock genre, while the other experimented with hip hop music and crossover elements. In 2004, the band wanted to further develop their music and lyrics and choose to change their name to Madsen. They sent their demos to Universal Music, which listened and signed Madsen to a contract at the end of 2004. The band played many local and regional shows and became local heroes of a sort in the Wendlands area. After playing before predominately small audiences in 2004, the band – through publicity generated by Universal Music – received the opportunity to play before larger audiences. They have since performed in several open-air music festivals, and have made appearances on MTV and various radio stations. In April and June 2005, Madsen's first two singles appeared, and in May 2005 their self-titled debut album was released. The album peaked at No. 23 on the German Charts and No. 39 on the Austrian Charts. In 2005, the band performed in many German music festivals, including: Rock im Park, Rock am Ring, Highfield, and Hurricane. In June 2006 Madsen performed at the Nova Rock music festival, which has boasted such performers as Audioslave, System of a Down, Green Day, Metallica, and Guns N' Roses. Madsen spent much of late 2005 and early 2006 in the recording studio. In August 2006, they released their second album Goodbye Logik which reached No. 8 on German charts and No. 18 on the Austrian Charts. In March 2008, the third album Frieden im Krieg (Peace in war) was released. They performed at Nova Rock 2009, along with such acts as Metallica, Faith No More and Nine Inch Nails. They played their first concert in the United States on October 16, 2011 as a part of the Goethe Institute's \\"Do Deutsch\\" project. They played their first stop in Boston, Massachusetts.  Music  Madsen's music contains elements of punk and rock, and includes sequences ranging from quiet reflection to passionate displays of emotion. Many fans say the band's lyrics are insightful and well-developed, as they reflect a wide variety of themes and subjects —- including \\"you, me, the world, the sky, hell, heaven, and everything else.\\" Madsen's upbeat songs and passionate vocals are said to be a major factor in their relative success in Germany. Madsen's style of music reminds some of a former popular German group, Tocotronic, and many music critics see the band as a new hope for the German music market.  Political views  While the band hasn't taken any specific positions on political issues, they're known for their anti-racist views. The band members can be seen wearing anti-fascistic T-shirts with slogans such as \\"Nazis Raus\\" (\\"Nazis get out\\"). They also starred in the DVD film \\"Kein Bock auf Nazis\\" (\\"No room for Nazis\\") along with other prominent German bands such as Die Ärzte, ZSK, Beatsteaks and Wir sind Helden.

Dobbie was born in Maybole, Ayrshire. When he was just two-years-old, his parents, Francis Dobbie and Agnes McCreath, died there leaving two young sons, William and his brother James aged six. James remained in Maybole with his maternal grandparents while William was raised in Glasgow by his aunt. Dobbie became a railway employee and moved to York and became a councillor in 1911. He became active in the General Railway Workers' Union, and was its president in 1913, when it became part of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR). During World War I, he served in the British Army and was wounded. After the war he became an alderman of York and in 1923 was elected Lord Mayor of York, the first Labour mayor of the city. He was President of the NUR from 1925–1927 and 1931–1933. Dobbie stood for Parliament without success for Barkston Ash in 1924 and Clitheroe in 1929 before being elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Rotherham in a by-election in 1933. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Dobbie visited the Alcazar, a military academy under siege by Republican troops. Willie Forrest, who arrived in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce requisitioned from a Royalist nobleman said of the occasion, \\"I took William Dobbie, a visiting Labour MP, up a church tower from which you get a wonderful view of the Alcazar's courtyard. There was a machine-gun in the tower and Dobbie couldn't resist the temptation to fire it at the fascists.\\"Mitchell, D.

Plot  Scrooge and his nephews go on a quest in outer space to find an island in space to store his money on. They land on a small asteroid occupied by aliens and (normal) birds. Donald accidentally chases the birds away to a nearby planet, and with them, the only source of food for the aliens is gone. The aliens who were friendly at first are now mad at the Ducks. Huey, Dewey and Louie make Scrooge find a solution for the problem they caused. Scrooge sacrifices his fuel to get the aliens to the tropical planet nearby them.

It is often used in the Quran, notably in a verse that states has been the subject of much discussion. Many classical commentators on the Quran considered that this should be taken metaphorically, as in the sense that God illuminates the world with understanding, rather than literally. The Andalusian scholar Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi categorized nūr into different levels of understanding from the most profound to the most mundane. Shias believe nūr, in the sense of inner esoteric understanding, is inherited through the Imams, who in turn communicate it to the people. Quran The word nūr comes from the same root as the Hebrew aor, the primal light described in the Book of Genesis that was created at the beginning.

In Aramaic the term nūr means fire.https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5135.htm In Aramaic it became associated with ignating candels, shifting the term to the meaning of fire, while nūr became light.https://books.google.de/books?id=Dwx- DwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT175&dq;=aramaic+ner+fire&hl;=de&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj_kfy5w9LqAhWFyqQKHc45AAgQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q;=aramaic%20ner%20fire&f;=false The word nūr, or its derivatives, occurs forty-nine times in the Quran. It is used in reference to God, Muhammad, the Quran, the Book, the Torah, the moon and the faithful men and women. Al-nur is often used in combination with zulumat (darkness) in terms that describe movement from darkness into light, and from ignorance into faith. The word nūr is also used in eight basic referential meanings: #The religion of Islam #Faith #God's commandments and moral laws in the Torah and the Gospels #The light of day #The guiding light that God will give to the faithful on the Day of Resurrection #The commandments and injunctions of the Quran #Justice #The light of the moon The mystical Sura 24 of the Quran contains the Ayat an-Nur, the Verse of Light (Q24:35), which reads, \\"God is the light of the heavens and the earth; the likeness of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp (the lamp in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star) kindled from a Blessed Tree, an olive that is neither of the East nor of the West whose oil well nigh would shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon light; (God guides to His light whom he will.)\\" The phrase \\"light upon light\\" (nurun 'ala nur) in this sura is often used among Muslims to denote the infinite beauty, guidance and light of God. Classical commentaries Most classical commentators other than Sufis took the statement \\"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\\" as a metaphor, and considered that God should not be literally equated with the natural phenomenon of light. Al-Tabari (839–923) in his Jami al-bayan says that the best interpretation is to substitute \\"guide\\" for \\"light\\", as \\"God is the guide of the heavens and the earth\\". Other interpretations make God the source of illumination rather than the light itself, as \\"God lights the heavens and the earth. The Persian scholar Al-Zamakhshari () says that the phrase \\"God is the light\\" is like saying \\"Zayd is generous and munificent\\". This does not mean that Zayd is the properties of generosity and munificence, but that he has these properties. Al-Zamakhshari rejected the possibility of attributes separate from God, such as power or knowledge or light, which would be contrary to the unity of God. He interpreted \\"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\\" as meaning, Al-Ghazali () wrote a treatise on how different types of light should be defined, and how the phrase \\"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\\" should be interpreted. In his view, \\"light\\" can have three different meanings. The first is the ordinary usage, \\"an expression of what can be seen in itself and through which other things can be seen, like the sun\\". In Arabic the word \\"light\\" may also refer to the eye, through which perception takes place, and this may be a more appropriate interpretation. The \\"eye\\" of the intellect is an even more perfect organ of perception, and \\"light\\" may refer to this organ. In this sense \\"light\\" may refer to Muhammad, and to a lesser extent to the other prophets and religious scholars. A third interpretation is that \\"light\\" is the first light (al-nūr al-awwal) and the real light (al-nūr al-ḥaqq) since it is the only light that does not take its luminosity from some other source. God is light, the only light, the universal light, and he is hidden from mortals because he is pure light, although he is omnipresent. Using the term \\"light\\" for any other purpose is metaphor. Another passage of the Quran states \\"The earth will shine with the light of its Lord\\" (Q39:69). Mainstream exegetes take this statement literally. Exegetes of the rationalist Mu'tazila school of theology of the 8th–10th centuries interpreted the word nūr in this passage in the sense of \\"the truth, the Quran and the proof\\" rather than the commonplace meaning of \\"light\\". Shia exegetes take it to mean \\"the land of the soul will shine with the Lord's light of justice and truth during the time of Imam al-Mahdi.\\" Sufi exegetes take nūr in this case to mean \\"justice\\", or take the statement to mean \\"God will create a special light to shine on the Earth\\". Shia belief The adherents of Shia Islam believe that divine guidance continues to reach mankind through the progeny of Muhammad. The Imams have the function of conveying the inner, esoteric understanding to mankind. According to Nadia Eboo Jamal, the Imams are \\"the inheritors of his spiritual knowledge ('ilm), the bearers of the light (nūr) of God and His living proof (hujjah) on earth.\\" According to the fifth Shiite Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, the imams are the muḥaddathūn that are mentioned in the Quran, and are the light of God (nūr Allāh). He was asked to comment on the Quranic verse Q64:8, \\"And believe in Allah and His Messenger and the nūr (light) that We have brought down.\\" He replied that the imams from the Prophet's family were in fact the light of God (nūr Allah) in the heavens and on earth. This spiritual light, passed down from one generation to the next, symbolizes the eternal knowledge that Muhammad passed on to Ali and his descendants. There seem to be two concepts. The nūr muḥammad is passed down through genealogical descent, while the nūr Allah is inherited at the time the previous possessor dies. The imam has the nūr muḥammad at birth, but is silent until he receives the nūr Allah. The nūr muḥammad is the symbol of succession and the substance that connects Adam to Muhammad and Muhammad to the imams. The nūr Allah is the symbol of inspiration and prophecy, which the imams share with the prophets and all men chosen by God. Sufi interpretation To the Sufis, nūr is the first creation of Allah, and all other things and beings were gradually created from it. The Andalusian scholar Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi (1076–1148) elaborated the concept that Muhammad existed before creation. This is the doctrine of An-Nūr al-Muḥammadī, or the Muhammadan Light. The light existed before creation, and everything was created from it. The world is a manifestation of the light, which was incarnated in Adam, the prophets and the Aqṭāb. Ibn al-Arabi wrote, \\"The creation began with nūr Muhammad. The lord brought the nūr from his own heart.\\" The Persian poet and Sufi theoretician Fariduddin Attar () wrote, \\"The origin of the soul is the absolute light, nothing else. That means it was the light of Muhammad, nothing else.\\" To the Sufis, light also represents what we know about our inner self, and darkness what we do not know. Ibn Arabi distinguished three types of light: Nûr al- anwâr (The Light of lights), which reveals the absolute reality in its most transcendent aspect, anwâr al-ma'âni (The Light of the intellect) and anwâr al-tabi'â (The Light of nature). The Persian philosopher Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–91) wrote, \\"Allah's essence is the original creative Light, always illuminating existence. It constantly manifests the universe and energizes it. Allah's Essential Light radiates the whole cosmos in abundant beauty and completeness. To be illuminated by this process means nothing less than salvation.\\" Muḥammad ibn Muṣṭafá Khādimī () writes that, \\"protecting the spiritual heart from worldly thoughts can be accomplished by the spiritual heart's benefiting (receiving \\"Fayd\\" (nūr [light]) from the spiritual heart of the perfect Sufi master. The spiritual luminance (Fayd) flows from one spiritual heart to another by way of love. Death of the perfect spiritual guide or his being in a distant country does not stop the flow of spiritual luminance (Fayd).\\" According to Inayat Khan (1882–1927) the soul is like a ray of the sun. The angels, who do not have physical bodies, are made of nūr, or light, that comes from the divine Sun, the Spirit of God. All souls are made of Nur, or contain some part of that essence, which is the essence of the whole manifestation. Medieval Bengal Hans Harder writes that in medieval Bengali Sufi cosmology the nūr muḥammad is personified. The nūr, created by the lord, in turn brought the world into existence from drops of perspiration (gharma, ghām) that appeared in different parts of his body. He says the concept is common in Maijbhandari writings, often used to describe the saints or their sensual qualities. Gholan Morshed wrote an article that identified nūr with Muhammad. In his Is'lāmī prabandha sambhār he wrote that nūr-i muḥammadī is the moving force behind all creation, and should not be seen as separate from Muhammad. He wrote, Lutfunnesa Hosaini wrote a treatise Tāohīd, part of which discusses the creation of the world from the time when nūr-i muḥammadī emerged to the time when Muhammad was born. She writes that the nūr-i muḥammadī was divided into four parts. From the first three emerged the pen, the book of destinies and the throne. The fourth part was divided into four. From the first three emerged the angels that held the throne, the seat of the throne, and all of the other angels. The last part gave rise to the sky, the earth, heaven and hell, and to a part that then gave the light of the eyes of the believers, the light of their hearts, the light of the tawḥīd and the kalima. Lutfunnesa Hosaini gives another account with reference to a Quranic commentary named Tafsīr-i rūḥ al-kitāb. In this version nūr-i muḥammadī was also used to create the nūr of Adam, stored on his back. The angels gathered behind Adam to see the light. Adam asked the Lord to put the light on his forehead, and the angels came round to where he could see them. Adam wanted to see the light himself, and the Lord transferred it to his index finger. When Adam came down to earth, lights entered his back again, and the nūr was then passed from Adam through the backs of various men and the wombs of women down to the parents of Muhammad. Modern Turkey Said Nursî founded the Nur movement in Turkey, stressing patience and spiritual withdrawal after the secularization program of the 1930s and 1940s had crushed revolt. The adherents of the Nur movement and the Sufi orders in general consider that societal change will be enabled if individuals are redeemed. Negative feelings such as anger and shame should be controlled through inner mobilization. Said Nursî's textually-based Nurcu movement evolved from the Sufi orders. According to the Nurcu leader Mehmet Kırkıncı, \\"the sun of Islam set down in 1925 and dawned in 1950 with the writings of Said, which enlighten the darkness of Kemalism with its light [nur].\\"  See also  *Yaqeen *Baqaa *The five lights a similar concept References Sources     * * Category:Sufi philosophy Category:Islamic theology Category:Light Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Nūr (Islam)"},{"id":"3649650","text":"An ENGO (environmental non-governmental organization) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in the field of environmentalism. These organizations operate both locally and internationally which makes them play an important role in dealing with different kinds of environmental issues that are happening in the contemporary world. One of the most distinguishable things between environmental NGOs and environmental movements is that environmental NGOs have constitutions that state the rules of how power gets distributed among the people who are part of them. From the emergence of environmental NGOs in the 1970s and 1980s, back when people only started to acknowledge the seriousness of environmental issues , many developments have been made towards helping the planet and its inhabitants. Some notable examples of these contributors are WWF, Greenpeace, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, Friends of the Earth, Himalayan Wildlife Foundation and the Environmental Investigation Agency. Classification and Goals To evaluate the classification of environmental NGOs, it is important to consider these five factors : • geopolitical origins (location), • political ideology (left / right / neither support), • size (quantity), • level of political focus (local / regional / international / global), • funding sources (income). Main goals of environmental NGOs include but are not limited to : • creating relationships with the government and other organizations, • offering training and assistance in agricultural conservation to maximize the use of local resources, • establishing environmental solutions, and managing projects implemented to address issues affecting a particular area. To fully understand the social, economic, and environmental effects that the organization can have on a region, it is also important to note that the organization can act outside the formal processes what state governments and other government institutions must comply with. Funding Environmental NGOs are organizations that are not run by federal or state governments, therefore they receive funds from private donors, corporations, and other institutions.Pamela Chasek, ed. 2000 The Global Environment in the Twenty-First Century: Prospects for International Cooperation.United Nations University With political backup, environmental NGOs also receive considerable amounts of assets and resources through government sponsors such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) who supersede environmental policies. The funds issued by various parties inevitably influence the way their efforts will be put out, the different kinds of environmental policy-making, and the activities pursued to challenge and put pressure on the states to cooperate in environmental protection. It is clear that private and non-private funding influences and affects the way environmental NGOs view and report environmental conditions. Approaches The concept of local is also crucial to the kinds of efforts and objectives what environmental NGOs will carry out. This aim is going to aid how environmental NGOs will “facilitate, fund, promote, and provide planning and organizational assistance to so-called grassroots organizations\\". Their efforts come in many forms such as: launching campaigns against nuclear weapons testing, protesting whale hunting, and \\"international campaigns against the degradation of environmental goods caused by practices like \\"clearing of timber, and criticize states for their ineffective policies or transnational corporations for environmentally damaging production\\". Challenges • Environmental NGOs have become increasingly aware of the loss of biodiversity in Africa and operate on conserving wild and domesticated animals and plants. By the 1980s, most of Zimbabwe's best land had been taken control of by European settlers which have been divided into categories of \\"(1) large-scale commercial farmland. (2) resettlement areas, (3) communal lands, (4) national parks and safari areas, (5) forest lands, and (6) urban land\\" which (with the exception of communal land) is owned and operated by the state. Environmental problems there are defined as \\"a change in the physical environment brought about by human interferences which are perceived by people to be unacceptable with respect to a particular set of commonly shared norms\\".Potter, David, ed. 1996 NGOs and Environmental Policies: Asia and Africa.

Schematic representation of the absorption line shape of an electronic excitation. The narrow component at the frequency ω′ is the zero- phonon line and the broader feature is the phonon sideband. In emission, the relative positions of the two components are mirrored about the center of the zero-phonon line at ω′. The zero-phonon line and the phonon sideband jointly constitute the line shape of individual light absorbing and emitting molecules (chromophores) embedded into a transparent solid matrix. When the host matrix contains many chromophores, each will contribute a zero-phonon line and a phonon sideband to the absorption and emission spectra. The spectra originating from a collection of identical chromophores in a matrix is said to be inhomogeneously broadened because each chromophore is surrounded by a somewhat different matrix environment which modifies the energy required for an electronic transition. In an inhomogeneous distribution of chromophores, individual zero-phonon line and phonon sideband positions are therefore shifted and overlapping. Figure 1 shows the typical line shape for electronic transitions of individual chromophores in a solid matrix. The zero-phonon line is located at a frequency ω’ determined by the intrinsic difference in energy levels between ground and excited state as well as by the local environment. The phonon sideband is shifted to a higher frequency in absorption and to a lower frequency in fluorescence. The frequency gap Δ between the zero-phonon line and the peak of the phonon side band is determined by Franck–Condon principles. The distribution of intensity between the zero-phonon line and the phonon side band is strongly dependent on temperature. At room temperature there is enough thermal energy to excite many phonons and the probability of zero-phonon transition is close to zero. For organic chromophores in organic matrices, the probability of a zero-phonon electronic transition only becomes likely below about 40 kelvins, but depends also on the strength of coupling between the chromophore and the host lattice. Energy diagram Figure 2. Energy diagram of an electronic transition with phonon coupling along the configurational coordinate q i, a normal mode of the lattice. The upwards arrows represent absorption without phonons and with three phonons. The downwards arrows represent the symmetric process in emission. Figure 3. Representation of three lattice normal modes (i, j, k) and how their intensities combine at the zero-phonon frequency, but are distributed within the phonon side band due to their different characteristic harmonic oscillator frequencies Ω. The transition between the ground and the excited state is based on the Franck–Condon principle, that the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion in the lattice. The energy transitions can then be symbolized by vertical arrows between the ground and excited state, that is, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates during the transition. Figure 2 is an energy diagram for interpreting absorption and emission with and without phonons in terms of the configurational coordinate qi. The energy transitions originate at the lowest phonon energy level of the electronic states. As represented in the figure, the largest wavefunction overlap (and therefore largest transition probability) occurs when the photon energy is equal to the energy difference between the two electronic states (E1 – E0) plus three quanta of lattice mode i vibrational energy (\\\\hbar \\\\Omega _i). This three-phonon transition is mirrored in emission when the excited state quickly decays to its zero-point lattice vibration level by means of a radiationless process, and from there to the ground state via photon emission. The zero-phonon transition is depicted as having a lower wavefunction overlap and therefore a lower transition probability. In addition to the Franck-Condon assumption, three other approximations are commonly assumed and are implicit in the figures. The first is that each lattice vibrational mode is well described by a quantum harmonic oscillator. This approximation is implied in the parabolic shape of the potential wells of Figure 2, and in the equal energy spacing between phonon energy levels. The second approximation is that only the lowest (zero-point) lattice vibration is excited. This is called the low temperature approximation and means that electronic transitions do not originate from any of the higher phonon levels. The third approximation is that the interaction between the chromophore and the lattice is the same in both the ground and the excited state. Specifically, the harmonic oscillator potential is equal in both states. This approximation, called linear coupling, is represented in Figure 2 by two equally shaped parabolic potentials and by equally spaced phonon energy levels in both the ground and excited states. The strength of the zero-phonon transition arises in the superposition of all of the lattice modes. Each lattice mode m has a characteristic vibrational frequency Ωm which leads to an energy difference between phonons \\\\hbar \\\\Omega _m. When the transition probabilities for all the modes are summed, the zero- phonon transitions always add at the electronic origin (E1 – E0), while the transitions with phonons contribute at a distribution of energies. Figure 3 illustrates the superposition of transition probabilities of several lattice modes. The phonon transition contributions from all lattice modes constitute the phonon sideband. The frequency separation between the maxima of the absorption and fluorescence phonon sidebands is the phonon contribution to the Stokes’ shift. Line shape The shape of the zero-phonon line is Lorentzian with a width determined by the excited state lifetime T10 according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Without the influence of the lattice, the natural line width (full width at half maximum) of the chromophore is γ0 = 1/T10 . The lattice reduces the lifetime of the excited state by introducing radiationless decay mechanisms. At absolute zero the lifetime of the excited state influenced by the lattice is T1. Above absolute zero, thermal motions will introduce random perturbations to the chromophores local environment. These perturbations shift the energy of the electronic transition, introducing a temperature dependent broadening of the line width. The measured width of a single chromophore’s zero phonon line, the homogeneous line width, is then γh(T) ≥ 1/T1 . The line shape of the phonon side band is that of a Poisson distribution as it expresses a discrete number of events, electronic transitions with phonons, during a period of time. At higher temperatures, or when the chromophore interacts strongly with the matrix, the probability of multiphonon is high and the phonon side band approximates a Gaussian distribution. The distribution of intensity between the zero-phonon line and the phonon sideband is characterized by the Debye-Waller factor α. Analogy to the Mössbauer effect The zero-phonon line is an optical analogy to the Mössbauer lines, which originate in the recoil-free emission or absorption of gamma rays from the nuclei of atoms bound in a solid matrix. In the case of the optical zero-phonon line, the position of the chromophore is the physical parameter that may be perturbed, whereas in the gamma transition, the momenta of the atoms may be changed. More technically, the key to the analogy is the symmetry between position and momentum in the Hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Both position and momentum contribute in the same way (quadratically) to the total energy.

It is thus unsurprising that the current (albeit limited) theorizing on the nature of GONGOs primarily highlights their role in undermining liberal democratic values. Goals A GONGO can be created for any sound political or social purpose, however, in reality, it would be functioning as a mechanism of the government to further its domestic political interests and realize its economic and foreign policy objectives. Sometimes, GONGOs are created to solicit international aid, or mitigate specific humanitarian issues.Natalie Steinberg. Background Paper on GONGOs and QUANGOs and Wild NGOs.

A hairless dog is a dog with a genetic disposition for hairlessness and hair loss. There are two known types of genetic hairlessness, a dominant and a recessive type. The dominant type is caused by ectodermal dysplasia as a result of a mutation in the FOXI3 autosomal gene. Dominant genes Dogs with dominant genes for hairlessness can pass their attributes to their offspring in natural conditions, that is, not under the control of humans. Therefore, it is possible that, in some parts of the world, groups of hairless dogs came into existence without human intervention. Later in history, people developed these groups into a recognized breed. Worldwide recognized breeds at this time are the Chinese Crested Dog, the Xoloitzcuintli and the Peruvian Inca Orchid. The Argentine Pila Dog and the Bolivian Hairless Dog are not registered hairless dog breeds. Other breeds that were said to have existed in the past were the Abyssinian Sand Terrier (also known as the African Hairless Dog, Egyptian Hairless Dog and Elephant Dog, the last being a reference to its grey skin) and the Siamese Hairless Dog. This type of genetic structure is said to be homozygous pre-natal lethal for the dominant gene.Oxford Journal of Heredity This means that zygotes with two dominant genes cannot live. Therefore, all dominant-hairless dogs have a heterozygous gene structure. This allows a homozygous recessive type to persist, which is the coated variety. For dogs where hairlessness is a dominant gene, hairless to hairless matings will on average produce 66.6% hairless and 33.3% coated puppies. For hairless to coated matings, there will be an average of 50%/50% coated to hairless ratio, while for coated to coated matings, all puppies will be coatedGenetics part II: Defining and calculating traits The Chinese Crested Dog's coated variety is called a \\"Powderpuff\\" and is a recognized type.

Recessive genes The American Hairless Terrier (AHT) is the only dog breed with a recessive hairless gene. Unlike the hairlessness resulting from dominant genes, the AHT has no dental, skin or other health issues associated with the dominant gene hairless breeds.

He married in 1718 and, because of a strong family friendship with Governor Charles de Beauharnois, he received favorable postings and promotions. His two main postings were Detroit and (near) Fort Wayne. At Fort Wayne, he became heavily involved in the fur trade. He was also involved in trying to settle wars and allegiances amongst various Indian tribes. It would seem that much of his activity in this area pointed to a high level of ineptness. However, the Beauharnois connection stood him in good stead. In 1744, when Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye lost the western commanders position of directing the fur trade while exploring a route to the western sea, the position was granted to Noyelles. However, this was a demanding job and he resigned in 1746. He returned to Montreal and led at least one campaign in the Seven Years' War. Decorated with the cross of Saint Louis in 1749 after a number of letters of commendation by Beauharnois, he returned to France with seven of his eight children and his wife.

Overview  A ḥāl is by nature transient and one should not attempt to prolong it. It results from psychological or spiritual influences which affect the man during his progress towards God. Related concepts are ecstasy (wajd), annihilation (istilam), happiness (bast), despondency (qabd), awakening (sahû), intoxication (sukr), etc. They arise like flashes on the horizon, blinding flashes of lightning which disappear immediately. However, these stages are necessary for the liberating experience of Man; thanks to them he may distinguish the contingent from the consciousness anything, except that which is destined to endure. According to Ibn Arabi, Fanaa (al-fanâ) (extinction) is the apex of the aḥwāl.  Ḥāl in Sufism  Since aḥwāl are considered in Sufism to be gifts from God, there is nothing on the part of human beings that can be done to ensure that they are granted, for man is merely the receiver. Yet, unlike material gifts exchanged among men, man cannot do anything to avoid experiencing these special states. No prerequisites have been determined for man to receive any particular ḥāl since it has been noted that even the unreligious occasionally experience states that have been granted by God. The explanation given for this phenomenon follows from the idea that there is an overabundance of divine grace and, thus, it must necessarily come into contact with nonbelievers at times. Likewise, those that are in the early stages of their spirituality may experience aḥwāl just as much as the more advanced Sufis. When enduring a particular ḥāl, such as that of ecstasy, one must note that only those who have already experienced that state can truly comprehend what it is like. As well, for the one experiencing a state of ecstasy to be understood, only those that are in a similar state will understand what is being said. This also applies to one’s work, since someone who is viewing a piece of art or reading a particular passage must be in the same ḥāl as the creator was at the time of work’s creation. Failing to do this will only result in a lack of understanding between the creator and his audience. It is generally thought that aḥwāl are only experienced intermittently for a short time, but others such as Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri argue that each state is continuous, and that there is a necessary succession from one state to the other. For him, once a state has been granted by God, man maintains that state, or condition, until he has been given a new state that is spiritually higher than the previous. Others would argue that his definition of a state actually pertains to a station or spiritual stage (maqām) which is a completely separate notion in Sufism as, in contrast to a ḥāl, it is usually not granted by God but only achieved on the basis of individual merit and efforts. His reason for making this claim, however, comes from a hadith given by Muhammad, as well as an explanation of that hadith from Abu Ali ad-Daqqaq. The passage is written as follows: > My heart becomes shrouded, so that I ask God Most High for pardon seventy > times a day. In regard to this hadith, I hears Abu 'Ali ad-Daqqaq, God's > mercy upon him, say: “The prophet (God’s mercy and blessings upon him) was > continually rising in his states. When he rose from one condition (ḥāla) to > a higher one, he might glance at the condition he has risen beyond, and he > would count it as a covering or shroud in relationship to what he had > attained. His states were continually being intensified.\\" Given this passage from Muhammad, it would appear that Qushayrī is correct in making his claim, but many Sufis still consider each state to come and go like a flash of lightning. Still others would claim that while most aḥwāl are short-lived, the more advanced aḥwāl can remain with man for a longer period of time. = Important aḥwāl =  Ḥāl of murāqaba (watching)  This ḥāl is one in which its receiver can experience a feeling of joy or of fear depending on which aspect of God has been revealed to him.  Ḥāl of qurb (nearness)  Experiencing this ḥāl causes one to lose consciousness of his acts, and to concentrate only on the acts of God. The spirits of Awliaa' Allah (Friends of God) are able to give their qurb and suhbat to the seekers of God either while living or dead. Their attention towards the salik (seeker) or student causes the state of estacsy (wajd), but if someone gets control it's better and more fruitful.  Ḥāl of wajd (ecstasy)  A state that is described by its opposites, as the one experiencing it can feel either fear or love, sorrow or joy, or contentment or restlessness.  Ḥāl of sukr (intoxication)  Followed by a ḥāl of ṣahw (sobriety), this state is characterized by an association with God that inhibits man from being fully aware of his surroundings.  Ḥāl of wudd (intimacy)  A state that includes a feeling of awe coupled with content from the divine presence that fills the receiver’s heart. = Other aḥwāl = Additional aḥwāl found in Sufism include: grief, expansion, vexation, contraction, or need.  Distinction from maqām  Generally in Sufism there is a clear distinction between the various aḥwāl given by God and the Sufi term for a stage, maqām. The main difference between the two terms is the idea that a ḥāl is a gift from God, and cannot be sought after, whereas a maqām is only attained through rigorous spiritual practice. In this way, a maqām is something that can be pursued and whose attainment relies heavily on the actions of man. As well, once one has achieved a particular station, they remain in that station until they have moved onto a higher one; thus making it more permanent than the different aḥwāl that man can experience.  Ḥāl outside Sufism  Outside the realm of Sufism, the term ḥāl is used more generally in Arabic and Persian to describe any positive experience of one's soul that transcends reality. In other words, it could be thought of as a state in which man has an unexplained feeling. In this sense such states are not necessarily linked with a divine experience, or encounter, and they are always desired states. = Ḥāl in the Persian arts = As the Persian use of a ḥāl simply constitutes a leaving of one’s normal consciousness, it maintains a great importance when speaking of Persian art, both musically and visually. In fact, it has become so common in among Persian artists that it is now used synonymously with an artist’s ability to achieve authenticity (eṣālat). It is therefore possible for one to make the statement that an artist ‘has ḥāl’, ‘plays with ḥāl’, or even that he is ‘experiencing his own ḥāl.’ Especially in Persian music ḥāl is significant because musicians tend to follow the notion that the harmonies and melodies found in their works are able to bring a listener from one state to another. Reaching certain states also allows the musician himself to perform a piece exactly as it was originally written, either by him or someone else. This idea is heavily based on the Sufi use of the term, though it does not follow it strictly.

Therefore, use-wear studies regularly employ magnification up to 50x, while magnification beyond 50x is relegated to microwear analysis. In addition to the two groups of magnification in which researchers align themselves, a third group examines evidence of use by attempting to identify organic residues present on a lithic. The organic residues are analyzed in order to understand the activities the lithics were used for such as butchering, or other tasks which can leave behind traces of working with wood, ceramics, or plant remains. Tool edge damage and polish are two major sources for information about the use of a tool. Variations of polish type are formed depending on how a tool edge is used functionally, on the type(s) of material, and duration of use. The type of edge damage also varies among different tools. But a distinction is necessary between the intended use, what the tool maker designed the tool for, and actual use. This is an important distinction to note as tools can be used for more than its intended function or designed for several purposes. An often noted example from modern culture are screwdrivers which are designed for driving screws but are regularly used to open cans of paint. This type of multi-purpose tool is noted in lithic assemblages by ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies. Basic edge damage types include step fractures, snap fractures, micro-flake scars, and edge rounding. Fractures are differentiated by looking at both fracture initiation and propagation. Fracture initiation is defined as where and how the fracture of an edge begins. Fracture propagation is defined by the path a crack follows, and the degree of the crack's growth. Fractures are often used to note how tools are created but also used in wear studies. For example, fracturing can help note whether a tool was used in an outward bending action rather than a downward force which can cause a flake to detach and create damage. In addition to flake scars, abrasion, edge rounding, and striations occurring after tool use, one must be careful to note whether this was from actual use or from handling after excavation/collection. Alterations to a tool's edge or surface can result from improper handling or storage. For example, two artifacts within the same bag can cause wear marks from constant interaction, also the bags themselves have been noted to cause wear on artifacts. Experimental archaeology can be employed to test hypotheses on tool function by replicating different activities with freshly made tools. The reliability of experimental archaeology as an information source for use-wear analysis has been tested through multiple blind tests. These tests judge the ability to identify tool motion and contact material. One study done at the University of California Davis found that tool action was correctly identified 84 percent of the time, while tool material was correctly identified 74 percent of the time.Haten, N. \\"The reliability of microscopic use-wear analysis on Monterey chert tools.\\" SCA Proceedings 24 (2010): 1-6. Downloadable from: http://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.24Hanten.pdf The reliability of experimental archaeology has made it a popular method for analyzing use-wear. The reliability of experimental archaeology has made it a popular method for assisting in the analysis of use-wear. With a microscope and proper training, use-wear analysis can be a useful resource. Although experimental analysis of use-wear may be used for its relatively cheap price, it can be a time-consuming endeavor. This may require flint-knapping a tool comparable to the artifact under analysis, which can be long process dependent on personal ability, or buying such a tool. Also, the replication of tool use requires comparable source material (for tool creation) as well as access to the material the tool was used on. Additionally, the experiments must last an acceptable amount of time; slicing an object once will not suffice and requires countless attempts per tool and per material used upon. One example notes how Méry conducted use-wear analysis and experimental archaeology to examine 7 flint blades from a pottery workshop of Nausharo site in Pakistan, which reveals that these blades were used to trim clay on a turning wheel.

The station broadcasts an adult contemporary format branded as 102-9 K-Lite. The station is owned by Bell Media. CKLH's studios are located on Upper Wentworth Street in Hamilton, while its transmitter is located atop the Niagara Escarpment near Burlington. The station received CRTC approval on May 8, 1986,Decision CRTC 86-434 and was launched on October 7, 1986, by Armadale Communications, the owner of CKOC. The \\"LH\\" in the call sign stood for Les Horton, CKOC's first broadcast engineer. Armadale sold the stations to London Communications in 1993.Decision CRTC 93-569 London Communications subsequently sold them to Telemedia in 1999,Decision CRTC 99-172 and Telemedia was itself acquired by Standard Broadcasting in 2002.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-95 In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CKLH. Shortly after Astral acquired the station, CKLH-FM adopted a more adult top 40 format; this ended in November 2009 when the station returned to its adult contemporary status after Boxing Day 2009, and regarding the flip from adult contemporary to adult hits at then-sister CJEZ in Toronto, which became CHBM after that. As of 2016, CKLH plays Christmas music beginning in the last week of November up until Boxing Day. Sister station CHRE-FM in St. Catharines (also with an adult contemporary format using the EZ Rock brand) also begins playing Christmas music around the same time. Most recently, CKLH has begun to skew towards a younger-leaning direction, like its EZ Rock sisters owned that were owned by Astral (now owned by Bell Media). Though the station added more adult top 40 songs, they remain adult contemporary because this station was the only AC owned by Astral Media in the GTA because of sister station CHRE-FM being blocked by CHRY-FM due to adjacent channel interference. In addition, it still reports on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS panels as a Canadian AC station. Most of the classic hits were moved to sister oldies station CKOC and then-sister adult hits station CHBM- FM. Even though CKLH-FM is the only AC station in Hamilton, other nearby AC stations are Toronto's CHFI-FM, St. Catharines' CHRE-FM (also owned by Bell), Kitchener's CHYM-FM and Brantford's CKPC-FM. Currently, only Vancouver's (CHQM-FM), Calgary's (CHFM-FM), (which shifted to adult top 40, but reverted to AC in December 2017) Edmonton's (CKEA-FM) (which has shifted to classic hits) and Winnipeg's (CKY-FM) are served by only one AC station in terms of top-10 Canadian markets. With the merger of Astral Media and Bell Media, CKLH became a Bell Media owned station on July 5, 2013.

Biography At the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, López Ochoa was designated capitán general of Catalonia by Francesc Macià. He led troops to crush the insurrection in Asturias in October 1934, after which the leader of the nascent Popular Front was jailed. The left felt betrayed, and began to regard López Ochoa as a rightist. His left-wing enemies nicknamed him \\"el verdugo de Asturias\\" (\\"the butcher of Asturias\\"). At the same time, those on the right distrusted him for his Freemasonry, for having entered negotiations with the Asturian miners, and for punishing soldiers guilty of violent excesses.Preston, Paul.

Early life  20 Charlotte Square He was born on 21 October 1863, in Shediac, New Brunswick, the son of James Webster. Webster was educated at Mount Allison College where he matriculated in 1878 and obtained a general Bachelor of Arts degree in 1882. After graduating, in 1883 he went to Scotland where he began medical studies at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MB ChB in 1888. He then did further postgraduate studies in both Leipzig and Berlin. From 1884 he was working as an obstetrician at Minto House School of Medicine on Chambers Street in Edinburgh. He obtained his doctorate (MD) in 1891 Enormously successful, by 1895 he was living at 20 Charlotte Square, one of the most exclusive addresses in Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1895 This huge house was previously home to Sir John Batty Tuke.edinburgh Post Office directory 1890 In 1893 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In January 1896 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Alexander Russell Simpson, Sir William Turner, Sir Andrew Douglas Maclagan and Sir John Batty Tuke. Later Life = Medical = In 1896, after thirteen years absence, he returned to Canada in 1896 and settled in Montreal where he was appointed Lecturer in Gynecology at McGill University and Assistant Gynecologist to the Royal Victoria Hospital. In Montreal, Webster assisted with the formation of the Jubilee Nursing Scheme, which later became the Victorian Order of Nurses . Three years later, in 1899, he moved to Chicago where he had accepted the Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Rush Medical College when it was affiliated with the University of Chicago. He also worked at various hospitals in Chicago, including Presbyterian Hospital, the Central Free Dispensary, and St Anthony's hospital. He also contributed to various medical journals and was one of the Editors-in-Chief of Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics. He was married to Alice Kussler Lusk, (1880–1953) of New York the same year he moved to Chicago. She was the daughter of a well known New York physician named Dr. William Lusk. The couple would have three children. Webster became well known for his pioneering work in obstetrics and gynecology in Chicago, and soon rose to the position of Head of the Department. The Baldy-Webster Operation is named after him: Webster first described the method of treating retrodisplacement of the uterus in 1901 and James Montgomery Baldy modified it in 1903.Baldy-Webster Operation at whonamedit.com The operation involved shortening the round ligaments, or Ligamenta rotunda. He also published an important text on women's diseases in 1907. = History = Webster's home in Shediac, New Brunswick. It was recently an inn, but is now again a private residence. Webster retired from medicine in 1919 and returned to Shediac. There, he began work to record and popularize the history of New Brunswick. History had been a lifelong interest, and he was now able to devote his entire energies to the task. As a doctor, he had obtained the wealth and resources that enabled him to acquire important historical documents which had not yet been deposited in museums. Most of these documents would later be donated to the New Brunswick Museum, Saint John, but before then, he would use them to produce an important body of literature on the history of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and early Acadia (see list below). He was assisted by his wife in his work. For example, she translated various French language documents from the Acadian period, a difficult task given the archaic form of the language. A remarkable woman in her own right, Alice Webster was an important collector of art. She founded the Fine Arts Department of the New Brunswick Museum, created an endowment for the collection, and donated her own collection of regional and Asian art. She and Webster also acquired one of the most important artwork treasures in Canada, which portrays the death of James Wolfe in 1759, by James Barry and is on exhibition at the New Brunswick Museum.A National Treasure: Death of General Wolfe, 1776, New Brunswick Museum Webster became a Trustee of the Public Archives of Nova Scotia, a Member of the Historic and Monuments Board of Canada, and the Honorary Curator of Fort Beausejour Museum, for which he was responsible. Apart from his writings which remain definitive sources on many subjects, it was with the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada that he perhaps had his most lasting influence. Working with other members of the board, he surveyed the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island and made recommendations for the commemoration of dozens of sites throughout New Brunswick and Nova Scotia with important historical relevance. Among these were:Women and Museums * Fort Gaspareaux * Fort Beauséjour * Fort Anne * Fort Louisbourg Webster was instrumental is preserving Fort Beausejour, even going so far as to purchase the land underlying the fort, which he subsequently donated to the nation. He died in Shediac in 1950. The Webster Mansion was at one time a country inn.  Personal life  Webster married Alice Lusk in 1899. They had three children. The Webster children were in many ways as remarkable as their parents. The eldest son, J. C. Webster, Jr. (1901–1931), contributed to Canadian aviation history before dying at an early age. Daughter Janet married the French artist Camille Roche and lived in Europe. She was incarcerated under the Nazi regime and died in captivity in 1945. Her letters were published by her father in 1945. The youngest son, Dr. William L. Webster (1903–1975), was a physicist and mathematician who worked under Ernest Rutherford and Sir James Chadwick, and he was Secretary to the Manhattan Project. On 16, March 1950, Webster died in Shediac, New Brunswick, aged 86.

He was a writer, businessman, oil pioneer, family man and a veteran of both World War I and II. Early life Prior to enlisting for military service, Arthur left school at age 16 to work in a sawmill in Rusk County, Texas, handling a canthook on the skidway for $1.50 a day. Another early job was pushing a wheelbarrow filled with mortar to help build a brick plant near Garrison, Texas. This job also paid $1.50 a day. This was six-day work, but he had to spend fifty cents a day seven days a week for meals. He then got a job picking cotton for fifty cents per hundred pounds of cotton—with free board. Between his cotton He made enough profit to make a good start toward growing a crop of his own in East Texas. He obtained what schooling he could at various times and places (Farmer). World War I Harvey enlisted in Henderson, Texas in Company \\"F\\" Fifth Texas Infantry and worked in the company office until he left for France in 1918. He was then transferred to the Second Division of the Regular Army where he was assigned to Company M, 9th Infantry (Harvey). He received battle stars at St. Mihiel, Champagne and Meuse-Argonne. Based on his military records he was active from August 5, 1917 until August 18, 1919 and he was promoted from private to Sergeant. The IRS and Oil After his discharge from the Army, he returned to Rusk County and married Elizabeth Gage of Laneville, Texas in 1919. He farmed in Rusk County for a year, but the crop was not successful. His savings were gone so he sold off all his land and paid off all his debts. He took the civil service exam in 1920 and became a railway postal clerk in 1920. Then he was called to Houston, Texas to work as a chief clerk. That position ended in 1923. At this time, he and his wife resided at 706 Smith Street with their daughter, Elizabeth Inez Harvey (born January 15, 1921). This address, 706 Smith Street, is where the Federal building is now located in downtown Houston. From 1923 to 1926, Harvey worked as Chief Clerk in San Antonio, Texas. By 1926, Arthur Harvey had reached the top salary possible as a railway postal clerk. When he had gone as far as he could go in the Post Office, he began working for the Bureau of Internal Revenue Intelligence Unit (Harvey). He handled many fraud investigations for what is now the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service, being stationed in Dallas and Tyler and working throughout the nation. Eventually he would write the manual on what constitutes criminal fraud in tax matters. That manual was still in use many years later (Joyce Neville, July 10, 2006). In 1928 Arthur's wife, Elizabeth Gage, died. Shortly after, he met Sylva Irene Vogelsong of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania in San Francisco, California, where she was working for the IRS. They were married in 1929. In the years that followed they had two children: Arthur Herbert Harvey in 1931 and Sylva Anne Harvey in 1933. Around this same time, while still working for the IRS, Arthur began to learn something about the oil business by auditing some oil men. After intense study (the oil business was new at the time), he had a chance to make an investment in a percentage of royalty on 35.88 acres of real estate that soon became famous as the East Texas Oil Field, home of Spindletop and other historic gushers. With the money he had saved from oil royalties plus money earned when he continued to work for the BIR/IRS, he was able to drill his own well in 1939. He chose Marion County, Illinois, for his first operation, which resulted in the discovery of the Tonti oil field in 1939. This field has produced several million barrels of oil. Since Mr. Harvey owned the center of this field, the \\"Tex\\" Harvey Oil Company was set up to handle its development. It was later sold. He took many chances and came up dry on nine different ventures until the tenth, which he drilled in Anderson County, Texas in 1941. This latest drilling brought on the discovery of the East Long Lake field, all of which was now owned by the Harvey Company. In 1948, he began drilling wells in Midland, Texas. Although he knew that little oil had been found in Midland, he took a chance anyway. He drilled down 12,000 feet to a stratum in which oil had been found elsewhere in Texas. The hole was dry. Then Harvey wondered what he might have missed on the way down. Working his way back, he got a little oil. Finally, in the fine-grained hard packed sands of the Spraberry Trend at 8,000 feet, Harvey found oil in commercial quantities. Unlike the usual successful well that gushes from the beginning, Harvey had to pump his well to get it started [Time Magazine, family research]. As his output rose from 60 to 120 barrels a day, the rush began. As of 2007, the Spraberry Trend was the biggest oil \\"play\\" in the U.S. with 522 Spraberry wells completed, including 23 wells owned by Harvey. In total, Arthur Harvey discovered the following oil fields: Tonti Field, Marion, Illinois; East Long Lake Field, Anderson, County, Texas; Angus Oil Field in Navarro County, Texas; Tex Harvey Oil Field in Midland and Glasscock Counties, Texas, and Arthur Harvey (Wilcox) Field in Washington County, Texas. World War II Arthur Harvey volunteered again for military service in World War II and was commissioned a captain in the Army Air Forces. He was sent to Italy as intelligence Officer (S2) for the 449th Bombardment Group (Heavy). This unit conducted strategic bombings in Northern Italy, Southern France, Yugoslavia, and other areas. The group was given a unit citation for its attack on the Ploieşti oil fields in Romania, vital to the Nazis. He retired as a major. Later life After Major Harvey returned to the United States, he resumed active management of the \\"Tex\\" Harvey Oil Company, of which he was president and sole owner. He published the book Creed of an American Business Man. In 1948 he purchased the Frederick W. Bonfils home in Arapahoe County, Colorado, along with 320 acres, for just over $158,000. Two years later, he purchased another 160 acres in what is now the Lakeridge subdivision for $80,000. A few years later, Harvey decided to sell most of his land. He joined Aksel Nielsen of Mortgage Investments Company and planned a community of 1,662 homes to be called Harvey Park. He sold 318 acres for #30,000,000, keeping 2 acres and his home. The new owner petitioned Denver, Colorado for annexation in March 1953 (Catlett). In 1962 Harvey sold his mansion, liquidated his Denver businesses and moved to Dallas, Texas. Mr. Harvey retired in 1967 and moved to Corpus Christi, Texas with his wife. He died on March 22, 1976 and was buried in Ft. Logan National Cemetery in Denver, Colorado (Section Q site 7142). Sylva Harvey returned to Denver, where she lived until her death on February 6, 1996 at age 100. She was buried next to her husband in Ft. Logan National Cemetery.

The river drains a largely agricultural area from Llandegfan to Llansadwrn and beyond, with feeder tributaries extending up towards Pentraeth forest. Within the catchment are some artificial fishing ponds and a number of beef and dairy farms. More notable are the remains and ruins of a number of water mills, especially in the lower section before the river enters the strait. Up until the end of the 18th century it appears that great efforts were made to extract all the energy from the river to grind corn. This reflects the history of Anglesey as the bread-basket of Wales. Cadnant Dingle The lower section known as Cadnant Dingle is a steep sided densely wooded valley with very restricted access. It is a designated SSSI as a representative example of the Brachypodium sylvaticum, Oak / Ash (slender falsebrome oak/ash) group of broadleaved woodlands. At the mouth of the river there is a small group of houses called Cwm Cadnant below which is a modern bridge carrying the main road to Beaumaris.

This is the repository of liberating experience in Islam. In relation to the exoteric religious life, certainty is the sister of religious life in its perfection (ehsân), that is, to say the adoration of Allah according to the visionary way; through this channel it is the pillar of Islam in the accomplishment of its external practices, as it is the foundation of faith (iman) in its internal dogma. It is, in fact, ihsân which gives the external religion its true meaning and the domain of faith its real values. It occurs in the Quran about certainty, \\"And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty\\".Quran Surah Al-Hijr ( Verse 99 ) Certainty (yaqeen) comprises three degrees. Stages =Ilm-ul-yaqeen (the knowledge of certainty)= The first degree is referred to by the name ‘ilm-ul-yaqeen (the knowledge of certainty), which means that certainty is the result of knowledge. At this degree the object of certainty is knowledge just as the aim of knowledge is certainty. Both together are in the soul uniquely, such that certainty is the first degree of spiritual life and the last of speculative experience. This particular degree of mystical yaqeen is the result of divine theophanies in act at the level of existence and also the result of theophanies of lights of nature at the gnostic level. =Ayn-ul-yaqeen (the vision of certainty)= The second degree of yaqeen is what one calls in Sufi terms ayn-ul-yaqeen (the vision of certainty), that is, certainty as a consequence of contemplation and vision. At this level, the object of certainty is present in front of the gnostic and is not only a speculative concept. Here knowledge becomes what one calls ilm-e-huzuri’’ (knowledge by Presence), and that is the second aspect of Certainty in the spiritual way and in liberating experience. By this kind of knowledge, the man of the Way is distinguished from philosophers and learned men. This particular degree of spiritual Certainty is the result of divine theophanies of Attributes at the level of existence. =Haqq-ul-yaqeen (the final level of certainty gained through experience)= Finally, the last degree of yaqeen is called haqq-ul- yaqeen (the level of certainty gained through experience), that is, certainty as supreme truth. Here, certainty has a particular coloring: it is the fruit of an all-embracing experience because the object of certainty is identical to the one who is experiencing it, knowledge being transformed into actual experience and actual experience into knowledge. At this stage, in fact, knowledge is not limited to the intellect, nor to the vision of the one who is contemplating it, it becomes one with the human being. This is the final phase of yaqeen, the apotheosis of the spiritual and intellectual journey. This high degree of Sufi certainty is the effect of the Emanation of the divine Theophanies in Essence at its existential level and that of the diffusion of the Light of lights (Dazzling Irradiations) at the level of the theophanies of the gnostic.

The station airs a country music format branded as Pure Country 96.7; prior to May 28, 2019 it was branded Star 96.7. The station was originally launched in 1942 as AM 1340 CHOV by Ottawa Valley Broadcasting. In the late 1940s CHOV moved to AM 1350. In 1961, Ottawa Valley also launched CHOV-TV. Workers at CHOV unionized and labour disputes at the channel led to management closing the station and selling it to new owners. The television station was purchased by J. Conrad Lavigne in 1977, adopting the callsign CHRO and becoming part of the MCTV system in 1980. In 1981, Mid-Canada Communications also purchased the radio station; it subsequently adopted the CHRO callsign as well. In 1990, the MCTV television stations were sold to Baton Broadcasting and the radio stations were sold to Pelmorex. With the TV and radio stations now under different ownership again, the radio station adopted its current CHVR callsign. In 1991, Pelmorex also acquired CKOA in Arnprior and CKOB in Renfrew, both of which were converted to rebroadcasters of CHVR, known as CHVR-1 Renfrew and CHVR-2 Arnprior. CHVR moved to its current frequency in 1996.Decision CRTC 94-933 Due to its signal strength, the Renfrew and Arnprior AM rebroadcasters were both discontinued. Prior to the change, the CBC, known as CBCD, had occupied 96.7 FM in Pembroke and changed to 92.5 FM. The 1350 allocation would relocate to Gatineau, Quebec, where it was used for a local transmitter for Montreal's CIRA-FM from 2009Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-593 to 2015. The station was acquired by Telemedia in 1998, and Telemedia was in turn bought out by Standard Broadcasting in 2002. Star 96 studios in 2014 In 2005 and 2006, Standard Broadcasting carried out a series of downsizing measures at CHVR-FM, eliminating the station's traffic and copy departments (centralizing them at CKQB-FM Ottawa) and downsizing the station's newsroom to one full-time and one part-time staffer. In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CHVR. In July 2013, CHVR-FM was acquired by Bell Media, a subsidiary of Bell Canada (the company which already owns CTV and local CTV Two outlet CHRO-TV) as a result of a buyout of Astral Media. On May 28, 2019, as part of a country-wide format reorganization by Bell, CHVR rebranded as Pure Country 96.7.Bell Media Rebrands 13 Canadian Country Stations As Pure Country Former logos Image:CHVR-FM.png File:CHVR star96.7 logo.png References External links * Star 96 * * Hvr Hvr Hvr Category:Pembroke, Ontario Category:Radio stations established in 1942 Category:1942 establishments in Ontario ","title":"CHVR-FM"},{"id":"3649883","text":"PNL may stand for:  Politics  * National Liberal Party (Romania) * PNL- Brătianu, a defunct Romanian political party known as PNL  Music  * PNL (band), a French rap duo  Other uses  * Pantelleria Airport * Polytechnic of North London, later part of London Metropolitan University * Perceived Noise Level, see EPNdB See also *P&L;, the financial term for Profit & Loss, sometimes written PNL *Profit & Loss, a finance magazine ","title":"PNL"},{"id":"3649894","text":"José Sobral de Almada Negreiros (April 7, 1893 – June 15, 1970) was a Portuguese artist. He was born in the colony of Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe, the son of a Portuguese father, António Lobo de Almada Negreiros, and a Santomean mother, Elvira Freire Sobral. Besides literature and painting, Almada developed ballet choreographies, and worked on tapestry, engraving, murals, caricature, mosaic, azulejo and stained glass. Life and work His mother died in 1896. In 1900 he entered a Jesuit boarding school in Campolide, Lisbon. After the October 1910 republican revolution the school was closed and Almada entered the Escola Internacional, also in Lisbon. In 1913 he had his first individual exhibition, showing 90 drawings. In 1915, along with Fernando Pessoa and Mário de Sá-Carneiro, he published poems and texts in the Orpheu artistic magazine, which would introduce modernist literature and art in Portugal. This same year Almada Negreiros wrote the famous Manifesto Anti- Dantas e por extenso, a humorous attack against a more traditionalist and bourgeois older generation. In 1915 the artist also conceived the O Sonho da Rosa ballet. Negreiros at the 1st Futurist Conference, April 1917 In 1917, with the aim of introducing the Portuguese public to Futuristic aesthetics, Almada Negreiros published, together with Santa-Rita Pintor, the Portugal Futurista magazine, writing the Ultimatum Futurista, às gerações portuguezas do século XX (\\"Futurist ultimatum to the Portuguese generations of the 20th century\\"). He promoted a conference, the Sessão Futurista (\\"Futurist Session\\"), where he appeared wearing a flight suit. Between the years 1918–20 Almada lived in Paris. To support himself, he worked as a dancer and as a factory worker. In 1920 he returned to Lisbon. In 1925 he produced two paintings for one of the most famous cafés in Lisbon, A Brasileira. In 1927 he went to Madrid where he wrote for several Spanish publications, including Cronica and La Farsa. Around this same time he wrote El Uno, tragédia de la Unidad. Back in Portugal, in the following years his artistic production were wide and prolific as he became a key artist in Portuguese modern art, influenced by Cubism and, mainly, by Futurism. His role during António de Oliveira Salazar's authoritarian regime was however ambiguous, acting both as an \\"aligned\\" artist (doing public mural paintings or propaganda posters) and a provocative critic of Portuguese society of the time. In 1934 he married painter Sarah Afonso (May 13, 1899 – December 14, 1983). Re-settled for good in Portugal, he would continue in his role as \\"artistic agitator\\" within the oppressed society that was Portugal until the time of his death. In 1934 the couple had their only son, José Afonso de Almada Negreiros. He was also, if only occasionally, an actor and a dancer, understanding that all forms of art are intimately linked.  Painting and visual arts  Almada Negreiros always called himself a futurist artist, inspired by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and other modern artists; however his style is wider, and does not fit easily into a category. Adding to this modern approach his works also revealed a decorative and arabesque richness, and sometimes a geometrical abstraction. His public art was often politically engaged, as his mural \\"Gare Maritima de Alcantara\\" shows. Many of his paintings and drawings show common people in daily affairs or attitudes usual in socialist art. His work as a visual artist extended to tapestry, printmaking, theater and ballet scenography.  Novels and writings  An important part of his artistic production was literary. Almada Negreiros wrote novels, poems, playwrights, essays and manifests that were, in his lifetime, published in books, magazines, newspapers or even low- cost booklets and flyers. In his novels and playwrights the daily affairs of people appear between a sense of the absurd and non-sense that can be related to earlier writers like Eugène Ionesco or Arthur Adamov. His literary work is highly evolved with his artistic view, often visual and \\"geometric\\" in his descriptions and backgrounds. His manifestos were highly provocative, like \\"Manifesto Anti-Dantas\\", a humorous and aggressive text against Júlio Dantas, a major figure of arts and culture of Salazar's regime, which stands as a banner against mediocrity and conformism. He also wrote essays on the theory of colours, the Portuguese antique painting, geometry and gave numerous conferences on cultural matters.

It stars Fred Penner as a fictionalized version of himself, as well as an array of puppets, musical numbers, and occasional guest stars. Internationally, it aired on Nickelodeon in the United States beginning in 1989, and later on Odyssey Network. The show was positively received by audiences and critics, and won or received nominations for several awards including a Juno Award in 1989 and a Gemini Award in 1994. After the series' cancellation in 1997, Penner admitted to being a \\"little bit lost\\" in the succeeding years as he continued to perform at concerts and give keynote speeches, but was waiting for the \\"next big thing to come along\\". Beginning in the mid-2000s, he began to reconnect with the generation of children that watched Fred Penner's Place as they entered adulthood. He has performed several sold-out concerts at universities and pubs across the country, and receives positive reactions and feelings of nostalgia from the overwhelmingly millennial audiences. Series overview The series was created in the mid-1980s by its eponymous namesake Fred Penner, who viewed it as an opportunity to \\"[provide] an alternative to advertisement-and violence-filled programming\\" for children. The series educates children in different subjects including the teaching of French, one of Canada's official languages. The series is very musical in nature, with Penner playing several musical pieces on his acoustic guitar throughout most episodes. Aside from the variety of puppets that shared the screen with Penner, a number of special guests appeared on the show throughout its run, including Holly Larocque as the character she portrayed on Under the Umbrella Tree, another CBC children's television series that aired during the 1990s. Fred Penner's Place is noted for its distinctive title sequence, featuring a theme song written and performed by Penner himself. The sequence shows Penner walking along a beach and into a forest, observing several wild animals in their natural habitat, and eventually crawling into a hollow log and exiting out the other side, where he introduces himself and greets the viewer. Penner performing on stage in 2012 =Development and production= Fred Penner's Place originated when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was in the process of organizing a replacement series for the long-running children's series The Friendly Giant, which had aired for over 25 years between 1958 and 1985. Dodi Robb, head of CBC Kids at the time, called Penner and told him that the CBC had been watching his career progress over the last several years, and thought he would be ideal as a host for their new television series. When Penner inquired on how the series would be structured, he was asked for his own input, and that is when Penner came up with the idea that resulted in Fred Penner's Place. The series was filmed in both Winnipeg and Vancouver. Originally (and throughout the series' run) a 15-minute program, the show also began adding 30-minute episodes to its production in 1987. The pace of the show has been described as \\"rigorous\\", and due to particular set requirements, Fred Penner's Place's crew had to rush through filming before the set was removed to allow for other productions. They were often given only a month to finish work. In many cases the crew would spend a month writing and shooting in Winnipeg, followed by another month in Vancouver. Executive producer Randy Roberts estimated that the production team's goal was to produce three 15-minute episodes per day. He characterized both Penner and the series crew as working tremendously hard to get through production. Penner called the production an \\"intense process\\" and a \\"complex dance\\", but noted that he relished in it. According to Penner and Roberts, scripts were sometimes rewritten if they didn't \\"strike the right tone\\" for the show, with Penner explaining that a respect of the show's young audience was of paramount importance, and if the storylines became too silly they would be changed to avoid insulting the intelligence of the intended audience. =Music= Fred Penner's Place is most notable for its musical elements, with song performances by Penner being one of the show's most central components. Music director Dave Jandrisch worked closely with Penner; Jandrisch would chart songs, while Penner would often write them the night before a taping, or even on his way to the studio. Jazz musicians including Reg Kelln and Ron Halldorson were also involved with music production on the show. During the 1980s, the show covered many songs from artists going back decades. Penner indicated that because Fred Penner's Place was a children's show, producers \\"didn't have to worry about royalties because it was for a generation that would grow up to appreciate it.\\" However, by the 1990s, Penner began writing more original songs because of growing concerns regarding music royalties. =Cancellation= Fred Penner's Place was abruptly canceled in 1997 shortly after management changes at the Children's and Family Programs division of CBC Television. Although a buyout clause permitted CBC to air the program for a further three years at no cost, they chose not to do so. Reruns of the show were aired until 2000, and the series has never formally been released on any home media to date.

After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of 2. The name of Puyo Puyo Sun comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series ( is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes. Puyo Puyo Sun was also released for the PC. This version was also translated into Korean, so it is the only official translation of the game in any language other than Japanese.  Plot  Satan (Dark Prince in English as heard in Puyo Puyo Tetris) has once again decided to create another test by using special magic to make the Sun bigger on a remote island. This created a semi-resort, in which characters have decided to visit. Arle, together with Carbuncle, find the sun too hot, and see the building that Satan's emanating his own heat wave from. Draco loves the hot weather and appears in a bikini, whereas Schezo, who takes refuge in a cave, finds that it's just not cool enough, and decides to find out what's happening.  Gameplay  Just like the predecessors, Puyo fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise by 90°; if the third column from the left fills up to the top, the game is over. The rule of Sousai and Zenkesei still remained, but every time the player countered, special garbage would fall on the screen in a preset pattern (in the Game Boy version of this game, it fell randomly). Every time player clears the screen however, Sun Puyo would fall on the screen, and the All Clear bonus removed. Note: Ports of this game have music slightly different than the arcade original.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Puyo Puyo Sun on their February 15, 1997 issue as being the fifth most-successful arcade game of the year.

In this episode, Wolfram & Hart C.E.O. Angel and the rest of the group cope with their new, morally ambiguous lifestyle. Their client - an unsavory, violent gangster - threatens to unleash a virus if they fail to keep him out of jail. Biological warfare is averted when Gunn uses the knowledge of the law that Wolfram & Hart mystically bestowed upon him to prevent the gangster from being incarcerated. Plot Angel saves a woman from a vampire in an alley; however, thanks to a tracking device, Wolfram & Hart lawyers surround the scene. Angel is admonished because the dead vampire worked for the firm's clients. At Wolfram & Hart, Fred gets lost en route to her office. Wesley finds her and she tells him that her lab is “giganamous” and she's unsure of the function of most of the machines in it. Her assistant Knox catches up to Fred; Wesley tries to make conversation by asking him how long he's been evil. After Knox leads Fred to her office, Gunn meets up with Wesley, who complains that Fred called her lab assistant “Knoxy”. Gunn admits that though he doesn't belong there, they can turn things around and make them better. Lorne passes by, proving that he's extremely comfortable in this new setting. Meanwhile, Angel's liaison to the Senior Partners introduces herself as Eve; she tosses him an apple to drive home the irony of her name. She points out that if he wants to use Wolfram & Hart's power to do good in L.A., he will have to be prepared to do some bad too, saying, \\"In order to keep this place running, you have to keep it, well, running.\\" Angel responds with a simple bite of the apple. In his office, Gunn encounters Eve, who says that things were a lot simpler when he was just hunting vamps on the street with his gang. She wonders if he's ready for “the next step” and he confirms that he is; she hands him a business card and says, “You’ll feel like a new man.” The next day, Angel is unhappy to learn his new secretary is ditzy vampire Harmony Kendall (last seen on Angel in \\"Disharmony\\" and on Buffy in \\"Crush\\"); she tells him, “I’m strong, I’m quick, I’m incredibly sycophantic - if that means what that guy said - and I type like a superhero…if there was a superhero whose power was typing.” Angel notes that the blood she's brought him tastes good; she tells him that the secret ingredient is otter. Wesley arrives, explaining he picked Harmony from the pool because he thought he would like having someone familiar around. “You turned evil a lot faster than I thought you would,” Angel replies. Harmony's happy to be reunited with the group, especially Cordelia, until Angel breaks the news that Cordelia is in a coma. Harmony brings in client Corbin Fries, on trial for smuggling in girls for prostitution and cheap labor. He readily admits he's guilty; when Angel says he has no incentive to keep him out of jail, Fries says, “Either you get me off, or I drop the bomb.\\" In a conference room, Lorne has each employee sing so he can read them for potential evil. In the science lab, Fred explains Lorne's skills to Knox; Knox tells her that if she wants him to, he'll go up and get read so that she can be sure he's not evil. Fred is still unsure that she'll be capable of running the whole lab. In Angel's office, the gang wonders if the bomb Fries threatened is mystical. Harmony says she has the address for a guy named Spanky, a “freelance mystic” whose name has shown up in Fries’ file. Angel heads to the garage, which houses a fleet of expensive corporate cars, and takes one out to pay Spanky a visit. Spanky reveals he built a mystical container which can hold anything, until the container is dissolved by a magic word. Back in the science lab, Fred and Knox look through Fries’ file and discover he is linked to a cult which specializes in “quick-fire disease scenarios.” When Fred tells him that Fries may be messing with a virus, Angel says that he knows where the bomb is: inside Fries’ son's heart. Meanwhile, Gunn is enduring a stressful procedure at the doctor's office. Back at the firm, Fred tells Wesley that they've had no luck figuring out what virus Fries might be using. Eve pays Angel a visit in his office; she finds it ironic that Angel's dealing with a guy who put a virus in his own son when Angel just lost his son. She reminds him that Connor is happy and he's the only one who remembers him. Angel tells her that he doesn't want her to say Connor's name, and Eve says that if he takes every case this personally, he won't last long. Fred and Knox spend the night looking over files and photos while eating Chinese takeout. Frustrated, Fred accuses her crew of not working hard enough to save people. The next day, Fries’ trial continues; Lorne calls Angel from the trial and says that he thinks they should isolate Matthew (Fries' son); as Agent Hauser listens in, Lorne tells Angel that Fries has no chance of getting off. Hauser tells his agents to go after the kid and anyone within 50 yards of him, and as Angel heads for Matthew's school Harmony tells him that the special ops team are already on their way. However, when the special ops team gases Matthew's classroom, they realize it's empty except for Angel. “So it turns out,” he says, “with this new deal and all, I own a helicopter.” As Fries’ trial heads into final summations, Gunn arrives in a nice suit and gets Keel to cede to him. Gunn moves for a mistrial and announces that the judge should remove herself from the case because according to the judge's tax records, she holds stock in a company owned by a company owned by Fries’. The judge claims not to know about the connection, but Gunn says he discovered it in only six hours. As Angel and the agents fight, Hauser calls him a “pathetic little fairy” who lacks the most powerful thing - conviction. Angel replies that there is something more powerful than that - mercy. He causes Hauser to shoot himself, and to a remaining guard's query about what happened to mercy, he replies that they've seen the last of his. Later, Eve explains to the group that Gunn agreed to let the firm “enhance” him with legal knowledge (and Gilbert and Sullivan for elocution). Angel wonders how Gunn knows for sure that nothing else was done; he said that he was in the White Room and is sure. Eve tells the group that they needed a lawyer, and Gunn had “the most unused potential” - and he just saved the day without using violence. Wesley notes that they did disable the vessel and Gunn says that Fries has to lie low until the trial comes up again, and when it does, he can drag it out for a long time. Fred wonders if they're actually going to do good while they're there, and Angel thinks that they are. He opens an envelope he received earlier and the amulet he brought to Buffy in “Chosen” drops out. The amulet activates and a familiar face, Spike materializes in the office. Production details This episode begins the same way \\"City of\\" - the series premiere of Angel - began: \\"Angel in a dark alley saving a damsel in distress from a vampire,\\" Joss Whedon says. \\"We did this deliberately because we really wanted to call back what the essence of the show was. Angel is the kind of guy who goes into a dark alley, saves the woman, doesn't say what his name is and takes off.\\" However, the new structure of the show means that, as Whedon says, \\"all of his heroism is falling by the wayside and he's a little bit pathetic.\\" Production designer Stuart Blatt says Whedon asked him to build the new Wolfram & Hart large enough so that he could \\"walk all around with a Steadicam and never have to cut\\" then did exactly that; the second scene after the credits is a single, 3 minute, 45 second shot introducing all the main characters in their new setting. According to Whedon's DVD commentary, it took 27 takes to get this one long shot because \\"inevitably one actor is always going to have trouble with their lines, and it's usually going to be the one who's at the end of the take, because that's just my fate,\\" Whedon says.Whedon, Joss. \\"Conviction\\" (Commentary with Joss Whedon), Angel: Season Five on DVD, Twentieth Century Fox, 2004. Set designer Andrew Reeder was pleased to explore a different architectural style from the previous season's Art Deco hotel, saying, \\"it's contemporary, it's sleek... much more about someone like Charles Eames. Simple shapes, proportions, space light and form: it was very Japanese in the approach.\\" In the DVD commentary, Joss Whedon reveals that Alexis Denisof had a case of Bell's Palsy that caused the left side of his face to be paralyzed. Almost all the shots in this episode show Wesley from the right side or a three-quarters right shot. =Arc significance= *Harmony returns as Angel's secretary for the remainder of the season. However, she won't be featured in the opening credits until several episodes later. *Spike is resurrected from the amulet he wore when he closed the Hellmouth in the Buffy series finale. He plays a major role for the rest of the season. *Gunn's mind is enhanced with a comprehensive understanding of the law (and Gilbert & Sullivan, to help improve his voice and diction). He acts as a Wolfram & Hart attorney starting with this episode. =Acting= James Marsters joins the regular cast as of this episode, replacing Charisma Carpenter and Vincent Kartheiser in the opening credits. Creator Joss Whedon explains the decision to bring in Mercedes McNab as Harmony - who has \\"worked for us for as long as I've worked on the show\\" - was because \\"she has been tirelessly funny, and engaging, and sexy, and delightful and it was very nice to bring her into the fold. She was long overdue to get into the mix, and we needed a blond, let's face it.\\" T. J. Thyne, who has a minor role in this and two other episodes as a lawyer, went on to star as Hodgins in Bones alongside David Boreanaz. =Continuity= *Fred suggested vetting the staff to \\"make sure we don't have any die-hard evildoers plotting against us.\\" Ironically, her own assistant, Knox, was doing just that: plotting to use Fred as a vessel for Illyria. =Writing= Joss Whedon, a fan of Law & Order, wrote Gunn's court scene using made-up legal jargon. However, when the scene was sent to a legal consultant they only made a few tweaks. \\"We didn't often know what to do with J.'s character,\\" Whedon confessed. \\"He had a real sense of feeling out of place, so I wanted to show something from J. that people hadn't seen. Plus he looks really good in a suit.\\" Coincidentally, J. August Richards starred three years later in a Law & Order spin-off series titled Conviction.

The episode was written by David Fury and Ben Edlund, with a story from Fury, and directed by James A. Contner, it was originally broadcast on October 8, 2003 on the WB network. Picking up immediately where the previous episode left off, Spike explains he was killed in Sunnydale in the conclusion of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the amulet he wore brought his non-corporeal spirit to Wolfram & Hart. When Angel learns a necromancer named Hainsley is buying corpses from Wolfram & Hart to reanimate with demonic essences, he decides to pay him a visit to tell him that they will no longer supply him with bodies. Spike decides to tag along and is offered a body by Hainsley. Plot Spike, still confused, wonders why the group is now working for Wolfram & Hart. Fred notes that Spike is definitely something mystical, but if he were a ghost, they would not be able to see him, because he lacks ectoplasm. Spike is also generating heat rather than absorbing it. Wesley says that Spike's essence must have somehow been absorbed by the amulet when he combusted while closing the Hellmouth. Angel notes that the amulet was supposedly buried in the Hellmouth, and wonders how it got to Wolfram and Hart. Fred suggests that Spike has some higher purpose and was sent by the Powers That Be, to which Spike thinks that he should have just died in the Hellmouth, since he helped save the world, and that the Powers shouldn't have been allowed to bring him back against his will. Spike suddenly starts to fade, then disappears completely. A minute later, he reappears and blames Angel for everything that has happened, since Angel brought the amulet to Sunnydale (see \\"End of Days\\" and \\"Chosen\\"). Spike suggests that Angel was too weak to use the amulet himself, instead leaving town and abandoning Buffy. Angel argues that Buffy made him leave, and that he had no choice. Spike adds that he doesn't have a choice in what he is now and, despite having a soul, doesn't care about destiny and atonement like Angel does. The others are surprised to learn Spike has a soul, and Wesley asks why Angel didn't mention it. Angel says that it wasn't worth mentioning, causing Spike to suggest Angel doesn't want another souled vampire in the world. Angel responds by saying that Spike isn't even really in the world. Angel heads towards the lobby and is joined by a materializing Spike. Angel denies that he had anything to do with what happened to Spike. Spike calls him a sell-out, noting that one of his perks is that Angel has Spike\\"s \\"ex-tumble, the littlest vampire, fetching coffee\\" for him. He echoes Angel's realization from \\"Home\\" that fighting from inside the belly of the beast might mean the gang is being digested. He says that Angel isn't in control and doesn't know it. He suddenly spots a Grox-lar Beast, which Angel fights; Spike can't fight it because he's non corporeal. Angel breaks the demon's neck, then learns from Harmony that he was supposed to meet with it to negotiate with its clan. Gunn arrives and tells Angel that it might be okay, since Grox-lars respect people who take a \\"strong opening position.\\" He mentions that when Wolfram & Hart gave him law knowledge in \\"Conviction,\\" they put in some knowledge of demon laws from other dimensions. Harmony attempts to chat with Spike, but he ignores her and leaves, prompting her to call him a \\"slayer-loving freak.\\" Angel and Gunn head to Angel's office and discuss the employees Gunn has fired. Spike arrives, noting that the building is huge, and Angel tries to kick him out so he can continue his meeting. Gunn warns that the fired employees are going to fight back, then says that he is going to have to deal with one now. An employee named Novac comes in and asks why Angel shut down the Interment Acquisitions Division (aka grave-robbing). The division is under contract to provide bodies to a necromancer named Magnus Hainsley; Angel tells Novac to get rid of Hainsley as a client. As Novac leaves, Spike tells him that he doesn't have to take that from Angel. Angel kicks him out and Spike says that he doesn't want to spend his afterlife this way anyway. Later, Angel talks with Wesley, telling him that he could be in Spike's position right now. Wolfram & Hart gave him the amulet, so they must have expected him to use it and wind up where Spike is. Wesley notes that they handed over the firm to him and Angel wonders what the Senior Partners are up to. Spike returns and reveals that he tried to leave but something physically kept him inside L.A. Wesley says that that makes sense, since the amulet is Wolfram & Hart's property and Spike is connected to the amulet. Spike is annoyed that he can't leave and Angel is annoyed that Spike is going to keep haunting him. Harmony tells Angel that Novac is back and two men walk in holding buckets full of Novac's remains. Spike smirks and tells the gang they are doing a great job. That night, Angel tells Harmony that he wants to keep quiet about Novac for a little while. Gunn brings him Hainsley's file, announcing that he's a rich sorcerer with shares in Wolfram & Hart and a lot of connections. Angel determines that he's a necromancer; Wesley clarifies that he has power over the dead, which is why Wolfram & Hart was providing him with bodies. Angel returns to his office, where he tries and fails to kick Spike out of his chair. He decides that he's going to respond to Hainsley's bucket message in person despite Wesley's warnings. Before Angel leaves, Gunn gives him something to really hurt Hainsley. Angel heads to the garage and gets into a Dodge Viper; Spike is already there, having guessed that Angel would pick that car. Spike is starting to enjoy the possibility of haunting Angel for eternity since he could drive Angel crazy and Angel wouldn't be able to do anything in response. Angel moves to a different car, but Spike is there, too, wanting to go on a road trip with his old buddy Angel. They drive to Hainsley's house, where Angel tells the butler to interrupt whatever Hainsley is doing. Angel and Spike find Hainsley's showroom, where he poses bodies. Hainsley is in his workshop, chanting over a body as a demon chats nearby. Hainsley puts the demon's essence into the body and is interrupted by the butler, who says that there are men from Wolfram & Hart there to see him. Hainsley tells him to kill them. Back in the showroom, Spike says that the bodies there are lucky, since no one's forced them back into the world against their will. The butler returns with knives (\\"looks like it's buckets for you,\\" Spike tells Angel), but Angel throws a teaspoon with enough force to bury it in the butler's forehead. Spike is disappointed in Angel's method of killing the butler, despite the fact that it did the job. \\"I know you can\\"t help me,\\" Angel says, \\"but could you maybe not root for the other team?\\" They start arguing and Spike says that Angel has all this material stuff, but Spike saved the world and doesn't get anything. Angel replies that unlike Spike, he didn't ask for a soul - he had to spend a century coming to terms with what he'd done, while Spike was fine after a few weeks in a basement. Spike disappears before Angel can finish venting. Angel breaks into Hainsley's workshop; the woman Hainsley put demon essence into tries to leave, but Angel punches her out. He tells Hainsley that he's cutting off his supply of bodies. Hainsley quickly takes control of Angel's body and freezes him. Spike reappears, telling Hainsley to do whatever he wants to Angel. Hainsley tells Angel that he could kill him right now without even using a stake, but he would be insulting the Senior Partners, who seem to have a plan for Angel. Angel calls Gunn and gives him the go-ahead to freeze all of Hainsley's bank accounts and turn over his books to the IRS. Hainsley threatens to sue, but Angel isn't worried. On the way out of the house, Spike taunts Angel for using legal methods to get Hainsley rather than using violence. Spike disappears mid sentence and rematerializes with Hainsley. Hainsley offers to restore Spike to a corporeal body again if Spike does something for him. Spike eagerly asks if the condition is to hurt Angel. Back at Wolfram & Hart, the group begin to discuss Spike. Spike, unnoticed by all but Harmony, returns in time to hear the conversation. Wesley says that the only way to force him to leave the firm is to exorcise him, and that thinks that doing so would be merciful because Spike only has a half-life. Angel doesn't seem to care about mercy, only wanting the whole situation over. Wesley reveals him that the amulet is protected and normally cannot be destroyed, but the magic won't work on in a church or cemetery. Fred objects to the plan, saying it wouldn't be fair to truly kill Spike. Angel ends the discussion by saying he wants to sleep on the decision. That night, Spike shows up in Angel's bedroom and reveals that he overheard the group talking about him. He also admits that Hainsley tried to make a deal with him, but he wants Angel to end his life. They head to a cemetery with the amulet and say their goodbyes. Angel picks up an urn and tries to smash the amulet but instead hits himself in the head. Hainsley appears, to which Spike complains that Hainsley almost let Angel destroy him. Hainsley knocks Angel out and states that he will not let anything happen to Spike because he plans on using Spike. Spike protests, but Hainsley assures Spike that he will be in Angel's body soon. As Angel awakens in Hainsley's workshop, Spike contemplates the things he can do with Angel's body, including Fred. Hainsley starts the essence-entering spell, but is unable to complete it because Spike took over Hainsley's body during the spell. Hainsley realizes what Spike is doing, and that he can no longer control. Angel shoves Hainsley into the table, then Hainsley begins vigorously punching Angel. Angel decapitates Hainsley and Spike reappears, revealing that Hainsley died when he hit the table and Spike was just enjoying hitting Angel. Back at Wolfram & Hart, Angel tells Wesley that Spike came to Angel with his plan to defeat Hainsley; Wesley says that Spike should have run the plan by everyone first. Angel says that Spike isn't good at sharing. Spike pays Fred a visit in the science lab, saying that she's \\"the science queen\\" and might be able to help him. He reveals that he's being pulled to hell when he disappears. Continuity * Crossover with Buffy: The flashback at the beginning of the episode depicts Spike's death in the Buffy series finale, \\"Chosen\\". * After the destruction of Sunnydale in \\"Chosen\\", Buffy Summers is stated to be in Europe. Production This episode was focused on introducing the character of Spike to Angel, explains producer Jeffrey Bell, \\"but it was also about \`We work for an evil company with an evil client and he doesn’t want to go.’\\" =Acting= James Marsters makes his 100th Buffyverse appearance in this episode as Spike, dating back to his introduction in Buffy the Vampire Slayer's second season.

Known as one of the major categories in core-trimming flakes, the making of a tranchet flake involves removing a flake parallel to the final intended cutting edge of the tool which creates a single straight edge as wide as the tool itself. A large flint artifact with a chisel-end, the tranchet flake has a cutting edge that is sharp and straight. The cutting edge is unmodified in most cases; sometimes, it is polished for increased durability and/or sharpness. To make a tranchet flake, a flintknapper can hold the core from which the tranchet flake is to be removed in two ways: freehand or with it supported against the leg. Knapping freehand allows for greater control while supporting the core against the leg makes the work easier. The technique used to make the tranchet flake was used in the making of other tools as well, including tranchet axes (characterized by their trapezoidal or triangular shape) adzes, and even tranchet arrowheads. Unlike chisel arrowheads, tranchet arrowheads are transverse: this means they are knapped sideways, along the width of the flake versus the length of a flake like in the making of a chisel arrowhead. Also different is that tranchet arrowheads are made from a blade struck off a core versus being made from debitage like chisel arrowheads. The edge of the flake could be sharpened again by removing another flake from it. Known as the tranchet technique that makes the tranchet flake, this term can be defined in two ways: first, it is the forming of a straight edge used to cut from the edge of the tranchet flake by taking off a large flat flake from the tip. Second, it can be defined as the method one uses to resharpen or form the cutting edge of either an ax or an adze. Evidence of the technique of the tranchet flake was first discovered in sites of the Acheulean age, and the flake is a corresponding technology to the Upper Paleolithic era. It is found in some Acheulean assemblages, and handaxes created using the method are called tranchet axes. They can be identified by the damaged edge (damaged from use) on their back side. Tranchet flakes were used to form other tools or weapons which would vary in shape and size. For this reason, the size and shape of tranchet flakes varies widely as well. In later Neolithic times, the tranchet flake seems to have been replaced by something known as edge-abrasion. Abrasion apparently was not as damaging as the tranchet flake technique (it kept more of the original tool or weapon intact) and tools were less likely to break with edge-abrasion than with a tranchet flake. At the Acheulean site of Boxgrove, West Sussex, England, the area containing Lower Paleolithic deposits on site is one of the largest in Europe. Included in the site are tranchet flakes; the site is deemed to be a place that was continually used for flintknapping. An experiment concerning this site was conducted that would replicate the tranchet axes found in Boxgrove (a total of 314 tranchet axes were found at the site). Using seven people who were right-handed and able to flintknap, the experiment showed that hand preference did not restrict which side was used during the tranchet flake removal. Four of the knappers produced flakes using both directions (right- struck and left-struck). Three knappers used the same direction all the time. The study also revealed that when the flintknapper had become skilled enough to be able to produce a tranchet flake, the range of flake types knappers can produce increases. Proving that hand preference did not restrict which side was used to remove flakes allowed those excavating the Boxgrove site to see that the knappers there preferred to remove tranchet flakes from the left side. However, it was noted habit could have come into play here: the knappers may have had a routine habit in making the tranchet flakes. However, the difference between handheld and supported against the leg knapping may also play a role: though handheld allows more control, supporting the core could allow for the production of what is deemed as the more difficult tranchet flake for right handers -the ones made from being struck from the left side. Another reason why the results between the experiment and real-life may be different is also the techniques and methods of making tranchet flakes. For example, the use of an antler hammer was similar between the two. But things like the postures flintknappers have while knapping and how they used both of their hands (the various positioning while knapping) of those past people of the Boxgrove site cannot be known. The experiment did show that a huge variety of holding positions exist, though the holding constraints did not affect how tranchet flakes were produced. References *Darvill, T (ed.) (2003).

It was the only Angel episode to carry a warning of graphic violence before it was first aired. In this episode, the spirit of Pavayne – a brutal surgeon who uses magic to send the loose spirits of Wolfram & Hart to Hell in his place – torments Spike. Fred invents a one-time use machine to make Spike corporeal, but Spike ends up pushing Pavayne into the machine to protect Fred. Plot As Fred is working late in the science lab, Spike pops up and Fred claims that she knew he'd followed her there from the lobby. Spike says that he's a pathetic ghost, since he can't pick things up and scare people. Fred argues that he's not a ghost, then notes that the temperature of the heat he radiates has dropped slightly. She promises again that she won't let him stay in the netherworld (see “Unleashed”) and will make him “as real as a vampire with a soul can be.” Fred says if she can defy some laws of nature, she may be able to make Spike corporeal again and keep him in this world. Spike disappears, winding up in the basement, where he hears a chopping sound and goes to investigate. He finds a man with a cut-up face chopping off his own fingers; he does a double take and the man disappears. Elsewhere in the building, Lorne negotiates a deal as he passes Fred. Fred heads to Wesley's office and requests some books. He tells her that he'll get them for her if she agrees to have a real dinner, since she's been frequently eating takeout and working late. Eve takes Fred to Angel's office, where they discuss the amount of money Fred's department has been spending. Fred admits that she has to spend a lot to try to make Spike corporeal again; Angel says that he asked her to try to get him out of Wolfram & Hart. She reminds him that they were supposed to take over the firm to do good, but, of course, Angel says that that has nothing to do with Spike. Fred says that Spike is a champion, like Angel, but Angel has tired of the word “champion.” She thinks that Spike would fight on their side if he could; Angel disagrees. He adds that the second he can, Spike is going to run off to Buffy. Fred thinks he's jealous and assures him that she's immune to Spike's charms - she just wants to help him. Angel replies that some people can't be saved. Spike reappears in the lab and notices a buzzing lamp and a looming shadow. As he heads down a hallway, the lights start going out and he hears a woman crying. He encounters a woman from the 19th century without arms; she disappears like the fingerless man. Upstairs, Spike meets up with Angel, who thinks that Spike is starting to feel how close he is to Hell. Spike says that it can't be a big deal, since Angel managed to escape, but Angel says that he didn't, he just got a reprieve. Spike says that Fred told him about the Shanshu Prophecy, which Angel says isn't real because there's no such thing as destiny. He thinks that the evil things they did in the past are the only things that will wind up mattering. Spike asks why they should even bother to try to make good and Angel replies, “What else are we gonna do?” Spike resigns himself to being Angel's sidekick and Angel tries to get rid of him again. They banter a little and then Angel finally admits that he liked Spike's poems. “You like Barry Manilow,” Spike replies. He suddenly sees a man hanging from the ceiling and realizes that Angel doesn't see him. Later, Angel, Spike, Wesley, and Fred meet up in Angel's office, where Spike tries to get the ghosts to go away. Gunn and Eve arrive and announce that, according to the building's “spectral sweeps,” there are no ghosts. The ghosts tell Spike that something is coming as Spike begs Fred to do something to get rid of them. He disappears, then reappears, but no one can see him. The gang head off to look for Spike as a ghost tells him that no one can help him now. Spike spots the shadow from the lab again and follows it to the elevator, which starts moving on its own. Wesley, Gunn, and Fred head to Wesley's office, where they wonder if Spike is going crazy. Fred says that “he’s slipping into Hell.” The elevator takes Spike to the basement, where ghosts tell him that the Reaper is coming for him. A woman with glass in her eye takes out a shard, says, “Haven’t forgotten you,” and cuts his cheek. Up in the lab, Fred works on equations and is joined by Spike, who says that Hell is coming for him. He thanks her for trying to help him, despite the fact that she can't hear him. He tries to touch her to encourage her; she feels a spark and determines that he's there. Angel arrives and Fred tells him that she thinks Spike is there. He replies that the mystics did another sweep of the building and didn't find anything. Fred says she doesn't care and wants to figure out how to contact Spike before he's gone for good. The two of them meet up with Gunn and Wesley in a conference room, where they're joined by Eve and a psychic. The psychic conducts a quick séance, where she senses Spike's presence and says that he's in pain. She says that a “dark soul” is coming and Spike yells that it's the Reaper. The psychic starts choking and Angel thinks that Spike is attacking her. The psychic composes herself and appears to be okay, but then she explodes. Later, Wesley says that Spike wouldn't gain anything from killing someone who was trying to help him; she must have contacted the “dark soul” she said was coming. As Fred showers in the lab, Spike wonders why the Reaper killed the psychic; he decides that it was trying to hide something. He reaches out and manages to touch the glass on the shower. He concentrates, writing something on the glass, and when Fred's done, she sees “REAPER” written on the glass. Suddenly, the glass shatters and Spike is yanked through a wall into the lobby. There, he's harassed by more ghosts and demands to see the Reaper himself. The Reaper - who's British and dressed like Jack the Ripper - appears and says that he's going to torture Spike. Up in Wesley's office, Gunn finds information on the “dark soul,” but there are a lot of references to different people (four about Angel, who resents it because he didn't have a soul when he did them). Fred arrives and tells the others to cross-reference “reaper.” Angel comes up with the name Matthias Pavayne, an 18th-century doctor nicknamed the Reaper for performing unnecessary surgery. Rather than praising him for being brutal, Wolfram & Hart killed him and used his blood to de-consecrate the ground of the L.A. branch; the site the seers had determined would work was originally a church, so Pavayne's blood was needed. Angel notes that Pavayne practiced the dark arts, which is probably why he's not in Hell and can get around the mystics. Angel wonders why there aren't any ghosts in the building, since so many people have died there. Gunn says that Pavayne must be doing something to them, and Fred notes that Spike will probably be his next victim. Down in the science lab, Pavayne is having fun torturing Spike. Fred enters and Pavayne hopes that some day he'll get to deal with her. Spike tries to hit him, but he's still noncorporeal, so it doesn't work. Spike and Pavayne wind up in the basement, where Pavayne brags that he can bend reality, which is why the gang can't see Spike anymore. Pavayne and the ghosts taunt Spike, who says that Pavayne killed them all. Pavayne says that they died in service to the firm, but Spike says that he sent them to Hell, which means they're not really in the world. In the lab, Fred writes formulas on the windows; the others note that that's not a good sign and she assures them that she's not crazy, she just ran out of room on her whiteboard. Angel decides that they'll try to get Spike first, then deal with Pavayne. Fred says that in order to save Spike, they need a lot of dark energy. Gunn takes Angel to the white room, where Angel expositions that Gunn wants to take something from the conduit between Wolfram & Hart and other dimensions. They hear the panther from “Conviction” and Gunn speaks to it calmly, eventually making a deal when it appears. Back in the basement, Pavayne continues torturing Spike and opens a portal to Hell. He says that he's sending Spike there so that he himself can stay in this world. He tells Spike that he's getting what he deserves; Spike agrees that he deserves to go to Hell, but not today. As Spike starts fighting back, he notes that since reality bends to desire, he could touch Fred and write on the glass because he wanted to.. and right now, more than anything, he wants to kick Pavayne's ass. Spike starts hitting Pavayne, and they wind up in Angel's office; Pavayne fights back, appearing to enjoy himself. The group meet up in the science lab again and Gunn gives Fred what he took from the panther. Fred does her thing as Spike and Pavayne keep fighting each other. They get distracted by an energy burst and Spike runs away. In the lab, Fred determines that Spike is there and tells him to step into a circle she's drawn so that he can become corporeal again. Pavayne grabs her and starts choking her. The others figure it out and try to fight him, but he knocks them across the room. Pavayne notes that Spike can choose to become corporeal or he can save Fred. Spike appears beside him and knocks him into the circle, where Pavayne becomes corporeal. Angel starts fighting him and Spike, now visible to the gang, tells him not to kill Pavayne so he won't become a spirit again. Angel is fine with just beating him up a lot. The next day, Wesley and Gunn help Fred clean up the lab and try to make sure she's okay. Spike appears in Fred's office and she apologizes for being unable to do the ritual again to make him corporeal. He says that he's all right - he made the choice to save her instead and wouldn't change his mind. He's afraid of trying something else and winding up like Pavayne, who cheated death any way he could no matter who it hurt. Fred says what she told everyone else was right - Spike was worth saving. Spike shows off his ability to bend reality to his desire by picking up a coffee mug, reflecting that there are worse things than being a ghost. In the basement, Angel and Eve make sure that Pavayne is imprisoned in a device where he can't move or affect anything around him, but will remain alive for all eternity, staring at an empty hallway through the window in his door. “Welcome to Hell,” Angel tells him.

Plot As Halloween approaches, Lorne throws a Halloween party for all the firm’s clients and employees and even gets a reluctant Angel to invite a powerful demon lord, named Archduke Sebassis, to the party. During the gathering, Lorne's timely advice to his friends starts happening literally, leading to Fred and Wesley getting drunk after Lorne tells them to loosen up, Gunn to embarrassingly relieve himself to \\"stake out his territory\\", Angel and Eve to have sex, and even Spike and Harmony to have fun on the dance floor. The events lead to only more trouble when Lorne's empathic subconscious begins manifesting itself in a hulking demon (resembling a larger Lorne on steroids). The demon appeared as a result of Lorne's sleep deprivation after Lorne had Wolfram and Hart remove his sleep: an empath with long-term sleeplessness can write people's destinies instead of just reading them, and the empath's subconscious can physically manifest. The episode also reveals that Lorne is proud of his organizational skills, as he feels most of his other talents simply do not match up to what his friends can do. The larger Lorne causes much violence before the gang restores Lorne's sleep, thus neutralizing the monster. The chaos and destruction has a positive side: the rank and file of Wolfram and Hart express the opinion that it greatly improved the party. Continuity *The changes caused by Lorne's increased empath abilities have a similar effect to the spell cast by Willow in Season Four's Something Blue. *During the party montage following Artode's untimely demise in the bathroom stall, a green demon can be seen on the dance floor wearing the same tunic worn by El Eliminati in \\"Bad Girls.\\" Trivia *Lorne finds Angel hiding from the party in his office, watching a hockey game.

Written and directed by Jeffrey Bell, it was originally broadcast on November 5, 2003 on the WB network. Plot On the Mexican Day of the Dead, Angel has a run-in with a masked Wolfram & Hart employee. He is connected to an Aztec warrior demon named Tezcatcatl, who preys on the hearts of heroes. This leads Angel to wrestle with some personal issues when he learns about 'Los Hermanos Numeros', a family of five Mexican luchadores who helped the helpless until one day four were slain by Tezcatcatl. Angel helps the last member 'Number Five', the aforementioned employee, to discover the hero inside, which he lost when his family were killed. Angel, Five and his four brothers, temporarily back from the dead, battle and kill the demon. This leads to the death of Number Five, who is escorted into the afterlife by his brothers. Meanwhile, Spike researches the Shanshu Prophecy about a vampire becoming human and thinks that he, not Angel, may be the vampire who will become human. Production Writer/director Jeffrey Bell explains that he always wanted to work Mexican wrestling into one of his The X-Files scripts, but it wasn't until he pitched the idea to creator Joss Whedon that he was able to realize his \\"lifelong dream - to tell a story about Mexican wrestlers.\\" The inspiration for the episode came partly from the real life Mexican wrestler Santo whose career included film roles as masked \\"luchador\\" fighting vampires and other supernatural foes, one of whose films was used in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode \\"Samson vs. the Vampire Women\\". When Number Five is in the bar and Holland Manners holds out a Wolfram & Hart business card, there is a grammatical error on the multi-dimensional law- firm's calling card. It reads 'Attorney's at Law' as opposed to 'Attorneys at Law.' The Wilhelm scream can be heard approximately one minute into the episode. =Continuity= *In the non-canonical comic Spike: Old Wounds, Spike reveals that he actually met Los Hermanos Numeros in 1947, and chose not to tell the others. *While explaining why he no longer believes in the Shanshu prophecy, Angel mentions the fake prophecy made by Sahjhan that caused Wesley to betray Angel Investigations in season 3. Due to having his memory altered in the fourth season finale, Wesley doesn't understand what Angel is talking about. *Number Five can be seen in several previous episodes but this is the first time he has any dialogue. This episode also marks Number Five's last appearance. *When Number Five is approached by a Wolfram & Hart employee at the bar after his brothers' deaths the business card shows that the employee is actually Holland Manners. *When Angel visited Number Five at his home, he never invited Angel into his home before grabbing Angel and throwing him against the wall inside his kitchen.

Early life Frankie Fraser was born on Cornwall Road in Waterloo, London. His mother was of Irish and Norwegian ancestry, while his father was half Native-American. Fraser was the youngest of five children and grew up in poverty. At the age of five, he moved with his family to a flat on Walworth Road, Elephant and Castle. Although his parents were not criminals, Fraser turned to crime aged 10 with his sister Eva, to whom he was close. He was a deserter during the Second World War, escaping from his barracks on several occasions. It was during the war that he first became involved in serious crime, with the blackout and rationing, combined with the lack of professional policemen due to conscription, providing ample opportunities for criminal activities such as stealing from houses while the occupants were in air-raid shelters. In 1941, Fraser was sent to borstal for breaking into a Waterloo hosiery store, then given a 15-month prison sentence at HM Prison Wandsworth for shop-breaking. Such were the criminal opportunities during the war, Fraser joked in a television interview years later, that he had never forgiven the Germans for surrendering. In 1942, while serving a prison sentence in HM Prison Chelmsford, he came to the attention of the British Army. Although he was conscripted, Fraser later boasted that he had never once worn the uniform, preferring to ignore call-up papers, desert and resume his criminal activities. Post-war After the war, Fraser was involved in a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller, for which he received a two- year prison sentence, mostly served at HM Prison Pentonville. It was during this sentence that he was first certified insane and was sent to Cane Hill Hospital before being released in 1949. During the 1950s, Fraser's main occupation was as bodyguard to well-known gangster Billy Hill. After being sent to HM Prison Durham for taking part in bank robberies, he was again certified insane and this time was sent to Broadmoor Hospital. Afraid of being heavily medicated for bad behaviour, Fraser stayed out of trouble and was released in 1955. The following year, the British mobster Jack Spot and wife Rita were attacked, on Hill's say-so, by Fraser, Bobby Warren and at least half a dozen other men. Both Fraser and Warren were given seven years for their acts of violence. Richardson Gang It was in the early 1960s that Fraser first met Charlie and Eddie Richardson of the Richardson Gang, rivals to the Kray twins. According to Fraser, it was they who helped him avoid arrest for the Great Train Robbery by bribing a policeman. Together they set up the Atlantic Machines fruit-machine enterprise, which acted as a front for the criminal activities of the gang. In 1966, Fraser was charged with the murder of Richard Hart, who was shot at Mr Smith's club in Catford while other Richardson associates, including Jimmy Moody, were charged with affray. A witness changed his testimony and the charges were eventually dropped, though Fraser still received a five-year sentence for affray. He was also tried in court in the so-called 'Torture trial', in which members of the Richardson Gang were charged with burning, electrocuting and whipping those found guilty of disloyalty by a kangaroo court. Fraser himself was accused of pulling out the teeth of victims with a pair of pliers. Following a trial at the Old Bailey in 1967, he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Violence Fraser's 42 years served in over 20 different prisons in the UK were often coloured by violence. He was involved in riots and frequently fought with prison officers and fellow inmates. He also attacked various governors. Fraser was one of the ringleaders of the major Parkhurst Prison riot in 1969, spending the following six weeks in the prison hospital because of his injuries. Involvement in such activities often led to his sentences being extended. Whilst in Strangeways, Manchester in 1980, Fraser was 'excused boots' as he claimed he had problems with his feet because another prisoner had dropped a bucket of boiling water on them after Fraser had hit him; he was allowed to wear slippers. He was released from prison in 1985. Later life Fraser became a minor celebrity of sorts, appearing on television shows such as Operation Good Guys, Shooting Stars, and the satirical show Brass Eye, where he said Noel Edmonds should be shot for killing Clive Anderson (an incident invented by the show's producers), and writing an autobiography. In 1996, he played (his friend) William Donaldson's guide to Marbella in the infamous BBC Radio 4 series A Retiring Fellow. In 1999, he appeared at the Jermyn Street Theatre in London in a one-man show, An Evening with Mad Frankie Fraser (directed by Patrick Newley), which subsequently toured the UK. Fraser also appeared as East End crime boss Pops Den in the feature film Hard Men, a forerunner of British gangster movies such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and had a documentary made of his life, Mad Frank, which was released as part of The Ultimate Gangster DVD (2003 Gangster Videos), which featured crime figures Charles Bronson, John McVicar, Paddy Joe Hill, Albert Reading, Dave Courtney, Roy Shaw, Norman Parker, Marilyn Wisbey and axe victim Eric Mason. This programme was also shown on the Crime & Investigation and Biography channels in the UK and was directed by Liam Galvin. London-based production company Classic Media Entertainment has secured the film rights to Mad Frankie's life. A feature film production is currently in development with Fraser's endorsement. Fraser gave gangland tours around London, where he highlighted infamous criminal locations such as The Blind Beggar pub. In 1991, Fraser was shot in the head from close range in an apparent murder attempt outside the Turnmills Club in Clerkenwell, London. Part of his mouth was shot away in the incident. He refused to discuss the shooting with the police. Fraser was an Arsenal fan, and his grandson Tommy Fraser is a professional footballer. Another of Fraser's grandsons, James Fraser, also spent a short time with Bristol Rovers. Another grandson, Anthony Fraser, was being sought by police in February 2011 for his alleged involvement in an alleged £5 million cannabis smuggling ring. Fraser's wife, by whom he had four sons, died in 1999. He was a resident at a sheltered accommodation home in Peckham. According to Eddie Richardson, Fraser had Alzheimer's disease for the last three years of his life. In June 2013, the 89-year-old Fraser was served with an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) by police after a row with another resident. On 21 November 2014, he fell critically ill during leg surgery at King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill and was placed into an induced coma. On 26 November, Fraser died after his family made the decision to turn off his life-support machine.

Plot Wesley meets with a man named Emil in a warehouse and is displeased to be talking to a middleman when he had expected to meet with the distributor. Fred appears with a highly specialized rifle that has been custom-made by Wolfram & Hart and details the specs for Emil. Wesley notes that the whole shipment of guns is ready for delivery, but refuses to do any business until he meets the distributor. Emil starts to give him the name of the distributor when the three are attacked. Wesley, leaving Fred unarmed, shoots and kills Emil's bodyguards. As the fight intensifies, Angel arrives and kills Wesley's assailant with a chain. He gets a jolt of electricity, and when he pulls off the guy's mask, he sees a metal plate instead of a face. Wesley realizes that Fred has been injured in the attack, and Angel is angry at Wesley for putting her in danger. Back at Wolfram and Hart, Angel blasts Wesley for putting Fred in danger as Eve tries to calm him down. Wesley argues that he needed Fred there to explain the weaponry to Emil; he chose her because she wouldn't make Emil suspicious, and she would be able to explain the weapon convincingly. Angel calls this a “reckless decision” and says that Wesley has to clear things like this with Angel. Eve wonders if Angel is really still mad at Wesley for taking Connor. Angel argues that Wesley was trying to do the right thing. “Are you worried about the next time Wesley betrays you trying to do ‘the right thing’?” Eve asks. With her arm in a sling, Fred reunites with Wesley, explaining that she had been injured by a grappling hook. She tells him that they’re taking the cyborg apart in the lab to learn more about it. Wesley apologizes for getting her hurt, but she blames herself. He says that he should have protected her and she blasts him for being condescending. “Stop trying to be valiant,” she tells him. “You’re coming off like a self-pitying child.” Wesley looks past her and greets his father; she thinks he's being sarcastic, but his father, Roger Wyndam-Pryce, is actually there. Fred meets him, then rushes off, embarrassed at her outburst. Roger tells Wesley that they have to discuss some business - now that the Watchers Council has been destroyed, the other former Watchers, including Roger, want to reform the Council. Roger has come to assess whether Wesley should be invited back. When Wesley says he's not interested, Roger replies that he has the chance to clear the Wyndam-Pryce name. Wesley repeats that has no intention of leaving Wolfram & Hart, which Roger insists is nothing but an evil law firm despite Wesley's protestation that they are serious about doing good work. Lorne passes by, discussing movie business, and meets Roger, who's sarcastic about the effect an entertainment division will have on fighting evil. Gunn arrives to tell Wesley that the lab wants him to come look at the cyborg from the previous night. Wesley reluctantly invites Roger to tag along. In the lab, Fred tells Angel that the body housing the cyborg may have once been human. As they discuss the blending of man and machine, Spike is interested, noting that sex with robots is more common than people think. Fred wants to access the cyborg's memory base so that they can trace its previous actions and possibly discover its purpose. Wesley introduces his father, who notes that he and Spike had met in Vienna in 1963 as Spike was slaughtering an orphanage. Spike looks uncomfortable and asks how Mr. Pryce has been. Fred asks Wesley to decipher some symbols found on the cyborg, and Roger reveals that Wesley had been Head Boy back at the Academy (noting, however, that the pickings were a bit slim that year), and Spike is delighted at the revelation. As Wesley begins to work, he accidentally activates a bomb. Wesley orders Fred to get as far away from the building as possible, announcing that he'll stay back and try to defuse the bomb. Suddenly, the bomb stops, thanks to Roger, who had more accurately translated the symbols. Angel wants to know what happened, and Spike gleefully reports that Wesley had been Head Boy at the Academy. Fred and Wesley explain the situation to Angel and tell him that Roger defused the bomb. Angel recognizes that Wesley is rattled by Roger's presence and notes how difficult father-son relationships can be. They discuss a report of assassins which might also be cyborgs; Wesley finds it interesting that the robots are fighting evil beings, possibly indicating that they are good guys. Later, after Roger tells Fred stories from Wesley's childhood, Wesley asks for his father's continuing assistance in dealing with the cyborg threat. Once they're alone, Roger asks about Wesley's feelings for Fred, but he doesn't want to chat about his love life. He mentions that his last girlfriend was murdered and he had to chop her up, at which point his father gives up on the conversation. Wesley shows Roger the special Wolfram & Hart reference books, which Roger thinks are dangerous and could attract evil thieves. Up on the roof, a bunch of cyborgs drop out of a helicopter. Eve gets into an elevator and is joined by Spike, who has noticed her watching him and wants to know why. He thinks that there's more to her than she's letting on, and she accuses him of the same. Spike wonders why Wolfram & Hart is keeping him connected to the amulet that brought him back, since it was intended for Angel. Eve replies that he can't assume it was intended for Angel. The lights suddenly go out and Spike yells that Pavayne will never take him to hell, eliciting a strange look from Eve. Gunn tells Angel that they may have lost contact with security. The cyborgs infiltrate and start fighting. A cyborg heads to Wesley's office, where Wesley keeps his father from fighting it. Roger is upset about this and notes that the cyborg went straight for the books. They gather up the books and head through a secret vault, where Roger allows that Wesley handled the cyborg well. He then knocks Wesley out, steals some kind of wand from one of the vaults, and speaks into a communications device: “Phase one complete. Begin phase two.” Angel, Gunn, and some others fight cyborgs in the lobby as Wesley regains consciousness in the secret vault. Back in his lobby, he sees that the cyborg he fought earlier is still alive. Fred runs into Roger, who says that Wesley went up to the roof to investigate something and asked him to tell Angel. Fred offers to take him to Angel. In his office, Wesley tortures the cyborg for information, demanding to know what Roger is up to. In the lobby, Angel and Gunn keep fighting and are joined by Spike, who is able to concentrate long enough to hit the cyborg attacking Gunn. Roger and Fred arrive and tell Angel to meet Wesley on the roof; Angel and Roger head up. Once they arrive, Angel realizes that Wesley isn't there. Roger points the wand that he took from Wesley's vaults at Angel, drawing white smoke from Angel's body. Wesley arrives and holds a gun on Roger, concluding that his father is removing Angel's free will so that Angel will be his slave. He accuses Roger of ordering the cyborg attack in order to smuggle in a weapon. Fred comes up to the roof as Roger blasts Wesley for working for Angel when he knows who he is. Wesley taunts his father, insinuating that Roger fears Wesley is better than he is. As a helicopter arrives to extract Roger, he demands the wand, informing Wesley that he will kill him for it if he needs to. Wesley threatens to drop the wand, which will break it and return Angel's will to him. Roger tries to threaten Fred's life by pointing his gun at her, but Wesley immediately shoots Roger without a second's hesitation. Wesley is sickened and horrified by what has just happened, and even more shocked when Roger's body is racked with electrical charges, revealing him to actually be a cyborg. Later that night, Wesley and Angel discuss the cyborgs and wonder why they were after Angel. Wesley says that they must have crossed someone when they took over Wolfram & Hart. Angel says that others see them as weak, but Wesley corrects him, noting that they see Wesley as weak, which is why they targeted him. Angel says Wesley isn't weak - he does what he has to protect people and do what he knows is right. “You’re the guy who makes all the hard decisions, even if you have to make ‘em alone.” Wesley is disturbed that the Roger cyborg knew him so well. Angel points out that it had access to the Watchers Council files, which would have provided plenty of information. He tries to connect with Wesley by reminding him that when he first became a vampire, he really did kill his father. Wesley says this is a little different. On his way out of Angel's office, Wesley passes Spike, who says that when he first became a vampire, he killed his mother. Wesley, exhausted, wants no more details. He goes to his office and Fred stops by. Wesley asks her to please not tell him about how she killed her parents. She gives him a funny look and reminds him that it's not like he really killed his father - part of him must have known that it wasn't really him. Wesley says that, in fact, he had been positive that it was his father. Fred notes that Wesley did what he had to do when 'Roger' was threatening Wesley's friends. Wesley looks at Fred and tells her that 'Roger' had been threatening her. He tells her that his father pointed a gun at her and so he shot him. Fred and Wesley stare at each other until Knox interrupts, offering to take Fred home. Wesley tells her to go. Once he's alone, he calls his parents in England, just to see how they are. His relationship with his father is unchanged. Continuity * The end of this episode reinforces Wesley's tense relationship with his father, which was first introduced in \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" by Ryan in his demonic state, and later addressed in a scene at the start of \\"Belonging\\". Wesley informs Roger that he was put in charge of Angel Investigations, only to feel discouraged by his father's criticisms. * Spike's defensive comment that sex with robots isn't uncommon stems from the Buffybot, the robot he commissioned from Warren Mears during Buffy's fifth season in \\"I Was Made to Love You\\" and \\"Intervention\\". * Spike shouting \\"You'll never take me to Hell, Pavayne!!\\" when the elevator lights went out during the cyborg ninja attack is a reference to \\"Hell Bound\\". Pavayne was the 18th century ghost at the Wolfram & Hart building that was trying to feed other souls to Hell in order to keep from being taken himself. * Spike refers to killing his mother, who then, as a vampire, tried to 'shag' him. This is told in flashbacks in the Buffy episode \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\". * Emil was previously mentioned in \\"Spin the Bottle\\", when Wesley tells one of his men that if the weapon he got works out in the field, Emil would be hearing from Wesley again. * In one scene, Wesley's father mentions the destruction of the Watcher's Council building; this event happened in the Buffy episode \\"Never Leave Me.\\" * Roger calls Angel \\"a puppet . . . to the Powers That Be [and] to Wolfram & Hart.\\" Ironically, in \\"Smile Time\\" Angel gets turned into an actual puppet. * At the sight of a dead parent, Wesley stumbles off and vomits, similar to Buffy doing the same thing in \\"The Body.\\" * Apparently, in 1963, Roger and his \\"colleagues\\" caught Spike in the middle of \\"slaughtering an orphanage in Vienna.\\" Spike killed two council members before escaping. Reception The Futon Critic named it the 32nd best episode of 2003, saying \\"It's in this hour we see once again how far Wesley has come and how much he has changed over the years. More importantly, it finally moved along the plotline of Wes' secret feelings for Fred (Amy Acker) as he literally kills his father for her.\\" References External links * * Category:Angel (season 5) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Drew Goddard ","title":"Lineage (Angel)"},{"id":"3650084","text":"According to Hindu cosmology, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the space and universe has neither start nor end, rather it is cyclical. The current universe is just the start of a present cycle preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes. Thesis of creation =Rigveda: speculation on universe's creation= The Rigveda, composed between 1500 to 1200 BCE, presents many theories of cosmology. For example: * Hiranyagarbha sukta, its hymn 10.121, states a golden child was born in the universe and was the lord, established earth and heaven, then asks but who is the god to whom we shall offer the sacrificial prayers?Charles Lanman, To the unknown god, Book X, Hymn 121, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: Max Muller, Oxford, pages 49-50 * Devi sukta, its hymn 10.125, states a goddess is all, the creator, the created universe, the feeder and the lover of the universe;Charles Lanman, Hymns by Women, Book X, Hymn 125, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: Max Muller, Oxford, pages 46-47 * Nasadiya sukta, its hymn 10.129, asks who created the universe, does anyone really know, and whether it can ever be known.Charles Lanman, The Creation Hymn, Book X, Hymn 129, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: Max Muller, Oxford, page 48 According to Henry White Wallis, the Rigveda and other Vedic texts are full of alternate cosmological theories and curiosity questions. For example, the hymn 1.24 of the Rigveda asks, \\"these stars, which are set on high, and appear at night, whither do they go in the daytime?\\" and hymn 10.88 wonders, \\"how many fires are there, how many suns, how many dawns, how many waters? I am not posing an awkward question for you fathers; I ask you, poets, only to find out?\\" To its numerous open-ended questions, the Vedic texts present a diversity of thought, in verses imbued with symbols and allegory, where in some cases forces and agencies are clothed with a distinct personality, while in other cases as nature with or without anthropomorphic activity such as forms of mythical sacrifices. The Rigveda contains the Nasadiya sukta hymn which does not offer a cosmological theory, but asks cosmological questions about the nature of universe and how it began:  Cycles greater than Kalpa  In Hinduism, a Kalpa is indicative for creation and dissolution of a universe. However, there are a few cycles of time mentioned in Hinduism, which consists of several iterations of such \\"Kalpa\\"-s. First one of them is referred as \\"One Month of Brahma\\", which consists of 30 Kalpas and successive dissolution phases. Each Kalpa in the series are distinctly identified by different names. Current \\"Kalpa\\" is referred to as \\"Sweta-Baraha\\", next one will be \\"Neel-Lohita\\". Combining 12 such \\"Months of Brahma\\", one year of Brahma is formed. 100 such years of \\"Brahma\\" is called as a \\"Maha-Kalpa\\". Length of a Maha-Kalpa is almost 310 Trillions years. 8000 such \\"Maha-Kalpa\\"-s form one \\"Yuga of Brahma\\", whose length is 2.4 Quintillion years.

Colonial rule under the French began in 1900 when the Military Territory of Chad was established. From 1905, Chad was linked to the federation of French colonial possessions in Middle Africa, known from 1910 under the name of French Equatorial Africa. Chad passed in 1920 to French civilian administration, but suffered from chronic neglect. Chad distinguished itself in 1940 for being, under the governorship of Félix Éboué, the first French colony to rally by the side of Free France. After World War II, the French permitted a limited amount of representation of the African population, ushering the way to the clash in the political arena between the progressive and southern-based Chadian Progressive Party (PPT) and the Islamic conservative Chadian Democratic Union (UDT). It was eventually the PPT which emerged victorious and brought the country to independence in 1960 under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. French conquest European interest in Africa generally grew during the 19th century. By 1887, France, motivated by the search for wealth, had driven inland from its settlements on central Africa's west coast to claim the territory of Oubangui-Chari (present-day Central African Republic). It claimed this area as a zone of French influence, and within two years it occupied part of what is now southern Chad. In the early 1890s, French military expeditions sent to Chad encountered the forces of Rabih az-Zubayr, who had been conducting slave raids (razzias) in southern Chad throughout the 1890s and had sacked the settlements of Bornu, Baguirmi, and Wadai Empire. After years of indecisive engagements, French forces finally defeated Rabih az-Zubayr at the Battle of Kousséri in 1900. In the next years, the French gradually expanded into eastern and northern Chad, encountering heavy resistance such as during the Wadai War. France conquered the last independent polities in Chad in 1917, and had defeated the last major native insurgencies by 1920. Colonial Administration Two fundamental themes dominated Chad's colonial experience with the French: an absence of policies designed to unify the territory and an exceptionally slow pace of modernization. In the French scale of priorities, the colony of Chad ranked near the bottom; it was less important than non- African territories, North Africa, West Africa, or even the other French possessions in Central Africa. The French came to perceive Chad primarily as a source of raw cotton and untrained labour to be used in the more productive colonies to the south. Within Chad, there was neither the will nor the resources to do much more than maintain a semblance of law and order. In fact, even this basic function of governance was often neglected; throughout the colonial period, large areas of Chad were never governed effectively from N'Djamena (called Fort-Lamy prior to September 1973). Chad was linked in 1905 with three French colonies to the south—Oubangui-Chari, Middle Congo (present- day Congo-Brazzaville), and Gabon. But Chad did not receive separate colony status or a unified administrative policy until 1920. The four colonies were administered together as French Equatorial Africa under the direction of a governor general stationed in Brazzaville. The governor general had broad administrative control over the federation, including external and internal security, economic and financial affairs, and all communications with the French minister of the colonies. Lieutenant governors, also appointed by the French government, were expected to implement in each colony the orders of the governor general. The central administration in Brazzaville tightly controlled the lieutenant governors despite reformist efforts toward decentralisation between 1910 and 1946. Chad's lieutenant governor had greater autonomy because of the distance from Brazzaville and because of France's much greater interest in the other three colonies. As for the number of troops deployed in the country, there were three battalions for a total of about 3,000 soldiers. The lines of control from Brazzaville, feeble as they may have been, were still stronger than those from N'Djamena to its hinterland. In the huge Borkou- Ennedi-Tibesti Region, the handful of French military administrators soon reached a tacit agreement with the inhabitants of the desert; as long as caravan trails remained relatively secure and minimal levels of law and order were met, the military administration (headquartered in Faya Largeau) usually left the people alone. In central Chad, French rule was only slightly more substantive. In Ouaddaï and Biltine prefectures, endemic resistance continued against the French and, in some cases, against any authority that attempted to suppress banditry and brigandage. The thinly staffed colonial administration provided only weak supervision over arid Kanem Prefecture and the sparsely populated areas of Guéra and Salamat prefectures. Old-fashioned razzias continued in the 1920s, and it was reported in 1923 that a group of Senegalese Muslims on their way to Mecca had been seized and sold into slavery. Unwilling to expend the resources required for effective administration, the French government responded with sporadic coercion and a growing reliance on indirect rule through the sultanates. France managed to govern effectively only the south, but until 1946 administrative direction came from Bangui in Oubangui- Chari rather than N'Djamena. Unlike northern and central Chad, a French colonial system of direct civilian administration was set up among the Sara, a southern ethnic group, and their neighbors. Also, unlike the rest of Chad, a modest level of economic development occurred in the south because of the introduction in 1929 of large-scale cotton production. Remittances and pensions to southerners who served in the French military also enhanced economic well-being. But even the advantages of more income, schools, and roads failed to win popular support for the French in the south. In addition to earlier grievances, such as forced porterage (which claimed thousands of lives) and village relocation, southern farmers resented the mandatory quotas for the production of cotton, which France purchased at artificially low prices. Government-protected chiefs further abused this situation. The chiefs were resented all the more because they were generally the artificial creations of the French in a region of previously stateless societies. This commonality of treatment and the colonial organizational framework began to create during this period a sense of Sara ethnicity among persons whose collective identities had previously been limited to small kinship groups. Although France had put forth considerable effort during the conquest of Chad, the ensuing administration of the territory was halfhearted. Officials in the French colonial service resisted assignments to Chad, so posts often went to novices or to out-of-favor officials. One historian of France's empire has concluded that it was almost impossible to be too demented or depraved to be considered unfit for duty in Chad. Still, major scandals occurred periodically, and many of the posts remained vacant. In 1928, for example, 42% of the Chadian subdivisions lacked official administrators. An event occurred in 1935 that was to have far-reaching consequences throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In that year, the French colonial administration negotiated a border adjustment with Italy, Libya's colonial master. The adjustment would have relocated the Libyan-Chad boundary about 100 kilometers south across the Aozou Strip. Although the French legislature never ratified the agreement, the negotiations formed part of the basis of Libya's claim to the area decades later. Félix Eboué In 1940 Chad became internationally prominent when its lieutenant governor, Félix Eboué, led the rest of the French Equatorial African (AEF) federation to support Free France under Charles de Gaulle rather than the government of Vichy France. Chad became the base for Colonel Jacques Leclerc's conquest of the Fezzan (1940-1943), and the entire episode became the basis of an enduring sentimental bond between Chad and the France of de Gaulle's generation. More funds and attention flowed to Chad than ever before, and Eboué became the governor general of the entire AEF in November 1940. Born in French Guiana of mixed African and European parentage, Eboué was keenly interested in the problems of cultural dislocation resulting from unchecked modernization in Africa. He worked to return authority to authentic traditional leaders while training them in modern administrative techniques. He recognized a place for African middle-class professionals in cities, but he opposed the migration of workers to cities, supporting instead the creation of integrated rural industries where workers could remain with their families. When Eboué died in 1944, the AEF lost a major source of progressive ideas, and Chad lost a leader with considerable influence in France. Territorial assembly under France French voters rejected many of the progressive ideas of Eboué and others after World War II ended. Nevertheless, the constitution that was approved in 1946 granted Chad and other African colonies the right to elect a territorial assembly with limited powers. The Assembly, in turn, elected delegates to the French General Council of all the AEF. The position of governor-general was redesignated high commissioner, and each territory gained the right to elect representatives to French parliamentary bodies, including the National Assembly, the Council of the Republic, and the Assembly of the French Union. The African peoples became French citizens, and the colonies were designated overseas territories of France. But the real locus of authority remained in Paris, also because the 1946 reforms had sanctioned the existence of a dual college system for voting, with one reserved for the Europeans in Chad; the Africans could only vote for the collège des autochthones. French personnel continued to dominate the AEF's administration. No formal attempt was made to train Chadian Africans for civil service positions before 1955. On the bright side, the 1946 reforms abolished forced labour. Local politics Until the early 1950s, political forces originating in France dominated the development of politics in Chad. Local elections were won largely by members of the Chadian Democratic Union (Union Démocratique Tchadienne or UDT), founded in 1946, which was associated with a political party in France, the Gaullist Rally of the French People. The UDT represented French commercial interests and a bloc of traditional leaders composed primarily of Muslim and Ouaddaïan nobility. Chad's European community initiated the practice of using the civil service for partisan political ends; African civil servants who were identified with organizations opposed to the UDT soon found themselves dismissed or transferred to distant posts. For example, François Tombalbaye (later to become president) lost his job as a teacher and ended up making bricks by hand because of his union activities and his role in the opposition Chadian Progressive Party (Parti Progressiste Tchadien or PPT). Nonetheless, by 1953 politics were becoming less European dominated, and the PPT was emerging as the major rival of the UDT. The leader of the PPT was Gabriel Lisette, a black colonial administrator born in Panama and posted to Chad in 1946. Elected as a deputy to the French National Assembly, Lisette was later chosen as secretary general of the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain or RDA), an interterritorial, Marxist-oriented party considered quite radical at the time. The PPT originated as a territorial branch of the RDA and rapidly became the political vehicle of the country's non-Muslim intellectuals. Traditional rulers perceived the PPT to be antithetical to their interests and recognized that the local territorial assembly could adversely affect their revenue and power. These factors persuaded traditional rulers to become more active in the UDT, which, because of internal divisions, had changed its name in the late 1950s to the Chadian Social Action (Action Sociale Tchadienne or AST). Although party names changed frequently and dramatic factional schisms occurred throughout the 1950s, electoral competition was essentially between three political blocs: the UDT [AST], the PPT, and the allies of Ahmed Koulamallah from Chari-Baguirmi and Kanem prefectures. A clever politician and charismatic leader of the Tijaniyya Islamic brotherhood in Chad, Koulamallah campaigned in different times and places as a member of the Baguirmi nobility (he was an estranged son of the sultan), a radical socialist leader, or a militant Muslim fundamentalist. As a result, politics in the 1950s was a struggle between the south, which mostly supported the PPT, and the Muslim sahelian belt, which favored the UDT [AST]. Koulamallah played a generally disruptive role in the middle. Greater autonomy In 1956 the French National Assembly passed the loi cadre (enabling act), known as Overseas Reform Act, which resulted in greater self-rule for Chad and other African territories. Electoral reforms expanded the pool of eligible voters, and power began to shift from the sparsely settled northern and central Chadian regions toward the more densely populated south. The PPT had become less militant, winning the support of chiefs in the south and members of the French colonial administration, but not that of private French commercial interests. In the 1957 elections, held on March 31, out of 65 seats, the PPT took 32; its allies, the Chadian Independent Socialist Party (PSIT) and the UDT, took 15; the Chadian Independents and Agrarians Rally (GIRT), an offshoot of the AST, 9; the AST, 8 and the last seat went to an independent candidate. As a result of this victory, Lisette and the PPT formed the first African government in Chad. He maintained a majority for only about a year, however, before factions representing traditional chiefs withdrew their support from his coalition government. French federation versus full independence In September 1958, voters in all of Africa's French territories took part in a referendum on the Fifth Republic's constitution, drawn up under de Gaulle. For a variety of political and economic reasons, most of Chad's political groups supported the new constitution, and all voted for a resolution calling for Chad to become an autonomous republic within the French Community. The three other AEF territories voted similarly, and in November 1958 the AEF was officially terminated. Coordination on such issues as customs and currency continued among the four territories through written agreements or on an ad hoc basis. Nonetheless, some Chadians supported the creation of an even stronger French federation, rather than independence. The leading proponent of this proposal was Barthélemy Boganda of Oubangui-Chari, but his death in 1959 and the vigorous opposition of Gabon resulted in political independence on a separate basis for all four republics. After Lisette's coalition crumbled in early 1959, two other alliances governed briefly. Then in March the PPT returned to power, this time under the leadership of Tombalbaye, a union leader and representative from Moyen-Chari Prefecture. Lisette, whose power was undermined because of his non-African origins, became deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic coordination and international relations. Tombalbaye soon consolidated enough political support from the south and north to isolate the opposition into a collection of conservative Muslim leaders from central Chad. The latter group formed a political party in January 1960, but its parliamentary representation steadily dropped as Tombalbaye wooed individual members to the PPT. By independence in August 1960, the PPT and the south had clearly achieved dominance, but Tombalbaye's political skills made it possible for observers to talk optimistically about the possibility of building a broad-based coalition of political forces.

Co-written by David Fury and Steven S. DeKnight and directed by Skip Schoolnik, it was originally broadcast on November 19, 2003 on the WB network. In \\"Destiny\\", when a mysterious package arrives at Wolfram & Hart that renders Spike corporeal again, Eve claims the universe is in chaos because the Shanshu Prophecy states only one vampire with a soul can be the champion of good. Angel and Spike duel over a mystical grail to decide which one will be the champion, as flashbacks show the complex relationship between the two vampires. Guest star Juliet Landau reprises her role as Drusilla, and Christian Kane makes an uncredited appearance at the end of the episode playing Lindsey McDonald. Plot The episode begins with a flashback to London in 1880, where recently sired William (not yet Spike) meets Angelus for the first time. Angelus accepts William into the group, saying he looks forward to killing with another man, and vows he and Spike are \\"gonna be the best of friends,\\" sealing the friendship by allowing their clasped hands to be burned by sunlight. In the present, Spike demands his own office (or Wesley's office during his leave of absence, while he adjusts to the shock of killing what he believed to be his father). Spike lacks sympathy for Wesley, since he himself killed his mother while she was hitting on him. \\"Well…that explains a lot,\\" Harmony remarks. She opens a package for Spike from an unknown source, producing a flash of light. When Harmony goes to answer the phone, she's greeted by electronic screeching. As phones start ringing off the hook, Spike heads for Angel's office, but when he tries to walk through the door, he quickly finds he is corporeal again, and celebrates with Harmony. Fred arrives, complaining that all of the atmospheric gauges in the science department have gone haywire and blown out the instruments. She is surprised to hear that Harmony and a re-corporealized Spike are, as Gunn says, \\"having a nooner\\". Eve arrives and announces that the whole universe is in turmoil – Spike's existence is messing with the expected course of the Shanshu prophecy, because after dying on the Hellmouth to save the world in the series finale of Buffy, Spike now qualifies as a champion. Meanwhile, Harmony's eyes start bleeding and she bites Spike, screaming that he's using her and really wants his \\"Slayer whore\\". He returns to the group, and Eve says because there are two possible candidates for the Shanshu, \\"the wheel of destiny starts to spin off its axis.\\" Gunn returns with news that the elevator to the Senior Partners opened into a howling abyss. Eve thinks the solution is in the Shanshu prophecy, but Angel says he just read it and it wasn't helpful. Spike is surprised he has been reading the prophecy which he claims not to believe in. They decide someone from Wesley's department needs to look over the prophecy, and meet with Sirk, who tells them that they read a translation and therefore didn't get everything out of it. He retranslates: \\"The balance will falter until the vampire with a soul drinks from the Cup of Perpetual Torment\\". Sirk says that whoever drinks from the cup is the one who was destined to, and once the champion is decided the universe will go back to normal. Sirk says the cup is in a destroyed opera house in Death Valley, Nevada. Back in 1880, Angelus and William celebrate a wedding massacre, until William leaves to be with Drusilla, whom William calls his \\"destiny\\". Shortly after, William discovers Angelus having sex with Drusilla; the two laugh at William and Angelus taunts him with his earlier words. At the opera house, Spike and Angel battle it out for the cup. Spike points out that Angel's soul was forced upon him as a curse, but Spike fought for his because it was the right thing to do. Angel says he only did it so he could sleep with Buffy. Spike says that Angel has already chosen the side of evil by working at Wolfram & Hart. Angel retaliates that it is a lot more complicated than Spike thinks, telling Spike that he (Spike) was always \\"a little simple\\". In the science lab, Gunn begins bleeding from the eyes, warning Fred not to trust Eve. He starts choking Eve, demanding to know who she really is. Fred tends to Eve, who starts crying and says that she knows what all the group think of her, but she's \\"not the bad guy.\\" Back in 1880, William fights Angelus for sleeping with Drusilla, whom he says belongs with him. As they trade blows, Angelus tells him that, among vampires, \\"There's no belongin' or deservin' any more. You can take what you want, have what you want, but nothin' is yours.\\" He adds that William should take Drusilla if he wants her; William chooses to keep fighting. At this point, the present-day fight has become very personal for both vampires, and both do whatever they can to hurt the other (physically and emotionally). Spike lashes out at Angel, saying that even though Drusilla sired him, it was Angelus who made him a monster, that Angelus just wanted something in the world as bad as him, and goads Angel about his (Spike's) sexual past with Buffy. In turn, Angel laughs off Spike's claims that Spike is a hero, points out that Angelus simply opened the door to let the real Spike out, and dismisses Spike's past with Buffy, telling Spike \\"That's why Buffy never really loved you. Because you weren't me.\\" Spike eventually gets the upper hand and stakes Angel's shoulder rather than his heart, saying he would have dusted Angel but he doesn't want to hear Buffy complain. Spike grabs the cup and Angel tells him that it's not a prize – it's a burden: \\"Do you even really want it? Or is it that you just want to take something away from me?\\" \\"Bit of both,\\" Spike replies, drinking from the cup. His expression changes as he realizes the cup is filled with Mountain Dew. Angel returns to Wolfram & Hart with the news that the cup was a set-up; Sirk has disappeared. Gunn and Harmony regain consciousness, back to normal. Back in Angel's office, Eve tells everyone the Senior Partners temporarily fixed things. She says that they don't know anything about Sirk's trick and are as angry as Angel is. Angel confesses to Gunn that Spike beat him in their fight – saying it was because Spike wanted it more. \\"What if it means that...I'm not the one?\\" Angel wonders. Elsewhere in L.A., Eve enters an apartment and undresses while gloating to someone off- camera that Angel and Spike fell for the cup story and Sirk disappeared without the Senior Partners knowing anything. In addition, the gang is wondering if they can trust the Senior Partners. She crawls into bed and it is revealed that she is with a tattooed Lindsey McDonald. \\"Well...it's a start,\\" he replies. Continuity *Angel tells Eve that a mysterious package was responsible for re-corporealizing Spike, much like the one that arrived in \\"Conviction\\" that caused Spike to materialize. *This episode reveals the first time that Spike and Angelus actually meet. This was never done in the previous seasons of Buffy or Angel as any other time they are on screen together, they already know each other. *Given Wesley's absence, this is the only episode of the series not to feature any of the members of Angel Investigations from the first season with the exception of Angel himself. *After Spike hits Angel across the room with the cross, he stands holding the cross as his skin burns and says, \\"You've never met the real me.\\" This is the same thing he tells Buffy in the Season Seven episode \\"Never Leave Me\\" when he asks her to kill him. =Arc significance= *Lindsey McDonald returns in the final moments of the episode, having not been seen since the Season Two episode \\"Dead End\\". He will go on to play an important role later in the season, and will appear in the series finale. *Spike regains corporeal form, courtesy of what will be revealed as Lindsey.

Production Although credited, Alexis Denisof doesn't appear in this episode. This was due to his and Alyson Hannigan's wedding at the time of filming. This is the only episode from which he is absent following his first Angel appearance in Season One's \\"Parting Gifts\\". In the season retrospective, Joss Whedon says the battle between Angel and Spike in this episode is the highlight of the final season.Whedon, Joss. \\"Angel: The Final Season,\\" Angel Season Five, 20th Century Fox DVD, Disk 6, 2004. That battle, Scott McLaren argues, \\"succeeds in portraying an almost perfect balance between the concepts of the soul as existential metaphor and ontological reality.\\" Since the Shanshu prophesy destines the ensouled vampire to a pivotal and dangerous role in the ultimate battle between good and evil, Spike and Angel's souls function both as \\"heavy burdens and precious baubles.\\" Nancy Holder says this episode marks the transition from Spike's characterization as it was in the seventh season of Buffy to a new, \\"never-before seen\\" version, defined by his relationship with Angel instead of Buffy. When Angel tells Spike that \\"Buffy never really loved you, because you weren't me\\", and Spike responds with \\"Guess that means she was thinking about you all those time I was puttin' it to her\\", Holder says that Spike is \\"betraying all the soft emotion he had for her in his eagerness to deal Angel a blow.\\" Rather than reacting out of love for Buffy, the new Spike cares only about putting down Angel. Adam Ward, the first assistant/focus puller, says the scenes at the abandoned Opera House were unexpectedly difficult to film. \\"It's one thing to see it on camera and another being on location in this theater that hasn't been used other than for film shots for decades. You get in there and the matter that floats around looks great on camera but you just don't want to breathe it in.\\" =Acting= Christian Kane returned as Lindsey McDonald in the last moment of the final scene of this episode, which Sarah Thompson describes as \\"a secret scene\\" that didn't appear in the original script. She says, \\"I heard rumors there was going to be a big reveal, but I didn't know what was going to happen. David Boreanaz was like, 'Maybe you're going to turn out to be a lizard.'\\" She received the scene in an envelope marked 'confidential' shortly before filming, with strict orders not to reveal Kane's return. Juliet Landau, excited to return to Angel, says, \\"this is a particularly fun episode... There are so many different colors and dimensions. Even though [Spike and I] are the villains and we are evil, there always has been this very sweet love story between us.\\" Reception The Parents Television Council filed a complaint against a WB station for the flashback sex scene in which Angel's hips can be seen \\"moving back and forth.\\" The PTC was also disturbed by the \\"heavy breathing\\" in an earlier scene between Darla and Drusilla. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) later ruled that the scene was not indecent, as it was \\"brief, contained no nudity and was not sufficiently graphic or explicit to render the program patently offensive.\\" This episode, which ran during sweeps, was praised by TV Guide for the writers' decision to finally make Spike corporeal again. Reviewer Matt Roush says this episode stands with \\"the best of Buffy.\\" Author Peter David agrees that the producers had perfect timing: \\"Just when we're getting sick of Spike as a ghost, suddenly, just like that, poof, he's not anymore.\\" References External links * * Category:Angel (season 5) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in London ","title":"Destiny (Angel)"},{"id":"3650113","text":"Kanjuruhan Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Malang Regency, East Java, Indonesia.

Played by Karen Allen, she enters the story when Indiana Jones visits her in Nepal, needing her help to locate the Ark of the Covenant with a possession originally obtained by her father, Dr. Abner Ravenwood. After 27 years of absence (21 years in the films' internal chronology), the character returned in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and was once again played by Allen. Concept and creation Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan named the character after his wife's grandmother, and took the character's surname from Ravenwood Lane in California. Spielberg originally intended the role for his girlfriend Amy Irving. Sean Young and Stephanie Zimbalist auditioned for the role,https://www.thewrap.com/harry- hamlin-says-he-lost-indiana-jones-role-after-dissing-steven-spielberg-in- hidden-camera-audition/ Barbara Hershey was considered, while Debra Winger turned it down. Steven Spielberg cast Karen Allen, on the strength of her performance in National Lampoon's Animal House. Allen screen tested opposite Tim Matheson and John Shea, before Harrison Ford was cast as Indiana. Kasdan's depiction of Marion was more complex, and she was genuinely interested in René Belloq in earlier script drafts. She and Paul Freeman added more comedy in the tent seduction scene. Allen came up with her own backstory for the character, such as what happened to her mother, her romance with Indiana at age 15 or 16, and her time in Nepal; Spielberg described it as \\"an entirely different movie\\". After Raiders of the Lost Ark was released, Spielberg wanted Allen to return for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but George Lucas decided that Indy would have a different love interest in each film. Marion became a frequent supporting character in The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, a Marvel Comics title which ran for 34 issues from January 1983 until March 1986. During the 1990s, Lucas forbade author Rob MacGregor from including her in his novels for Bantam Books' Indiana Jones series. \\"How did Indy meet Marion? What happened in their earlier encounters? George apparently wanted to keep that for the future. Maybe we’ll find out in Indy 4,\\" MacGregor speculated. Frank Darabont claimed it was his idea to bring back Marion for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, during his tenure as writer from 2002 to 2004. Appearances =Films= Raiders of the Lost Ark Marion's father, Dr. Abner Ravenwood, was a professor of archaeology obsessed with finding the Biblical Ark of the Covenant; he was also a mentor to the young Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, who eventually accompanied them on several digs. Marion entered into a relationship with Indiana Jones during this time (when she was 15, according to the novelization of Raiders of the Lost Ark). Jones abruptly left the Ravenwoods in 1926; Marion was about 16 or 17 years old when the relationship ended, and Jones was 27, ten years her senior. Later in her life, Marion chastised Jones, stating, \\"I was a child! I was in love! It was wrong and you knew it!\\" Jones showed little remorse and simply replied, \\"You knew what you were doing.\\" After Jones broke off contact with them both, he returned to the United States to focus on his career as an archaeology professor, and Marion and her father settled in Nepal. She later started running a local tavern - \\"The Raven\\" - after its manager (her father) died and left it to her. Taking advantage of her high tolerance for alcohol, she would frequently drink the bar's patrons under the table on a wager. She refused to return to the United States until she had enough money to return \\"with style\\". In 1936, Marion found herself back in contact with Jones, when he offered her money for the headpiece of the Staff of Ra, an artifact originally located by her father. Reluctant at first, she was forced to cooperate when the bespectacled Gestapo agent Arnold Toht arrived to demand the piece himself. During the subsequent fight, the tavern caught fire. Marion told Jones that, until he paid her the full price he promised, she was his partner. She was then captured by the Nazis. Indy believed she was dead until, by a fortunate accident, he stumbled upon her with her hands and bare feet bound and gagged, and a knotted handkerchief between her teeth in one of the Nazi tents. To her chagrin, he decided to leave her, reasoning that an escape would draw too much unwanted attention, and regagged her with the promise to come back for her. The perceived betrayal did not affect Marion's refusal to cooperate with her captors, however. Belloq's advances resulted only in an aborted escape attempt, and Toht's interrogation was likewise met with uncommon resistance. After being captured by and escaping from Jones' rival, Rene Belloq, she helped Jones recover the Ark of the Covenant from the Nazis. In the process, the couple rekindled their relationship. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Jones continued to pursue archaeological artifacts, while Marion tried her hand at journalism before opening a bar in New York City named The Raven's Nest. For a time, she also worked as the public relations officer for the museum at Marshall College. However, a week before their planned wedding Indy left her without explanation and unaware she was pregnant with their future son Henry \\"Mutt\\" Jones III. Marion began a relationship with the RAF pilot Colin Williams (whom Jones had initially introduced to her) three months after Mutt was born, and they eventually married and lived happily until Colin was killed during World War II. Jones' eccentric old friend, Harold Oxley, then helped raise Mutt, acting as a second (technically third) father. Twenty years after Mutt's birth, Russians captured Oxley in an attempt to find the mythical crystal skulls that he had pursued. After she was captured trying to find Oxley, Marion sent Mutt to find Jones. After a desperate escape attempt, she revealed to Jones, who had remained clueless, that Mutt was actually his son. They argued so much that one of the Soviet agents finally gagged her. During the adventure, she and Jones again realized their love for each other. Back home, they were married, set to continue their adventures together.

The fort served as a staging area for the Forbes Expedition of 1758. During the eight years of its existence as a garrison, Fort Ligonier was never taken by an enemy. It served as a post of passage to the new Fort Pitt, and during Pontiac's War of 1763, was a vital link in the British communication and supply lines. It was attacked twice and besieged by the Native Americans, prior to the decisive victory at Bushy Run in August of that year. The fort was decommissioned from active service in 1766. Today, there is a museum next to the reconstructed fort. Inside the museum there are artifacts from the battle. An individual can take a guided tour of the fort, and on Fort Ligonier Days, the fort's cannons are fired. Forbes' campaign Soldier's barracks and quartermaster's store, 2012. French victories over George Washington and Edward Braddock in 1754–55 wrested from Britain control of the strategic forks of the Ohio River (modern Pittsburgh). By 1758, General John Forbes was assigned the daunting task of seizing Fort Duquesne, the French citadel at the forks. He ordered construction of a new road across Pennsylvania, guarded by a chain of fortifications, the final link being the \\"Post at Loyalhanna,\\" fifty miles from his objective. The fort was constructed in September 1758. By late October, George Washington had arrived at Loyalhanna, but not before the defeat of a British force at Fort Duquesne on September 14, and the successful defense of Loyalhanna from a French attack on October 12. Heavily outnumbered and losers in Indian diplomacy, the French abandoned Fort Duquesne, which Forbes occupied on November 25. He designated the site \\"Pittsburgh\\" in honor of Secretary of State William Pitt. Forbes also named Loyalhanna \\"Fort Ligonier\\" after his superior, Sir John Ligonier, commander-in-chief in Great Britain. =Campaign timeline= Reconstructed defenses of Fort Ligonier. * August 10, 1758—Colonel Bouquet ordered Major James Grant to build a road from Bedford to Ligonier (within striking distance of the French Fort Duquesne). * August 15, 1758—Col. Bouquet sent Ensign Charles Rohr, engineer for General Forbes, to the future site of Fort Ligonier to select a location for a storehouse there. * August 20, 1758—Col. Bouquet sent Major Grant, Col. James Burd and 1,500 men to the site to begin construction. Grant was in overall charge of the fort and men. * August 21, 1758—Ensign Rohr picked the exact location for the fort. * August 22, 1758—Col. Bouquet ordered Col. Burd's men and some artillerymen to build a storehouse for supplies and a hospital. * August 27, 1758—Burd and Rohr reported the location of a superior site to Ligonier, nine miles (14 km) to the west. When told of the new site, Forbes directed that work continue on Fort Ligonier, since construction had already begun. * August 29, 1758—Col. Burd and troops arrived at Fort Ligonier and built trenches around the fort. * September 1, 1758—Bouquet sent 100 men to entrench the \\"Grants Paradise\\" location south of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. * September 9, 1758—Major Grant left Fort Ligonier with troops and headed west to Fort Duquesne. On September 15, he approached within five miles (eight km) of Fort Duquesne before being beaten by the French, when his deliberate plan to lure out and ambush the fort's defenders went badly wrong. Bouquet arrived at Fort Ligonier with troops and wrote to Sinclair about the conditions of the fort, area and supplies, including wagons. * October 12, 1758—While the fort was still under construction, the Battle of Fort Ligonier was fought; the four-hour assault resulted in a French defeat. The French forces attempted to attack again at nightfall, but were forced to retreat by mortar fire from the fort. * November 12, 1758—The command of Col. Forbes ran across another squad of De Vitri's French troops lurking around Fort Ligonier. The British attacked, killing one and taking three prisoners. One of the prisoners turned out to be an Englishman who had been taken from his home in Lancaster County by anti-British Native Americans. His information concerning the weak condition of Fort Duquesne was corroborated by that of the French prisoners. Forbes therefore resolved to push forward to capture Fort Duquesne. * November 12, 1758—Units led by George Washington (1st Virginia) and Lieutenant Colonel George Mercer (2nd Virginia) accidentally engaged each other in heavy fog and at night. Two officers and 38 men were killed or wounded. * November 1758—4,000 troops encamped at the fort, making Ligonier the second-largest community in Pennsylvania. * November 25, 1758—Forbes captured Fort Duquesne. * March 1766—Fort Ligonier was abandoned after the conclusion of the French and Indian War.

Evans, 536 U.S. 452 (2002), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that the use of certain statistical techniques in the United States Census does not violate 13 USC §195 or the Census Clause of the Constitution. In instances where the Census Bureau remained unsure of the number of residents at an address after a field visit, the Bureau inferred its population characteristics with statistics taken from its nearest similar neighbor, a practice called \\"hot-deck imputation.\\" The use of hot-deck imputation in the 2000 Census increased the population of North Carolina 0.4% and Utah by 0.2%. Due to the practice, during the reapportionment of the US House of Representatives Utah received one less seat and North Carolina gained a seat. Utah sought an injunction requiring the Bureau to revise the published census results to those without the use of imputation. North Carolina, which stood to lose a Representative under such an injunction, intervened in the case, disputing Utah's standing to sue. The Utah federal district court refused to grant the State's injunction ruling in favor of the Census Bureau. Appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court, Utah argued that the Bureau's use of imputation violated 13 U.S.C. §195, which prohibits use of 'sampling' for apportioning Representatives among states. It further argued that imputation did not satisfy the United States Constitution's requirement of an \\"actual enumeration\\" for the purpose of apportioning Representatives. In an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court rejected Utah's arguments and affirmed the district court's opinion. In the majority opinion Justice Breyer reasoned that hot-deck imputation did not constitute sampling, which attempts to extrapolate statistics about a large population from the statistics of a smaller one, rather it attempts to account for missing individuals by comparing across populations. Furthermore, the Census Clause of the Constitution was not violated as the actual enumeration needs to be conducted \\"in such Manner as\\" Congress itself \\"shall by Law direct,\\" which wording which does not forbid the use of statistical methods to improve accuracy.

Sam Lawson, a mysterious man from Angel's past, arrives at Wolfram & Hart and takes Wesley, Fred and Gunn hostage. In a flashback to 1943, it is revealed that Angel was forcibly recruited by the Demon Research Initiative to recover a captured German U-boat with American sailors on board. The ship also has a secret cargo of three vampires: Spike, the Prince of Lies, and Nostroyev, who were kidnapped by a Nazi team. The submarine is damaged, and Lawson, the only surviving engineer, is mortally wounded. In order to save the rest of the crew, Angel makes Lawson a vampire (seemingly the only one he sired since 1898) and forces both Lawson and Spike out of the submarine to swim to shore. Sixty years later, Lawson seeks out Angel for revenge. Plot In 1943, a submarine crosses the Atlantic Ocean as its crew begins to panic. An officer named Lawson issues orders to the crew as an unseen creature kills their captain. In the present, Angel's team discusses Eve's disappearance. Wesley is concerned about her threats of revenge, but Gunn thinks that the Senior Partners will take care of her for them. Angel wants to make sure that Lindsey is being punished as well, but Gunn notes that the white room is still empty, so they no longer have a link to the Senior Partners. The team is surprised that Angel lets them leave early, but, since they all still have work to do, they agree to meet again in a few hours. They split up as Lawson arrives in the building. Later, Fred encounters him in the science lab and is disturbed that he knows her name. After he dissuades her from fleeing, he claims to be an old friend of Angel's. Back in 1943, a new agency, the Demon Research Initiative, presses Angel into joining the war effort to recover a German prototype submarine commandeered by the American military. After becoming trapped in enemy territory, the sub requires a vampire's assistance, as no human soldier can reach it. Though initially resistant, Angel realizes he has no choice. Lawson and his surviving men, who have barricaded themselves in a small section, recognize Angel's Morse code and let him in. In the present, Lawson captures Wesley as he attempts to help Fred. On the submarine, Angel gives a verification code and confronts the creature, who is revealed to be a dark-haired Spike, dressed as a Nazi; Spike says he merely ate a Nazi and took his jacket. Spike introduces Angel to two other vampires, Nostroyev and the Prince of Lies. Though Spike wants to kill the remaining humans, Angel disallows it, as they need the humans to steer the ship. When Nostroyev insists upon killing all but one of the crew, Angel kills him. In the present, Lawson confronts Angel in his office. Angel recognizes him and learns that Lawson has been keeping tabs on him. On the sub, Angel introduces the vampires and crew to each other. Though Lawson dislikes working with Spike, Angel reminds him that they have orders and must work toward winning the war. In the present, Lawson asks Angel if his actions on the sub were motivated by selfishness. Angel attacks Lawson, reminding him that he said he would kill him next time they meet; however, Lawson reveals Angel's captured friends. Back on the sub, Spike demands to be called \\"Captain\\", and Angel assures Lawson he can control Spike. Angel must stake the Prince of Lies after he attacks a captured Nazi, revealing the Prince as a vampire. After Angel and Spike interrogate him, the Nazi admits to having performed mind control experiments on vampires. Enraged, Spike again threatens to kill the entire crew, but Angel and Lawson stop him. Lawson insists the Americans have no similar plans. Angel orders the Nazi's report burned. Believing that Angel is playing both sides, Spike expresses both surprise and respect. Distracted by an explosion, Spike sets his clothes on fire instead of burning the whole report. The crew spots enemy destroyers, and the sub is rendered motionless. As Spike notes the Nazi has disappeared, the Nazi stabs Lawson. To save the sub, Angel turns Lawson into a vampire. Lawson repairs the sub, thanks Angel, and suggests they eat the crew. Angel forces him to leave the sub and swim 20 miles to dry land, warning him that he will kill him if he ever sees him again. Spike laughs but becomes irritated when Angel also forces him to leave. In the present, Angel tells Lawson that he never wanted to sire Lawson, but Lawson notes that it seems fair to sacrifice his life to help the Americans. Angel tells him that killing his friends will not change the past, but Lawson settles for hurting Angel. They fight, and before Angel kills Lawson, Lawson says, \\"Go on, Chief. Give me a mission.\\" The next day, Spike suggests Lawson was there for revenge, but Angel says that he came there for \\"a reason\\". Acting This is Alexis Denisof's 100th Buffyverse episode as \\"Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,\\" dating back to Buffy's third season. Camden Toy, who plays the Prince of Lies, previously appeared in Buffy the Vampire Slayer on several occasions.

This will play a major part in the next three episodes. =Continuity= *Contrary to Lawson's insistence, a significant portion of the Initiative's work eventually involves capturing vampires and demons and experimenting on them, attempting to develop a race of supersoldiers to use as military tools. When Spike is captured by the Initiative in \\"The Initiative\\", he asks a fellow prisoner the identity of the captors who mean to conduct experiments on them, specifically guessing that either \\"the government\\" or \\"the Nazis\\" are involved. *After the incident on the submarine, Spike and Angel won't meet again until Spike comes to Sunnydale in \\"School Hard\\". *During the episode, Angel says, \\"I'm not getting trapped at the bottom of the sea,\\" and Spike says, \\"I'm not getting experimented on by his (the American) government.\\" In \\"The Initiative\\", the Initiative place a chip in Spike's brain, and in \\"Tomorrow\\", Connor traps Angel in a box and sinks him in the Pacific Ocean. *Gunn's \\"brain upgrade\\" begins to wear out in this episode, evident in the beginning of the episode where he stammers during the meeting. *Angel states that Lawson is the only vampire he sired after getting his soul. =Anachronisms= During the flashback sequences there is little or no attempt to use the language of 1943. Anachronistic phrases like \\"back in the day,\\" \\"hold it together,\\" \\"don't lose your cool,\\" a joke that assumes everyone is familiar with a melon-baller, etc. abound. =Cultural references= * Why We Fight: The episode title is taken from the name of a famous series of American World War II-era propaganda films produced by Frank Capra, explaining the reasons the US was involved in the war. * Captain America: One of the sailors mentions the patriotic comic book character. Captain America was first introduced in 1940 and was popular throughout World War II.

Written and directed by Ben Edlund, with story by series creator Joss Whedon, it was originally broadcast on February 18, 2004 on the WB network. It was nominated for and won several honors and spawned its own toy line. In \\"Smile Time\\", Angel goes to the studio of a popular show after learning they are stealing the life forces of children, where he triggers a spell that transforms him into a puppet. While Angel and company try to reverse the spell and save the lives of hundreds of children, werewolf Nina declares her romantic intentions towards Angel and Gunn discovers his given knowledge of the law leaving his mind. Plot As a little boy watches a TV show called Smile Time, featuring puppets singing songs about learning, one of the puppets, Polo, tells the boy to put his hands on the TV. The boy's mother enters the room, horrified to see that the life has been drained out of the boy and his face is frozen in a rictus smile. In the science lab at Wolfram & Hart, Knox brings Fred files on children who have been hospitalized in the same condition as the little boy. Knox also gives Fred a valentine and tries to get her to discuss their potential relationship, but she gently declines his advances. When Harmony tells Gunn he filed the wrong papers, he tries to hide how worried he is about his mistake. Werewolf Nina arrives for her three nights of the full moon in the firm. She flirts with Angel as he leads her to her cell, and uncomfortable, Angel leaves. He heads up to Wesley's office, saying he's not sure how he feels about their platonic friendship turning into something else. Wesley tells him that Nina has been sending him signals, and Angel is apparently the only person in the entire firm who hasn't noticed them. When Angel says that he can't pursue a relationship because he'll achieve pure happiness and turn back into evil, soulless Angelus, Wesley says most people have to settle for acceptable happiness, and there is no reason Angel can't do the same. Fred arrives with the new case. Angel notes that all of the kids were watching TV when they became ill and Lorne says Smile Time is on at that time and in \\"the right demographic\\". Meanwhile, Fred goes to see Wesley and tells him that she needs a ride home, and is clearly hoping he'll be the one to offer. Unfortunately it's now Wes's turn to miss signals and instead arranges for a driver to take his friend home. Angel heads to Smile Time's studio and, ignoring the “Don't” sign on the door, enters a hidden room where a man with a towel over his head sits under a large egg. The egg opens, forming a glowing smile and a blast of energy tosses Angel across the room. Angel pulls himself up... only now he's a puppet. When Puppet Angel explains to the group what happened, Fred tells the lab to start recording Smile Time so she can analyze it. Angel orders Lorne and Gunn to talk to the show's creator, Gregor Framkin, at the studio. Nina arrives and Puppet Angel ducks under his desk so she won't see him. She tries to ask him if everything's okay, but he abruptly tells her to leave. Spike arrives, and is shocked and amused to see that Angel is “a wee little puppet man,” which sends Spike into fits of hysterical laughter. Puppet Angel gets angry and lunges at Spike. The two vampires fight, crashing through the office doors into the lobby for all to see Angel as a puppet. The fight then continues into the elevator, the doors of which close, and when the doors open Puppet Angel has somehow managed to beat Spike. Gunn and Lorne meet with Framkin at the studio. Gunn tries to tell him the laws he's violated, he can't come up with the right statute, and Framkin says he thinks he would be more likely to win than Wolfram & Hart in court. After Gunn and Lorne leave, it turns out that Framkin has a hole in his back and is being controlled by Polo. Framkin collapse as Polo pulls his arm out of a hole in Framkin's back and summons the other puppets - Groofus the dog, Flora, and Ratio Hornblower - with the news that Angel messed with the \\"nest egg.\\" Flora suggests that they remove the zombifying spell on some of the employees so that they can see future intruders, but Polo announces that since their “system” has now been perfected, they'll drain the life from all of their viewers the next day, instead of one kid at a time. Groofus is pleased at how important the next episode will be as he has a song he wants to sing, provoking Polo into hitting him for being foolish. Framkin begs the puppets to kill him, but instead, they continue torturing him. Back at Wolfram & Hart, Nina is preparing for her second werewolf night when Puppet Angel pays her a visit to apologize for the way he treated her earlier. She's shocked to see that he's a puppet and he notes, \\"I'm made of felt. And my nose comes off.\\" She tells him that he shouldn't care what people think of him, since he's a hero. Puppet Angel turns away starting to say how hard it's been to be a hero— when Nina suddenly wolfs out and attacks him from her cage. Upstairs, Lorne comes across a tattered Puppet Angel and yells, \\"Is there a Geppetto in the house?\\" Gunn heads to the medical wing to see Dr. Sparrow, explaining that he's losing his law knowledge. Sparrow examines him and tells him that the implant is failing in an \\"Acute Flowers For Algernon Syndrome\\"; the Senior Partners gave it to him in the first place because they wanted him to have it, and if it's fading, they must have wanted that as well. Gunn says that he doesn't want to go back to the person he was, so Sparrow makes a deal with him - he'll give him a “permanent upgrade” if Gunn signs a contract to ship something out of customs for him. In the science lab, Fred and Wesley agree they're starting to really like Smile Time, though that may be from sleep deprivation. Knox brings Fred coffee, but she orders him to go home. After he leaves, Fred confesses that she decided Knox wasn't right for her, and tries to tell Wesley that she has developed feelings for him; however, he doesn't get the message. Suddenly, while the sound of the show is muted, Wesley notices Polo seems to be talking to the audience. Puppet Angel's \\"vamp face.\\" Puppet Angel is trying to sew himself up in his office when Wesley and Fred arrive to tell him the puppets' singing acts as a cloaking device, allowing Polo to address the children directly. Wesley says the “nest egg” holds the life forces of the kids, so if they can break the magic on it, they'll save the kids and turn Angel human again. Gunn, who's regained his law knowledge, announces the puppets are actually running the show - Framkin made a deal with some devils to improve his ratings. Elsewhere in L.A., a little girl watches Smile Time and gets the message from Polo that all of the kids in the audience should put their hands on the TV. Puppet Angel and the gang interrupt and the fighting begins, with Gunn decapitating Groofus the dog and subsequently fighting the female puppet Flora while Angel goes puppet-to-puppet with Polo. Fred and Wesley rush to the \\"Don't\\" room with the nest egg, where Ratio fights Wesley while Fred reads the spell to break the spell around nest egg, destroying the egg and saving the kids after Wesley defeats Ratio. In the main studio, Gunn defeats Flora and Angel defeats Polo by throwing him onto the treehouse (after he reverts to 'vamp puppet face'). The next day, Nina wakes up in her cage with fabric around her and fears she ate Puppet Angel, until he comes in to tell her he's okay and will be back to normal in a few days. They agree to have breakfast together, with Nina jokingly wondering what puppets eat. In Wesley's office, Fred tries to tell him she's been trying to subtly indicate her interest. She grabs him and kisses him; he happily returns the favor as the puppets sing their self-esteem song again. Acting After reading the script, in which it was clear that Knox and Fred were not going to be falling in love, Jonathan Woodward says he was \\"very sad but I think it was nice, because it took Knox from all of the ways you thought Knox would be.\\" He had tried to predict the character's arc, he says, but \\"they picked the one I couldn't even think of. You know something is going to happen but they pick the thing you know nobody had been able to figure out.\\" Framkin, the puppeteer of \\"Smile Time,\\" is played by David Fury, who is a producer on the show. James Marsters confessed that \\"the puppeteers were so good that it was easy to believe that Angel was actually trying to kick my butt. I blew takes by laughing too much, actually.\\" Several puppeteers from The Jim Henson Company were involved in the episode, including Alice Dinnean-Vernon, Leslie Carrara, Victor Yerrid, Julianne Buescher, Tim Blaney, and Drew Massey. Production details This was the first episode of Angel to be aired after The WB announced that the series would not be renewed for another season. =Arc significance= *Gunn signs a contract to make his law knowledge permanent, not knowing his actions will play a part in the death of one of his teammates in the following episode. *Wesley and Fred's relationship begins. =Writing= Producer David Fury says the writers talked about doing an evil Sesame Street show before Season Five aired, but \\"it wasn't until Joss came around going, 'I figured out how to do it - Angel gets turned into a Muppet,' that we kind of went, 'Hallelujah, that's brilliant.'\\" Reception This episode was nominated for a 2005 Hugo Award in the category of \\"Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form\\", and was rated the series' second-best episode in a poll done by Angel Magazine. The BBC agreed, adding \\"it's surely one of Angel's most inspired and laugh-out-loud episodes. How such an innovative show can be canceled after producing something like 'Smile Time' is baffling.\\" In their \\"Year in Review\\", MSNBC singled out this episode for the tongue-in-cheek \\"Best appearance by a guest puppet\\" award, saying it managed to \\"send up not only children’s TV but the Angel series itself.\\" Writer Peter David was impressed that \\"they seemed to anticipate every single fan reaction\\" - for example, Knox's suggestion that the Joker was responsible for the children's illness. \\"Even more savvy,\\" David writes, \\"there was rumbling before the episode even aired that this was a 'Jumping the shark' installment.

A puppet. Nothing more needs to be said.\\" An Angel guidebook noted that the opening scene \\"sounds completely perverse, as though the puppets are pedophiles. A child is watching TV, then you hear 'Get over here and touch it' [followed by] loud, sexual groaning noises.\\" Inspired by the concept of Smile Time, IDW Publishing released a comic called \\"Spike: Shadow Puppets\\". Spike travels to Japan, where Smile Time is still the second biggest kids' show, and is transformed into a puppet. Diamond Select Toys created a plush doll for Puppet Angel; after rapidly selling their entire production run of 5,000 pieces they produced a second and a third Angel puppet replica, followed by Puppet Spike. The concept of Angel being turned into a puppet is revisited in IDW's \\"Angel: After the Fall\\", where Angel is briefly transformed into a puppet due to Illyria's newly regained time manipulation powers.

Written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, it was originally broadcast on February 25, 2004 on the WB television network. In this episode, Fred is infected by the spirit of Illyria, an ancient demon who existed before recorded time. The entire crew searches for a cure, but give up hope when Spike and Angel discover that the only way to save Fred's life would kill thousands of people. Wesley comforts Fred as she dies and witnesses the emergence of Illyria. Plot In a flashback to Texas, Fred's parents are helping her pack for her move to Los Angeles. As she packs her stuffed bunny Feigenbaum, Fred promises her worried parents that she will live a boring life. In the present day, at Wolfram & Hart's science lab, Knox accepts the delivery of a sarcophagus. When Fred touches the lid, a puff of dusty air is released, making her cough. Later, she meets Wesley downstairs and they kiss, thrilled to finally be dating. Lorne starts singing \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" to Fred, who picks up the song. Lorne immediately realizes that something is wrong. Fred suddenly coughs up blood and collapses. When Fred regains consciousness in the medical wing, her friends assure her that she'll be okay, even though they don't know what's wrong with her. Gunn goes to the White Room where he meets the conduit. Gunn wants to make a deal for Fred's life and offers to give up his own but the conduit tells him that the Senior Partners already own Gunn's life. Angel, Spike, and Lorne go to Lindsey's apartment, where they encounter Eve. She claims not to know anything about what's happening to Fred. Eve sings a little of \\"L.A. Song\\" and Lorne determines that she's not involved. Eve suggests they look through the oldest scrolls for information on the Deeper Well. In Wesley's office, he tells the group that the demon in question is called Illyria and it is hollowing Fred out so that it can come back. Angel and Spike travel to England where the Deeper Well is guarded. Wesley takes Fred home so she can rest. In her apartment, Fred asks for Feigenbaum, but cries when she can't remember who he is. Wesley reads A Little Princess to comfort her as she deteriorates. Angel and Spike arrive in the Cotswolds and meet Drogyn, the keeper of the Deeper Well. As they head into the Deeper Well, Angel explains to Spike that Drogyn cannot lie. Gunn and Knox discuss trying to cryogenically preserve Fred. Knox makes a slip of the tongue which Gunn catches, causing Knox to admit he is one of Illyria's acolytes. He tells Gunn that everything was planned millions of years ago and it can't be stopped. He also reveals that Gunn contributed by unknowingly getting the sarcophagus through US customs by signing the contract to make his law knowledge permanent after finding out it was temporary. Drogyn leads Angel and Spike into the Deeper Well, explaining that Illyria's sarcophagus disappeared a month before as it was predestined to do but the demon's essence can be drawn back to the well by a champion. However, if Illyria leaves Fred now, it would kill every person between Fred's body in L.A. and the Deeper Well. Angel realizes that he can't allow that many people to die, even to save Fred. As Wesley weeps and holds Fred's body in his arms, she begins to convulse, throwing them both to the floor. Fred rises from the floor as Ilyria. Acting Sarah Thompson sings \\"LA Song\\", which was written by series co-creator David Greenwalt and Christian Kane for Lindsey McDonald to perform on-stage in the Angel episode \\"Dead End\\". Thompson, who grew up doing musical theater, had begged Joss Whedon to allow her character to sing. Production details Joss Whedon admits he became emotional during the scene in which Fred dies: \\"I cried man tears when I wrote it, and when I filmed it and when I edited it...it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever filmed.\\" Amy Acker agrees, saying, \\"We kept crying while we were just reading the script; saying, 'We're not going to have any tears left!' Of course that didn't really hold true...\\" The final death scene was challenging for Alexis Denisof as well, who says, \\"There's a sort of tightening that happens with each scene where you feel it just getting worse and worse and I remember when we were shooting it that that was what kept choking me up. The situation of losing Fred was becoming more and more real and closer.\\" The scene where Gunn is fighting himself in the White Room was done by filming J. August Richards twice in two shots, as he switched between good and evil Gunn. Richards says of the experience, \\"It was one of the most fun things I've ever done on the show.\\" After filming the scene where Fred dies, Whedon, Acker, and Denisof \\"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events\\". Whedon would later use this moment as inspiration for the post- credits scene in The Avengers in which the Avengers silently eat in a shawarma restaurant after the film's climactic battle. =Writing= Whedon and the other writers decided to kill the character of Fred so that Amy Acker could \\"play somebody new, somebody who's regal and scary and different than anything she's gotten to do on the show. The best way to do that of course is to kill her and have her become somebody else.\\" The character Drogyn – who is established as someone who cannot lie – was introduced so that when he says Fred cannot be saved, the audience believes it, explains Whedon.

The scenes featuring Casey Kasem were filmed in a studio at CTV Ottawa. * A scene was scheduled to be filmed with Jim Varney but was cancelled due to Yasmine Bleeth's agent refusing to allow her to be in a movie with him. Ultimately his part was played by a local actor in Ottawa as head of the go-kart track. * Jay Leno was in talks to play the talk show host, but Casey Kasem ended up filling the role. * The Ottawa Citizen had an ad to find extras for the film. Anyone interested was asked to write a short letter and fax it in. From those, extras were chosen for filming throughout the film. * Glen Kulka, former football player and wrestler, moonlighted as security on the set. * A film premiere was held at the Coliseum Theatres on Carling Avenue the year after filming.

Plot synopsis The episode picks off of the ending of \\"A Hole in the World\\" as Wesley realizes that Fred has become Illyria. Wesley attempts to speak to her to see if Fred is still there but Illyria states Fred is just the \\"shell\\" she's inhabiting. She then throws him across the room and says that if humans are in charge, she has a lot of work to do. Meanwhile, Angel and Spike fly back home, frustrated and disconsolate. However, Angel believes that since the body houses the soul, there is still hope for Fred. Meanwhile, Gunn and Harmony have Knox tied up in Angel's office. When Wesley arrives, they tell him that Knox was involved with what happened to Fred. Wesley then announces that Fred is dead. Angel and Spike return from England and Wesley suggests that Willow could help them, but in the meantime, they have to keep Illyria contained. However, at that moment, Illyria bursts into Angel's office, knocks Harmony out and takes Knox to the lab as he is her Qwa'ha Xahn, her guide in this world. Angel calls Giles to find Willow, but Giles does not trust Wolfram & Hart and hangs up on him. Harmony then arrives and informs the gang of Illyria's presence. They try to stop Illyria and Knox from leaving the building, but she slows down time to escape. Afterwards, speaking with Spike, Angel vows he will not lose Fred like he did with Cordelia. In the science lab, Wesley smashes the sarcophagus and takes a crystal from it. Harmony finds Knox's cell phone and Wesley discovers that he has three missed calls from Dr. Sparrow, whom Gunn is questioning. Gunn begs Sparrow to take back the legal knowledge in exchange for Fred, but Sparrow explains Fred's soul was destroyed in resurrecting Illyria. Wesley arrives, having overheard their conversation and knocks out Sparrow and stabs Gunn with a scalpel, as punishment for his part in Fred's death. As Gunn recovers in the hospital, Angel asks Wesley to put aside his feelings to focus on dealing with Illyria. The team discovers that Illyria is trying to open a portal to her temple which is entombed with an army that has been waiting for her return. Knox finishes performing a spell to open the gateway for Illyria, just as Angel, Spike, and Wesley arrive. Knox tells them that they can't win this battle, but Angel offers to have mercy on him if he surrenders. However, Wesley shoots Knox. The gang fight Illyria, who beats them easily until Angel pulls out the crystal Wesley grabbed from the sarcophagus, which makes him unaffected by Illyria's time-altering powers. The portal opens and Illyria runs to her temple, followed by Wesley. However, her army is dead and her temple has been destroyed. Defeated, she returns with Wesley to the gang. Back in Angel's office, Angel says that they need to close the portal to make sure that Illyria does not try to raise another army. Spike decides to stay in L.A., since that is what Fred would have wanted. While Wesley packs up Fred's office, Illyria finds him. She explains to Wesley that there are still fragments of Fred inside her. Using Fred's voice, she repeats to him Fred's last words, \\"Wesley, why can't I stay?\\", which nearly causes him to break down, and she asks him to stay as she is stuck in this world and needs a guide. Wesley agrees because she looks like Fred but makes her promise not to kill anymore. She asks him if there is anything in this life but grief. Wesley replies by speaking of love and hope. Illyria asks him if that is enough to live on, but he can't answer her. In a flashback to Texas, Fred packs up her car, says goodbye to her parents, and heads to L.A. Production details =Acting= While writing the episode \\"A Hole in the World\\", Joss Whedon thought about using the character of Rupert Giles in the Deeper Well scene, but it would have been too expensive to fly in Anthony Stewart Head to guest star. In this episode Angel instead speaks to Giles over the phone.

He was born in the town of Clarksburg, West Virginia in Harrison County and was a three sport athlete at Notre Dame Catholic High School. He played college football for the Virginia Tech Hokies football team from 1965–1967, helping the Hokies to a berth in the 1966 Liberty Bowl. Loria was named 1st Team AP All American in 1966. Loria was named consensus All-American in 1967. He was named to the top six All-America 1st teams. Loria started all 31 varsity games that he was eligible to play in. Loria was known for being a physical hitter and for his quickness.Beamer & Colston P.40 He also had a \\"sixth sense.\\"http://www2.hokiesports.com/football/mg2001/mg2001history.pdf P.230 Loria had an uncanny ability to diagnose plays and pass patterns.http://www2.hokiesports.com/football/mg2001/mg2001history.pdf P.241 Loria played safety in the same defensive backfield with Frank Beamer, former head coach at Virginia Tech. It is indicative of Loria's stature, as well as Beamer's humility, that when Frank Beamer was once asked if he ever thought about \\"what if\\" that plane had not crashed, that he replied to the effect that he thought it was quite possible that Loria might be the coach at Tech, and that he himself might be an assistant.Beamer & Colston P.41 During the 1966 season in a game against Kentucky the Hokies were ahead 7-0 in the 1st quarter. Kentucky was on the 4 yard line trying to tie the score. Loria would sack Kentucky quarterback Roger Walz for a two yard loss. This was a significant in preventing Kentucky from scoring.Fitzgerald P.46 In October 1966 against a ranked Florida State team Frank Loria returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown that would prove to be significant in a 23-21 Virginia Tech victory.Fitzgerald P.38 Loria also made the game deciding 4th down tackle on a FSU running back on the goal line.https://virginiatech.sportswar.com/free- content/2015/06/09/tsl-poll-favorite-play-by-a-virginia-tech- db/https://www.gobblercountry.com/2019/8/21/20827505/virginia-tech- football-10-days-til-kickoff-with-a-look-back-at-frank- loria?fbclid=IwAR29Td2eFXTdE4HQjKXvuYcqaE--9ZB3xnJfrJx-8jVe7DNYigb8cuIFWlI During the 1966 season William & Mary was driving for the game winning touchdown.

The Hokies would be a ten point underdog to the Hurricanes. Loria would play a great game defensively as every time a Hurricane running back hit the line Loria was there to meet him. Loria's efforts would allow Virginia Tech to hold Miami to just 16 yards of offense during the 1st half. The Hokies would still lose a heartbreaker 7-14 to the Miami Hurricanes.Fitzgerald P.42 During the 1966 season Loria returned punts 80, 65, and 80 yards for touchdowns.Fitzgerald P.46 Defensively Loria had three interceptions on the year.

It comprises of wetlands, waterways, and other habitats in northeastern Duval County. Managed by the National Park Service in cooperation with the City of Jacksonville and Florida State Parks, it includes natural and historic areas such as the Fort Caroline National Memorial and the Kingsley Plantation. The preserve was established in 1988 and expanded in 1999 by Preservation Project Jacksonville. Background The Fort Caroline National Memorial is located in the Timucuan Preserve, as is the Kingsley Plantation, the oldest standing plantation in the state. The Preserve is maintained through cooperation by the National Park Service, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the City of Jacksonville Department of Parks and Recreation. It is named for the Timucua Indians who had 35 chiefdoms throughout northern Florida and south Georgia at the time of Spanish colonization. Archeological excavation by a University of North Florida team has revealed more information about indigenous peoples in the area. On Black Hammock Island, they have discovered remnants of the second-oldest pottery in the United States, dating to 2500 BCE. (There have been slightly older finds in the Savannah River area.)Matt Soergel, \\"Archaeologists help distinguish Mocama group\\", Morris News Service, 25 Oct 2009, accessed 11 May 2010 They also have excavated more recent artifacts contemporary with the Mocama chiefdom. In the last 25 years, these Native American people have been recognized as distinct from the Timucua, although they spoke a Timucuan dialect. Their chiefdom extended from the St. Johns River to St. Simons Island, Georgia. Archeologists believe they have found evidence of a Spanish mission on the island as well. San Juan del Puerto, one of the oldest Spanish missions in Florida, was established here during the 16th century. Franciscan brothers were missionaries to the Timucua and Guale Indians along the coast, whose territory included the Sea Islands in Georgia and up to the Savannah River. On June 9, 2020, the Preserve gained another 2,500 acres of marshland along the Nassau River from two private land trusts.

The film is loosely based on the true life story of Wendell Scott, the first African American NASCAR race winner and 2015 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductee. Plot In 1930s Danville, Virginia, an African-American boy named Wendell Scott impresses a group of white boys with his bike-riding powers. Fifteen years later, Wendell returns to Danville after serving in the Army during World War II. His family welcomes him home with a party and he takes an immediate liking to a guest, Mary Jones. Later, Wendell tells his mother he does not want to work in the cotton mill and plans to use his muster pay to buy a taxicab, eventually open a garage, and be his own boss. As Wendell and Mary begin dating, Wendell tells Mary's family that his real dream is be a champion racecar driver, but they do not take him seriously. Sometime later, Wendell takes Mary to an old racetrack in his new taxicab to propose, and they make love. Soon after, they are married and move into a house, but Wendell struggles to make money. One day, he sees a bootlegger named Slack and asks for a job. On his first night, he discovers his best friend, Peewee, is already working for Slack and they narrowly evade Sheriff Cotton and his men. Although Wendell is thrilled to drive fast for a living, Mary is not happy with Wendell's new profession. He insists that he tried to make money legally and this is the only way he can buy the garage. Five years later, Sheriff Cotton has still been unable to apprehend Wendell, but he captures Slack in a raid. On Easter Sunday, Wendell takes over one of Slack's runs, but soon realizes it is a set-up when he is arrested. Billy Joe Byrnes, the local automobile racetrack owner, makes Cotton and Wendell a proposition: if Wendell agrees to race at Byrnes' track, twelve of the fifteen charges against him will be dropped, and he will receive probation. All Wendell needs to do is cross the finish line. Byrnes promotes Wendell as the first black stock car driver and on race day, there is a large multiracial crowd. During the contest, the white drivers run Wendell off the track, but he manages to complete the race and secure his freedom. Having discovered his calling, Wendell fixes up his car. At the junkyard, he meets a man named Woodrow, who volunteers to be his mechanic. Mary does not want Wendell to continue racing, but he insists on following his dream. Barred from racing at most tracks, Wendell finally gets a chance, finishes fourth, and is awarded two steak dinners at a \\"whites-only\\" restaurant. A white driver named Hutch accompanies him and they become friends. At the next race, Hutch's car will no longer run and he is forced to give up, so he joins Wendell's team as a mechanic. A few years later, in 1955, Wendell faces off with rival Beau Welles at Middle Virginia Speedway. Wendell wins a close race, but Welles is declared the winner. After the crowd has gone, the race officials admit there was an error, but Wendell is enraged because is denied the trophy and recognition. He encourages Hutch join a bigger team so he can better provide for his family. As years pass, Wendell joins the Grand National circuit, the highest level of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), competing at tracks in Atlanta, Georgia; Darlington, South Carolina; Riverside, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Talladega, Alabama; and Daytona, Florida. By 1965, Wendell is a local celebrity, and Sheriff Cotton visits the Scott home. Cotton is running for Mayor of Danville and he wants a picture with Wendell and the family as a de facto endorsement. Sometime later, Wendell has a serious crash during a Talladega race and is hospitalized. Mary begs her now forty-two-year- old husband to retire, but he is adamant about racing. Later, Wendell enters an important race, and recruits Woodrow, Peewee, and his family and friends, to help him. Wendell goes to the garage of Beau Welles, hoping to buy a used engine and finds Hutch working there. Inspired by Wendell's determination, Hutch quits to rejoin Wendell's team. Back in Danville, Cotton, now mayor, works to secure Wendell sponsors so he can compete with major teams. On the day of the big race, Wendell worries that Mary will not come, but she arrives just before it starts. During the race, Wendell makes a pit stop, but rushes his crew and pulls away with three lug nuts missing from one tire. For the remaining twenty laps, Wendell attempts to make up time on the leader, Beau Welles, as his tire wobbles precariously. As Wendell passes Welles with one lap to go he earns his first NASCAR victory and his family and friends surround him in celebration.

Written by Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain and directed by Skip Schoolnik, it was originally broadcast on April 14, 2004 on the WB television network. In \\"Underneath\\", Angel, Spike and Gunn find the exiled Lindsey in a suburban hell dimension to bring him back to Earth to interrogate him on what he knows about the Senior Partners' plans for the upcoming apocalypse. Meanwhile, a well- dressed, deadly stranger named Marcus Hamilton infiltrates Wolfram & Hart looking for Eve, and a grief-stricken Wesley withdraws into drinking while trying to ‘domesticate’ the evil but confused Illyria to the ways of Earth. Plot Angel and Spike attempt to have a board meeting, but they are the only ones who show up, as the entire office is grief-stricken over Fred's death. They reminisce about Fred, and discuss the impending apocalypse and Angel says that the Senior Partners are planning something. He does not want to wait for them to do something, so Spike suggests finding a link to them. The two head to Eve’s apartment, but she will not help them. Eve berates Angel for letting the Senior Partners take Lindsey. Angel notes that Eve is hiding from the Senior Partners because they will take her if they find out where she is. As the building starts shaking, Eve blames Angel, thinking he told the Senior Partners where she is. The protective symbols in the apartment dissolve, and Eve says that she will tell him anything he wants to know if he takes her with him. As a man in a suit (Adam Baldwin) arrives, Angel, Spike and Eve flee to Wolfram and Hart. They ask Gunn if he has jurisdiction to protect Eve. Gunn reveals that Angel, as CEO, can invoke an order to protect Eve. In his apartment, Wesley has a dream about Fred. When he wakes up, Illyria is with him. They both confess they do not like the world and she wonders why he is still in it. Lindsey could give them more information, but the Senior Partners imprisoned him. Lorne says Eve was being sincere when he read her. Angel wants to know what Lindsey knows about the Senior Partners, but Spike points out that they will have a hard time figuring out which hell dimension Lindsey is in. Angel, Spike, and Gunn head to the garage and get in a Camaro that drives itself. Gunn tells them they have to find the Wrath, which they need to go through to return to Wolfram & Hart. Believing their story to be a neighbor-inspired joke, Lindsey tells them to leave. Angel removes a necklace Lindsey is wearing, breaking the spell Lindsey is under. As they try to leave, Lindsey's wife and son open fire with uzis. They make a run for the Camaro, but it is gone. Gunn suggests trying to get out through the basement, but Lindsey refuses. At Wolfram & Hart, Eve worries that the Senior Partners will not honor the CEO-protection arrangement. In the hell dimension, the team discovers the basement is a torture chamber. Angel finds a flaming furnace and thinks it might be the Wrath. Lindsey notes that \\"he\\" is coming, and the guys see a demon. Spike and Angel fight the Wrath, but are losing badly. Gunn puts on Lindsey’s necklace, saying, \\"If one leaves, one has to stay. A void is impossible.\\" Angel realizes that Gunn knew about the Wrath and wanted to atone for Fred’s death. Gunn tells them they must leave before he forgets, as the door will close. At Wolfram & Hart, Harmony tries to kill the man in the suit by breaking his neck, but the man throws Harmony off. Lorne starts to warn Angel about the guy in the suit, but realizes Gunn has not returned. The man in the suit arrives, pulls out Eve's contract, and has her sign it. He introduces himself as Marcus Hamilton, the new liaison to the Senior Partners. Eve has signed over her immortality and duties to him. Hamilton tells Angel that the Senior Partners are 100% behind him, and welcomes Spike to the team. In Angel’s apartment, Lorne pulls bullets out of Spike as Lindsey and Eve cuddle, happy to be reunited. Angel tells Lindsey he will go into the holding facilities of Wolfram & Hart after he tells Angel and the group what he knows about the Senior Partners' plans. Lindsey talks about Earth being Hell, which is how Wolfram & Hart thrives. Angel says he has already heard that speech. Lindsey tells Angel the apocalypse has been around them even before Angel and his friends came to work at Wolfram & Hart, and Angel has not seen it. Acting After guest starring as Harmony in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel for over six years, Mercedes McNab joins the regular cast and is added to the opening credits. The credits are also edited to show Amy Acker's character more prominently as Illyria. Adam Baldwin had previously appeared as Jayne Cobb in Joss Whedon's series Firefly. Baldwin is the third Firefly main cast member to be recast as a villain in another Joss Whedon series, following Nathan Fillion's role as Caleb in Season 7 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and that of Gina Torres as Jasmine in Season 4 of Angel. Production In an essay exploring Illyria's postmodern identity, Jennifer A. Hudson feels that Wesley's dream suggests that Fred still exists through her connection with Illyria. The dream - in which Fred says \\"This is only the first layer. Don’t you wanna see how deep I go?\\" - may be intended to reveal that Fred's \\"subliminal energy\\" has been consumed and deposited deep in Illyria’s unconscious as \\"potential energy, ready to be activated and unleashed at any given time.\\" The scene in the beginning with Lorne sitting in a bar reading a client was added, because the episode would have been too short otherwise.DVD commentary References External links * * Category:Angel (season 5) episodes Category:2004 American television episodes ","title":"Underneath (Angel)"},{"id":"3650223","text":"Manuel Rendón Seminario (b. Paris, 1894 - d. Portugal, 1982) (Also known by Manuel Rendón) was a master Latin American painter credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement to Ecuador and Latin America together with Joaquín Torres García who brought the Constructivist Movement to his home country of Uruguay. The Constructivist Movement was started in Russia by Vladimir Tatlin around 1913. Rendón studied at the Académie of the Grand Chaumière in Paris, however, he resisted formal art training centers and instead preferred a solitary, assiduous, and tenacious work destiny. At an early age Rendon's work was regularly exhibited in the Paris Halls. Although Rendón was born in Paris, he is the son of Ecuadorian parents and is often considered an Ecuadorian artist who lived the majority of his life in Ecuador. Rendon's father, Víctor Manuel Rendón, acted as an ambassador in Paris. Early in his career, Rendón lived the Boehemian life of a Parisian artist struggling to earn money. Rendón would sell small works made out of copper in order to make money to paint. In 1937, Rendón exhibited in Guayaquil, Ecuador and in Quito in 1939. These exhibits had an enormous impact on the great masters living in these cities at the time. The works were modern and abstract in nature. Rendón preached, \\"the task of the painter is to organize the possibilities that are offered to him.\\" The work of Manuel Rendón is vast and has greatly influenced generations of master artists throughout Latin America and Europe, such as Antoni Tàpies, Antonio Saura, Enrique Tábara, Estuardo Maldonado, Carlos Catasse, Félix Arauz, Aníbal Villacís, Oswaldo Viteri and Theo Constanté, to name a few.

It has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride. It includes Hunt's Tomb, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description View from the Phoenix Zoo entrance Papago Park is a hilly desert park covering 1200 acres in its Phoenix extent and 296 acres in its Tempe extent. Tempe refers to its section of the park specifically as Tempe Papago Park. Papago Park is notable for its many distinctive geological formations and its wide variety of typical desert plants, including the giant saguaro cactus. The park also features the Desert Botanical Garden, a large zoo (the Phoenix Zoo), picnic areas, several small lakes, hiking trails, bicycle paths, a fire museum, and Hunt's Tomb, the pyramidal tomb of Arizona's first governor, George W. P. Hunt. Tempe Papago Park includes baseball and softball fields, picnic ramadas, a small lake, and other features.

Gart, 1996 The park includes the home baseball and softball stadium for North Pointe Preparatory. History Hole in the Rock Inside Hole in the Rock Sandra Day O'Connor's House. O'Connor's house was moved from the town of Paradise Valley, Ariz., to Papago Park. The distinctive red sandstone geological formations of Papago Park were formed some 6-15 million years ago. One such formation, Hole-in-the- Rock, is a major landmark, thanks to the openings (tafoni) eroded in the formation over time. There is some evidence that the Hohokam--a now-extinct aboriginal tribe that once lived in the Phoenix area--used the openings and sunlight to track the solstices. There are also some signs of Precambrian granite in the park. The bedrock is concealed by only a thin layer of topsoil. Papago Park was designated a reservation for the local Maricopa and Pima tribes of aboriginal Americans in 1879. It became the Papago-Saguaro National Monument in 1914, but this status was recalled by Congress, April 7, 1930, because the area was not considered suitable for a national monument.Arizona Place Names, Will C Barnes, U of A Press, page 317 It was divided amongst the state of Arizona, the city of Tempe and the Water Users Association, later known as the Salt River Project. The Federal government reserved all oil, coal or other mineral rights. Following the onset of the Great Depression, Governor Hunt commissioned a bass fish hatchery to be established in Papago Park during 1932. The hatchery was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project, and became successful, stocking largemouth bass and other fish for Arizona's waterways. During World War II, Papago Park housed a POW camp and contained as many as 3,100 prisoners from 1942 to 1944. It was also the site of the largest mass escape from any United States prison camp in World War II. The Great Papago Escape occurred on December 23, 1944 when 25 prisoners, including German U-boat commander Jürgen Wattenberg, escaped the camp using a 178-foot tunnel and made their way to the Arizona desert. Many prisoners quickly realized that they knew nothing about the landscape or climate and turned themselves back in. Wattenberg was the last to be captured, on January 28, 1945.uboat.net webpage on Jürgen Wattenberg After the war the POW camp site served as a VA hospital from 1947 to 1951, then an Army Reserve facility. The state-owned portion of Papago Park was sold to the city of Phoenix on February 25, 1959. The fish hatchery was also shut down in 1959, as it was considered obsolete by that time. The City of Phoenix leased the hatchery grounds, including its man-made lakes, to the Arizona Zoological Society in 1962 to establish the Phoenix Zoo. A small stone cottage, used as the hatchery caretaker's residence, was retained as part of the zoo, and extensively renovated in the 1990s. A portion of the Tempe park was conveyed to that city in 1935, and a parcel within that portion was conveyed to the Salt River Project in 1955. An 18-hole championship golf course was built by the city of Phoenix and completed in 1963. The park was also the Finish Line in the fourth season of The Amazing Race. Hunt's Tomb Hunt's Tomb is a small white pyramid behind a fence at the top of a hill within Papago Park. George W.P. Hunt (Arizona's 1st governor) had the tomb built in 1931 to entomb his wife.

Plot synopsis Gunn is still trapped in the suburban hell dimension, with no memory of his normal life, and doomed to suffer eternal torment at the hands of a torture demon. Marcus Hamilton, the new liaison to the Senior Partners, shows up and offers to remove Gunn from Hell in exchange for his soul. Gunn refuses to even listen to Hamilton's offer, and resumes his own torture at the hands of the demon. The main storyline concerns Connor, who is now happily living the life of a normal teenager. Connor's adoptive parents, the Reillys, bring him in to Wolfram & Hart after a van hits him and he emerges unscathed; they are concerned for his welfare, and had heard of the law firm's reputation for solving odd cases. Angel, however, is furious at the idea that Connor might again be exposed to the supernatural, and initially refuses to help. However, when a trio of demons attacks Connor and his parents, Angel accepts the case. Despite Connor's obliviousness to their connection, Angel enjoys seeing his son as a happy, prosperous kid, but the investigation into the demon attack leads Angel to an elderly and powerful demon sorcerer named Cyvus Vail—the man responsible for creating the new reality in which Connor leads the life of a normal teenager. Vail explains that the demon attack was supposed to fail, and its purpose was merely to attract Connor's attention. Vail reveals that his real motivation is an ancient prophecy that identifies Connor as the only person able to kill Vail's old enemy, the demon warrior Sahjhan (imprisoned in his urn since episode \\"Forgiving\\" in Season 3). Vail demands that Connor kill Sahjhan, and in return, he will allow him to resume his normal life. Meanwhile, Wesley continues to study Illyria and her super abilities with Spike, who serves as Illyria's \\"punching bag\\" in an attempt to determine her weaknesses. Wesley explains to Illyria that Angel has earned their loyalty, but Wes begins to change his mind when he grows suspicious of Angel's seemingly odd behavior concerning the Connor Reilly case. Wesley's investigation leads to Vail, and records indicating that he had been hired by Wolfram & Hart to cast a massive, reality-changing spell on the day that the law firm was taken over by Angel Investigations. Angel aggravates these suspicions by refusing to offer an explanation, and Wesley begins to theorize that Angel's behavior may be a result of guilt; specifically that Angel had sacrificed Fred in exchange for control of Wolfram & Hart, and then paid Vail to erase everyone's memories of the deal. At Vail's house, Connor and Sahjhan engage in a fight to the death, as a helpless Angel is mystically prevented from aiding his son in the battle. Accompanied by Illyria, Wesley confronts Angel with his theory that Vail's spell is responsible for Fred's death, and impulsively destroys the magical Orlon Window that contains a true copy of previously altered memories. As a result, Connor, Wesley, and Illyria quickly regain their lost memories of the previous reality. Connor, who had been losing his fight with Sahjhan, regains his old fighting skills and manages to kill Sahjhan. However, despite a brief return to his old, defiant personality during the battle, Connor manages to retain the emotional stability created by Vail's reality alteration spell. Back at the office, Illyria mocks Wesley for accusing Angel of betrayal when in fact, Wesley had betrayed Angel by stealing his son thus causing the chain of events that ultimately compelled Angel to accept Wolfram & Hart's offers and resulted in Fred's death. Wesley is visibly shaken by this revelation but he is resolved to endure the truth. Connor returns to his adoptive family but not before he tells Angel that he learned to protect his family 'from my father', giving Angel a knowing glance.

Wesley breaks the spell, restoring his, Illyria's, and Connor's memories of the events of the past two years and Connor's entire life. Connor does not directly reveal to Angel that he also regained his memories (which 'melded' with his own), but it is heavily implied. When Connor returns for the finale episode, \\"Not Fade Away\\", this is fully explained. *Spike and Illyria interact, sparring so that he can test her strength. This dynamic is further explored in the rest of the season and later in the canonical comic book series Angel: After the Fall's tie-in, Spike: After the Fall. *Cyvus Vail makes his first appearance, eventually to return in \\"Power Play.\\" =Continuity= *The reasoning behind Sahjahn's grudge against Angel and motives towards killing his son are explored; he and Connor fight, and Sahjahn is killed. Knowing that Sahjahn, not Angel, is directly responsible for his plight in Quor'Toth and other related events gives Connor the strength to reconciles with his father in \\"Not Fade Away\\". In the canonical comic book series Angel & Faith, sees that the pair finally acknowledge each other as father and son. *Hamilton makes references to Angel and Eve's sexual encounter in \\"Life of the Party\\". *When Connor meets Illyria, he mentions he always had a thing for older women, to which Angel mutters under his breath, \\"They were supposed to fix that,\\" thus revealing that part of Angel's deal is also had Wolfram & Hart to rid what he finds unpleasant socially on Connor but failed. This refers to Connor's relationship with Jasmine, who possessed Cordelia at the time. * This episode marks the only time Connor and Spike appear in the same scene together. In Angel: After the Fall and its tie-ins, revealing Spike's knowledge of Connor's parentage thus each other's relations in vampire bloodline, indicating that Spike had learned about Connor at some point off- screen after this episode.

Following a suggestion by Ferdinand Piëch, the position of the driver was moved from the traditional left (as in German road cars) to the right as this gives advantages on the predominant clockwise race tracks. With a new longtail body, the 907s reached 302 km/h (190 mph) on the straight, even though it used the reliable 220 hp Porsche 910 2000cc 6-cyl rather than the more powerful 8-cyl. Vented brake disks were being used as standard from that point on. The best Porsche 907 finished 5th, beaten only by Ford and Ferrari with their much bigger engines. As the record-breaking performances of the 7.0l V8-powered Ford had triggered rumors about a future rule change, Porsche started to prepare themselves in summer of 1967. The 907 was equipped with the 270 hp 2200cc Type 771/1 8-cyl which was then modified for the rules of the new 3 litre prototype category that was announced in late 1967 to come in effect already in 1968. An engine with the full 3000cc would have to be developed first, though, to be introduced in the future Porsche 908.  1968  From 1968, the big V8 and V12 prototypes of Ford and Ferrari were banned, and Porsche hoped to secure the World Sportscar Championship and maybe an overall win at Le Mans as the competition at Ford, Matra and Alfa Romeo was not prepared with suitable 3000cc prototypes yet, either. Ferrari even sat out the whole of 1968 as a protest against the rule change. Apart from the former 2000cc-class rivals Alfa Romeo T33/2 and Renault-powered Alpine, 5000cc sportscars were also permitted to enter if at least 50 of them had been built. This loophole was intended to fill the grid with cars dating mainly from 1965, like Ford GT40 and Lola T70. Porsche was serious. Unlike during the rather modest earlier years, four cars were entered in the 1968 24 Hours of Daytona, supported by 20 mechanics and engineers. The drivers wore cooling vests developed by NASA as the oil-cooler and the hot oil pipes caused heat in the closed cockpit. After the #53 car of Gerhard Mitter had a big crash caused by tyre failure in the banking, his teammate Rolf Stommelen supported the #54 driven by Vic Elford/Jochen Neerpasch. When the #52 car of the longtime leaders Jo Siffert/Hans Herrmann dropped to second due to a technical problem, these two also drove on the #54 car in case theirs broke down. Due to this, five pilots won the race, and two of them scored also second. The #51 Jo Schlesser/Joe Buzzetta car completed the 1-2-3 side-by-side parade finish that the Ferrari prototypes had shown a year earlier at the banked finish line. The three Alfa Romeo T33/2's were even beaten by a Ford Mustang. The 1968 12 Hours of Sebring saw a 1-2 finish for the Porsche 907, with the Jo Siffert/Hans Herrmann car winning and the Vic Elford/Jochen Neerpasch car finishing 2nd. The Gerhard Mitter/Rolf Stommelen and Ludovico Scarfiotti/Joe Buzzetta cars were victims of engine failures. Daytona & Sebring marked the first back-to- back major outright wins for the company, and French journalist (and occasional racer) Bernard Cahier wrote, \\"it's hard to imagine that anyone could beat Porsche to the championship this year.\\" Their championship hopes in Sportscars and F1 would be significantly changed soon, though. The next race was the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch, on April 7, 1968. That fateful day, Jim Clark was supposed to drive one of the new Ford F3L P68 prototypes with the Cosworth DFV engine, entered by Alan Mann Racing. Clark instead was driving a Formula 2 at Hockenheimring to show the new sponsorship logos for Team Lotus, and was killed. Jo Siffert/Hans Herrmann were fastest in qualifying ahead of Bruce McLaren/Mike Spence in the new Ford, but none finished. It was the updated John Wyer-entered Ford GT40 of Jacky Ickx/Brian Redman which won ahead of the remaining two Porsche 907's after being only 5th on the grid. In races on faster tracks like the 1000km Monza, these modified old Ford GT40's entered by JWA Gulf Racing Team proved to be an unexpectedly strong force. The loophole for these 5-liter sportscars was opened if at least 50 were built, to let the many existing Lola T70's take part, too. For 1969, the minimum number was lowered to 25, which opened opportunities unexpected by many. At the twisty Targa Florio, the only privately entered GT40 finished last, but the Alfa Romeo T33/2 were strong. In lap 1, Vic Elford had lost 18 minutes due to a tyre failure. Supported by veteran Umberto Maglioli, he showed a fantastic race in the 907, reminiscent of Juan Manuel Fangio's legendary 1957 German Grand Prix, beating the old lap record by one minute and winning by 3 minutes. Hans Herrmann & Jochen Neerpasch came in 4th among four Alfas. In the Porsche advertising poster celebrating the win, only an exhausted yet smiling Elford was shown, not the cars as usual. The 1000km Nürburgring was won with the new Porsche 908 with its 3000cc engine, but it still was unreliable. The underpowered 2200cc 907 with less than half the Ford's displacement continued as Porsche's best entry in the 1000km Spa, Watkins Glen 6 Hours and 500km Zeltweg, losing to the Ford GT40's. This set up the stage for a showdown at la Sarthe, as due to political unrest in France, the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans had been postponed from its traditional mid-June date to the end of September. Porsche could not take advantage of the additional time to improve the 908 nor read the French rule book properly. For the first time, Porsche were the fastest in qualifying and the early stages of the race, but troubles with the 908's alternator caused delays and even disqualifications as the new Porsche staff had misinterpreted the repair rules. For the third time in a row, a V8-powered Ford won the 24h classic. A Porsche 907LH came in second in front of the sole surviving 908. In addition, Ford had taken the World Sportscar Championship, too. At that time, Porsche had already decided to make a risky investment in order to go one step further beyond the 3-liter 908 prototype: they committed themselves to develop a new 5-liter sportscar and built the required number of 25 in advance. This car was the legendary Porsche 917.  1969 - 1971  During the following seasons, several 907s were entered by privateers, scoring occasional top-10 finishes, with a podium at Monza in 1969 and a 7th at the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans being the more remarkable results.

His father was an abolitionist and a member of Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, but died (as did his wife) when this John Hunn was a boy. The young orphan and his siblings were raised by relatives, and his sister later convinced him to become a minister.Berry p. His half brother Ezekiel Hunn Jr. would be apprenticed to Philadelphia Quaker merchant Townsend Sharpless, whose daughter he would marry and who would later donate some papers to Swarthmore College.http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/friends/ead/5070hunn.xml Meanwhile, John Hunn decided to marry Mary Swallow, who was not a Quaker, and was accordingly expelled from his Camden, Delaware meeting, although the Quakers relented and Mary converted to the faith, so they were allowed to transfer their membership to another meeting near their farm, \\"Happy Valley,\\" near Middletown, Kent County, Delaware.Berry p. Their marriage survived until her death, and they had several children, as well as became stalwarts of the Appoquinimink meeting. Among their children was John, later the Governor of Delaware. After Mary's death, John Hunn remarried, to Anne Jenkins. Abolitionist Assisted by his relative John Alston and Daniel Corbit of the rural area encompassing Middletown, in Kent County and Odessa in New Castle County, Delaware, as well as by Thomas Garrett and others in Wilmington further north in New Castle County, Hunn was responsible for a portion of the Underground Railroad network that transported thousands of escapees up the Delmarva Peninsula to Wilmington and thence to Pennsylvania and freedom.Eric Foner, Gateway to Freedom: the Hidden History of the Underground Railroad (W.W. Norton & Co. 2015) p. 156 In December 1845 he helped freedman Samuel Hawkins escape with his enslaved family of seven (owned by 2 masters) from slavery in Maryland. Although the slavecatchers caught the family on Hunn's farm, the local sheriff noticed a defect in the paperwork, and early in 1846 Delaware Supreme Court justice James Booth Jr. freed them based on a writ of habeas corpus sought by a fellow abolitionist (and lawyer) James Wales, and Thomas Garrett quickly called a coach to take them across the border into Pennsylvania. The displeased slaveholders then sued Hunn and Garrett for violating the Fugitive Slave Act in the U.S. District Court in the New Castle Court House. After a trial presided over by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney and District Judge Willard Hall, both Hunn and Garrett were convicted and fined heavily.Accounts of the actual fines vary. See http://www.whispersofangels.com/biographies.html.

Although his family was left utterly destitute, Hunn continued his efforts to abolish slavery. Following this eviction, he lived for a time with relatives in Magnolia in Kent County. During the Civil War, Hunn could not serve in the military because of his faith, but afterward moved with his family to the Sea Islands of South Carolina to work with the Freedmen's Bureau in Port Royal, South Carolina and as a customs officer in Beaufort, South Carolina.https://history.delaware.gov/freedom/people_hunn.shtml 1873 U.S., Register of Civil, Military, and Naval Service, Vol. I (Treasury Dept./Customs) p. 184, available on ancestry.com Death and legacy Hunn died July 6, 1894 at Camden in Kent County, where he was living with his son John Hunn Jr. (who had moved back to Delaware in 1876 and later became Delaware's governor) and is buried at the Camden Friends Meetinghouse.http://www.findagrave.com no.7782424 Because of his modesty, or to protect others from possible retaliation as interracial tensions remained high, on his deathbed, this Hunn asked his son John to burn his papers, although some were retained by other correspondents, including William Still in Philadelphia, who published an account of some of Hunn's activities.Berry p. http://mdiggins.com/blog-freedom-seekers-and-freedom-stealers-along-the- mason-dixon-line/john-hunn-recounts-the-escape-of-molly The ancestral Hunn home, Wildcat Manor, is now part of a mostly-nature park (\\"Hunn Park\\") administered by Kent County Parks and Recreation.http://www.doverpost.com/news/20160420/trail-through-time-hunn- park-comes-back-from- brownfieldshttps://www.c-span.org/video/?313938-1/wildcat-manor A loop of the federal Underground Railroad historic trail in Delaware visits sites associated with Hunn and his father (who assisted Harriet Tubman).

The town is located near a crossing on the upper Murray River. Across the river on the Victorian side are the nearby towns of Walwa and Tintaldra. The Bridge Hotel at Jingellic is well known in the district. Below the hotel is a camping ground on the banks of the river. History European settlers grazed cattle on the banks of Murray at Jingellic from the 1830s. The first land grants were issued in the 1840s and 1850s. Jingellic Post Office opened on 15 September 1883. In 1920 a butter factory was established. With the decline of the dairy industry it closed in 1963. Each year in early March Jingellic hosts its annual agricultural show. The show centres around equestrian competition. It also features some cattle (and formerly sheep) judging, a pavilion, and entertainment in the form of amusement rides. The show began in 1927. The bridge was begun in 1887 but not opened until 1892. Once the bridge was opened, a customs house was built on the Victorian side and operated until 1915 from which time customs dues were no longer an issue. Apparently locals continued to use the nearby Horse Creek ford for smuggling. When the new bridge was constructed in 1959, it bypassed the town. The remains of the old bridge are seen as significant by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority as \\"a representative example of a method of bridge building which is no longer used. It is one of several identifiable stages of bridge building along the Murray.\\" The remnants of the old bridge are upstream of the present bridge and the hotel. The remnants consist of steel or iron trestles standing in the river without any superstructure. The present bridge is a steel truss bridge with ten approach spans; seven on the NSW side and three on the Victorian side.

Floppy disks =Background= Fast loaders came about because of a discrepancy between the actual speed at which floppy drives could transfer data and the speed that was provided by the operating system's default routines. This discrepancy was most pronounced on the Commodore VIC-20 and 64. While the earlier Commodore PET series had used an industry-standard IEEE-488 parallel bus, this was replaced with a custom Commodore serial bus on the VIC-20. The serial bus was intended to be nearly as fast as its predecessor, due to the use of the 6522 VIA as a hardware shift register on both the drive and computer. However, hardware bugs were discovered in the 6522 that prevented this function from working consistently. As a result, the KERNAL ROM routines were hastily rewritten to transfer a single bit at a time, using a slow software handshaking protocol. Although the C64 replaced the 6522 VIA with two 6526 CIA chips, which did not suffer from this bug, the companion 1541 disk drive still had a 6522 VIA. Commodore chose not to redesign the 1541 hardware, also in order to retain backward compatibility with VIC-20 peripherals; this however came at the expense of speed. Because of the transfer protocol, the Commodore 1540 and 1541 disk drives soon gained a reputation for extreme slowness. Only at the introduction of the Commodore 128 computer and the Commodore 1571 disk drive was the original plan put into action and a hardware shift register was used, reducing the need for special fast loaders. =Development= Soon after the C64's release, some astute programmers realized that Commodore's bit-banging serial KERNAL routines were unnecessarily sluggish. Since the CPU in the C64 ran at approximately the same speed as that in the 1541 disk drive, it was sufficient to synchronize only at the beginning of each byte, rather than at each individual bit. Moreover, this transfer method allowed two bits to be sent simultaneously, one over the standard \`DATA\` line and one over the \`CLK\` line (which was normally used to perform the handshaking). On the C64, this required very careful timing to avoid interference from interrupts and from the VIC-II graphics chip, which could \\"steal\\" CPU cycles. Some fast loaders disabled interrupts and blanked the screen for this reason. A fast loader would generally \\"wedge\\" itself into the \`LOAD\` vector at \`$0330\`, thus intercepting any calls to the KERNAL \`LOAD\` routine. Next, the fast loader would transfer the necessary code into the drive RAM and order its execution, then receive the file sent by the altered transfer code. Depending on the exact nature of the routines used, the loading speed could be improved by as much as a factor of five. This technique was used for a few of the many fast-load systems made (such as JiffyDOS). Others were simply more efficient in I/O and file handling, offering marginal to good improvement. Other products added parallel hardware. =Commercial fast loaders= Various software companies released fast loaders for the C64, usually in cartridge form. In the United States, probably the most popular such cartridge was the Epyx FastLoad. Most fast loader cartridges also incorporated other features to increase ease of use. An on-board implementation of Commodore's DOS Wedge was included in most fast loader cartridges. Machine language monitors, disk editors, and various convenience commands for Commodore BASIC were also common additions. Some fast loader cartridges were very sophisticated, incorporating a reset button, \\"freeze\\" capabilities, and a simple onboard GUI. The Final Cartridge III was perhaps the most successful of this genre. A few commercial fast loaders, most notably CMD's JiffyDOS, were not cartridge-driven but instead replaced the KERNAL ROM in the C64 and the DOS ROM in the 1541. While these were more difficult to install, they offered greatly increased compatibility, being almost invisible to software running on the machine. The cartridge, Action Replay MK6 RAM loader loads a 202 block program in around 9 seconds. Its Warp loader is 25 times faster, but programs can only be loaded with a loader saved to disk when the cartridge is not present. Whereas the ARMK6 fastloader was compatible with most software, The Final Cartridge III was known to crash often, so programs had to be loaded in normal C64 mode, deactivating the cartridge, making it more or less useless. Many commercial programs for the C64, especially games, contained their own fast-loading routines on the distribution media. The user would load a small \\"stub\\" program from the disk with the standard slow routines, which would then install faster transfer routines in both the computer and the drive before proceeding to load the rest of the program at high speed. This way, the user benefited from the fast loader without having to buy or know about a dedicated fast-loader product. =Type-in fast loaders= Several popular Commodore magazines published type-in fast loading software. In April 1985, Compute! published TurboDisk, a fast loader that included C64 and VIC-20 versions. This program proved popular and was republished in the July 1985 issue of Compute!'s Gazette. It was printed yet again in August 1986, without the VIC-20 version, but with several accompanying utilities to relocate the program in memory and to create auto- booting software that took advantage of TurboDisk's speed. A Commodore 128 version was also included for those C128 users who still had 1541 disk drives. COMPUTE!'s Gazette also published several other utilities that speed up C64-to-1541 communications, including Turbo Copy (a 4-minute full-disk copier), TurboSave (a utility that accelerated the speed of disk saves) and Quick! (another fast loader). RUN Magazine published Sizzle! in December 1987, an integrated package that included a relocatable fast loader with autoboot generation capability. BYTE published Loader, a machine-language fast-loading software for Apple DOS 3.3, in November 1983. Compute! published TurboDisk for DOS 3.3 in October 1986. The type-in fast loader fashion continued in the age of the Internet. Krill's Loader (2009) and Spindle (2013) are two examples of C64-to-1541 \\"IRQ loaders\\", fast loaders that allow programs (mainly games) to keep their own IRQs during loading. With modern loaders the slow rate of GCR decoding proved to be the bottleneck, and modern loaders all carry their own optimized routines for such. Cassette tapes The built-in routines for storing and reading data to and from Compact Cassette tapes was made for safe storing rather than speed. Better tape-quality in the 1980s made it possible to store data more effectively, reducing loading time and tape length. Such programs existed for several computers, such as the Ohio Scientific Challenger. The PET Rabbit was one such program for the PET, while TurboTape was one for the Commodore Datassette. Turbo 2000 was a similar system for the Atari. Invade-a-Load was a fast loader for cassette-based games which not only accelerated the loading of blocks from the tape, but also contained a mini- game (in this case, a clone of Space Invaders) that could be played while waiting for the main game to finish loading.

Administered at the federal level by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture, NAIS will also be overseen by state animal health boards. While the federal program is voluntary, money received by some states, tribes, and non-profit entities from the USDA through cooperative agreements has been used to make parts or all of the program mandatory. Critics claim the system will put small farmers out of business, by requiring that farmers pay the cost of registration devices of between $1 and $20 for each animal. Large, corporate factory farms which are connected to vertically integrated, birth-to-death factory systems ID and pay by the herd (and not the individual animal), while small farmers must pay it for each animal. Overview The National Animal Identification System covers most livestock species, including cattle, poultry, horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, goats and swine, as well as bison, deer, elk, llamas, alpacas and even some fish species, under the heading of aquaculture. Household pets such as cats and dogs are not included. The first step in the system is identification of locations, or premises, where these animals are housed or otherwise handled, while identification of the individual animals is the second component. The final part of the program is to track animal movement between the various premises. The USDA claims the ultimate goal of NAIS is traceback within 48 hours of a diseased animal's movements, which would be possible once the three components of NAIS are fully implemented. This traceback would enable animal health officials to identify all the animals and locations that have had direct contact with the animal and take appropriate measures to prevent the further spread of disease. =Premises identification number= Premises identification, the first part of NAIS, allows certain information about each premises be entered into a national database, along with a unique, 7-character premises identification number. Information will include: the assigned premises identification number; the name of the premises; its owner or another appropriate contact person; its location, including the street address, city, state, and zip code; a contact phone number; the type of operation, such as a slaughterhouse or horse boarding stable; the date the premises ID number was activated; and the date that the premises ID number was deactivated, along with the reason. =Animal identification= The next step is animal identification. Each individual animal, whether horse, cow, sheep, chicken, pigeon, etc., is given a unique, 15-character animal identification number, or, in the case of animals that remain together in groups, a unique, 13-character group identification number. The technology to be used for identification has not yet been finally chosen, although some recommendations have been made by the different species working groups, which represent animal producers. Radio frequency identification (RFID), such as that found in microchips, retinal scanning, and DNA samples are among the possibilities. =Animal tracking= The final component of NAIS is animal tracking. This would allow a report to be filed each time one of a set of events occurs, such as a change of an animal's ownership or movement to a new premises. A report would include the animal's or group's identification number, the premises identification number where the event took place, the date of the event, and the type of event, as slaughter or a sighting of the animal. In 2004, the U.S. Government asked farmers to use EID or Electronic Identification ear tags on all their cattle. This request was part of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) spurred by the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Due to poor performance and concern that other people could access their confidential information, only about 30 percent of cattle producers in the United States tried using EID tags using standards based on the low frequency standards, while the UHF standards are being mandated for use in Brazil, Paraguay, and Korea .EID Tags - The Next Generation , CattleIdentification.org On December 19, 2007, the FDA announced plans to create a database to track cloned animals through the food system and enable an effective labeling process. This system will be part of the National Animal Identification System, which will track all livestock in the United States from farm to fork. Benefits NAIS has the ability to make American animal products more marketable overseas. Some countries have restricted the importation of some animal products because of the potential for disease. The European Union doesn't require trading-partner countries to fulfill its traceability requirements, though the EU says common practice among some of its food-business operators is to ask for trading partners to comply with regulation as part of contractual agreements. Concerns Some of the concerns with NAIS include financial, civil rights, and religious aspects of the program. =Financial costs= Financially, a system as vast as NAIS could be extremely costly. Additionally, there is concern that the costs of complying with the program will drive small farmers out of business, due to the cost associated with registering each animal. Small farmers and families that sell off parts of their herds or flocks every year would have to register and pay a registration fee for every head of livestock or poultry, while corporate farms with large herds or flocks that move through the production chain as a group, will only have to pay the fee equivalent of owning one animal. In this scenario most of the costs of this expensive tracking system will fall on small farms and families, allowing corporate farms increased profits and lower costs. According to the USDA's NAIS User Guide (p27), the cost of the various animal identification devices ranges from as little as $1 to as much as $20. For example, as indicated in that guide, an RFID ear tag costs from $2 to $3, while implantable transponders can cost up to $20, plus associated veterinarian costs. Consider the family chicken farmer, who will have to place a $1 visual tag on each chicken, while the corporate farmer will have to tag only one chicken in each flock, giving the corporate farmer a $1 cost savings per chicken, over the family farmer. This disparity will further tip the scales in favor of corporate farms and give them greater ability to out-compete smaller farms, hastening the demise of the small family farm. The costs of becoming NAIS compliant for a U.S. beef producer were found to be a minimum of $2.08 a head for large producers and as much as $17.56 a head for smaller operations, with an estimated average cost to cow/calf producers of $6.26 per animal, according to research by Christopher Raphael Crosby of Kansas State University's Department of Agricultural Economics published in 2008. A spreadsheet developed by Kansas State University agricultural economist Kevin C. Dhuyvetter and beef specialist Dale Blasi to calculate the costs of a RFID-based animal identification system, published in July 2005, puts the costs at $7.21 per head for a herd of 250 cattle, based on variables including the cost of tags and hardware such as readers and computers.http://www.agmanager.info/livestock/budgets/production/beef/RFID%20costs.xls Unfortunately this is very deceiving since the average livestock herd is actually only about 15 animals raising the cost per animal to over $50. This produces a large bias of benefit towards the big producers and harms small local farms who bear an undue burden for a program that gives them little to no benefit. =Civil rights concerns= There are also civil rights concerns, because NAIS establishes extensive government control over livestock, which are considered to be private property. There are also concerns that the big agribusiness companies will use this system to blame their mistakes in processing which introduces contamination to the food supply on small farmers, putting them out of business. In Wisconsin, the first state to make NAIS mandatory by allowing Premises ID to become law in January 2006, there is the ability to allow for exemptions of small farms. However, this has been denied by the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) in their rule making. Wisconsin State Statute 95.51 (3m)states that the department may promulgate exemptions based on size and type of farm, ATCP rule No. 17 makes Premises ID completely mandatory and offers no exemptions. Although DATCP Secretary Rod Nilsestuen said in a May 1, 2007 press release that Premises ID is not Animal ID, he does not deny that in September 2005 he wrote to the US House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Livestock and Horticulture (serial number 109-16) that he and DATCP \\"support the use of RFID technology in all livestock species as deemed effective and appropriate by the NAIS Species Working Groups.\\" Other concerns in Wisconsin and other states (who contract with WLIC) is that the system is not maintained by state government, but instead relies upon the Wisconsin Livestock Identification Consortium (WLIC) to maintain the database of Premises ID registrants. This is currently continuing with the RFID tagging database as well. The WLIC is a private interest group made up of Big Agribusiness, including Cargill, Genetics/Biotech Corporations, like ABS Global, and RFID tagging companies such as Digital Angel, and many of these members parallel NIAA membership. There are also in fact only 6 RFID tags that are approved by WLIC/NAIS at this time: 2 manufactured by Allflex, 2 by Digital Angel, one by Y-Tex and 1 by Global Animal Management. All four are WLIC members. =Religious concerns= Finally, fears persist about plans to make NAIS mandatory on the federal level, which would threaten the religious freedom of those who believe that making a “mark” is sinful, such as the Amish. The Amish also object to the use of electronic devices such as microchips. If microchip implants were required, as has been proposed in a 2004 report by the United States Animal Health Association’s Committee on Livestock Identification, it would also violate the rights of those who believe that this practice is morally wrong. Other countries The European Union introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or TRACES, in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries. In the EU, animals must be tagged with details of their origin and stamped with the traceability code of the abattoir when slaughtered. The tools used may vary from one country to another and can include ear tags, passports and bar codes, but must carry the same information. Australia's National Livestock Identification System, or NLIS, is used to identify and track livestock from property of birth to slaughter using RFID devices and a central electronic database of an animal’s residency and animals it has interacted with. The government claims the system improves food safety and access to export markets, and assists with disease management. Farmers must register their property if they hold one or more heads of livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer and camels, though the NLIS will not confirm ownership of livestock. The system originates from a cattle-tracing system introduced in Australia in the 1960s to help fight bovine tuberculosis.http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/aahc/programs/adsp/nlis/nlis_home.cfm The Australian system has over 11,000,000 phantom livestock in the system that do not exist. This system costs farmers money because of the increased handling time and lost margins when tags do not match in the system resulting in lower payments to farmers. New Zealand is planning a similar National Animal Identification and Tracing system.

The three-dimensional simulation is an experimental tool which can be used to study the morphogenesis of fungal hyphal networks. The modelling process starts from the proposition that each hypha in the fungal mycelium generates a certain abstract field that (like known physical fields) decreases with increasing distance. Both scalar and vector fields are included in the models. The field(s) and its (their) gradient(s) are used to inform the algorithm that calculates the likelihood of branching, the angle of branching and the growth direction of each hyphal tip in the simulated mycelium. The growth vector is being informed of its surroundings so, effectively, the virtual hyphal tip is sensing the neighbouring mycelium. This is why we call it the Neighbour-Sensing model. Cross-walls in living hyphae are formed only at right angles to the long axis of the hypha. A daughter hyphal apex can only arise if a branch is initiated. So, for the fungi, hyphal branch formation is the equivalent of cell division in animals, plants and protists. The position of origin of a branch, and its direction and rate of growth are the main formative events in the development of fungal tissues and organs. Consequently, by simulating the mathematics of the control of hyphal growth and branching the Neighbour-Sensing model provides the user with a way of experimenting with features that may regulate hyphal growth patterns during morphogenesis to arrive at suggestions that could be tested with live fungi. The model was proposed by Audrius Meškauskas and David Moore in 2004 and developed using the supercomputing facilities of the University of Manchester. The key idea of this model is that all parts of the fungal mycelium have identical field generation systems, field sensing mechanisms and growth direction altering algorithms. Under properly chosen model parameters it is possible to observe the transformation of the initial unordered mycelium structure into various forms, some of them being very like natural fungal fruit bodies and other complex structures. In one of the simplest examples, it is assumed that the hyphal tips try to keep a 45 degree orientation with relation to the Earth’s gravity vector field, and also generate some kind of scalar field that the growing tips try to avoid. This combination of parameters leads to development of hollow conical structures, similar to the fruit bodies of some primitive fungi. After changing the parameter set, the initially chaotic formation (in the center) starts forming cords In another example, the hypha generates a vector field parallel to the hyphal axis, and the tips tend to turn parallel to that field. After more tips turn in the same direction, their hyphae form a stronger directional field. In this way, it is possible to observe spontaneous orientation of growing hypha in a single direction, which simulates the strands, cords and rhizomorphs produced by many species of fungi in nature. The parameters under which the model operates can be changed during its execution. This allows a greater variety of structures to be formed (including mushroom - like shapes) and may be supposed to simulate cases where the growth strategy depends on an internal biological clock. The Neighbour-Sensing model explains how various fungal structures may arise because of the ‘crowd behaviour’ of the community of hyphal tips that make up the mycelium.

The member states of the ACN agreed to phase in new Andean passports bearing the official name of the regional body in Spanish by January 2005, although previously issued national passports will be valid until their expiry date. The passport is effective in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and formerly, in Venezuela. Because Venezuela left the ACN in 2006, the country no longer issues Andean passports, and it is most likely to start issuing a new MERCOSUR-style passport as the country became a full member of that organization.

It was released in September 2007 through New Line Cinema and directed by The Red Violin director, François Girard. American actor Michael Pitt stars in the lead role of the French silkworm smuggler Hervé Joncour, with English actress Keira Knightley as his wife, Hélène, a teacher and keen gardener. Japanese actors Miki Nakatani and Kōji Yakusho are also featured. Exterior Japanese scenes were filmed in the city of Sakata. Knightley's scenes were filmed in Sermoneta, Italy, a small medieval village near Latina. Hélène's garden was filmed at Villa Lina, near Ronciglione. Plot The film opens with Hervé narrating his observations of an unidentified Asian woman bathing in a hot spring, then stating that his story actually begins earlier, when he returned to his hometown in 19th century France while on leave from the army. He meets Hélène, a teacher, who wants nothing more than a garden and Hervé, who wants nothing more than to marry her. Local businessman Baldabiou, who runs three silk mills that support the town economy, is at risk from a European-wide silkworm disease. He convinces Hervé‘s father, the mayor, to let Hervé leave the army and marry Hélène, and in 1862 Hervé travels to Egypt to purchase silkworm eggs. Since the African silkworms are affected too, Baldabiou next sends Hervé to Japan, even though it is dangerously closed to foreigners. The journey takes months, across thousands of miles of Europe and Asia. Once there, Hervé is blindfolded and taken to a Japanese village where he can buy eggs from a local baron, Hara Jubei. During his stay in the village he becomes obsessed with Jubei's unnamed concubine (the Girl). Hervé returns home with an ample supply of eggs. His compensation from Baldabiou makes him rich, and he purchases a large house and garden space for Hélène. On his second journey to Japan, the Girl gives Hervé a note in Japanese, and he has sex with another girl handed to him by her. Having traded more eggs than on his first trip, Hervé delays his departure by two days in the failed hope of seeing the Girl again. Back home, Hervé seeks out a Japanese brothel owner in Lyon, Madame Blanche, known for giving the small blue flowers that she wears to her clients. He only wants her to translate the note for him, which reads: \\"Come back or I shall die.\\" Madame Blanche advises Hervé to \\"forget about her, she won't die, and you know it.\\" Baldabiou intends to send Hervé to China, since Japan is no longer safe, but Hervé insists on Japan. When he arrives, war has broken out and the village is abandoned. Jubei's servant boy shows Hervé where Jubei and his household have gone. Jubei becomes hostile and tells Hervé to go home, refuses to show him the Girl, and hangs the servant boy. Hervé buys some eggs in Sakata, but his delays result in the eggs hatching, and all the worms dying, before he reaches France. The town’s economy is ruined, though Hervé hires many townspeople to expand Hélène's garden. Months later, Hervé receives a long letter from the Girl. He again takes the letter to Madame Blanche for translation, who agrees, providing Hervé never comes to see her again. The letter is a deeply moving declaration of love, asking him to be happy in his life, as they will never be together again. A few years later, Hélène becomes ill, dying, then dies in 1875, in her mid-30s. After her death, Hervé finds a tribute of small, blue flowers on her grave. He seeks out Madame Blanche once more, believing her to have written the letter, but she reveals that Hélène had written the letter and asked Madame Blanche to translate it. Hélène knew that Hervé was in love with a Japanese woman, and wanted him to be happy. Madame Blanche tells Hervé that, more than anything, his wife wanted to be that woman. Hervé finally realizes that it was Hélène who was his true love after all. Hervé’s narration is revealed to be him recounting his story to Ludovic – the son of a friend, the closest thing to a child that Hervé and Hélène have had through the years. Ludovic, now a young man and Hélène's permanent gardener, has a greater appreciation for the love behind the garden.

His sobriquet, meaning \\"Eight-Minded\\" in Old East Slavic, was granted to him in recognition of his wisdom. Some scholars even assert that Yaroslav was fluent in eight foreign languages.  Biography  Son of Volodymyrko of Halych by his wife, a daughter of King Coloman of Hungary, he assumed the throne in 1153. His foreign policy tended towards the alliance with the kings of Hungary and Poland, and against the Grand Princes of Kiev, who supported Yaroslav's cousin Ivan Berladnik in his attempts to take possession of several towns bordering Volynia. After many years of warfare, Yaroslav managed to ensure Berladnik's expulsion to Byzantium. In 1164-65 Andronikos the cousin of Manuel I Komnenos, the Byzantine emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and fled to the court of Yaroslav. This situation, holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia (Halych) and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. Yaroslav of Galicia was persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Byzantine Empire, at that time the Cumans.D. Obolensky, The Byzantine Commonwealth, 299–302. The latter part of his reign was beset by family troubles. He fell in love with one Halychian woman, named Anastasia (also called Nastasia), took her as a concubine, repudiating his lawful wife Olga, the daughter of Yury Dolgoruky, in 1172. The powerful Halychian boyars, who were reluctant to accept Anastasia as their queen, instigated a popular uprising, which resulted in Anastasia's being burnt at the stake. Yaroslav was constrained to deliver the oath to live with Olga in peace but in next year had her expelled to her native Suzdal with a son, Vladimirko. He bequeathed his throne to a natural son by Anastasia (Oleg, sardonically called Nastasyich by the populace), while the lawful heir Vladimirko had to content himself with Przemyśl for the beginning. Very soon, the illegitimate brother Oleg was killed and Vladimirko rose to the entire principality of Halych.  The Tale of Igor's Campaign  Yaroslav's daughter Eufrosinia and her husband Igor Svyatoslavich are central figures of the ancient Tale of Igor's Campaign. Yaroslav is mentioned in the text as a powerful and respectable potentate: :Eight-minded Yaroslav of Halych! You sit high on your gold-forged throne; you have braced the Hungarian mountains with your iron troops; you have barred the [Hungarian] king's path; you have closed the Danube's gates, hurling weighty missiles over the clouds, spreading your courts to the Danube. Your thunders range over lands; you open Kiev's gates; from the paternal golden throne you shoot at sultans beyond the lands.Trans. Nabokov, Vladimir.

Originally, he was buried in the Assumption Cathedral in ancient Halych (now the village of Krylos, in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine). In 1939 his stone sarcophagus was discovered by Ukrainian archaeologist Jaroslaw Pasternak, after his long search for the cathedral that was destroyed by Mongol-Tatar hordes and never rebuilt later. It appeared that the burial was looted earlier and Yaroslav's bones were found mixed with bones of a young princess of unknown family. The sarcophagus is displayed in the History museum of Ivano-Frankivsk. Trying to secure his archaeological artifacts from ancient Halych and drawings of the cathedral in Krylos before the Soviet occupation of Western Ukraine, Jaroslaw Pasternak hid them in an undisclosed location shortly after he emigrated to Germany, where he died without disclosing the secret place. The purported remains were found for the second time in 1992, hidden in the crypt of St. George Cathedral in Lviv, by archeologist Yuriy Lukomskyy.

They were technically similar to MSX computers, but were not compatible.  History  In 1984, the Norwegian company Norbit Elektronikk Norge A/S run by A. S. Fiko developed a complete Input/Output (I/O) control system with 4× 16-bits by using the blue Memotech 8-bit Dual in-line package DIL socket for I/O controls. The socket was located on the computer motherboard. Norbit Elektronikk used their Super ToolBox system and was able to use 16-bits by adding two data blocks of 8 bits at the same time. Digital I/O ports, Analog-to-digital converter and Digital-to- analog converter with all kind of sensor systems for robotics and controls were developed. The control system was designed for the same aluminium casing as the main MTX512 unit. In 1984/85 Memotech was working on a huge project to deliver the CP/M-based MTX512 together with the FDX and the control unit from Norbit Elektronikk to 64,000 schools in the USSR Popular Computing Weekly To Russia with love with the potentials to sell about 200,000 units. The USSR was at that time under embargo by the United States, and companies were not allowed to deliver the new IBM Personal Computer with MS-DOS to USSR. CP/M computers were not included in the Soviet embargo blockage and Memotech's MTX512 was therefore a good option. Memotech went into receivership in 1985. A contributing factor, beyond the poor commercial success of the MTX, was the substantial investment Memotech made in preparing the MTX512 for the Soviet deal. This required a red brushed aluminium case instead of the black (made at a factory in the Netherlands), Russian BASIC, Russian character encoding, Russian keyboard and Russian documentation. Memotech worked with a professor at University of Oxford for the internationalisation. The Soviet government was also evaluating computer systems from other home computer manufacturers. Memotech was relying on the British government for funding the project, but ultimately, they only received about £1m and did not receive the full funding required. As a result, Memotech required cash payments from the USSR prior to supplying the 64,000 computers. The Soviets decided against this cash deal and instead agreed to acquire MSX computers from Yamaha (another later big deal was with Daewoo) with bartering mainly in steel and oil. Only a few thousand MSX computers were supplied to USSR schools and other educational institutions USSR UK firms let-down as USSR goes MSXMEMOTECH to USSR. The Sovjet deal before the deal went dead. The main reason was the USSR thought that MSX was the new Microsoft Operating system. Since Memotech lost the deal to the USSR,Popular Computing Weekly To Russia with love and they had invested all their money in the project, money that was borrowed from the banks, plus the £1m funding from the UK government, Memotech went bankrupt. Some of the Memotech inventions still lived on, as several employees took some of Memotech's new video editing systems for televisions back to the USA. As a result of Memotech's bankruptcy, the UK government stopped funding to all computer manufacturers in the UK at that time, including Sinclair, Acorn and Apricot.

Although the Z80A could only address a maximum of 64KB at a time, the MTX and RS128's extra memory, up to a maximum of 768KB, was accessible through the technique of page switching. All models had 24KB of ROM accessible in the first 16KB of address space. The extra 8KB of ROM was available through page switching. The ROM could be switched out entirely, allowing the full 16-bit address space to be used for RAM. The computers featured an all-aluminium case and full-size keyboard with real keys (unlike the chiclet keyboard used on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum). In addition to the standard (for the time) BASIC language interpreter, it included some other software: * A built-in assembler * A built-in disassembler/debugger called Panel * A forerunner of HyperCard called Noddy * Support for rudimentary windowing in BASIC The computers also featured support for plug-in ROM cartridges (a little like the BBC Micro). The most popular of these was the ISO Pascal language from HiSoft which was much faster than interpreted BASIC.

Its purpose is to protect consumers from unfair billing practices and to provide a mechanism for addressing billing errors in \\"open end\\" credit accounts, such as credit card or charge card accounts. Examples of billing errors The following are examples of billing errors under the FCBA: * Charges not actually made by the consumer * Charges in the wrong amount. * Charges for goods or services not received by the consumer * Charges for goods not delivered as agreed * Charges for goods that were damaged on delivery * Failures to properly reflect payments or credits to an account * Calculation errors * Charges that the consumer wants clarified or requests proof of * Statements mailed to the wrong address * Significantly not as described product/goods Correction of billing errors The FCBA allows consumers to dispute billing errors by sending a written notice of the dispute to the creditor. To trigger duties under the Act, a person must send a written dispute via mail to the \\"billing inquiries\\" address on their credit card statement, not the address for sending payments. This dispute must be received by the creditor within sixty days of the statement date on the account statement that first contained the billing error. Notice given by telephone is not sufficient to trigger the protections of the FCBA; a consumer can only protect their rights under the Act by sending a written notice, or online if the creditor indicates to consumers that it will accept notices electronically. Banks may accept disputes by phone while warning their customers that phone complaints do not preserve the customer's rights under the Act. This often leads to a chargeback to the vendor. After receiving notice of a dispute, the credit issuer must acknowledge the dispute within thirty days, investigate the claim and, within ninety days, either make appropriate corrections to the account or send a letter to the consumer explaining why the creditor believes there was no error. If the creditor responds that they believe there was no error, the consumer can request copies of documentation supporting the validity of the disputed items. Other regulations of the FCBA In addition to creating a mechanism for dealing with billing errors, the FCBA contains additional regulations, including the following: * Billing statements must be sent at least fourteen days before the payment is due for open end credit accounts that have a grace period prior to adding finance charges. * If banks report payments as delinquent to credit bureaus they must also report a charge is disputed. * Credit card companies may not prohibit merchants from offering discounts to people who pay with cash or check. * Banks may generally not use money in checking or savings accounts to pay a delinquent credit account with the same bank. * The FCBA's § 170 gives a consumer the right to sue or assert defenses against the credit company (instead of the actual merchant) in a dispute about the quality of goods or services received, to the dollar extent of the amount of the charge(s) involved.(The dollar amount of the charge must exceed $50, and the purchase must have been made in the consumer's home state or within 100 miles of their address (unless the creditor is affiliated with the merchant, in which case these restrictions do not apply). The consumer must also make a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute prior to invoking this right.)  Enforcement of the FCBA  The Federal Trade Commission is the \\"overall enforcing agency\\" for purposes of administrative enforcement, though compliance by banks is enforced under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A consumer may also file a private lawsuit in any state or federal court with jurisdiction over the parties to recover actual damages, statutory damages of double the erroneous finance charge(s), and his or her costs and attorney fees (if the claim is successful). If the alleged unlawful conduct is widespread, the consumer can also seek to file a class action suit and seek damages up to the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor.

The wavevectors at which Van Hove singularities occur are often referred to as critical points of the Brillouin zone. For three-dimensional crystals, they take the form of kinks (where the density of states is not differentiable). The most common application of the Van Hove singularity concept comes in the analysis of optical absorption spectra. The occurrence of such singularities was first analyzed by the Belgian physicist Léon Van Hove in 1953 for the case of phonon densities of states.  Theory  Consider a one-dimensional lattice of N particle sites, with each particle site separated by distance a, for a total length of L = Na. Instead of assuming that the waves in this one-dimensional box are standing waves, it is more convenient to adopt periodic boundary conditions:See equation 2.9 in http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/BandMT_02.pdf From \\\\phi(x+L)=\\\\phi(x) we have kL=2n\\\\pi :k=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}=n\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{L} where \\\\lambda is wavelength, and n is an integer. (Positive integers will denote forward waves, negative integers will denote reverse waves.) The shortest wavelength needed to describe a wavemotion in the lattice is equal to 2a which then corresponds to the largest needed wave number k_{max}=\\\\pi/a and which also corresponds to the maximum possible n: n_{max}=L/2a. We may define the density of states g(k)dk as the number of standing waves with wave vector k to k+dk:*M. A. Parker(1997-2004)\\"Introduction to Density of States\\" Marcel-Dekker Publishing p.7. :g(k)dk = dn =\\\\frac{L}{2\\\\pi}\\\\,dk Extending the analysis to wavevectors in three dimensions the density of states in a box will be :g(\\\\vec{k})d^3k = d^3n =\\\\frac{L^3}{(2\\\\pi)^3}\\\\,d^3k where d^3k is a volume element in k-space, and which, for electrons, will need to be multiplied by a factor of 2 to account for the two possible spin orientations. By the chain rule, the DOS in energy space can be expressed as :dE = \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial k_x}dk_x + \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial k_y}dk_y + \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial k_z}dk_z = \\\\vec{ abla}E \\\\cdot d\\\\vec{k} where \\\\vec{ abla} is the gradient in k-space. The set of points in k-space which correspond to a particular energy E form a surface in k-space, and the gradient of E will be a vector perpendicular to this surface at every point.* The density of states as a function of this energy E satisfies: :g(E)dE = \\\\iint_{\\\\partial E}g(\\\\vec{k})\\\\,d^3k = \\\\frac{L^3}{(2\\\\pi)^3}\\\\iint_{\\\\partial E}dk_x\\\\,dk_y\\\\,dk_z where the integral is over the surface \\\\partial E of constant E. We can choose a new coordinate system k'_x,k'_y,k'_z\\\\, such that k'_z\\\\, is perpendicular to the surface and therefore parallel to the gradient of E. If the coordinate system is just a rotation of the original coordinate system, then the volume element in k-prime space will be :dk'_x\\\\,dk'_y\\\\,dk'_z = dk_x\\\\,dk_y\\\\,dk_z We can then write dE as: :dE=\\\\vec{ abla}E\\\\,dk'_z and, substituting into the expression for g(E) we have: :g(E)=\\\\frac{L^3}{(2\\\\pi)^3}\\\\iint\\\\frac{dk'_x\\\\,dk'_y}{\\\\vec{ abla}E} where the dk'_x\\\\,dk'_y term is an area element on the constant-E surface. The clear implication of the equation for g(E) is that at the k-points where the dispersion relation E(\\\\vec{k}) has an extremum, the integrand in the DOS expression diverges. The Van Hove singularities are the features that occur in the DOS function at these k-points. A detailed analysis* This book contains an extensive discussion of the types of Van Hove singularities in different dimensions and illustrates the concepts with detailed theoretical-versus- experimental comparisons for Ge and graphite. shows that there are four types of Van Hove singularities in three-dimensional space, depending on whether the band structure goes through a local maximum, a local minimum or a saddle point. In three dimensions, the DOS itself is not divergent although its derivative is. The function g(E) tends to have square-root singularities (see the Figure) since for a spherical free electron gas Fermi surface :E = \\\\hbar^2 k^2/2m so that \\\\vec{ abla}E = \\\\hbar^2 k/m = \\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{2E}{m}}. In two dimensions the DOS is logarithmically divergent at a saddle point and in one dimension the DOS itself is infinite where \\\\vec{ abla}E is zero. A sketch of the DOS g(E) versus energy E for a simulated three-dimensional solid. The Van Hove singularities occur where dg(E)/dE diverges.  Experimental observation  The optical absorption spectrum of a solid is most straightforwardly calculated from the electronic band structure using Fermi's Golden Rule where the relevant matrix element to be evaluated is the dipole operator \\\\vec{A} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{p} where \\\\vec{A} is the vector potential and \\\\vec{p} is the momentum operator. The density of states which appears in the Fermi's Golden Rule expression is then the joint density of states, which is the number of electronic states in the conduction and valence bands that are separated by a given photon energy. The optical absorption is then essentially the product of the dipole operator matrix element (also known as the oscillator strength) and the JDOS. The divergences in the two- and one- dimensional DOS might be expected to be a mathematical formality, but in fact they are readily observable. Highly anisotropic solids like graphite (quasi-2D) and Bechgaard salts (quasi-1D) show anomalies in spectroscopic measurements that are attributable to the Van Hove singularities. Van Hove singularities play a significant role in understanding optical intensities in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) which are also quasi-1D systems. The Dirac point in graphene is a Van-Hove singularity that can be seen directly as a peak in electrical resistance, when the graphene is charge-neutral. Twisted graphene layers also show pronounced Van-Hove singularities in the DOS due to the interlayer coupling.

Coin It is a silver coin with on the obverse the legend DEI GRATIA REX BOEMIE (\\"By the grace of God the King of Bohemia\\") and on the reverse GROSSI PRAGENSES (\\"Prague groschen\\"). The weight of the coin varies between 3.5 and 3.7 g with a fineness of 933/1000 of silver. The groschen was subdivided into twelve parvus (\\"small\\") coins with a Bohemian heraldic lion sign on the obverse. History Silver content of the Prague groschen in grams during the period of their mintage (1300–1526) Minting of this coin started around 1300 after silver mines had been discovered in Kutná Hora during the reign of the Bohemian king Wenceslaus II. King Wenceslaus II invited the Italian lawyer Gozzius of Orvieto to create a mining code Ius regale montanorum which was also partly a reform of the coinage. This, and the high amount of silver found in Kutná hora resulted in the implementation of Prague groschen. Because of the high amount of silver used in the coin it became one of the most popular of the early Groschen-type coins in medieval Europe. In documents of the era, like e.g. the Peace of Thorn (1411), large amounts of money often were given in more convenient unit, called in Latin sexagena (= threescore) of Prague groschen, which equals to Czech term kopa = 5 dozen = ½ small gross = 60. After the opening of new silver mines in Jáchymov (Joachimsthal) the Thaler, in the Bohemia known as tolar, came in use. In 1547, minting of Prague groschen was discontinued by king Ferdinand I. Etymology The inspiration came from France where groschen were used since 1266, and replaced old coins called denar. The name came from the Latin denarius grossus ().

Gregory was the original owner of the house and his descendants lived there until 1914, when his daughter Jennie Gregory died. Afterwards it became the residence of the family of Horace Greely Prettyman, who owned the Ann Arbor Press and White Swan Laundry. They added the porte cochere at this time. The Prettyman family lived here until around 1945, after which Abbie Schaefer took it over and ran it as a rooming house called Abby House. In 1960 it was purchased by the Inter-Cooperative Council and opened as women's housing cooperative in the Fall of 1961. In 1991, it became the only all-female co-op in the ICC system.

Early life Ashley was born in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1790; while a child he moved with his parents to Hudson, New York. He was a graduate, with honors, of Williams College; following this, he attended the Litchfield Law School. Ashley moved west upon completion of his education, going first to Illinois, and thence to Missouri. In 1820 he arrived in Little Rock, Arkansas, soon becoming one of the best and most prominent lawyers in the Arkansas Territory; for a time, his partner in practice was Robert Crittenden. Together, Ashley and Crittenden founded Rose Law Firm. Legal and political career For some twenty years Ashley's practice was the largest in the state, and he became a wealthy man. This led him to try his hand at politics; in 1844 he canvassed the state campaigning for James K. Polk for president; the Democrats were victorious, and Ashley was elected by the state legislature to fill a vacancy in the Senate. Soon after entering, he was made the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; in 1846, he was reelected to the Senate. Two years later, he became suddenly ill in the Senate Chamber and died not long after. Personal life One of Ashley's descendants is Sterling R.

The 18th Disney animated feature film, it is based on T. H. White's novel of the same name, published in 1938 as a single novel, then republished in 1958 as the first book of the Arthurian tetralogy The Once and Future King. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, the film features the voices of Rickie Sorensen, Karl Swenson, Junius Matthews, Sebastian Cabot, Norman Alden, and Martha Wentworth. Walt Disney first acquired the film rights to the novel in 1939, and various attempts at developing the film lasted two decades before actual production on the film officially began. The Sword in the Stone was the last animated film from Walt Disney Productions to be released during Walt Disney's lifetime before his death on December 15, 1966. Bill Peet wrote the story for the film, while the songs were written and composed by the Sherman Brothers. This marked the first contribution of the Sherman Brothers to the music in an animated Disney film, and they would later write the music for other Disney films, such as Mary Poppins (1964), The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970), and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977). George Bruns composed the film's score, the third film he had scored for Disney, following Sleeping Beauty (1959) and One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Bruns later composed the score for the next three Disney animated films: The Jungle Book, The Aristocats, and Robin Hood (1973). The Sword in the Stone was released to theaters on December 25, 1963, to mixed reviews, though it was a box-office success. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1983 on a double bill with Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. A live-action remake of the film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo entered development in 2015, and is to be released on Disney+.  Plot  After the King of England, Uther Pendragon, dies, leaving no heir to the throne, a sword appears inside an anvil in London, with an inscription proclaiming that whoever removes it is the rightful King of England. None succeed in removing the sword, which becomes forgotten, leaving England in the Dark Ages. Years later, a 12-year-old orphan named Arthur, commonly called Wart, accidentally scares off a deer his older foster brother Kay was hunting, causing Kay to launch his arrow into the forest. In attempting to retrieve the arrow, Arthur meets Merlin, an elderly wizard who lives with his talking pet owl Archimedes. Merlin declares himself Arthur's tutor and returns with him to his home, a castle run by Sir Ector, Arthur's foster father. Ector's friend, Pellinore, arrives to announce that the annual jousting tournament will be held in London, and the winner will be crowned king. Ector decides to put Kay through serious training for the tournament and appoints Arthur as Kay's squire. To educate Arthur, Merlin transforms the boy and himself into fish. They swim in the castle moat to learn about physics. After the lesson, Arthur is sent to the kitchen as punishment for attempting to relate his lesson to a disbelieving Ector. Merlin enchants the dishes to wash themselves, then takes Arthur for another lesson, turning them into squirrels to learn about gravity. After they return to human form, Ector accuses Merlin of using black magic on the dishes, which Ector discovered and tries to fight off, while Merlin and Arthur are away. Arthur defiantly defends Merlin, but Ector refuses to listen and punishes Arthur by giving Kay another squire, Hobbs and also revoked Arthur's chance of going to London. Resolving to make amends, Merlin plans on educating Arthur full-time. However, Merlin's knowledge of future history confuses Arthur, prompting Merlin to appoint Archimedes as Arthur's teacher to teach Arthur. Merlin transforms Arthur into a sparrow and Archimedes teaches him how to fly. Soon after, Arthur encounters Madam Mim, an eccentric, evil witch who is Merlin's nemesis. Merlin arrives to rescue Arthur, and Mim challenges Merlin to a wizards' duel. Despite Mim's cheating, Merlin outsmarts her by transforming into a germ that infects Mim, thus illustrating the importance of knowledge over strength. On Christmas Eve, Kay is knighted, but Hobbs comes down with the mumps; therefore, Ector reinstates Arthur as Kay's squire. This causes Merlin to think that Arthur cares more about war games than having an education, and when Arthur defends his choices, Merlin unwittingly transports himself in time to 20th-century Bermuda in his anger. On the day of the tournament, Arthur realizes that he has left Kay's sword at an inn, which is now closed for the tournament. Archimedes sees the legendary \\"Sword in the Stone\\" in a nearby churchyard, which Arthur removes almost effortlessly, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy. When Arthur returns with the sword, Ector recognizes it and the tournament is halted. Ector places the sword back in its anvil, demanding Arthur prove that he pulled it. He pulls it once again, revealing that he is England's rightful king. Ector begs forgiveness from Arthur as the tournament knights cheer for him. Later, the newly crowned King Arthur sits in the throne room with Archimedes, feeling unprepared for the responsibility of ruling, but Merlin returns from his vacation and resolves to help Arthur become the great king that he has foreseen him to be.  Cast  * Rickie Sorensen, Richard Reitherman, and Robert Reitherman as Arthur, also known as Wart, Disney's adaptation of legendary British leader King Arthur: Arthur was voiced by three actors, leading to noticeable changes in voice between scenes — and sometimes, within the same scene. Also, the three voices have American accents, sharply contrasting with the English setting and the accents spoken by most of the other characters in the film. Mari Ness of the online magazine Tor.com suggests, \\"Given that the film is about growing up, this problem might have been overcome\\" with the three voices being interpreted as Arthur's character development both mentally and physically; however, she also notes that \\"the director inexplicably chose to leave all three voices in for some scenes, drawing attention to the problem that they were not the same actor.\\" She notes even further that \\"Two [of the voice actors] were brothers, and sound somewhat similar; the third was not, and sounds distinctly different.\\" Finally, she notes the issue of the American accents of the voices contrasting with the English setting and the accents spoken by most of the other characters in the film, noting, \\"The only positive: the vocal issues with Wart do help distract attention from the fact that the Brits aren’t particularly good here, either.\\" * Karl Swenson as Merlin, an old and eccentric wizard who aids and educates Arthur * Junius Matthews as Archimedes, Merlin's crotchety yet highly educated pet owl, who has the ability to speak * Sebastian Cabot as Sir Ector, Arthur's foster father: Though he loves Arthur, he often treats him harshly. Cabot also provides the narration at the beginning and end of the film. * Norman Alden as Sir Kay, Arthur's irritable older foster brother and Ector's son * Martha Wentworth as Madam Mim, a black- magic proficient witch and Merlin's nemesis: Mim's magic uses trickery, as opposed to Merlin's scientific skill. Wentworth also voiced the Granny Squirrel, a dim-witted, elderly female squirrel that develops an attraction to Merlin. * Alan Napier as Pellinore, a friend of Lord Ector's who announces the jousting tournament * Thurl Ravenscroft as Sir Bart, one of the knights seen at the jousting tournament * James MacDonald as The Wolf, an unnamed, starving wolf that has several encounters with Arthur, and attempts to eat him, but is constantly met with misfortune * Ginny Tyler as the Little Girl Squirrel, a young female squirrel that immediately develops an attraction to Arthur upon encountering him * Barbara Jo Allen as Scullery Maid, Ector's maid, who believes Merlin to be an evil sorcerer * Tudor Owen as the background voice of one of the knights in the crowd during the tournament  Production  In February 1939, Walt Disney announced had purchased the film rights to T. H. White's The Sword in the Stone. However, following the outbreak of World War II, the studio was restricted by the United States government to produce cartoons for the armed services. In June 1944, following the successful re- release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Disney had assigned writers to work on The Sword in the Stone along with Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. The project continued to be announced to be in active development throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. In June 1960, Disney told the Los Angeles Times that following the release of One Hundred and One Dalmatians, two animated projects were in development, which were Chanticleer and The Sword in the Stone. Around that same time, Disney's elder brother Roy O. Disney attempted to persuade him to discontinue their feature animation division, as enough films remained to make successful re-releases. The younger Disney refused, but because of his plans to build another theme park in the United States, he approved only one animated film to be released every four years. Concurrently, Chanticleer was being developed by Ken Anderson and Marc Davis, who aimed to produce a feature animated film in a more contemporary setting. Both of them had visited the Disney archives, and decided to adapt the satirical tale into production upon glancing at earlier conceptions dating back to the 1940s. Anderson, Davis, Milt Kahl, and director Wolfgang Reitherman spent months preparing elaborate storyboards for Chanticleer, and following a silent response to a pitch presentation, a voice from the back of the room said, \\"You can't make a personality out of a chicken!\\" When the time came to approve one of the two projects, Walt remarked that the problem with making a rooster a protagonist was, \\"[you] don't feel like picking up a rooster up and petting it.\\" Meanwhile, work on The Sword in the Stone were solely done by veteran story artist Bill Peet. After Disney had seen the 1960 Broadway production of Camelot, he approved the project to enter production. Ollie Johnston stated, \\"[Kahl] got furious with Bill for not pushing Chanticleer after all the work he had put in on it. He said, 'I can draw a damn fine rooster, you know.' Bill said, 'So can I.'\\" Peet recalled \\"how humiliated they were to accept defeat and give in to The Sword in the Stone...He allowed to have their own way, and they let him down. They never understood that I wasn't trying to compete with them, just trying to do what I wanted to work. I was the midst of all this competition, and with Walt to please, too.\\" Writing in his autobiography, Peet decided to write a screenplay before producing storyboards, though he found the narrative \\"complicated, with the Arthurian legend woven into a mixture of other legends and myths\\" and finding a direct storyline required \\"sifting and sorting\\". After Walt received the first screenplay draft, he told Peet that it should have more substance. On his second draft, Peet lengthened it by enlarging on the more dramatic aspects of the story, which Walt approved of through a call from Palm Springs, Florida. A new animation technique, \\"touch-up\\", was created during production. The animation process had previously involved the use of clean-ups where assistant animators transferred the directing animators' sketches by hand onto a new sheet of paper, which were later copied to an animation cel. Clean-ups was replaced by touch-ups, where the assistants drew directly on the animators' sketches before the drawing was copied onto a cel. = Casting = For the voice of Merlin, director Wolfgang Reitherman estimated that 70 actors read for the part, but \\"none evidenced that note of eccentricity that we were seeking. We wanted Merlin to be eccentric but not hokey.\\" At the same time, Karl Swenson was initially cast for Archimedes, but the filmmakers decided to cast him, instead, as Merlin. Rickie Sorensen, who had voiced young Arthur, entered puberty during production, which forced the older Reitherman to cast his sons, Richard and Robert, to replace him.  Release  The Sword in the Stone was re-released on December 22, 1972. The film was again re-released to theaters on March 25, 1983, as a double feature with Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. = Home media = The Sword in the Stone was released on North American VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc in 1986 as an installment of the Walt Disney Classics collection. The film was re-released on VHS in 1989, as well as another VHS and Laserdisc release on July 12, 1991. It was first released on VHS in the United Kingdom in 1988 followed by a re-issue the following year. It was re-released on VHS and Laserdisc on October 28, 1994, as a part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection. It was released on DVD on March 20, 2001, as an installment in the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line-up. It includes two classic short films, A Knight for a Day and Brave Little Tailor, as well as the film facts. The DVD of the film was re-released as a 45th- anniversary special edition on June 17, 2008. For its 50th anniversary, it was released on Blu-ray on August 6, 2013.  Reception  = Box office = The Sword in the Stone earned estimated theatrical rentals of $4.75 million upon its initial release and a 1972 re-release increased its North American rentals to $6.5 million. The film was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1983, and grossed $12 million. The film has had a lifetime domestic gross of $22.2 million in North America. = Critical reception = The Sword in the Stone received mixed reviews from critics, who thought it had too much humor and a \\"thin narrative\\". Variety wrote that the film \\"demonstrates anew the magic of the Disney animators and imagination in character creation. But one might wish for a script which stayed more with the basic story line rather than taking so many twists and turns which have little bearing on the tale about King Arthur as a lad.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the film, claiming it is \\"an eye-filling package of rollicking fun and thoughtful common sense. The humor sparkles with real, knowing sophistication — meaning for all ages — and some of the characters on the fifth-century landscape of Old England are Disney pips.\\" Philip K. Scheuer, reviewing for the Los Angeles Times, described the film as \\"more intimate than usual with a somewhat smaller cast of characters—animal as well as human. Otherwise, the youngsters should find it par the usual Disney cartoon course. It may not be exactly what T. H. White had in mind when he wrote this third of his sophisticated trilogy about King Arthur, but it's a good [bit] livelier than the stage Camelot derived from another third.\\" On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 28 reviews with an average score of 5.95/10. Its consensus states, \\"A decent take on the legend of King Arthur, The Sword in the Stone suffers from relatively indifferent animation, but its characters are still memorable and appealing.\\" Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars, writing, \\"Delightful classic brings Arthur legend to life\\". In his book The Best of Disney, Neil Sinyard states that, despite not being well known, the film has excellent animation, a complex structure, and is actually more philosophical than other Disney features. Sinyard suggests that Walt Disney may have seen something of himself in Merlin, and that Mim, who \\"hates wholesome sunshine\\", may have represented critics. = Accolades = The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Score—Adaptation or Treatment in 1963, but lost against Irma La Douce. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated The Sword in the Stone for its Top 10 Animated Films list, but among the 50 nominated, it did not reach the top 10.  Soundtrack  ;Deleted songs * \\"The Magic Key\\" * \\"The Sand of Time\\" * \\"Blue Oak Tree\\"  Legacy  Several characters from the film made frequent appearances in the Disney's House of Mouse television series. Merlin was voiced by Hamilton Camp. One notable appearance in the series was in the episode: \\"Rent Day\\", in which he tells Mickey Mouse that he will give him the 50 ups only if he gives Arthur a sword. Wart also made a few appearances in the series, usually seen in crowd shots with Merlin. He also appears with Merlin in the audience in the episode: \\"Mickey vs. Shelby\\" after a cartoon ends. Sir Kay was also seen in the episode: \\"Ask Von Drake\\", when he tries to pull the sword from the stone with Arthur, Merlin, and Madam Mim. Madam Mim appears as a villain in the spin-off film Mickey's House of Villains. In the past, Merlin frequented the Disney Parks, the only character from the film appearing occasionally for meet-and-greets at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort. He appeared in the opening unit of Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams at Disneyland Park. He also hosts the Sword in the Stone ceremony in the King Arthur Carrousel attraction in Fantasyland at Disneyland. In 2014 and 2015, UK health directive Change4Life incorporated \\"Higitus Figitus\\" as the soundtrack to adverts promoting their Disney-sponsored \\"10 minute shake up\\" summer program. = Comics = Madam Mim Madam Mim was adopted into the Duck franchise where she sometimes teams with Magica De Spell and/or the Beagle Boys. She also appeared in the Mickey Mouse franchise where she teamed with Black Pete on occasion and with the Phantom Blot at one point. She was in love with Captain Hook in several stories; in others, with Phantom Blot. In many European Disney comics, she lost her truly evil streak, and appears morbid yet relatively polite. Mim has appeared in numerous comics produced in the United States by Studio Program in the 1960s and 1970s,First is in S 65051, according to the Inducks often as a sidekick of Magica. Most of the stories were published in Europe and South America. Among the artists are Jim Fletcher, Tony Strobl, Wolfgang Schäfer, and Katja Schäfer. Several new characters were introduced in these stories, including Samson Hex, an apprentice of Mim and Magica. = Video games = Madam Mim made a surprise appearance in the video game World of Illusion as the fourth boss of that game. Merlin is a supporting character in the Kingdom Hearts series, now voiced by Jeff Bennett in Kingdom Hearts II. In Kingdom Hearts, Merlin lives in an abandoned shack in Traverse Town with Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, sent by King Mickey to aid Sora, Donald, and Goofy in the art of magic. He owns an old book which features the world of The Hundred Acre Wood, home of Winnie the Pooh. The book's pages, however, have been torn out and scattered across the universe, and Merlin asks Sora to retrieve them for him. He reprises the same role in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, as a figment of Sora's memories. In Kingdom Hearts II, Merlin moved to Hollow Bastion to aid Leon's group as part of the town Restoration Committee, though he is at odds with Cid who prefers his own computer expertise rather than Merlin's magic. Merlin again instructs Sora, Donald and Goofy in the art of magic, and again requests that they retrieve the stolen parts of the Pooh storybook. At one point in the game, he is summoned to Disney Castle by Queen Minnie to counter the threat of Maleficent, and he constructs a door leading to Disney Castle's past (Timeless River) for the trio to explore and stop Maleficent and Pete's plans. In the prequel, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Merlin encounters Terra, Aqua and Ventus, and grants them each access to the Hundred Acre Wood. The prequel also reveals that it was Terra who gave him the book in the first place after finding it in Radiant Garden. According to series creator Tetsuya Nomura, a world based on the film was initially to appear in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, but the idea was scrapped. Merlin returns in Kingdom Hearts III, where he asks Sora to restore Pooh's storybook once more (though it does not involve finding any missing pages), but his involvement in the story is minimal beyond that as he spends his time at Remy's bistro in Twilight Town having tea. = Live- action film adaptation = A live-action feature film adaptation entered development in July 2015, with Bryan Cogman writing the script and Brigham Taylor serving as producer. By January 2018, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was announced as director.

Addressed \\"To All Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World\\", it is general in scope. Background Felicité Robert de Lamennais, Charles Forbes René de Montalembert and Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire started a newspaper, L'Avenir (\\"The Future\\"). While the paper was a strong proponent of Ultramontanism, supporting the authority of the papacy in opposition to nationalist and secularist ideas, it also advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, and universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. They saw no conflict between Catholicism and liberal reform. The conservative French hierarchy regarded such views as dangerous nonsense. In November 1831, Lammennais and Montalembert traveled to Rome, seeking confirmation from Pope Gregory that views expressed in their newspaper were orthodox. Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter.Bernard, Cook. \\"Lamennais, Hugues-Felicité Robert de (1782-1854)\\", Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions, (James Chastain, ed.), Ohio University, 2005 After much opposition, they gained an audience on March 15, 1832, only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. Klemens von Metternich, whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation.Chadwick, Owen. \\"Gregory XVI\\", A History of the Popes, 1830-1914, Oxford University Press, 2003 The Pope's advisors were convinced that if he said nothing, it would be viewed that he did not disapprove of Lamennais's opinions. Mirari vos was issued the following August, criticizing Lamennais's views without mentioning him by name. Content He voiced support for Christian freedom, upheld the ecclesiastical supremacy of the papacy and raised concerns over alliances that were too close between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated a married clergy: \\"We ask that you strive with all your might to justify and to defend the law of clerical celibacy as prescribed by the sacred canons, against which the arrows of the lascivious are directed from every side.\\"Pope Gregory XVI, Mirari vos, §11, Rome, August 15, 1832 He also denounced those who advocated divorce and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states. He attacked religious indifferentism, which was defined as the opinion that one religion is as good as another, which he saw as the basis for the argument for liberty of conscience. He saw it as the state's duty to restrain the promotion of false truth, which leads to immorality and so denounced freedom to publish or distribute any writings indiscriminately. Owen Chadwick explains Gregory's perspective: \\"To provide legally that writers or speakers shall be free to promote what is not true or to utter words that declare that racial prejudice, or paederasty, or pornography, or adultery, or murder not to be sins, cannot be what God demands of any State. He stated, > \\"Some are so carried away that they contentiously assert that the flock of > errors arising from them is sufficiently compensated by the publication of > some book which defends religion and truth. Every law condemns deliberately > doing evil simply because there is some hope that good may result. Is there > any sane man who would say poison ought to be distributed, sold publicly, > stored, and even drunk because some antidote is available and those who use > it may be snatched from death again and again? The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor his detractors.

Life and career Schultz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Katherine Frances Leslie (1917-1995), a factory worker, and German American Leo Albert Schultz (1913-2001), an insurance salesman. His parents married in Iowa, shortly before his birth where both were listed as black on their marriage license. Mr. Schultz's occupation was listed as a musician at the time of his marriage. Senior class high school photo of director Michael Schultz (1957)Michael Schultz, who was known as \\"Mike\\" growing up, attended Riverside High School in Milwaukee, where he was a very active student. He played baseball, football and participated in student theater productions. After his undergraduate work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Marquette University, he attended Princeton University, where in 1966 he directed his first play, a production of Waiting for Godot. He joined the Negro Ensemble Company in 1968, which brought him to Broadway in 1969. His breakthrough was directing Lorraine Hansberry's To Be Young, Gifted and Black, which he restaged for television in 1972. Schultz' earliest film projects combined low comedy with profound social comment (Honeybaby, Honeybaby and Cooley High), reaching a peak with the ensemble comedy Car Wash (1976) and Which Way Is Up? (1977), starring Richard Pryor. In 1978, Schultz took the reins of the musical Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with the largest budget ever entrusted to an African-American film director to that date. However, upon its release, the project was a commercial and critical failure. Schultz would go on to make prominent films such as the ensemble comedy Scavenger Hunt (1979), Denzel Washington's film debut Carbon Copy (1981), and the screwball comedy Disorderlies (1987). More recently, Schultz has worked in television, piloting episodes of such style-conscious series as The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and Picket Fences, as well as an abundance of made-for-TV movies. In 1991, Schultz was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. Personal life Schultz married Gloria Jones in Brooklyn, New York in 1965. As an actress his wife is known professionally as Lauren Jones. In non-acting capacities, she is known as Gloria Schultz. The couple have two children.

Film and television  Filming is now managed all over the system but most commonly takes place at stations like Aldwych (a disused tube station), formerly on the Piccadilly line, or the non-operational Jubilee line complex in Charing Cross. The Waterloo & City line has occasionally been used for filming as it is closed on Sundays. The London Underground Film Office handles over 200 requests a month. * The 1928 film Underground, directed by Anthony Asquith, is a drama about a love quadrangle which begins on a tube train and continues in Waterloo station. It was the first feature film to include sequences shot on the London Underground.https://www.bfi.org.uk/news- opinion/bfi-news/tube-150-10-great-films-underground * The 1929 film Blackmail features a cameo by director Alfred Hitchcock as a passenger on a tube train. * The 1935 film Bulldog Jack, one of the film entries in the Bulldog Drummond series, is a good-natured crime-solving adventure in which a fictional closed Tube station (Bloomsbury) is featured as an important part of the staging of the film, being part of an intricate hideaway for the bad guys, who are pulling a heist from the British Museum. The film is full of secret passages and likable characters. Typical of the genre and the era, the film starts slow, but picks up speed and flies to the end. The Underground becomes a key element in the film when the trail \\"Bulldog\\" and his assistant are on leads them to the boarded-up street entrance of a closed \\"Bloomsbury\\" station; the dapper detectives in tophats and tails ride the Tube circuit back around to the nearest station to the closed one, and then sneak onto the tracks headed to the closed platform. Part way there, a train appears down the tunnels and the men hastily climb onto the tube walls and lay flat, only to see the train disappear one car after another, switching to another Tube line. In a short but memorable scene, \\"Bulldog\\" turns a table upside-down and rides the long spiral staircase all the way to the bottom, passing two crooks on the way, and sliding across the platform and tumbling onto the tracks. The film's smashing climax features a runaway train in the Tube, driven by madman Ralph Richardson, and throughout the scene the point of view is often from the front of the train, similar to a camera mounted in the front car of a roller coaster. In all, Bulldog Jack shows the basic appearance of the Underground in the 1930s and WWII, including the seemingly endless spiral staircases and other features that most Londoners would have been familiar with. * The 1953 film The Yellow Balloon directed by J. Lee Thompson. One of two young boys accidentally falls to his death when playing in a bombed-out London neighbourhood. The climax takes place deep within the Underground at the fictional Western Road station. * The 1967 film Quatermass and the Pit (U.S. title: Five Million Years to Earth) revolves around alien bodies and spacecraft being discovered in the fictional Hobbs End station.https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/nov/23/the-20-best- british-science-fiction-films-in-pictures * The 1968 Doctor Who serial The Web of Fear is set in the tunnels of the Underground and deals with an invasion by robotic Yeti.https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/weboffear/detail.shtml In the 1974 Serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs, \\"Operation Golden Age\\" has its secret base hidden at the Trafalgar Square station.https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/london-pub-trivia-3 In the 1986 serial The Mysterious Planet, the Doctor and his companion discover an underground civilisation in the ruins of Marble Arch station on a future Earth.

The related 1975 series also has an episode of the same name. * There is a subgenre of horror based on subterranean humans living in disused sections of the London Underground and preying on any unlucky commuters they find. These include the 1972 film Death Line and 2004's Creep. * The secret lab in the 1970s TV series The Tomorrow People was in a disused Underground station. * In the 1981 film An American Werewolf in London, Tottenham Court Road station is among the many London landmarks where the titular werewolf attacks.https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/15-places-that-appear-in-an- american-werewolf-in-london-061617 * The 1984 Paul McCartney film Give My Regards To Broad Street includes a scene where Paul is busking outside Leicester Square Station.https://www.reelstreets.com/films/give-my-regards-to- broad-street/ * The 1987 film The Fourth Protocol features a double agent being followed on the Piccadilly line between Hyde Park Corner and Green Park, although shot on the Jubilee line between Charing Cross and Green Park. Later in the film, Michael Caine takes his vengeance out on two racist yobs who are causing disruption in the carriage in which he is travelling, this scene being shot on the Aldwych branch. * According to Kevin Kline's character Otto in the movie A Fish Called Wanda, the London Underground is a political movement. The various characters in the movie also travel on London public transport. *In the 1992 film Split Second, the London Underground is flooded with water due to the rising sea levels. Rutger Hauer and Alastair Duncan's characters are hunting a creature that has murdered people. * The 1998 film Sliding Doors shows two parallel universes, hinging on whether the central character (Gwyneth Paltrow) catches a particular train or not. Scenes were shot at Waterloo and Fulham Broadway stations. * The 1999 film Tube Tales features nine stories based on true-life experiences of London Underground passengers * The James Bond film Die Another Day (2002) features the fictional Vauxhall Cross station, which, having become defunct, is used by MI6 as a secret base. * Although most of the 2000 film Billy Elliot takes place during the 1984–1985 UK miners' strike, its epilogue takes place in the modern day, a fact presaged by the appearance of the Jubilee Line extension at its start. * In the 2002 film 28 Days Later, two of the characters use a sweetshop in the Underground station at Canary Wharf as a hideout in the early part of the film. * In the 2004 film Creep, Charing Cross station is used for the scenes in the film. * In the 2006 film V for Vendetta, Aldwych is used for some of the scenes in the film.https://www.reelstreets.com/films/v-for-vendetta/ * The Good Shepherd (2006) and Atonement (2007) include scenes shot at Aldwych. * The 2007 ITV thriller series Primeval featured the Underground in the second episode of the series.

He took the District line and the Docklands Light Railway. * The 2008 feature film Three and Out, starring Mackenzie Crook, is centred on a London Underground driver. * The James Bond film Skyfall (2012) features an action sequence in which a villain is pursued into the tube network. It was Charing Cross station and on a substantial set recreation at Pinewood Studios. * The 2013 film Thor: The Dark World featured a quick scene in which Thor finds himself teleported into Charing Cross station. * The 2014 television series 24: Live Another Day featured scenes in the London Underground where Jack Bauer chases Simone Al-Harazi from Kennington station to Waterloo station in episode 3. * In the 2014 series 3 of the BBC's Sherlock, the episode entitled \\"The Empty Hearse\\" (the first episode of the season) focuses on a potential terrorist attack that occurs in the London Underground. Throughout the episode, the Underground is mentioned numerous times, and the lead characters—Sherlock and Watson—are seen walking into Westminster station near the Palace of Westminster to stop a potential bombing on Bonfire Night (5 November). Although not \\"filmed\\" as such on the Underground, there have been two animated children's television series set on and around it. The first was Tube Mice, a 1988 series concerning the adventures of a group of mice living on the Underground. The second was the 2006 series Underground Ernie, set on a fantasy version of the network and featuring a friendly Underground supervisor and his talking trains. There was also a 2004 animated short, also called Tube Mice, about mice who keep the Underground in order.

Video games  * In the 2011 first-person shooter game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, British SAS commandos chase a hijacked underground train through the tunnel system from Canary Wharf, ending up at Westminster station. This mission entitled Mind the Gap caused controversy due to its similarities with the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London in which three explosions occurred on underground trains across London. The Jubilee line is currently the only Underground (excluding DLR) line to run through Canary Wharf and Westminster, though the level does include some overground. * A level in Tomb Raider 3 is set in the disused Aldwych station.https://core- design.com/interview2.html * The external architecture of many stations in central London are accurately rendered in The Getaway, including the surviving fragment of City Road station. * The internals of Holborn station is also used in the sequel, The Getaway: Black Monday.https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/getaway.shtml * A miniaturised version of the underground is featured in Midtown Madness 2. * The Underground features in the RPG Hellgate: London as an underground labyrinth in a demon-occupied London.

Animals are also infected by Y. pseudotuberculosis. The bacterium is urease positive. Pathogenesis In animals, Y. pseudotuberculosis can cause tuberculosis-like symptoms, including localized tissue necrosis and granulomas in the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. In humans, symptoms of Far East scarlet-like fever are similar to those of infection with Yersinia enterocolitica (fever and right-sided abdominal pain), except that the diarrheal component is often absent, which sometimes makes the resulting condition difficult to diagnose. Y. pseudotuberculosis infections can mimic appendicitis, especially in children and younger adults, and, in rare cases, the disease may cause skin complaints (erythema nodosum), joint stiffness and pain (reactive arthritis), or spread of bacteria to the blood (bacteremia). Far East scarlet-like fever usually becomes apparent five to 10 days after exposure and typically lasts one to three weeks without treatment. In complex cases or those involving immunocompromised patients, antibiotics may be necessary for resolution; ampicillin, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, or a cephalosporin may all be effective. The recently described syndrome \\"Izumi-fever\\" has been linked to infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis. The symptoms of fever and abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis (actually from mesenteric lymphadenitis) associated with Y. pseudotuberculosis infection are not typical of the diarrhea and vomiting from classical food poisoning incidents. Although Y. pseudotuberculosis is usually only able to colonize hosts by peripheral routes and cause serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, if this bacterium gains access to the blood stream, it has an LD50 comparable to Y. pestis at only 10 CFU. Relationship to Y. pestis Genetically, the pathogen causing plague, Y. pestis, is very similar to Y. pseudotuberculosis. The plague appears to have evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis about 1500 to 20,000 years ago. A 2015 paper in Cell argued for an older divergence. Virulence factors To facilitate attachment, invasion, and colonization of its host, this bacterium possesses many virulence factors. Superantigens, bacterial adhesions, and the actions of Yops (which are bacterial proteins once thought to be \\"Yersinia outer membrane proteins\\") that are encoded on the \\"[plasmid] for Yersinia virulence\\" – commonly known as the pYV – cause host pathogenesis and allow the bacteria to live parasitically. =pYV= The 70-kb pYV is critical to Yersinia's pathogenicity, since it contains many genes known to encode virulence factors and its loss gives avirulence of all Yersinia species. A 26-kb \\"core region\\" in the pYV contains the ysc genes, which regulate the expression and secretion of Yops. Many Ysc proteins also amalgamate to form a type-III secretory apparatus, which secretes many Yops into the host cell cytoplasm with the assistance of the \\"translocation apparatus\\", constructed of YopB and YopD. The core region also includes yopN, yopB, yopD, tyeA, lcrG, and lcrV, which also regulate Yops gene expression and help to translocate secretory Yops to the target cell. For example, YopN and TyeA are positioned as a plug on the apparatus so only their conformational change, induced by their interaction with certain host cell membrane proteins, will cause the unblocking of the secretory pathway. Secretion is regulated in this fashion so that proteins are not expelled into the extracellular matrix and elicit an immune response. Since this pathway gives secretion selectivity, it is a virulence factor. =Effector Yops= In contrast to the ysc and yop genes listed above, the Yops that act directly on host cells to cause cytopathologic effects – \\"effector Yops\\" – are encoded by pYV genes external to this core region. The sole exception is LcrV, which is also known as the \\"versatile Yop\\" for its two roles as an effector Yop and as a regulatory Yop. The combined function of these effector Yops permits the bacteria to resist internalization by immune and intestinal cells and to evade the bactericidal actions of neutrophils and macrophages. Inside the bacterium, these Yops are bound by pYV-encoded Sycs (specific Yop chaperones), which prevent premature interaction with other proteins and guide the Yops to a type-III secretory apparatus. In addition to the Syc-Yop complex, Yops are also tagged for type III secretion either by the first 60nt in their corresponding mRNA transcript or by their corresponding first 20 N-terminal amino acids. LcrV, YopQ, YopE, YopT, YopH, YpkA, YopJ, YopM, and YadA are all secreted by the type-III secretory pathway. LcrV inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and cytokine production, allowing Y. pseudotuberculosis to form large colonies without inducing systemic failure and, with YopQ, contributes to the translocation process by bringing YopB and YopD to the eukaryotic cell membrane for pore-formation. By causing actin filament depolymerisation, YopE, YopT, and YpkA resist endocytosis by intestinal cells and phagocytosis while giving cytotoxic changes in the host cell. YopT targets Rho GTPase, commonly named \\"RhoA\\", and uncouples it from the membrane, leaving it in an inactive RhoA-GDI (guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor)-bound state whereas YopE and YpkA convert Rho proteins to their inactive GDP-bound states by expressing GTPase activity. YpkA also catalyses serine autophosporylation, so it may have regulatory functions in Yersinia or undermine host cell immune response signal cascades since YpkA is targeted to the cytoplasmic side of the host cell membrane. YopH acts on host focal adhesion sites by dephosphorylating several phosphotyrosine residues on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and p130. Since FAK phosphorylation is involved in uptake of yersiniae as well as T cell and B cell responses to antigen-binding, YopH elicits antiphagocytic and other anti-immune effects. YopJ, which shares an operon with YpkA, \\"...interferes with the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase\\", leading to macrophage apoptosis. In addition, YopJ inhibits TNF-α release from many cell types, possibly through an inhibitory action on NF-κB, suppressing inflammation and the immune response. By secretion through a type III pathway and localization in the nucleus by a vesicle-associated, microtubule-dependent method, YopM may alter host cell growth by binding to RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase), which regulates cell cycle regulation genes. YadA has lost its adhesion, opsonisation-resisting, phagocytosis-resisting, and respiratory burst-resisting functions in Y. pseudotuberculosis due to a frameshift mutation by a single base-pair deletion in yadA in comparison to yadA in Y. enterocolitica, yet it still is secreted by type III secretion. The yop genes, yadA, ylpA, and the virC operon are considered the \\"Yop regulon\\" since they are coregulated by pYV-encoded VirF. virF is in turn thermoregulated. At 37 degrees Celsius, chromosomally encoded Ymo, which regulates DNA supercoiling around the virF gene, changes conformation, allowing for VirF expression, which then up-regulates the Yop regulon. =Adhesion= Y. pseudotuberculosis adheres strongly to intestinal cells via chromosomally encoded proteins so that Yop secretion may occur, to avoid being removed by peristalsis, and to invade target host cells. A transmembrane protein, invasin, facilitates these functions by binding to host cell αβ1 integrins. Through this binding, the integrins cluster, thereby activating FAK, and causing a corresponding reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Subsequent internalization of bound bacteria occurs when the actin-depolymerising Yops are not being expressed. The protein encoded on the \\"attachment invasion locus\\" named Ail also bestows attachment and invasive abilities upon Yersiniae while interfering with the binding of complement on the bacterial surface. To increase binding specificity, the fibrillar pH6 antigen targets bacteria to target intestinal cells only when thermoinduced. =Superantigens= Certain strains of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis express a superantigenic exotoxin, YPM, or the Y. pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen, from the chromosomal ypm gene. YPM specifically binds and causes the proliferation of T lymphocytes expressing the Vβ3, Vβ7, Vβ8, Vβ9, Vβ13.1, and Vβ13.2 variable regions with CD4+ T cell preference, although activation of some CD8+ T cells occurs. This T cell expansion can cause splenomegaly coupled with IL-2 and IL-4 overproduction. Since administering anti-TNF-α and anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibodies neutralizes YPM toxicity in vivo, these cytokines are largely responsible for the damage caused indirectly by the exotoxin. Strains that carry the exotoxin gene are rare in Western countries, where the disease, when at all apparent, manifests itself largely with minor symptoms, whereas more than 95% of strains from Far Eastern countries contain ypm and are correlated with Izumi fever and Kawasaki disease. Although the superantigen poses the greatest threat to host health, all virulence factors contribute to Y. pseudotuberculosis viability in vivo and define the bacterium’s pathogenic characteristics. Y. pseudotuberculosis can live extracellularly due to its formidable mechanisms of phagocytosis and opsonisation resistance through the expression of Yops and the type III pathway; yet, by limited pYV action, it can populate host cells, especially macrophages, intracellularly to further evade immune responses and be disseminated throughout the body. Function Yersinia pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogens (YpM) are superantigens, which are able to excessively activate T cells by binding to the T cell receptor. Since YpM can activate large numbers of the T cell population, this leads the release of inflammatory cytokines. Structure Members of this family of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis mitogens adopt a sandwich structure consisting of 9 strands in two beta sheets, in a jelly roll fold topology. YpM molecular weight is about 14 kDa. Structurally, it is unlike any other superantigen, but is remarkably similar to the tumour necrosis factor and viral capsid proteins. This suggests a possible evolutionary relationship. Subfamilies Some highly homologous variants of YPM have been characterized, including YPMa, YPMb, and YPMc. = small non-coding RNA = Numerous bacterial small non- coding RNAs have been identified to play regulatory functions. Some can regulate the virulence genes. 150 unannotated sRNAs were identified by sequencing of Y. pseudotuberculosis RNA libraries from bacteria grown at 26 °C and 37 °C, suggesting they may play a role in pathogenesis. By using single- molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation smFISH technique it was shown that the number of YSR35 RNA increased 2.5 times upon temperature shift from 25 °C to 37 °C. Another study uncovered that a temperature-induced global reprogramming of central metabolic functions are likely to support intestinal colonization of the pathogen. Environmentally controlled regulatory RNAs coordinate control of metabolism and virulence allowing rapid adaptation and high flexibility during life-style changes. High-throughput RNA structure probing identified many thermoresponsive RNA structures. = See also = * Intergenic RNA thermometer References  External links  *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis genome * *Type strain of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Yersinia Category:Bacteria described in 1889 ","title":"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis"},{"id":"3650776","text":"Right Media, Inc. is an online advertising company that operates the Right Media Exchange (RMX), a marketplace that enables advertisers, publishers, and ad networks to trade digital media.

These toilets (and other similar toilets) are a common sight in several major cities of the world, but they are perhaps most closely associated with the city of Paris, where they are ubiquitous. In the United Kingdom they (along with automated public conveniences of other brands) are known informally as \\"Superloos\\". Description The Sanisette contains a toilet behind a door that opens when a button is pressed or, in the case of a pay toilet, a coin inserted into a control panel on the outside of the toilet. A washbasin is provided (the style varies with the model of Sanisette). When a user enters the toilet, the door closes to provide privacy. After the user has finished using the toilet, they exit and the door closes again. A wash cycle then begins inside the toilet, and the toilet fixture itself is scrubbed and disinfected automatically. After about sixty seconds, the toilet is again ready for use. Special models exist for disabled users, although recent versions of Sanisettes are designed to accommodate both ambulatory users and users in wheelchairs. Some Sanisettes are designed to mount flush within a wall (sometimes seen in Paris Métro stations), or within decorative outdoor Morris columns. Most Sanisettes include indicators of their availability: ready, occupied, cycling (self-cleaning), or out of service. Sanisettes may be configured to require coins or to operate for free at the push of a button. Sanisettes are usually configured to open the door after a preset period (typically 15 minutes) to discourage vagrants. The door cannot be opened from the outside unless the Sanisette is available and a coin is inserted (or the appropriate button is pushed). A handle on the inside of the Sanisette door allows it to be opened from the inside at any time (in recent versions, the door opens at the push of a button, but there is still a handle for emergencies). Advantages and disadvantages Sanisettes replace street urinals (particularly in Paris). Their unisex design allows them to be used by both men and women, for both urination and defecation. Their self-cleaning mechanism keeps them cleaner and helps reduce odours. Some models provide recorded music for the user. The locking door provides greater privacy than many older facilities. Sanisettes carry a warning that young children must not be allowed to use the toilet alone as the weight sensor may not detect a small child, allowing the cleaning cycle to run with a child inside. Ordinary Sanisettes are too small to be used by users in wheelchairs, so special wheelchair-friendly Sanisettes have been designed. In some areas of France, Sanisettes are misused for drug dealing, drug use, and prostitution. In Paris Pre-2009 Sanisette on the avenue du Général-Leclerc in Paris. The city of Paris rents Sanisettes from a subcontractor for about €1200 per month. There are some 420 Sanisettes in the city, and they are used about three million times a year. The city pays some €6m per year to the JCDecaux company to operate and maintain the Sanisettes. Originally all Sanisettes in Paris were pay toilets, priced at 40 cent per use (in 2002). In 2003, a dozen or so Sanisettes were converted to free operation, particularly near areas where homeless people congregate. In 2004, the same conversion was carried out on the 110 Sanisettes in the city's parks and gardens. Finally, the city of Paris decided to convert all its Sanisettes to free operation beginning in mid- February 2006 (the complete conversion was finished by 2014). In 2009, the city of Paris upgraded all Sanisettes to a newer version with a number of new features and changes (pictured in this article). Sanisettes have replaced vespasiennes (street urinals) also known as pissoirs, of which there were more than 1200 in Paris back in the 1930s. The only surviving vespasienne in Paris is on the Boulevard Arago, close to the intersection with Rue de la Santé. It is still regularly used.

It was the first encyclical of his reign, and written to urge the prelates to be on guard against the dangers posed by rationalism, pantheism, socialism, Communism and other popular philosophies. It was a commentary on the widespread civil unrest spreading across Italy, as nationalists with a variety of beliefs and methods sought the unification of Italy. Context Pius IX was elected to the papacy in June 1846.

Examples The following sentences and verses possess \\"similarity in structure\\" in words and phrases: In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun \\"law\\". In the above quote, three infinitive verb phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun \\"purpose\\". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: \\"nouns with nouns, infinitive verb phrases with infinitive verb phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses.\\"Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46 When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed isocolon: Synonymous parallelism in which one couplet expresses similar concepts can also be combined with antithetical parallelism in which a second couplet contrasts with the first. For example, synonymous and antithetical parallelism occur in Revelation 22:11: :::A Let the evildoer still do evil, :::::A' and the filthy still be filthy, :::B and the righteous still do right. :::::B' and the holy still be holy. The same adverb and verb combination distinguish the couplets: “still do”/”still be”//”still do”/”still be.”James L.

Robert Lowth coined the term parallelismus membrorum (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation. Roman Jakobson pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.Jakobson, Roman. 1987. \\"The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry.\\" In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University. Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single parallel couplets as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel. In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.Chinese Poetic Literature ChinaVista, 1996-2010.

Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish- Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and Toda, suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.  In proverbs  Parallelisms in proverbs are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point. *Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

Although knives are sometimes juggled recreationally, it is generally a performance art. Knife juggling is typically seen performed by street entertainers as part of a routine, or at art or historical festivals. The knives are thrown with vertical spin, lending them stability in the air, and are typically allowed to rotate once or twice before being caught. Knife juggling can be performed with any number of objects, but the vast majority of performers use three knives. Patterns used are usually basic and consist solely of a cascade, and sometimes involve simple juggling tricks such as an under the leg throw. This is due to the unwieldy nature and increased weight of knives and the increased level of danger when compared to such props as juggling clubs. Knives used Juggling with balls and knives (circa 18th century) Juggling is rarely performed with sharp knives, because there is little point in increasing the risk to performer for no aesthetic benefit. Specially balanced juggling knives are used, usually with a bevelled edge to appear sharp. Performing with genuine machetes is not generally advised because the spin and balance are unfavourable, and tricks beyond the basics become much more difficult. Various bladed implements can be juggled, but many have a dangerous and unpredictable spin as seen on an axe or chainsaw. Such items are generally avoided, although chainsaws provide a preferable spin to axes if needs must. Juggling knives are constructed with a blade of steel or sheet aluminium several millimeters thick and a wooden or composite handle such as found on juggling clubs. The blades are often scimitar shaped with a bevelled 'cutting' edge, and the other edges are rolled to prevent injury. The other common blade shape is an elongated diamond with all edges and the point rolled or otherwise made safe. While this makes knife juggling much safer than popularly assumed, knives can still cause severe trauma injuries to the head and body when falling from a height. Because of this, the juggling of large lumps of metal should only be attempted by competent club jugglers who understand the risks.  World records  The current world records for juggling both five (103 throws and catches) and six knives (six throws and six catches) are held by Thom Wall.

March 7, 2012) was a master painter from Ecuador who used raw earthen materials such as clay and natural pigments to paint on walls and doors throughout his city when he could not afford expensive artist materials. As a teenager, Villacís taught himself drawing and composition by studying and recreating the illustrated ad posters for bullfights in Quito. In 1952, Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra, former President of Ecuador, discovered Villacís and offered him a scholarship to study in Paris. After living in Paris for almost a year, Villacís never grew accustomed to the language, so he wrote to the Ecuadorian Minister of Education requesting to transfer his studies to Madrid. Villacís felt more comfortable in Spain and lived there for six years. While living in Madrid, Villacís was introduced to the Informalismo or Informalist Movement, specifically, Antoni Tàpies, Antonio Saura, and Modest Cuixart, who quickly began to influence his work. Villacís was a co-founder of the VAN Group (Vanguardia Artística Nacional), the Informalist artist collective that embraced Informalism while searching for new modern aesthetics inspired by Pre-Columbian art (also referred to as Ancestralism or The Ancestralists). Other members of VAN included, Enrique Tábara, Estuardo Maldonado, Luis Molinari, Hugo Cifuentes, León Ricaurte and Gilberto Almeida. Villacís is mostly well known for his series called, Filigranas (Filigree), which he started in the late fifties. The Filigranas series were typically mixed media on masonite, wood or canvas with the addition of any combination of the following applied: marble dust, sand, metal, plaster, paint, gold and/or silver leaf or powder to create new modern aesthetics influenced by his Pre-Columbian ancestors. In Villacís' works made of wood he will laboriously carve into the wood to define Pre- Columbian inspired shapes and abstract symbols. Villacís will often layer many different colors of paint and then scrape some away to reveal the different colors of the layers below, giving the impression of an ancient sacred relic that has aged with time. The addition of silver and gold in Villacís' work is reminiscent of the art of the Baroque period, where the addition of these metals was often used to create a divine or sacred experience. Villacis' passion for the art and culture of the Pre-Columbian period is obvious in his work. He feels it is the beginning of life in his continent. In Pre-Columbian art there is evidence, through images and forms, of a remote life; an insight into total wisdom and enchantment. A life colored with rituals, habits and incarnated customs, signs and symbols, magic and religion through the myth. The images are constituted by the emotional, sensible perception of vitality; and the forms represent an order of the imagination and thought, governed by a rigorous construction that was built by the creative men of prehistoric times. In the seventies, Villacís began painting faces of Quito's ghetto children to highlight their \\"insecurities, uncertainty, and premature old age\\". Villacís has also been known to paint landscapes, cityscapes and bullfighting scenes. Villacís has always been intrigued by bullfighting, regularly attending bullfights in both Spain and Ecuador. Internationally, Villacís has exhibited his work throughout the corners of Latin America: Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Brazil, El Salvador, as well as the United States and Europe. In 2007, Villacís was awarded Ecuador's most prestigious honor in Art, Literature and Culture, Premio Eugenio Espejo, the National Award presented by the president of Ecuador. Villacís died on March 7, 2012 at the age of 85.

He is most widely known as an early experimenter in the field of photography. He is the first person known to have thought of creating permanent pictures by capturing camera images on material coated with a light- sensitive chemical. His practical experiments yielded only shadow image photograms that were not light-fast, but his conceptual breakthrough and partial success have led some historians to call him \\"the first photographer\\".e.g. Litchfield, book title et al.Talbot, W.H.F. (1844). The Pencil of Nature, Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, London, 1844. On page 11, Talbot acknowledges that the original 1802 account of Wedgwood and Davy's experiments, which he did not see until his own experiments were well underway, \\"...certainly establishes their claim as the first inventors of the Photographic Art, though the actual progress they made in it was small.\\" Life Thomas Wedgwood was born in Etruria, Staffordshire, now part of the city of Stoke-on-Trent in England. Wedgwood was born into a long line of pottery manufacturers, grew up and was educated at Etruria and was instilled from his youth with a love for art. He also spent much of his short life associating with painters, sculptors, and poets, to whom he was able to be a patron after he inherited his father's wealth in 1795. As a young adult, Wedgwood became interested in the best method of educating children, and spent time studying infants. From his observations, he concluded that most of the information that young brains absorbed came through the eyes, and were thus related to light and images. Wedgwood never married and had no children. His biographer notes that \\"neither his extant letters nor family tradition tell us of his caring for any woman outside the circle of his relations\\" and that he was \\"strongly attracted\\" to musical and sensitive young men. In imperfect health as a child and a chronic invalid as an adult, he died in the county of Dorset at the age of 34. A pioneer of photography Wedgwood is the first person reliably documented to have used light-sensitive chemicals to capture silhouette images on durable media such as paper, and the first known to have attempted to photograph the image formed in a camera obscura. The date of his first experiments in photography is unknown, but he is believed to have indirectly advised James Watt (1736–1819) on the practical details prior to 1800. In a letter that has been variously dated to 1790, 1791 and 1799, Watt wrote to Josiah Wedgwood: In his many experiments, possibly with advice on chemistry from his tutor Alexander Chisholm and members of the Lunar Society, Wedgwood used paper and white leather coated with silver nitrate. The leather proved to be more light-sensitive. His primary objective had been to capture real-world scenes with a camera obscura, but those attempts were unsuccessful. He did succeed in using exposure to direct sunlight to capture silhouette images of objects in contact with the treated surface, as well as the shadow images cast by sunlight passing through paintings on glass. In both cases, the sunlit areas rapidly darkened while the areas in shadow did not. Wedgwood met a young chemist named Humphry Davy (1778–1829) at the Pneumatic Clinic in Bristol, while Wedgwood was there being treated for his ailments. Davy wrote up his friend's work for publication in London's Journal of the Royal Institution (1802), titling it “An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass, and of Making Profiles, by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver, with observations by Humphrey Davy. Invented by T. Wedgwood, Esq.” The paper was published and detailed Wedgwood's procedures and accomplishments, as well as Davy's own variations of them. In 1802 the Royal Institution was not the venerable force it is today and its Journal was: Nevertheless, the paper of 1802 and Wedgwood's work directly influenced other chemists and scientists delving into the craft of photography, since subsequent research (Batchen, p. 228) has shown it was actually quite widely known about and was mentioned in chemistry textbooks as early as 1803. David Brewster, later a close friend of photography pioneer Henry Fox Talbot, published an account of the paper in the Edinburgh Magazine (Dec 1802). The paper was translated into French, and also printed in Germany in 1811. Another pioneer, J. B. Reade's work in 1839 was directly influenced by reading of Wedgwood's more rapid results when using leather. Reade tried treating paper with a tanning agent used in making leather and found that after sensitization the paper darkened more rapidly when exposed. Reade's discovery was communicated to Talbot by a friend, as was later proven in a court case over patents. The account given by Reade of his experiments was entirely retrospective. His recollection was shown to have been in error, made in 1840 and not 1839, drawn from recollections he made in 1851, more than ten years after.See R. D. Wood \\"J.B.Reade, FRS., and the early History of Photography, part II Gallic Acid and Talbot's Calotype Patent\\", from The Annals of Science Vol.27, No.1, March, 1971 There are two additional points relevant to Reade's erroneous claim: he was discussing the use of Gallic acid with silver nitrate. Silver nitrate is not a halide and unlike the chloride and fluoride of silver it has not the potential to develop the latent image. In addition Reade failed to understand or to make a distinction between tannic acid and gallic acid, referring to either \\"tincture, infusion of, or a decoction of galls\\" and gallic acid as though all were interchangeable. Any of these solutions would contain little more than 3% gallic acid, which is relatively slow acting. Tannic acid, on the other hand, which constitutes between 60 and 79% is fast acting. The result being that it would immediately act upon any gelatine present to render it insoluble; hence its use, since time immemorial, to tan leather which is a strategic material (i.e.,for solder's boots, and harness to attach guns to gun-carriages etc.). Talbot would have known of this group of organic compounds and there is evidence that he had experimented with gallic acid (2-3-4 tri-hydronitrobenzoic acid) since 1835 at the latest. First synthesised by Carl William Scheele in 1786 whose studies were widely known (earlier, in fact if you reference his experiments with secret writing).Mike Weaver, Henry Fox Talbot; Selected Texts and Bibliography (Oxford: Clio Press, Ltd., 1992): Michael Gray, Secret Writing Reade's images darkened quickly because the tannic acid component of the\\"extract of galls\\" has the power to spontaneously reduce silver nitrate to its metallic state. =Rumors of surviving photographs= Wedgwood was unable to \\"fix\\" his pictures to make them immune to the further effects of light. Unless kept in complete darkness, they would slowly but surely darken all over, eventually destroying the image. As Davy put it in his paper of 1802, the picture, Salted paper photogram of a leaf, circa 1839. A speculative attribution to Wedgwood in 2008 was later retired. Although unfixed, photographs such as Wedgwood made can be preserved indefinitely by storing them in total darkness and protecting them from the harmful effects of prolonged open exposure to the air—for example, by keeping them tightly pressed between the pages of a larger book. In the middle to late 1830s, both Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre found ways of chemically stabilizing the images their processes produced, making them relatively insensitive to additional exposure to light. In 1839, John Herschel pointed out his earlier published discovery that hyposulphite of soda (now known as sodium thiosulfate but still nicknamed \\"hypo\\") dissolved silver halides. This allowed the remaining light-sensitive silver salts to be completely washed away, truly \\"fixing\\" the photograph. Herschel also found that in the case of silver nitrate, a thorough washing with plain water sufficed to remove the unwanted remainder from paper—at least, the type of paper Herschel used—but only if the water was very pure. In 1885, Samuel Highley, an early photography historian, published an article in which he remarked that he had seen what must have been unfixed examples of early pictures made by Wedgwood, presumably dating to the 1790s. His was only one of several latter 19th century claims alleging the current or former existence of improbably early photographs, usually based on decades-old memories or depending on questionable assumptions, which investigators determined to be unverifiable, unreliable or definitely mistaken.Litchfield, appendix C. In 2008, there were widespread news reports that one of Wedgwood's photographs had surfaced and was about to be sold at auction. The photogram, as shadow photographs are now called, showed the silhouette and internal structure of a leaf and was marked in one corner with what appeared to be the letter \\"W\\". Originally unattributed, then attributed to Talbot, an essay by Talbot expert Larry Schaaf, included in the auction catalog, rejected that attribution but suggested that it could actually be by Thomas Wedgwood and date from the 1790s.An Image Is a Mystery for Photo Detectives, Randy Kennedy. New York Times, April 17, 2008. An authentic Wedgwood image would be a key historical relic, avidly sought by collectors and museums, and would probably sell for a seven-figure price at auction. Considerable controversy erupted after the announcement and Schaaf's rationale for such an attribution was vigorously disputed by other respected photography historians. A few days before the scheduled sale, the image was withdrawn so that it could be more completely analyzed.E-Photo Newsletter, Issue 148, 9/28/2008. See first two articles by Alex Novak and Michael Gray. Retrieved 7 May 2013. If any special physical analysis was later done, the findings had not been made public as of mid-2015, when Schaaf presented some new discoveries which apparently solved the major mysteries and laid his unexpectedly sensationalized scholarly speculation to rest. The initial \\"W\\", it now seems, is that of William West, an entrepreneur who was selling packets of \\"photogenic drawing paper\\" to the public only weeks after instructions for its preparation were unveiled by its inventor, Talbot, early in 1839.Schaaf, Larry.

According to an 1803 letter, Coleridge even attempted to procure cannabis for Wedgwood to alleviate his chronic stomach aches. References Bibliography * Litchfield, Richard Buckley (1903).

There are four species in the genus, primarily found in the Andean regions of South America. The name honors the German botanist Berthold Carl Seemann. Taxonomic history Seemannia was created in 1855 by Regel for the species Seemannia ternifolia (now considered a synonym of S. sylvatica). In 1976 Seemannia was synonymized under the genus Gloxinia by gesneriad specialist Hans Wiehler but has more recently been revived following phylogenetic and morphological research on relationships of Gloxinia and related genera, which suggested that Wiehler's generic concept of Gloxinia was overly broad and polyphyletic. Although now recognized as a separate genus, Seemannia is closely related to Gloxinia and hybrids between the two genera are fertile although the two genera are very distinct morphologically. Although all of the species occur in the Andes, Seemannia purpurascens is unusual in having a disjunct distribution, with populations in northern South America (Guyana, French Guiana, and northern Brazil) widely separated from Andean populations in southern Peru and Bolivia. ;Species * Seemannia gymnostoma (southern Peru, Bolivia, northern Argentina) * Seemannia nematanthodes (Bolivia, northern Argentina) * Seemannia purpurascens (southern Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, French Guiana, northern Brazil) * Seemannia sylvatica (Peru, Bolivia, northern Argentina, Paraguay, southern Brazil) References *Roalson, E.H., J.K.
