The term \\"Dereboyu\\" means \\"alongside the river\\", and although in the traditional sense this is only used for Mehmet Akif Avenue running alongside the Pedieos river, the term has expanded in meaning to denote a region extending to the neighbouring Osman Paşa Avenue. The avenue extends into the Green Line along a northwest to south axis. The part of it under Turkish Cypriot control has a length of 1,500-1,600 metres.  History  Dereboyu Avenue at night A restaurant in the avenue = British rule and independence = At the southern part of the avenue, near the Green Line today, lies a historical Armenian cemetery. Based on records, the use of this area for burial purposes is estimated to date back to the 15th century, but the graves in the area are thought to have been destroyed by the Venetian administration in the 1560s, as all that stood immediately outside the city walls was destroyed for security purposes against the imminent Ottoman attack. The first modern burials in this cemetery are thought to have taken place in around 1810. The burials continued until 1931 and the cemetery was maintained until 1963. It was known as \\"Shakespeare Avenue\\" during British rule.Keshishian, Kevork K. (1978). Nicosia: Capital of Cyprus Then and Now, Attached map, The Mouflon Book and Art Centre. Older generations referred to the avenue as \\"Mehmet Akif Avenue\\", but to describe it, the phrase \\"dere boyundaki cadde\\" (\\"the avenue along the river\\") was used as it lies along the Pedieos River. The British administration built an elevated road, named \\"Irish Bridge\\", from the avenue across the river, but the road was flooded during winter. The Cyprus Government Railway track from Morphou to Nicosia passed through the avenue. The area was known as \\"Tabakhane\\" (\\"tannery\\") or \\"Tabana\\" in the first half of the century as the tannery was located in the avenue, next to the river where a plantation now exists, having been moved there from the Tabakhane quarter of the walled city in the 19th century by the British administration. Haşmet Muzaffer Gürkan described a \\"pervading foul odor\\" in the avenue, where there were \\"no signs of life\\" apart from a few dairy farms and the tannery before the 1950s. In 1953, as the Köşklüçiftlik quarter expanded into the avenue and the first houses were built, the tannery was moved to a village. The railway track was also dismantled in 1952, leaving behind a steel bridge and a long strip of land that was then converted to a park. In 1960, Public Instrument No. 162 of the British administration declared that the widening, realigning and development of the avenue was in public interests and would be undertaken. The northern part of the Armenian cemetery was demolished in the 1960s during widening works, particularly when Fazıl Küçük moved his practice to the area 1963, which needed to be accommodated for. The name of the street was officially changed in the 1960s by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality into \\"Mehmet Akif Avenue\\" after Turkish poet Mehmet Akif Ersoy because it was \\"a remnant of the British colonial period\\". Considered to be an example of the Turkification of place names in Cyprus, the name change has provoked controversy within the context of Cypriotism. = Transformation into an entertainment centre = The avenue has become a centre of entertainment. Kutlay Erk wrote that this development had begun in the years preceding his tenure (which started in 2002). Before the development of the avenue, youths living in North Nicosia went to Kyrenia for similar entertainment. At first, the development of the avenue was hindered by a lack of space, as the restaurants could use the open space available in the summer but the space available winter was not sufficient. This led to the restaurants having to reduce their number of personnel in the winter. To solve the problem, a deal was struck by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality and the owners, according to which restaurants could set up portable partitions without building anything. However, in time, some businesses abused this permission. When Kutlay Erk was the mayor of the Nicosia Turkish Municipality, the sculpture of a Medoş tulip, endemic to Cyprus, was unveiled in the avenue. In 2011, there was a decrease in the interest of the public in the avenue, as the country was stricken by recession. However, shop owners claimed that issues such as traffic and safety due to drunk youths and occasional gangs also played a role in the decline in the business. In 2013, a roundabout at the junction with the Osman Örek Avenue was restructured.  Infrastructure and development  In 2011, there were no minibus stops on the avenue. By 2016, bus stops had been installed, but their locations were criticised as \\"inappropriate\\". In 2014, Mehmet Harmancı, the mayor of North Nicosia, stated that out of 57 businesses in the area, 26 were actively violating the city planning policy. There were problems with waste management in the region, and there are plans of building underground waste disposal centres. The issue of parking is also an important one, according to Harmancı, there are 140 parking places along the road and a project to establish automated parking machines is under consideration. It has been proposed that the plantation of the Ministry of Agriculture could be used as a car park or a public green space, but there are bureaucratic roadblocks against these proposals. In 2015, the municipality announced that a new car park for 250 cars would be opened next to the river to solve the problem of parking. In 2014, Kadri Fellahoğlu, then the mayor of North Nicosia, announced that the Turkish Cypriot military had granted the permission to build a parallel road through the military zone on the other bank of the river to ease the traffic in Dereboyu. It was then announced that after the building of the new road, the traffic in Dereboyu would become unidirectional, and new parking lots would be built across the river, as part of an extensive project of environmental restructuring. In 2015, the entrance to some of the roads branching from Dereboyu was banned to ease the traffic.  Activities  The Nicosia Marathon's route passes through the avenue.Lefkoşa maratonu yapıldı (Kıbrıs Postası) The avenue hosts bars and restaurants,Dereboyu’na yakışmadı (Kıbrıs) as well as occasional shopping festivals and concertsGençler coşacak (Kıbrıs) and the annual Nicosia Carnival. It is also used as a site for protests.Ktoeös ve Ktös, Lefkoşa sokaklarında meşaleli yürüyüş gerçekleştirdi (Kıbrıs Postası) The LGBT pride parade of North Nicosia starts in the avenue.

He won a gold medal at the 1963 Mediterranean Games. As a teenager Bezjak tried fencing and wrestling before changing to athletics. In 1953 he won the Yugoslav junior pentathlon championships, where he performed well not only in throwing, but also in sprint events, running 100 m in 11.3 and 200 m in 23.2 seconds. Next year he moved from his native Varaždin to Zagreb, and received a degree in economics there in 1960. During his hammer throwing career Bezjak had a strong rivalry with Krešimir Račić, with Bezjak winning the Yugoslav title in 1956, 1958, 1960 and 1963 and Račić in 1954, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1962 and 1964. Bezjak retired in 1965. He did not pursue a coaching career, and instead worked for the catering company Ključice in Novi Marof until 1991.

Cover The deluxe edition of the CD was released with a back to front CD case. The reason for this is that the \\"rear\\" cover, which is screen printed with a set of wavy lines, together with the reverse-packed printed CD, form a moiré pattern which can be manipulated by rotating the CD in its case. Release The album was released on 14 May 2012 in the UK. The entire album was also released for free online through SoundCloud on the same day. In February, as a taster before the release, they posted the two-minute track \\"Fourteenth Principles\\" on their SoundCloud account. Critical reception Unpatterns received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 22 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Lauren Strain of Drowned in Sound described the general sound of the album as \\"gigantic, open-armed, open-air pop, and femur-fracturing analogue techno\\". She commented on the \\"dark, uneasy undercurrent that gives everything, even the more straightforward party tracks, an edge of the ominous\\", stating that \\"this tightly controlled sense of threat, syringed out in timed doses, has always been SMD's strength\\"; opining overall that \\"Unpatterns is not without fault – the closing trio of tracks is forgettable – but it contains perhaps some of the pair's best work, and anyone who loved the nastier side of Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release but balked at Delicacies' measured gore should get back on board\\". Phelan Laurence of The Independent called the tracks on the album are \\"solid, polished [and] dancefloor- friendly\\", through did find that \\"it's only on 'Put Your Hands Together' that we're reminded of their nifty way with a vocal hook\\". The Guardians Paul MacInnes felt that \\"a lot of time has been spent on this record, and it shows: every tone has the clarity of applied refinement\\", stating that \\"this lends the album a degree of beauty, one reinforced by the delicacy of the songs' composition\\". He did, however, find that the album was \\"one step removed from club music\\", stating that barring a couple of tracks, \\"the rest is music in which to lose your thoughts, rather than your T-shirt\\". Joe Rivers of Clash found that while the album did contain \\"The hallmarks of Simian Mobile Disco\\", in that the beats and loops utilised felt the same, he felt the lack of vocals on the album was a problem, stating that \\"many of the tracks just feel like they're missing a vital component\\"; concluding \\"the individual components sound fantastic, but high audio quality does not a good record make\\".

A year later his freedom was purchased and he joined his parents in Madrid. After spending a number of years on the European continent, he returned to England where he and a group of fellow pursuivants found and delivered suspected Roman Catholics to the authorities for trial and punishment. Biography Wadsworth was the youngest son of James Wadsworth (1572?–1623), was born in Suffolk in 1604, and accompanied his mother when six years old to Spain. He was educated at Seville and Madrid, and in 1618 went to the newly founded College of the English Jesuits at St. Omer, where he remained four years. In 1622 he sailed with several other students on a mission to Spain. The ship was captured by Moorish pirates, the young men carried to Salé, and sold as slaves. Their adventures, a manuscript account of which, differing from Wadsworth's own, is at Burton Manor, Somerset, cites Hist. MSS. Comm. 1st Rep. App. p. 61. were made by the Jesuits into a \\"tragicall comedy, whereby they got much money and honour\\". cites: English Spanish Pilgrim, 1630, p. 47. Upon his release Wadsworth joined his parents at Madrid in time to serve as interpreter to James, Earl of Carlisle, who had just arrived (1623) with Prince Charles. Wadsworth's hope of permanent employment in the Infanta's suite failed with the breaking of the match; but her influence procured to him and his brother the payment of their father's pension at least for a time after his death. Philip now gave Wadsworth a commission in the army in Flanders, with a viaticum of two hundred crowns. Henceforth he styled himself \\"Captain\\", but he probably never reached the Low Countries. He made for England (December 1625), professed himself a convert from Catholicism, and offered his services at once to the Protestant Archbishop of Canterbury to infiltrate the ranks of English Catholics. The designs of the latter he promptly imparted to William Trumbull, clerk of the council. cites: Demonstrance by Captain James Waddesworth, how and in what manner he has served his King and Country, especially the Lord his Grace of Canterbury, unto the Hazard of his Life, at the P.R.O., State Papers, Charles I, vol. cxxvi. fol. 73. Proceeding to Brussels, and again in 1626 to Paris, Wadsworth was well received by Diego Gondomar and the Marquis Spinola, but after the former's death was imprisoned six months in Paris, ostensibly for debt. Upon his release, by his mother's means, he passed as a Spaniard to Calais, where he was denounced by his old schoolfellow, George Gage, as a spy of the Duke of Buckingham, and thrown into prison for ten months. There he probably commenced his English Spanish Pilgrim, and on reaching England (1628) petitioned the Earl of Pembroke, vice-chancellor, for license to make a collection in the university of Oxford to help to print it. cites: Hist. MSS. Comm. 4th Rep. App. p. 464. A few sums were received, and it appeared at London in 1629 (4to). cites: Grenville Library, Huth Cat.; 2nd edit., with a second part, Further Observations, London, 1630, 4to. From about 1629 time until about 1648, or later, Wadsworth was actively engaged as a pursuivant, even giving evidence against Laud on his trial. cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1643–4, p. 232; State Trials, iv. 547. This business appears, however, not to have been always profitable, for he presented more than one petition for moneys due out of \\"popish relics seized on his information\\", or as recompense for his bringing Jesuits and papists to conviction. cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1633–4, p. 319; Hist. MSS. Comm. 5th Rep. App. p. 102, and 6th Rep. App. p. 159; Lords' Journals, vi. 27, ix. 27. The last heard of him is Sanderson's account in Life of James I, cites Sanderson Life of James I, 1655, p. 401. \\"Mr. Waddesworth, a renegade, proselyte, Turncote of any religion, and every trade … is now living, 1655, a common Hackney to the basest Catchpole Bayliffs\\" in Westminster.

Facebook fan page of Paco Cano Biography Cano was born in Alicante, Spain, in the neighborhood of Goteta, on 18 December 1912. He was the son of Vicente Cano, who served as bullfighter with the nickname \\"Rejillas\\". His father set up a small business renting out chairs and awnings. Paco first caped a cow that had escaped from the slaughterhouse there. At 17 Cano tried his fortune as a boxer in the flyweight category. He then tried his hand in a bullfight in Alicante, as an espontáneo, or spontaneous bullfighter, and got sent to jail, but eventually had a debut alongside the novilleras, the Palmeño sisters. At a bullfight in Orihuela, Alicante, he suffered a goring. During the war, Cano lived in Madrid, entering the world of photography as a laboratory assistant at a cosmetics factory while still working as a bullfighter. Being a \\"bullfighter-photographer\\" he had the advantage of knowing two techniques: how to capture the right moment, and how to use the camera. Cano decided to leave bullfighting and dedicate himself to photography. Among those matadors photographed are Domingo Ortega, Pepe Luis Vazquez, and Luis Miguel Dominguin. Later Cano worked with publications like ABC, Hierro, La Plaza, and Aplausos. He turned 100 in December 2012. He died on 27 July 2016 at the age of 103. Manolete Cano was in Linares (Jaén), where he was the only photojournalist in Linares on the afternoon of matador Manolete's death in the ring. The images Cano took that afternoon and the next night went around the world. He earned little money for them, but Cano was forever known as the photographer of the death of Manolete. He photographed the shrouded corpse of the matador with the crucifix in his hands, and his girlfriend, Lupe Sino heartbroken. These images had great impact in the press, as most of the public only knew the Spanish bullfighter by his voice from the radio before these were published. Their story was later made into a film with Adrien Brody and Penélope Cruz, called Manolete.

Smithwick said she liked Ally because he is \\"contradictory\\" and \\"crosses a divide\\", calling him \\"sensitive\\". Smithwick described Ally as a \\"real guy's guy\\". Ally arrives in the village as a lodger for Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) and Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Both Jacqui and Rhys like Ally. Smithwick revealed that Ally would befriend Rhys and they would become \\"buddies\\". O'Connor told Kilkelly that there is a \\"good bond\\" between Ally and Rhys. The actor revealed that Ally and Rhys \\"seem to get on really well\\". It initially appears that the living arrangements are \\"quite rosy and like a perfect match\\". However, as Ally stays longer he questions whether he was right to move in with Jacqui and Rhys as they are continuously arguing. O'Connor noted the similarities between Ally and Ned Parker, the character he portrayed in Australian soap opera, Neighbours. He told Kilkelly \\"At first, it felt like I was playing the same character that I played on Neighbours, but that could just be a stereotypical Australian thing - that we all seem to be laid-back, genuine people!\\" =Relationship with Amy Barnes= Ashley Slanina-Davies (pictured) plays Ally's love interest, Amy Barnes. O'Connor told a writer from All About Soap that there is \\"definitely potential\\" for a romance to develop between Ally and another character. O'Connor was not permitted to reveal the character's identity. Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) \\"take an instant fancy\\" to Ally, who is not aware of their interest in him. O'Connor explained \\"The whole thing is pretty innocent to start off with, but it quickly gets more complicated when Ste and Amy make it their mission to find out whether Ally is gay or straight.\\" On-screen there is mystery surrounding Ally's sexuality and Ste and Amy are \\"both being ultra nice and saying suggestive things to him\\". O'Connor stated that he knows Ally's sexuality, but Hollyoaks producers told him to keep it a secret. Richardson revealed that he was \\"very heavily involved\\" in Ally's introduction to the show. O'Connor told Kilkelly that Ally would become attracted to either Ste or Amy. Ally is revealed to be heterosexual, and he asks Amy out on a date before he returns to the army. In April 2012, Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported that Ally would begin a relationship with Amy. O'Connor told a writer from Soaplife \\"They had a couple of dates and they're now in the thick of a relationship.\\" The actor added that Ally is \\"besotted\\" with Amy. Ally is \\"not bothered\\" that Amy and Ste have two children, Leah Barnes (Elá-May Melek Demircan) and Lucas Hay (Reuben Thwaites), together as he \\"likes kids\\". O'Connor told a writer from Soaplife that Ste does not want Ally to be a father figure to the Leah and Lucas. O'Connor said \\"I think Ste's feeling protective.\\" Ste interrupts Ally and Amy whilst they are on a date and asks Ally what his intentions towards Amy are. Of this, O'Connor commented \\"Ally's a bit frustrated, but he understands why Ste feels he needs to look after Amy.\\" Ally tells Ste he wants a \\"committed relationship\\" with Amy and that he \\"fell for her\\" the first time they met. In May 2012, Amy tells Ally that their relationship is progressing too fast, leaving him \\"heartbroken\\". Amy then has a one-night stand with Dodger (Danny Mac). Ally returns to see Amy the next day and hopes they can reconcile. He is unaware of her fling with Dodger, who hides on Ally's arrival. Amy refuses to reconcile to get Ally out of the flat. Amy goes on a road trip to forget about her problems, but is unaware that Dodger's cousin, Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini), has invited both Dodger and Ally on the trip. A Hollyoaks insider explained \\"Dennis has no idea that Dodger has slept with Amy when he decides to help Ally get back with her. He’s really pleased with his match-making skills but as you can imagine Amy is mortified.\\" They revealed that Amy feels \\"terrible\\" for the one-night stand, which Ally would discover. The insider added that \\"Ally feels like a total idiot\\" and attacks Dodger. =Secret= When the character of Ally was announced, it was revealed that he has a \\"dark past\\" that would be \\"uncovered eventually in true soap style\\". In January 2012, O'Connor admitted that he did not know Ally's secret and that the storyline was still being developed. O'Connor said \\"I've been told that [the secret is] a good one\\" and added that it would probably shock people. The actor opined that the secret would cause conflict between Ally and other character's. O'Connor later commented that the secret would produce a \\"very big, meaty storyline\\". In June 2012, it was reported that Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) would discover that there may be a \\"mystery connection\\" between Ally and newcomer, Walker (Neil Newbon). Lynsey sees Walker threatening Ally to keep quiet about their past and decides to investigate them. O'Connor told Matthew Wright of The Wright Stuff that Ally would lose his \\"strait-laced good boy\\" reputation. During the episode broadcast on 29 June 2012, Lynsey is found dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a whodunnit storyline, with Ally in the frame for Lynsey's murder. Digital Spy explained Ally's motives stating, \\"Additionally, [Ally] and bad boy [Walker] had both found themselves struggling to keep their secrets from an inquisitive Lynsey in recent episodes - providing them with a reason to target her.\\" A promotional image featuring Ally was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Ally as an official suspect in the mystery. =The Kane family= In October 2012, Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Hollyoaks had planned scenes involving Ally and Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke) growing close. O'Connor told a writer from Inside Soap that Ally feels \\"put out\\" by Martha's return. She is \\"out to expose Ally\\" at a time he was beginning to become liked by the Kanes. Lacey develops a crush on Ally after she steals Ash's credit card and he covers for her. The duo fall to the ground and stare at each other during a game of football. The actor explained that \\"there's a split second where there is something\\" between them. Ally gains control over the Kane household because of his encounter with Lacey. O'Connor concluded that Ally has a \\"hero complex\\" and \\"goes about everything the wrong way\\". Storylines Jacqui McQueen and Rhys Ashworth advertise for a lodger, and Ally replies to the advertisement. Jacqui and Rhys interview Ally and subsequently allow him to move in. Ally meets his neighbours, Ste Hay and Amy Barnes, and invites them over for a dinner party. Ally is unimpressed when Jacqui and Amy become drunk and ruin the party. Ally considers moving out when Jacqui and Rhys continuously argue. Ally kisses Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) and asks her out on a date, but she declines. Ally goes on the date with Mercedes' sister, Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes), instead. Ally becomes annoyed when Michaela and Amy argue as they are both attracted to him. Ally tells Michaela and Amy that he does not want to date either of them. Jacqui and Rhys' new lodger, Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill), steals Ally's laptop and Jacqui refuses to report Phoebe to the police. Jacqui and Rhys pay Ally the amount the laptop was worth and he moves out. Ally asks Amy out on a date before returning to the army. Ally returns; he and Amy begin a relationship. Ally hopes to spend time alone with Amy, but Ste interrupts them and questions Ally's intentions towards Amy. Amy tells Ally that their relationship is moving to fast and he leaves for the night. The next day, Ally attempts to reunite with Amy, unaware that she has had a one-night stand with Dodger. Amy refuses, and goes on a road trip to forget about her problems. Amy is unaware that Dodger's cousin, Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini), has invited both Dodger and Ally on the trip. Dennis hopes to reconcile Ally and Amy. Ally learns that Amy and Dodger had sex, and attacks Dodger. Ally refuses to forgive Amy and returns to the village. Ally and Amy later reunite. Ally sees Walker and recognises him as \\"Nick\\" from the army. Walker tells Ally he is mistaken. Walker threatens Ally not to reveal their past history to anyone, which Lynsey Nolan witnesses. Lynsey decides to investigate Ally and follows him to a strip club. Lynsey confronts Ally and they argue when she threatens to tell Amy. Ste overhears them arguing and decides to tell Amy. Lynsey is later found dead. Ste tells Amy about Ally and Lynsey's argument. Ally and Lynsey's argument was witnessed and the police question Ally about Lynsey's death. Amy provides an alibi for Ally, telling the police that they were together at the time Lynsey was murdered. Ally tells Amy he was at a strip club when Lynsey was murdered. Ally explains that he visits strip clubs to look out for the strippers, as his sister was a stripper and was raped by two customers. A stripper at the club verifies Ally's story to Amy and Ste. Amy tells Ally she cannot trust him and leaves. Ally then pays the stripper for covering for him. When Will Savage (James Atherton) is accused of being Lynsey's murderer, Ally leads a hate campaign against him. Ally befriends Ash Kane (Holly Weston) and they both help prove Will's innocence. Ally and Ash later share a kiss. Ally tells Amy about the kiss, explaining that he suffers from Post traumatic stress disorder and was having a panic attack when the kiss happened. Ally then ends his relationship with Amy and moves out. Ash allows Ally to stay with her. He then later sustains a relationship with Ash, and this angers Amy- so soon after they separated. Ally moves in with the Kane's and creates a rift between Martha (Carli Norris) and her children. Martha leaves the family home after an argument with Ash leaving the family struggling. Ally begins helping the family and moves in. Lacey (Georgia Bourke) develops romantic feelings for Ally and persistently tries to get his attention. Lacey tries to seduce Ally and he agrees to have sex with her. Lacey's friend Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) becomes concerned when she realises Lacey's attentions and quickly notifies Martha, who interrupts Lacey and Ally. Ash and Callum (Laurie Duncan) return home at the same time and Ally fails to explain the situation. He is later arrested for identity fraud as he had been using the identity of a dead army soldier and trying to work his way into the Kane family. Reception Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis did not agree with a viewer's criticism of O'Connor's acting, commenting that the actor had been doing a \\"stellar job\\" of portraying Ally. Anthony D. Langford writing for AfterElton stated \\"I see the show is trying to make Ally interesting by tying him into Brendan and Walker's storyline. But the character is so dull and so underwritten I don't see how it can help.\\" A reporter for the Liverpool Echo said \\"Ever since smooth-talking Ally strolled into Hollyoaks village, the suave Aussie has managed to charm his way into most of the locals' good books - but what do they really know about him? Very little, it would appear...\\" Carena Crawford from Reveal branded the character as a \\"shady Australian\\". Laura Morgan from All About Soap questioned the point of the character following his departure, saying \\"Considering we'd waited the best part of a year to discover this news, we were left a bit cold by Ally's big reveal. For a character that had a lot more potential, he was given a hurried and anti- climatic exit. In fact, Ash kneeing him in the nuts might have been the most exciting thing about the whole thing!\\" See also *List of Hollyoaks characters (2012) References External links *Ally Gorman at E4.com Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional Australian people Category:Fictional military medical personnel Category:Fictional War in Afghanistan (2001–present) veterans Category:Fictional medical personnel Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Ally Gorman"},{"id":"35818182","text":"Fahir Özgüden (1933 – 8 August 1979) was a Turkish hurdler who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

A traditional landing point for waka taua, the town is most notable now as the former home (and possible birthplace) of Major Ropata Wahawaha, N.Z.C, as well as the ancestral home of Te Whānau-a-Rākairoa. Akuaku was once a thriving settlement — the hub of the area — with a school, church, and a marae with a wharenui called Rakeiroa. Akuaku never had a road, and when Waipiro Bay's road was built in the early 20th century, Akuaku's residents began to move. The final residents of Akuaku left around 1945, and three cemeteries are all that remain of the town today. NB: ISBN given is probably a misprint in the source. Both WorldCat and Google Books list a different book with the same publisher for that ISBN, Claimant Assistance and Research Services (PDF), which has the same ISBN printed in the title page. Pre- european history Akuaku was named by Pāoa, captain of the Horouta waka, around 1350. The name is literally translated as \\"scraper\\", or to \\"scrape out\\" or \\"cleanse\\". =Ngāti Ruanuku and Pākānui= Akuaku was the sight of one of the main Ngāti Ruanuku pā, where the tribe welcomed Pākānui ashore before he eventually killed many of them in a battle at Whareponga called Te Ika-Kōpara- rua (two fish in one net). After observing Ngāti Ruanuku as their guest, Pākānui and his 90 men trapped members of the tribe, including their chief, Rangi-rākai-kura, in nets while they were fishing, before killing them with their patu. This was done for Pākānui's grandmother, Materoa, who wanted the whānau's mana restored after Ngāti Ruanuku killed her father, Poroumātā, a former resident of the area. Survivors from Ngāti Ruanuku retreated to the Waiapu Valley, where they found refuge among the Wahine-iti people while planning their attack on Pākānui. When Pākānui's scouts informed him Ngāti Ruanuku were returning to Whareponga, he put a plan into action. His warriors were concealed up small streams along the beach in between Whareponga and Akuaku's Mataahu Point, with Pākānui himself stationed at the point (at ). His brothers Riki-pāpaki and Raro-taka, who were fast runners, challenged Ngāti Ruanuku at Whareponga, then ran away towards the point. Ngāti Ruanuku chased them, and by the time they reached Pākānui, they were exhausted. At this point Pākānui's warriors emerged from their hiding place, and killed the entire party. There were so many bodies lining the beach after the battle that they formed a barrier for the sea, giving rise to the battle's name Te Tai-timu-roa (The long high-tide). The other name of the battle, Te Poho-wera (The Burnt- breast), refers to the fact that when the bodies of Ngāti Ruanuku were customarily cooked to be eaten, some of the victim's breasts were burnt. The last members of Ngāti Ruanuku were eventually killed inland up the Tapuaeroa River and at Kāhui-tara (a pā at ).Wilson, J.A.

Pākānui settled at Whareponga, building a large house from ponga trees, hence the town's name, which means \\"ponga house\\". =Te Whānau-a-Rākairoa= Māori say the Akuaku area was gifted to Rākairoa's children, Te Haemata and Pona-pātukia — the east given by Takapū-te-rakahia, and the west by Takapu-atua, daughter of Iritekura. Rākairoa is the ancestor of Te Whānau-a-Rākairoa, a hapū of Ngāti Porou that has spread widely from Akuaku. Their distribution is endearingly described as \\"Ngā wekāhu a Rākairoa\\", literally, \\"the sprawling 'couch' grass of Rākairoa\\". The hapū's proverb of identity is: > Ko Tokatea te maunga; Ko Kiekie te awa; Ko Te Whānau-a-Rākairoa te hapū; > Tihe mauri ora! > Tokatea is the mountain; Kiekie is the river; Rākairoa is the sub-tribe; > Alas, the breath of life! Katerina Naki, Sir Āpirana Ngata's mother, was a member of the hapū. Online . Major Ropata Wahawaha Major Ropata Wahawaha was born either at Akuaku or Te Puia Springs, probably around 1820, but was taken as a slave when he was a child. He moved to Akuaku in the early 1870s, and continued to live there until his death in 1897, although another source says he moved to Waiomatatini from Waipiro Bay in 1875 or 1876. Ropata died in Gisborne, and was buried in the Waiomatatini Valley. =Te Rākau i Mataahu= In 1871, Ropata Wahawaha was presented with a large Union Jack, and a sword of honour from Queen Victoria, for his services in the New Zealand Wars. On 29 July 1872 (or in June, 1871), having just returned from a ceremony in his honour in Wellington, Ropata held a hui to raise the flag. He had erected a large flag pole called Te Rākau i Mataahu to fly the flag from on Mataahu Point. The site was chosen because it was a traditional landing point for waka taua (war canoes) after returning from an expedition. The flag would be raised to alert British forces that the people were loyal to the crown, so they wouldn't be fired upon. The ceremony, held to reaffirm the loyalty of Ngāti Porou and neighbouring tribes to the Crown, was attended by three thousand people, and made Akuaku and Mataahu the centre of huge attention. Attendees swore their allegiance by marching under the flag and taking part in a service led by the Rev. Mohi Turei and Ropata himself. All but one who attended swore the oath. The lone abstainer ran away from the flag, and chanted a haka of defiance: > Tieke taretare; tieke taretare; Pō! Tū ana i waho e. > Loosely translated as: Thou ragged Jack, thou tattered Jack; Behold! I > stand aloof from thy circle. Another source quotes the haka as: > Tieke taretare pō tū mai i waho! Tū ana au i waho ma koutou e tangi ki te > kuia nei! Kāore au e tangi ki a ia! > Thou ragged Jack, behold I stand outside the circle! I stand outside thy > circle and leave you all to lament to this old lady! I will not lament her! The flagstaff was later moved to a point above the Akuaku marae. In 1960, after Akuaku had been deserted, it was moved again to nearby Kiekie Marae, where it stands today (at ). Kiekie Marae is also now in possession of Ropata's flag. =Church opening and hui= Another large hui was held at Akuaku to consecrate the church on 28 May 1884. Ropata, who had been in Gisborne, travelled back to Akuaku on the ship, the Rosina, which also brought many other prominent guests. Nearly 1,000 Māori attended, as well as many European leaders. A discussion took place about the sale of Māori land to the New Zealand Native Land Settlement Company, and whether laws and courts were necessary, given the Māori had no intention of selling the land. There were three principal speakers in the discussion. The first, John Sheehan, said that it was not a matter of if, but rather when, the land would be sold, and suggested Māori would get a better deal if they sold the land sooner, while the system was still fair. Wi Pere argued for the formation of committees to oversee ownership and possible sale of the land. Finally, Ropata Wahawaha, who \\"appeared to have no faith in the Companies or in private people, or in Government or in Parliament, or in laws, or in judges, or in public officials\\", strongly advised Māori to keep their land, pointing out that the majority of the land north of Akuaku was \\"as yet comparatively untroubled with European Speculations\\". Akuaku School Akuaku School was opened in March, 1874. A year later, while the three other Māori schools in the Waiapu district had achieved only mediocre results due to irregular attendance, Akuaku School was performing well. Its students had regular attendance records, were described as \\"clean and well dressed\\", and were well advanced in reading, writing, arithmetic and geography. At the time, the school had at least 50 students, half girls and half boys. The first teachers of the school were Mr. and Mrs. Brown.Campbell, J. H., R.M.

Retrieved 15 May 2012. Ngāti Porou tribal leader and woman of mana Materoa Reedy was a pupil at the school some time between 1888 and 1897. Later history and present day Akuaku never had a road built to it, and when a road was built to Waipiro Bay in the early 20th century, Waipiro Bay became the \\"place to be\\". Prior to that, Akuaku was larger than Waipiro Bay or Whareponga. One of the current owner of the land where Akuaku once stood is Paora Kahu Carter, who lived in Akuaku from when she was born in January, 1931, till her family moved to Waipiro Bay in 1940. When she was living there, the school and church had already gone, and the town had only six houses left — although Rakeiroa, the town's wharenui, was still in use. The Toheriri family were the last residents of Akuaku, leaving around 1945. With no one to care for it, the wharenui fell down. Former residents of Akuaku and their descendants now affiliate with nearby Kiekie Marae, where Ropata's flagpole stands today. By 2000, three urupā (cemeteries) were all that remained of Akuaku. Ropata's victim's remains had been recently exhumed and transferred to the entrance of one these cemeteries from their original burial place halfway between Akuaku and the Mataahu point. One of Akuaku's cemeteries was still in use, though difficulty getting to it — and a lack of maintenance — had led it to become an unpopular burial site. The land is currently administered by the Akuaku A3 Trust, has no one living on it, and is classified as having no current use.

The family descends from copper smith Carlos Punzo Córdoba. The two main smiths today are brothers Abdón Punzo Ángel and Ignacio Punzo Ángel, each of whom has his own workshop in which their sons and grandsons work and learn the craft of working copper and silver. Their workshops are located in the town of Santa Clara del Cobre, which is about twelve km from Pátzcuaro and part of a region with a long history of handcrafts, passed down generations. Each of the various towns has its own specialty and for Santa Clara del Cobre, it is copper working, with over fifty workshops that employ more than 300 artisans, or about eighty percent of the town's workforce. The town is known worldwide for its copper work, using traditional methods in open air workshops. Hammers, tongs and other tools are found on workshop walls and tables and the copper is heated in a large wood-fired forge.(gmasters329-330) As the region no longer mines copper, the raw material is scrap copper from old autos and cable, which he buys from telephone and electrical companies. Sledgehammers are used to pound blocks of copper to start and very fine hammers and awls are used for delicate details. Pieces are reheated as necessary as the pieces is pounded into shape. Decorative shapes such as animals are tapped outside the vessel from the inside and then backed with a substance called chapopote to keep the shape as the minute details are tapped in from the outside. Almost all of the objects are hammered into shape from a single piece or block of copper, including details like handles and decorative figures which are shaped along with the main body. This eliminates the need for soldering. The embossing, also called repoussé and chasing, is a form of decorating the basic shape of a vessel or other piece. It consists of hammering the piece from the inside to push the shape outwards. After this shape is made, details are added by chiseling and engraving. Then the copper pieces are put into a large pot of boiling water in order to give them their distinctive color. To give pieces an added shine, they are treated with sulfuric acid, soap, water and steel wool. Punzo Ángel and employee with red- hot copper piece Abdón Punzo Angel's workshop/gallery is called El Arte del Cobre on Morelos street. He is considered to be one of the best coppersmiths in Santa Clara del Cobre, working with his sons and about twelve employees. Punzo and his sons have won many awards for their work in both Mexico and abroad. He has made two presentation in Albuquerque, New Mexico . He won the Quinto Premio Nacional de la Plata 2010 Hugo Salinas Price at the Museo de Arte Popular with his son Alan Punzo Chávez winning the Galardón Nacional Joven Talento the same year. His other son, José Abdón Punzo Chávez won the Orfefrería Artesanal and Escultura Artesanal prizes. Prices for pieces run from US$40 for a platter to $900 for a large vase. All pieces are hammered into shape and hand-burnished. Work on a single piece can take two weeks. The workshop has had a number of famous clients including former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Abdón sons, José Abdon, Carlos, and Luis Felipe all began working with their father at a very young age. His son Luis Felipe Punzo Chávez has won awards for his work, for pieces that can take months to create. He is one of many artisans supported by the Casa de las Artesanías, a state agency in Morelia . Abdón Punzo states that his son Carlos Punzo Chávez has come close to beating him in past contests. On one occasion, an interview asked Abdón what he would have done if his son had beaten him and he said that it would have meant more than the prize. Ignacio Punza Ángel also is an award- winning smith who works with his sons in Santa Clara. He began learning to work copper in his father's shop as a small child and learned to work silver starting at age 17. He creates mostly large pieces with innovative designs with are often detailed. He also works in silver in which he has receive a large number of acknowledgements and awards. He has taught the craft to his three sons, José Rosaldo, José Germán and Ignacio Gabriel. He has exhibited his work in various parts of Mexico and the United States and has won the Premio Estatal de Artesanías and the Premio de Casa de las Artesanías de Morelia as well as various prizes related to the National Copper Fair held each year in Santa Clara and the National Silver Contest in Taxco .

From her marriage to the lawyer and businessman Jean-Adrien Bourlet de la Vallée she was also known as Espérance Bourlet de la Vallée. Life Door of the old church of Bonsecours Espérance Langlois was born on 19 October 1805 at Pont-de-l'Arche in Normandy. Her grandfather had been an adviser to the king of France. Her father was the artist and antiquarian Eustache-Hyacinthe Langlois. Throughout her childhood the family lived in great poverty, first in Pont-de-l'Arche and after 1816 in Rouen, while her father struggled to live by selling his work. These included drawings of old architecture and gothic-style illustrations of legends. Both Espérance and her brother Polyclès Langlois were taught by their father and often assisted him with drawings and engravings. Espérance Langlois married Jean-Adrien Bourlet de la Vallée. Their son Alexandre Bourlet de la Vallée was a classmate of Gustave Flaubert. In 1834 the Rouen Academy of Fine Arts awarded her a silver medal in the category \\"Genre works\\". Espérance was later employed for several years as a painter by the Sèvres porcelain factory. The porcelain work she made there was shown at many exhibitions of industrial art in France and England. She died on 4 December 1864 at Sèvres. Work Espérance Langlois published seven engraved plates in an 1832 book written by her father about ancient and modern paintings on glass. A book reviewer said of these engravings, \\"The beautiful and curious windows of the churches of St. Godard, the Cathedral, St. Ouen, St. Patrice, and St. Vincent in Rouen have been copied by Madamoiselle Langlois with great spirit, skill and faithfulness.\\" Another praised the beauty and exactitude of the drawings. Three plates drawn and engraved by Esperance appeared in an 1833 Histoire du Privilege de Saint-Romain. Her illustrations in her father's book Stalles de la cathédrale de Rouen, published in 1838, are the main source for the appearance of the choir stalls and misericords that were destroyed when Rouen Cathedral was bombed during World War II. Some of her engravings appeared in another book by her father on the dance of the dead, published in 1852. Other works that have been attributed to her include engravings of historical, archaeological and religious topics and oil paintings of scenery and portraits.

The 2012 Pacific hurricane season was an above-average year in which seventeen named storms formed. The hurricane season officially began on May 15 with the formation of Tropical Storm Aletta in the East Pacific—defined as the region east of 140°W—and on June 1 in the central Pacific—defined as the region west of 140°W to the International Date Line—and ended on November 30 in both basins. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form. The final cyclone of the year, Tropical Storm Rosa, dissipated on November 3\\\\. The season produced seventeen tropical storms; ten became hurricanes, and five further intensified into major hurricanes. Impact during the season was relatively minimal. In late May, Hurricane Bud paralleled the western Mexico coastline before dissipating, causing minor damage and but no reported fatalities. In mid-June, Hurricane Carlotta came ashore in Oaxaca at Category 2 hurricane intensity, making it the easternmost tropical cyclone in the basin to make landfall at hurricane intensity since 1966. The storm killed seven and caused $12.4 million (2012 USD) in damage. This timeline includes information that was not released in real time, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

Willgoose, Esq. on guitar, banjo, other stringed instruments, samplings and electronic musical instruments, Wrigglesworth on drums, piano and electronic musical instruments, and J F Abraham on flugelhorn, bass guitar, drums and assorted other instruments including a vibraslap. The band has toured internationally and in 2015 was announced as nominee in the Vanguard breakthrough category of the fourth annual Progressive Music Awards, staged by Prog magazine, which they won. History At first, the band consisted solely of Willgoose. He made his public debut at The Selkirk pub in Tooting, London, England in August 2009. Shortly afterwards he issued EP One. Teaming up with Wrigglesworth on drums the band played its first festival in September 2010, Aestival in Suffolk, and work began on a second EP, The War Room, which was released in May 2012. Since then, the band has released three albums, Inform- Educate-Entertain (2013); The Race for Space (2015); and Every Valley (2017). The Race for Space was supported by two shows at the National Space Centre in Leicester celebrating the album's launch. The album charted just outside the top 10 in 11th place in the UK in its release week and reaching Number 1 in the UK Independent Charts for that week. A follow-up EP was released at the tail end of 2015 (Sputnik/Korolev) which was backed up by a UK tour, climaxing in the band's biggest headline show, a sold-out night at the O2 Academy Brixton, of which a live album was released in 2016. While writing The War Room the band formed a close relationship with the British Film Institute, using their material during live shows. On 10 March 2017, PSB released a new single titled Progress featuring vocals from Tracyanne Campbell from Camera Obscura with photo shoots showing the band as a three-piece with new member JF Abraham featured on promotional photos. Their third studio album, entitled Every Valley, about the coal mining industry's rise and fall in the Welsh Valleys between the 1950s and 1980s, was released on 7 July 2017. As with The Race for Space, the band had two album launch concerts, this time in Ebbw Vale, where the LP was recorded. In June 2018, PSB appeared at the BBC Music \\"Big Weekend\\", playing at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. As part of this a series of four new pieces, based on the story of the , was debuted. These tracks were released as the EP White Star Liner on 26 October 2018. They performed a \\"specially commissioned new arrangement\\" of The Race for Space on 25 July 2019 in a late-night Prom, joined by London Contemporary Voices and the Multi-Story Orchestra, the performance being shown on BBC television the following night. Music style and live performances The band mostly plays instrumental music; Willgoose has said that \\"singing is never going to work. I'm not going to be happy with it, I'm not going to be comfortable playing it to other people.\\" They take samples from old public information films, archive footage and propaganda material. Despite Willgoose's prior reservations about singing, he did later contribute vocals to the duet piece \\"You + Me\\" from Every Valley, because the intended vocalist was not available.

The Republican Torres lost his bid for the seat in 2008 but prevailed in the 2010 general election with 52.5 percent of the vote, when his party gained twenty-four seats across the state. Torres was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in the primary election held on March 4, 2014. He finished last with 57,255 votes (4.7 percent). The two top votegetters, State Senator Glenn Hegar of Katy and State Representative Harvey Hilderbran of Kerrville, were expected to meet in a runoff election on May 27, 2014, pending a change in Hegar's 49.99 percent primary tabulation. However, Hilderbrand, who finished with 26 percent of the ballots cast, announced on March 7 that he was ending his campaign and endorsed Hegar as the Republican nominee. A fourth candidate in the race, Debra Medina, is an activist with the Tea Party movement and a long-time backer of Ron Paul for U.S. President. Legislative service Torres lost his initial bid for representative to the Democrat Solomon Ortiz, Jr., 59-36 percent, with the remaining 5 percent for a Libertarian contender. There were 41,635 votes cast in District 33 in 2008. In their rematch in 2010, Torres unseated Ortiz, 52.5 – 47.5 percent, in a total turnout of only 23,805. Ortiz's father, Solomon Ortiz, Sr., was also defeated in that same election for the United States House of Representatives by the Republican Blake Farenthold. Torres attributed the switch of 17 points between 2008 and 2010 to the failure of many Texas supporters of U.S. President Barack H. Obama to vote in the mid-term elections and his own willingness to campaign actively in Democratic strongholds in which he could reduce the Democratic margin of victory even if he could not carry such precincts himself. In 2011, Torres voted against HB1, the state budget, having noted that calls to his office were 10-1 against the measure. Torres has questioned the sharp increases in educational funding despite stagnant growth in the number of school pupils statewide. \\"Each year more than 130,000 Texas students enter high school and do not graduate. Often the majority of these students are minorities from a low socio-economic background. But this crisis is not just about the students in public education; it is something that will ultimately impact the entire state,\\" he warns. When redistricting placed Torres in a revised heavily Democratic District 34 with his friend and fellow freshman Republican Connie Scott, Torres decided to run instead in 2012 for the District 20 seat in the Texas State Senate held by Democrat Juan \\"Chuy\\" Hinojosa. Hinojosa defeated Torres for the Senate position in the general election held on November 6, 2012. Torres is active in local youth sports programs and is a member of the Church of Christ in Corpus Christi. He and his wife, Gina Torres, have four daughters and one son.

The Keśin (\\"long- haired one\\") are described as homeless, traveling with the wind, clad only in dust or yellow tatters, and being equally at home in the physical and the spiritual worlds. They are on friendly terms with the natural elements, the gods, enlightened beings, wild beasts, and all people.Werner 1998, p. 105. The Keśin Hymn also relates that the Keśin drink from the same magic cup as Rudra, which is poisonous to mortals.Fitzpatrick 1994, pp. 30-31. The Kesin hymn of the Rigveda is the earliest evidence of yogis and their spiritual tradition, states Karel Werner. The Hindu scripture Rigveda uses words of admiration for Kesins. Description The Keśin were lone ascetics, living a life of renunciation and wandering mendicants.Flood 1996, p. 78. Yāska (c. 500 BCE) offered several etymological meanings to Keśin, including the sun or the sun God Surya. Sāyana (c. 14th century ACE) supported that view, followed by some early European Sanskrit scholars, including H. H. Wilson and M. Bloomfield.Werner 1995, p. 36. Hermann Oldenberg took the view that the Keśin Hymn described the \\"orgiastic practices of the old Vedic times\\" and the \\"drunken rapture\\" of the Keśin.Werner 1977, pp. 291-292. Ralph T. H. Griffith and Heinrich Roth rejected both the Surya and intoxicant-drinking views. Griffith supported Roth's view of the Keśin Hymn: > The hymn shows the conception that by a life of sanctity the Muni can attain > to the fellowship of the deities of the air, the Vayu, the Rudras, the > Apsarases, and the Gandharvas; and, furnished like them with wonderful > powers, can travel along with them on their course. Werner contrasts Kesin with Rishi, both loners, but the former being the silent wandering types and the latter being the satya (truth-teaching) settled-in-a-hut types. The Keśin Hymn (RV 10, 136) The description of Keśin is found in hymn 10.136 of the Rigveda.Sanskrit Original: (Wikisource of the Keśin hymn); केश्यग्निं केशी विषं केशी बिभर्ति रोदसी । केशी विश्वं स्वर्दृशे केशीदं ज्योतिरुच्यते ॥१॥ मुनयो वातरशनाः पिशङ्गा वसते मला । वातस्यानु ध्राजिं यन्ति यद्देवासो अविक्षत ॥२॥ उन्मदिता मौनेयेन वाताँ आ तस्थिमा वयम् । शरीरेदस्माकं यूयं मर्तासो अभि पश्यथ ॥३॥ अन्तरिक्षेण पतति विश्वा रूपावचाकशत् । मुनिर्देवस्यदेवस्य सौकृत्याय सखा हितः ॥४॥ वातस्याश्वो वायोः सखाथो देवेषितो मुनिः । उभौ समुद्रावा क्षेति यश्च पूर्व उतापरः ॥५॥ अप्सरसां गन्धर्वाणां मृगाणां चरणे चरन् । केशी केतस्य विद्वान्सखा स्वादुर्मदिन्तमः ॥६॥ वायुरस्मा उपामन्थत्पिनष्टि स्मा कुनन्नमा । केशी विषस्य पात्रेण यद्रुद्रेणापिबत्सह ॥७॥ – Rigveda 10.136, 2nd millennium BCE =Ralph Griffith translation= =Karel Werner interpretation= Notes References   * Category:Rigveda Category:Hindu ascetics Category:Hindu denominations Category:Hindu mysticism Category:Shamanism Category:Yogis ","title":"Keśin"},{"id":"35818577","text":"Jeong Mun-bu (1565–1624) was a Korean statesman and patriot. In 1592, nine days into the Japanese invasion of Korea, he formed a militia to fight against the Japanese army. In 1585 Jeong passed a gwageo for the selection of officials and became an officer of the military training department of Hanseong (hanseongbupanyun). Next year, he was promoted to an officer of the book publishing department of Hongmungwan (hongmungwansuchan), and then he was in charge of dual positions, a reporting officer at Saganwon (Saganwonjeongwon) and a junghakgyosu. In 1590, he was appointed as an inspecting officer at Saheonbu (Saheonbujipyeong), also serving as a member of King's assistant group. In the next year, he was dispatched to the northeastern border as a crops commander of this region. Following the war with Japan in 1592, Guk Gyeong-in took up arms in rebellion in Hoeryong, captured and turned two princes Prince Imhae and Prince Sunhwa and their entourages Kim Gui-yeong, Hwang Jeong-uk and Hwang Hyeok over to the enemy chief Katō Kiyomasa before surrendering himself. Fuming at the revolt, Jeonng put together a righteous army with seonbis. The righteous army led by Jeonng arrested Guk and beheaded him, and then won battles at Myungchun, GilJoo and SSangpo against the Japanese army. They totally reclaimed the northeastern province by winning at Baegtapgyo in the next year. In 1624, he died while being tortured after he was arrested and falsely accused of participating in a revolt of Yi Gwal. Long after, he was posthumously reinstated after the accusation was proved unfounded.

The newspaper began as the Norristown Gazette, which published its first edition on June 15, 1799. The newspaper's first publisher was David Sower, the son of Christopher Sower, a controversial figure who published ant-war sentiments and was branded a Tory (at the time, a derogatory term for Americans loyal to the British during the American Revolution). In 1800, the name of the newspaper was changed to the \\"Norristown Herald and Weekly Advertiser\\", a name it retained in various forms until 1922, when it was merged with the Norristown Daily Times to create the Norristown Times Herald. \\"Norristown\\" was eventually dropped from the flag, and The Times Herald has evolved into a multimedia news organization, delivering local news on several platforms. The Times Herald is considered to be the 13th oldest newspaper in the nation. In 1816, David Sower Jr. purchased the Norristown Herald from his father. During his tenure as editor and publisher, David Jr. enlarged the pages and added a significant amount of office equipment. At some point he changed the name to the Norristown Herald and Montgomery county Advertiser , with, for some unknown reason, a lower-case 'c' on \\"county\\". In 1854, David Sower Jr. sold the Herald to John Hodgson of Doylestown. Hodgson built a stone building on Main Street, just east of DeKalb Street, to house the offices of the Herald. In 1837, the Free Press (a competing paper in Norristown) owner Robert Iredell bought the Norristown Herald and Weekly Advertiser, and the first edition of the Norristown Herald and Free Press was published Feb. 1, 1837. In 1864, Morgan E. Will and Robert Iredell Jr. became proprietors of the Norristown Herald and Free Press, and later that year merged with the Norristown Republican. In 1869, the Wills and Iredell partnership was dissolved, and in December of that year Wills established the Daily Herald. In 1881, the Norristown Daily Times was founded by Captain William Rennyson of Bridgeport, a Civil War veteran with no newspaper experience. In 1921, Ralph Beaver Strassburger bought the Daily Herald, and in June 1922 moved the operation to its current location on Markley Street, one block north of Main Street. In December of that same year, Strassburger purchased the Norristown Daily Times, and a week later the two papers were merged to form the Norristown Times Herald. In 1993, following the death of J.A. Peter Strassburger, his estate sold the newspaper to the Journal Register Co. That same year the paper converted to a morning edition. Early the next year a Sunday edition was added.

According to legend it was founded by Saint Brannock, a 6th- century Christian saint. It became a Grade I listed building on 25 February 1965. History The present church dates from the thirteenth century and stands on the foundations of its Saxon predecessor,Billing, Joanna, p.75, The Hidden Places of Devon Retrieved May 2012 though Christian worship on the site may date back to as early as the 6th century.Official Leaflet St Brannock was an early Christian saint who is believed to have migrated from South Wales to establish a monastery at Braunton in the 6th century. Sir John Betjeman states that St Brannoc was \\"almost certainly\\" buried beneath the high altar.Betjeman, Sir John, Betjeman’s Best British Churches Retrieved May 2012 Local tradition suggests that St Brannock originally built his church on a hill overlooking Braunton, but that the church collapsed. Following this setback, in a dream, the Saint was told to look for \\"a sow and piglets\\", and that this would be the site to build his new church. This story is commemorated in one of the stained glass windows and also in a roof boss of the church, which features a sow feeding her litter. The church was seriously damaged as a result of an arson attack in July 2003. The fire completely destroyed the gallery housing the organ pipes, which dated to the 16th century, as well as damaging pews and an antique Bible. As a result of this, services were temporarily moved to nearby Brannock Rooms while restoration work went ahead. Following the attack, posters were placed around Braunton, threatening the perpetrators with revenge. At a trial in December, three pre-teen boys were found guilty of starting the fire and given 12-month supervision orders. Architecture and fittings Nikolaus Pevsner described the church as \\"one of the most interesting, and also one of the most puzzling in North Devon\\", mentioning its massive, apparently Norman, south tower; its lead-covered broach spire, similar to that at St Peter and St Paul at Barnstaple; and the nave which despite being 34 ft wide, has no aisles. Betjeman describes the church as \\"not very prepossessing but well worth visiting\\", and as having \\"a remarkably wide nave covered by a fine roof enriched with fifteenth century bosses\\". It also boasts an early Norman font, a Jacobean pulpit, and fourteenth-century carved wooden pews, which are listed. A series of 16th-century chestnut pew ends are of carved woodwork;Betjeman, J. (ed.) (1968) Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches: the South. London: Collins; p. 159-60 one has a likeness of St Brannoc with a cow, testament to a tale surrounding him that a neighbour stole his cow, slaughtered it, put it into a stewing pot, and upon shouting the cow's name, Brannoc brought his cow back to life, reassembling it on the spot. The tower of St Brannock's Church is over 700 years old and the chancel which has an arch and three lancets is about the same age. The 15th-century south chapel has a brass palimpsest (a monumental brass that has been re- used), hinged so that both sides are visible. The church is reportedly haunted. The earliest surviving feature is a Saxon burial stone. There is a chest that may have come to England with the Spanish Armada. The church's war memorial was dedicated on 2 November 1921 in memory of soldiers from the village who died during the First World War. Constructed of stone from Somerset, it was restored in 2009. Events St Brannock's Church frequently holds musical events, including a performance by folk singer Julie Felix. It has also held exhibitions of local culture and history.

It is a part of the permanent collection at the Flint Institute of Arts. The four elements – earth, air, fire and water – were popular subjects with 17th century painters. In this painting, air is represented by a wide variety of creatures of flight, mythological figures and atmospheric conditions. A multitude of birds, including peacocks, turkeys, parrots, owls and an ostrich are shown in the painting. Several bats also appear in the painting, including one in the upper right that devours a bird while in flight. In the center of the painting, Apollo drives his chariot across the sky. Beneath him, Urania, the Muse of Astronomy, sits on a cloud, and in her left hand she holds an armillary sphere. Another of her attributes, the compass, appears on the ground next to her along with an astrolabe, a quadrant, and a cross staff, which are all instruments used for measuring the position of the planets and stars. All of this takes place in a landscape characterized by a dark, stormy sky on the left, complete with a bolt of lightning. On the right, the sky brightens over a vast expanse of trees and mountains. The composition can be traced back to a prototype developed by van Kessel's grandfather, Jan Brueghel I. Like his uncle, Jan Brueghel II, and other members of his family, van Kessel continued Jan I's work.

Their trunks are bare apart from the numerous conical knobs that each terminate in a spine. They bear clusters of compound leaves on the tips of their branches. The leaves and fruit are noticeably citrus-scented. The fruit are round capsules of about 5 mm in diameter, fully covered with glands. When they ripen they split open to release a single black and oil-rich seed. It is a host plant for the Citrus swallowtail, White-banded swallowtail and Emperor swallowtail butterflies.

The Wife of Auchtermuchty illustrated by Walter Geikie, (Early nineteenth century.) The Wife of Auchtermuchty is a Scots poem of the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. The poem narrates how a farmer, envious of his wife's apparently easy life, proposes that the couple exchange their normal responsibilities. She will work the fields and he will take care of the home. The wife agrees to the proposal and proves to be quite capable with a plough. Meanwhile, under her husband's supervision, the housework descends into comical chaos. At the end of the day, with some encouragement from his shrewd and strong-willed wife, the husband decides that he has learnt a valuable lesson and will return to his plough.The Bannatyne Manuscript, volume 2 of 4, pp. 342-345, Hunterian Club Edition, 1896. The Wife of Auchtermuchty is characterised by physical humour and wry observations on the relationship between husband and wife. In contrast to most of the works of the contemporary makars it concentrates on the life and circumstances of ordinary people. The poem gives a vivid depiction of domestic life in rural Scotland during the late medieval era. The Text The Wife of Auchtermuchty is of uncertain date and authorship. The text is found only in the Bannatyne Manuscript which dates to the latter sixteenth century and contains works of the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries. As such the poem is most likely to be of this era. In the manuscript an unidentified scribe, not George Bannatyne himself, attributes the piece to an author called only Mofat. The poem's first modern publication, with many modifications, was in The Ever Green of Allan Ramsay between 1724 and 1727.Ramsay's The Ever Green The text given in this article is that from the Bannatyne Manuscript. Historical Context The family depicted in the poem are tenant farmers in the lowlands of Scotland. They live with their livestock in a two-roomed cottage of the but and ben design. The but was an outer room, with external access, used for cooking, storage and other household work. The ben was an interior room, warmer and more comfortable than the but, used to accommodate the family. The poem predates the introduction of draught horses in Scottish agriculture. The family's plough is pulled by oxen. Synopsis =The Husband's Proposal= The narrator opens by describing a tenant farmer of Auchtermuchty who enjoys the small comforts of life. He attempts a day of ploughing in bad weather. :In Auchtermuchty thair dwelt ane man, :Ane husband as I heard it tawld, :Quha weill could tippill out a can, :And nathir luvit hungir nor cawld. :Quhill anis it fell upoun a day, :He yokkit his pluch upoun the plane, :Gif it be trew as I hard say, :The day was fowl for wind and rane. At the day's end he arrives home, weary, wet and cold, to find his wife warming herself by the fire, clean and dry, with a bowl of soup. :He lowsit the pluch at the landis end, :And draif his oxin hame at evin, :When he come in he lookit ben, :And saw the wyf baith dry and clene, :And sittand at ane fyre beikand bawld, :With ane fat soup as I hard say, :The man being wery, weit and cauld, :Between thay twa it was na play. He demands that the couple exchange their duties on the next day. The wife shall plough while he keeps the house. :Dame, ye mon to the pluch to morne, :I salbe hussy gif I may, The wife agrees and then describes what work will be required of him. The husband must tend to the livestock, sift, knead, keep their infant children clean, maintain the hearth and protect their goslings. In passing she reminds him that We have a costly farm on our head. :Husband, quho scho, content am I, :To tak the pluch my day abowt, :And ye will rowll baith kavis and ky, :And all the hous baith in and owt. :But sen that ye will husyskep ken, :First ye sall sift and syne sall kned, :And ay as ye gang but and ben, :Luk that the bairnis dryt not the bed, :Yeis lay ane soft wisp to the kill, :We haif ane deir ferme on our heid, :And ay as ye gang furth and in, :Keip weill the gaislingis fra the gled. The wife spends the rest of the evening churning a batch of butter and leaves only buttermilk instead of cream for her husband. :Scho kyrnd the kyrne and skumd it clene, :And left the gudman bot the bledoch bair, =The Wife and Husband at Work= The wife rises early the next morning and sets off for the fields carrying an unusually hearty lunch. :Than in the mornyng up scho gatt, :And on hir hairt laid hir disjune, :Scho put alsmekle in hir lap, :As micht haif servd thame baith at nune. The husband rises next and his day starts badly when five out of seven goslings are taken by a hawk. Before he can recover his composure, some calves escape their pen and start to suckle at the cattle. While separating them he is gored in the buttock by an ill willy cow. He returns home and attempts some spinning but spoils his work by sitting too close to the fire. :Quod he, this wark has ill begynning. He moves on to the churning, previously sabotaged by his wife, and unsurprisingly does not produce much butter. While he is distracted by this a sow starts to drink the buttermilk. While driving it off with a stick he accidentally bludgeons the two remaining goslings. A series of other mishaps occur before he attends to the babies and discovers that they have soiled the bed. :The first that he gat in his armis, :It was all dirt up to its ene, :The divill cutt of thair handis quod he, :That fild yow all sa fow this strene. He drags the dirty bedclothes to a burn for cleaning but they are washed away in the spate. In despair, the husband shouts to his wife in the fields for help. She pretends not to hear him and continues her ploughing until evening. :Scho hard him and scho hard him not, :Bot stowtly steird the stottis abowt, :Scho draif the day unto the nicht, :Scho lowsit the pluch and syne come hame. =The Conclusion= Upon arriving home the wife observes the chaos wrought by her husband. :Scho fand all wrang that sowld bene richt, :I trow the man thocht richt grit schame, After a quarrel the husband decides, with some persuasion from his cudgel-wielding wife, to return to his usual work. :Than up scho gat ane mekle rung, :And the gudeman maid to the dur, :Quod he, deme, I sall hald my tung, :For and we fecht ill get the woir :Quod he, quhen I forsuk my pluche, :I trow I but forsuk my seill, :And I will to my pluch agane, :For I and this hous will nevir do weill.

The book was first published in 1897 by Harper & Brothers.  Plot summary  The Durgin family, owners of a New Hampshire country house near a mountain whose peak resembles the head of a lion, plan to move to California because of a bad crop season and Mr. Durgin's ill health. As the family is packing, Mr. Westover, an artist, arrives. He pays the Durgins to stay in their home while he paints an image of the mountain. Jeff Durgin, the youngest son of the family, caters to Mr. Westover, who scolds him for scaring the nearby Whitwell children, Cynthia and Frank, with his dog. Instead of moving, Mrs. Durgin decides to change their home into a hotel; Mr. Durgin passes away in the winter before the hotel is opened. Five years later, Mr. Westovers pays another visit and is welcomed as a friend. The small country house has been renovated and expanded, and the Inn at Lion's Head is a huge success. The Whitwell family now helps run the inn. Mr. Westover catches a glimpse of Cynthia Whitwell and notices how beautiful she has become. When Jeff brings out a picnic lunch to the boarders of the hotel, Mrs. Marven, an upper class lady, does not allow him to eat with them; when Mrs. Durgin hears of this she kicks Mrs. Marven and her daughter out of the hotel. Jeff studies law at Harvard, but he is shunned by the wealthier upper-class students. He is suspended from school when he is caught with a friend who breaks a streetlight. Instead of going back to Lion's Head, he goes to Europe for the summer, and learns all about the hotels there. Once more, Mr. Westover spends the summer at Lion's head; Jeff arrives back from Europe on the same ship as wealthy Mrs. Vostrand and her daughter Genivieve. Jeff is attracted to Genivieve, but Mrs. Durgin does not allow him to associate with the upper- class boarders and sends Jeff back to Boston. The Vostrands settle in Boston, spending more and more time with Jeff Durgin. Jeff's proposes marriage to Genivieve, but she tells him that she is in love with an Italian. The Vostrands depart for Italy, leaving Jeff heartbroken. He returns to Lion's Head and is soon engaged to Cynthia, who Westover believes is far too fine for a blackguard like Jeff. Jeff tells his mother that he is content with being the Landlord at Lion's Head; she disapproves of both his low ambitions and his engagement to Cynthia. Jackson, Jeff's eldest brother, falls ill and is sent to Egypt for the winter to try to regain his health. Although Jeff no longer has plans to become a lawyer, Cynthia and Mrs. Durgin insist that he return to Harvard for his final year. Invited to an exclusive tea party, Jeff meets Bessie Lynde, an upper-class girl who finds him attractive. Bessie's brother Alan disapproves, but because of problems with alcohol is unable to intervene. At another tea party, Westover scolds Jeff for getting Alan drunk. The next day Bessie finds a doctor who sends Alan to rehab. Forgetting Cynthia, Jeff begins courting Bessie Lynde, but soon realizes that she is just out for adventure. Westover tells Jeff he must break things off with Cynthia, but Jeff decides to be honest with her in hopes that she will forgive him. She breaks off their engagement, but stays at the hotel because of her devotion to Mrs. Durgin and Jackson. Distraught, Jeff returns to Boston. On his graduation day from Harvard, Alan Lynde attacks him with a whip, injuring him badly. Jeff vows revenge against him. Jackson returns from Egypt but he is still extremely ill. Westover takes him to Lion's Head immediately and then writes to Jeff, who joins them. Jackson passes away a couple days later. Soon after, Mrs. Durgin is paralyzed by a stroke, and only Cynthia is able to understand her speech. Mrs. Durgin's dying wish is for Cynthia and Jeff to get back together, but Cynthia cannot forgive Jeff. Mrs. Durgin passes away at the end of the summer. Jeff encounters Alan Lynde, who is in rehab nearby. Tempted to kill him, he restrains himself and lets him go. Jeff then leaves on a trip to Europe, leaving Whitwell in charge of the hotel and taking out insurance. In the next chapter, Whitwell visits Westover in Boston with the news that the hotel has burned down; he fears that the insurance company may claim that he burned the hotel down to collect the payout. The Whitwell family moves to Boston. Westover hears that Genivieve has married, but has divorced because her husband beat her and treated her badly. She then meets Jeff Durgin in Europe and the two are engaged, but Mrs. Vostrand wants Westover's opinion before she approves the marriage. Westover sends a letter to Jeff in which he explains what he thinks of him. Jeff shows the letter to Mrs. Vostrand and she gives her approval. They marry, and, with Genivieve's daughter Bice, purchase the Whitwell's house and rebuild the Inn at Lion's Head. Westover's paints a portrait of Cynthia and asks for her hand in marriage. She tells him she would need to think about it and they talk it over. Cynthia tells Westover she will always need to call him Mr. Westover and the story ends.  Characters  Jeff Durgin is the youngest son of the Durgin family. Jeff is of good health compared to the rest of the men in the family. Jeff is a strong, stout good looking man and attends Harvard. He is trying to fit in amongst the upper class, but is looked at as an outsider. He is always causing trouble whether accidental or purposeful. Jere Westover is a painter who was able to climb the social ladder from country lad to an upper class painter. He acts as sort of a father figure to Jeff, but secretly dislikes him. He narrates for much of the story. Mrs. Durgin is a strong woman. She keeps the house in order and acts as both man and woman of the house. It is her dream to have Jeff go to Harvard and become a lawyer. She wants more for Jeff than what she has ever had. Cynthia Whitwell is a beautiful, smart, young woman who has enabled Jeff to get through school and into Harvard. She is a woman that always does right by everyone and does not have a single flaw in the novel. At a young age she had to act as the woman of her house because of the death of her mother and practically raised her little brother Frank. Frank Whitwell does not play a vital role in the book, but is an intelligent boy. He is always doing as he is told and plans on going into the ministry. Mr. Whitwell is a man very wary of the Durgin family, especially Jeff. He takes a great interest in the souls of dead people and loves philosophy. He is older and works for the inn by taking the women out on nature walks and teaching them of the different plants. He is very against Cynthia marrying Jeff. Jackson Durgin is a quiet man who goes about his business. He always has a sickly look to him no matter what time of year. He runs the hotel and helped make it great. One thing he is very interested in is working the planchette, a device used for contacting the souls of the dead. He dies at the age of forty. Mrs. Vostrand is a wealthy woman who cares for her children all by herself because Mr. Vostrand is never around. She showed Westover much care in Europe when he was visiting in his younger years. Her manners are impeccable as well as her daughter Genivieve's. She is a beautiful older woman. Genivieve Vostrand is a character that one never gets to know very well in the novel. She is spoken for mostly by her mother. She is very well mannered and beautiful. Jombateeste is a Canuck who only will work for Whitwell. He is a very peculiar man who loves the winter far more than the summer. He mostly tends to the horses and cuts down trees in the clearing. Bessie Lynde is a lady of class who is searching for adventure. She is being raised by her aunt because both her parents died when she was young. She is not very attractive yet there is something about her that causes Jeff to be interested in her. She is extremely smart and witty causing her to lose interest in most men quickly. Alan Lynde is the brother of Bessie Lynde. He is considered very intelligent and would be able to do anything with his life if he were able to stop drinking. He is very against Bessie's relationship with Jeff Durgin and associating with people of a lower class.  Criticism  According to Haralson, Jeff is a character unlike most of Howells' characters. Jeff has a palpable sex drive and powerful sex appeal are very unusual characteristics of a character in a Howells' piece of literature. Jeff is a \\"Beast-man\\" who Howells \\"longed to see subdued and tamed.\\" Unlike Howells' other works, by the end of the novel Jeff Durgin achieves success, starting a renaissance hotel and marrying Genivieve whom he had been pursuing for a while. Howells, a realist writer, usually does not have the protagonist succeed in the end of the novel and strays from his normal schema in this respect. According The Canadian Magazine, The Landlord at Lion's Head is written too mechanically. The Canadians took offense to the character Jombateeste—the undersized tree chopper—and believe Howells has a misconception of the weather in Canada.The Canadian magazine of politics, science, art and literature, Volume 9. By J. Gordon Mowat, John Alexander Cooper, Newton MacTavish. The Ontario Publishing Co. Limited. 1897. According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine Howells' shows literary mastery. He seemingly knows each character on a deep level and is able to convey each character's personality as if he is physically watching the events of the novel from a bird's eye view. Howells does a skillful job in allowing the reader to see the rural landscape of New Hampshire as well.Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 95. By Henry Mills Alden. Harper & Brothers. 1897. Susan Allan Toth recognizes The Landlord at Lion's Head as \\"The most neglected and misrepresented of all William Dean Howells' major novels\\". Toth believes that because the novel does not contain the social data in comparison to novels such as The Rise of Silas Lapham it has been mostly ignored. The major aspect of the story modern scholars focus on is the characterization of Jeff Durgin. Toth's article focuses on the character of Jere Westover. She points out the similarities of Westover's life with Howells' own life. Toth mentions \\"Westover's illusions seem to be those of a man who desperately wants to believe in a society in which he has struggled long and hard for acceptance; he clings to his faith like a convert.\\" Westover throughout his whole life has worked to become a man of stature and now that he has succeeded he judges everyone so critically, especially Jeff. Toth also recognizes that both Bessie Lynde and Westover have been ruined by the upper class Boston world they live in being so focused on what is proper and what is not it controls every facet of their lives. The characters Howells portrays in the novel represent the changing of times. The success of Jeff Durgin at the end of the novel is trying to depict the world heading in an \\"anti-puritan\\" direction.Colby Library Quarterly, series 11, no.2, June 1975, pg.116–128: Character and Focus in The Landlord at Lion’s Head by Susan Allen Toth. McMurray brings to our attention in \\"Point of View in Howells: A Landlord at Lion’s Head\\" that Jeff Durgin is not only viewed differently by every character in the novel, but every character has a different view of him at different times in the novel. Whitwell puts his thoughts on Jeff perfectly by saying \\"I don’t suppose a fellow’s so much to blame if he’s got the devil in him, as what the devil is.\\" Explaining Jeff in a way a country folk would understand. By the end of the story Whitwell is praising everything that Jeff has accomplished with the hotel Whitwell even says \\"I’d ought to feel good to him; and I guess that’s the way I did feel come to boil it down. He’s got a way with him, you know, when you’re with him, that makes you like him. He may have a knife in your ribs the whole while, but so long as he don’t turn it, you don’t seem to know it, and can’t help likin’ him.\\" Whitwell likes Jeff now that he bought his house from him and is no longer engaged to his daughter. Whitwell is proud of him describing all he has accomplished to Westover. He now believes people can change although Westover is still skeptical.Point of View in Howells's: The Landlord at Lion's Head by William McMurray.

It is a sequel to Machete, the third film based on a Grindhouse fake trailer and the second spin-off of the Spy Kids franchise. Danny Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, Tom Savini, Electra and Elise Avellan, Felix Sabates, and Jessica Alba reprise their roles from the first film, and are joined by series newcomers Mel Gibson, Demián Bichir, Amber Heard, Sofía Vergara, Lady Gaga, Antonio Banderas, Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Hudgens, Alexa Vega, William Sadler, Marko Zaror, and Charlie Sheen (credited by his birth name of \\"Carlos Estévez\\"). The film follows the titular ex- federal (Trejo) as he is recruited by the U.S. President (Sheen) to stop an arms dealer (Gibson) and a revolutionary (Bichir). The film was released on October 11, 2013, failing to recoup its budget of $20 million and received mixed reviews. Critics cited the overuse of plot points, poorly produced CGI, and the 'out-of-place' science fiction elements. Plot Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) attempt to capture weapon dealers who have been supplying the Mexican drug cartels. The military men are then all killed by the gangsters, who in turn are wiped out by another intervening party. Its leader murders Sartana while Machete is arrested by corrupt Sheriff Doakes (William Sadler) and Deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis). Doakes unsuccessfully tries to hang Machete but the President of the US, Rathcock (Charlie Sheen), intervenes. Machete is brought to the White House, where the president offers him US citizenship if he eliminates Marcos Mendez (Demián Bichir), a psychopath who is threatening to fire a nuclear missile at Washington, D.C. if the American government does not intervene to stop the rampant drug cartels in Mexico and the corruption of its government. Machete agrees and travels to San Antonio, where he meets his handler Blanca Vasquez (Amber Heard), an undercover beauty pageant competitor. She sends him to Acapulco to meet a young woman, Cereza (Vanessa Hudgens), who can lead him to Mendez. Machete finds her in a brothel run by her mother, Madame Desdemona (Sofía Vergara), who attempts to kill Machete before he escapes with Cereza. She takes him to Mendez's associate, Zaror (Marko Zaror), who kills Cereza before taking Machete to Mendez's base of operations. There, Machete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to Mendez' heart and triggered its launch in 24 hours. If he dies, the missile fires. After Machete kills Zaror, he also captures Mendez, intending to escort Mendez to the US and find a way to disarm the missile. Machete learns that Mendez is an ex-secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his family being tortured. The trauma drove him insane, creating his split personalities and leading him to join forces with the missile's creator. Shortly thereafter, a hit is put out on them. Machete is targeted by several assailants, including Madame Desdemona and her prostitute assassins, a shapeshifting hitman called El Camaleón, and Doakes. Machete and Mendez manage to reach the US and kill Doakes and Clebourne only to be caught by a reborn Zaror and the same mercenaries who killed Sartana. Zaror decapitates Mendez and Machete is riddled with bullets. Machete wakes up to find himself in a healing tank. He is taken to meet Zaror's benefactor—corrupt businessman, inventor and Star Wars fan Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), who reveals Zaror is a series of cloned warriors. He shows Machete Mendez's beating heart, preserved in a jar, and informs him of his plan to manipulate extremists throughout the world to detonate nuclear weapons while planning to escape in a spaceship to rebuild society in space. Machete then escapes with help from Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), who had heard about the hit on Machete. She informs him that the only one who can disarm Mendez's heart is Machete's old enemy, Osiris Amanpour (Tom Savini), who had repented and joined Luz's Network. Machete contacts Vasquez, who instructs him to meet her at a rendezvous point. Arriving there, Machete is betrayed and ambushed by Vasquez, who is in league with Voz. As she is escaping into the desert, Machete gives chase and jumps onto the top of her vehicle but falls off after gunfire comes through the roof. Machete is then given a ride by El Camaleón, who tries to kill him one last time, but he escapes and El Camaleón ends up being shot to death by a group of racist rednecks just inside the US border. Machete then reunites with Luz and the Network. They infiltrate a fundraiser at Voz's base of operations, where Voz kills Osiris. Machete realizes Voz was the one who killed Sartana and fights him. He severely burns Voz's face, disfiguring him to the extent that Voz is forced to wear a metallic, silver mask. Meanwhile, Vasquez shoots Luz in her good eye, completely blinding her. Luz kills Vasquez in return but is captured by Voz, frozen in Carbonite and taken aboard his ship. Machete jumps on the missile as it launches and disarms it in mid-air, while Voz boards the ship and departs with the Zaror clones, his supporters, as well as Luz and the surviving Network members who will be used as slave labor. The disarmed missile then plunges into the Rio Grande and Machete is rescued by President Rathcock, who asks him to follow Voz into space and kill him. Machete agrees and uses a SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket to depart to Voz's Station in Earth's orbit, where he is given a laser machete to start his mission. In a post-credits scene, an outtake from the Luz and Blanca fight scene is included followed by a shot of President Rathcock in front of a space background inquisitively brandishing two of Voz's guns (the molecular disruptor and the same pistol used to kill Sartana) before firing wildly at an off-screen target. Cast Jessica Alba reprises her role as Sartana Rivera in an uncredited cameo appearance. Production notes On June 10, 2012, Rodriguez announced that principal photography for Machete Kills had begun.MACHETE KILLS today!

The film has Charlie Sheen credited under his birth name Carlos Estévez. Expected to be a one-time move, it was Sheen's idea to use his birth name for the film, due to the film's Hispanic theme.

It released on August 17, 1988 and starred Shadoe Stevens as a mercenary turned cookie maker. The film had a budget of 6.5 million dollars and was initially intended to have a theatrical release, but was instead released direct to video. Traxx was later screened in 2012 at the Hollywood Theatre in Portland, Oregon. Plot summary Opening in 1984, Traxx (Shadoe Stevens) is a Texas State Trooper who has little respect for the rules of the police force due to perps frequently getting away with their crimes through legal technicalities or playing the \\"temporary insanity\\" case in court. As a result, Traxx makes every effort possible to kill criminals after catching them in the act which earns him scorn from his superiors. In the opening scene, Traxx is one of several troopers called to defuse a hostage situation where a deranged holdup man (Leon Rippy) has taken refuge in a pet store after shooting and killing an old lady and a puppy. Traxx storms the store and when the killer gives up and vows to plead temporary insanity, Traxx shoots and kills him anyway. After being reprimanded one too many times by the police commissioner (Hugh Gillin) for excessive use of force, Traxx quits and leaves town to become a soldier of fortune. Four years later, after battling his way through El Salvador, the Middle East, and Nicaragua and killing countless terrorists, Traxx decides to retire to a life of baking gourmet cookies in his hometown, inspired by the cookies of Wally Amos (who late in the film appears in a cameo playing himself). When he finds himself in need of money, Traxx decides to hire himself out as the \\"Town Tamer\\" and begins cleaning up his hometown of Hadleyville, Texas by killing off its lowlife street scum. Aided by fellow mercenary Deeter (Willard E. Pugh), and supported by the town mayor, Alexandra Cray (Priscilla Barnes) and the local police chief Decker (John Hancock), who agrees to pay under the books $10,000 per week to Traxx for cleaning up their town, Traxx does well with his new assassin-for-hire business. However, things do not go as smoothly as he would have hoped. Traxx's actions soon come into the attention of the local crime boss Aldo Palucci (Robert Davi). Fearing that Traxx will bring about the downfall of his business, Palucci brings in the dreaded Guzik brothers, a trio of ruthless but comic hitmen from Mexico to get rid of Traxx which leads to a climatic showdown in the streets. In the final scene, after defeating and killing Palucci and the three Guzik brothers, Traxx finally opens up his own cookie store which is called 'Snaxx by Traxx' using the reward money given for the bounty on the bad guys heads. Mayor Clay throws a large street fair to celebrate the town's centennial and its now crime-free streets. Cast *Shadoe Stevens as Traxx *Priscilla Barnes as Mayor Alexandria Cray *Willard E.

Pest Insects of our Cultural Heritage. Centre Interdisciplinaire de Conservation et de Restauration du Patrimoine. of beetles in the family Dermestidae containing the single species Thylodrias contractus, known commonly as the odd beetle and tissue paper beetle. It is native to Asia and is a widespread introduced species in North America.Ebeling, W. Chapter 8: Pests of Fabrics and Paper. Urban Entomology. University of California, Riverside. 2003. It can be a pest at times. Description T. contractus is an elongate beetle with slender legs. The male can be recognized by its yellowish-brown elytra and covering of silky, white hairs. The abdomen has seven sternal segments and the antennae are filamentous rather than club-shaped, which distinguishes it from all other members of the Dermestidae.Arnett, R., et al. American Beetles. CRC Press, New York, NY. 2002.Dillon, E. and L. Dillon. A Manual of Common Beetles of Eastern North America. Row, Peterson and Company, Elmsford, New York. 1961. The female looks very different from the male. It resembles a larva, and though it is free-living and has legs and antennae, it lacks elytra and hind wings. The larva of the odd beetle resembles that of most other Dermestidae, but it lacks a tuft of hair at the posterior end and any long hairs along the dorsal surface. At the end of each segment of the body is a row of short bristles. Natural history =Life cycle= Like all beetles, the odd beetle undergoes complete metamorphosis, or a dramatic reorganization of the body plan of the insect and the formation of two distinct life stages, growth and reproduction, which are separated by a pupal phase. Although the female is larviform, she also undergoes metamorphosis from a true larva to a sexually mature adult. Once T. contractus has reached sexual maturity, the female produces a sex pheromone which attracts the male.Mertins, J. (1982). Sex pheromone communication in the odd beetle, Thylodrias contractus Motschulsky. Journal of Chemical Ecology 8, 653-61. Once the female has mated she no longer produces this pheromone, which suggests that she mates only once. There is no indication that this is true for the male. =Behavior= The odd beetle was given its other common name, the tissue paper beetle, because it was believed to eat tissue paper. It does not actually consume tissue paper, but it may chew through it to reach objects wrapped in it. It feeds on fabrics such as wool and silk, and dried animal matter such as fur, feathers, and skin. Captive odd beetles are also known to feed on cooked beef liver.Berenbaum, M. R. Ninety-nine More Maggots, Mites, and Munchers. University of Illinois Press, Chicago, IL. 1993. The beetle is usually found in dark corners of human structures, such as drawers, cupboards, and museum displays. The odd beetle displays several behaviors as a reaction to stress. When disturbed it may roll into a ball. It may undergo retrogressive molting in stressful conditions; instead of growing larger, it grows smaller with each molt.

Brigadier John Pennycuick CB, KH (28 October 1789 – 13 January 1849) was an officer in the British Army who served in Java, Burma, Aden, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. He was born in Soilzarie in Perthshire and was killed at the Battle of Chillianwalla in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Early military career Pennycuick joined the Edinburgh militia as an ensign in 1806, and entered the regular army the following year as an ensign in the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot. He served in the Java Expedition in 1811, and was wounded in the siege of the fort at Meester Cornelis. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1812 and captain in 1821. He exchanged into the 47th Regiment of Foot in 1825 and fought in the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1825 to 1826. Promotion to major He was promoted to major in 1834, but without a regimental posting, but joined the 17th Regiment of Foot as a major the following year. He became a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1837, and served in the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839, including the Battle of Ghazni. He commanded the storming party in the capture of the Baluchi tribal fortress of Kalat on 13 November 1839. For his actions, he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1840, and was made a Commander of the Order of the Bath. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1840, and served near Aden in 1841. Second Anglo-Sikh War He exchanged from the 17th Regiment to the 24th Regiment of Foot in 1848. Later that year, he commanded a brigade in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, composed of the 24th Regiment and Bengal Native infantry battalions, in the 3rd Division commanded by Major General Joseph Thackwell (later by Sir Colin Campbell). His brigade led the attack ordered by Lord Gough at the Battle of Chillianwalla on 13 January 1849. After rushing forward without firing to seize the Sikh guns, the 24th Regiment lost touch with the rest of their brigade and was left exposed to enemy fire from the surrounding jungle. The 24th was driven back, and lost its Queen's Colour. Pennycuick and Lieutenant- Colonel Brooks of the 24th Regiment were killed, along with 20 other officers and 497 other ranks, including Pennycuick's 17-year-old son, who was serving as an ensign. Family He had married Sarah Farrell, daughter of the vicar of Rathcline, County Longford, in 1820. They had five sons and six daughters. His eldest surviving son, James Farrell Pennycuick, joined the British Army, serving in the Crimea and the Indian Mutiny, and retired as a full general. A younger son, Colonel John Pennycuick, became a British Army engineer and civil servant who also served in India. His son Alexander fell in the Battle of Chillianwala at the age 17, while defending the body of his father. His youngest son, Charles Edward Ducat Pennycuick, served as the Mayor of Colombo, the Postmaster General of Ceylon and the Treasurer of Ceylon. His grandson, John Pennycuick, was an English barrister and judge. His eldest daughter, Ruth Pennycuick married Scottish grazier and pastoralist James Bruce Gill, brother of Astronomer Sir David Gill.Burke, Bernard, Sir, 1814-1892. cn; Burke, Ashworth Peter, 1864-1919.

Here he is depicted alongside Sun Yat-sen and Victor Hugo as a Cao Đài saint. Throughout history, there were many names used to refer to Vietnam. Besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to territory of Vietnam. Vietnam was called Văn Lang during the Hùng Vương Dynasty, Âu Lạc when An Dương was king, Nam Việt during the Triệu Dynasty, Van Xuan during the Anterior Lý Dynasty, Đại Cồ Việt during the Đinh dynasty and Early Lê dynasty. Starting in 1054, Vietnam was called Đại Việt (Great Viet). During the Hồ dynasty, Vietnam was called Đại Ngu. Việt Nam ( in Vietnamese) is a variation of Nam Việt (Southern Việt), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu dynasty (2nd century BC, also known as Nanyue Kingdom). The word \\"Việt\\" originated as a shortened form of Bách Việt, a word used to refer to a people who lived in what is now southern China in ancient times. The word \\"Việt Nam\\", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm. \\"Annam\\", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer Phan Bội Châu revived the name \\"Vietnam\\" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, \\"Vietnam.\\" However, \\"Viet Nam\\" was once common usage and is still used by the United Nations and by the Vietnamese government. Origin of \\"Vietnam\\" The term \\"\\" (Yue) (), Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \\"戉\\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as \\"越\\". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular states or groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, ; ). The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book Lüshi Chunqiu compiled around 239 BC.The Annals of Lü Buwei, translated by John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel, Stanford University Press (2000), p. 510. . \\"For the most part, there are no rulers to the south of the Yang and Han Rivers, in the confederation of the Hundred Yue tribes.\\" In 207 BC, former Qin dynasty general Zhao Tuo/Triệu Đà founded the kingdom Nanyue/Nam Việt () with its capital at Panyu (modern Guangzhou). This kingdom was \\"southern\\" in the sense that it was located south of other Baiyue kingdoms such as Minyue and Ouyue, located in modern Fujian and Zhejiang. Several later Vietnamese dynasties followed this nomenclature even after these more northern peoples were absorbed into China. In \\"Sấm Trạng Trình\\" (The Prophecies of Trạng Trình), poet Nguyen Binh Khiêm (1491–1585) reversed the traditional order of the syllables and put the name in its modern form: \\"Vietnam is being created\\" ().Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm, \\"Sấm Trạng Trình\\" At this time, the country was divided between the Trịnh lords of Hanoi and the Nguyễn lords of Huế. By combining several existing names, Nam Việt, Annam (Pacified South), Đại Việt (Great Việt), and \\"Nam quốc\\" (southern nation), Khiêm could create a new name that referred to an aspirational unified state. The word \\"nam\\" no longer implies Southern Việt, but rather that Vietnam is \\"the South\\" in contrast to China, \\"the North\\". This explanation is implied by Lý Thường Kiệt in the poem \\"Nam quốc sơn hà\\" (1077): \\"Over the mountains and rivers of the South, reigns the emperor of the South.\\" Researcher Nguyễn Phúc Giác Hải found the word 越南 \\"Việt Nam\\" on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bảo Lâm Pagoda, Haiphong (1558).Thành Lân, \\"Ai đặt quốc hiệu Việt Nam đầu tiên? \\", Báo Đại đoàn kết, March 14, 2003. Nguyễn Phúc Chu (1675–1725) used the word in a poem: \\"This is the most dangerous mountain in Vietnam\\" ().Nguyễn Phúc Chu, \\"Ải lĩnh xuân vân\\". This is a reference to Hải Vân Pass. It was used as an official name by Emperor Gia Long in 1804-1813. The Vietnamese asked permission from the Qing dynasty to change the name of their country. At first, Gia Long requested the name Nam Việt, but the Jiaqing Emperor refused. The Jiaqing Emperor refused Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Việt, and changed the name instead to Việt Nam. Gia Long's Đại Nam thực lục contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming. The use of \\"Vietnam\\" was revived in modern times by nationalists including Phan Bội Châu, whose book Việt Nam vong quốc sử (History of the Loss of Vietnam) was published in 1906. Chau also founded the Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội (Vietnam Restoration League) in 1912. However, the general public continued to use Annam and the name \\"Vietnam\\" remained virtually unknown until the Yên Bái mutiny of 1930, organized by the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party).Stein Tonnesson, Hans Antlov, Asian Forms of the Nation, Routledge, 1996, pp. 117. By the early 1940s, the use of \\"Việt Nam\\" was widespread. It appeared in the name of Ho Chi Minh's Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Viet Minh), founded 1941, and was even used by the governor of French Indochina in 1942.Tonnesson & Antlov, p. 125. The name \\"Vietnam\\" has been official since 1945. It was adopted in June by Bảo Đại's imperial government in Huế, and in September by Ho's rival communist government in Hanoi.Tonnesson & Antlov, p. 126.

The 1954 edition of Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary gave both the unspaced and hyphenated forms; in response to a letter from a reader, the editors indicated that the spaced form Viet Nam was also acceptable, though they stated that because Anglophones did not know the meaning of the two words making up the name Vietnam, \\"it is not surprising\\" that there was a tendency to drop the space. In 1966, the U.S. government was known to use all three renderings, with the State Department preferring the hyphenated version. By 1981, the hyphenated form was regarded as \\"dated\\", according to Scottish writer Gilbert Adair, and he titled his book about depictions of the country in film using the unhyphenated and unspaced form \\"Vietnam\\". The modern Chinese name for Vietnam () can be translated as \\"Beyond the South\\", leading to the folk etymology that the name is a reference to the country's location beyond the southernmost borders of China. Another theory explains that the nation was termed as such in order to emphasize the division of those who stayed in China in contrast to the people living in Vietnam.\\"Introduction to Vietnam\\".

Knutton was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast. He was born at Coventry, Warwickshire. Knutton made a single first-class appearance for Warwickshire against Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston in 1894. Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat, making 238 in their first- innings, during which Knutton bowled twenty wicketless overs. Responding in their first-innings, Warwickshire made 248 all out, with Knutton being dismissed by Richard Hardstaff for 4 runs. In their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 146 all out, during which he bowled six overs. Warwickshire reached 97/4 in their second-innings, at which point the match was declared a draw. It was in this same year that he first played in the Lancashire League for Enfield, making a single appearance for the club. The following season he also made another appearance for Enfield in the league, before making a third and final appearance for the club in 1903. The year previous to that Knutton had been playing in the Bradford League when he was selected to play a hastily arranged first-class fixture for an England XI (which contained one former Test player in Willie Quaife) against the touring Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford. The fixture had only come about after the Coronation of King Edward VII had been postponed after the King had developed appendicitis, allowing a fixture to be played on the day in which the King would have been crowned. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Australians made 402 all out in their first-innings. Knutton, who was the only fast bowler in the side, finished with figures of 9/100, including taking the first eight Australian wickets to fall: Trumper, Noble, Hill, Darling, Hopkins, Duff, Armstrong, and Carter, before taking the final wicket to fall, that of Saunders. Despite this, the Australians were still able to amass a large total, mostly down to Duff's 182. Responding in their first-innings, the England XI made 240 all out, with Knutton being dismissed by Noble for 8 runs. Forced to follow-on, the England XI were dismissed for 203, with Knutton contributing being dismissed for 5 runs by the same bowler. Requiring 41 for victory, the Australians reached their target with three wickets down, one of which (Darling's) fell to Knutton. He finished with match figures of 10/117. He never appeared in first-class cricket again, but did continue to play in the Bradford League, where he took thousands of wickets. However, his high-arm brisk bowling action was sometimes regarded as suspect. He worked outside of cricket as an athletic outfitter. He died at Heaton, Yorkshire, on 12 December 1946.

It was the culmination of Bell's experiments with kites built at Baddeck, Nova Scotia. The aircraft's design combined those of the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA)'s AEA Silver Dart biplane and his AEA Cygnet kite. It was Bell's final aviation pursuit and Canada's first and only triplane design. The aircraft attempted a test flight in March 1910, but failed to achieve flight. Design and development The Oionus I had its origins in March 1909 with the dissolution of the AEA, when Alexander Graham Bell hired both Frederick W. \\"Casey\\" Baldwin as an engineer and J.A.D. McCurdy as assistant engineer to build the last of Bell's designs.Molson and Taylor 1982, p. 103. Incorporating tetrahedral sections in the structure of the triplane design continued the concept of the tetrahedral kites that had originally been tested in Bell's AEA Cygnet series that had achieved a short hop in the Cygnet III but were abandoned as a concept by Bell.Payne 2006, p. 194. The triplane design that was chosen employed a longer central plane with wingtip ailerons, with flying controls based on a fixed biplane tail and rudder at the rear and a canard biplane elevator section at the front. The internal structure was based on tubular-steel with linen-covered wings and interior sections; a four-wheel chassis or running gear formed the undercarriage. A Curtiss pusher engine drove a propeller through a chain and sprocket arrangement; later a Kirkham engine from the Baddeck No. 2 was substituted. Operational history After construction was complete in February 1910, and a new engine was installed, McCurdy readied the aircraft for flight, taking it out on some ground runs. Ballast was added to the tail and on 25 March 1910, a test flight off the ice at Baddeck Bay succeeded in three of the four wheels coming off the ground. McCurdy ended the flight in order for modification to be made for future testing, including adding more incidence to the wings. Shortly after, the ice melted and no further attempts were made to fly the Oionus I.Molson and Taylor 1982, p. 104. Specifications (Oionos I) References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Green, H. Gordon.

It was incorporated Sept. 8, 1910, by its founder, Mrs. Jean Gower, who wanted it modeled after a similar organization in London, England, called Our Dumb Friends League. In those days, the term \\"dumb\\" was widely used to refer to animals, because “they lacked the power of human speech.”Miriam- Webster Dictionary. dumb':1a The London organization has since changed its name to Blue Cross, but the Denver organization has kept its original name because it is so widely recognized in the community and because the name reflects the mission of \\"speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves.\\"  Facilities  The Dumb Friends League has three shelters for companion animals and horses. Its main shelter and administrative offices are located at the Quebec Street Shelter at 2080 S. Quebec St., Denver, Colo.

Byōbugaura is an important part of the coastal area in Chiba Prefecture, as it connects the northern point of the Pacific Ocean coast at Chōshi to Kujūkuri Beach, which covers a large portion of the western side of the prefecture. The name of the inlet is formed from the word \\"byōbu\\", the Japanese-style folding screen, and \\"ura\\", meaning an inlet. Byōbugaura resembles the White Cliffs of Dover on the English Channel. For this reason the inlet is sometimes called , or \\"Dover of the East\\". Byōbugaura is known for its long history of marine erosion. Description Byōbugaura spans approximately , with precipitous cliffs that reach an altitude of . Three strata are clearly visible on the cliffs of the inlet: the reddish Kantō Loam Stratum at the top, the Katori Statum in the middle, the chalky-white Iioka Stratum prominently on the cliff face, and the Naarai Stratum at the base. The Kantō Loam Stratum is red and is composed of material from volcanic eruptions of Mount Fuji and Mount Hakone, and the white portions of the cliff face consist of easily eroded clay. Marine erosion Byōbugaura is noted in Japan for its historical and ongoing marine erosion due to the geological character of the inlet and the near- constant violent waves of the Pacific Ocean in the area. About of land has been lost to erosion in the past 700 years. In modern times, in the 63 years between 1888 and 1951 of land have been lost. Tetrapods have been extensively installed at Byōbugaura to establish breakwaters, and have softened the retreat of land. The area of Byōbugaura on the border of Chōshi features marine caves, but most have also been lost due to marine erosion. Sanuki Castle Southern end of Byōbugaura below the Iioka Lighthouse on Cape Gyōbumi Byōbugaura was used as a defensive position overlooking the Pacific Ocean as early as the Kamakura period (1185–1333). Tsuneharu Kataoka (fl. 12th century), a grandson of the regional leader Taira no Tadatsune, used an area in front of the present-day location of Iioka Lighthouse on Cape Gyōbumi to build Sanuki Castle. Kataoka plotted against the first Kamakura shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo, and Kataoka, his family, and local supporters were defeated and killed at Sanuki Castle by members of the Chiba clan. The remains of the castle have been lost out to sea due to marine erosion. Current usage Byōbugaura makes up the southernmost part of Suigō-Tsukuba Quasi- National Park, but because of the danger of violent waves off the inlet there are few recreational facilities built in the area. Byōbugaura, due to its dramatic coastal scenery and location near Tokyo, has been extensively used as a filming location for television dramas, commercials, and film. The precinct of the Tokai Shrine, above the inlet in Chōshi, has an important old-growth forest featuring the tabu species of laurel, castanopsis, and camellia, and is a Designated Natural Area of Chiba Prefecture.

The village takes its name from the Norman Lageles family who settled in the area. Buildings of note in the village include St David's church which still possesses features dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries, the Great House which was built in the early 16th century and Horeb Welsh Presbyterian Church (1831). As a community, Laleston includes the areas of Bryntirion, Cefn Glas, Tythegston and Broadlands. The boundaries of the community are almost entirely set by transportation routes, with the western and north western border defined by the M4 motorway, where it then turns south-easterly at Stormy Down following the A48 back towards Bridgend town centre. It then takes in the Greenfields area, briefly following the banks of the River Ogmore, before heading north to Cefn Glas, but skirting Bridgend town centre and Newcastle. At the 2001 census, the community's population was 8,475, increasing to 12,586 at the 2011 Census, a 48.5% increase. Buildings of note The village of Laleston has several buildings of features of note. Clustered around the church, the village has several cottages and one larger house still recognisable as 16th century design. The Great House (Grade II), now a hotel, has its origins set in the 16th century, though the southern half of the building is more likely an additional 17th century build. St David's Church is located in the centre of the village. It shows 13th and 14th century designs, though much work has been carried out since its earliest period. The church is standard in plan with a west tower, nave and lower chancel, but the tower interior is in the Perpendicular Gothic style. A restoration of 1871 saw all the original windows replaced, and this work was completed by John Prichard, more famous for his restoration of Llandaff Cathedral. There are several rustic tablets in the church from c. 1700. The Church of St David is now a Grade I Listed building, while the churchyard cross is Grade II. Also of note is Horeb Welsh Presbyterian Church (grade II), of a long-wall facade style with two tall windows in the centre, flanked by two doors, unusual for the 1831 build. While the Laleston Inn (Grade II) on Wind Street is the only building in Glamorgan from this period designed with two serving areas on the lower level. To the north of Laleston is the field of Cae'rheneglwys, where the remains of the church once dedicated to St Cewydd, who was the Welsh equivalent of St Swithin. Governance At the local level, Laleston Community Council comprises 13 community councillors, with a Laleston/Bryntirion ward electing five of them. Prior to April 1996 Laleston was the name of an electoral ward to Ogwr Borough Council, electing three councillors. It also elected a county councillor to Mid Glamorgan County Council. Subsequent to the creation of Bridgend County Borough, Laleston was covered by the Laleston/Merthyr Mawr ward then, from 1999, by the Bryntirion, Laleston and Merthyr Mawr ward. Two county councillors are elected to the county borough council. Notable Residents (Past and Present) * Huw Ceredig (Actor) * J. J.

Background The area near Rastan was scene of the first serious armed confrontations between rebels and the Syrian Army through 2011. the Syrian Army regained control of the city several times, but it has kept slipping back into rebel hands. Its strategic location along the road which links the capital Damascus to the north of the country and the terrain had helped deserters from disparate units mount raids against Syrian army buses and roadblocks manned by Military Intelligence and pro-government militia. Events According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, on 14 May, 23 Syrian soldiers were killed in the town of Rastan in heavy clashes with rebels, who destroyed three armored personnel carriers. Earlier, opposition sources said a local rebel commander was among scores of people killed in heavy army shelling of Rastan, Reuters reported. One report said nine peopled died in the shelling. An additional two military armored personnel carriers were reportedly captured by the rebels, along with 15 soldiers.  Aftermath  In June, Syrian troops bombarded Rastan using helicopters and mortars, killing and wounding a large number of rebel fighters, including Ahmad Bahbouh, head of the rebel military office in Rastan. United Nations monitors confirmed that Syrian Air Force helicopters fired on towns near Homs, including Rastan. For the first time, the UN also verified repeated allegations by activists that government forces fired from helicopters in the military crackdown on dissent.

This season consisted of 22 episodes. It stars Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, and Rob Lowe, with supporting performances from Jim O'Heir and Retta. Season 5 focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and her staff at the parks and recreation department of the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee. Although not having an overarching storyline like Season 4, this season details the aftermath of Leslie's role as a Councilwoman in Pawnee, and her rivalry with councilman Jeremy Jamm (Jon Glaser). Other storylines include Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) and April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza)'s career move to Washington D.C., Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones)'s attempts to get pregnant, the progress in Ben and Leslie's relationship, Andy's attempts at becoming a police officer, and Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) meeting single mother Diane (Lucy Lawless). Cast =Main= * Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, is a council woman for the town of Pawnee, with a strong love of her home town, who has not let politics dampen her sense of optimism; her ultimate goal is to become President of the United States. Poehler departed from the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, where she was a cast member for nearly seven years, to star in Parks and Recreation. It was only after she was cast that Daniels and Schur established the general concept of the show and the script for the pilot was written. * Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse and political outsider who becomes Leslie's best friend and also becomes more involved in Pawnee government through her friendship with Leslie. * Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, Leslie's sarcastic and underachieving subordinate who seeks to present himself as extremely hip and trendy and always has a scheme in the works. * Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, the deadpan parks and recreation director who, as a libertarian, believes in as small a government as possible. As such, Ron strives to make his department as ineffective as possible, and favors hiring employees who do not care about their jobs or are poor at them. Nevertheless, Ron consistently demonstrates that he secretly cares deeply about his fellow co-workers. * Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate, a cynical and uninterested parks department intern who eventually becomes the perfect assistant for Ron, but leaves the department with Ben Wyatt. * Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer, a goofy and dim-witted but lovable slacker; he is April's husband. * Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt, Leslie's fiancé who leaves Pawnee for Washington, D.C., to join a political campaign. * Rob Lowe as Chris Traeger, an excessively positive and extremely health-conscious government official. =Starring= * Jim O'Heir as Jerry Gergich, a sweet-natured but painfully incompetent longtime city employee who is the main target of the office's petty unkindness, yet enjoys his life as the husband of a gorgeous woman and the father of three beautiful daughters. * Retta as Donna Meagle, a no-nonsense administrative assistant in the department, who comes from a wealthy family, and frequently mentions her many boyfriends, both past and present. Production =Filming= Portions of the season premiere \\"Ms. Knope Goes to Washington\\" and later episode \\"Leslie vs. April\\" were shot in Washington, D.C. in July 2012. These episodes featured cameo appearances from senators Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe and John McCain, and then Vice President Joe Biden. The tenth episode of the season, \\"Two Parties\\", featured scenes shot in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium and St. Elmo's Steak House in December 2012. This episode included cameos from Indianapolis Colts players Andrew Luck and Reggie Wayne and owner Jim Irsay, Indiana Pacers players Miles Plumlee and Roy Hibbert, and Newt Gingrich. =Writing= The fourteenth episode of the season, \\"Leslie and Ben\\", was initially written to serve as the season finale of a 13-episode run as the writers were unsure how many episodes would be commissioned. Eventually, 22 were ordered and the episode \\"Women in Garbage\\" was shown earlier in the schedule despite being written as one of the season's \\"back nine\\". Episodes denotes an extended episode. Reception The fifth season of Parks and Recreation received highly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a 95% approval rating with an average score of 8.72 out of 10 based on 21 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Heartfelt yet hilarious and snarky yet good-natured, Parks and Recreation remains one of the best sitcoms around and only continues to improve.

Equality Pennsylvania also attempts to \\"advance LGBT-friendly policy and legislative initiatives\\".Equality Pennsylvania About Us The organization is a member of the Equality Federation. History Equality Pennsylvania was founded by Andrew Park in 1996 in Philadelphia as the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. Upon its founding, the Center provided legal services to members of the LGBT community in Philadelphia. The organization specifically provided assistance with HIV/AIDS discrimination and transgender name-change cases for the LGBT community. The organization eventually developed into Equality Advocates PA, which helped to advocate for LGBT rights along with its previous goal of providing legal representation to the LGBT community. Equality Advocates PA was instrumental in defeating constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage in 2006 and 2008. In 2007, the organization also began to help draft LGBT non-discrimination legislation throughout the state. In 2009, the Equality Advocates PA reorganized under the name of Equality Pennsylvania. Along with changing the name of the organization, this reorganization saw the installation of a new board of directors and a new mission, which is to advocate for LGBT rights and LGBT legislation throughout Pennsylvania as a 501(c)(4) organization. The organization also reassigned its legal responsibilities to the Mazzoni Center to ensure that it could offer its complete focus to advocating for equality for LGBT individuals. In 2010, the organization hired Ted Martin to become the Executive Director and opened an office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to help expand the focus of the organization beyond Philadelphia and to allow for easier access to the General Assembly and the Governor. Following Martin's resignation in June 2017, the organization closed its Harrisburg office and established an even greater statewide network through the activation of regional chapters and with board members across the Commonwealth. Equality Pennsylvania's related entities include: * Equality Pennsylvania Education Fund (501(c)3 educational charity) * Equality Pennsylvania (501(c)4 social welfare organization) * Equality PA PAC (Political Action Committee) Activities =Endorsements= Equality Pennsylvania routinely endorses candidates seeking office both nationwide and in the state of Pennsylvania.

Receiving his early schooling in the U.K. he moved to Canada in the 1950s. While still resident in England he had received a scholarship to attend Christ's Hospital School in Horsham, Sussex. He attended classes at L'Ecole des Beaux Arts and at the Museum School of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts with Arthur Lismer. Career While living in Montreal he regularly sketched in the old port area of the city attracted by the historic buildings and streetscapes. In 1966 Batten was commissioned by Canadian Industries Limited to produce a tourists' map of that historic area in readiness for the 1967 World's Fair (Expo '67). The map was reproduced widely in both official languages. That exposure resulted in him having his first exhibition in 1967 at La Galerie Place Royale. In 1968 Batten moved to Ontario to study at the University of Toronto. = Work = He was elected to the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour (CSPWC) in 1980 and later served as the Society's President from 1993-1995.

The series was renewed for a fourth season of 13 episodes on May 10, 2012. On May 18, 2012, after returning to California from a cross-country flight, series' creator Dan Harmon received a text message alerting him that he had been relieved of his position as Community showrunner by Sony Pictures Television. Reportedly, Harmon's erratic behavior (such as his drinking, his tardiness, his falling asleep at work and his disappearing in San Francisco for a few days during the SF Sketchfest) and leadership style (namely the “tug of war between his perfectionist tendencies and his procrastinator nature”) were the reasons that the studio fired him. To replace Harmon, Sony Pictures Television hired writers David Guarascio and Moses Port, the co-creators of the short-lived CW series Aliens in America. Sony Pictures Television claimed that Harmon would serve as a consulting producer, but Harmon affirmed via his Tumblr that he would not return in a position without executive prerogatives. Regardless, Harmon was credited as an \\"executive consultant\\" for the season, despite not working on a single episode. The fourth season saw other behind-the-scenes changes, as well. Executive producers Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan, writer/producer Chris McKenna and actor/writer Dino Stamatopoulos all departed following the third season. Frequent episode directors and executive producers Anthony and Joe Russo also left in order to direct Captain America: The Winter Soldier. McKenna, Stamatopoulos, and Joe Russo later returned to work on the show's fifth season. Returning writers for fourth season included co-executive producer Andy Bobrow, producer Megan Ganz, and staff writer Tim Saccardo, who had been with the series since season two; and co-executive producer Maggie Bandur, and writing team and executive story editors Steve Basilone and Annie Mebane, who joined the series in season three. New additions to the writing staff in the fourth season included co-executive producer Ben Wexler, co- producers Hunter Covington and Gene Hong, and staff writers Issac Gonzalez and Jack Kukoda. Cast member Jim Rash (who won an Academy Award for co-writing The Descendants) wrote the eleventh episode of the season. Tristram Shapeero, who directed several episodes during the first three seasons, was promoted to an executive producer and directed the majority of the fourth season's episodes. Filming for the season began in August 2012, and the series was initially scheduled to premiere on October 19, 2012, airing in a new time slot on Fridays at 8:30 pm. In early October 2012, NBC delayed the premiere. NBC.com released a video of the cast of Community in character addressing the delay of the season premiere; this video humorously claimed that October 19 is merely a \\"state of mind\\". On October 30, 2012, NBC announced that the fourth season would premiere on February 7, 2013, returning to its original time slot of Thursdays at 8:00 pm. =Chevy Chase's departure= This was the final season to feature Chevy Chase as a series regular. During the filming of \\"Advanced Documentary Filmmaking\\", Chevy Chase became angry at the racist direction his character was heading. While venting his frustrations, he used the slur \\"nigger\\"; episode director Jay Chandrasekhar argued that Chase's use of the word was \\"political,\\" and an attempt to point out how racist his character had become. Regardless, the slur upset cast members, and Chase walked off of the set. He later returned to film some additional scenes, but later announced on November 21, 2012 that he had left the show. Note: Pertinent information appears at around the 49:00 mark. As a result of timing and the agreement made, Chase's character Pierce is absent for two episodes—he did not appear in tenth episode, \\"Intro to Knots\\", or the twelfth episode, \\"Heroic Origins\\". He also appeared in a voice-only role in the episode \\"Intro to Felt Surrogacy\\", which was the final episode produced for the season, and as part of his agreement to leave the show, Chase was required to record all audio for the scenes where his character, alongside the other characters, appeared as a puppet. The season finale, which was filmed out-of-sequence, as it was the eleventh episode produced, marked the final on-screen appearance of Chase as a regular cast member. Reception =Rating= The season premiere, \\"History 101\\", was seen by 3.88 million viewers and scored a 1.8 in the 18–49 demographic. This meant that its ratings were up when compared not only to the third season finale (which was seen by 2.48 million viewers and received a 1.3 in the 18–49 demographic), but also the aforementioned season's premiere (which was seen by 3.93 million and received a 1.7 in the 18–49 demographic). The premiere's ratings were enough to generate cautiously optimistic speculation that the show would be renewed for a fifth season (speculation that was later confirmed). However, as the season wore on, the ratings began to dip, which led some to wonder if this would be the show's last season. The season's final episode, \\"Advanced Introduction to Finality\\", was viewed by 3.08 million viewers and scored a 1.3 rating in the 18–49 demographic. =Critical reviews= The fourth season received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and is considered to be the weakest season of Community due to Harmon's absence. The fourth season scored 69 out of 100 based on 17 critics on Metacritic based on episode 1 and 3, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it was reported that 65% of critics gave the season a positive review. Verne Gay of Newsday stated, \\"Still defiantly Community, still good and still uninterested in adding new viewers.\\" On the other hand, Hitfixs Alan Sepinwall stated, \\"It feels like [Moses] Port, [David] Guarascio and the other writers decided to reverse-engineer the [Dan] Harmon version of Community, but couldn't quite manage without the missing ingredient of Harmon himself.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times has stated that the series \\"has been dumbed down, its humor broadened past recognition, and the two episodes provided for review...have fewer laughs between them than a single good scene from the old Community.\\" At the end of season 4, The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff confessed, \\"I never thought I would say this, but I just don't care anymore.\\" =Harmon's response= In an episode of Harmontown — a weekly live-comedy podcast — Harmon initially said that, while the season was an \\"impression, and an unflattering one,\\" it was merely \\"not [his] cup of tea.\\" Later in the same interview, however, he likened it to \\"'flipping through Instagram just watching your girlfriend blow everyone' and seeing a friend 'Like' a photo of your ex-girlfriend with her new boyfriend on Facebook.\\" Harmon also described the season as like \\"being held down and watching your family get raped on a beach\\". Later, in a Tumblr blog post, Harmon apologized to fans of the show, its cast and crew and the writers. He apologized for the rape comparison and for using the phrase \\"durpy durpy dur\\" in a joke about the season, saying that the phrase is \\"language used to dehumanize the developmentally disabled\\". Sony later expressed an interest in having Harmon record commentary tracks for all the fourth-season episodes, although this did not come to pass. DVD release The fourth season was released on DVD in region 1 on , in region 2 on , and in region 4 on .

It tries to simplify the software configuration management of virtualizations in order to increase development productivity. Vagrant is written in the Ruby language, but its ecosystem supports development in a few languages.  History  Vagrant was first started as a personal side-project by Mitchell Hashimoto in January 2010. The first version of Vagrant was released in March 2010. In October 2010, Engine Yard declared that they were going to sponsor the Vagrant project. The first stable version, Vagrant 1.0, was released in March 2012, exactly two years after the original version was released. In November 2012, Mitchell formed an organization called HashiCorp to support the full-time development of Vagrant; Vagrant remained permissively licensed free software. HashiCorp now works on creating commercial editions and provides professional support and training for Vagrant. Vagrant was originally tied to VirtualBox, but version 1.1 added support for other virtualization software such as VMware and KVM, and for server environments like Amazon EC2. Vagrant is written in Ruby, but it can be used in projects written in other programming languages such as PHP, Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript. Since version 1.6, Vagrant natively supports Docker containers, which in some cases can serve as a substitute for a fully virtualized operating system.  Architecture  Vagrant uses \\"Provisioners\\" and \\"Providers\\" as building blocks to manage the development environments. Provisioners are tools that allow users to customize the configuration of virtual environments. Puppet and Chef are the two most widely used provisioners in the Vagrant ecosystem (Ansible has been available since at least 2014). Providers are the services that Vagrant uses to set up and create virtual environments. Support for VirtualBox, Hyper-V, and Docker virtualization ships with Vagrant, while VMware and AWS are supported via plugins. Vagrant sits on top of virtualization software as a wrapper and helps the developer interact easily with the providers. It automates the configuration of virtual environments using Chef or Puppet, and the user does not have to directly use any other virtualization software. Machine and software requirements are written in a file called \\"Vagrantfile\\" to execute necessary steps in order to create a development-ready box. \\"Box\\" is a format and an extension ( .box) for Vagrant environments that is copied to another machine in order to replicate the same environment.

Chesnutt. The novel is published by Doubleday, Page, & Co. in 1905. The Colonel's Dream portrays the continuing oppression and racial violence prominent in the Southern United States after the American Civil War. The Colonel's Dream concerns Colonel Henry French and his attempt to refine Clarendon, North Carolina, the southern city in which he grew up, into a racially and socially equal society from the strictly segregationist ways of its past. The novel portrays the characters' intertwined lives through Charles Chesnutt's use of melodramatic subplots and provides a larger picture of life in post-Civil War North Carolina where black people as not given the same opportunities, offered the same fair wages, or treated fairly. In the novel, it is shown how white people have a general \\"fear of 'nigger domination'\\" specifically in politics, possibly giving reason for black oppression. It is the last novel by Chesnutt to be published in his lifetime. Dedication Plot summary The novel begins with Colonel Henry French and his partners selling their company, making the colonel financially independent. He decides to head back south with his son, Phil. He intends to stay for only a couple of months, but once he arrives, he remembers with nostalgia the landscape, the building structures, and his youth in his hometown. He runs into his old slave, Peter French, who is finding it difficult to make a living due to his skin color and age under the post-war conditions. During his stay, the Colonel sees continuing economic isolation and repression of the black population and is bothered by the racism that is still very prominent in Clarendon. The editor of the local newspaper talked to him about Clarendon having \\"so many idle, ignorant Negroes that something must be done to make them work, or else they'll steal, and to keep them in their place, or they would run over us\\".Chesnutt, Charles W. The Colonel's Dream. Ed. SallyAnn H. Ferguson. New Milford: Toby Press, 2004. Print. (p. 73). It became evident to the Colonel that there was a racial problem in Clarendon. When the Colonel visits a black school, he hears from a black school teacher, Mr. Henry Taylor, how unfairly the school system treats blacks by segregation and difference in condition of the schools. Behind most of this wrongdoing is William Fetters, a convict labor contractor in Clarendon who influences most affairs in the town. The Colonel takes on the injustice of Fetters and tries to change Clarendon into a more socially equal town. While in Clarendon, the Colonel also gets himself into some romantic problems. Graciella, after turning down Ben Dudley, tries to entice the wealthy Colonel to marry her. Colonel French proposes to Laura, deeming her as a loving mother to Phil. Laura accepts the proposal with happiness, but asks to keep the engagement secret for a while. The Colonel tries to stimulate the economy of Clarendon by getting more black people working for him under better conditions and higher wages. The Colonel learns from one worker that blacks worked \\"from twelve to sixteen hours a day for fifteen to fifty cents\\".Chesnutt, Charles W. The Colonel's Dream. Ed. SallyAnn H. Ferguson. New Milford: Toby Press, 2004. Print. (p. 108). Driven by a desire for more equality between blacks and whites, he also pursues owning parts of Clarendon by purchasing additional properties, such as a run down cotton mill and his childhood home, for which he pays a mulatto barber named William Nichols well over the actual price. (Nichols was actually created from the image of Chesnutt's wife's father, who was also a barber.)Chesnutt, Charles W. To Be An Author: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905. Ed. Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997. Print. (p. 12). Filled with abhorrence for the strength and prominence of the white supremacy of his childhood town, the Colonel works to undo the efforts of William Fetters. The Colonel imagines building a library for the black population of ex-slaves as well as fixing up white schools. However, Laura convinces him not to, reminding him of the violence that would come from white residents. As Laura predicted, the plans of the Colonel to reconstruct Clarendon are met with strong opposition and hostility. Peter dies trying to save Phil from being hit by a train while chasing a cat on the train tracks. Phil dies soon after from his injuries.Phil requests to his father was he and Peter be buried in the same graveyard next to each other. In defense of Peter's burial in an all-white cemetery, the Colonel remarks how all men are seen as equal under God regardless of skin color.Chesnutt, Charles W. The Colonel's Dream. Ed. SallyAnn H. Ferguson. New Milford: Toby Press, 2004. Print. (p. 249). After the burial, Peter's casket appears on the front lawn of the Colonel's house with a note from a group of white townspeople who refused social equality among the races, warning the Colonel to leave Clarendon. This incident discourages him further. The schoolteacher tells the Colonel about Bud Johnson, a convict laborer working unlawfully under Mr. Fetters. After offering to pay for his freedom and being turned down by Mr. Fetters, the Colonel devises a plan to help Johnson escape. However, instead of escaping, Johnson tries to kill Mr. Fetters' son. After being found out, a mob of white racists lynches Johnson. Nearing his death, Malcolm Dudley only has Viney at his side. Viney, having faked being mute for years, finally reveals that she can speak, telling Malcolm there was no gold to be found. She also reveals that she did this scheming to get back at him for having her whipped and lying about freeing her from slavery despite their romantic involvement when they were younger. Malcolm forgives her and passes away. Viney is found dead next to him as well. These mishaps finally cause the Colonel to see the hopelessness of trying to change the \\"violence, cruelty, and race hatred\\" of the South, and that segregation would always be ingrained.Andrews, William L. The Literary Career of Charles W. Chesnutt. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1980. Print. (p. 247). All seems lost to the Colonel with his failed ventures. With his beloved son dead, there is no use in marrying Laura anymore. All that resulted from his presence in Clarendon was more violence and increased racial hatred. So, the Colonel returns to New York City and resumes his business with Mr. Kirby and Mrs. Jerviss, whom he ends up marrying instead. Coincidentally, while on a train to Chicago on business, the Colonel runs into Henry Taylor. He tells the Colonel that he had become a Pullman car porter because he was compelled to escape the South. This implies that the only way for black people to escape the racial cruelty of the South was by fleeing from it and, in Henry Taylor's case, taking a lesser position in society. Main characters * Colonel Henry French – a former high-ranking Confederate soldier in the Civil War and retired merchant * Mr. Kirby, Mrs. Jerviss – his former partners at French and Company, Ltd. in New York City * Philip French – the colonel's young son * Peter French – the colonel's former slave * Mrs. Treadwell – an old lady who lives leisurely * Miss Laura Treadwell – daughter of Mrs. Treadwell * Graciella Treadwell – granddaughter of Mrs. Treadwell * Malcolm Dudley – a treasure-seeker who is in search of buried gold * Ben Dudley – Malcolm's nephew desperate to win Graciella's hand in marriage * Viney – Dudley's mulatto housekeeper since she was a child * William Fetters – a former plantation overseer and black convict labor contractor * Barclay Fetters – William's son * Bud Johnson – a black convict laborer * Caroline – Johnson's wife * Henry Taylor – a freeman's schoolmaster * William Nichols – a mulatto barber * Haynes – a constableChesnutt, Charles W. The Colonel's Dream. Ed. SallyAnn H. Ferguson. New Milford: Toby Press, 2004. Print. (p. 5). Themes The primary theme of The Colonel's Dream is the strength of racial prejudice and white supremacy that overcame the South after the Civil War where black oppression was still clearly present. The Colonel's Dream uses the story of a man who wants to return to his childhood home of Clarendon, North Carolina and make a new living there to illustrate the racial problems that pervaded the South during the beginning of the 20th century. \\"The art of The Colonel's Dream, however, lies in Charles W. Chesnutt's greater willingness and ability to broach a radical solution to White violence in a New South setting\\".Chesnutt, Charles W. The Colonel's Dream. Ed. SallyAnn H. Ferguson. New Milford: Toby Press, 2004. Print. (p. xxii). Throughout the novel, it is easy to understand the \\"social inequalities and political injustice\\" that thrived in Clarendon, North Carolina as a representation of the South as a whole.Andrews, William L. The Literary Career of Charles W. Chesnutt. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1980. Print. (p. 134). Chesnutt dramatically portrays the hardships and violence that plagued the deeply segregated South at the time. Throughout, the novel illustrates that after the Civil War, Blacks remained low in social ranking performing menial work. Socio-economic problems made the Southern situation even worse. For example, white people of Clarendon were unwilling to allow black people education with the educational system as a whole completely worn down. Another example is how unfairly the black people were being treated in not being given the same wages as white people who worked the same jobs. A major theme that becomes evident at the end of the novel is the hopelessness of trying to change black oppression in the South, a theme Chesnutt shares with his former mentor Albion Tourgée, author of A Fool's Errand whose hero Colonel Comfort Servosse is by and large replicated as Colonel Henry French in Chesnutt's novel.Koy, Christopher E. “You is got a monst’us heap ter l’arn yit”: Charles Chesnutt’s Revisions of Albion Tourgée’s ‘Carpetbagger’ and ‘White Negro’ Characters. American and British Studies Annual 2010, 87-95. Print. (p. 90). Colonel French is the image of a man who Charles Chesnutt would have to reform the South. \\"Charles Chesnutt also portrays his own colonel as racially ambivalent, supporting blacks and a progressive New South on the one hand, while also needing romantic, old South racism on the other\\".Chesnutt, Charles W. The Colonel's Dream. Ed. SallyAnn H. Ferguson. New Milford: Toby Press, 2004. Print. (p. xviii). Colonel French is a man who once fought for the South but saw a more free and equal society when he moved north to New York City after the Civil War. He represented the northern force that would attempt to bring justice to the South. However, in the end, it is hopelessness and failure that prevail in an uncorrectable South. Other themes related to the post-Civil War South emerge through Chesnutt's use of melodramatic subplots such as the \\"melodramatic subplot involving interracial love and lost inheritance\\" with Malcolm Dudley searching for gold and having a romantic history with his mulatto housekeeper Viney.Andrews, William L. The Literary Career of Charles W. Chesnutt. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1980. Print. (p. 135). This subplot illustrates the theme of how love between the two different races was forbidden and looked down upon. Malcolm Dudley's search for buried treasure also shows how desperate people were to escape the poverty of the South. Critical reception The Colonel's Dream is regarded as one of the novels that led to the end of Charles Chesnutt's career due to poor sales.Chesnutt, Charles W. An Exemplary Citizen: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1906-1932. Ed. Jesse S. Crisler, Robert C. Leitz, III, and Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002. Print. (p. xxiii). Even Chesnutt accepted The Colonel's Dream as a failure, as he wrote in one letter to a Mr. Benjamin G. Brawley on July 29, 1914 that the book \\"was not a pronounced success\\".Chesnutt, Charles W. An Exemplary Citizen: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1906-1932. Ed. Jesse S. Crisler, Robert C. Leitz, III, and Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002. Print. (p. 118). There were many \\"typographical errors\\" in the first few printings of the novel that both Chesnutt and the publishing company of Doubleday, Page, & Co. missed, including misspelling of characters' names and a misspelling on the cover.Chesnutt, Charles W. To Be An Author: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905. Ed. Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997. Print. (p. 228). This may have contributed to weak sales. It is known that fewer copies of The Colonel's Dream were sold than Chesnutt's best-known novel, The Marrow of Tradition (1901), which sold fewer than four thousand copies.Chesnutt, Charles W. An Exemplary Citizen: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1906-1932. Ed. Jesse S. Crisler, Robert C. Leitz, III, and Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002. Print. (p. xix).

Only two genera of lumbricid earthworms are indigenous to North America while introduced genera have spread to areas without any native species, especially in the north where forest ecosystems rely on a large amount of undecayed leaf matter. When worms decompose that leaf layer, the ecology may shift making the habitat unsurvivable for certain species of trees, ferns and herbs. Larger earthworms such as the nightcrawler Lumbricus terrestris and the Alabama jumper, Amynthas agrestis, can be eaten by adult salamanders, which is beneficial for their populations, but they are too large for juvenile salamanders to consume, which leads to a net loss in salamander population.Crawling to Oblivion, Scientific American, 300, 3 (March 2009), p. 22 Currently there is no economically feasible method for controlling invasive earthworms in forests.

Assassination and attempts An attempt to kill Bragin took place on March 19, 1994, at a settlement called Pisky (Bragin's hometown). Pisky, Yasynuvata Raion is a rural settlement of Yasynuvata Raion, just to the west from the Donetsk International Airport. A group of bandits from the Ryabin-Kushnir gang (run by Yevhen Kushnir and Anatoliy Ryabi) opened fire on Bragin's pigeon coop while Bragin was visiting his birds.The Irish Times - Battle of the oligarchs Miraculously Akhat Bragin survived the attempt. Akhat Bragin died in a bomb attack on Sunday, October 15, 1995, at the Shakhtar Stadium in Donetsk. After this event, the new president and chairman of Shaktar Donetsk became Rinat Akhmetov. The reason for Akhat's murder was his business dealings. Known in the criminal underworld as 'Alik the Greek', his organization got into conflicts with several others. The investigation into his death made little progress until the confession of a rival gangster, which led to the arrest and imprisonment of former policeman Vyacheslav Synenko.Kyiv Post - Akhat Bragin Legacy In honor of Akhat Bragin, the mosque of Donetsk is called Ahat Jami.

De Saint-Fond's romantic but inaccurate presentation of the discovery of Mosasaurus showing Hoffmann on the left. Johann Leonard Hoffmann (1710–1782) was a Maastricht army surgeon and amateur geologist who collected fossils from the local Mount Saint Peter. He is known for fossils named after him, and was one of the three people contacted on the discovery of the Mosasaurus in 1766, and especially the second one in the 1770s known as \\"le grand animal\\", that was later taken to Paris by Napoleon's army in 1794. History The first skull, found in 1764, purchased in 1784 by Camper's pupil Martin van Marum for the Teylers Museum, where it remains today. The second skull, M. hoffmannii holotype jaw fragments, known as the \\"great animal\\", it was taken as war booty to Paris, where it remains today in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle The first skull, engraving from the 1799 book by Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond The second skull, engraving from the 1799 book by Faujas de Saint-Fond In 1798 Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond published his first volume of a monumental natural history series, called Histoire naturelle de la montagne de Saint- Pierre de Maestricht, which also contained an account of the circumstances of the find. According to him Dr Hoffmann paid the quarrymen when they informed him of fossil finds. When the second skull was found in 1770, Hoffmann supposedly lead the excavation. Afterwards another local amateur geologist, the local canon priest Theodorus Joannes Godding (1722–1797), claimed his rights as landowner and forced Hoffmann to relinquish his ownership through a lawsuit, won by influencing the court. Whether or not this story was based on fact, De Saint-Fond saved the specimen for science, promising a considerable reward to Godding to compensate for his loss. However, of this famous story very little can be substantiated by archival evidence.Mosasaurus hoffmanni: De lotgevallen van een type-exemplaar, Peggy Rompen, 1995 Godding was the original owner, Hoffmann never possessed the fossil, and there was no lawsuit. Faujas de Saint-Fond probably never paid anything and the entire account seems to have been fabricated by him to liven up his book. The local army luitenant Jean Baptiste Drouin was also an avid collector of fossil specimens, and both Drouin and Hoffmann were in correspondence with the famous amateur geologist Petrus Camper about the finds. Camper postulated that the animal was a whale, or in any case a sea creature, rather than a land creature. Faujas de Saint- Fond insisted it was a crocodile, while Camper's son Adriaan claimed it was a monitor lizard and Georges Cuvier felt that it may be something as yet unknown, (the concept of extinction was new). Much later, Hermann Schlegel accused Hoffmann of falsifying his observations of the fossil.Hermann Schlegel's investigation of the Maastricht mosasaurs, Archives of Natural History. Volume 13, E. W.

He was awarded the IPEM Spiers’ Prize for 2003 for an extended one thousand-word abstract detailing the Barrett’s oesophagus research. =Current research= Current research on multi- slice/detector computed tomography (MDCT) is being undertaken in the Radiology Group of the University of Oxford. Work involves balancing image quality and radiation exposure for patients undergoing MDCT for medical purposes. Areas of particular interest include imaging the cervical spine, abdominal sepsis and low contrast features in the abdomen and liver. In collaboration with Health Protection Agency’s (HPA) Medical Dosimetry Group, he was responsible for the design of the third UK national CT dose survey and data collection. A final report on Doses from CT Examinations in the UK (2011 Review) was published by Public Health England in September 2014. Early results from the CT dose survey were presented at the UKRC conference in Manchester 2011 and later reported by AuntMinnieEurope. (AuntMinnie features the latest news and information about medical imaging.) The clinical expansion of CT and radiation dose are also discussed in Chapter 2 of the updated Springer book “Radiation Dose from Multidetector CT” (2nd edition; August 31, 2012 pp.21-32). Four scientific papers have been published and a scientific e-Poster paper on a diagnostic accuracy study was awarded the IPEM Poster Prize for best electronic poster exhibition at the UKRC Congress 2008. ( EC work was financially supported by the EC-EURATOM 6 Framework Programme (2002-2007) and formed part of the CT Safety & Efficacy (Safety and Efficacy of Computed Tomography (CT): A broad perspective) project, contract FP6/002388.) Work as an amateur horticulturalist Stuart Meeson also has a very keen interest in amateur horticulture. He is a member of many UK based horticultural societies and exhibits regularly at their horticultural shows. He was awarded the RHS Banksian Medal at the Dogmersfield, Winchfield and Crookham Village Horticultural Show 2010. In 2011 he was awarded the Ernie Self Novice Trophy at the Orchid Society of Great Britain (OSGB) Autumn Show. Later in 2014 he was awarded the RHS Banksian Medal at the OSGB Spring Show and a Certificate of Cultural Commendation for orchid Epipactis gigantea 'Trefor' by the RHS Orchid Committee in June 2015. At the 25th Anniversary Show he was awarded an RHS Gold medal and Best Flower Box at RHS Hampton Court Palace Flower Show 2015. In 2017 a Certificate of Cultural Commendation for orchid Masdevallia mendozae 'Mullus' was awarded by the RHS Orchid Committee in March 2017. At the inaugural RHS Chatsworth Flower Show (2017) he was awarded an RHS Silver Floral medal for a display of orchids in the Floral Marquee. In April 2018 Stuart was awarded Best Hybrid Orchid at the RHS London Orchid Show for Pleione Tongariro. The Guinness World Record for the most blooms on an orchid plant (sympodial) is 1,684 and was achieved by Stuart Meeson (UK), with his Epipactis gigantea 'Trefor', in Fleet, Hampshire, UK, as verified on 9 June 2018.

The only known species is Prolacerta broomi. The generic name Prolacerta is derived from Latin meaning “before lizard” and its species name broomi is in commemoration of the famous paleontologist Robert Broom, who discovered and studied many of the fossils found in rocks of the Karoo Supergroup. When first discovered, Prolacerta was considered to be ancestral to modern lizards, scientifically known as lacertilians. However, a study by Gow (1975) instead found that it shared more similarities with the lineage that would lead to archosaurs such as crocodilians and dinosaurs (including birds). Prolacerta is considered by modern paleontologists to be among the closest relatives of the Archosauriformes.  History of discovery Prolacerta was first described by Francis Rex Parrington in 1935 from a single skull recovered near the small town, Middelburg, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. The fossil was recovered from an exposure of rock from the Katberg Formation in the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone. At the time, Parrington described the first Prolacerta fossil, the early evolutionary relationships of archosaurs was even more poorly understood than they are currently. Due to its small size and lizard-like appearance, Parrington subsequently placed Prolacerta between basal younginids and modern lizards. Parrington's classification of Prolacerta was accepted for several decades, including by the paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp who conducted further research on Prolacerta. It was only after more Prolacerta fossils were found that more in depth research was undertaken on this animal. In the 1970s the close link between Prolacerta and crown archosaurs was first hypothesized, which lead to numerous phylogenetic analyses being conducted on Prolacerta and other stem archosaurs from the 1980s onwards.Groenewald, G.H. and Kitching, J.W., 1995. Biostratigraphy of the Lystrosaurus assemblage zone. In Biostratigraphy of the Beaufort Group (Karoo Supergroup) (Vol. 1, pp. 35-39). Pretoria: Council for Geosciences. Description Life restoration of Prolacerta broomi Prolacerta were small reptiles that lived during the Induan and Olenekian stages of the lower Triassic. Prolacerta is arguably the most well-represented stem- archosauriform, with numerous well preserved specimens housed in various research institutions in South Africa, Europe, and in the United States. With the skull of adult specimens ranging between 8 – 10 cm in length, Prolacerta were considered to have been small, lizard-like animals. However, several cranial and postcranial features set Prolacerta apart from lizards and instead show that it is an early relative of crown-archosaurs. Some of these notable features include elongated cervical vertebrae with elongate, thickened neural spines, which gave Prolacerta a slightly elongated neck and a wide range of flexibility. Cranial features include thecodont teeth, a feature observed in all ancestors of crown archosaurs, which were pointed and caniniform in shape. Prolacerta was probably a small, active, terrestrial carnivore or insectivore due to its fang-like teeth of roughly the same size and shape. Prolacerta is considered to have been a quadruped, although due to its hind limbs being larger and longer than its front limbs, there is a possibility that it was habitually bipedal during high activity. It has been hypothesized that Prolacerta was capable of cranial kinesis, although research into this possible feature of Prolacerta remains inconclusive. Classification Initially hypothesized to be ancestral to lizards, Prolacerta was later identified as an archosauromorph by Gow (1975). Gow placed it into a group known as the Prolacertiformes, which also contained \\"protorosaurs\\" such as Protorosaurus, Macrocnemus, and the long-necked tanystropheids. Macrocnemus and a few other \\"prolacertiforms\\" were allied with Prolacerta in the family Prolacertidae. However, later studies starting with Dilkes (1998) have split apart the concept of Prolacertiformes, with protorosaurs being placed near the base of Archosauromorpha and Prolacerta being much closer to Archosauriformes. Prolacertidae was also split by this reassessment, with Macrocnemus now considered a tanystropheid. Currently, Prolacertidae is restricted to Prolacerta and its close Australian cousin Kadimakara. Prolacertids are confidently considered to be archosauromorphs within the clade Crocopoda, along with the allokotosaurs, rhynchosaurs, and archosauriforms. The following cladogram is based on a large analysis of archosauriforms published by M.D. Ezcurra in 2016  References Category:Early Triassic archosauromorphs Category:Guadalupian first appearances Category:Extant Permian first appearances Category:Taxa named by Francis Rex Parrington ","title":"Prolacerta"},{"id":"35820506","text":"Kashuk-e Olya (, also Romanized as Kashūk-e ‘Olyā, Kashūk ‘Olyā, and Kashook Olya; also known as Keshūk-e Bālā, Kashūk Bālā, Kashūk-e Bālā, Keshūk Bālā, and Kishuk) is a village in Jolgeh-e Mazhan Rural District, Jolgeh-e Mazhan District, Khusf County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

He has actively participated in Mexican life as a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and since 1988 as the Rector of the Oaxaca State University System in the State of Oaxaca.  Early years  Modesto Seara Vazquez experienced the political persecution to which his father was subjected by the Franco regime, a situation which was surely decisive in defining his political vocation and position for international issues, because the surveillance of his home in the run-up to the Second World War left him marked with that passion forever. In 1950 he went to Madrid to prepare for his Aeronautical Engineering degree. Shortly afterwards he discovered his true vocation, which was the study of international issues, and he moved on to the law degree. He studied at the Faculty of Law of the Central University of Madrid (today Complutense University), being among the last generation to study at Calle de San Bernardo, before the faculty was transferred to the University City.  Education  * Doctorate in International Law. University of Paris «The Sobornne», 1959 *B.A. Central University, today Complutence University of Madrid, 1955 *Diploma in Sociology «Methods of Study of Social Attitudes», Jaime Balmes Institute of the CSIC, Spain, 1955 *Diploma of Higher International Studies, Spanish Association of International Colonial Studies, Madrid 1955 His doctoral thesis, entitled «Études de Droit Interplanetaire», provoked a lot of interest and Le Figaro Literaire dedicated a long report written by Beatrix Beck, Goncourt Literature Prize, to support the thesis. Radio Paris also broadcast a series of interviews with Modesto Seara Vazquez entitled «The Interplanetary Law Seen from Paris». As a result, he was invited to present a paper at the Congress of the International Astronautical Federation (London 1959) in which he enunciated his theory of the functional regulation of space, later published in Vienna (1960), and which would be assumed by the majority of jurists.  Academic Activities  * First travel to Mexico On 1st march, 1961 he began his collaboration with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, as a full-time research professor at the Institute of Comparative Law, now the Institute of Legal Research. At the same time he began to collaborate with the Faculty of Law and the School of Political and Social Sciences (now the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences) holding the chairs of Public International Law and International Organization. In 1961 he published his first book «Introduction to International Cosmic Law», a revised and updated edition of his doctoral thesis, that years later was translated into English. In 1963, part of the thesis was also published in Russian, in Moscow. In Paris, Modesto Seara Vazquez met a great figure of Mexican life, Isidro Fabela, who was introduced to him by the military advisor of the Mexican Embassy, General Alberto Salinas Carranza, one of the founders of Mexican aviation. Isidro Fabela was traveling to Europe with his wife Doña Josefina. The advanced age of both made them fear to travel alone so they decided to bring with them Modesto Seara Vazquez. Isidro Fabela's friendship was decisive in the life of Modesto Seara Vazquez, since it opened many doors and integrated him quickly into the life of the country. In that first decade of the 1960, Modesto Seara Vazquez had a very active academic life at National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he published a book on outer space law «Cosmic International Law» and a text on Public International Law, which would expand to 25 editions by 2016. All the editions of his books are subject to an update by him before he authorizes its publication. * Stay in the United States From 1965 to 1966 he was Professor at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, in an extremely enriching stay, where he lived with the essentially Mormon community of the State of Utah, one of the last theocracies in the Western world. In spite of his political ideas, different from those prevailing in that environment, he always had the respect of his hosts. While having different vacation periods, he got to know the whole western part of the United States and traveled frequently through the states of Utah, California, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. He also visited British Columbia, in Canada, where he stayed briefly in Vancouver. * The Struggle for Jewish Rights in the Soviet Union Modesto Seara Vazquez joined an international movement in favor of the Jews of the Soviet Union, as part of the Latin American Committee, defending «the right to leave». For more than two decades, he participated in many countries in different activities like lectures, seminars, conferences, etc. In October 1973, during the Yon Kippur war, he visited the USSR as part of a commission of four people that were sent to meet Jews who were denied an exit visa. That Commission visited Moscow, Kiev, Tbilisi and Leningrad. * One year in Europe In 1969 Modesto Seara Vazquez decided to spend his sabbatical year in Europe, half of it in Spain and the other part in Berlin (West) where he carried out research on Franco's foreign policy, using the bibliographic and periodical collections of the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut, in Berlin. During this period he also gave lectures in East Germany at the Karl Marx Universität, from Leipzig and Universität Rostock.  The journalistic dimension: press and television  In the 70's he combined his academic activities with an intense participation in the Press and the Media. In «El Sol de México» he wrote editorial comments and several special articles, also on sundays he wrote the Sunday supplement in «El Mundo desde el Sol» which was a weekly commentary about the international life with a little bit of humor. He was appointed general advisor of «Canal 13 TV (public television)» where he also wrote weekly comments about the international life in the «Séptimo día» program. A part from that he created a series of international reports named «Paz y Conflicto» which programs were The Impossible Peace (on the Middle East), April in Portugal (the carnation Revolution, in Lisbon, Portugal), They Will Not Kill Hope (about Chilean political life and the death of Salvador Allende), the New Empire (about the last years of the Iran of Shah Reza Pahleví), and so on. \\\\----  Oaxaca State Universities  * The theoretical phase In 1983, Modesto Seara Vazquez decided to abandon politics and return to university life, working at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. They were several years of an intense academic activity, both national and internacional where he increased his publications publishing new books and new editions, as well as essays. He runed the Mexican Yearbook of International Relations that he founded in 1980. In 1967 he created the Mexican Institute of Internacional Relations that years later was changed to The Mexican Association of International Studies. In 1989 he was elected Vice President of the International Studies Association (ISA). At the ISA-MAIE meeting held in Acapulco, Guerrero, he concluded his term as president of MAEI and he was elected Honorary President of the Association. In 1989 he was named National Researcher Emeritus, of the National System of Researchers of CONACYT. * The practical phase, making utopia a reality 1988 was a decisive year of Modesto Seara Vazquez's life. In that year the governor of the state of Oaxaca asked him to create a project to build a university in Huajuapan de León, in the mixtec region, in the north of the state. Modesto Seara Vazquez developed the project and it officially began a new model of universities, that are conceived as universities for development. The definition he gave to this model of university was in the sense of transcending its educational function, and understanding it as a cultural instrument to transform society. He gave it four main functions: teaching, research, dissemination of culture and promotion of development. The Technological University of the Mixteca opened doors in 1990, with 48 students, five professors and two classrooms, in the middle of a land baptized by local humorists as \\"the Seara Desert\\". It was the beginning of a great adventure that led to an unprecedented academic university project. In 2019, The Techonlogical University of the Mixteca has around 220 full-time research professors and about 1,800 students. It offers 12 bachelor and engineering degrees, 15 masters Degree programs, five PhD Degree programs, and it has nine research Institutes, within 109-hectare campus with more than 100 buildings. As a result, the students of the Technological University of the Mixteca routinely rank among the top nationally (according to CENEVAL's General Knowledge Exams), in the fields of computer engineering, electronics, industrial or business sciences. In 2008 and 2011, a group of students achieved first place in the world in HCI (Human Computar Interaction, ACM), in the finals that took place in Florence and Atlanta and they were also number two in the same competition (Human Computar Interaction, ACM), first time in San Jose, California in 2017 and the second time in Paris, in 2013. \\\\----  Academic Institutions  * President of the Mexican Association of International Studies, from 1967 to 1968 and from 1982 to 1993.

Since April 1971, it has been recognised as being a category A listed building.\\"Bank (Or Templand) Railway Viaduct over Lugar Water in Woodroad Park.\\" britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, Retrieved: 7 June 2018. The Woodroad Viaduct, which comprises 14 semi-circular arches, was designed by the civil engineer John Miller and built by the contractor James McNaughton. Construction was complicated by the presence of several coal workings in the vicinity, as well as the Lugar Water itself. It is largely composed of locally sourced white sandstone. The viaduct was completed during 1850, after which services of the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) commenced across it. It has been claimed that Miller considered the structure to be his finest work.“Lugar Water Viaduct.” ‘’engineering-timelines.com’’, Retrieved: 7 July 2018. Today, the viaduct is still in service and carries the Kilmarnock to Dumfries section of the main line from Glasgow to Carlisle. During the 21st century, national railway infrastructure company Network Rail formed a partnership with the Woodroad Regeneration Forum to preserve and maintain the Woodroad Viaduct for the long term; several future upgrades have been reportedly planned for the structure. History =Background and design= During the late 1840s, the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway company embarked on the construction of a southern extension of the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway to connect through to the border city of Carlisle. The selected route necessitated the construction of a crossing over the Lugar Water near the town of Cumnock; the task of designing this structure was assigned to the civil engineer John Miller, who had prior professional involvement in the company, in particular the surveying of the route.\\"Scottish fact of the day: Ballochmyle Viaduct.\\" scotsman.com, 10 November 2014. Millar decided upon the use of a relatively elegant ashlar masonry viaduct for this crossing. As built, the sandstone viaduct has a length of 229 meters and reaches a peak height of 49.2 meters at one point, though the average height of the structure is 28.8 meters. Efforts were made to keep both the deck and the approaches relatively level; the northern approach has a 1 in 200 gradient, while the southern approach has a less gentle gradient of 1 in 150. It has 14 semi-circular ashlar arches, nine of them having a span of 15.24 meters and the remainder possessing a 9.1 meter span, these smaller arches being placed at the ends of the structure. The thrust pressure line is close to the centre of each arch ring; the rings of the main arches have a thickness of 610mm (one twenty-fifth of the span), resulting in a calculated horizontal pressure present upon the arch's keystone of roughly 254 tonnes. In line with the practice of famed bridge-builder and civil engineer Thomas Telford, the viaduct features hollow piers and spandrels, which has the benefit of reducing the weight bearing on the structure's foundations. The piers located between the larger arches have a thickness of 2.1 meters at their tops, complete with a 610mm-wide central void; while the piers of the smaller arches have a thickness of 1.5 meters at the top along with a 300mm void. The smaller arches are deliberately separated from the main ones by 5 meter-thick abutments. The abutments present at either end of the whole structure, where the viaduct connects with the adjacent embankments, are possess a thickness of 7meters. =Construction= During its design process, the structure had to effectively account for several important local factors. In terms of its footing, the ground was less than ideal due to the presence of not only the Lugar Water but also of considerable mining activities. Specifically, as a result of the area having been rich in both limestone and coal, it had been worked for some time by various locals, commonly using a room and pillar technique . As these workings posed a clear threat to the stability of any major structure built around them, preliminary work was undertaken to locate these cavities, after which they would be cleared of loose debris and firmly packed using dry stone. This activity proved sufficient as the viaduct's piers have not suffered from settlement. Following the completion of this ground work, construction of the viaduct's piers commenced during 1848. This phase of work was assisted by the use of machinery in the form of derrick cranes, which were used to build both the piers and the abutments up to a maximum height of 7.6 meters above ground level. Above this height, construction activity was supported using an elevated service road, complete with travelling cranes that ran upon rails located upon either side of the viaduct. The viaduct was primarily construction of locally sourced white sandstone, which was transported to the site using a horse-drawn tramway. During this process, a high degree of attention was dedicated to the correct erection of the timber formwork that was used to construct the masonry arches, which had a height in excess of 30 meters. The weight of a single completed arch, which possessed a span of 15.24 meters, was estimated to have exceeded 1,000 tonnes, which exerting a pressure upon the structure's foundations of 68.4 tonnes per square meter. Overall, the viaduct contained 14,150 cubic meters of masonry, which weighed 34,040 tonnes. It was constructed at a reported cost of roughly £30,000, of which the centring alone cost around £4,500. The viaduct was completed during 1850. It has been claimed that Miller came to regard the Woodroad Viaduct as having been his greatest professional accomplishment. =Operational use= During 2010, the local Woodroad Regeneration Forum and national railway infrastructure company Network Rail embarked upon a joint effort aimed at safeguarding the Woodroad Viaduct and ensuring its long term future. In line with this effort, future work to both restore and upgrade the structure has been planned. On 25 September 2010, Cathy Jamieson, MP and MSP, unveiled a commemorative plaque to mark the passing of 160 years since the construction of the viaduct.

Covering approximately 5,000 sq ft of facade space and 10,000 sq ft of total painted surface, it is the tallest and largest indoor staircase mural. While deploying site specific collaborative art practice of allowing more than 1000 employees of the office building, to participate in the experience of painting in the initial phase, the artist conceptualised the creation as a public art project.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-13/people/28308156_1_paint- mural-employeeshttp://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/artandculture/Three- fold-story/Article1-490407.aspx Innovation of methodology The methodology of creation was the first-of-its-kind simultaneous use of four different art practices engaging in conceptual, site specific, collaborative, and performance art. Gupta allowed the 3500 employees at the site, the experience of putting their brush strokes, while on their job, in the initial half of the project. As a part of his performance art, he executed a series of roles while teaching and motivating employees. At the same time, the artist engaged the employees in his practice of team-building exercise through art while creating a five floor high artwork. In the second half of the project, the colours and strokes were taken as raw stock for creating the composition. He proceeded with the three-month performance art alone; live in front of 3500 employees and almost as many visitors at the site (the campus) to evolve a storyline. Keeping in mind the visibility of the staircase all over the campus through a 60 ft high glass facade, the site specific intervention amalgamated the background wall and the front face of the staircase perspectives of five floors into a single canvas merging surrounding sides and roof within one composition. Performance art marathon The other notable feature of the invention was a marathon performance by the artist working non stop on his creation for three months except for few hours of rest and sleep at night. Concept  When commissioned by Bharti Airtel Ltd to create a “staircase artwork” at their headquarters, the artist brought forth his idea born out of a decade and a half practice of public art projects to a radical reorientation towards introducing a unique sustainable development process in corporate entity, thus establishing that the art can contribute to the business environment as well, by refreshing the intangible quality of its soft power among employees.  The evolving storyline A philosophical perspective was highlighted in the artist's statement while addressing the translation of his sustainable development ideology in his site specific intervention.

(2011). \\"Investigational New Drug (IND) Application.\\" Retrieved April 12, 2012, from https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/investigationalnewdrugindapplication/default.htm. Testing for new drugs must successfully go through three phases of research before a drug can be marketed to the public. In Phase I trials, the drug's safety is tested on a small group of participants. The drug's effectiveness is tested during Phase II trials with a larger number of participants. Phase III trials, involving 1,000- 3,000 participants, analyze effectiveness, determine side effects and compare the outcomes of the new drug to similar drugs on the market.ClinicalTrials.gov. (2007). \\"Understanding Clinical Trials.\\" Retrieved April 12, 2012, from http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand An additional phase, Phase IV, is included to continually gain information after a drug is on the market. Geron's IND application for the GRNOPC1 clinical trial, nearly 28,000 pages in length, was one of the most extensive applications ever to be submitted to the FDA. Pre-clinical data Before Geron could test GRNOPC1 in humans, tests in animals had to occur. At the University of California at Irvine, Dr. Hans Keirstead and Dr. Gabriel Nistor, credited with the technique used to develop oligodendrocytes from human embryonic stem cells, injected the cells into rats with spinal cord injuries. The condition of the rats improved after treatment.Keirstead, H., Nistor, G., Bernal, G., Totoiu, M., Cloutier, F., Sharp, K., Steward, O. (2005). \\"Human Embryonic Stem Cell Derived Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Transplants Remyelinate and Restore Locomotion after Spinal Cord Injury.\\" The Journal of Neuroscience, 25(19). Geron Spinal Cord Injury Trial The first patient, identified in an article by the Washington Post as Timothy J. Atchison of Alabama, enrolled in the trial in October 2010. The patient was treated at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, GA just two weeks after he sustained a spinal cord injury in a car accident. The Shepherd Center and six other spinal centers were recruited by Geron to participate in the clinical trial. The Washington Post reported that Atchison \\"has begun to get some very slight sensation: He can feel relief when he lifts a bowling ball off his lap and discern discomfort when he pulls on hairs on some parts of his legs. He has also strengthened his abdomen.\\" Atchison underwent therapy at the Shepherd Center for three months before returning home to Alabama.Stein, R. (2011). \\"Stem Cells were God's Will, says First Recipient of Treatment.\\" Washington Post, April 15. Although Geron initially aimed to enroll ten patients in the trial, only three additional patients were added after Atchison. As specified by Geron, eligible patients had to experience a neurologically complete spinal cord injury within seven to fourteen days prior to enrollment. In addition, patients had to be between the ages of 18 and 65 and could not have a history of malignancy, significant organ damage, be pregnant or nursing, unable to communicate or participate in any other experimental procedures. Participants received one injection of GRNOPC1 containing approximately 2 million cells. Even though the trial has officially ended, Geron will continue to monitor participants for fifteen years.ClinicalTrials.gov. (2012). \\"Safety Study of GRNOPC1 in Spinal Cord Injury.\\" Retrieved April 12, 2012, from http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01217008 Although no official results from the trial have been published, preliminary results from the clinical trial were presented at the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) conference in October 2011. None of the participants experienced serious adverse events, although nausea and low magnesium were reported. In addition, no changes to the spinal cord or neurological condition were found.Geron. (2011). \\"GRNOPC1.\\" Retrieved April 12, 2012, from After investing millions of dollars in the research leading up to this trial, Geron Corporation discontinued the study in November 2011 to focus on cancer research. John Scarlett, Geron's chief executive officer, said \\"In the current environment of capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions, we intend to focus our resources on advancing our two novel and promising oncology drug candidates.\\"Stein, R. (2011). \\"First Human Embryonic Stem Cell Therapy in People Discontinued.\\" Washington Post, November 14. The company's stocks fell dramatically to $1.50 per share from $2.28 per share when news of the trial's discontinuation became public. A spokesperson for the company said that Geron would save money by ending the trial despite the loss in investors. Because many believed Geron's trial offered hope for advancing knowledge related to stem cells and their potential uses, there was disappointment in the scientific community when the trial was cut short. An article on Bioethics Forum, a publication produced by The Hastings Center, stated, \\"It is one thing to close a trial to further enrollment for scientific reasons, such as a problem with trial design, or for ethical reasons, such as an unanticipated serious risk of harm to participants. It is quite another matter to close a trial for business reasons, such as to improve profit margins.\\"Baylis, F. (2011). \\"Geron's Discontinued Stem Cell Trial: What About the Research Participants?\\" Bioethics Forum, December 2. In 2013 Geron's stem cell assets were acquired by biotechnology firm BioTime, led by CEO Michael D. West, the founder of Geron and former Chief Scientific Officer of Advanced Cell Technology. BioTime indicated that it plans to restart the embryonic stem cell-based clinical trial for spinal cord injury.

History During the 12th century, the area around Münchenbuchsee was part of the lands of the Baron of Buhse. In 1180, Cuno of Buhse or Buchsee granted all of his lands to the Order of St. John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller. This land grant included the villages of Münchenbuchsee, Wankdorf and Worblaufen as well as vineyards on Lake Biel. In 1192, the Pope confirmed this gift on the knights. Shortly thereafter it was converted into a commandery under the Order. The neighboring nobility and the citizens of Bern granted the commandery additional lands. This included the church at Twann (1252), Moosseedorf (1256), Krauchthal (1273), Bremgarten (1306), Wohlen (1320), the castle, court and village of Moosseedorf (1256-57) and the district of Bremgarten (1306). The commandery had its own seal by 1264. Bern granted the commandery limited rights of citizenship in 1329 . Originally the commandery was surrounded by a wall, though this was eventually demolished. The south side of the complex contained the courtyard of the oldest part of Cuno's castle, the monastery (housing for the knights), the commander's house and a church. The church's choir was built in 1260-80 and the stained glass is from the 13th century. The current church tower was built in 1891. On the north side of the complex there was a summer house, a guesthouse and workshops. The monastic community was always quite small. In 1480, only the commander, the prior and six knights lived there. In keeping with the Rule of Life of the Order, the knights at the commandery were responsible for providing pastoral care to the people of the area, operating a pilgrims' hospital and caring for the poor. The commander of Münchenbuchsee often was also appointed the head of the Thunstetten Commandery. At the start of the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland in 1528, Commander Peter Englisberg, who headed both houses, supported the secularization of the two commanderies, for which he received Bremgarten Castle as a reward. The commander's house became a rectory, the monastery and outbuildings became a granary and the remaining buildings were used to administer the bailiwick of Münchenbuchsee. On the north side a bailiff's castle and tithe barn were built in 1600-20, on the site of a medieval building.

Founded in the 1770s and operated as a farm until 1975, it is one of the few surviving intact 19th-century farm properties in the community. Its land, over in size, is now town-owned conservation and farmland. The property has trails open to the public, and an annual celebration of Lamson Farm Day is held here every September.http://www.montvernonnh.us/index.php/lamson-farm- home The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Description and history Lamson Farm is located about north of the town center of Mont Vernon. Its built infrastructure is located on and around open fields at the junction of Lamson and Cross Roads, northwest of New Hampshire Route 13. The property consists of about , extending in a roughly rectangular shape north to the town line with New Boston. The northernmost sections of the property are wooded and hilly, with a spur of Lamson Road (now part of the trail network) extending north toward the top of McCollom Hill, at the high point of the property. The hill was historically the site of a blueberry patch and apple orchard, features that are giving way to forest. The built infrastructure of the farm consists of eleven buildings, located along either side of Lamson Road. The main house is on the east side, consisting of a multi-section structure whose core is a Cape style 1-1/2 story timber frame house built about 1770. Most of the outbuildings date to the early 20th century; the main cow barn, made by combining two older structures, has at least one section dating to the early 19th century. Located northeast of the farmstead are the foundational remains of a second farm property, which was purchased by the Lamsons in the early 20th century. Located near the junction of Lamson and Cross Streets is a stone foundation which once held a small district schoolhouse. The property was first developed by William Lamson, a native of Ipswich, Massachusetts. The farm was worked continuously by members of the Lamson family until 1975, and was at mid-20th century the largest dairy farming operation in the town. The town acquired the property in 1975 in order to preserve it as a vital reminder of its agricultural history.

Life  Gobel was born in Frankfurt am Main around 1498. The son of Niklas Gobel, a metal potter () and journeyman's master () from Dinkelsbühl. During the 16th century, the arts and trades blossomed in Frankfurt and in 1528 Konrad Gobel became the leader of the journeyman's association of the town.  Work  Gobel's workshop produced several unique bells for churches in the cities and towns around Frankfurt. These include two bells made in 1545 and 1546 for St. Stephen's Church in Mainz and the central bell made in 1557 for the parish church of St. Laurentius zu Ebersheim in Rheinhessen. His bells are distinguished by the attachment of medallions, ancient coins, and poured metal casts of cut stones. In 1545 Gobel created a small bronze plaque for the coffin of Prince-Elector Albrecht of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz. This plaque is today on display at the Museum of Decorative Arts, Berlin. He also created the magnificent chandeliers for the West Choir of the Mainz Cathedral, which today no longer exists.

Musically, \\"Dressin' Up\\" incorporates the styles of electro and dance-rock, along with a prominent electronic dance production. Lyrically, the song speaks of dressing up in different outfits for a lover, and contains multiple innuendos. \\"Dressin' Up\\" garnered mixed reviews from critics, some of whom complimented its \\"fun\\" sound, while others denounced it as being too similar to Perry's other songs. Upon the release of Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, the song charted on the UK Singles Chart at number 109. Background Perry worked with frequent collaborator Tricky Stewart on the song. In October 2011, Tricky Stewart told MTV that he was back in the studio with Perry working on leftovers from their Teenage Dream sessions. He stated: \\"Katy and I went into [the studio] just to address some issues with [the] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on [the album], so we are in the process of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on\\", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: \\"We always knew that the records we created were special [and] at the time it was more contractual obligation [that they did not make the album], I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless.\\" The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled \\"Dressing Up\\", saying: \\"This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good\\". Recording Matt Thiessen (pictured), of Relient K helped co-write \\"Dressin' Up\\". \\"Dressin' Up\\" was written by Perry, along with Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, Monte Neuble, and Matt Theissen.

The total alluvial area of the delta is estimated at around , while today the delta takes up roughly . A total of of the delta are designated protected areas: * ornithological reserves: Prud, Orepak, Podgredom * ornithological and ichthyological reserve at the river mouth * protected landscape: lake Modro oko An additional 1200 ha of nature in the delta is not protected. In 2003, the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning organized a public discussion about the proposal to make the delta a nature park. In 2007, the experts from the State Institute for Nature Protection made another formal proposal for the Neretva Delta to become a nature park. A public discussion process was started but quickly terminated by the Ministry of Culture, allegedly because of protests from the local government.

Fleisher Art Memorial, also known as Church of the Evangelists and St. Martin's College for Indigent Boys, is a set of four buildings with a history that unites idealism or religious beliefs, service to the poor, and art. Formerly an Episcopal church in the working-class Bella Vista neighborhood of South Philadelphia, it is best known as the home of the Graphic Sketch Club founded by Samuel S. Fleisher, which offers free art lessons to children and adults. The four buildings include a campanile built in 1857, a basilica built 1884-1886, St. Martin's College built in 1906, and two rowhouses built in the 1850s. Since Fleisher's death in 1944, his trust, which owns the buildings, has been administered by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Art Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and is located at 711-721 Catharine St. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Church of the Evangelists Pulpit in the church The Church of the Evangelists was established as a mission church for the poor of Catherine Street in 1837, by Episcopalians named William Welsh and Horace Binney, among others. A church building was constructed in 1857 which includes the campanile which still stands. The church's viability became a concern by 1880, possibly because of the influx of non-Episcopal immigrants to the neighborhood. Henry Robert Percival, a well-known high church Episcopal priest, revived the fortunes of the Church of the Evangelists when he was appointed rector about 1880. Note: This includes Henry Robert Percival Unfinished exterior decoration The well-connected Percival had traveled in Italy and had \\"a sensibility which combined Italian and Anglo-Catholic romanticisms.\\" He wished to rebuild the church based on the Romanesque models of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, the Cathedral of Pisa and the Orvieto Cathedral. The 1884 design by the firm Furness and Evans was in actuality based on San Zeno Maggiore in Verona. Frescos in the church were painted by Robert Henri, Nicola D'Ascenzo, and by local parishioners. Much of the interior decorative work was left unfinished. The influences on the architecture include \\"Italy, Ruskin, the ecclesiological movement, and the pageantry of medieval Christianity.\\" James van Trump is more critical, stating that \\"a rather self-conscious coterie of late nineteenth century Philadelphia haute bourgeoisie, 'engaged', one might say in being 'Catholic', cultivated, and artistic.\\" While the church's original Wurlitzer pipe organ has fallen into disrepair, it remains in the sanctuary and is the last such factory-installed organ in Philadelphia in 2018. After Percival retired on account of illness in the 1890s, the church's fortunes declined. St. Martin's College for Indigent Boys was built in 1906, perhaps in an effort to fight the decline and better connect with the non-Episcopalian neighborhood. Art school Samuel S Fleisher Art Memorial Historical Marker Samuel Stewart Fleisher, the son of German Jewish immigrants, became vice- president of the family business after graduating from the Wharton School of Business. By that time the family business, the Fleisher Yarn Company, was a major manufacturer of hand-knitting yarns and worsted fabric. Fleisher was extraordinarily concerned for the welfare of the company's workers, their children, and others who lived in the neighborhood. Fleisher started offering free art classes to children in 1898 in the Jewish Union building at 422 Bainbridge Street. Later known as the Graphic Sketch Club, the institution gave free, non-competitive, collaborative classes to both children and adults without discrimination by race or nationality. In 1906 it moved to a larger building at 740 Catharine Street, then in 1916 it moved across the street to Saint Martin's College for Indigent Boys. The church was purchased and converted into an art gallery in 1922.History of Fleisher , accessed May 14, 2012. In 1944, Fleisher died and left his estate in trust to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to continue the Graphic Sketch Club, which was renamed the Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial. In 1983 it became a formally independent non- profit corporation with a separate board of trustees, but it is still managed by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Fleisher Art Memorial Today The former sanctuary is decorated for the annual Día de los Muertos Altar Celebration and serving as the local wards' polling station. The Fleisher Memorial continues to offer free and low-cost classes and workshops to both children and adults, in subjects such as drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, photography, and dance.Free Hand, Fleisher Art Memorial, accessed May 15, 2012. Since 1997 they have also offered the \\"Community Partnership in the Arts\\" program which places artists in public school classrooms in South Philadelphia. Artists teach students for 90-minute classes twice a week for 6–10 weeks.Community Partnerships, Fleisher Art Memorial, accessed May 15, 2012. Ceramist Winnie Owens-Hart is among the artists who have worked at the Memorial. The gallery contains art by Violet Oakley, tiles by Henry Chapman Mercer, 18th-century Portuguese art, and primitive European art, as well as the religious art from the original church. There are six early stained glass windows made by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, and one later window, designed by John LaFarge. Entrance to the gallery is free, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with reduced hours on Saturdays.Hours and Directions , Fleisher Art Memorial, accessed May 15, 2012.

Everything they used had a spiritual aspect to it, including cosmetics. Both men and women wore makeup. Traders traded makeup often, especially in the upper classes. In tombs, cosmetic palettes were found buried in gold with the deceased as grave goods, which further emphasized the idea that cosmetics were not only used for aesthetic purposes but rather magical and religious purposes. Chemistry The two main forms of eye makeup were grepond eye paint and black kohl. The green eye paint was made of malachite, a copper carbonate pigment, and the black kohl was made from galena, a dark grey ore. Crushed charcoal was also used in this process. Mesdemet or kohl was used for lining the eyes and were revealed to bring along potent health benefits in the form of protection from disease, bugs and sun rays.  Medical uses  The ancient Egyptians created a remedy for burns by mixing the cheek and lip stain with red natron, northern salt, and honey. However, they strongly believed that the healing effects of these cosmetics were magical rather than medical. Surprisingly, there were actually benefits. One of the most important benefits is that the makeup contained lead salts, which, when contacting the skin, caused the body to produce more nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is known to fight off disease causing bacteria. Therefore, the Egyptians were less likely to get diseases or infections.  Cosmetic palettes and jars  Cosmetic palettes were used to grind makeup. The earliest examples were rectangular in shape and date back to 5000 BC. The palettes later adopted a rounder shape like the Narmer Palette. King Narmer's palette was the earliest piece of its kind. It has decorations of the King smiting the enemies of Egypt and the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, as well as a cavity for the grinding of cosmetics, making it a double purposed palette. These later developed into fish shaped palettes. They might have chosen the fish shape as the fish was a symbol of resurrection and new life. The fish shaped palettes were usually adorned with precious stones for royalty. These palettes have developed into baboon shaped containers to hold the kohl which held symbolic meanings for the ancient Egyptians.Ancient Egypt: the mythology  Use in different social classes  The use of cosmetics in ancient Egypt varied slightly between social classes, where more make-up was worn by higher class individuals as wealthier individuals could afford more cosmetics. Although there was no prominent difference between the make-up styles of the upper and lower class, noble women were known to pale their skin using creams and powders. This was due to pale skin being a sign of nobility (especially in the Late and Graeco-Roman Periods of Egypt) as lighter skin meant less exposure to the sun whereas dark skin was associated with the lower class who tanned while taking part in menial labor such as working in the fields. Thus, paler skin represented the non-working noble class, as noble women would not work in the sun.

He is the founder of the social network for musicians, Speedgig. He is also a former band drummer of Racer X, which is an American heavy metal band based out of Los Angeles, and former drummer of Austrian rock bands No Bros and Speedy Weekend Band. Early life Gschoesser was born in Tirol, Austria. He started playing the drums at the late age of 17. He first attracted the attention of the Austrian band, Scream, with Andy Woerz, who later became an Austrian actor and singer. In 1981, Gschoesser started drumming for the Speedy Weekend Band, which became the most popular heavy metal band in Austria at that time. Playing all over Austria, they also opened for Eric Burdon, Roger Chapman, and others during their Austrian tour. History with No Bros After the Speedy Weekend Band broke up, Gschoesser was picked up by No Bros in 1983, an Austrian rock band. Managed by Gotthard Rieger, the band started recording later that year and released the album Our Own Way. In subsequent years, No Bros went on European tours with other bands such as Saxon, Samson, Girlschool, and Ginger Baker and Band, who was the former drummer of Cream. Racer X In 1985, Gschoesser moved to Los Angeles and enrolled at the Musicians Institute, where he met fellow students and future Racer X bandmates Paul Gilbert and Juan Alderete. Later that year, Paul Gilbert, who later helped form the popular band Mr. Big, asked Gschoesser to be his drummer for Racer X. Soon after, Juan Alderete, came on as the bass player and later Jeff Martin as their singer. Gilbert entered in a Guitar competition, Guitar Wars, with Gschoesser and Alderete at Gazzarries on the Sunset Strip. Racer X won the competition. The band started their recording process at Sun Parrier studio near San Francisco in 1985. Since Gschoesser was only on a student visa, he was not allowed to record. The band received legal permission for Gschoesser to work for 24 hours. This allowed Gschoesser to record his drum sequence, while the rest of the band finished up the record in two weeks. After, Racer X released its debut album Street Lethal on January 1, 1986 on Mike Varney's Shrapnel Records label. Gschoesser left the band. Guitarist Bart Walsh, former member of David Lee Roth Band, connected Gschoesser with the American band Icebreaker. Gschoesser replaced the drummer, Eric Singer. The band performed at Los Angeles nightclubs The Roxy and Whisky A Go Go. After three years in Los Angeles, Gschoesser returned to Austria when his visa expired. Speedgig Back in Austria in 2011, Gschoesser started Speedgig, a social network that allows musicians from all over the world to connect with each other and gain access to the music industry. Personal life Gschoesser resides in Austria with his wife and two children.

They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe, in accordance with The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976 Indian Constitution.http://tribal.nic.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/7%20-%20Act%201976%20No%20108%201976.pdf History The history of their origin is shrouded in mysteries and so is the term \\"Kharam\\". They don't have any written documents to support their history of origin other than to rely on their folk songs, folktales and story which is passed on to generation after generation. The word Kharam is believed to have derived from the words khwa ram which is translated as \\"That land\\". According to another definition, the word Kharam is a compound word of kha (south) and ram (land or place) which literally means ‘Southland’. The speakers of Kharam are mainly found in Kangpokpi district of Manipur and their language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family of the language. The Kharam dialect is mainly spoken in Tuisenphai, Laikot Kharam, Laikot Phaijol, Tampak Kharam, New Keithel Manbi and Kharam Khullen villages in the Kangpokpi district of Manipur. Kharam has close affinities with other languages such as Kom, Purum, Aimol etc. The Kharams today are inhabited in the seven villages of Manipur of which the Kharam Pallen village is the oldest and largest village of Kharam tribe. Kangpokpi District. Singh, K. S., ed. \\"India's Communities A-Z\\", Oxford University Press, USA 1999 Society The Kharam society is very complex, it is headed by a chief who is elected democratically and it is not hereditary, he will be supervised by the village councils who are collectively known as Kataar (Old people). The chief has to make sure that he adhere to various rules and regulation sets by the whole people, and he must be very strict in his food habit as well, or else it easily resulted in his termination of the term. There is no definite period for his term but in the later period especially after the conversion of most of its people to Christians they agree to set it 5 years of terms, and during the transition at one point of time the non Christian when they were in majority become the chief and one person among the Christian (Protestant) is to be the Village Secretary, but with passes of time the number of non Christian decline and today both of the post (chairman and secretary is elected) and So today it is simply called as Chairman. The whole village was divided into two major groups Lomtang Shakteng and Lomtang Thangteng, and it is they who maintain the village gate clean, safe and secure. but during emergency they took the help of other group like kalen nai etc. The Kharam have dormitory system and it is mainly based on Clan wise where eligible/marriageable male would go sleep in the house of the family from another clan who have marriageable age group, but is not mandatory that they must necessarily marry from the house where they go sleep, but if the girl where they sleep got married off, then they automatically have to change to other house. But today these system is no longer practised. Lapu group and Lapi Group (male and female song's leader) who are in charge of preserving the songs, dance and other cultural practices within the whole society plays an important role, and it is they maintain discipline within the upcoming younger generation, but today some member regrets that the discipline which was once very strict is no longer to be observed because there is no strict law enforcer. Religion Today, most of the Kharams are already converted into Christians except 2-3 household still practising the old customary practices.  Clans  It has various clans namely: 1.Shaichal 2. Rangla ( Khouchung and khounoi) 3.Mariem. 4. Saiphu 5. Seilon 6. Makan 7. Rakhou. 8. Keilaam. 9. Jaiche. 10. Inthiet.11. Neisaam. 12 Thanjol. But as of today keilam, inthiet, Neisaam, Makan, have extinct. among the causes for the decline in their population various reasons is cited but among them 1. Plague and malaria 2. Kuki Rebellion 3. conflict with Chothe Tribe are the main contributors. The notion of clan is a contested and contrasted views among the Kharams as for example the case of Rangla: it is divided into two lineage system Rangla Khouchung and Rangla Khounoi, but both the sub clans making a different claims and are the two sub clans even related is also a matter of disputes.

They were also used for Coastal defense and fortification. They largely exceeded the heaviest guns fielded by the Army, which were 24-pounder long guns. The nominal weight of shot was 36 French livres, .  Usage  Installed on the lower deck of the larger warships, the 36-pounder long gun was the largest caliber used in the Navy of the Age of the Sail. Attempts to use 48-pounders were made, for instance on Royal Louis, but these proved impractical to use on ships, partly because their weight allowed for only a few pieces, and because the heavy balls were unwieldy to load by hand. However, some coastal batteries fielded 48-pounders and even 64-pounders. In the Royal Navy, a similar role was fulfilled by 32-pounder long guns.  History  French warships began to carry 36-pounders under Louis XIV, with the reform of the Navy undertaken by Richelieu. At this time, only first rank warships could carry them. In 1676, the entire Navy fielded merely 64 such heavy pieces, all bronze. From 1690, in only two years, their number increased from 115 to 442 (of which 407 were made of bronze), as the number and size of first-rank ships increased. Many 12-pounders were melted to procure the bronze needed to produce the needed 36-pounders. A maximum was reached in 1702 with 860 guns (411 bronze and 449 iron). Under Louis XV, their number was significantly reduced (164 in 1718, 452 in 1741), but from the mid-18th century, a sustained rearmament effort increased the number of 36-pounders to 986 in 1756, 1046 in 1777 and 2484 in 1786. These guns were all made of iron. They armed the lower battery of the largest warships: a 74-gun ship of the line would carry 28; an 80-gun, 30; and both 110-gun and 120-gun, 32. After the Napoleonic Wars, the 36-pounder long gun remained in use on older warships, though it was largely superseded by the 30-pounder long gun on newer units. The 36-pounders of the 1820s were fitted with flintlock primers, and those produced in this era featured a characteristic ring on the pommel.  Operation  A 36-pounder required a 14-man crew, comprising one chief gunner, 12 gunners, and one powder-boy. To load the piece, the first left-hand gunner would introduce a cartridge into the barrel; the first right-hand gunner would ram it to the bottom of the barrel; the first left-hand gunner would introduce the shot and a cloth wad, which would be rammed by the right- hand gunner. Then the crew would bring the gun to bear by pulling ropes. The chief gunner would then pin the cartridge through the touch hole and pour priming powder. naval gun. The chief gunner would then point the gun with the help of the third and fourth gunners on each side, and the last gunner on the left would then fire the gun by touching the touch hole with a linstock. Flintlock firing was not standardized in the French navy before the end of the First Empire. The first right-hand gunner would then ram thrice to remove residues from the bore of the gun.

It was published in Cambridge, Massachusetts by H. O. Houghton and Company. Plot summary The story begins in South Bradfield, Massachusetts, with the main character, Lydia Blood, accompanied by her Aunt Maria and her grandfather Deacon Latham on their family farm. Both of Lydia's parents had died of illness when Lydia was young and she is now, at the age of nineteen, being sent to live with her other aunt, on her father's side of the family, Aunt Josephine, in Venice, Italy. Lydia was not only blessed with good looks and good smarts, but she also was blessed with a beautiful singing voice which she is going to cultivate in Venice and attempt to make a career out of. Her Aunt Josephine wrote to her grandfather suggesting that Lydia should come to Venice to live with her. She also suggested that he should go to Boston to find a ship to bring Lydia to Europe, which is how he found Captain Jenness and the Aroostook. Lydia and her grandfather travel to Boston where the Aroostook, a large and beautiful ship, awaits to take Lydia and several other passengers to Trieste. While looking for the wharf that the Aroostook is anchored at, Lydia and her grandfather become lost and decide to rest for a minute. During their rest they encounter two men who ask if Lydia is all right because she looks very pale and distraught. Her grandfather ensures the men that she is just tired from traveling and they leave. Lydia is angered that they would ask this question because she felt that they did not have the right to ask such a question. Finally the captain of the Aroostook, Captain Jenness, finds Lydia and her grandfather and shows them to the ship. Captain Jenness is a warm and confident man and he assures Lydia that she will be right at home on the Aroostook being that he has two daughters of his own who travel with him quite a lot. Lydia leaves her grandfather and boards the ship. Her room is the stateroom on the ship, the largest and most elegant room that Captain Jenness had designed for his wife. Lydia then meets a young boy named Thomas who brings Lydia's things to her room. Thomas is the steward on the Aroostook and he tells Lydia that Captain Jenness and his crew are first rate. He is very excited and amused by Lydia and her possessions, especially her beautiful black silk dress. Lydia tells Thomas that her Aunt Maria makes all of Lydia's dresses and that she has a real gift for it. Lydia then tells Thomas that she was a teacher in South Bradfield, which Thomas finds wildly interesting because of Lydia's young age. Thomas shows Lydia around the Aroostook and then to the kitchen. Lydia is in dismay when she sees that the cook, named Gabriel, is not a woman because this means that Lydia will be on the only woman on board the ship. Deacon Latham returns to Aunt Maria in South Bradfield and tells her that everything went well and that Lydia is safely aboard the Aroostook. He then tells Maria that she will be the only woman on the ship. Maria drops the food that she had in her hand in horror. She is worried that Lydia will have no one to talk to and relate to during the journey. Passing outside is Minister Goodlow and Maria calls him in to tell him of Lydia being the only woman aboard the ship. Both Minister Goodlow and Deacon Latham successfully reassure Maria that Lydia will be fine on her journey. Lydia is introduced to the first officer Mr. Watterson and then sees the other passengers who will be traveling with her. She immediately recognizes two of them to be the two men who had asked if she was all right previously on the docks in Boston. The two men are Mr. James Staniford and Mr. Charles Dunham. The third man Lydia does not recognize; his name is Mr. Hicks. Staniford and Dunham are both well to do men from New England who are in their late twenties. Mr. Hicks is also a young man but he does not look well when Lydia sees him. Captain Jenness explains that Hicks is a drunk and he is aboard the ship trying to straighten himself up. Dunham and Staniford, once in their room, show some disgust that Lydia is such a young girl yet she is being treated so well already. They also look down on Hicks and treat him as if he is of a lower class. Staniford and Dunham are very interested in knowing more about Lydia and they want to make sure that she feels comfortable on the ship after finding out that she will be the only woman on board, they even comment on her unmistakable beauty to each other. However, they do not think too highly of Lydia because of where she is from in Massachusetts. Staniford is traveling to Europe because of his “irresolute mood” and he believes that “Europe is the place for American irresolution.” Staniford wants to move to California or Colorado when he returns. He has a great deal of money but due to a bad business venture has lost much of it. He has many talents, but he wants to turn to the land and operate a farm in the West. Dunham is traveling to Europe to see a somewhat long lost love of his, Miss. Hibbard. Dunham had proposed to Miss Hibbard but she had declined and left for Europe. A few weeks later she wrote to Dunham asking for him to take her back and marry. Both Staniford and Dunham are still in wonder as to why Lydia is on the ship. They think that Lydia lives in a boring town where nothing exciting ever happens, so what could have possibly occurred to force her to travel to Europe at such a young age? After having some conversation with Lydia they are both confused and amused as to how Lydia is so proper and intelligent. Staniford is a snobbish man and he is very curious to hear what Lydia is like. He looks down on her in amusement and he urges Dunham to interact with Lydia so he can study her. Staniford thinks that Lydia has never interacted with a man before and that Dunham's arm was the first that she had ever held. He believes that her style is of her own creation and that it is by luck that she is able to create it on her own. Dunham has the ship's carpenter make an area for shuffleboard so that he and Lydia can play. Hicks decides to join in as well while Staniford sits on the side and observes. Staniford feels pity for Lydia when she treats Hicks like a gentleman; she really is truly innocent and inexperienced. Staniford feels the need to study and classify all of the people that he meets. Lydia is still unclassified to him so she fascinates him. He believes that she is book smart but lacks common sense because of her sheltered life in South Bradfield. After a week Staniford finally decides to talk to Lydia one on one. He is somewhat patronizing and he asks Lydia leading questions, which make her feel like a lesser person. Lydia tells him her life story and soon Staniford, who always had a way with women, finds himself to be flirting with her. Staniford feels that he must protect Lydia's “helpless loneliness.” On Sunday Staniford, not a very religious man, pokes fun that the crew are going to be eating a late breakfast because they are attended a church service that Dunham is performing. At the end of the service the group sings and upon hearing Lydia's beautiful voice the crew is stunned. Staniford, of course, is also fascinated by Lydia's voice and begins to think that is the reason as to why she is traveling to Europe. Dunham tells Lydia that he is going to organize a sort of a musical where Lydia can sing. After the service Staniford makes more off color remarks about religion that offend the crew and Dunham in particular. An argument later ensues at dinner about religion and Staniford purposely goes after Dunham. Dinner ends short with the crew very upset with Staniford. Later that evening Staniford and Lydia walk together on the deck. Lydia tells him that she has not encountered many men in her father and Staniford finds it amusing that she is being subordinate to him even though she is an authority figure herself as a school teacher. Lydia tells Staniford that she thinks that he is making fun of everyone and that he feels as if he is better than them. Staniford angrily demands to know why and Lydia, realizing that she now has the upper hand, says that she might tell him in Venice. Staniford retorts and says that they will not meet in Venice because he knows that an older man of his place in society cannot be seen with a younger woman like Lydia. Instead of directly telling this to Lydia he simply says that they will both be too busy and will not have an opportunity to meet up again. The two speak of Lydia's voice and what she wants to do when she arrives in Venice. Staniford is still flirting with the Lydia by the end of their walk and he takes her hand and begins to bring it to his lips. Lydia helplessly allows him to do so, but he stops abruptly and says goodnight. Staniford thinks to himself how he almost came to kiss her hand and then he thinks that Hicks, in this matter, is a better man for not have making any advances towards Lydia. The next morning Staniford is anxious to see Lydia and to read her body language. However, Lydia does not come to breakfast on account of a bad headache. Staniford lurks around the ship for the rest of the day until dinner, which Lydia attends on account of Hicks bringing her some guava jelly and making her feel better. After dinner Staniford apologizes to Dunham for his rude comments about religion the night before. Dunham accepts his apology and begins to talk to Staniford about how he finds it interesting that Lydia has become of prime importance to all of the men. Dunham, unaware of Staniford's encounter with Lydia the night before, tells Staniford that he should get to know Lydia just as the rest of the men have. Staniford becomes defensive and accuses Dunham of having sexual relations with him. Dunham assures Staniford that he has not, but he is worried that Lydia may think that Dunham has generated feelings for her. Dunham asks Staniford to spend more time with Lydia in order to show her that his attention to her was out of kindness and nothing more. Staniford, shrewdly, replies that he does not know how to interact with a girl like Lydia and that Dunham must pay the penalty for his kindness and generosity. Later that evening, Staniford sees Lydia walking with Hicks around the deck just as he had done the night before. Lydia is laughing more freely than ever, which angers Staniford. The next day Lydia and Hicks sing and play music together much to both Staniford and Dunham's disappointment. Staniford tells Dunham of his plans to move out West once they return and to also live the bachelor life. A few days later Lydia and Hicks put on a concert to all of the crew's delight; Hicks is beginning to be seen in a more honorable light now that he is sober. After the concert Staniford tells Lydia that she must not forget about the little people from the Aroostook once she is a famous singer. Lydia does not answer and Staniford angrily tells her that he envies her ability to snub people with her silence. Lydia tells him that she does not know what he means and Staniford, struggling to find the right words, tells her that he is upset that she will not walk with him anymore. Lydia says that he has not asked her since the night that he tried to kiss her hand. Lydia then tells Staniford that she believes that Dunham has lost interest in her and her music. This makes Staniford feel much better knowing that Lydia has lost some interest for Dunham and the two begin to walk together again. The next day the first mate, Mr. Watterson, approaches Staniford and tells him that he does not like Hicks and that he believes that Hicks, once ashore, will be right back to drinking. He infers to Staniford that he ought to spend more time with Lydia in order to keep her away from Hicks. Lydia comes up on deck to look for a lost kerchief and Staniford asks her if she has come to walk with again. Lydia angrily asks why Staniford would think that and Staniford, quickly covering his tracks, says that it was more of a hope that she would want to walk with him and not really a question. Lydia is slightly embarrassed and apologetic and does indeed walk with Staniford. Staniford and Lydia begin to talk romantically and flirt just as they had done before and Staniford conveys to Lydia that he does not like her spending time with Hicks because he is a shabby man and he is not to be valued. As their talk continues Staniford cannot help himself from thinking about making to love to Lydia but seeing that it is almost midnight he sends her off to bed. Staniford then confronts Hicks and tells him that Lydia has no interest in either of them so he ought to leave her alone. As the weather changes and worsens so does Staniford; he hardens his heart and makes no attempts to speak with Lydia, much to her surprise. The storm arrives and makes Staniford very sick; he does not come out of his room until the ship arrives at Gibraltar. All of the crew, including Captain Jenness, Lydia and Hicks, leave to go to Gibraltar but Staniford and Dunham stay on board. Staniford tells Dunham that he is ashamed of himself for having recently cold to Lydia because it has caused her to take refuge once more with Hicks. The crew comes back with all but Hicks. Dunham admits that he lent Hicks five dollars and Staniford is furious. He tells Dunham that Hicks is no doubt passed out drunk somewhere in Gibraltar. Right before Captain Jenness is set to sail Hicks arrives back on board. He is sober and he immediately repays his debt to Dunham. The next morning Hicks misses breakfast but appears at dinner noticeably drunk. Dunham takes Thomas and Lydia on deck for dessert and Staniford then threatens to hit Hicks. Before the crew can grab Hicks and take him back to his bed he makes his way on deck but he sits away from the others. Eventually he begins to talk to Lydia and Staniford tells him to leave her alone and to go to bed. Hicks challenges Staniford to a fight and Lydia, never having seen a man so drunk, begins to cry. Hicks swings and Staniford but his lack of balance sends him overboard. Staniford jumps in after him and the crew lowers a life boat and saves the two men; Lydia is angered by the events and locks herself in her room. Captain Jenness tells Hicks that once they arrive in Messina he must leave the Aroostook and never return. From that point forward, Lydia keeps to herself and looks at Hicks and Staniford in disgust. When the ship arrives at Messina Staniford, out of kindness, offers some money to Hicks so that he can get himself back to Boston. Hicks takes the money and leaves the ship; Staniford feels that Hicks’ absence is worth twice the amount that he lent him. Staniford and Dunham decide to stay at a hotel in Messina while the Captain makes some repairs to the ship. Staniford is upset and does not understand why Lydia is mad at him instead of being congratulatory. He feels as if Lydia has begun to develop from an innocent girl into a mature woman because of the incident. Lydia had been a wilding rose bud in South Bradfield, now she was blossoming into a flower.Howells, p. 206. Staniford meets another woman in Messina and spends some time with her, but he is longing for Lydia the entire time. Once back on board the Aroostook, Lydia tells Staniford that she feels as if she has died and South Bradfield is earth and Venice is Heaven. The trip on the Aroostook is the journey between the two. Lydia tells Staniford that she pitied Hicks and she then praises Staniford for saving his life. Staniford proclaims to Lydia that he depends on her opinion of him for his peace of mind; Lydia, uncomfortably, does not know what to say and she abruptly leaves. Staniford, much to Dunham's disbelief, tells Dunham that he is in love with Lydia. Dunham cannot believe this because of their “inequalities” and Lydia's overall innocence.Howells, p. 220. Dunham tells Staniford that he must wait until they see Lydia in Venice to tell her of his feelings, mainly because Lydia may feel the same but she has not realized Staniford's feelings yet. As the days go on Staniford and Lydia draw nearer and nearer and make their planes to meet up in Venice. Staniford tells her that he living for the day that they can reunite in Venice. The Aroostook finally arrives in Trieste on a Friday and the crew takes the passengers’ baggage to a hotel. They all have their last meal together on the Aroostook that night. Staniford and Dunham leave before Lydia and she looks at Staniford with trust but a troubled wonder as well.Howells, p. 238. Later that evening, Staniford feels regret for not having told Lydia of his true feelings. He and Dunham go to one of the boats that will be leaving for Venice in an attempt to look for Lydia. Dunham goes aboard one of the ships but falls and hits his head, severely concussing himself. Staniford needs to watch over Dunham and he writes a letter to Lydia telling her of Dunham's fall and also that he will be a few days late to Venice. Lydia meets her Uncle Henshaw Erwin when she leaves the Aroostook. Henshaw is a tall, slender English man in his late fifties. He arrives with a maid named Veronica who is there to care for Lydia. Lydia finds this odd because she believes that she can take of herself. Henshaw is fascinated with Americans and likes to take notes about certain idioms that they use. During the entire trip to Venice he asks Lydia questions about America and about which phrases she commonly uses. They arrive in Venice at her aunt and uncle's house; it is a large home right on one of the canals in Venice. Lydia's room is lavish and large but she cannot help from crying and longing to be back in her room on the Aroostook. Lydia's aunt and uncle try their best to make her feel at home; Henshaw attempts to use American phrases to compliment and cheer her up. On Sunday morning, Aunt Josephine takes Lydia to church and lends her a bonnet so that she will fit in with the other girls who are attending. At the end of the sermon Lydia sings with the others and many curious heads turn to look once they hear her beautiful voice. After the sermon, an elderly woman named Lady Fenleigh asks Josephine if she will bring Lydia to her palace to sing. Josephine is thrilled that Lady Fenleigh likes Lydia because she thought that many of the other churchgoers would be envious of Lydia's beautiful voice. Later that afternoon a talented English artist, Mr. Rose-Black, stops by to see Josephine. He tells her that everybody at church was “enchanted” by Lydia's voice and he also asks if he can sketch Lydia; he is intrigued by not only her voice but also her beauty.Howells, p. 244. Several more guests arrive to see Josephine, but Lydia is very quiet and reserved. Later that evening, Josephine tells Henshaw that Lydia is terribly unresponsive and reserved and that it is hard to realize that Lydia is a simple village girl because her air, style and self-possession.Howells, p. 246. The next morning Josephine invites Lydia to her room for breakfast and tells her that Venice was only suitable climate for her health and that it took her a while to become accustomed to the English and Italian customs. Josephine continues to tell Lydia that she despise the English women in Italy, but by showing them that an American can be European than they are thrills her. She tells Lydia that she must reverse her American ideals in order to become as dull as the Europeans and that it will not be hard for her because of her innocence. Lydia then tells Josephine about her journey on the Aroostook and Josephine is appalled to hear that Lydia was the only woman on board. Lydia retorts that every man on the ship treated her with the utmost respect and that they are nicer and better that any of the people that she has met so far in Italy. She then realizes that Staniford had spent quite a considerable amount of time in Europe and that he could very well be just like the rest of them. This causes Lydia to doubt that Staniford ever had any true feelings for her and she begins to weep. Lydia tells Josephine about Staniford and about how he made her fall in love with him. Josephine listens and tells her that she knows of Staniford and his family and that a man like him could not have really loved Lydia, he was only flirting and being nice. Lydia tells Josephine that she believes that Staniford loves her and that he is coming to Venice later that day to see her. Josephine tells Henshaw about Lydia and Staniford and Henshaw is very reassuring saying that American men are more reserved and polite and that there is nothing to worry about. Henshaw says that Staniford is clearly coming to profess his love and to propose to Lydia. Lydia goes with Henshaw to row on the canals while Josephine stays behind to wait for Staniford. Staniford, however, never arrives and Lydia is embarrassed and upset. Dunham later wakes from his daze and is upset and ashamed of himself because he has caused Staniford to be late to Venice. Staniford assures him that it is alright because he wrote a letter to Lydia telling her of what happened. A porter then brings Staniford some letters and he fumbles through them; he realizes that the porter had accidentally brought back the letter that was intended for Lydia. Horrified, Staniford quickly arranges for Captain Jenness to take care of Dunham while he makes plans to take the next train to Venice. When Staniford arrives at the Erwin's home in Venice, Josephine is thrilled to see him and sends Lydia down to greet him. Staniford sees Lydia and it is a dream come true for him. Staniford immediately professes his love for her and Lydia tells him that she also loves him but she does not know if she can forgive him for leaving her hanging out to dry for so long. Staniford explains to Lydia what happened with Dunham and why his letter was never sent. This comforts Lydia a great deal but she still has concerns about what people will say about the two of them being together. Staniford assures her that he is deeply in love with her and that it does not matter what others think. Lydia finally admits to Staniford that he is a good man and Staniford responds by saying, “I’ll keep that praise till I’ve earned it.”Howells, p. 315. Six weeks later, Staniford and Lydia are married in the Campo Santi Apostoli Church in Venice. Dunham, Miss. Hibbard and Captain Jenness all come for the wedding. Jenness invites Staniford and Lydia to spend their honeymoon on the Aroostook; they respectfully decline because Staniford would surely become seasick again. The newly wed Mr. and Mrs. Staniford spend some time with Josephine and Henshaw in Venice and then the four of them leave for California. Staniford buys a ranch to work on and Josephine finds the climate of Santa Barbara easy to adapt to. After a few months, Staniford and Lydia travel to South Bradfield where they meet with Maria and Deacon Latham and other old friends of Lydia's.

At the beginning of the novel Lydia is a young innocent girl who has had little to no interactions with men. Throughout her journey on the Aroostook and her interactions with Staniford in particular, she begins to fall in love and pass from an innocent young girl to an experience mature woman. The love between Lydia and Staniford is considered to be very taboo at the time, not only because of how they came to be in love, during a journey in which Lydia was the only female on board the ship, but also because of the difference in their age and their status in society. The love and the bond between them breaks the previous barriers that had been set up by outdated customs and traditions. Critical reception The Publisher’s Weekly published on February 15, 1879, wrote about the upcoming book, The Lady of The Aroostook by William Dean Howells. They wrote that few readers think it will be his best work, but nevertheless Howells is a wonderful writer and “anyone who fails to read this, or any of Mr. Howells’ stories, misses a great pleasure.” Other William Dean Howells was published by H.O. Houghton and Company. Houghton was the cofounder of Houghton Mifflin and was also mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts; the city where he published Howells’ novel. Howells had a tenure as a writer for and an editor for the Atlantic Monthly. He published The Lady of the Aroostook over a period of twelve months in the Atlantic Monthly.

Hammersmark as he appeared in the late 1930s. Samuel Tellefson \\"Sam\\" Hammersmark (February 13, 1872 – 1957) was an American book publisher, trade union organizer, political activist, and Communist Party functionary. Hammersmark is best remembered as a political lieutenant of William Z. Foster in the Chicago anarcho-syndicalist and communist movements of the 1910s through the 1930s and as a candidate of the Communist Party for public office. Biography =Early years= Samuel T. Hammersmark was born February 13, 1872 in Kristiansand, Norway. His father was a carpenter who brought the family to America the same year that Samuel was born.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 95. The family settled in Chicago, Illinois, at time the second-largest city in the United States. It was there that Samuel Hammersmark attended public school. At the age of 13 Hammermark went to work as a clerk in a Chicago book store. The furore over the 1886 bombing at Chicago's Haymarket Square and the retaliatory executions of several leading members of the Chicago radical movement the following year was an early influence upon the boy and he became associated with the anarchist movement at an early age.James R. Barrett, William Z. Foster and the Tragedy of American Radicalism. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1999; pg. 62. The young Hammersmark's anarchism seems to have been individualistic and contemplative. Seeing no philosophical contradiction of principles, in 1889 Hammersmark quit work in order to begin study for the Christian ministry at Chesboro Seminary. He remained there until 1893. Just prior to his ordination, Hammersmark had a fundamental change of heart, declared himself an atheist, and began to search for existential meaning in the secular world.Randi Storch, Red Chicago: American Communism at Its Grassroots, 1928-35. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2007; pg. 14. The year 1893 was one of economic crisis, followed in 1894 by a massive strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company when it tried to impose wage cuts upon its workers. The railroad hub of Chicago was swept up in the turmoil when the fledgling American Railroad Union headed by Eugene V. Debs attempted to impose a boycott against all trains pulling Pullman cars. The boycott initially proved effective, and from June 29 to July 8, 1894 no trains left the city. Although the use of judicial injunctions and armed force eventually broke the strike, Hammersmark was inspired by the failed attempt of railroad workers to control their own economic destiny. Hammersmark next began a two and a half years of study of law. As was the case with the religious ministry, Hammersmark once again found his career path of choice to be not fully sympathetic, however, so in 1904 he briefly attempted to enter yet another field of occupation, launching a publishing house called the Hammersmark Publishing Company in Chicago.Storch, Red Chicago, pg. 15. A handful of books were produced, including works by philosophical anarchist Leo Tolstoy and Illinois Governor John Altgeld, a man who gained fame but lost election over his pardon of the surviving radicals imprisoned as a result of the Haymarket Affair. Hammersmark's interest in the radical labor movement moved him into a participatory role in 1905 when he attended in Chicago the founding convention of a new revolutionary industrial union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). At the convention Hammersmark came into contact with a number of leading American labor radicals, including former American Railroad Union head and Socialist Party of America founder Eugene V. Debs, mining union organizer Mother Mary Jones, Western Federation of Miners secretary \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood, and radical journalist and socialist theoretician Daniel DeLeon. Hammersmark became a convinced supporter of the IWW's strategy of competition with the established \\"conservative\\" unions of the American Federation of Labor — a policy known as dual unionism. Towards the end of the first decade of the 20th Century Hammersmark moved to Washington state, where he was active in the working class anarchist movement.Barrett, William Z. Foster and the Tragedy of American Radicalism, pg. 113. There he met a number of future leaders of the American radical movement, including in particular William Z. Foster and Jay Fox. =Union activity= In the summer of 1912, syndicalist leader William Z. Foster returned to Chicago to take a job as a railway car inspector after having spent the better part of a decade in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon in the Pacific Northwest.Edward P Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism: The Life of William Z. Foster. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994; pg. 69. He was joined there by Jay Fox, a friend who had edited an anarchist newspaper produced at the utopian Home Colony in the Puget Sound area of Western Washington. The pair attempted to establish a new anarcho- syndicalist organization in the industrial mecca of Chicago, hoping that their ideas about revolutionary unionism would there ignite.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pp. 69-70. Foster and Fox's organization, called the Syndicalist League of North America, was headquartered in a rooming house run by anarchist activist Lucy Parsons, widow of one of the best known victims of the Haymarket Affair of the 1880s.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 70. Hammersmark watched the origins of this organization from afar, living in Tacoma, Washington and editing an anarchist newspaper there called Why? through the beginning of June 1914.Ernesto A. Longa, Anarchist Periodicals in English Published in the United States (1833-1955). Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2010; pg. 269. To pay the bills, Hammersmark ran a tobacco shop in Tacoma, an enterprise which also stocked an array of Marxist and other radical political literature.Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964; pg. 236. Ultimately, however, the activities of Foster and Fox drew Hammersmark back to Chicago to participate in Syndicalist League activity there.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 71. In 1917 Hammersmark joined the Retail Clerks' International Protective Society, for which he worked as a general organizer until 1919. In 1919 he was also elected President of Chicago's Department Store Workers' Joint Council. Hammersmark was called into duty by William Z. Foster in the summer of 1919, during the Great Steel Strike, of which Foster was the lead organizer. Hammersmark was employed as the local organizer for the Youngstown, Ohio district during the bitter campaign to unionize American steel workers.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 134. After the defeat of the 1919 Steel Strike, Hammersmark became involved in the burgeoning movement to establish a Labor Party in America. In 1920 Hammersmark was elected as Secretary-Treasurer of the Cook County Labor Party, one of the organizational forerunners of the Labor Party of the United States.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 156. He remained at that post until submitting his resignation in May 1921. Despite leaving the post as chief functionary of the Chicago Labor Party organization, Hammersmark remained close to the national movement to establish a Farmer-Labor Party, appearing on the primary election ballot of the Cook County FLP in 1922. Hammersmith was elected to the Executive Board of the Chicago Federation of Labor in 1921. =Communist period= In December 1921 Hammersmark joined the newly established Workers Party of America, a \\"legal\\" Communist political party launched by the underground Communist Party of America.Sam Hammersmark interview by Oakley C. Johnson, 1940. Ruthenberg Papers, Ohio Historical Society, box 9, folder 3, microfilm reel 5. DeLeon's American Labor Who's Who has the date as 1923. He became active in the radical movement's efforts to defend political prisoners, and was employed as the Chicago secretary and a national organizer for the Labor Defense Council, a Communist Party mass organization formed in the aftermath of a government raid upon the 1922 Bridgman Convention of the underground Communist Party of America. Hammersmark was also active in the Communist Party's trade union affiliate, the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL), an organization headed by his longtime associate William Z. Foster.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 194. Although funded by the Communist International through the American Communist Party, the TUEL was essentially a parallel organization in its earliest phase, with the organization directed by a small circle in 1923 consisting of Foster, the man who brought him into the Communist orbit, Earl Browder, and key Chicago organizer Jack Johnstone — occasionally joined in their sessions by Hammersmark.Johannningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 221. Hammersmark ran for political office as a candidate of the Workers Party in 1924, standing for U.S. Congress in the Illinois 7th District. Hammersmark headed the Communist Party of Illinois' state ticket in November 1936 as the CPUSA's candidate for Governor.Communist Party of Illinois, Platform of the Communist Party, State of Illinois, for the Elections November, 1936. Chicago: Communist Party Election Committee, n.d. [1936]; pg. 8. =Later years, death, and legacy= In his later years, Hammersmark worked as the manager of the Modern Bookstore, the Communist Party's book shop in Chicago. Samuel T. Hammersmark died in 1957. His body was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

The village was founded in 1984 by the late Joe Delaney and later run by his son Chester Delaney before closing in 2011. Description Joe's Scarecrow Village was a collection of scarecrows located in a field beside the Cabot Trail, a Cape Breton highway with a high volume of tourists. The scarecrows were dressed in a variety of costumes, including fisherman, a wedding party, school children, celebrities and politicians. Joe Delaney, the attraction's creator, described the costumes as being similar to those traditionally worn by local Acadians for mi-carême festivities. The scarecrows were labelled with names and descriptions, with some of the scarecrows being memorials to local people. The Village featured a souvenir shop and snackbar. The attraction did not charge admission but accepted donations for the ongoing maintenance of the project. As a novel tourist site, Delaney was given an innovation award by the Cape Breton Tourist Association, and an honour roll award by the Tourist Industry Association of Nova Scotia.Terry Graff, Joe's Drive-in-Theatre of Scarecrows; Arts Atlantic 37, Spring/Summer 1990, page 2-3ref Politicians in scarecrow form Origins A scarecrow representing a Sydney Steel Corporation worker Joe's Scarecrow Village was started by Joe Delaney, a retired school janitor who planted a vegetable garden on his property in 1984. Delaney and his sons built three scarecrows intended to keep wild animals out of the vegetable garden. They set up the scarecrows in the garden at night, and the following morning found a charter bus and several cars parked on the side of the road. In all, there were more than 50 people in the field looking at the scarecrows and taking photos. According to Delaney, a woman from California said to him, \\"Joe, for the love of God, never mind your garden. Put up more scarecrows. That's what we want to see. If you can make those three, you can make more. And that's what people want to see. Instead of these gift shops and museums and all that.\\" This inspired Delaney to begin creating more scarecrows. In 1984, Delaney had created a total of 12 scarecrows; by 1985 this number grew to around 30, and by 1986 there were 46 scarecrows. In 1986 Joe's Scarecrows had approximately 18,000 visitors from around the world. By 1989, it had attracted over 27,000 visitors. At that time, Delaney referred to his Scarecrow Village as Joe's Drive-in Theatre of Scarecrows. Terry Graff, Joe's Drive-in-Theatre of Scarecrows; Arts Atlantic 37, Spring/Summer 1990, page 2-3ref 1986 Massacre At the end of the 1986 season on the eve of Armistice Day, Joe's Scarecrow Village was vandalized in what Delaney called the 1986 Massacre. 45 of the 46 scarecrows were destroyed—broken and cut apart. Delaney named the only remaining scarecrow \\"Rory\\" and dubbed him the lone survivor of the massacre. Delaney wrote an article, in the voice of Rory asking people to help repair the scarecrow village. The article was published in a local newspaper and Delaney received an outpouring of support including donations of old clothing and financial contributions. A teacher in British Columbia put on a play about Joe's Scarecrows to raise money for the restoration. The following season Delaney rebuilt the scarecrow village which grew to over 100 scarecrows. In popular culture Joe's Scarecrows was featured on episode 1 of the ITV program Billy Connolly: Journey to the Edge of the World in which Billy Connolly plays the banjo with the scarecrows and is surprised with a scarecrow made in his likeness. The attraction was also profiled in Bill Richardson's Scorned and Beloved: Dead of Winter Meetings with Canadian Eccentrics (1997) . The 1994 documentary Lawn and Order featured Joe's Scarecrows.

It arises through epigenetic modification (e.g., through HDAC, sirtuin, and G9a) and transcriptional regulation (primarily through ΔFosB's AP-1 complex) of genes in the nucleus accumbens. Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms =Role of HDAC inhibitors in cocaine addiction= Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors) have been implicated as a potential treatment for cocaine addicts. HDACs are enzymes that can deacetylate the histones associated with genes. This can activate genes for transcription. Several experiments have shown that inhibiting HDACs involved in histone H3K9 deacetylation reduces drug seeking behavior. It has been known that epigenetic regulations, such as the methylation of H3K9, have a key role in the mechanism of addiction. Recent studies have shown that administering HDAC inhibitors can help reduce the craving for cocaine in rats. Trichostatin A (TsA) is an HDAC inhibitor associated with reduced cocaine-seeking behaviors; it inhibits HDAC classes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 10. Since this HDAC inhibitor has such a significant effect on cocaine-seeking behaviors, scientists have speculated about their ability to reduce a cocaine addict's risk of relapse in the rat model system during rehab. After several tests in which rats were exposed to cocaine followed by either an HDAC inhibitor or a placebo, it was found that HDAC inhibitors had a significant effect on lowering cocaine-seeking behavior. This also suggests an epigenetic mechanism involved in HDAC chromatin regulation. The data is crucial to proving the hypothesis that trichostatin A can remodel chromatin structure and prevent behavioral changes following cocaine exposure. Tests also revealed that HDAC inhibitor administration can not only prevent addiction, but also helps reduce the risk of a relapse in cocaine addicts in the rat model system. = Role of HDAC5 = As the previous findings suggest, chronic cocaine use caused both alterations in the chromatin remodeling activity of HDACs and drug seeking behavior. Renthal et al. focused specifically on the class II histone deacetylase, HDAC5, since it was known to have activity-dependent regulation in neurons. In fact, they found that HDAC5 was a central regulator of the actions of chronic cocaine use and contributed to the behavioral adaptations with its deacetylase activity. Chronic cocaine injections increased HDAC5 phosphorylation at Ser259 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) within 30 minutes. This provides docking sites for 14-3-3 proteins, which mediate the export of HDAC5 out of the nucleus. They also found that CaMKII was necessary for depolarization-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation in NAc tissue, highlighting its role as a kinase for HDAC5. Experiments with mutant proteins and HDAC inhibitors suggested that HDAC5's action is mediated through its catalytic histone deacetylase domain. Rapid phosphorylation and the export of HDAC5 from the nucleus following cocaine use most likely leads to increased “pulses” of acetylation, targeted gene activation, and behavioral adaptations to long-term cocaine exposure. The second set of experiments that Renthal et al. performed showed that chronic cocaine use induced upregulation of the NK1 receptor protein in HDAC5 knockout mice, which is associated with hyperacetylation of H3 at the NK1R gene promoter. The NK1R gene promoter has been associated with enhanced response to cocaine reward, meaning HDAC5 in normal genomes may decrease cocaine reward with chronic cocaine exposure. They also found key pathways that were implicated in neural plasticity and reward behavior, which included DA receptor signaling, ATF2/CREB signaling, NF-κB, NFAT, cytoskeletal remodeling proteins, and ion channels. Their data implicated chromatin remodeling as a mechanism that drives altered gene activation and behavioral responses to cocaine. Using this they were able to conclude that within normal (wild type) genomes, the response to chronic cocaine includes phosphorylation of HDAC5 and export of the deacetylase out of the nucleus to activate downstream target genes. Between exposure and 24 hours after, HDAC5 returns to the cell nucleus to limit expression of these cocaine regulated genes by histone deacetylation. Their experiments with HDAC5 knockout mice lent additional support for this hypothesis. Since HDAC5 isn't there to limit the gene's expression, it begins to accumulate with repeated cocaine exposure, with the end result being increased sensitivity to cocaine reward. = Changes in critical H3K9me3 modifications = Modifications to histones such as methylations and acetylations can change gene expression patterns by activating or deactivating a region of DNA for transcription. The H3K9 position has been shown by several studies to be altered by chronic cocaine use. Addictive behavior observed from long-term cocaine users can be due to changes of the gene expression profiles in the brain's reward circuitry. Most research has been focused on the active regions of the reward-related genes, but Maze et al. focuses at what happens to the heterochromatic regions. Maze et al. showed that heterochromatic regions in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major reward circuit in the brain, are significantly altered in the H3K9me3 position. Acute cocaine exposure leads to a rapid increase in H3K9me3 within half an hour and decreases back to normal levels within 24 hours. Chronic cocaine exposure leads to a slower increase in H3K9me3 within an hour (although it reaches the same level as acute by this time) and a 50% decrease from normal baseline levels within 24 hours. This chronic exposure was proposed to decrease heterochromatization (destabilization) within this brain region in patients given repeated cocaine exposure, which implies that the long-term addictive behaviors are affected by this epigenetic mark. They used ChIP-seq to provide supporting evidence that the H3K9me3 modification is mainly localized to intergenic regions. In these areas of the genome, 17 regions of repeat elements (SINEs, LINEs, LTRs, etc.) had significant H3K9me3 state changes in chronic cocaine exposure mouse models. They used quantitative PCR to determine that of these significant elements, the LINE-1 region showed a significant increase in expression levels. LINE-1 is a retrotransposon, so expressing it inappropriately can activate the transposon to insert itself within important genes and destabilizing the DNA. They conclude their findings by suggesting that LINE-1 retrotransposon insertions cause inappropriate or disrupted expression of genes leading to the addictive behavior.  Role of G9a in changes to H3K9me2 modification  Like Maze et al., studies by Covington et al. focused on histone modification in the nucleus accumbens. They suggest that the H3K9me2 modification in this area of the brain plays a role in the stress and depression pathway. Their idea was that cocaine modifies this epigenetic mark and that ths increases an addict's vulnerability to stress and depression, which leads to the addictive effects of these reagents. A methyltransferase, G9a, was found to have reduced expression in the nucleus accumbens in cocaine addicts, therefore causing reduced H3K9me2 levels. The genes that are unsilenced via acetylation of the heterochromatin abnormally express the genes involved in BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway. This causes enhanced phosphorylation of CREB downstream in the pathway. CREB causes enhanced acetylation and dis-regulation of the stress and depression signaling pathways. Cocaine induces epigenetic changes that lead to neuronal morphology and behavioral changes. Most changes have to do with the disruption of heterochromatin caused by reduced levels of methylation on histones, namely H3K9. This decrease is mediated by the repression of G9a, a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase which is regulated by ΔFosB. ΔFosB is a cocaine-induced transcription factor that accumulates in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and acts to repress G9a. When ΔFosB is overexpressed, G9a levels are reduced, and H3K9 dimethylation levels are reduced in the NAc. Maze et al. was interested in determining how the reduced levels affects the behavior of cocaine users. Several studies were done in rats and it was concluded that G9a overexpression, and thus the presence of H3K9 dimethylation, caused a decreased preference for cocaine in rats. Researchers then looked at the nuclear volume of rats exposed to cocaine and found that down-regulation of G9a increased the amount of dendritic spines in the nucleus accumbens leading to increased cocaine-seeking behavior. Only in the nucleus accumbens do G9a levels matter for cocaine addiction. Studies have been done in which G9a levels and H3K9me2 levels were changed in other areas of the brain, but these other locations had no effect on the cocaine-seeking behavior of rats. = Gene expression studies in the mesolimbic pathway= The role of sirtuin deacetylases have also been shown to play a role in mediating cocaine addiction. To determine their role, the two transcription factors previously mentioned, ΔFosB and CREB, first had to be analyzed. It has been previously stated that ΔFosB increases the cocaine-seeking behavior of users. This is because ΔFosB has a uniquely stable structure that allows it to persist and accumulate in the body. Unlike ΔFosB, CREB is responsible for reducing sensitivity to cocaine which causes negative symptoms during the withdrawal period. Each of these transcription factors increases the cocaine-seeking behavior of addicts. Once this connection between transcription factors had been established, the researchers were curious if other genes caused addictive behaviors too and explored the ones that were significant markers for cocaine addiction, one of which, was the sirtuin gene family. Sirtuins are Class III NAD-dependent histone deacetylases. Not only do sirtuins deacetylate histones, but are also responsible for the deacetylation of tubulin, p53, and NFKB. Several studies have explored the role sirtuins played in cocaine-seeking behavior. In one set of experiments, it was found that a significant increase in ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens led to ΔFosB binding to the SIRT2 promoter. This increased binding caused acetylation of H3 which is associated with increased Sir2 mRNA. It was also found that the H3 acetylation induced by cocaine increased Sirt1 in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, repeated cocaine use causes an increase in both Sirt1 and Sirt2. Scientists were then interested in determining how increased Sirt1 and Sirt2 affected nuclear volume because it has been previously shown that repeated cocaine use does so. Scientists studying Sirt1 and Sirt2 have also found that these transcription factors led to increased nuclear volume. Therefore, it has been concluded that ΔFosB, CREB, Sirt1 and Sirt2 all play an integral role in cocaine-seeking behaviors. Kumar et al. focused on how acute and chronic cocaine exposure affected the striatum, which is another area of the brain involved in the reward and locomotor pathways. To study the molecular actions of cocaine in this region, researchers studied the histone modifications of three different promoters: cFos, BDNF, and Cdk5. They saw that cFos, which is normally expressed immediately after neurons fire action potentials, had high levels of H4 acetylation within 30 minutes of a cocaine injection – but no histone modifications were seen with chronic cocaine use. These results suggested that this promoter is activated by acute cocaine use and possibly means that the neurons it regulates fire rapidly during acute cocaine exposure, yet are not affected by long-term use. BDNF has been implicated as a critical regulator in drug dependency, and Cdk5 is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation genes. Both of these promoters were induced by chronic cocaine use (H3 hyperacetylation). Altering the natural acetylation states of these promoters in acute and chronic cocaine users altered the locomotor and reward responses to cocaine. This suggests that the behavioral activity observed by cocaine users can be attributed, in part, to the histone modifications at these promoter sites. McClung et al. discuss the gene expression profiles of previously mentioned CREB and ΔFosB as they are involved in cocaine use. These transcription factors have been shown to play a role in the short-term and long-term adaptive changes in the brain. CREB has been implicated in learning, memory, and depression and enriched in cocaine users within the nucleus accumbens. CREB seems to upregulate many genes in its pathway within the reward regions of the brain and seems to reduce the rewarding effects of cocaine and leads to depressive-like behaviors instead. The gene expression changes by CREB are induced by short-term cocaine treatment and eventually go back to normal. They also focused on ΔFosB, which is in the family of FosB proteins. While most of these proteins have been implicated in short-term abuse gene expression changes, McClung et al. demonstrated that ΔFosB gene expression changes in the NAc were induced by short-term and long-term cocaine exposure. Short-term cocaine exposure lead to the same expression profiles of upregulated genes as CREB did creating the reduced rewarding effects seen. However, long-term exposure lead to a different expression profile leading to increased rewarding effects. They suggested that ΔFosB acts as a repressor and somehow interacts with the CREB pathway and indirectly leads to the same short-term effects seen, but over time, acts to upregulate genes within its own pathway leading to the increased rewarding effects. It is unknown how these two pathways interact, but they have shown that there is some overlap. = Modifications to the gene expression of dopamine receptor pathways = Also involved in the CREB-Fos protein pathways is the dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1), expressed in neurons in the nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen regions. Zhang et al. focused on this receptor, as it is known to mediate the effects of cocaine. When stimulated, it increases cAMP levels, in turn leading to CREB activation. They had observed previous cocaine injections led to a direct increase in D1 receptor sensitivity. Through lines of D1 receptor mutant mice it had also been implicated in mediating both the locomotor sensation and rewarding effects of cocaine. Acute cocaine injections induced c-fos and CREB expression via D1 receptors and repeat cocaine administration, which associated with long lasting AP-1 transcription complexes containing ΔFosB. Persistent ΔFosB expression in D1 receptors in nucleus accumbens led to a significant increase in the locomotor-stimulating and rewarding effects of cocaine. Conversely, an increase of CREB was shown to decrease the rewarding effects of cocaine. Zhang et al. also used microarrays to identify specific genes induced by chronic cocaine use, which depend on a functional D1 receptor 24 hours after cocaine withdrawal. There were 109 genes identified that were either up or down regulated by 1.2 fold or more in the caudate putamen D1 receptor mutant mice after repeat injections. The expression of these genes was totally normal in mice with functional D1 receptors, suggesting chronic cocaine use had a direct influence on mediating these genes through a functional DRD1 receptor They found genes belonging to a number of functional groups, and chose six candidate genes from three of these functional groups to verify their differential expression in the caudate putamen. For each gene, researchers verified dependency of their expression on the D1 receptor after cocaine treatment using Trichostatin A or other receptor antagonists. Specifically, they focused on the genes encoding extracellular factors, receptors, modulators, and intracellular signaling molecules. These can be regulated by chronic cocaine treatment via D1 receptors, and all of the genes contain AP-1 transcriptional complex binding sites in their promoter regions. For extracellular signaling molecules, they looked at expression of the genes IGFBP6 and SDF1. Both of these were induced in the caudate putamen in wild type mice, but attenuated in the D1 receptor mutants. This suggests that IGFBP6 and SDF1 can be induced by repeat cocaine administration, and also that this interaction is partially dependent on a functional D1 receptor. = Direct changes to functional groups = Zhang et al. had previously seen that chronic cocaine administration leads to increased dendritic branching and spine density on medium spine neurons and prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, which may contribute to cocaine-induced neuroadaptations. When investigating the genes that were receptors and modulators, they found that expression of the sigma 1 receptor and RGS4 was not upregulated after repeat cocaine administration in DA D1 receptor mutants, suggesting functional dopamine D1 receptor is necessary for their induction. This receptor had been seen to modulate the rewarding effects of cocaine, and receptor antagonists had blocked the acute locomotor stimulating effect and lowered behavioral sensitization. Changes in the sigma 1 receptor have been shown to modulate dopamine release, so shifts in its expression can change the behavioral responses to cocaine with pre and post synaptic influences. They knew that RGS4 proteins can modulate G-protein-coupled receptor function, and since RGS4 levels can increase or decrease in response to D1/D2 receptor stimulation it could be involved in alterations of the signal transduction pathway after D1 receptor activation from repeat cocaine stimulation. For the genes that encoded intracellular signaling molecules, Zhang et al. focused on the Wrch1 gene. After experimentation researchers found Wrch1 was upregulated by repeat cocaine injections in the caudate putamen in D1 receptor mutants. There was no change in wild type mice, leading them to believe that Wrch1 may inhibit cocaine-induced and D1 receptor mediated behavioral changes. A key member of the Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin, was thought to be induced by chronic cocaine administration (which had been true in the nucleus accumbens) but acute cocaine reduced expression in the caudate putamen whereas chronic cocaine injections decreased expression even in the NAc in D1 receptor mutants. This pathway influences Wrch1, so it can also influence cocaine- induced neuroadaptations. Lastly, they found that CaMKII-α was not upregulated as expected, and CD2 was downregulated in D1 receptor mutants after chronic treatment. These results suggest gene expression changes are definitely induced by chronic cocaine exposure via the D1 receptor and most at AP-1 binding sites. = Alterations in the mesocorticolimbic system = Contrary to most studies focusing on the nucleus accumbens, Febo et al. suggested that the reward brain circuitry is not the only system involved in addictive behaviors. Previous knowledge has suggested that stimulants induce changes in gene expression in the main parts of mesolimbic circuitry (including the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex) and play a big role in development and maintenance of addicted state and chromatin remodeling. They applied this knowledge to investigate whether these gene expression changes are involved in cocaine related behavioral and molecular adaptations. They found unexpected patterns of brain activation in awake rats that were exposed to sodium butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor (or HDACi). An acute dose resulted in widespread BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) activation in the forebrain and midbrain, but cocaine-induced activation was significantly attenuated after repeat exposure. Sodium butyrate co-treatment with cocaine restored pronounced BOLD activation after successive cocaine treatments. These suggest that the brain's initial response to repeat cocaine exposure triggers a desensitization mechanism which can be overturned by pretreatment with sodium butyrate. The neural circuitry for the epigenetic modifications contributing to cocaine sensitivity was not the limited to the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (“reward system”) as they expected. Instead, they saw corticolimbic circuitry (implicated in emotion and memory) had a bigger role in HDACi related alterations of reward behaviors. Evidence that HDACi-mediated enhancement of a stimulant's sensitizing effects is context specific, and involves associative learning. Treatment , there is no effective approved pharmacotherapy for cocaine addiction. HDAC inhibitors have been implicated as a potential treatment for cocaine addiction. Cognitive behavioral therapy is currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addiction in general.

The Dobson Yacht Club sits on the western shore of the South Arm of Sydney Harbour, directly opposite the Sydney downtown area, part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Its location on the chart (4266 Sydney Harbour) is shown as Dobsons Point, formerly known as Shingle Point. History The Dobson Yacht Club came to be in the year was 1953 a time of relative prosperity in Cape Breton. Sydney Steel was booming and coal was still \\"King\\". It was a time of rebuilding and hard work following the war, but it was also a time when recreation was important as a diversion from the everyday realities of life. One such diversion was Snipe racing. These small sailing vessels provided an inexpensive form of entertainment. Sydney Harbour's only yacht club, the Royal Cape Breton was reaping the benefits of the increase in the number of Snipe racing enthusiasts. However, several members of the Royal Cape Breton's Snipe Sailing Fleet had become disillusioned with some of the restrictive practices of that club so they began to consider starting their own yacht club. They no assets, but they were attracted to a piece of land directly across the harbour called Shingle Point. There was safe anchorage on the southwest side of the property that would be ideal for the Snipe fleet. This property formed a part of the \\"Dobson Estate\\", located across the Westmount Highway from Shingle Point. This estate was an early land grant from the Crown to the Dobson family and so included all the rights to the water frontage bordering on the estate. In 1953, the estate belonged to Mr Sidney Dobson and several of his sisters. One of the sailors trying to establish this second Sydney Harbour yacht club was a young man named Roy Mac Keen. His mother was Myrtle Mac Keen, née Dobson, and she was one of the sisters in control of the Dobson Estate. She was also very sympathetic to the cause that had captured her son's attention. Negotiations began between the sailors and the Dobson family and a price of $3,000 was placed on the property. Twelve original members paid $100 each, plus a membership fee of $20. Some of the members fronted a loan for the balance and, in late 1953, adopting the name of its benefactor, The Dobson Yacht Club was born. The original clubhouse was a shack from the construction site of the then-new Federal Building on Dorchester Street. In the spring of 1954, the water's edge in the southwest cove was only 9–12 metres from the clubhouse itself. The next order of business was to purchase a new clubhouse. At this time the old military barracks on Royal Avenue, near the Sydney City Hospital, were being sold for one dollar each with the condition that they be removed from the site. After purchasing one of these buildings the members hired Mr W. Carson to move the building. This was done by separating the building in two and moving it through the streets of Sydney down to the Cape Breton Dairy on the waterfront and then floating the structures across the harbour on a barge in September 1955. During the mid-fifties to mid-sixties, the Snipe Sailing Team from Dobson became a force to be reckoned with in Maritime racing circles. The team won the Provincial Snipe Championships three times, the Maritime Championship three times and the Dominion Championship once. Many other trophies, including the McCurdy Cup (emblematic of the Championship of the Bras d'Or Lakes) took their place at Dobson.

It is a prequel to The Mysterious Benedict Society, taking place during the troubled childhood of Nicholas Benedict, a nine-year- old orphan and genius, and his friend, John Cole. Plot Nicholas Benedict, a nine-year-old orphan and genius, moves to the Rothschild Manor orphanage after being removed from his previous orphanage, Littleview, because of his narcolepsy, a condition that sends him into deep sleep at unexpected moments, and, in Nicholas' case, often whilst he is laughing or experiencing strong emotion. Because of his condition, he is forced to sleep in a room all by himself that is locked each night by the director, Mr. Collum, instead of in the dormitory with all the other boys. The room had a window that was blocked up to prevent Nicholas from sneaking about through it. Nicholas, however, is able to remove the mortar as it had not dried properly. He quickly becomes friends with a scarred-faced boy named John, and enemies with the orphanage bullies: Iggy, Breaker, and Moray, or as they are more commonly referred to, the Spiders. He outwits the Spiders when they try to harm him, causing their hatred to increase. Because of his intellect, Nicholas comes up with an idea to be able to let himself out of his room at night. When the director escorts him to the washroom one night to allow him to brush his teeth, Nicholas pretends he forgot his brush, and so the director gives him the key and allows him to run back to his room to fetch it. Instead, he takes a candle out of its sconce, and presses the key into the soft wax to make an impression of it, and runs back to the washroom with the key and his toothbrush. During metalworking class, he made the imprint into a key, which he finds is a skeleton key. This allows him to wander all around the manor during the night and access many places, which comes in handy, as Nicholas finds out of the legend of huge treasure being hidden in the Manor, and with his friends John and Violet (a girl who lives on a nearby farm and is deaf), he does his best to find it. When John gets adopted, and the Spiders burn John's letter, Nicholas escapes from the orphanage. He then discovers a government attorney who acts kindly to him. Wanting to be like the government attorney, he returns to the orphanage. He then discovers that John was adopted by Violet's family. Violet, who wants to go to art school, plans on giving up going to art school so that Nicholas can be adopted by them, too. Nicholas, however, refuses. He then discovers that the treasure was nothing more than a library. Characters Nicholas Benedict: An extremely gifted 9-year-old boy, with a condition called narcolepsy.

The FSL construct is a peptide-based partially carboxymethylated oligoglycine (CMG2) spacer with 1,2- dioleoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipid. Kode Biotech Limited Function- Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs (Kode Technology) are amphiphatic, water dispersible biosurface engineering constructs that can be used to engineer the surface of cells, viruses and organisms, or to modify solutions and non- biological surfaces with bioactives. FSL Kode constructs spontaneously and stably incorporate into cell membranes. FSL Kode constructs with all these aforementioned features are also known as Kode Constructs. The process of modifying surfaces with FSL Kode constructs is known as \\"koding\\" and the resultant \\"koded\\" cells, viruses and liposomes are respectively known as kodecytes, and kodevirions. Technology description All living surfaces are decorated with a diverse range of complex molecules, which are key modulators of chemical communications and other functions such as protection, adhesion, infectivity, apoptosis, etc. Functional-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs can be synthesized to mimic the bioactive components present on biological surfaces, and then re-present them in novel ways. The architecture of an FSL Kode construct, as implicit in the name, consists of three components - a functional head group, a spacer, and a lipid tail. This structure is analogous to a Lego minifigure in that, they have three structural components, with each component having a separate purpose. In the examples shown in all the figures, a Lego 'minifig' has been used for the analogy. However, it should be appreciated that this is merely a representation and the true structural similarity is significantly varied between Lego minifigures and FSL Kode constructs (fig 1). The functional group of an FSL is equivalent to a Lego minifigure head, with both being at the extremity and carrying the character functional components. The spacer of the FSL is equivalent to the body of the Lego minifigure and the arms on the minifigure are representative of substitutions which may be engineered into the chemical makeup of the spacer. The lipid of the FSL anchors it to lipid membranes and gives the FSL construct its amphiphatic nature which can cause it to self-assemble. Because the lipid tail can act directly as an anchor it is analogous to the legs of a Lego minifigure. Flexible design The functional group, the spacer and the lipid tail components of the FSL Kode construct can each be individually designed resulting in FSL Kode constructs with specific biological functions. The functional head group is usually the bioactive component of the construct and the various spacers and lipids influence and effect its presentation, orientation and location on a surface. Critical to the definition of an FSL Kode construct is the requirement to be dispersible in water, and spontaneously and stably incorporate into cell membranes. Other lipid bioconjugates that include components similar to FSLs but do not have these features are not termed as Function-Spacer-Lipid Kode constructs. =Functional groups= Fig. 2 Diagram showing the features of the function- spacer-lipid construct of a kodecyte, using the analogy of a Lego minifigure. As indicated in the figure, the function group analogous to the minifigures head can be arranged in different substances, the spacer analogous to the body of the minifigure (including the arms) can have a variety of different features, and the lipid or minifigure legs can be a variety of different lipids. Together the three components of function, spacer & lipid represent the FSL construct. Kode Biotech Limited A large range of functional groups have already been made into FSL Kode constructs. These include: * Carbohydrates – ranging from monosaccharides to polysaccharides and including blood group antigens, hyaluronic acid oligomers and sialic acid residues * Peptide/protein – ranging from single amino acids to proteins as large as antibodies * Labels – including fluorophores, radioisotopes, biotin, etc. * Other – chemical moieties such as maleimide, click residues, PEG, charged compounds Note 1: Multimeric – the presentation of the F residue can be as multimers with controlled spacing and be variable. Note 2: Mass – the mass that can be anchored by an FSL Kode constructs can range from 200 to >1x106 Da =Spacers= The spacer is an integral part of the FSL Kode construct and gives it several important characteristics including water dispersibility. * Length – the spacer can be varied in length, for example 1.9 nm (Ad), 7.2 nm (CMG2), 11.5 nm (CMG4), allowing for enhanced presentation of Functional groups at the biosurface. * Optimizes 'F' presentation – The presentation of the bioactive (functional group) on a spacer reduces steric hindrance and increases the bioactive surfaces exposed and available for interactions * Rigidity – the spacer can be modified to be either flexible or rigid depending upon desired characteristics * Substitutions (represented by the leaves on the stalk) – the spacer can be modified both in charge, and polarity. * Branches – usually the spacer is linear, but it can also be branched including specific spacing of the branches to optimize presentation and interaction of the F group. * Inert – important to the design of FSL Kode constructs is the biologically inert nature of the spacer. Importantly this feature means the S-L components of the constructs are unreactive with undiluted serum. Consequently, the constructs are compatible in vivo use, and can improve diagnostic assay sensitivity by allowing for the use of undiluted serum. =Lipids= The lipid tail is essential for enabling lipid membrane insertion and retention but also for giving the construct amphiphilic characteristics that enable hydrophilic surface coating (due to formation of bilipid layers). Different membrane lipids that can be used to create FSLs have different membrane physiochemical characteristics and thus can affect biological function of the FSL. Lipids in FSL Kode constructs include: * Diacyl/diakyl e.g. DOPE * Sterols e.g. cholesterol * Ceramides  Optimising functional group (F) presentation  One of the important functions of an FSL construct is that it can optimise the presentation of antigens, both on cell surfaces and solid-phase membranes. This optimisation is achieved primarily by the spacer, and secondarily by the lipid tail. In a typical immunoassay, the antigen is deposited directly onto the microplate surface and binds to the surface either in a random fashion, or in a preferred orientation depending on the residues present on the surface of this antigen. Usually this deposition process is uncontrolled. In contrast, the FSL Kode construct bound to a microplate presents the antigen away from the surface in an orientation with a high level of exposure to the environment. Furthermore, typical immunoassays use recombinant peptides rather than discrete peptide antigens. As the recombinant peptide is many times bigger than the epitope of interest, a lot of undesired and unwanted peptide sequences are also represented on the microplate. These additional sequences may include unwanted microbial related sequences (as determined by a BLAST analysis) that can cause issues of low level cross-reactivity. Often the mechanism by which an immunoassay is able to overcome this low level activity is to dilute the serum so that the low level microbial reactive antibodies are not seen, and only high-level specific antibodies result in an interpretable result. In contrast, FSL Kode constructs usually use specifically selected peptide fragments (up to 40 amino acids), thereby overcoming cross-reactivity with microbial sequences, and allowing for the use of undiluted serum (which increases sensitivity). The F component can be further enhanced by presentation of it in multimeric formats and with specific spacing. The four types of multimeric format include linear repeating units, linear repeating units with spacing, clusters, and branching (Fig. 4).  Mechanisms of interaction  = Amphiphilic FSL Kode construct = The FSL Kode construct by nature of its composition in possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are amphiphilic (or amphipathic). This characteristic determines the way in which the construct will interact with surfaces. When present in a solution they may form simple micelles or adopt more complex bilayer structures with two simplistic examples shown in Fig. 5a. More complex structures are expected. The actual nature of FSL micelles has not been determined. However, based on normal structural function of micelles, it is expected that it will be determined in part by the combination of functional group, spacer and lipid together with temperature, concentration, size and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity for each FSL Kode construct type. Surface coatings will occur via two theoretical mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a monolayer of FSL at the surface (Fig. 5b). Hydrophobic binding of the FSL will be via its hydrophobic lipid tail interacting directly with the hydrophobic (lipophilic) surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers as the lipid tail is unable to react with the hydrophilic surface. In this case the lipids will induce the formation of a bilayer, the surface of which will be hydrophilic. This hydrophilic membrane will then interact directly with the hydrophilic surface and will probably encapsulate fibres. This hydrophilic bilayer binding is the expected mechanism by which FSLs are able to bind to fibrous membranes such as paper and glass fibres (Fig. 5c) and (Fig. 9). = Lipid membrane modification = After labeling of the surface with the selected F bioactives, the constructs will be present and oriented at the membrane surface. It is expected that the FSL will be highly mobile within the membrane and the choice of lipid tail will effect is relative partitioning within the membrane. The construct unless it has flip-flop behavior is expected to remain surface presented. However, the modification is not permanent in living cells and constructs will be lost (consumed) at a rate proportional to the activity at the membrane and division rate of the cell (with dead cells remaining highly labeled). Additionally, when present in vivo with serum lipids FSLs will elute from the membrane into the plasma at a rate of about 1% per hour. In fixed cells or inactive cells (e.g. red cells) stored in serum free media the constructs are retained normally. Liposomes are easy koded by simply adding FSL Kode constructs into the preparation. Contacting koded liposomes with microplates or other surfaces can cause the labeling of the microplate surface. = Non-biologic surface interaction = Non-biologic surface coatings will occur via two mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a monolayer of FSL at the surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers, which probably either encapsulate fibres or being via the hydrophilic F group. This is the expected mechanism by which FSLs bind to fibrous membranes such as paper and glass fibres. A recent study has found that when FSL Kode constructs are optimised, could in a few seconds glycosylate almost any non-biological surface including metals, glass, plastics, rubbers, and other polymers.  Technology features  The technological features of FSL Kode constructs and the koding process can be summarized as follows: * Rapid and simple – simple contact for 10–120 minutes and constructs spontaneously and stably incorporate – no washing required. * Replicable – same variables (time, temperature, concentration) equals the same result. * Toxicity – FSL constructs are biocompatible, disperse into biological solutions without solvents, detergents. They label non-covalently and are non-genetic. Normal vitality and functionality is maintained in modified cells/virions/organisms. Toxicity/vitality experiments in small laboratory animals, zebrafish, cell cultures, spermatozoa and embryos find no toxic effects within physiological ranges. * Amphiphilic – the amphiphilic nature of the FSL Kode construct makes them water dispersible (clear solution of micelles), yet once interacted with a membrane they insert/coat and become water resistant * Variable design – a single F can be presented in more than 100 ways by varying the spacer and lipid. * High biovisibility – as the spacer holds the F moiety away for the membrane it is able to achieve increased sensitivity, specificity and reactivity can be optimized by use of multiple and variable biomarker presentations on the same surface. * Additive – FSL modification is compatible with other technologies allowing users to add additional features to cells/viruses/organisms/surfaces already modified by more traditional methods. Multiple FSL constructs may be added to a surface simultaneously by simply creating a mix of FSL Kode constructs. Constructs insert into living or fixed cell (glutaraldehyde) membranes. Fig. 8 FSLs can be easily created from 400x400px * Simple FSL peptide synthesis – there is a reactive-functional- group FSL Kode construct with maleimide as its functional group which can be used for preparation of FSLs from cysteine-containing peptides, proteins or any other thiols of biological interest. The effective synthetic approach is based on the well-known Michael nucleophilic addition to maleimides (Fig. 7). * Synthetic \\"Gylcolipids\\" – one family of the FSL constructs are synthetic glycolipids with well-defined hydrophobic tails and carbohydrate head groups = Koded membranes surfaces and solutions = FSL constructs have a wide range of uses and they have been used to modify the following: * Cells – blood cells, culture lines, embryos, spermatozoa * Viruses – influenza, measles, varicella * Organisms – parasites, microbes, zebrafish * Liposomes – also micelles, lipid particles * Surfaces/fibres – hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes/fibres, paper, nitrocellulose, cotton, silk, glass, Teflon, silica, magnetic beads (microspheres) etc. * Solutions – saline, plasma/serum, culture media  Methodology for FSL use (koding)  400x400px FSL constructs, when in solution (saline) and in contact, will spontaneously incorporate into cell and virus membranes. The methodology involves simply preparing a solution of FSL constructs in the range of 1–1000 μg/mL. The actual concentration will depend on the construct and the quantity of construct required in the membrane. One part of FSL solution is added to one part of cells (up to 100% suspension) and they are incubated at a set temperature within the range of 4–37 °C (39–99 °F) depending on temperature compatibility of the cells being modified. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of FSL insertion into the membrane. For red blood cells, at 37 °C incubation for 2 hours achieves >95% insertion with at least 50% insertion being achieved within 20 minutes. In general, FSL insertion time of 4 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 4 °C gives results similar to 1 hour at 37 °C for carbohydrate based FSLs inserting into red blood cells. The resultant kodecytes or kodevirions do not required to be washed, however this option should be considered if an excess of FSL construct is used in the koding process.  Applications  FSL Kode constructs have been used for research and development, diagnostic products, and are currently being investigated as potential therapeutic agents. = Kodecytes = FSL have been used to create human red cell kodecytes that have been used to detect and identify blood group allo-antibodies as ABO sub-group mimics, ABO quality control systems, serologic teaching kits and a syphilis diagnostic. Kodecytes have also demonstrated that FSL-FLRO4 is a suitable reagent for labelling packed red blood cells (PRBC) at any point during routine storage and look to facilitate the development of immunoassays and transfusion models focused on addressing the mechanisms involved in tansfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM). Murine kodecytes have been experimentally used to determine in vivo cell survival, and create model transfusion reactions. Zebrafish kodecytes have been used to determine real time in vivo cell migration. Kodecytes have been used to create influenza diagnostics. Kodecytes which have been modified with FSL-GB3 were unable to be infected with the HIV virus. = Kodevirions = Kodevirions are FSL modified viruses. Several FSL Kode constructs have been used to label viruses to assist in their flow-cytometric visualisation and to track them real time distribution in animal models. They have also been used to modify the surface of viruses with the intention of targeting them to be used to attach tumors (oncolytic). = Kodesomes = Kodesomes are liposomes that have been decorated with FSL Kode constructs. These have been used to deposit FSL constructs onto microplates to create diagnostic assays. They also have the potential for therapeutic use. = Koded solutions = These are solutions containing FSL Kode constructs where the construct will exist as a clear micellular dispersion. FSL-GB3 as a solution/gel has been used to inhibit HIV infection and to neutralise Shiga toxin. FSL blood group A as a solution has been used to neutralise circulating antibodies in a mouse model and allow incompatible blood group A (murine kodecytes) transfusion. This model experiment was used to demonstrate the potential of FSLs to neutralise circulating antibody and allow for incompatible blood transfusion or organ transplantation. = Koded surfaces = standard desktop inkjet printer directly onto paper to create immunoassays. Image is a typical example of an inkjet printed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) where 12 different FSL constructs were printed as identifying codes on paper and then reacted against different samples. The antibody activity in the samples can be identified by appearance of words identifying the target antigen. An empty inkjet cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, barcodes, or graphics are printed. A Perspex template is adhered to the surface to create reaction wells. The method is then a standard EIA procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical EIA procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA detection antibody, incubate, wash, add NBT/BCIP precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing. The end result is stable for years.541x541px All FSL Kode constructs disperse in water and are therefore compatible with inkjet printers.

The method is then a standard EIA procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA conjugate, incubate, wash, add NBT/BCIP precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing (Fig. 9). The end result is stable for years.

Situated along Tualatin Valley Highway, the 18-tenant center takes its name from Shute Park, which is located across the highway. The land the mall sits on was once part of the park, housing a baseball diamond. Shute Park Plaza opened in 1985 at a cost of $6 million. History The land that became Shute Park Plaza was sold to the city in 1906 by banker John W. Shute to become Hillsboro's first park.\\"Park site sold to city by banker Shute in ‘06\\", Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. In 1972, the city decided to re-zone a section of the park in order to maximize the value of the land in preparations to sell that section. That section was located across Tualatin Valley Highway and contained a baseball field that had hosted home games for Hillsboro High School until 1965. Due to being physically separated from the other section of the park, the park's department wanted to sell off the land in order to pay for improvements at other park facilities in the city. The parcel was eventually sold in 1978 to Howard Davis, a former mayor, and Howard Glesmann for $250,000, with the funds planned to be used for city-owned facilities at the Washington County Fairgrounds. However, the city also accidentally sold off a small section from the other side of the highway, which was re-sold to the city shortly thereafter. That plot was sold to the city for $51,400, which led to an investigation by the county district attorney in 1981. The district attorney declined to take action, though the City Council cited city manager Eldon Mills and his staff for negligence in the matter. Eventually the land was sold to developers to build a shopping center. A groundbreaking ceremony for the new $6 million center was held on May 29, 1985, for the shopping center on site of the former baseball field, with Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman officiating. At that time, it was expected to open in October 1985 with 25 to 30 tenants. The center was developed by Hayden Corp. and designed by David Hickman Associates. The L shaped building was originally to include freestanding pads for a bank and a fast food restaurant. Construction also included adding a traffic signal on Tualatin Valley Highway. Oak Unlimited opened at the center in 1986, as did Pro Am Sports. Izzy's Pizza built a stand-alone restaurant at the center in 1987. In 1996, owner WCB Properties nearly sold the plaza along with five other of its properties to ScanlanKemperBard Compaines. The next year, WCB sold Shute Park Plaza as part of a series of sales to Spieker Properties worth a total of $123 million, with Spieker then selling the plaza to Pan Pacific Retail Properties in February 1998. Pan Pacific's purchase was for $30.4 million and included four shopping centers total in Oregon. Pan Pacific sold the shopping center in September 2002 to Shute Park Plaza Partners LLC for $6.3 million. The new ownership company was owned by Martin Kehoe. Also in 2002, La Boutique opened in the plaza, selling quinceañeras in the Hispanic neighborhood. In 2005, ownership of the center was transferred to Shute Park Plaza LLC for $8.5 million. Black Rock Coffee Bar opened a drive-thru kiosk at Shute Park in 2011. Details Western portion of the shopping center Shute Park Plaza is located along Tualatin Valley Highway in the southeast part of Hillsboro, across from Shute Park at the point where the highway curves to become Tenth Avenue. The main building is an 'L' shape, which has of gross leasable area. Additionally, there are two restaurant pads along the TV Highway frontage. The originally $6 million center is anchored by Izzy's and Baxter Auto Parts. Other tenants include restaurants, retail shops, and professional offices.

Various types of frequency meters are used. Many are instruments of the deflection type, ordinarily used for measuring low frequencies but capable of being used for frequencies as high as 900 Hz. These operate by balancing two opposing forces. Changes in the frequency to be measured cause a change in this balance that can be measured by the deflection of a pointer on a scale. Deflection-type meters are of two types, electrically resonant circuits and ratiometers. An example of a simple electrically resonant circuit is a moving-coil meter. In one version, this device has two coils tuned to different frequencies and connected at right angles to one another in such a way that the whole element, with attached pointer, can move. Frequencies in the middle of the meter's range cause the currents in the two coils to be approximately equal and the pointer to indicate the midpoint of a scale. Changes in frequency cause an imbalance in the currents in the two coils, causing them, and the pointer, to move. Another type of frequency meter, Weston Frequency meter is not of the deflection type, is the resonant reed type, ordinarily used in ranges from 10 to 1,000 Hz, although special designs can operate at lower or higher frequencies. The main principle of working of weston type frequency meter is that \\"when an current flows through the two coils which are perpendicular to each other, due to these currents some magnetic fields will produce and thus the magnetic needle will deflects towards the stronger magnetic field showing the measurement of frequency on the meter\\". Construction of weston frequency is as compared to ferrodynamic type of frequency meter. In order to construct a circuit diagram we need two coils, three inductors and two resistors. Axis of both coils are marked as shown. Scale of the meter is calibrated such that at standard frequency the pointer will take position at 45°. Coil 1 contains a series resistor marked R1 and reactance coil marked as L1, while the coil 2 has a series reactance coil marked as L2 and parallel resistor marked as R2. The inductor which is marked as L0 is connected in series with the supply voltage in order to reduce the higher harmonic means here this inductor is working as a filter circuit. Let us look at the working of this meter. Now when we apply voltage at standard frequency then the pointer will take normal position, if there increase the frequency of the applied voltage then we will see that the pointer will moves towards left marked as higher side as shown in the circuit diagram. Again we reduce the frequency the pointer will start moving towards the right side, if lower the frequency below the normal frequency then it cross the normal position to move towards left side marked lower side as shown in the figure. Now let us look at the internal working of this meter. Voltage drop across an inductor is directly proportion to frequency of the source voltage, as we increase the frequency of the applied voltage the voltage drop across the inductor L1 increase that means the voltage impressed between the coil 1 is increased hence the current through the coil 1 increase while the current through the coil 2 decreases. Since the current through the coil 1 increases the magnetic field also increases and the magnetic needle attracts more towards the left side showing the increment in the frequency. Similar action will takes if decrease the frequency but in this the pointer will moves towards the left side. richardsradios.co.uk These work by means of tuned steel reeds that vibrate like a tuning fork, under the effect of electric current through a coil; only those reeds that are in resonance vibrate visibly.britannica.com See also * Frequency counter * Reed receiver References Category:Electrical meters Category:Electronic test equipment ","title":"Frequency meter"},{"id":"35823123","text":"Alamabad (, also Romanized as ‘Ālamābād; also known as ‘Ālemābād) is a village in Qaleh Zari Rural District, Jolgeh-e Mazhan District, Khusf County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

His first film, Antoś pierwszy raz w Warszawie (Antoś for the First Time in Warsaw) premiered October 22, 1908. It is the earliest surviving Polish feature film and considered to be the founding date of Polish Film. He is considered to be the first recognizable star of Polish Cinema. His favorite brand of comedy was farce, which with the help of musical comedy revived his career in the 1930s. Besides his film and stage career, his favorite hobby was bicycling.  Early career  Antoni Fertner had a prominent stage career before film, performing in many theaters and cabaret's. His first film was Antoś for the First Time in Warsaw (Antoś pierwszy raz w Warszawie). While visiting Warsaw from Moscow to Paris, Joseph Meyer and Ferner produced this short comedy. Fertner commissioned and starred in the film. It premiered October 22, 1908 at the Oaza Cinema, a theater which he co-owned, to a full house of 180 people. Ferner's talent was noticed from the beginning and he was one of the most successful film professionals of the time. He formed a production company with fellow actors, Julian Krzewiński, Wincenty Rapacki, Juliusz Zagrodzki and cameraman, Stanislaw Sebel. They specialized in comedy featuring films starring Fertner.  Move to Moscow  After fleeing to Moscow, Russia during World War I, he signed with the Russian Lucifer Company in 1915. This led to the creation of Antosha (Tony in Russian) and the Antosha series. His character has been compared to France's Max Linder and America's Sidney Drew. He starred in 24 films as Antosha, however, as most pre- revolution Russian films, many from the series are gone. He appeared in over 30 Russians films earning the nickname “the Russian Max Linder.”  Return to Poland  After the Bolshevik takeover, Fertner returned to Poland. He appeared in only 2 films in the 1920s. However, the popularity of musical comedy mixed with his forte, farce comedy, he revived his career. During the 1930s, he appeared in over 15 films, including many important classic Polish musical comedies such as Ada! Don't Do That (1936) and The Forgotten Melody (1938). After World War II, he performed in numerous Kraków theatre's. However, he would never appear in any postwar films. His last film appearance is The Vagabonds (1939).

New York University Press, 1998. . (formally An Act to Amend Ontario Statutes to Provide for the Equal Treatment of Persons in Spousal Relationships), commonly known as Bill 167, was a proposed law in the Canadian province of Ontario, introduced by the government of Bob Rae in 1994, which would have provided same-sex couples with rights and obligations mostly equal to those of opposite-sex common law couples by amending the definition of \\"spouse\\" in 79 provincial statutes. Despite the changes, the bill did not formally confer same-sex marriage rights in the province, as the definition of marriage in Canada is under federal jurisdiction; instead, the bill proposed a status similar to civil unions for same-sex couples, although it was not explicitly labelled as such since the term was not yet in widespread international use. The legislation was in part a response to a 1992 ruling by the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal in the case of Michael Leshner and Michael Stark,\\"Homosexual rights, jobs main issues in by-election Tories attack Liberals, NDP over same-sex spousal benefits\\". The Globe and Mail, March 14, 1994. which obligated the government to provide spousal benefits to same-sex partners of government employees.\\"Ontario won't appeal gay rights ruling; Group says there's no political will to end discrimination in provincial laws\\". Ottawa Citizen, September 29, 1992. The bill was first introduced in the legislature on May 17, 1994, by Attorney General Marion Boyd. The bill passed first reading by a recorded vote of 57 to 52. Vocal opposition increased between first and second reading as public opposition to the bill began to mount so, in an attempt to salvage the bill on second reading, Boyd dropped controversial provisions such as adoption rights. The move did not win any new support for the bill and it was defeated by a recorded vote of 68 to 59 on second reading on June 9, 1994. Victoria—Haliburton by-election Liberal leader Lyn McLeod had long pledged her party's support for legislation extending civil rights to same-sex couples; Liberal MPP Tim Murphy, who represented the riding that included Toronto's Church and Wellesley gay village, had even drafted and presented a similar albeit less sweeping private member's bill, Bill 45, which passed first reading in the legislature in June 1993 but was delayed as the government prepared Bill 167. However, the party's response to the issue was dramatically altered by a provincial by-election in Victoria—Haliburton on March 17, 1994, following the resignation of Dennis Drainville. With the Liberals holding a strong lead in provincewide polling at the time, Liberal candidate Sharon McCrae had been widely expected to win the resulting by- election, but the tide changed when the local Progressive Conservative riding association ran a campaign ad: The ad resulted in Progressive Conservative candidate Chris Hodgson quickly gaining support at the expense of McCrae, and ultimately winning the by-election. Bill 167 consequently came to be seen by the Liberal party as an electoral liability, causing \\"great panic\\" in the caucus and leading several Liberal MPPs to switch sides on the issue. As a result, McLeod chose to withdraw the party's support of the bill, and just three Liberal MPPs — including Murphy, who remained the bill's single most vocal supporter — continued to support it. Several federal Liberal MPs, including Jean Augustine, Barry Campbell, Bill Graham, Shaughnessy Cohen and Hedy Fry, intervened to encourage McLeod not to withdraw support, to no avail.\\"Cohen backs same-sex bill\\". Windsor Star, June 2, 1994. While the withdrawal of Liberal support did not kill the bill by itself, as the New Democrats still had enough votes to pass it if their caucus had been united, twelve New Democratic MPPs were also opposed to the legislation. Rae ultimately permitted a free vote on the bill within his caucus, albeit with the warning that he would not support the dissenting MPPs if they ran for re- election in the 1995 election. Outside opposition Opposition to the legislation was also noted outside the legislature. Aloysius Ambrozic, the archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto stated his objections to the bill granting same-sex couples equal standing to opposite-sex ones, although he insisted that he did not oppose protecting the rights of individual homosexual people. Don Pennell, the leader of the minor socially- conservative Family Coalition Party of Ontario, was quoted as saying that \\"homosexuals may choose to behave in a certain way but it is wrong for the government to legally sanction and support these choices. This legislation would have put heterosexual and homosexual relationships on virtually the same level, which is morally reprehensible and economically foolish.\\" Final vote The final recorded vote on the second reading of Bill 167 was as follows: =Yeas: 59= *New Democrats: Zanana Akande, Richard Allen, Gilles Bisson, Marion Boyd, Elmer Buchanan, Jenny Carter, Brian Charlton, David Christopherson, Marilyn Churley, Dave Cooke, Shirley Coppen, George Dadamo, Noel Duignan, Derek Fletcher, Bob Frankford, Evelyn Gigantes, Ruth Grier, Christel Haeck, Howard Hampton, Margaret Harrington, Karen Haslam, Randy Hope, Bob Huget, Norm Jamison, Paul Johnson, Paul Klopp, Peter Kormos, Frances Lankin, Floyd Laughren, Wayne Lessard, Bob Mackenzie, Ellen MacKinnon, Gary Malkowski, Rosario Marchese, Shelley Martel, Tony Martin, Irene Mathyssen, Mark Morrow, Sharon Murdock, Larry O'Connor, Steve Owens, Ed Philip, Gilles Pouliot, Bob Rae, Tony Silipo, Kimble Sutherland, Anne Swarbrick, Brad Ward, Shelley Wark-Martyn, Paul Wessenger, Bud Wildman, Gary Wilson, David Winninger, Jim Wiseman, Len Wood, Elaine Ziemba. *Liberals: Tim Murphy, Jean Poirier, Dianne Poole. =Nays: 68= * New Democrats: Donald Abel, Mike Cooper, Mike Farnan, Ron Hansen, Patrick Hayes, Giorgio Mammoliti, Gord Mills, Anthony Perruzza, Allan Pilkey, Tony Rizzo, Dan Waters, Fred Wilson. * Liberals: Charles Beer, Jim Bradley, Mike Brown, Bob Callahan, Elinor Caplan, Bob Chiarelli, John Cleary, Sean Conway, Joseph Cordiano, Bruce Crozier, Alvin Curling, Hans Daigeler, Ronald Eddy, Murray Elston, Joan Fawcett, Bernard Grandmaître, Jim Henderson, Monte Kwinter, Steve Mahoney, Carman McClelland, Dalton McGuinty, Lyn McLeod, Frank Miclash, Gilles Morin, Steve Offer, Hugh O'Neil, Yvonne O'Neill, Gerry Phillips, David Ramsay, Tony Ruprecht, Greg Sorbara, Barbara Sullivan. * Progressive Conservatives: Ted Arnott, Gary Carr, Don Cousens, Dianne Cunningham, Ernie Eves, Charles Harnick, Mike Harris, Chris Hodgson, Cam Jackson, Dave Johnson, Leo Jordan, Margaret Marland, Al McLean, Bill Murdoch, Bob Runciman, Norm Sterling, Chris Stockwell, David Tilson, David Turnbull, Noble Villeneuve, Jim Wilson, Elizabeth Witmer. * Independents: Peter North, John Sola. Aftereffects In the immediate moments after the bill was defeated, gay activists in the visitors' gallery of the legislature began to loudly protest and were quickly chased out of the building, in some cases violently, by Ontario Provincial Police officers. According to Toronto Sun columnist Christie Blatchford: Over the next two hours, crowds of protestors began to gather in both Toronto and Ottawa, marching through the streets in what the LGBT newspaper Xtra! would later characterize as the largest spontaneous demonstration of queer anger in the province since Operation Soap. McLeod's decision to withdraw the party's support of Bill 167 led to ongoing criticism, with activists and opposing politicians branding her as a \\"flip-flopper\\" who could not be trusted to keep a campaign promise. This, in turn, contributed significantly to the party's defeat in the 1995 election, during which some Progressive Conservative election ads depicted McLeod as a weathervane continually shifting direction with the wind. The resulting perception of untrustworthiness proved more damaging to the party's election prospects than the same-sex benefits issue itself; even Murphy, who should seemingly have been spared by his status as a champion of LGBT civil rights in the most broadly LGBT-friendly electoral district in the province, was himself defeated by PC candidate Al Leach. Similarly, the governing New Democrats were trounced in the 1995 election; although many of the MPPs who had voted in favour of the legislation were defeated, so were all 12 of the dissidents. The gay community in Ontario, additionally, held the Rae government's handling of the bill against the party for many years. In his book On the Fringe: Gays and Lesbians in Politics, political scientist David Rayside argued that both Rae and Boyd mishandled the bill by miscalculating its ability to pass on a free vote, by failing to pair it with a comprehensive public relations campaign to properly educate voters on why it was needed, and by doing little to manage the misgivings of opposing MPPs until the last minute. Even as late as 2003, Chris Phibbs, a former assistant to Toronto city councillor Kyle Rae, cited the failure of Bill 167 as her primary reason for refusing to seek the NDP endorsement in her own campaign for a city council seat in the 2003 municipal election. The bill's defeat also led to the creation of the activist group Foundation for Equal Families. Xtra! has also argued, however, that the failure of Bill 167 provided other governments with a roadmap of how not to handle controversial LGBT rights legislation, and thus ironically paved the way for future successes; just one year later in 1995, for example, the NDP government in British Columbia did successfully pass an LGBT rights bill that included adoption rights. =Subsequent legislation= Bill 5, a similar bill providing same-sex couples with equivalent statutory rights and responsibilities to opposite-sex common-law spouses under 67 provincial statutes, became law under the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris in 1999 to make changes required by the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in M v H. It included joint adoption rights.III. Adoption D. Legislative Approaches in Other Jurisdictions . \\"Ontario amended its Child and Family Services Act to allow for same-sex adoptions as part of its omnibus legislation passed in response to the Supreme Court of Canada case of M. v. H. \\" Same-sex marriage in Ontario was ultimately legalized in 2003 when the Court of Appeal for Ontario, deciding on Halpern v Canada (AG), upheld a lower court ruling which declared that defining marriage in heterosexual-only terms violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide with the passage of the federal Civil Marriage Act in 2005.

The previous attempts were at Fort Dundas, Fort Wellington and Port Essington. Escape Cliffs lies on the western coast of the Cape Hotham peninsula, and the eastern shore of Adam Bay, near the mouth and estuary of the Adelaide River. It lies about 60 km north-east of Darwin and is located in the Cape Hotham sector of the Djukbinj National Park. There is no road access, though it is sometimes visited by yachts. History In 1864, the year after South Australia was granted control over the Northern Territory, the South Australian government decided that settlement of the area was desirable and sent a surveying and settlement expedition under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Boyle Travers Finniss, a former Premier of South Australia. He had been instructed to establish the settlement at Adam Bay and chose the Escape Cliffs site despite disagreements with other members of his party. It was intended to cover settlement costs through sales of land, much of which had already been presold to speculators and intending settlers even before the expedition reached the site and began their survey work. Finniss believed that the site could produce tropical vegetation and would be suitable for wool-growing and cattle farming. After a confused start, following an abortive initial move to another site some 65 km up the Adelaide River, the establishment work at Escape Cliffs began. Problems included incursions by the local Marananggu people (which culminated in the spearing of several horses and men, murder of two Aborigines and one settler), and the unsuitability of the land due to tidal flooding and poor drainage in the wet season, exacerbated by personal jealousies, poor leadership and the need for constant vigilance, resulted in ongoing disputes and deteriorating morale. Following complaints and unfavourable reports to the South Australian government, notably by Dr. Goldsmith, Finniss was recalled in 1865, replaced by his second-in-command Manton. John McKinlay, who was sent by the government to assess the viability of Escape Cliffs or find a better site, in 1865, declared it worthless, Manton reported there was nothing they could usefully do there but guard their stores. In October 1866 Government ordered a recall of Manton and his men aboard the steamer Eagle, Captain Hill, which left 11 January 1867, transhipped to the Rangatira at Sydney, and arrived in Adelaide 2 February 1867. Two years later, following a better-organised expedition by George Goyder, settlement began at what is now Darwin. On 12 January 2000, a parcel of land at Escape Cliffs was listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register.

E. Waddell Language Academy, formerly known as Smith Academy of International Languages, is a public K-8 magnet school (elementary and middle language immersion school combined) in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School (CMS) District. All tuition takes place in the medium of the second language. The school offers language immersion in Chinese, German, French, and Japanese for kindergarten through 8th grade. Beginning Spanish in offered in middle school. The school educates 1,311 students in grades K-8. In the 2012-13 school year, 891 students were enrolled in the elementary program (K-5) and 420 in the middle school (6-8).\\"Smith Language Academy\\", Great Schools, accessed 20 January 2008\\"CMS Lottery Results\\", accessed 27 August 2012  Languages  Waddell Language Academy offers students the opportunity to become fluent and literate in a second language through second language immersion instruction in Chinese, German, French, and Japanese. From the first days in kindergarten, students are immersed in the new language. This produces students who are proficient in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in a second language. These intensive language programs are taught in the second language for all or part of the instructional day. Tracks using Chinese, French, German, or Japanese as the medium of instruction cover kindergarten through eighth grade, while the Spanish immersion track covers grades six through eight. Chinese, which the school began to offer in 2006-07, was the most recently added language. The program, in Mandarin, was first taught in kindergarten and first grade, growing a grade level each year. Students recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States in both English and their language of instruction. Immersion classes feature cultural lessons in addition to language and subject teaching. The school has effective relationships with universities in Germany and with the Visiting International Faculty program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This provides the faculty with development opportunities and resources. Overseas teachers also spend time at the school on secondment.

Waddell Language Academy.  Name  At the end of the 2010-2011 school year, Smith International Language Academy was relocated to the campus occupied by E.E. Waddell High School and given the name of E.E. Waddell, after Dr. Elbert Edwin Waddell (1922–1988). An educator and community leader, received his bachelor's and master's degrees from North Carolina A & T State University and his Doctor of Education degree from Duke University. He served as principal of Kingville High School (Albemarle, North Carolina) from 1943 to 1963. In honor of his community involvement, the original school campus was renamed E. E. Waddell Community Center. Dr. Waddell was principal of Charlotte's Second Ward High School from 1963 to 1969, when he was named Assistant to the Superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. From 1976 to 1979, he was Area Superintendent in the Harding area. In 1979, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent for Auxiliary Services, the position he held until his retirement in 1982. The former high school building was dedicated formally on Sunday, June 2, 2002.  Stadium  E.E. Waddell Language Academy Stadium is a 6,000-capacity stadium located on the grounds of E.E. Waddell Language Academy. The stadium is used for Waddell soccer, track and field, and football. It also served as the home ground for the Charlotte Eagles of the USL Second Division through the 2007 season. In 2012, West Charlotte and West Mecklenburg high schools planned to move several games to the stadium while their own stadiums underwent renovations.

This type of terrorist weapon, more commonly known as Body Cavity Bomb (BCB), is only known to have been used once, in a failed assassination attempt.  2009 attack on Prince Muhammad bin Nayef  In August 2009 Abdullah al-Asiri, the younger brother of Ibrahim al-Asiri (Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's chief bomb-maker), tried to assassinate a Saudi prince Muhammad bin Nayef with a bomb, later identified as a 'Body Cavity Bomb' (BCB). Al-Asiri absorbed most of the blast, which killed him instantly. Bin Nayef escaped with only minor injuries.  Media speculation  In May 2012, various reporters leaked their acquisition of documents describing the preparation and use of such devices. mirror According to The Daily Mirror in the UK, security officials at MI-6 asserted that female bombers could travel undetected carrying the explosive chemicals in otherwise standard breast implants. The bomber would blow up the implanted explosives by injecting a chemical trigger.  Concept  The concept of a surgically implanted improvised explosive device (SIIED) is derived from the Body Cavity Bomb (BCB) concept enunciated by Robert J. Bunker, a research associate at the Terrorism Research Center. Bunker's work for the last few years, has been on assessing the potential use of body cavity bombs (BCB) or body cavity suicide bombs (BCSB) as a variation of suicide bombing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).Robert J. Bunker. (2011) The Projected Al Qaeda Use of Body Cavity Suicide Bombs Against High Value Targets. http://www.homelandsecurity.com/2011/04/11/the-projected-al-qaeda- use-of-body-cavity-suicide-bombs-against-high-value- targets/http://www.homelandsecurity.com/category/other/originalanalysis/ The term SIIED was used in a Newsweek article in May 2012 which described it as an \\"explosive device hidden inside the body of a person in order to commit a suicide attack.\\" However, currently the United States Department of Defense Dictionary of Military Terms, only recognizes the acronym 'IED (improvised explosive device)'.http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/?zoom_query=ied&zoom;_sort=0&zoom;_per_page=10&zoom;_and=1 Bunker's 2011 report largely originated with the 2005 International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) training keys on Suicide (Homicide) Bombers: “No recorded use of cavity bombs (i.e., in the stomach, rectum, or vagina) exists, but this tactic represents a potential threat.”Bunker, R.J. (2005) Training Keys #581 & 582: Suicide (Homicide) Bombers. Alexandria, VA: International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), 2005. The author recognized early on the iterated offensive and defensive dynamic of suicide bomber and security force countermeasures and saw the offensive potentials inherent in an explosive device carried by a suicide bomber secreted inside of the human body.Bunker, R.J. Flaherty, C. (2013) Body Cavity Bombers: The NewMartyrs. A Terrorism Research Center Book. iUniverse, Inc. Bloomington, 2013. This resulted in a non-public disclosure series of presentations on projected BCB employment that took place between September 2006 and August 2008 in the United States and later in the United Kingdom. These presentations were resumed between October 2009 and February 2010 as a by-product of the first recorded use of a BCB device by Al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula in August 2009. This was the attack, on 28 August, where a suicide bomber blew himself up in Jeddah during a Ramadan gathering that included Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, head of the security services. It was the first attempt on the life of a royal since the murder of King Faisal in 1975. The prince was treated at a hospital and released. This incident was the subject of two specific studies: * Europol. (2010) The Concealment of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Rectal Cavities. SC5 - Counter Terrorism Unit. The Hague, 18 September 2010 ( EDOC#418506_v4). * Bunker, R.J. (2011) The Projected Al Qaeda Use of Body Cavity Suicide Bombs Against High Value Targets. GroupIntel Occasional Paper (March 2011). = 2010 Europol analysis = The 27 August 2009 suicide bomber attack on the Assistant Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia, Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, used a BCB type-weapon. This was an IED inserted into the bomber's rectum. Activated, once the bomber was close to the Prince Muhammad, the prince was nevertheless only ‘lightly-injured’ in this attack. The aftermath of the Nayef attack seems to confirm that the blast event is largely contained by the attacker's own body (who was later identified as al- Asiri). Europol have assessed the possible use of the BCB, and made the following findings: * It would be possible to explode a device concealed in the rectum. * Activation by radio-frequency seems to be likely. * Concealing an IED in the rectum would limit the amount of explosive available. Europol found as well—\\"should there be conclusive proof that the attack took place with an IED concealed inside the perpetrator’s body\\", it would definitely have an impact in aviation safety and the current standard operational procedures in place should be reviewed. = Tactical critiques and post-analysis = The BCB is an explosive device inserted within a human being or an animal,Bunker. R.J. (2011) The Projected Al Qaeda Use of Body Cavity Suicide Bombs Against High Value Targets. GroupIntel Occasional Paper (March 2011). with the view to hiding it from detection. It involves \\"new tactics, techniques or procedures (TTPs).\\" Concerning the BCB tactical evolution: \\"Suicide bombings (human- and vehicle-borne) have been a staple of terrorist strategy and tactics. They provide a means of low-cost precision targeting that amplifies casualties and ensures the attacks are noticed. As countermeasures (weapons screening, searches, etc.) become more effective, a shift in targeting and/or TTPs is a likely terrorist adaptation.\\" Tactically speaking, the use and employment of the BCB falls into a category of tactics known as ‘in-situ’ attacks.Flaherty, C. (2009) 2D Verses 3D Tactical Supremacy in Urban Operations. Journal of Information Warfare. (8)2: 16-24.Flaherty, C. Green, A.R. (2011) 15 Meters/11 Seconds. Journal of Information Warfare. (10)2: 22-37. The factors which could thwart the effective use of the BCB, are: * By its very nature, as a weapon it is intended for closed-in attacks (the attacker carrying the device has to be in direct contact with the target); * This is because the blast yield, has been shown to be low, to negligible. * The attacker, to be successful, has to enact an ‘in situ’ attack, physically placing their body against the target, and initiating the device. The other constraint is that this weapon likely decreases in effect if used outdoors, as indoors closed environments offer the best physical possible properties, where blast-reflection is a factor in confinement. Thus, as can be seen, the very factors that make the BCB effective are also highly limiting. = 2012–2013 post-analysis research = The 2012–2013 post-analysis research has enunciated tactical propositions that limit the effect of the BCB, and its \\"tactical use of the BCB is limited to a specific set of circumstances\\". * This is dictated by its extremely low blast capacity as a consequence of the limited yield of these weapons, namely size and concealment constraints; as well as, * The likely lack of fragmentation from ‘hard’ casings (again a consequence of the need for greater concealment). The likely employment of the BCB will be in circumstances where the attacker will attempt a one-on-one attack, specifically on an individual or object (such as an airplane's critical control system), in a ‘close-in’ attack, requiring physical contact with the victim/target. However, \\"the BCB may also ultimately develop into a purely terror, or a ‘protest horror’ weapon; the impact of which has less to do with its overall effectiveness, and more to do with its grotesqueness—a weapon designed to invite horror and revulsion.\\" = Airport security scanning methods = A summary of body scanning techniques for airport security reveals that the BCB can evade most of the commonly used sensor strategies. For instance, the current operational methods are: * Metal Detector: The detectability of a BCB is subject to the sensitivity of the detector and metal content of the BCB. High sensitivity leads to high false alarm rates, making detection problematic. Security personnel need to be aware of the BCB threat, in order to interpret the signal from a handheld metal detector correctly. * Millimeter Wave Scanner, or ‘mmW-scanner’: These are unable to penetrate skin, and cannot detect a BCB. They could eventually detect a device used to ignite a BCB, if interpreted correctly. * X-ray Transmission Scanners: These have a very high detection probability. However, the scan is carcinogenic, therefore it is not being used in airport security. These machines exist in some U.S. prisons and proved their capability to detect objects hidden in body cavities. * Puffer machine (explosives trace detection machine): This could detect explosives in rectal, vaginal, and oral cavities, but not implanted explosives. It can detect traces of explosives, if the carrier has been in contact with them before implantation. At least two different detection mechanisms exist: (i) ion mobility spectrometry and (ii) mass spectrometry. * Backscatter X-ray: This gives a much lower radiation dose than transmission scanners and penetrates skin slightly but not sufficiently to detect a BCB reliably. Possible health effects are still being debated. = Future detection strategies = In the case of sensor strategies under development, such as the Radiometric Scanner, these are unable to penetrate skin and cannot detect a BCB. These could eventually detect a device used to ignite one, if interpreted correctly. Several other methods can also be considered and for example include: * Thermal Scanner (passive infrared): The BCB would most likely obstruct heat transfer to the body surface and could therefore be detected by a thermal scanner. However, for some reason, this technique does not seem to be discussed for airport security screening, but is only applied in medical imaging. * Active Infrared Scanner: Currently under development as a stand-off scanner for U.S. Police, it is unable to penetrate skin, and cannot detect a BCB. * Ultrasonography: This would detect a BCB with very high probability. However, it is too time-consuming for a primary scan. Therefore, it is only used in medical imaging. * Magnetic Resonance Tomography: Would detect a BCB with very high probability. High magnetic fields would dislocate or even pull out iron parts of the BCB or painfully heat up any other metal. The same holds true for any other metallic implant. Even more time-consuming than ultrasonography, it is therefore, only used in medical imaging.  Canine detection Dogs may be able to detect explosives in rectal, vaginal, or oral cavities, but not implanted explosives. Dogs can also detect traces of explosives if the person has been in contact with them before implantation. However, they are subject to exhaustion. Additionally, issues exist concerning canine training procedures, as most bomb dogs are trained to ‘alert’ on items and not on individuals for detecting explosive material residues.  Physical detection Physical examinations can detect a BCB with a medium-high probability. In practical terms, this is time-consuming for a primary scan. This method is more than likely to be challenged by privacy groups, in particular, the issue of violation of a potentially pregnant woman.  Future technology detection capacity  It has also been speculated that there appears to be a partial overlap between mm wave radar and terahertz radar. Some of the public source information suggests that there are some possibilities for terahertz radar, which lies between mm wave radar and long infra-red in the electromagnetic spectrum. Namely, there is at least some penetration with terahertz radar as it is used for thickness and density measurement and biomedical scanning, and is suggested for detecting weapons under clothing. It can detect specific chemicals, including explosives, in vapour phase by the adsorption spectra. This should be able to detect explosives vapours inside a sealed package, provided there is some air void in the package when sealed. Some prototypes for area security scanning have been tested in the field, but the results as not publicly known. The capabilities appear to be better than given for mm wave radar. Ideally, a fully developed terahertz radar system might have the sensitivity of ultrasonic scanning, positive identification of explosives chemicals, and non- contact scanning as well as reducing the inconvenience to travellers. However, such a development may be far in the future. =Factors affecting surgically implanted device deployment= The BCB primarily involves a device inserted into a body opening. As well, the idea of creating a surgically implanted IED (improvised explosive device), placed within a body, with the explosives detonated by injecting a chemical trigger, has been frequently discussed in news reporting, including media claims, that such a medical procedure to place a BCB inside a person or an animal, has been perfected. However, this possibility has been extensively reviewed in research literature on terrorism TTPs, which has concluded, that while this may give a much higher blast yield capability; such a procedure nevertheless: * Involves a complex medical procedure (which may not be successful). * Likely need for recuperation time (weeks in some cases, in particular time to allow surgical scarring to fade). * Requires highly developed medical facilities, including a substantial medico-logistical support capability. * High likelihood of the patient dying, as a result of the procedure. * As well, medical complications where the container to hold everything together, as well as provide a barrier to the carrier's body from the toxic exposure to the explosives used, breaches.  In popular culture  The BCB has a long history in science fiction writing and film history. For example, in the 1957 novella \\"Run for the Stars\\" by Harlan Ellison, the drug-addicted protagonist has a bomb implanted in his abdomen to delay an advancing alien army, making him an involuntary suicide bomber. Notwithstanding, in conventional security thinking, it has been noted that \\"placing bombs inside live human beings was still definitely not on the radar\\" prior to 2009. The concept of the BCB has been regularly used as a theatrical–plot device in many popular TV shows and movies since at least the late 1960s (and perhaps earlier), and a number of popular U.S. films and television series episodes have featured the BCB, \\"ironically illustrating many of the key tactical concepts herein—that is, it is hidden in the human body, camouflaged from intelligence sensors, and used for attacks on specific targets\\". For example: * The U.S. film, Death Race 2000, a 1975 cult action film, in which one of the characters called ‘Frankenstein’ intends to assassinate the president by planning to shake his hand, detonating a grenade which has been implanted in the perpetrator's prosthetic right hand (who calls it his ‘hand grenade’). * The 1990 science fiction television episode ‘Reunion’—the 81st in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (original air date of 5 November 1990)—features a BCB, used in an attempted assassination. The plot involves a dramatized discovery by medical staff that one of those killed after the detonation of the bomb actually had a powerful micro explosive hidden in his arm, sufficiently powerful to kill another person present in the room at the time of the explosion. The elements of the plot involved a BCB hidden and undetected (from security sensors) inside a person's arm, requiring them to stand close to their intended target. * The 2001 U.S. science fiction movie Impostor, based on the 1953 short story Impostor by Philip K. Dick, features the use of BCBs. Set in the year 2079, the film's plot revolves around human 'replicants', created by hostile aliens, which are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories. This allows the 'replicants' to approach their targets camouflaged from detection. Each has a small, organic nuclear bomb in place of a heart, programmed to detonate when they are in proximity to their target. * The British television series Spooks features in its season 3 finale a woman carrying a chemical BCB in an attempt to murder the prime minister, the bomb contained in her stomach to avoid discovery. * Denzel Washington's 2004 movie Man on Fire from features a BCB used to torture a victim. Washington plays a character who, in one particular scene, traps a corrupt police officer (Fuentes), and rectally inserts a five- minute timed bomb into him while he is restrained face down. This is done to terrorize Fuentes into giving information. After he gets this information, the protagonist walks away and leaves the bomb inside Fuentes to detonate. * The 2008 Batman film, The Dark Knight, also featured a BCB.

In each episode, celebrities are presented with a \\"book of life\\" that is compiled with information researched by professional genealogists that allows them to view their ancestral histories, learn about familial connections and discover secrets about their lineage. Season Six is shown from October 2019 to October 2020 with two new episodes airing weekly in October 2019, eight episodes airing weekly in January and February 2020 and six episodes airing weekly in October and November 2020. All episodes air on Tuesdays.https://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/watch/tv-schedule Premise The series uses traditional genealogical research and genetics to discover the family history of well-known Americans. Genetic techniques include Y-chromosome DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and autosomal DNA analyses to infer both ancient and recent genetic relationships. The series has examined the family histories of celebrity guests with African American, Asian American, British American, Chinese American, Dutch American, Greek American, Indian American, Irish American, Italian American, Jewish American, and Latin American heritage. Each celebrity guest is given a book of life which contains all the information discovered about the guest's genealogy by researchers. Included in or within the book are comprehensive genetic results, a family tree that is as complete as paper research allows, copies of historical records used to assemble each tree, and photos of newly found family members. In some episodes, particularly episodes in which original DNA profiling research must be used to establish a past ancestor's parental link, guests are reunited with long-lost relatives. However, in most episodes, each guest is predominantly shown seated opposite Gates as he guides them through their book of life. To show correlations between the guests' family stories, each episode cuts back and forth between two or three guest stories. To draw further correlations, Gates uses examples from his own genealogy quite frequently. Examples of this would be a grandmother of his having multiple children with a white man whose name she never revealed, as well as Gates' membership into the Sons of the American Revolution. In addition to celebrity guests, everyday people are sometimes featured in an episode to create a third or fourth story line. Usually the non-celebrity guests are a group of peers. One example of this would be the episode in which Gates has his friends at his local barbershop take a DNA test to determine their ethnic makeup, each friend betting on their percentages of African, European, and Native American genetic heritage. Another episode uses a similar guessing game with students at a local school. Singular secondary guests include Robert Downey Sr. and Margarett Cooper, the latter being a friend of Gates'. Episodes Production =Background= The series has seen two past incarnations on PBS, both of which were hosted by Henry Louis Gates Jr. In 2006 and 2008, the series African American Lives aired. Both seasons of the series consisted of a season-long story line as well as an all African American cast. In 2010 Faces of America aired. Though it continued to use the season-long plot from the prior installment, it was the first installment to be hosted by Gates which included Americans of all ethnic and racial backgrounds. Starting with Finding Your Roots in 2012, the series changed from a season-long plot to having plots extending only within a single episode. In doing so, it has allowed the series to extend its number of episodes each season to ten, opposed to the prior four episodes a season. =Ben Affleck controversy= The show's third season was postponed by WNET after it was discovered that actor Ben Affleck had persuaded Gates to omit information about his slave-owning ancestors. The series returned on January 5, 2016, although \\"Roots of Freedom\\", the second-season episode featuring Affleck, was pulled from all forms of distribution by PBS. PBS America, a U.K. TV channel featuring content from PBS in the U.S., continues to feature three clips from the withdrawn episode on their YouTube channel.

It is one of his military comic book derivatives and was one of the works presented at his first solo exhibition. The work is in the collection at the Yale University Art Gallery History The source for Blam was All American Men of War #89 (January–February 1962) The painting is based on Russ Heath's art in the comic book All-American Men of War issue #89 (January-February 1962), published by National Periodical Publications. The painting depicts a pilot ejecting from an exploding plane. The same issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata, Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at The Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Blam sold for $1000 ($ in dollars), according to one source, but less than $1000 according to another. The exhibition included Look Mickey, Engagement Ring and The Refrigerator. The show ran from February 10 through March 3. The work appeared in the exhibition entitled 'The New Realists' at the Sidney Janis Gallery from November 1 to December 1, 1962. Details Lichtenstein in 1967 Lichtenstein began his war imagery efforts with single frame pictures such as BLAM. Blam uses quintessential war imagery. Although the text is limited to one four- letter word, the narrative is unnecessary owing to the eminent realism presented. The canvas is loaded with images surrounding the focal figure, of the aircraft under attack. It is regarded, along with Takka Takka as \\"successful in their combination of brilliant color and narrative situation\\". Blam is a jest with the viewer that uses an exclamation without narrative context. Like Blang (1962) and Varoom (1963), Blam's onomatopoeia explodes \\"like a violent central sun over the entire composition\\". Lichtenstein has revised the original source so that the aircraft and its explosion are the joint foci from which the painting radiates. Unlike the original, which had substantive narrative content, Lichtenstein's version has more formality and a linear pattern, but a more simplified surface.
