His father was a poor farmer. Even when he was a student at high school he started to work part-time to support his parents. But he had a strong desire to gain higher education and despite several hardships managed to graduate in Economics from Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur. He was later appointed as a faculty member in the same university. In 1969, under Fulbright Program, he went to study at Arizona University, USA. During his career as a university teacher he taught at several institutions in India and abroad which included Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, University of Nairobi, Kenya and Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad.reference 1,2,3 Throughout his career he worked on many research projects in Economics.reference 1,2,3,4,5 His second life started after retirement at the age of 60 in 1999. Just before retirement, he started to teach on part-time basis at newly started Aravali Institute of Management at Jodhpur in the year 2000, where he was highly respected. He was proud and delighted to learn that the quality of higher education had started to improve in Rajasthan and private sector was also making its own contribution. He then got appointed at another newly established National Law University, Jodhpur, where he was loved and respected by colleagues and students. Later he was granted emeritus professorship from University Grants Commission and was working on a project named Money Cycle in India.reference 5 His life was full of struggle but he had a strong desire to live his life in a meaningful way. Apart from teaching he also took an active part in reforming the society. He voiced strong concerns against widely popular culture of \\"feasts on death\\"(locally known as Mrityu Bhoj). Despite being born in a Brahmin family he was against caste system in India which divides our society in upper and lower castes. He was often sad that in his lifetime he couldn't see elimination of caste system from our society. He was taken ill in 1996 and doctors predicted his life of few weeks. But he rose again and was back to work within a year and never stopped. In Jan. 2010 he was appointed a faculty at Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur where he delivered last lecture of his life. He was taken ill again and developed severe Pneumonia. He was put on Ventilator support and his life was predicted of a few days. Once again proving all predictions wrong he recovered. But unfortunately his heart became weak and he developed severe heart failure. He was served by equally devoted wife Mrs.Shanti Sharma who looked after him while he was home bound. Throughout his life he never charged any tuition fee from students whom he taught at home. His own room at home was like a classroom where he was surrounded by students .Teaching was his passion and service to the humanity. On 20 October 2012 he died sitting next to his wife at home. He was a simple soul who started his journey from a small village and made it to several prestigious institutes in India and abroad. He truly lived a meaningful life aimed at improving quality of life of his fellow countrymen. He never received any Prize or glorification from any government or non government bodies. The respect he earned from his students, colleagues and peers was more than any medal or prize. His contribution to education especially in Economics was enormous. He was a true son of Rajasthan. His family members have taken initiative to start Professor Ram Lal Sharma education trust to help improve level of education in the Western Rajasthan. References 1\\\\.

Foucault received praise from several scholars. Summary Merquior provides a largely negative evaluation of Foucault's work. He argues that Foucault's works are often riddled with major errors of fact and reasoning that undermine Foucault's arguments. Merquior notes, for example, that in Foucault's first major book, Madness and Civilization (1961), he argued that in Europe before the Enlightenment madness was relegated to the fringes of society but nonetheless seen as a type of divine wisdom engaged in dialogue with, and pointing out the foibles of, society. However, Merquior suggests that the historical record contradicts Foucault by showing that the insane were often imprisoned and treated cruelly long before the Enlightenment; that English philanthropist William Tuke and French physician Philippe Pinel did not \\"‚Äòinvent‚Äô mental illness\\" as Foucault contended but rather built on the work of predecessors; and furthermore the motives for creating insane asylums across Europe was nowhere near as uniform as Foucault implies. He writes that, \\"Foucault‚Äôs epochal monoliths crumble before the contradictory wealth of the historical evidence.\\" He compares Madness and Civilization to Norman O. Brown's Life Against Death (1959), describing them as similar calls \\"for the liberation of the Dionysian id.\\" Discussing The History of Sexuality (1976), Merquior writes that Foucault's views about sexual repression are preferable to those of Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse, and their followers, in that they have \\"the advantage of descriptive, if not explanatory, realism\\", and that Foucault is supported by \\"the latest historiographic research on bourgeois sex\\". He considers the book's second two volumes to be of higher scholarly quality than the first, and finds Foucault to be \\"original and insightful\\" in his discussion of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and other Stoics in The Care of the Self. However, he notes that the details of Foucault's views are open to question, and suggests that Foucault's discussion of Greek pederasty is less illuminating than that of Kenneth Dover, despite Foucault's references to Dover's Greek Homosexuality (1978). In conclusion, he suggests that Foucault's widespread influence in the academic humanities is attributable less to the quality of Foucault's work and more to his fashionable quasi-Marxist habit of \\"bourgeoisie-bashing\\".Merquior 1991. pp. 29, 33, 121-2, 132, 135-6, 159. Merquior does offer other scattered praise for Foucault's work, describing his early efforts at literary criticism as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"insightful\\", and applauding his use of obscure historical sources and documents to shed new light on neglected areas of inquiry.Merquior 1991. pp. 86, 164. Publication history Foucault was first published by Fontana Press, an imprint of HarperCollins, in 1985. A second edition was published in 1991. The book is part of the Fontana Modern Masters series.Merquior 1991. p. 4. Reception Colin Gordon reviewed Foucault in The Times Literary Supplement.Gordon 1986. p. 626. Alan Swingewood gave the book a positive review in the British Journal of Sociology, calling it \\"elegant and well-informed\\". Swingewood endorsed many of Merquior's criticisms of Foucault, and wrote that Merquior was perhaps correct to conclude that Foucault \\"embraces nihilism.\\"Swingewood 1987. p. 294. Merquior's work was praised by the critics Roger KimballKimball 1993. and Camille Paglia, who both suggested that it shows that Foucault made elementary errors in every area he wrote about; Paglia called Merquior's expos√© hilarious. Though supportive of Foucault in general, Paglia criticized Merquior for failing to discuss what she saw as Foucault's enormous debts to French sociologist √âmile Durkheim.Paglia 1993. p. 224. The literature professor John M. Ellis called Foucault the best general account of Foucault's oeuvre,Ellis 1997. pp. 246-247. while Gregory R. Johnson called it one of Merquior's \\"minor classics.\\"Johnson 1992. p. 154. Conversely, Paul Bov√© dismissed Merquior's criticisms of Foucault as arrogant and stupid.Bov√© 1990. pp. viii, xxxvi.

It is one of the lesser-traveled highways in the state and is not part of the National Highway System. It is a two-lane road for its entire length. K-34 was originally designated in southeastern Kansas, running through Neodesha. The designation was moved to southwestern Kansas in 1937, replacing the old K-41 designation. The highway formerly ran to the Oklahoma border via a concurrency with US-183. The designation was shortened in 1993 to its current routing. Route description K-34 begins at an intersection with US-160 and US-183 east of Ashland in Clark County. It heads north through rolling farmland along a two- lane road. A series of curves takes the highway northeast, after which the route straightens out to the north and crosses Bluff Creek before intersecting a road which, prior to 1965, carried K-34. It continues due north and enters Ford County. North of the county line and south of Bucklin, K-34 takes the name 132 Road. The route turns to the northwest as it crosses Day Road and enters the city of Bucklin. After entering the city, K-34 curves to the north and becomes Main Street. In the northern portion of Bucklin, the route turns southwest and overlaps U.S. Route 54 for a short distance. Following the short concurrency, K-34 turns to the north and passes under a railroad operated by Union Pacific. The highway twists to the northwest and leaves Bucklin, meeting its northern terminus a few miles farther to the northwest at an intersection with US-400. K-34 is maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). The route's annual average daily traffic in 2012 was about 570 vehicles, including 240 trucks, south of Bucklin. North of the city, there was significantly more traffic. There were 1010 vehicles, and 285 trucks, from Bucklin to the highway's northern terminus. No segment of the highway is part of the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. History K-34 was first designated before 1932 in Wilson and Montgomery counties. That route began at K-96 and ran east to K-16. Around 1936, another segment of the route was designated in Cherokee County, east of the rest of the route, from Crestline to the Missouri state line. In 1937, the portion of the western segment of the route located west of US-75 was re-designated as K-37, the eastern segment of the route was renumbered as K-26, and K-34 was re-designated in the southwestern portion of the state from the Oklahoma state line to its current northern terminus. The segment of the highway north of US-160 replaced the former K-41 designation. At the time of its designation, not all of K-34 was paved. The segment in Ford County and the concurrency with US-160 was paved, but all other segments were either gravel or dirt. By 1948, all of the route was paved except a small portion in Comanche and Clark counties, which was still gravel. No dirt segments remained by 1948. K-334 was proposed in 1964, as a connector road from K-34, US-160 and US-183 north to K-34. In 1965, K-334 was cancelled and instead became a new alignment of K-34, which was realigned to extended straight north from the intersection with US-160 and US-183 instead of overlapping those highways and traveling east. This realignment caused the route to bypass Comanche County entirely, and by 1967, the whole highway was paved. In 1993, the concurrency with US-183 was removed from the route. The route has not been modified since 1993.

His family had inherited the manor of Sydenham by marriage to the heiress of the prominent Westcountry Sydenham family, which had originated there,Collinson, Rev.

He was born at Nailsea Court. Career He was educated at St Paul's School, London. As a law student at Lincoln's Inn, he alienated his father by extravagance, and by marrying Joan Young, seventh daughter of Henry Young of Buckhorn Weston in Dorset who brought him no fortune. Perceval went into Spain, and lived there four years till his wife's death; he then returned to England, and vainly sought reconciliation with his father. Through his friend Roger Cave of Stamford, who had married Lord Burghley's sister Margaret, he was introduced to the lord treasurer. The queen rewarded him with a pension, and later with a place in the Duchy of Lancaster; and Burghley, when his son Robert Cecil became master of the court of wards, made him \\"secretary\\" of the court. Success won back for Perceval his father's favour, and he inherited a substantial income from property. At the end of the queen's reign he was sent to Ireland to see if the court of wards could be extended there with profit to the crown; but his report was unfavourable. In 1603‚Äì4 he sat in parliament for Richmond in Yorkshire, and took some part in commercial matters of trade and revenue, and in the business of the union with Scotland. In 1610, on Sir William Fleetwood's disgrace as receiver-general of the court of wards, the office was vested in commissioners, of whom Perceval was one. On the death of his patron Cecil, earl of Salisbury, on 24 May 1612, Perceval lost all his posts in England; but on a new settlement of the court of wards being projected in Ireland, he was made registrar or clerk of the court in 1616. He now sold a major part of his patrimony, and invested in purchases and mortgages in County Cork. In 1618 he returned to England to secure his appointment against the claims of a competitor, and, though obliged to resign part of his salary, he saved his post and obtained a discharge of all his debts to the crown. In 1609 Perceval was on the list of members of the Virginia Company, incorporated on 23 May of that year, and in 1610 he was a donor to the supply of the plantation begun in Virginia.

Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of county governments, such as the Government of San Joaquin County. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. The County government is composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices including the Sheriff, District Attorney, and Assessor, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Administrator. Some chartered cities such as Stockton and Tracy provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Some other cities arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with San Joaquin County, such as the San Joaquin County Superior Court.  Organization   Board of Supervisors  The five-member elected San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors (BOS) is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process. As of January 2019, the members of the San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors are: * Miguel Villapudua (District 1 and Chair), * Katherine Miller (District 2), * Tom Patti (District 3), * Charles Winn (District 4), * Bob Elliott (District 5).  Elected officers  In addition to the Board of Supervisors, there are several elected officers that form the Government of San Joaquin County that are required by the California Constitution and California law. The San Joaquin County Sheriff provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of the county, serving as the equivalent of the county police for unincorporated areas of the county, as well as incorporated cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as \\"contract cities\\"). The San Joaquin County District Attorney prosecutes felony and misdemeanor crimes that occur within the jurisdiction of San Joaquin County. The San Joaquin County Assessor is the office which deals with the tax-side to property in the county.  Other departments  The Human Services Agency (HSA) administers multiple California welfare programs within the county, such as Medi-Cal (Medicaid), CalFresh (food stamps), CalWORKs (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), a Medically Indigent Service Program (MISP), and a Low Income Health Program (Obamacare).  Law  The San Joaquin County Ordinance Code is the codified law of the County in the form of ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors. Every act prohibited or declared unlawful, and every failure to perform an act required, by the ordinances are misdemeanor crimes, unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code ¬ß 25132.  Other governments   California  The San Joaquin Superior Court, which covers the entire county, is not a County department but a division of the State's trial court system. Historically, the courthouses were county-owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades. In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses). Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state.

The award is handed at a ceremony arranged by the publishing house which has published the winning book and by the Committee De Gyldne Laurb√¶r. Early in January every year the committee sends out ballot to all the Danish bookshops, which then give their vote for a Danish book which was published the year before. An author can only win The Golden Laurel once-in-a-lifetime, so the bookshops can not vote for an author who has already won the prize once before.

Part of this process requires that children come to realize that others‚Äô views may differ from their own. Role-taking ability involves understanding the cognitive and affective (i.e. relating to moods, emotions, and attitudes) aspects of another person's point of view, and differs from perceptual perspective taking, which is the ability to recognize another person's visual point of view of the environment. Furthermore, albeit some mixed evidence on the issue, role taking and perceptual perspective taking seem to be functionally and developmentally independent of each other. Robert Selman is noted for emphasizing the importance of this theory within the field of cognitive development. He argues that a matured role-taking ability allows us to better appreciate how our actions will affect others, and if we fail to develop the ability to role take, we will be forced to erroneously judge that others are behaving solely as a result of external factors. One of Selman's principal additions to the theory has been an empirically supported developmental theory of role-taking ability. Social cognitive research on children's thoughts about others‚Äô perspectives, feelings, and behaviors has emerged as one of the largest areas of research in the field. Role-taking theory can provide a theoretical foundation upon which this research can rest and be guided by and has relations and applications to numerous other theories and topics. Selman's developmental theory Robert Selman developed his developmental theory of role-taking ability based on four sources. The first is the work of M. H. Feffer (1959, 1971), and Feffer and Gourevitch (1960), which related role-taking ability to Piaget's theory of social decentering, and developed a projective test to assess children's ability to decenter as they mature. The second is the research of John H. Flavell (1968),Flavell, John H., et al. 1968. The development of role-taking and communication skills in children. New York: John Wiley & Sons. . ERIC ID:ED027082. which studied children's growing abilities to judge other people's conceptual and perceptual perspectives. The third is the developmental ideas of differentiation, whereupon one learns to distinguish his/her perspective from the perspectives of others, and integration, the ability to relate one's perspective to the perspectives of others. The final source of influence comes from Selman's own previous research where he assessed children's ability to describe the different perspectives of characters in a story. One example of Selman's stories is that of Holly and her father. Children are told about Holly, an avid 8-year-old tree climber. One day, Holly falls off a tree, but does not hurt herself. Holly's father sees this and makes Holly promise that she will stop climbing trees, and Holly promises. Later, however, Holly and her friends meet Shawn, a boy whose kitten is stuck in a tree. Holly is the only one amongst her friends who can climb trees well enough to save Shawn's kitten, who may fall at any moment, but she remembers the promise she made with her father. Selman then goes on to ask children about the perspectives of Holly and her father, and each stage is associated with typical responses. Stages = Level 0: Egocentric Role Taking = Level 0 (ages 3‚Äì6, roughly) is characterized by two lacking abilities. The first is the failure to distinguish perspectives (differentiation). More specifically, the child is unable to distinguish between his perspective, including his perspective on why a social action occurred, and that of others. The second ability the child lacks is relating perspectives (social integration). In the Holly dilemma, children tend to respond that Holly will save the kitten and that the father will not mind Holly's disobedience because he will be happy and he likes kittens. In actuality, the child is displaying his/her inability to separate his/her liking for kittens from the perspectives of Holly and her father. = Level 1: Subjective role taking = At level 1 (ages 6‚Äì8, roughly), children now recognize that they and others in a situation may have different information available to them, and thus may differ in their views. In other words, children have matured in differentiation. The child still significantly lacks integration ability, however: he/she cannot understand that his views are influenced by the views of others, and vice versa, ad infinitum. In addition, the child believes that the sole reason for differing social perspectives is because of different information, and nothing else. In the Holly dilemma, when asked if the father would be angry if he found out that Holly climbed the tree again, children might respond, ‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt know why she climbed the tree, he would be angry. But if he knew why she did it, he would realize that she had a good reason,‚Äù not recognizing that the father may still be angry, regardless of her wanting to save the kitten, because of his own values, such as his concern for his daughter's safety. = Level 2: Self- reflective role taking = The child's differentiation ability matures at this level (ages 8‚Äì10, roughly) enough so that he/she understands that people can also differ in their social perspectives because of their particularly held and differing values and set of purposes. In turn, the child is able to better put him/herself in the position of another person. In terms of integration, the child can now understand that others think about his/her point of view too. This allows the child to predict how the other person might react to the child's behaviour. What is still lacking, however, is for the child to be able to consider another person's point of view and another person's point of view of the child simultaneously. In the Holly dilemma, when children are asked if Holly will climb the tree, they will typically respond, ‚ÄúYes. She knows that her father will understand why she did it.‚Äù This indicates the child is considering the father's perspective in light of Holly's perspective; however, when asked if the father would want Holly to climb the tree, children typically respond that he would not. This shows that the child is solely considering the father's point of view and his worry for Holly's safety. = Level 3: Mutual role taking = In level 3 (ages 10‚Äì12, roughly), the child can now differentiate his/her own perspective from the viewpoint likely for the average member of the group. In addition, the child can take the view of a detached third-person and view a situation from that perspective. In terms of integration, the child can now simultaneously consider his/her view of others and others‚Äô view of the child, and the consequences of this feedback loop of perspectives in terms of behaviour and cognition. In describing the result of the Holly dilemma, the child may take the perceptive of a detached third party, responding that ‚ÄúHolly wanted to get the kitten because she likes kittens, but she knew that she wasn‚Äôt supposed to climb trees. Holly‚Äôs father knew that Holly had been told not to climb trees, but he couldn‚Äôt have known about [the kitten].‚Äù = Level 4: Societal role taking = At level 4 (ages 12‚Äì15+, roughly), the adolescent now considers others‚Äô perspectives with reference to the social environment and culture the other person comes from, assuming that the other person will believe and act in accord to their society's norms and values. When asked if Holly deserves to be punished for her transgression, adolescents typically respond that Holly should not as her father should understand that we need to humanely treat animals. Evidence for Selman's Stages Three studies have been conducted to assess Selman's theory, all of which having shown support for his developmental outline of role-taking ability progression. Selman conducted the first study of his own theory using 60 middle-class children from ages 4 to 6. In this experiment, the children were asked to predict and explain their predictions about another child's behaviour in a certain situation. The child participants were given situational information not available to the child they were making behavioural and cognitive predictions about. Results implied a stage progression of role taking ability as a function of age, as theorized by Selman. In a second assessment of the theory, Selman and D. F. Byrne interviewed 40 children, ages 4, 6, 8, and 10, on two socio-moral dilemmas. Children were required to discuss the perspectives of different characters in each dilemma, and results again showed that role taking ability progressed through stages as a function of age. The third study assessing Selman's theory was a 5-year longitudinal study of 41 male children on their role taking ability. Results showed that 40 of the 41 children interviewed followed the stages as outlined by Selman and none skipped over a stage. Relation to other topics Piaget's theory of cognitive development Jean Piaget stressed the importance of play in children, especially play that involves role taking. He believed that role taking play in children promotes a more mature social understanding by teaching children to take on the roles of others, allowing them to understand that different people can have differing perspectives. In addition, Piaget argued that good solutions to interpersonal conflicts involve compromise which arises out of our ability to consider the points of view of others. Two of Piaget's fundamental concepts have primarily influenced role taking theory: # egocentrism, the mode of thinking that characterizes preoperational thinking, which is the child's failure to consider the world from other points of view. # decentration, the mode of thinking that characterizes operational thinking, which is the child's growing ability to perceive the world with more than one perspective in mind. In Piagetian theory, these concepts were used to describe solely cognitive development, but they have been applied in role taking theory to the social domain. Evidence that Piaget's cognitive theories can be applied to the interpersonal aspects of role-taking theory comes from two sources. The first is empirical evidence that children's ability to role take is correlated to their IQ and performance on Piagetian tests. Secondly, the two theories have been conceptually linked in that Selman's role-taking stages correspond to Piaget's cognitive development stages, where preoperational children are at level 1 or 2, concrete operators are at level 3 or 4, and formal operators are at level 4 or 5 of Selman's stages. Given this relation, M. H. Feffer, as well as Feffer and V. Gourevitch, have argued that social role-taking is an extension of decentering in the social sphere. Selman has argued this same point, also noting that the growth of role-taking ability is brought on by the child's decreased egocentrism as he/she ages. Kohlberg's stages of moral development Lawrence Kohlberg argued that higher moral development requires role-taking ability. For instance, Kohlberg's conventional level of morality (between ages 9 and 13, roughly), involves moral stereotyping, empathy-based morality, alertness to and behaviour guided by predicted evaluations by others, and identifying with authority, all of which require role taking. Selman tested 60 children, ages 8 to 10, on Kohlberg's moral-judgment measure and two role-taking tasks. He found that the development of role taking, within this age range, related to the progression into Kohlberg's conventional moral stage. A retest a year later confirmed Kohlberg's argument, and in general, it was shown that higher moral development at the conventional stage requires children's achieved ability at this age to reciprocally deal with their own and others‚Äô perspectives. Mason and Gibbs (1993) found that moral judgment development, as measured by Kohlberg's theory, consistently related to role taking opportunities experienced after childhood in adolescence and adulthood. This finding supported Kohlberg's view that moral progress beyond his third stage necessitates contact with other perspectives, namely those of entire cultures or political groups, which individuals are likely to encounter as they become adolescents and adults and thus meet many different people in school and the workplace. Relation between Kohlberg‚Äôs stages, Piaget‚Äôs theory, and Selman‚Äôs theory Kohlberg and Piaget both emphasized that role taking ability facilitates moral development. Kohlberg argued that cognitive and role-taking development are required but not sufficient for moral development. In turn, he maintained that Piaget's cognitive developmental stages underlie Selman's role taking stages, which are subsequently fundamental to his own moral developmental stages. This predicts that cognition develops first, followed by the corresponding role taking stage, and finally the corresponding moral stage, and never the other way around. Conceptually, the three processes have been tied together by Walker (1980). His reasoning is that cognitive development involves the progressive understanding of the environment as it is. Role-taking is a step upon this, which is the recognition that people each have their own subjective interpretation of the environment, including how they think about and behave towards other people. Moral development, the final step, is the grasping of how people should think and behave towards one another. Evidence in support of this view comes first from three reviews which showed moderate correlations between Selman's role taking theory, Piaget's cognitive developmental stages, and Kohlberg's moral developmental stages. More evidence comes from Walker and Richards' (1979) finding that moral development to Kohlberg's stage 4 occurred only for those who already had early basic formal operations according to Piaget's developmental theory, and not for those in an earlier stage. Similarly, Paolitto's attempts to stimulate moral development worked only for subjects who already attained the corresponding role taking stage. Previous research has also shown that short role taking treatments, such as exposing subjects to the role taking reasoning of subjects in one stage higher, can lead to moral development. In more general demonstrations of this argument, Faust and Arbuthnot and other researchers have shown that moral development is most probable for subjects with higher cognitive development. In a direct investigation of Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument, Walker tested the hypothesis that only children who had attained both beginning formal operations and role taking stage 3 could progress to Kohlberg's moral stage 3. 146 grade 4-7 children participated in this study, and the results strongly supported the hypothesis, given that only children who had the beginning formal substage of cognitive development and role taking stage 3 progressed to moral stage 3. Further support came from the study's demonstration that a short role playing treatment stimulated progress in moral reasoning in a 6-week follow-up retest. Krebs and Gilmore also directly tested Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument of moral development in 51 children, ages 5‚Äì14, for the first three stages of cognitive, role taking, and moral development. Results generally supported Kohlberg's view, but not as strongly, given that it was only demonstrated that cognitive development is a prerequisite for role taking development, and not for moral development. Based on these results, researchers have suggested that moral education programs underlain by Kohlberg's theory must first ensure that the prerequisite cognitive and role taking abilities have developed. Prosocial behavior Role-taking ability has been argued to be related to prosocial behaviours and feelings. Evidence for this claim has been found from many sources. Underwood and Moore (1982), for instance, have found that perceptual, affective, and cognitive perspective-taking are positively correlated with prosocial behaviour. Children trained to improve their role-taking ability subsequently become more generous, more cooperative, and more apprehensive to the needs of others in comparison to children who received no role taking training. Research has also shown that people who are good at role-taking have greater ability to sympathize with others. Overall, the picture is clear: prosocial behaviour is related to role taking ability development and social deviance is linked to egocentrism. To study one reason for the link between role-taking ability and prosociality, second-grade children found to be either high or low in role-taking were instructed to teach two kindergartners on an arts and crafts task. Sixteen measures of prosocial behaviour were scored, and high and low role takers diverged on 8 of the measures, including several helping measures, providing options, and social problem solving. Analysis of the results showed that low role takers helped less than high role takers not because of a lack of wanting to help, but because of their poorer ability in interpreting social cues indicating the need for help. In other words, low role takers tended to only be able to recognize problems when they were made plainly obvious. Role taking has also been related to empathy. Batson had participants listen to an interview of a woman going through hardship. He then instructed participants to imagine how she feels, or, to imagine how they would feel in her situation, and found that both conditions produced feelings of empathy. Schoenrade has found the same result, where imagining how a person in distress feels or how one would feel in that person's situation produces feelings of empathy. Finally, many theorists, including Mead, Piaget, Asch, Heider, Deutsch, Madsen, and Kohlberg have theorized a relationship between cooperation and role taking ability. In one study, children's predisposition to cooperate was shown to strongly correlate with their affective role taking ability. Other researchers have also shown an indirect relationship between cooperation and role-taking capacity. Social functioning A child's ability to function in social relationships has been found to depend partially on his/her role-taking ability. For instance, researchers found that children poor in role-taking ability had greater difficulty in forming and sustaining social relationships, as well as receiving lower peer nominations. Davis (1983) found that role-taking ability was positively correlated with social understanding. In general, progress in role-taking ability has shown to be beneficial for one's personal and interpersonal life. Better functioning in the interpersonal domain is particularly shown in the relation between role- taking ability and social problem solving ability. Role playing has been shown to improve male teenagers‚Äô handling of social problem tasks. Gehlbach (2004) found a similar supporting result, demonstrating that adolescents with better role taking abilities had superior ability in conflict resolution. Many other researchers have also found that role taking ability development positively affects interpersonal problem solving skills. Additionally, role taking can promote better social functioning in the interpersonal domain through smoothening social interactions by improving behavioural mimicking ability. Training children on role-taking ability can improve interpersonal functioning as well. In one study, preschoolers were made to role play interpersonal conflicts using puppets. Their task at the end was to discuss alternative solutions to the problems and how each solution would affect each character. Over the 10 weeks that the preschoolers participated in this role playing, their solutions became less aggressive and their classroom adjustment became better. Moreover, the use of role reversal in interpersonal problem situations has been found to stimulate cooperation, help participants better understand each other and each other's arguments and position, elicit new interpretations of the situation, change attitudes about the problem, and improve perceptions about the other person's efforts at solving the issue, willingness to compromise and cooperate, and trustworthiness. As a result of this research, it has been suggested that one way to improve cooperative skills is to improve affective role taking abilities. Role-taking can also work to decrease prejudice and stereotyping. Importantly, the decrease in prejudice and stereotyping occurs for both the target individual and the target's group. In addition, role taking ability has been demonstrated to decrease social aggression. Applications  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  Children with ADHD struggle in their social environments, but the social-cognitive reasons for this are unknown. Several studies have indicated a difference between children with and without ADHD on their role taking ability, wherein children with ADHD have lower role taking ability, lower role taking use, and slower role taking development than children without ADHD. Given these results, it has been suggested that children with ADHD be trained on role taking to improve their social skills, including their often comorbid oppositional and conduct problems. Delinquency and social-skills training The relationship between childhood and adolescent delinquency and role taking is considerable. Burack found that maltreated children and adolescents with behavioural problems exhibited egocentrism at higher levels than non-maltreated children and adolescents who had progressed faster and more expectedly in their role taking development. Chandler (1973) found that chronically delinquent boys exhibited lower role taking abilities so much so that their role taking ability was comparable to the role taking ability scores of non-delinquent children nearly half their age. In turn, one-third of the delinquent boys in this study were assigned to a treatment program designed to improve role taking skills. Post-treatment measures demonstrated that the program successfully induced role taking ability progress in this group, and an 18-month follow-up assessment found a nearly 50% decrease in delinquent behaviours following these progresses in role taking skills. The same has been found for delinquent girls. Chalmers and Townsend trained delinquent girls, ages 10‚Äì16, on role taking skills over 15 sessions, following which the girls demonstrated improved understanding of interpersonal situations and problems, greater empathy, more acceptance of individual differences, and exhibited more prosociality in the classroom. The overall picture, then, is that role-taking training can help delinquent youth and youth with conduct disorders as they lag behind in role-taking ability. Autism Several researchers have argued that the deficits in the social lives, communication ability, and imagination of autistic children are a result of their deficiencies in role taking. It is believed that autistic children's inability to role take prevents them from developing a theory of mind. Indeed, role taking has been described as the theory of mind in action. Failing to role take and failing to develop a theory of mind may lead autistic children to use only their own understanding of a situation to predict others‚Äô behaviour, resulting in deficits in social understanding. In support, two studies found shortcomings in role-taking ability in autistic children in comparison to controls. Pdf. Another study found that lower ability in role taking related significantly with the lower social competency in autistic children. In particular, the autistic children in the study could not focus concurrently on different cognitions required for successful role taking and proficient social interaction. More specifically, Dawson and Fernald found that conceptual role-taking related most to the social deficits and severity of autism experienced by autistic children, while affective role taking was related only to the severity of autism. Criticism The main criticism of Selman's role-taking theory is that it focuses too much on the effect of cognitive development on role-taking ability and social cognition, thereby overlooking the non-cognitive factors that affect children's abilities in these domains. For instance, social experiences, such as disagreements between close friends, have been found to foster role taking skills and social cognitive growth. In addition, parental influence amongst sibling conflicts matters, as mothers who act as mediators to help solve sibling disagreements have been found to promote role taking skills and social cognitive maturation.

History One of the first works to present this figure was a short musical play of 1892 called Santa Claus' Daughter (by Everett Elliott and F. W. Hardcastle). In this piece, the young Kitty Claus, who has known no one but her papa, asks him to find her a man. Books In his book, NOEL (2000) Ed McCray told the life story of the Clauses' daughter, Noel. Bestselling novelist James Patterson, wrote a book in 2004 for young audiences about Santa's daughter Chrissie. Chrissie spends her days playing with reindeer and elves. Until one day when the Big Boss of the Exmas Express company, Warrie Ransom, arrives and declares that \\"EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE\\" -- including Christmas! With the North Pole run by Exmas Express, work is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Spirits sink so low that poor Santa can't even get himself out of bed. But come Christmas Eve, someone has to make sure that children everywhere wake up to their gifts under the tree. It's Chrissie's memory of her father's own magical words that gives her the courage to save the day. In The Legend of Holly Claus (2006, by Brittney Ryan), Santa and Mrs. Claus enjoy a miraculous birth, but because of a terrible curse, the heart of their daughter is frozen. Television In recent years, Santa Claus' daughter has notably featured in a number of television films where she is often trying to help or to escape her father. * In Once Upon a Christmas (2001), Kristin Claus (Kathy Ireland) opposes her sister Rudolfa who is trying to ruin the spirit of Christmas. * In Santa Baby (2006), Mary Claus (Jenny McCarthy) is a businesswoman who tries to use her successful management techniques in the North Pole. * In Annie Claus Is Coming To Town (2011), Santa's daughter (Maria Thayer) moves to California to find love and have her own career. * In Becoming Santa (2015), Holly Claus (Laura Bell Bundy) brings her boyfriend home to meet the parents. * In the Disney+ film Noelle, Anna Kendrick plays the titular character who has to follow in her famous father's footsteps. * In the Netflix original movie Santa Girl (2019), Jennifer Stone plays Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Claus who wants to find herself and see the world and is reluctant to take over the family business despite the wishes of her father (played by Barry Bostwick). Comics * Jingle Belle features amazing teen-age Santa's daughter. * The Action Lab Entertainment comic book series NorthStars features a tween-aged Santa's daughter named Holly. Music A number of female singers have used Santa girl or Santa's daughter costumes for clips or shows.

The West Coast depot is in charge the basic training of all male candidates who join the Marine Corps from the west of the Mississippi  History  In 1921, the MCRDSD was formally commissioned and in 1923, after moving from Mare Navy Shipyards to Vallejo , California to San Diego, it became the primary recruiting center for the west coast. During World War II, the flow of recruits into the base surged, with 18,000 recruits arriving in one month. In 1948, the base was formally named Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and was home to the Recruit Training Regiment. In the 1970s, the focus was on the recruiting effort and the depot became the headquarters of the Western recruiting region.

During training, drill instructors train recruits in a wide variety of subjects including weapons training, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, personal hygiene and cleanliness, close order drill, and Marine Corps history. The training emphasizes physical fitness, and recruits must attain a minimum standard of fitness to graduate by passing a Physical Fitness Test. Recruits must also meet minimum combat- oriented swimming qualifications, qualify in rifle marksmanship with the M16A4 service rifle, and pass a 54-hour simulated combat exercise known as \\"The Crucible\\". Unlike training at Parris Island, recruits must leave the depot to conduct field training. Three weeks of the recruit‚Äôs training is spent at Edson Range aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, where recruits fire on the rifle range, conduct field training, and undergo the Crucible.

Prime examples of reality legal programs include Cops, Dateline NBC, Cold Case Files, etc. Many reality legal programs use elements from other television genres, such as documentaries, talk shows, news shows, caught-on-tape shows, etc. A vast majority of reality legal shows are legal news programs, providing clips and details of highly publicized crimes with commentary from news anchors, political figures, law experts, and other guests to help viewers understand the nature of the crime and any legal proceedings involved. Some of the clips take viewers into the courtrooms as well.

Originally, court shows were all dramatized, staged programs with actors playing the litigants, witnesses, lawyers, and sometimes the judges. Cases were either reenactments of actual real-life cases or altogether made up cases. Among examples of dramatized court shows include Famous Jury Trials, Your Witness, the first 2 runs of Divorce Court, etc. These types of court shows fall under legal dramas. The People's Court, however, revolutionized the court show genre by introducing a reality show format, known as arbitration- based \\"reality\\", in 1981. This was later adopted by the vast majority of court shows. Not all court shows have used the arbitration-based reality format however. Some are unaffected realities that draw on footage from real-life trials in real-life courtrooms.

He is known for his translation of Don Quixote in 1700.Don Quixote in translation Life Stevens was born in London, where his father was a page to Catherine of Braganza, and was educated by Benedictines at Douai, around 1675. He was bilingual, speaking Spanish from infancy, presumably with his mother. He served in the forces sent to quell Monmouth's Rebellion, and went with Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon to Dublin in 1685. He then through the Hyde connection became a tax official at Welshpool. Roman catholic and Jacobite, he fought in the Irish Williamite War and was at the siege of Limerick. He kept a diary of the conflict. Before 1695 Stevens had settled again in London. From that time till his death he was engaged in translations, and historical and antiquarian compilations. He was editor of the British Mercury from 1712 to 1715. He died on 27 October 1726. Works Stevens's first publication, an abridged translation in three volumes of Manuel de Faria y Sousa's Portuguesa Asia, appeared in 1695, with a dedication to Catharine of Braganza. In 1698 he produced a translation and continuation from 1640 of the same author's History of Portugal. His English version of Don Francisco Manuel de Mello's The Government of a Wife was issued in 1697. It was dedicated to Don Luis da Cunha, the Portuguese envoy. In the same year Stevens published a version of Quevedo's Fortune in her Wits, or the Hour of all Men. He issued in 1707 a translation of the collected comedies of Quevedo, which was republished in 1709 and in 1742. A collection of Spanish works translated and adapted by him appeared in the same year under the title of The Spanish Libertines. It consisted of Andr√©s P√©rez de Le√≥n's Justina, the Country Jilt (sometimes attributed to Francisco L√≥pez de Ubeda); Celestina, the Bawd of Madrid, by Fernando de Rojas; Gonzales, the Most Arch and Comical of Scoundrels; and Juan de √Åvila's comedy, An Evening's Intrigue, adapted by the translator. Stevens tried a revision of Thomas Shelton's English version of Don Quixote (second edition London, 1706, in 2 vols). It was dedicated to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and was illustrated by copperplates engraved from the Brussels edition. Stevens also translated in 1705 the so-called continuation of Don Quixote made by Alonzo Fernandez de Avellaneda, which had not before appeared in English. The version was prepared from the French of Le Sage. A rendering by Stevens of Quevedo's Pablo de Segovia the Spanish Sharper formed the basis of the Edinburgh version of 1798, and was reprinted in vol. ii of The Romancist and Novelist's Library, edited by W. C. Hazlitt, in 1841. Henry Edward Watts used it for his edition of 1892. Stevens also translated from the Spanish works of history and travel, as well as Quintana's The most Entertaining History of Hippolyto and Aminta, 2nd edit. 1729. His rendering of Mariana's History of Spain appeared in 1699; and of Sandoval's History of Charles V in 1703. In 1715 he translated Texeira's Spanish version of M√≠rkh√°nd's History of Persia. His translation of Herrera's General History of the Vast Continent and Islands of America, commonly called the West Indies, issued in 6 vols. 1725‚Äì1726, and reprinted in 1740, was a free version. From Spanish authors Stevens also mainly compiled his New Collection of Voyages and Travels, published in two volumes in 1711 (it originally appeared in monthly parts), and republished in 1719. Worksop Priory, engraving from Antient Abbeys (1722) Stevens was also an antiquary. In 1718 he published anonymously a translation and abridgment of William Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum. In 1722 he published a continuation of the Monasticon in 2 vols., as The History of the Antient Abbeys, Monasteries, Hospitals, Cathedrals, &c.;, illustrated with copperplates (and with additions from Hugh Todd). As a further continuation of the Monasticon Anglicanum Stevens issued anonymously in 1722, his Monasticon Hibernicum (a translation, with additions and alterations, of Louis Augustin Al√©mand's Histoire Monastique d'Irlande 1690). Stevens also translated Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. The rendering is very literal; some of the notes were used in William Hurst's version, published in 1814. Stevens's translation formed the basis of that of John Allen Giles (1840), and of that issued in Bohn's Antiquarian Library (1847). From the French Stevens translated in 1712 for Bernard Lintot parts of \\"Dupin\\", probably Louis Ellies Dupin's Biblioth√®que Universelle des Historiens; and Book iii of P. J. D'Orl√©ans's Histoire des R√©volutions en Angleterre sous la Famille des Stuarts, 1722. Stevens also compiled: * A Brief History of Spain, 1701. * The Ancient and Present State of Portugal, 1701, (based on Faria y Sousa's Europa Portuguesa). * The Lives and Actions of all the Sovereigns of Bavaria, 1706. * A Spanish-English and English-Spanish Dictionary, with Grammar, 1706; 1726. * The Royal Treasury of England; or an Historical Account of Taxes, 1725; 2nd edit., 1733.

Pursuant to this power, the Council has caused to be promulgated the Sacramento City Code, consisting of codified regulatory and penal ordinances. Every act prohibited or declared unlawful, and every failure to perform an act required, by the ordinances are misdemeanor crimes, unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code ¬ß 36900 et seq. Other governments  California  The Sacramento County Superior Court, which covers the entire county, is not a County department but a division of the State's trial court system. Historically, the courthouses were county-owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades. In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses). Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state. Sacramento County Sacramento is also part of Sacramento County, for which the Government of Sacramento County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California law, and the Charter of the County of Sacramento.California Government Code ¬ß 23004 Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of county governments such as the Government of Sacramento County. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. The County government is primarily composed of the elected five- member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices including the Sheriff, District Attorney, and Assessor, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Executive Officer.

The narrative is told in diary format and chronicles a few days in the life of a young woman (Jung Eun-chae) who falls into depression following the departure of her mother to Canada. She falls back on a troubled affair with a professor (Lee Sun-kyun), who offers to whisk her away. The film made its world premiere and screened in competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. The film was selected as part of the 2013 Hong Kong International Film Festival.

Birkin says how much Haewon resembles her own daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg, which pleases Haewon enormously. Immediately afterwards we find out that this meeting was actually a dream, one of several that Haewon is shown to have during the film. Haewon's mother is about to emigrate to Canada and stay with her brother, and asks Haewon about her future plans. Afterwards Haewon walks to Jongno Public Library, past Yoomyung-jang (lit. Hotel Famous) that has special memories for her. Later, in nearby Sajik Park, she meets her married ex-lover Lee Seong- joon (Lee Sun-kyun), a film director who is also her professor at college. They pass a restaurant, where they have already been spotted by his students, and decide to go in and have a meal with them. When Haewon is away from the table, the other students start gossiping about how she is not pure Korean and comes from a wealthy family. On March 27, Haewon and Seong-joon drive to Namhan Fortress () in Gwangju, Gyeonggi, where they get into an argument over how he broke up their relationship and how she had an affair with a fellow student, Jae-hong. On April 3, Haewon falls asleep in the college library and dreams of a fellow student, Yoo-ran, asking whether she's having an affair with Seong-jun. And then, while strolling around West Village, Haewon bumps into Joong-won (Kim Eui-sung), a professor from San Diego, California, who divorced a year ago and is looking to remarry someone like her. Later, while meeting her friend Yeon-joo (Ye Ji-won) and the latter's boyfriend Joong-sik (Yoo Jun-sang) at Namhan Fortress, she tells them about the meeting. And then Seong-joon calls her, demanding to meet immediately.

She is described as the most beautiful courtesan in the city of Luoyang and a reincarnation of the Peony fairy. Legends One of White Peony's legends comes from the novel Journey to the East.Wu Yuantai. Journey to the East (Dong You Ji)-Chinese text It is said that one day, the immortal L√º Dongbin took a walk in Luoyang spotted White Peony, and was attracted to her beauty. L√º Dongbin then transformed himself into a handsome scholar and slept with her many times. However, in accordance with Taoist alchemy, he never ejaculated, in order to preserve his Yang essence. Unfortunately, Lu's immortal colleague Iron-Crutch Li and He Xiangu taught Mudan how to make him ejaculate by tickling his groin. Finally, White Peony successfully made L√º Dongbin ejaculate and absorbed his Yang essence. Later she cultivated herself and became immortal as well.Chinese Mythology by Owen Giddens, and Sandra Giddens Feijianji, another novel from the Ming Dynasty had a slightly different version of this legend. According to Feijianji, Bai Mudan was a common girl (not a courtesan) who was seduced by L√º Dongbin. Later she became very weak since Lu practiced \\"cai yin bu yang\\" on her. Meaning he absorbed her yin (female) essence, without losing his own yang (male) essence. When her mother consulted with Buddhist Monk Huanglong (Yellow Dragon), he taught her how to make L√º Dongbin ejaculate and thus restore her yin essence. This event enraged L√º Dongbin, he tried to decapitate Huanglong using his flying sword but failed. In the end Lu admitted his mistakes and acknowledged Huanglong as his teacher. In another story White Peony was ordered by the minister Su Shi (Su Dongpo), to tempt his friend, monk Fo Yin.Anning Jing (2002.) The Water God's Temple of the Guangsheng Monastery: Cosmic Function of Art, Ritual and Theater Brill Some legends described Bai Mudan as a haughty courtesan who like to humiliate her clients.

Plot A military aircraft crashes in central London, releasing its highly classified contents. Following the crash, a malfunction at the Storage 24 facility causes the security shutters to lock, trapping several people inside: Charlie, his best friend Mark, Charlie's ex-girlfriend Shelley, her best friend Nikki, Nikki's boyfriend Chris, the building receptionist, Jake and a maintenance engineer, Bob. Charlie arrives at the facility with Mark shortly after the incident. However, since the facility‚Äôs power is intermittently failing and everyone else is forced back together when they realise they cannot leave the building. Meanwhile, Bob (the electrician) and Jake (the receptionist) are attempting to unlock the shutters by checking the electrical distribution boards in the basement. Bob is attacked and mysteriously killed. Jake flees and hides in an open storage room. Chris chances on him and witnesses him being killed by an alien creature. Looking around, Charlie, Mark, Shelley and Nikki come across Chris huddled in the room, in shock, with blood dripping onto his face from above. From this, they locate Jake‚Äôs shredded remains above the ceiling panels. As Nikki runs from the room, a middle-aged man grabs her, threatening her with an electric toothbrush. They stun him and tie him up, believing he is the murderer. When he regains consciousness, they learn he is merely an eccentric resident of a nearby storage unit, hiding from his wife. When Chris recovers they learn that a deadly creature of some kind is on the loose, and they are not safe. Together, they hide themselves in one of the storage rooms as the creature lurks outside. However, Chris runs; the creature catches him and rips out his heart. The group then decides to stay in the unit rented by the man, David, because it is lockable from the inside. David helps them to piece together what must have happened, by showing them the news channels on a collection of televisions he has acquired. Their only hope is to escape from the facility, and to do that they will need the engineer‚Äôs equipment in the basement. Before they venture there, they decide to use the ventilation ducts in order to search other units for weapons. Mark and Charlie search several units, but find only a knife, a crowbar, and some fireworks. As they return, the creature breaks through the duct inches from Charlie and Mark abandons him. Mark returns to the group and distributes the weapons, telling them that Charlie is dead. Charlie has somehow escaped the creature, and stumbles into the group; there is a slightly awkward reunion. Heading for the basement, they are confronted by the creature, and David sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape. They split into pairs to search the basement. Charlie and Nikki find the electronic keypad controlling the shutters near Bob's mutilated body. When they return, Mark is alone. He tells them Shelley has been taken by the creature and they must leave immediately. Charlie insists on a rescue attempt and doubles back with Nikki. In a corridor nearby, Shelley is held captive by the creature. As it prepares to kill her, she stabs it with the knife and runs, but is cornered in a lift. Charlie and Nikki send a walking toy dog rigged with lit fireworks down the hallway. The fireworks explode, allowing Shelley to escape to Charlie. Believing the creature dead, they run to Reception only to find Mark has barred its door with the crowbar. They plead with him; he stares distractedly, leaving them trapped. Charlie kicks the door open, and tries to open the shutters with the keypad. Just then the creature breaks through the wall behind Mark, and kills him. With Nikki‚Äôs aid, Charlie kills the creature by thrusting the crowbar through its abdomen and Says: ‚ÄòI Just want to go home.‚Äô Charlie finally releases the security shutters, and the trio emerge into the street. Shelley apologises and Charlie accepts the break-up. They go their separate ways. London is ablaze, under heavy attack from alien spaceships. The film ends abruptly.

In 2004 the group moved beyond its original purpose, adding to its membership other mandolinists from Peterborough and the surrounding area. At first practices were held in members' homes, but soon a larger space was needed and the group began meeting in the premises of the Art School of Peterborough. After spending a number of months building up a repertoire, the still somewhat small orchestra made its first solo appearance, providing the music at a fund raiser for the Art School in the Great Hall at Trent University.

It appointed John Horgan chairman on a salary of $800,000 p.a., and formed subsidiaries including Exim Corporation which sought to create and exploit export markets for education and other products.

Burke was also able to control the day-to-day operations and decisions made by those bodies through the appointment of unqualified but compliant friends to senior positions.

However, the Superannuation Board was to bear the entire cost of the project, making an elaborate loan to materialise Midtown's share of the expenses. When the agreement was drafted, in April 1985, the two parties were also planning \\"to secure title to the Perth Technical College site\\". Perth Technical College site The Perth Technical College site was of Crown land in a prime central location on the main street, St Georges Terrace, and opposite the David Jones site. In May 1984, Burke requested the WADC to manage development of the site, on which stood one important heritage building, the 1910 Technical School designed by Hillson Beasley. It was the first property sale handled by the WADC and was converted to freehold title by the issue of a Crown grant, in return for which the state received $20.5 million. The new title took effect on 10 December 1985, but on 20 September, the WADC received a purchase offer of $33.5 million from the Superannuation Board, Bond Corporation and Laurie Connell. It was proposed to lease the property back to the Education Department for $2 million p.a.

Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States from 1861 to 1865, has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names,Dennis, p. 194. Along with George Washington, he is an iconic image of American democracy and American nationalism. Changing image Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, states that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with \\"a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.\\" During the Great Depression, he says, Lincoln served \\"as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful.\\" Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for World War II, used the words of the American Civil War-era president to clarify the threat posed by Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan. Americans asked, \\"What would Lincoln do?\\"Barry Schwartz, Abraham Lincoln in the Post- Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America (2009) pp. xi, 9, 24 However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \\"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.\\"Barry Schwartz, Abraham Lincoln in the Post- Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America (2009) p. xi, 9 He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept. While Lincoln remains in the very top tier of the historical rankings of presidents of the United States, all of the presidents have slipped in historical prestige in the public's mind. Schwartz said that the reason is what he calls the \\"acids of equality\\": as the culture of the United States became more diverse, egalitarian, and multicultural, it also suffered a \\"deterioration and coarsening of traditional symbols and practices.\\"Schwartz, (1990) p. 190. Lincoln sites remain popular tourist attractions, but crowds have thinned. In the late 1960s, 650,000 people a year visited the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois, slipping to 393,000 in 2000‚Äì2003. Likewise visits to Lincoln's New Salem fell by half, probably because of the enormous draw of the new museum in Springfield. Visits to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. peaked at 4.3 million in 1987 and have since declined. However crowds at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. have grown sharply.Schwartz (2009), pp. 153‚Äì155. Organizations The oldest continuously-operating association in the United States honoring Lincoln is the Lincoln Association of Jersey City in Jersey City, New Jersey, which was formed in 1865 shortly after Lincoln's assassination. The association has held a banquet in Jersey City every year on Lincoln's birthday, February 12. The association has been addressed by a number of people of national importance, including political figures, military veterans, educators and civil rights leaders. The association celebrated its 150th anniversary on February 12, 2015, which included the laying of a wreath at the entrance to Jersey City's Lincoln Park. The association's annual dinner featured speaker Todd Brewster, author of Lincoln's Gamble, about the struggle to create the Emancipation Proclamation.\\"Lincoln Association of Jersey City marks 150th anniversary celebration year\\". The Union City Reporter. p. 14. Memorials The memorials include the name of the capital of Nebraska (1867). The first public monument to Abraham Lincoln, after his death, was a statue erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after his assassination. In 1876, on the anniversary of his death, a memorial, paid for by emancipated citizens to honor the Great Emancipator, the Freedmen's Memorial was dedicated in Lincoln Park, Washington DC. Present for the dedication was President Grant, cabinet members, representatives of both the Supreme Court and Congress, and the dedication speech was given by Frederick Douglass. The first national memorial to Abraham Lincoln was the historic Lincoln Highway, the first road for the automobile across the United States of America, which was dedicated in 1913, predating the 1921 dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. by nine years. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous other places, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and Lincoln's sculpture on Mount Rushmore, Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in Lincoln City, Indiana, Lincoln's New Salem, Illinois, and Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois commemorate the president.Peterson, pp. 312, 368, The Lincoln Memorial at Louisville Waterfront Park features a double-life-size sculpture of a seated, hatless Lincoln surrounded by narrative bas relief sculptures by Edward Hamilton which depict the history of slavery as witnessed by Lincoln in the slave markets of Kentucky.

The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois, contains his remains and those of his wife Mary and three of his four sons, Edward, William, and Thomas. Springfield's airport is named for him, the Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. There was also the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit in Disneyland, and the Hall of Presidents exhibit at Walt Disney World, which was based on Walt Disney admiring Lincoln ever since he was a little boy.

Mount Rushmore, showing the full size of the mountain and the scree of rocks from the sculpting and construction Desecration On the night of November 7, 1876, a group of counterfeiters entered Lincoln's tomb with the intent of absconding with his mortal remains and holding them for ransom in order to secure the release of their leader, Benjamin Boyd, an imprisoned engraver of counterfeit currency plates. The group entered his tomb, but had only succeeded in partially dislodging its marble lid before a US Secret Service agent who had infiltrated their number alerted law enforcement authorities. Although several escaped, most served a one-year prison term. For much of the next decade (c. 1876 ‚Äì 1887), Lincoln's tomb was mobile, to avoid further unwanted disinterment.

Within a year of this death, Lincoln's image began to be disseminated throughout the world on stamps. Pictured on many United States postage stamps, Lincoln is the only U.S. President to appear on a U.S. airmail stamp.William W. Cummings, and James B. Hatcher Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps (1982) p. 284. Lincoln was one of five people to be depicted on United States paper currency (federal issue) during their lifetime (along with Salmon P. Chase, Francis E. Spinner, Spencer M. Clark, and Winfield Scott). He has been featured on several denominations ($1, $5, $10, $20, $100, and $500) across different issues (e.g., Demand Notes, Legal Tender, Gold Certificates, Silver Certificates, etc.) since the first federally issued U.S. Bank Note in 1861. In addition to the modern United States five-dollar bill, currency honoring the president includes the Lincoln cent, which represents the first regularly circulating U.S. coin to feature an actual person's image. Lincoln's image on the five-dollar bill was used by Salvador Dal√≠ to help commemorate the U.S. Bicentennial with his creation of \\"Gala looking at the Mediterranean Sea which at a distance of 20 meters is transformed into the portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko)\\" and Lincoln in Dalivision, the earlier of which was displayed at The Guggenheim in New York during the 1976 Bicentennial. International Lincoln Family at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois The first statue of Lincoln outside the United States was erected in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1893. The work of George Edwin Bissell, it stands on a memorial to Scots immigrants who enlisted with the Union during the Civil War, the only memorial to the war erected outside the United States. A second statue by George Grey Barnard was erected in Manchester, England in 1919. Nowadays situated in Lincoln Square west of Manchester Town Hall, the statue commemorates the impact the American Civil War had on the cotton cloth-producing region of Manchester and Lancashire. A large statue of Lincoln standing by Saint Gaudens was unveiled near Westminster Abbey in London, on July 28, 1920, in an elaborate ceremony. The principal addresses were delivered in Central Hall, Westminster.Twenty-Sixth Annual Report of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society, 1921 (Albany, NY: J. B. Lyon Company Printers, 1922), pp. 194‚Äì95. In 1964, United States President Lyndon Johnson presented a Saint Gaudens to the people of Mexico, which is displayed in Mexico City's Parque Lincoln. Birthday Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was never a national holiday, but it was at one time observed by as many as 30 states. In 1971, Presidents Day became a national holiday, combining Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays and replacing most states' celebration of his birthday.Schwartz (2009), pp. 196‚Äì199. The Abraham Lincoln Association was formed in 1908 to commemorate the centennial of Lincoln's birth.Peterson pp. 147, 263.

He was a Raider in circle style kabaddi. Harjeet Brar was born in Bajakhana village in Faridkot, Punjab. His life ended short when killed in a motor vehicle accident. Early life of Harjit He was a big kid with a strong build and stature. Since Kabaddi was immensely popular in rural Punjab at that time, his father, Sardar Bakshish Singh encouraged him to play this sport. He started to play in local tournaments and soon made his presence felt in all the games he played. When Harjit Brar was in 8th standard, he participated in Mini Games at Guwahati and won the tournament. Seeing his determination and grip on the game, he was admitted to Sports college, Jalandhar, Punjab (India) and this is from where his professional Kabaddi career took off. Kabaddi career He made his International debut in 1994, when he came to play in Canada. His unmatched qualities and respect he showed for opponents soon made him the man of the masses. Harjit Bajakhana became a synonym to Kabaddi. During the final of 1996 Kabaddi World Cup, prize money of one lakh Rupees was awarded for his single winning raid. At one time in Canada, his one raid attracted a bet of $100,000.00. Such was his stature. Personal life He was married to Narinderjit Kaur and was blessed with a daughter, Gagan Harjeet Kaur a year later. Death On 16 April 1998, Harjeet Brar Bajakhana was killed in a tragic road accident along with three other prominent Kabbadi players, Talwar Kaonke, Kewal Lopoke and Kewal Sekha. Sukhchain Singh of Sidhwan Kalan village sustained serious injuries and was admitted to PGI. Following his treatment he was discharged from the hospital. According to their family members, Kabaddi players were on their way to New Delhi to acquire visas for their travel abroad. They were travelling on the Kharar-Morinda stretch of National Highway 95, in a Gypsy bearing registration number PB-10-U-0097. The accident took place near the town of Morinda, when a truck bearing registration number HR-35-2371, collided head on with their vehicle. It led to the killing of four of them on the spot and seriously injuring the fifth occupant. All four Kabaddi players were brought to a Kharar Hospital. Following the post-mortem examination, their bodies were subsequently released to their relatives. Harjit Bajakhana's death brought an abrupt end of an era. Harjeet Bajakhana had achieved what no other Kabaddi player could.

In the form that every curve of a given width has area at least as large as the Reuleaux triangle, it is also known as the Blaschke‚ÄìLebesgue inequality. It is named after Wilhelm Blaschke and Henri Lebesgue, who published it separately in the early 20th century. Statement The width of a convex set K in the Euclidean plane is defined as the minimum distance between any two parallel lines that enclose it. The two minimum- distance lines are both necessarily tangent lines to K, on opposite sides. A curve of constant width is the boundary of a convex set with the property that, for every direction of parallel lines, the two tangent lines with that direction that are tangent to opposite sides of the curve are at a distance equal to the width. These curves include both the circle and the Reuleaux triangle, a curved triangle formed from arcs of three equal-radius circles each centered at a crossing point of the other two circles. The area enclosed by a Reuleaux triangle with width w is :\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\pi - \\\\sqrt3)w^2 \\\\approx 0.70477w^2. The Blaschke‚ÄìLebesgue theorem states that this is the unique minimum possible area of a curve of constant width, and the Blaschke‚ÄìLebesgue inequality states that every convex set of width w has area at least this large, with equality only when the set is bounded by a Reuleaux triangle. History The Blaschke‚ÄìLebesgue theorem was published independently in 1914 by Henri Lebesgue and in 1915 by Wilhelm Blaschke. Since their work, several other proofs have been published. In other planes The same theorem is also true in the hyperbolic plane. For any convex distance function on the plane (a distance defined as the norm of the vector difference of points, for any norm), an analogous theorem holds true, according to which the minimum-area curve of constant width is an intersection of three metric disks, each centered on a boundary point of the other two. Application The Blaschke‚ÄìLebesgue theorem has been used to provide an efficient strategy for generalizations of the game of Battleship, in which one player has a ship formed by intersecting the integer grid with a convex set and the other player, after having found one point on this ship, is aiming to determine its location using the fewest possible missed shots. For a ship with n grid points, it is possible to bound the number of missed shots by O(\\\\log\\\\log n). Related problems By the isoperimetric inequality, the curve of constant width in the Euclidean plane with the largest area is a circle. The perimeter of a curve of constant width w is \\\\pi w, regardless of its shape; this is Barbier's theorem. It is unknown which surfaces of constant width in three- dimensional space have the minimum volume. Bonnesen and Fenchel conjectured in 1934 that the minimizers are the two Meissner bodies obtained by rounding some of the edges of a Reuleaux tetrahedron, but this remains unproven.

Career Middle school Diego Rovira, having not yet hit his infamous growth spurt of '99, spent his youth dominating the San Diego ping-pong circuit. Perfect vision combined with an unrivaled dexterity helped him win back-to-back San Diego championships. He was defeated in a 17-hour long sudden death match vs. Susie Meyers, forcing him into an early and not entirely gracious retirement. High school Diego Rovira was La Jolla Country Day High School's all-time leading scorer (47 goals). He was voted the team's Most Valuable Player three times and was a two-time team co-captain. He was selected first team CIF and all-league three times as well as a three-time San Diego Player of the Week honoree. He was chosen for the 2000 Reebok High School All-America Soccer Match, was a member of the District Olympic Development team from 1996‚Äì99, and was a State Olympic Development Team member in 1998 and 1999. College Rovira attended St. Mary's College, playing on the men's soccer team from 2000 to 2003. He was a midfielder who started for his final three years after missing much of his freshman year due to injury. Diego Rovira was Honorable Mention all-WCC his senior year. Indoor Soccer Rovira was second-team all-PASL in 2010-2011 after a breakout campaign in which Rovira scored 19 goals and 4 assists in 15 games. Diego Rovira battled through injury all season in 2011-2012 while remaining a key contributor both offensively and defensively for the three-time PASL champions, playing 12 games, recording seven goals and five assists (12 points), and tied for the team lead with two short-handed goals. After missing the first four games of the season with a foot injury, he immediately jump- started the Sockers‚Äô penalty killing unit. After Diego's return to the short- handed unit, the Sockers dominated PASL power play attacks, allowing seven goals in 34 chances (79%), while scoring seven short-handed goals. Rovira brought his offense to the fore in the Ron Newman Cup playoffs, scoring a goal and an assist in the Sockers‚Äô 9-6 semi-final win over Kansas, and directing a pair of assists in San Diego's 10-7 championship victory over Detroit. He has been reunited with childhood teammates Scott Martin and Jose Luna, who he played with on the San Diego Nomads.

The younger Roger de Montgomery, actually son of this Roger, was instead said by chronicler Robert of Torigni to have been born to a Hugh de Montgomery by Josseline, niece of Gunnor, Duchess of Normandy. One possible interpretation of this clear misstatement is that a generation has been dropped, and that it was the elder Roger who was son of Hugh and Josseline, though others conclude that Josseline's husband was the elder Roger, the assignment of the name Hugh to her husband being the error.

The alliance between the two countries has remained both strong and enduring to this day. Today Algeria is a strong supporter of the Middle East peace process but it has no diplomatic relations with Israel.  History  Algeria has long been a champion of the Palestinians in Israel ever since winning Independence from France in 1962. The National Liberation Front or FLN had been a strong backer of the Palestinian Cause. During the Algerian War of Independence from 1954 to 1962 many Palestinians saw Algeria and its struggle for independence as a good model to be learned from. Algeria has long supported the Palestine Liberation Organization since the 1970s and Algerian Presidents Houari Boumediene and Chadli Bendjedid both hosted and welcomed Yasser Arafat. Algeria also provided arms and training for Palestinian militants. In 1974 a Palestinian embassy was opened in Algeria and under Abdelaziz Bouteflika who was the President of the General Assembly, the PLO was admitted as an observer and Yasser Arafat addressed the United Nations General Assembly. In 1975, Algeria sponsored and voted in support of the UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 which equated Zionism with racism (the resolution, however, was later revoked with Resolution 4686 in 1991, but Algeria voted against that resolution). After the Camp David Accords Algeria had severed all diplomatic relations with Egypt and continued to support the Palestinians although this time in a low key fashion.Algeria - Arab and Middle East Affairs During the First Intifada, Algeria had strongly condemned Israeli actions and convened the 1988 Arab League summit.

Current relations  After the 1993 Oslo Accords, Algeria continued to support the cause of Palestine more than ever before and had also endorsed the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. Both Algerian Presidents Liamine Zeroual and Abdelaziz Bouteflika have been both balanced and moderate in that they both support the cause of the Palestinians while also working with the United States and other world powers for a just peace in the Middle East.

Music hall  In 1914, music hall was by far the most popular form of popular song. It was listened to and sung along to in theatres which were getting ever larger (three thousand seaters were not uncommon) and in which the musical acts were gradually overshadowing all other acts (animal imitators, acrobats, human freaks, conjurors, etc.) The industry was more and more dominated by chains of theatres like Moss, and by music publishers, since selling sheet music was very profitable indeed‚Äîa real hit could sell over a million copies. The seats at the music hall could be very cheap and attracted a largely working class audience, for whom a gramophone would generally be too expensive. Although many ordinary people had heard gramophones in seaside resorts or in park concerts organized by local councils, many more would discover the gramophone while in the army, since gramophone manufacturers produced large numbers of portable gramophones \\"for our soldiers in France\\". The repertoire of songs was dominated by the jauntily comic. Humorous stereotypes of domineering wives or mothers-in-law, the bourgeoisie, foreigners, Blacks and Jews were often subjects of songs. Many more songs were made up of tongue-twisters or other comic elements. Sentimental love songs and dreams of an ideal land (Ireland or Dixie in particular) made up another major category. Practically all the songs of the era are unknown today; several thousand music hall songs were published in the UK alone during the war years. The singers moved from town to town, many just scraping together a living, but a few making a lot of money. The key stars at the time included Marie Lloyd, Vesta Tilley, George Formby, Sr., Harry Lauder, Gertie Gitana and Harry Champion.  Enthusiasm for the war  1917 advertisement for \\"An 80 page pocket-size patriotic song book\\" At the outbreak of war, many songs were produced which called for young men to join up. Examples included \\"We Don't Want to Lose You, but We Think You Ought to Go\\", \\"Now You've Got the Khaki On\\" or \\"Kitcheners' Boys\\". After a few months of war and rising numbers of deaths, the recruitment songs all but disappeared, and the 1915 \\"Greatest hits\\" collection published by Francis and Day contains no recruitment songs at all. The music hall songs which mentioned the war (about a third of the total produced) were more and more dreams about the end of the war‚Äî\\"When the Boys Come Home\\" and \\"Keep the Home Fires Burning\\" are two well- known examples. Popular, patriotic songs that were composed during the war also served to raise the morale of soldiers and civilians alike. These hit songs covered a variety of themes, such as separation of loved ones, boot camp, war as an adventure, and humorous songs about the military life. Because there were no radios or televisions that reported the conditions of the battlefields, Americans had a romantic view of war. Not only were many of the songs patriotic, but they were also romantic. These songs portrayed soldiers as brave and noble, while the women were portrayed as fragile and loyal as they waited for their loved ones. Anti-war songs It was almost impossible to sing anti-war songs on the music-hall stage. The managers of music halls would be worried about their license, and the singalong nature of music hall songs meant that one needed to sing songs which had the support of the vast majority of the audience. In the music hall, dissent about the war drive was therefore limited to sarcastic songs such as \\"Oh It's a Lovely War\\" or bitter complaints about the stupidity of conscription tribunals (for example \\"The Military Representative\\"). When the anti-war movement had, for a few months in 1916, a mass audience, anti-war music hall songs from the United States such as \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier\\" were sung at anti-war meetings, but not on the music hall stage.

The Takagi‚ÄìLandsberg curve, a fractal that is the graph of a nowhere-differentiable but uniformly continuous function, is named after Teiji Takagi and him. Education and career Landsberg was born in Breslau, and earned a doctorate from the University of Breslau in 1890. He taught at the University of Heidelberg from 1893 to 1904, when he returned to Breslau as an extraordinary professor of mathematics. In 1906 he moved again, to the University of Kiel, where he was promoted in 1911; Werner Fenchel has called him \\"undoubtedly the most prominent\\" of the mathematicians at Kiel at this time.. Sources differ on whether he died in Kiel or Berlin. Mathematical research Landsberg studied the theory of functions of two variables and also the theory of higher dimensional curves. In particular he studied the role of these curves in the calculus of variations and in mechanics. He worked with ideas related to those of Weierstrass, Riemann and Heinrich Weber on theta functions and Gaussian sums. His most important work, however was his contribution to the development of the theory of algebraic functions of a single variable. Here he studied the Riemann-Roch theorem. He was able to combine Riemann's function theoretic approach with the Italian geometric approach and with the Weierstrass arithmetical approach. His arithmetic setting of this result led eventually to the modern abstract theory of algebraic functions. Works One of his most important works was Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen einer Varaiblen (Leipzig, 1902) which he wrote jointly with Kurt Hensel. This textbook has been described as \\"a classic in its field\\". and continued to be used for many years.

It opposed Nazi rule in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The group was founded by General Josef B√≠l√Ω in April 1939. The Gestapo was able to seek out and destroy the group's leadership on three occasions (February 1940, May 1942 and June 1944), but each time the group was reorganized. Overview of activities The formation of ON was the product of discussions among senior officers of the Army and Ministry of Defense that took place immediately after the Nazi occupation in March 1939. As early as March 19, some of the senior officers in the Czech army, including Gen. Sergej Ingr, Gen. Josef B√≠l√Ω, and Gen. Sergei Wojciechowski, began talking about establishing a military resistance organization. At first, ON was relatively disorganized, but within a short time it had established itself in Bohemia and Moravia and had developed contacts in Slovakia. By the summer of 1939, the basic structure of the organization had fallen into place. The commanders were all former military officers, and the teams were recruited mostly from organizations such as Sokol (the Czech Gymnastics Association), Eagle (a Catholic athletics organization), and the State Defense Guard. The original goal of fomenting an uprising against the Nazi occupiers power was soon abandoned as the ON became more focused on intelligence gathering and then on carrying out minor acts of sabotage. The ON had contact with the government-in-exile in London and was involved in helping people to leave the country. Three officers, Lt. Col. Josef Ma≈°√≠n, Lt. Col. Josef Balab√°n, and Capt. V√°clav Mor√°vek, who were known as the Three Kings, focused mainly on diversification activities and on acquiring weapons.≈†R√ÅMEK Pavel: ƒåeskosloven≈°t√≠ voj√°ci v odboji; in: Arm√°dn√≠ technick√Ω magaz√≠n, roƒç. 34/2002, ƒç. 12, pp. 41 ‚Äì 42 Counterespionage activity was under the control of Franti≈°ek Hieke. Men working under Hieke monitored collaborators, arrests, and the movements of Gestapo agents. During the Nazi occupation, many ON officers secured jobs at companies involved in strategic production, such as the ≈†koda factory in Plze≈à. These positions enabled them to formulate estimates of German military potential, which were transmitted to London. Some information was obtained from other resistance groups, especially the Schmoranz group. After the fall of Nazi Germany, ON hoped to serve as the Army of the restored Czechoslovakia and to maintain civil order until the return of political leaders from exile; but it proved difficult to secure the number of weapons necessary for these purposes. Activities in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ In the Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ region, the local ON group was formed shortly after the occupation. The founding members included Franti≈°ek ≈†lerka, Franti≈°ek Hrabal, Jana Essender, Josef Sta≈°ek, and Vojtƒõch ≈†upka. The ON group in the Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ region was liquidated by the Gestapo in two waves, the first in 1940 and the second in April 1941. Among this ON group‚Äôs activities were sabotage, weapons acquisition, and attempts at bacteriological attacks against the occupiers‚Äô infrastructure. Activities in Semily The ON group in Semily was founded by Franti≈°ek Hy≈°ka. Iterations =First iteration= ON was established in secrecy. Between June 1939 and the end of the summer of that year, 200 battalions and command structures had been formed, and by August members ON had managed to penetrate the Gestapo. In two waves of arrest, the first in autumn of 1939 and the second in February of 1940, the Gestapo effectively destroyed the group‚Äôs leadership. In two arrest waves (in the autumn of 1939 and in February of 1940), the first iteration of ON was almost entirely neutralized. From some of the arrested officers, the Gestapo confiscated lists of commanders and units, resulting in further arrests. Arrested officers were interned in concentration camps. Some officers escaped, and either went underground or emigrated. =Second iteration= At first, leaders of the second iteration of the ON sought to re-establish it as an underground army, but as it became clear that the war would last longer than expected, they abandoned the idea of having a large, tightly structured organization. Instead, this second iteration of the group was more diffuse in its organization. They also gave up their original objective of fomenting a nationwide uprising and instead chose to focus on intelligence, sabotage, and related activities. There was also a problem attracting new members, as the brutality of the Nazi occupation had scared many people away from the idea of resistance. In September 1941, Reinhard Heydrich was named Deputy Reich Protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the parts of Czechoslovakia that had been incorporated into the Reich on March 15, 1939. In that same month of September 1941, Heydrich ordered a major strike against ON. Further strikes occurred in the months that followed, so that by early 1942 only a few ON members, notably V√°clav Mor√°vek, remained at large. Heydrich died in June 1942 as a result of complications following an assassination attempt, and this triggered another round of ON arrests, which in effect destroyed the second iteration of the group. =Third iteration= In 1943-44, a military movement under the direction of Gen. Zdenek Novak was formed, but this group was virtually destroyed in a June 1944 strike by German security forces. =Fourth iteration= After the capture of Novak by the Gestapo, Gen. Frantisek Slunecek took command of ON, creating the ALEX Group, which focused on collecting information. By this point, ON bore virtually no resemblance to its first iteration: it had no unified command or hierarchy, and its cells were only loosely associated with one another, a state of affairs which minimized the danger that a single arrest would lead to many others. At the end of the war, the remnants of ON participated in the May uprising. Structure The original structure of the ON was based on the prewar military hierarchy. Under the main headquarters in Prague were provincial headquarters in Bohemia, Prague, and Moravia, and under them, in turn, were regional headquarters in Pardubice, Louny, Pilsen, Ceske Budejovice, Mlada Boleslav, Hradec Kralove, Brno, Olomouc, and Moravian Ostrava. Some ON groups also existed at the level of political districts, larger cities, and neighborhoods of Prague.HRBEK, Jaroslav; SMETANA, V√≠t; KOKO≈†KA, Stanislav; PIL√ÅT, Vladim√≠r; HOFMAN, Petr.

Geography Th·ªï Chu Island is located to the southwest of Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Island and R·∫°ch Gi√° and to the northwest of Cape C√† Mau, specifically , and away. There are four beaches on the island (Bai Ngu, Bai Dong, Bai Mun and Bai Nhat) of which the largest are Bai Ngu (literally \\"Royal Beach\\") and Bai Dong. Environment Th·ªï Chu Island has beautiful natural environment with high- density coral reefs, fine white sand beaches and pristine forests. A majority of 99 species of coral present here belong to two genera Montipora and Acropora of Acroporidae. The flora consists of about two hundreds of species, mostly Clusiaceae, Fabaceae v√† Sapotaceae. The island is also home to endemic gecko species Cyrtodactylus thochuensis. However, Th·ªï Chu is being threatened by environmental pollution since domestic waste is dumped into the sea. History During the era of Republic of Vietnam, Th·ªï Chu Island was under the administration of An Xuy√™n Province. On May 10, 1975, the Khmer Rouge occupied the island and, as reported by the Hanoi government, \\"destroyed villages, killed many people, and abducted 515 inhabitants of the island\\". From May 24 to May 27, 1975, Vietnamese forces attacked the occupiers and recaptured the island. In 1977, the Khmer Rouge raided Th·ªï Chu Island once again but were defeated. On April 27, 1992, under the arrangement of the People's Committee of Kien Giang Province, six families with about thirty people moved to Th·ªï Chu Island and settled there. On April 24, 1993, the Vietnamese government decided to establish Th·ªï Ch√¢u Commune which has been in charge of administrating the whole archipelago. Demography The majority of inhabitants are navy personnel and border guards who chose to settle on the island. As of early 2012, there are 513 households with about 1,700 people who mainly reside at Bai Ngu and Bai Dong. The residents' lives are not easy as they have to move around the island twice a year to avoid storms. In the southwest monsoon from April to August, people move from Bai Ngu to Bai Dong and in the northeast monsoon from September to March, they reverse their migration. Infrastructure Th·ªï Chu Island has only one electric generator for Bai Ngu. The island does not have a water supply network so military personnel and civilians have to dig wells to get water. Mobile information services of Viettel, MobiFone and Vinaphone have reached the island. Th·ªï Chu Island Lighthouse was set up on January 25, 2000. Its range is during daytime and in the nighttime. In addition, the island has a school, a post office and a temple commemorating the victims of the Khmer Rouge. Economy In general, the economy of Th·ªï Chu Island is still difficult. Local residents live mainly by fishing, including seafood trading and fisheries logistics. The efficiency in the exploitation of marine resources is only at low level. According to Decision No. 18/2009/QD-TTg by the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Tho Chu Island is planned to become a large fisheries service center of the region.
