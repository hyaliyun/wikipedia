This information can be used by content providers to produce content in an appropriate format for the specific device. UAProf is related to the Composite Capability/Preference Profiles Specification created by the World Wide Web Consortium. UAProf is based on RDF. UAProf files typically have the file extensions \`rdf\` or \`xml\`, and are usually served with mimetype application/xml. They are an XML-based file format. The RDF format means that the document schema is extensible. A UAProf file describes the capabilities of a mobile handset, including Vendor, Model, Screensize, Multimedia Capabilities, Character Set support, and more. Recent UAProfiles have also begun to include data conforming to MMS, PSS5 and PSS6 schemas, which includes much more detailed data about video, multimedia, streaming and MMS capabilities. A mobile handset sends a header within an http request, containing the URL to its UAProf. The http header is usually \`X-WAP-Profile:\`, but sometimes may look more like \`19-Profile:\`, \`WAP-Profile:\` or a number of other similar headers. UAProf production for a device is voluntary: for GSM devices, the UAProf is normally produced by the vendor of the device (e.g. Nokia, Samsung, LG) whereas for CDMA / BREW devices it's more common for the UAProf to be produced by the telecommunications company. A content delivery system (such as a WAP site) can use UAProf to adapt content for display, or to decide what items to offer for download. However, drawbacks to relying solely on UAProf are (See also ): # Not all devices have UAProfs (including many new Windows Mobile devices, iDen handsets, or legacy handsets) # Not all advertised UAProfs are available (about 20% of links supplied by handsets are dead or unavailable, according to figures from UAProfile.com) # UAProf can contain schema or data errors which can cause parsing to fail # Retrieving and parsing UAProfs in real-time is slow and can add substantial overhead to any given web request: necessitating the creation of a Device Description Repository to cache the UAProfs in, and a workflow to refresh UAProfs to check for deprecation. # There is no industry-wide data quality standard for the data within each field in an UAProf. # The UAProf document itself does not contain the user agents of the devices it might apply to in the schema (Nokia put it in the comments). # UAProf headers can often be plain wrong. (i.e. for a completely different device) UAProf device profiles are one of the sources of device capability information for WURFL, which maps the UAProfile schema to its own with many other items and boolean fields relating to device markup, multimedia capabilities and more. This XML data is keyed on the \`User-Agent:\` header in a web request. Another approach to the problem is to combine real- time derived information, component analysis, manual data and UAProfiles to deal with the actual device itself rather than the idealised representation of \\"offline\\" approaches such as UAProf or WURFL. This approach allows detection of devices modified by the user, Windows Mobile devices, Legacy devices, Spiders and Bots, and is evidenced in at least one commercially available system. The W3C MWI (Mobile Web Initiative) and the associated DDWG (Device Description Working Group), recognising the difficulty in collecting and keeping track of UAProfs and device handset information, and the practical shortcomings in the implementation of UAProf across the industry have outlined specifications for a Device Description Repository, in the expectation that an ecosystem of such Repositories will eventually eliminate the need for local device repositories in favour of a web service ecosystem.

He served one term as Member of Parliament (MP) for Belper in DerbyshireDod's Parliamentary Companion 1971 - New Government Edition, 149th issue, Epsom, Surrey, p.514-5 after he defeated the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party George Brown. In Parliament and outside it he was a fervent anti-Communist, and a leading member of the Conservative Monday Club.  Family  Geoffrey Stewart-Smith was born on 28 December 1933 in Ceylon, the only son and youngest child of Dudley Cautley Stewart-Smith and Phyllis n√©e Luson. He was educated at Winchester College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He subsequently served as an officer in the Black Watch regiment (1952‚Äì1960), including time in Nigeria and Germany.Dod's 1971, p.514. His marriage in 1956 ended in divorce in 1990. There were three sons of the marriage.  Entry into politics  During the 1960s, Stewart-Smith was active in anti-communist circles. He was also a supporter of Edward Martells's Freedom Group and worked on The New Daily. Apart from his numerous publications, in 1965, he recommended a form of recreation of the wartime Political Warfare Executive and the Special Operations Executive, in order to \\"counter subversion\\". The following year, he became an advisor to British Military Volunteer Forces, a group who had planned to send at least a battalion of British volunteers to fight with the Americans in the Vietnam War. Stewart-Smith had lengthy discussions with Colonel Frederick Lash, the US Military Attach√© in London on this issue. The British government, however, opposed the plan. In 1967, he organised an interdenominational service at the Royal Albert Hall to commemorate all those who had died at the hands of communists. His estimate was that the total was then about 95 million, and was printed on the back of the programme of service. More than 4,500 refugees from behind the Iron Curtain attended the service. He was disappointed that only two MPs and two Peers attended, and said that was \\"typical\\".  Publications  In 1962, Stewart-Smith founded the Foreign Affairs Circle, the British section of the World Anti-Communist League, which published the anti-Soviet East-West Digest, a fortnightly publication sent free of charge to all MP's. Stewart-Smith later founded the Foreign Affairs Publishing Company, which continued East-West Digest,Dod's, 1971, p.515. and published works from the British Right, such as Brian Crozier. It also distributed publications from British anti Union groups, such as Aims for Industry, Common Cause, the Economic League and IRIS.  Parliamentary activity  Stewart-Smith was selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Belper, Derbyshire, in 1966, and spent four years actively campaigning in the constituency to build up his profile. The constituency had been held by the Labour Party, but their hold grew increasingly tenuous, with prosperous suburbs of Derby encroaching on the seat. At the 1970 general election he sensationally ousted George Brown by 2,124 votes.Dod's, 1971, p.543. Regarded as a good constituency MP by fellow members, Stewart-Smith demanded that Edward Heath's government raise their pay offer to miners during the crippling strike. He also attacked Margaret Thatcher on the end of school milk during the same administration. However, his work was not enough to prevent him losing his seat in the February 1974 general election after boundary changes removed a large area of Conservative strength and the national trend favoured Labour.  After Parliament  Stewart-Smith decided not to seek re-adoption but to concentrate on publishing anti-communist literature, mainly through the Foreign Affairs Publishing Company, of which he was a Director.Dod's, 1971, p.515. The company lasted until it went into liquidation in 1986. He was Director of the Foreign Affairs Research Institute from 1976 to 1986, and Director of the Foreign Affairs Circle, and the Freedom Communications International News Agency. He was editor of the East-West Digest, and a regular columnist in the Financial Times from 1968.Dod's, 1971, p.515. He was a City of London Liveryman, belonging to the Grocers' Company. In 1974, he sought to distance his Foreign Affairs Circle from the World Anti-Communist League because of the WACL's perceived strong anti-Semitic element, saying: \\"We wouldn't touch them with a barge pole.\\" In 1978 he issued a press statement about what he claimed was the growing number of ex-communists and left-wing extremists in the Labour Party. Stewart-Smith was a leading activist in the Conservative Monday Club and in 1966 was chairman of its foreign affairs study group. In March 1975, he was one of the principal speakers at the Club's successful two-day Conference in Birmingham, the theme of which was \\"The Conservative Party and the Crisis in Britain\\".

Born in Norton, County Durham, David Townsend was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. He was a right-handed batsman, sometimes used as an opener, who holds the record of being the last cricketer to have played Test cricket for England without playing for one of the first-class English counties. Townsend's first- class cricket was principally for Oxford University and he won his Blue in the University match in 1933 and 1934. But his other cricket was mainly for Durham, which was at that time one of the Minor Counties. After two good university seasons, Townsend was picked for a rather makeshift Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side that toured the West Indies in 1934-35 under Bob Wyatt. He opened in three of the four Tests but was not a success, and the series as a whole was won by the West Indian cricket team, the side's first series victory. Townsend played little first-class cricket after this tour, though his final match was not until 1948. Townsend was the son of Charles Townsend, also an England Test player, and his own son, Jonathan, played first-class cricket for Oxford University in the 1960s.

Tonelli‚ÄìShanks cannot be used for composite moduli: finding square roots modulo composite numbers is a computational problem equivalent to integer factorization.Oded Goldreich, Computational complexity: a conceptual perspective, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 588. An equivalent, but slightly more redundant version of this algorithm was developed by Alberto Tonelli in 1891. The version discussed here was developed independently by Daniel Shanks in 1973, who explained: > My tardiness in learning of these historical references was because I had > lent Volume 1 of Dickson's History to a friend and it was never > returned.Daniel Shanks. Five Number-theoretic Algorithms. Proceedings of the > Second Manitoba Conference on Numerical Mathematics. Pp. 51‚Äì70. 1973. According to Dickson, Tonelli's algorithm can take square roots of x modulo prime powers pŒª apart from primes. Core ideas Given a non-zero n and an odd prime p, Euler's criterion tells us that n has a square root (i.e., n is a quadratic residue) if and only if: :n^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod p. In contrast, if a number z has no square root (is a non-residue), Euler's criterion tells us that: :z^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod p. It is not hard to find such z, because half of the integers between 1 and p-1 have this property. So we assume that we have access to such a non-residue. By (normally) dividing by 2 repeatedly, we can write p-1 as Q 2^S, where Q is odd. Note that if we try :R \\\\equiv n^{\\\\frac{Q+1}{2}} \\\\pmod p, then R^2 \\\\equiv n^{Q+1} = (n)(n^Q) \\\\pmod p. If t \\\\equiv n^Q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod p, then R is a square root of n. Otherwise, for M = S, we have R and t satisfying: * R^2 \\\\equiv nt \\\\pmod p; and * t is a 2^{M-1}-th root of 1 (because t^{2^{M-1}} = t^{2^{S-1}} \\\\equiv n^{Q 2^{S-1}} = n^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}}). If, given a choice of R and t for a particular M satisfying the above (where R is not a square root of n), we can easily calculate another R and t for M - 1 such that the above relations hold, then we can repeat this until t becomes a 2^0-th root of 1, i.e., t = 1. At that point R is a square root of n. We can check whether t is a 2^{M-2}-th root of 1 by squaring it M-2 times and check whether it is 1. If it is, then we do not need to do anything, the same choice of R and t works. But if it is not, t^{2^{M-2}} must be -1 (because squaring it gives 1, and there can only be two square roots 1 and -1 of 1 modulo p). To find a new pair of R and t, we can multiply R by a factor b, to be determined. Then t must be multiplied by a factor b^2 to keep R^2 \\\\equiv nt \\\\pmod p. So we need to find a factor b^2 so that tb^2 is a 2^{M-2}-th root of 1, or equivalently b^2 is a 2^{M-2}-th root of -1. The trick here is to make use of z, the known non- residue. The Euler's criterion applied to z shown above says that z^Q is a 2^{S-1}-th root of -1. So by squaring z^Q repeatedly, we have access to a sequence of 2^i-th root of -1. We can select the right one to serve as b. With a little bit of variable maintenance and trivial case compression, the algorithm below emerges naturally.  The algorithm  Operations and comparisons on elements of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} are implicitly mod p. Inputs: * p, a prime * n, an element of \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} such that solutions to the congruence r2 = n exist; when this is so we say that n is a quadratic residue mod p. Outputs: * r in \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} such that r2 = n Algorithm: # By factoring out powers of 2, find Q and S such that p-1=Q 2^S with Q odd # Search for a z in \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} which is a quadratic non-residue #* Half of the elements in the set will be quadratic non-residues #* Candidates can be tested with Euler's criterion or by finding the Jacobi symbol # Let #:\\\\begin{align} M &\\\\leftarrow S  c &\\\\leftarrow z^Q  t &\\\\leftarrow n^Q  R &\\\\leftarrow n^\\\\frac{Q+1}{2} \\\\end{align} # Loop: #* If t = 0, return r = 0 #* If t = 1, return r = R #* Otherwise, use repeated squaring to find the least i, 0 < i < M, such that t^{2^i} = 1 #* Let b \\\\leftarrow c^{2^{M-i-1}}, and set #*:\\\\begin{align} M &\\\\leftarrow i  c &\\\\leftarrow b^2  t &\\\\leftarrow tb^2  R &\\\\leftarrow Rb \\\\end{align} Once you have solved the congruence with r the second solution is -r \\\\pmod p. If the least i such that t^{2^i} = 1 is M, then no solution to the congruence exists, ie n is not a quadratic residue. This is most useful when p ‚â° 1 (mod 4). For primes such that p ‚â° 3 (mod 4), this problem has possible solutions r = \\\\pm n^{\\\\frac{p+1}{4}}\\\\pmod p. If these satisfy r^2 \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod p, they are the only solutions. If not, r^2 \\\\equiv -n \\\\pmod p, n is a quadratic non-residue, and there are no solutions. Proof We can show that at the start of each iteration of the loop the following loop invariants hold: * c^{2^{M-1}} = -1 * t^{2^{M-1}} = 1 * R^2 = tn Initially: * c^{2^{M-1}} = z^{Q2^{S-1}} = z^\\\\frac{p-1}{2} = -1 (since z is a quadratic nonresidue, per Euler's criterion) * t^{2^{M-1}} = n^{Q2^{S-1}} = n^\\\\frac{p-1}{2} = 1 (since n is a quadratic residue) * R^2 = n^{Q+1} = tn At each iteration, with M' , c' , t' , R' the new values replacing M, c, t, R: * c'^{2^{M'-1}} = (b^2)^{2^{i-1}} = c^{2^{M-i}2^{i-1}} = c^{2^{M-1}} = -1 * t'^{2^{M'-1}} = (tb^2)^{2^{i-1}} = t^{2^{i-1}}b^{2^i} = -1 \\\\cdot -1 = 1 ** t^{2^{i-1}} = -1 since we have that t^{2^i} = 1 but t^{2^{i-1}} eq 1 (i is the least value such that t^{2^i} = 1) ** b^{2^i} = c^{2^{M-i-1}2^i}= c^{2^{M-1}} = -1 * R'^2 = R^2b^2 = tnb^2 = t'n From t^{2^{M-1}} = 1 and the test against t = 1 at the start of the loop, we see that we will always find an i in 0 < i < M such that t^{2^i} = 1. M is strictly smaller on each iteration, and thus the algorithm is guaranteed to halt. When we hit the condition t = 1 and halt, the last loop invariant implies that R2 = n. =Order of t= We can alternately express the loop invariants using the order of the elements: * \\\\operatorname{ord}(c) = 2^M * \\\\operatorname{ord}(t)  2^{M-1} * R^2 = tn as before Each step of the algorithm moves t into a smaller subgroup by measuring the exact order of t and multiplying it by an element of the same order. Example Solving the congruence r2 ‚â° 5 (mod 41). 41 is prime as required and 41 ‚â° 1 (mod 4). 5 is a quadratic residue by Euler's criterion: 5^{\\\\frac{41-1}{2}} = 5^{20} = 1 (as before, operations in (\\\\mathbb{Z}/41\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times are implicitly mod 41). # p-1 = 40 = 5 \\\\cdot 2^3 so Q \\\\leftarrow 5, S \\\\leftarrow 3 # Find a value for z: #* 2^{\\\\frac{41-1}{2}} = 1, so 2 is a quadratic residue by Euler's criterion. #* 3^{\\\\frac{41-1}{2}} = 40 = -1, so 3 is a quadratic nonresidue: set z \\\\leftarrow 3 # Set #*M \\\\leftarrow S = 3 #*c \\\\leftarrow z^Q = 3^5 = 38 #*t \\\\leftarrow n^Q = 5^5 = 9 #*R \\\\leftarrow n^{\\\\frac{Q+1}{2}} = 5^{\\\\frac{5+1}{2}} = 2 # Loop: #* First iteration: #** t eq 1, so we're not finished #** t^{2^1} = 40, t^{2^2} = 1 so i \\\\leftarrow 2 #** b \\\\leftarrow c^{2^{M-i-1}} = 38^{2^{3-2-1}} = 38 #** M \\\\leftarrow i = 2 #** c \\\\leftarrow b^2 = 38^2 = 9 #** t \\\\leftarrow tb^2 = 9 \\\\cdot 9 = 40 #** R \\\\leftarrow Rb = 2 \\\\cdot 38 = 35 #* Second iteration: #** t eq 1, so we're still not finished #** t^{2^1} = 1 so i \\\\leftarrow 1 #** b \\\\leftarrow c^{2^{M-i-1}} = 9^{2^{2-1-1}} = 9 #** M \\\\leftarrow i = 1 #** c \\\\leftarrow b^2 = 9^2 = 40 #** t \\\\leftarrow tb^2 = 40 \\\\cdot 40 = 1 #** R \\\\leftarrow Rb = 35 \\\\cdot 9 = 28 #* Third iteration: #** t = 1, and we are finished; return r = R = 28 Indeed, 282 ‚â° 5 (mod 41) and (‚àí28)2 ‚â° 132 ‚â° 5 (mod 41). So the algorithm yields the two solutions to our congruence. Speed of the algorithm The Tonelli‚ÄìShanks algorithm requires (on average over all possible input (quadratic residues and quadratic nonresidues)) :2m+2k+\\\\frac{S(S-1)}{4} +\\\\frac{1}{2^{S-1}} - 9 modular multiplications, where m is the number of digits in the binary representation of p and k is the number of ones in the binary representation of p. If the required quadratic nonresidue z is to be found by checking if a randomly taken number y is a quadratic nonresidue, it requires (on average) 2 computations of the Legendre symbol.Gonzalo Tornaria - Square roots modulo p, page 2 https://doi.org/10.1007%2F3-540-45995-2_38 The average of two computations of the Legendre symbol are explained as follows: y is a quadratic residue with chance \\\\tfrac{\\\\tfrac{p+1}{2}}{p} = \\\\tfrac{1 + \\\\tfrac{1}{p}}{2}, which is smaller than 1 but \\\\geq \\\\tfrac{1}{2}, so we will on average need to check if a y is a quadratic residue two times. This shows essentially that the Tonelli‚ÄìShanks algorithm works very well if the modulus p is random, that is, if S is not particularly large with respect to the number of digits in the binary representation of p. As written above, Cipolla's algorithm works better than Tonelli‚ÄìShanks if (and only if) S(S-1) > 8m + 20. However, if one instead uses Sutherland's algorithm to perform the discrete logarithm computation in the 2-Sylow subgroup of \\\\mathbb{F}_p, one may replace S(S-1) with an expression that is asymptotically bounded by O(S\\\\log S/\\\\log\\\\log S). Explicitly, one computes e such that c^e\\\\equiv n^Q and then R\\\\equiv c^{-e/2} n^{(Q+1)/2} satisfies R^2\\\\equiv n (note that e is a multiple of 2 because n is a quadratic residue). The algorithm requires us to find a quadratic nonresidue z. There is no known deterministic algorithm that runs in polynomial time for finding such a z. However, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, there exists a quadratic nonresidue z < 2\\\\ln^2{p}, making it possible to check every z up to that limit and find a suitable z within polynomial time. Keep in mind, however, that this is a worst-case scenario; in general, z is found in on average 2 trials as stated above.  Uses  The Tonelli‚ÄìShanks algorithm can (naturally) be used for any process in which square roots modulo a prime are necessary. For example, it can be used for finding points on elliptic curves. It is also useful for the computations in the Rabin cryptosystem.  Generalizations  Tonelli‚ÄìShanks can be generalized to any cyclic group (instead of (\\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z})^\\\\times) and to kth roots for arbitrary integer k, in particular to taking the kth root of an element of a finite field.Adleman, L. M., K. Manders, and G. Miller: 1977, \`On taking roots in finite fields'. In: 18th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. pp. 175-177 If many square-roots must be done in the same cyclic group and S is not too large, a table of square-roots of the elements of 2-power order can be prepared in advance and the algorithm simplified and sped up as follows. # Factor out powers of 2 from p ‚àí 1, defining Q and S as: p-1 = Q2^S with Q odd. # Let R \\\\leftarrow n^{\\\\frac{Q+1}{2}}, t\\\\leftarrow n^Q \\\\equiv R^2/n # Find b from the table such that b^2 \\\\equiv t and set R \\\\equiv R/b #return R. = Tonelli's algorithm will work on mod p^k = According to Dickson's \\"Theory of Numbers\\" > A.

They finished as runners-up in 1956‚Äì57 and were champions in 1958‚Äì59, a season in which they also won the Derbyshire Senior Cup for the first time.Honours and records Belper Town F.C. When the Midland League was re-established in 1961, Belper joined the league.Midland Counties League 1958-1982 Non-League Matters They finished bottom of the league in 1969‚Äì70. After it was split into two divisions, Belper were placed in the Premier Division, of which they finished bottom in 1978‚Äì79. However, they were not relegated, and went on to win the Premier Division and the Derbyshire Senior Cup the following season. In 1982 the league merged with the Yorkshire League to form the Northern Counties East League, with Belper placed in the Premier Division. They won the Premier Division in 1984‚Äì85 and the President's Cup in 1995‚Äì96. The following season they finished as runners-up in the Premier Division and were promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League. When Division One was split in 2007, the club were placed in Division One South. After finishing as runners-up in 2008‚Äì09 (missing out on the title on goal difference) they qualified for the promotion play-offs. Although they beat Rushall Olympic 1‚Äì0 in the semi-finals, they lost the final 1‚Äì0 to Stocksbridge Park Steels. A third-place finish in 2012‚Äì13 led to another play- off campaign, which resulted in them losing 4‚Äì2 to Stamford in the semi- finals. However, after finishing fourth the following season, they defeated Leek Town 2‚Äì0 in the semi-finals and Mickleover Sports 1‚Äì0 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The club's first season in the Premier Division saw them finish bottom of the table, resulting in relegation back to Division One South. Ground The club originally played at the Acorn Ground, before moving to Christchurch Meadow in 1951, taking over from a junior team, Field Head.Belper Town Pyramid Passion The ground initially had a single stand on the northern side of the pitch, but it was demolished in the early 1960s to allow the adjacent West Mill to be extended. Parts of it were reused to build a new stand on the opposite side, although the stand ran from the halfway line to one corner rather than being positioned centrally. The club bought the freehold to the ground in 1986 for ¬£6,000. New dressing rooms were built in 1999 and new 500-seat stand opened in 2003. The ground also has a covered stand, the Reg Walker Stand, with a capacity of 300. The record attendance of 3,200 was set for a match against Ilkeston Town in 1955.

Located in the eastern part of Uttarakhand, it is the last valley before the border with Tibet. It runs along a NW to SE axis, formed by the river Kuthi Yankti, which is one of the headwaters of the Kali River that forms the boundary between India and Nepal in this region. This valley is mainly dominated by Byansis, one of the four Bhotiya communities of Kumaon, with the others being Johar, Darmiya and Chaudansi.: \\"[...] the four Kumaon Bhotia communities, viz., the Johar, the Darma, the Chaudans and the Byans, share greater similarities among themselves\\" In May 2020, Nepal laid claim to the northeastern half of the valley, claiming that Kuthi Yanki represented the Kali River and it was meant to be Nepal's border by the 1816 Sugauli Treaty. India said that the claim was not based on historical facts and evidence.New Nepal map hardens position over land disputed with India, Reuters, 20 May 2020.  Kuthi Yankti river  Kuthi Yankti is one of the two headwaters of the Kali River, the other being the Kalapani River that flows down from the Lipulekh Pass.: \\"The river Kaliganga forms a natural boundary between India and Nepal. It has two headwaters: the eastern one Kalapani is a collection of springs, and the western one Kutiyankti rises from the snow fields of the Himadri near Kuti, the last Bhotiya village in Vyas [Byas].\\" Kuthi Yankti emerges from slopes near Wilsha, below the Limpiyadhura range, and passes Lake Jolingkong at an altitude of 4,630 m, to the Kuti village. It flows southeast to merge with the Kalapani River near the Gunji village to form the Kali River (or Sharada River). High Himalayan passes of Mangsha Dhura (5,490 m) and Limpiya Dhura (5,530 m) are situated along the northern border of the Kuthi valley joining it with Tibet. Shin La pass and Nama pass join Darma Valley to Kuthi valley from the south. Jolingkong and Parvati are main alpine lakes. Sangthang Peak is the highest along the line of peaks forming the northern boundary of the valley with Tibet. Among the peaks forming the southern boundary of the valley, notable peaks are Brammah Parvat (6,321 m), Cheepaydang (6,220 m) and Adi Kailash (5,945 m).  Byans and Byansis  Kuthi Yankti is part of the Byans ethnographic region, which comprises Kuthi valley as well as the Kali River valley within its vicinity and the Tinkar valley in Nepal. The people of this region are called Byansis, who speak a distinctive Byangsi language. There are five Byans villages in the Kuthi valley (Gunji, Nabi, Rongkang, Napalchu and Kuti), two along the Kali River (Budi and Garbyang) and two in the Tinkar valley (Chhangru and Tinkar). In later times, two new villages were founded in Nepal (Rapla and Sitaula). Kuti is the last village in the Kuthi valley, at an elevation of . Garbyang, at the junction of Tinkar River with Kali, is the largest.  Nepalese claims  The Byans region was originally part of Kumaon and the whole of Kumaon was under rule of Nepal (Gorkha) for 25 years. After the Anglo-Nepalese War and the ensuing Treaty of Sugauli, the Kali River was agreed as the border between Kumaon and Nepal. In 1817, the Nepal Darbar claimed the villages of Tinkar and Chhangru as per the terms of the treaty, and the British Governor General acquiesced. The Nepalese then made the further claim that the Kuthi valley also belonged to them on the grounds that Kuthi Yankti was the main headwater of Kali. This claim was rejected by the British on the grounds that, by tradition and convention, the Kali River is taken to begin at the Kalapani village, where the dark-coloured springs flowing into the river give it the name \\"Kali\\". (\\"Kali\\" means black in Hindi.): \\"Captain Webb and others showed that the lesser stream flowing from the sacred fountain of Kalapani had always been recognised as the main branch of the Kali and had in fact given its name to the river during its course through the hills. The Government, therefore, decided to retain both Nabhi and Kunti, which have ever since remained attached to British Byans.\\" The claim to the Kuthi Valley was revived by the Nepalese geographer Buddhi Narayan Shrestha in 1999, who, after studying old maps of the early 19th century, came to the conclusion that \\"the origin of Mahakali River lies almost 16 kilometres northwest of Kalapani at Limpiyadhura\\". In May 2020, the Nepalese government made the claim official by endorsing a new map of Nepal that shows the Kuthi Valley as part of Nepal. The Prime Minister K. P.

He lived and worked for most of his life in Kopervik, Karm√∏y, Norway. In 1667 he was appointed royal antiquary of Iceland, and in 1682 King Christian V of Denmark appointed him Royal Historian of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway. He translated several Icelandic works into the Danish language and was the author of Historia Vinlandi√¶ Antiqu√¶ (1705); Gr≈ìnlandia Antiqua (1706); and Historia Rerum Norvegicarum (four volumes, 1711). In 1711, Torf√¶us's Historia rerum Norvegicarum (history of Norway, written in Latin) was published in four folio volumes. It was the first comprehensive presentation of Norwegian history since Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. The work covers Norwegian history, from its earliest beginnings until 1387. The focus ‚Äì and the strength of the work ‚Äì lies in the older, medieval history. Torf√¶us had at his disposal a number of medieval Old Norse saga manuscripts, and he was a pioneer in using these as source material. He reworked this Old Norse literature into a coherent Latin history. As well, he built on a large amount of historical narratives in Latin, both medieval and more recent. Thus, the work is based on a mixed foundation of medieval Old Norse saga tradition and contemporary continental Latin culture. Through his adaptation this Norse literary tradition became known to a large public ‚Äì Dano-Norwegian as well as European. What was written during the next century about older Norwegian history was almost invariably based on Torf√¶us's work. Ludvig Holberg praised the work as \\"one of the most impressive and wonderful histories ever to have seen the light.\\" Torf√¶us died on 31 July 1719 in Stangeland, Karm√∏y.

It ran from Mount Airy southeast to Sanford, primarily serving the Piedmont region. Some of the rails are still in use as of 2006 as parts of the Yadkin Valley Railway.  History  This railroad's short lifespan covered 1899 to 1950, but some of its rails were laid down in the 19th century as part of the Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railway (CF&YV;) which ran from the Atlantic port of Wilmington, North Carolina, all the way to Mount Airy with a significant branch to Bennettsville, South Carolina. The Atlantic and Yadkin Railway came into being when representatives of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad (soon to be reorganized as the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) outbid the Southern Railway for the debt-ridden and bankrupt CF&YV; in an 1899 auction. The Wilmington & Weldon Railroad (W&W;) had a clause in its incorporation that required any railroad purchased by the W&W; to be placed under the same corporate name. The W&W; did not want to own the whole of the CF&YV;, only that portion which competed directly with its own lines in southeast North Carolina. So the CF&YV; was sold to the Southern Railway, where it was reorganized as a new company under the name Atlantic and Yadkin Railway (A&Y;). The newly created A&Y; then sold back the southern half of its lines from Sanford to Wilmington to the W&W.; The northern half remained a wholly owned subsidiary of the Southern Railway. The questionable legality of the transaction regarding the split of the CF&YV; meant years of legal wrangling by angry investors and interested state citizens who saw the only \\"trunk\\" line from the western mountains to a North Carolina port split between two competitors. In 1924, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the sale and reorganization was legal. The Southern Railway wholly owned the A&Y;, but kept it as an independent entity throughout the legal battles. The line was considered part of the Southern Railway until 1917, when the A&Y; was allowed to run under its own name. In 1924, the A&Y; declared bankruptcy and was taken over by receivers. Receivership required a division of assets and separate operations from the Southern Railway. Eventually, the A&Y; was returned to solvency. The renewed profitability combined with the due date for the A&Y;'s $1.5 million in bonds in the late 1940s led the Southern Railway management to decide to merge the line into its own Winston-Salem Division. The Southern Railway paid the bonds and initiated a merger request. Despite some reservations by the merchants of Greensboro regarding lack of competition for rail transport in that growing city, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the merger effective January 1, 1950. At that time, the Atlantic & Yadkin Railway company ceased to exist.

They were founded in 1918 and currently play in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division. The club's reserve team play in the Humber Premier League division 1. History The club was founded in 1918 as Bridlington Central United after the First World War. The team joined the Driffield and District Minor League, soon joining the Driffield and District League. After several seasons of hard work, the team were promoted into the East Riding Amateur League, they won the championship five consecutive times during the 1950s. They also won the East Riding Senior Cup twice around this time. =Yorkshire League= The club changed their name to Bridlington Town F.C. in 1920 and moved into the Yorkshire League Division Two, during their first season in that league, they finished runners up and were promoted. In 1960‚Äì61 they reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup eventually losing out to Bishop Auckland who were very strong at the time. In the mid to late 1960s, Town built up a rivalry with fellow Bridlington side Bridlington Trinity. During the 1966‚Äì67 season in the Yorkshire League, Town won the championship while Trinity finished second. The following year it would be Trinity who took the title and Town finished in third. This rivalry continued until the early 1970s when Trinity became part of the Midland League. =Northern Counties East League= In 1982 the club were one of the founder members of the Northern Counties East League after the Yorkshire and Midland Leagues were merged. They were put into Northern Counties East League Division One, here they stayed for four seasons. By 1986‚Äì87, they were promoted to the Northern Counties East League Premier Division, even though they only finished sixth. This was because several teams in the Premier Division had resigned in the close season. This gave Town the opportunity to ignite their old rivalry with Bridlington Trinity, for the first time since the early 1970s. During the first three seasons in the Premier Division, Town finished higher. With a third and a fourth place, while Trinity were in the bottom half. The 1989‚Äì90 season was the concluding showdown for the two clubs. Town were crowned champions, while Trinity ended the season a respectable fourth. This would prove to be the end of the rivalry as Trinity folded due to the termination of their groundshare with Bridlington Town. Unfortunately for Bridlington, they were unable to put the icing on the cake in their FA Vase final clash at Wembley with Yeading, they drew the game, but lost in the replay 1‚Äì0 at Elland Road. =Cup and League success, before folding= Ken Richardson had joined the club as President and was essential in helping the club with the necessary finance to develop their ground, in order to climb the football ladder. They added a new stand, clubhouse, turnstiles and floodlights. Town marched on to the Northern Premier League Division One. The 1992‚Äì93 season was the most successful in the club's history, they finished as champions of the NPL Division One, and they finally took the FA Vase at Wembley, beating Tiverton Town 1‚Äì0. Alan Radford scored the only goal of the game. The sunny spell would not last. Due to legalities, the team was forced to play their home games at Doncaster Rovers' ground; Belle Vue. The club went into turmoil. They finished 21st in the Northern Premier League Premier Division and were deducted three points. Instead of going into Northern Premier League Division One, they folded. =Return= A local pub team The Greyhound, approached the lease-holders of Bridlington Town's former stadium Queensgate, looking for it to become their base. A deal was struck under the condition that the team would change their name to Bridlington Town AFC, essentially bringing the old club back to the town. The Greyhound club agreed and a new club crest was designed and a new motto \\"Pergere et Eniti\\", which means \\"Onwards and Upwards\\". The club returned on 10 September 1994, and were put into the league where they had originally played during their formative years; the Driffield and District League, it was literally back to square one. Bridlington progressed steadily, gaining entry to the East Riding County League Division One, they won the league and cup double. After three seasons in the East Riding County League Premier Division, Town finished runners-up and applied for promotion back into the Northern Counties East League Division One. They were accepted and spent three seasons at this level; finishing fifth, and then fourth, before achieving promotion with a runners-up spot in 2001‚Äì02. Town made their mark in 2002‚Äì03, reaching the quarter-final of the FA Vase before going out to Brigg Town. And they also reached the Fourth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup, eventually losing to Conference National side Southport. Bridlington Town won the league that year, they were crowned champions with 20 points ahead of the runners-up. =Recent times= The club were back in the Northern Premier League Division One and focused all their attention on it. Bridlington Town finished eleventh but were promoted back into the Northern Premier League Premier Division after the league was re-organised. Amazingly in 10 years after they were forced to start again, the club had pulled themselves back up to the highest division they had been in. It took the original club 85 years to reach that level. In 2007, it was announced that Bridlington Town would play in the inaugural season of the Northern Premier League Division One North. However a disastrous campaign followed, and they finished bottom of the division, and were relegated to the Northern Counties East League Premier Division. In 2012 The Seasiders won the East Riding Senior Cup, beating Hall Road Rangers (res) 9‚Äì2 in the final at the KC Stadium. They won the cup again in 2015 beating Hull United F.C. 4‚Äì2. In September 2016 Curtis Woodhouse was appointed as manager at Bridlington Town. Curtis Woodhouse remained as manager until September 2018. Since the departure of Curtis Woodhouse the team had been managed by aspiring caretaker manager Brett Agnew along with assistant Anthony Bowsley and after a successful trial period they were given the post on a permanent basis. The Seasiders finished a creditable 3rd place in the league and won the East Riding Senior Cup Final against Hull City u23s 3-1.

Ford won a silver medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and was the first person to swim the 100-yard freestyle in under 50 seconds. Biography Born in the Panama Canal Zone, he moved to Sarasota, Florida from Midland, Michigan. Ford attended U.S schools in the Panama Canal Zone, Mercersburg Academy, and graduated from Yale University with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in 1945. He served as an ensign in the U.S. Navy during the final months of World War II. During his prep and university swimming careers, Ford held numerous national and world records. While at Yale, he trained under swimming coach Robert J. H. Kiphuth, an innovator who introduced dry-land exercises and interval training. Ford broke Johnny Weissmuller's 17-year-old world record in the 100-yard freestyle. In 1944, Ford became the first person to swim 100 yards freestyle in less than 50 seconds, swimming's equivalent of running a sub-four-minute mile in track.Bruce Weber, \\" Alan Ford, Top Freestyler in 1940s, Is Dead at 84,\\" The New York Times (November 16, 2008). Retrieved March 17, 2015. Ford became known as the \\"human fish,\\" an unofficial title he took over from Weissmuller. This performance was unequaled for eight years. During his senior year at Yale University, he was the captain of Yale Bulldogs swimming and diving team. In 1944, when Ford was in the prime of his swimming career, the 1944 Summer Olympics were cancelled because of World War II. That year he won national college titles in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle and the 150-yard backstroke. He came out of retirement after the war and returned to New Haven to train with Kiphuth. He had lost as much as 25 pounds of muscle and hadn't been in a pool for three years. After only six months of training, and quitting smoking during that time, he made the U.S. Olympic Team and won a silver medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London in the 100 meter freestyle losing to his team mate Wally Ris. At the US Olympic trials of the 1948 4x200-meter freestyle relay, several swimmers who had already qualified in other events slowed down in their heats or swam fast in the prelims and scratched themselves for the final to allow more swimmers to qualify for the US Olympic Team.New York Times 25 July 1948 Page S3 Ultimately, coach Robert Kiphuth did hold a time trial shortly after the actual trialsNew York Times 28 July 1948 Page 29 with eleven of the swimmers. This time trial had Jimmy McLane as first overall with a time of 2:11.0, Bill Smith and Wally Wolf in 2:11.2, and Wally Ris in 2:12.4. This quartet was used for the Olympic final. The next four-Eugene Rogers in 2:14.2, Edwin Gilbert in 2:15.4, Robert Gibe in 2:15.6, and William Dudley in 2:15.9, were used in the Olympic prelims.Page 128 1948 US Olympic Book The next three swimmers-Joe Verdeur who came in 2:16.3, Alan Ford in 2;16.4 and George Hoogerhyde in 2:17.4 were not used in the 4x200 freestyle relay. After his graduation from Yale, Ford went on to become a mechanical engineer. Ford designed and managed the construction of oil refineries, chemical, ore, and food-processing plants as well as petroleum and chemical storage facilities in the United States and abroad. Ford was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an \\"Honor Swimmer\\" in 1966.International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, Alan Ford (USA). Retrieved March 17, 2015.

History After the dissolution of their former band, The Hilltops, Hudson and Stirratt moved back to Oxford and, joined by drummer Charles David Overton, began performing and recording roots rock. With this line-up, the band released their first self- titled album on their own 4-Barrel Records in 1993. The band was signed by the independent Roadrunner Records label and released their second album, Dog Days, with new drummer Frank Coutch in 1995. The album comprised many songs from their first eponymous release and garnered the band a fair amount of critical and commercial success in alt-country circles, featuring the band's best-known song, \\"Blue Canoe.\\" Two more albums followed on Roadrunner Records, Home Grown in 1997, and Tales of a Traveler in 1999.

Epps was elected to the Assembly on November 8, 2005, filling the seat of fellow Democrat Anthony Chiappone, who lost in the primary in his bid for re-election. Biography Epps was the Jersey City Superintendent of Schools.Assemblyman Epps' Legislative Website , New Jersey Legislature. (UPDATE JAN 2012: under substantial criticism from the public and from the elected Jersey City School Board, he is being paid one year's bonus salary of his contract in exchange for a agreement to resign without recourse. He also received great negative attention for allegedly unilaterally ordering the removal of the massive bronze statue of the city's founder, Peter Stuyvesant, from its place of honor in the heart of the site of the city's founding as the village of Bergen in 1640) Epps defeated the incumbent Chiappone in the Democratic primary with the support of the Hudson County Democratic Organization.Donohue, Joe. \\"Voters unseat two assemblymen: Handlin beats GOP veteran Azzolina as Epps ousts Democrat Chiappone in primaries\\", The Star-Ledger, June 8, 2005.

He was defeated by Charles Epps Jr., the Jersey City superintendent of schools and the party's preferred running mate for Assemblyman Louis Manzo (D-Hudson).\\" Epps served in the Assembly on the Environment and Solid Waste Committee and the Health and Senior Services Committee. In 2000, the State Board of Education approved Epps as the new State District Superintendent for the Jersey City Public Schools. Epps, who had served as the district‚Äôs Associate Superintendent for Community and Support Services since 1998, was recommended to the board by Commissioner David Hespe. Epps has dedicated his entire education career to the Jersey City School District. Since joining the district as a teacher of grades six and seven at the Whitney M. Young School in 1967, Epps has worked his way up through the ranks of the district as a teacher, supervisor, principal of adult evening programs, and director of funded programs. Many of Jersey City's record nine Best Practices awards received from the New Jersey Department of Education in 1998-2000 were for programs overseen or founded by Dr. Epps.Hudson County: Best Practices Award Winners, New Jersey Department of Education. Accessed August 4, 2007. He took a leadership role in the district's efforts to reduce the drop-out rate, which had fallen from a high of 14.6% to three straight years at 10% or lower, starting in the late 1990s. Epps has served as Chairman of the Hudson County Community College Board of Trustees, where he helped establish the Opportunity Knocks scholarship program allowing graduating seniors in Jersey City to attend Hudson County Community College tuition-free. Epps has long been active in the community and serves on several advisory boards, including the National Conference on Community and Justice, the Hudson Cradle advisory board, the Hudson County Schools of Technology advisory board, and the Jersey City welfare board. In 1999, he was recognized by both the NAACP (Outstanding Educator award) and the National Urban League (A Man for All Men award) for his contributions to Jersey City and its public school system. Epps received a B.A. in Education at Bishop College in Dallas, Texas, followed by a master's degree in Education from Seton Hall University and a doctorate in education from Rutgers University. Epps died after suffering a heart attack on March 17, 2015. Criticism There is much criticism of Mr. Epps' pay as superintendent (over $240,000 annually), particularly because Epps also is a member of the New Jersey Legislature ($49,000 annual pay) and the Jersey City Public Schools is one of the lowest performers in the state. As the Trenton Times editorialized about Mr Epps in an unsigned attack on double-dippers in state government: \\"Assemblyman Charles Epps Jr., D-Jersey City, spends at least two days a week at the State House, which is time when he's not back home running the troubled Jersey City school district, for which he receives $240,022 a year as superintendent.\\" In May 2006, Epps fell under attack by Assembly colleagues after the New Jersey 101.5 radio station reported on lavish expenses incurred by Epps on a trip to England‚Äîincluding a $500+/night hotel room‚Äîall paid for by taxpayers. A number of politicians called for his resignation as evidence of his fiscal irresponsibility surfaced.He broke his own rule: Epps' London trip violated $$ limits he implemented, Jersey Journal, May 13, 2006. The number (and salaries) of administrative staff housed at the Jersey City Board of Education has increased substantially in the 10 years since Epps became superintendent. Executives on the 8th floor of the Board of Ed Building on Claremont Ave. are notorious for not coming to work before 10 am and leaving early. While the school district is faced with budget cuts, hundreds of teachers received pink slips in April and May, while very few administrators or executives have been laid off, especially Epps' hand-picked assistants. Epps was ousted from the position. In April 2011, Epps came under criticism for denigrating his constituency in an address to the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Jersey and Vicinity. In his speech, he referred to the young females in his district, as his \\"worst enemy\\". He then elaborated, \\"The young girls are bad. I don't know what they're drinking today, but they're bad.\\", Time to Demand Epps' resignationJersey Journal, April 18, 2011.

Amenities include picnic pavilions, nature trails, a fishing pier, a boat ramp, bike trails and beaches. The park is open from 8:00 am till sundown year round. The coastal landscape and beach at Big Talbot Island is unique within the state of Florida for its rock-like sedimentary hardpan soil deposits underlying the surface. Where these formations are exposed in the shallow waters surrounded the island they provide habitat for molluscs, crabs, oysters, and other tide pool creatures. The formations and sand on Blackrock Beach are much darker in contrast to the coquina formations at Washington Oaks State Gardens, about 60 miles southward on the coastal highway A1A, and the limestone outcroppings at Blowing Rocks Preserve over 250 miles further south.

She was the head of a professionally trained mercenary army, inherited from her European mercenary husband, Walter Reinhardt Sombre. This mercenary army consisted of Europeans and Indians. She is also regarded as the only Catholic ruler in India, as she ruled the Principality of Sardhana in 18th- and 19th-century India.budhana Begum Sumru died immensely rich. Her inheritance was assessed as approximately 55.5 million gold marks in 1923 and 18 billion deutsch marks in 1953. Her inheritance continues to be disputed to this day. An organisation named \\"Reinhards Erbengemeinschaft\\" still strives to resolve the inheritance issue. During her lifetime she had converted to Christianity from Islam.The Indian Mutiny and the British Imagination by Gautam Chakravarty, Cambridge; Life Begum Samru's Household Begum Samru was of slight stature, fair complexion and distinguished by exceptional leadership abilities of an uncommon order. More than once, she headed her own troops in action. She was of Kashmiri descent. \\"She was originally said to be a Kashmiri dancing girl named Farzana Zeb un- Nissa.\\" When she was in her early teens, she married (or started living with) a mercenary soldier Walter Reinhardt Sombre of Luxembourg, who was operating in India. Walter Reinhardt Sombre, a European mercenary, then 45 years old, came to the red light area and fell for the charms of Farzana, then a girl of 14, says Johan Lall in his \\"Begum Samru - Faded Portrait in a Gilded Frame\\". A soldier of fortune, Sombre moved from Lucknow to Rohilkhand (near Bareilly), then to Agra, Deeg and Bharatpur and back to the Doab. Farzana helped him in those times of intrigue and counter-intrigue. =Ruler= On the death of her husband Walter Reinhardt in 1778, she succeeded to his Principality yielding about ¬£90,000 per annum. Over time, she became powerful, ruling over a large area from Sardhana, Uttar Pradesh. Her conduct in the internal management of her estate was highly commendable. On 7 May 1781, aged around forty, Begum Samru was baptized Joanna Nobilis, by a Roman Catholic priest. Throughout her life, she had only one friend, Begum Umdaa, who belonged to the other Jagirdar Family of Sardhana became her closest friend with time and fulfilled her relation until her death with Begum Samru. Even after Begum Umdaa was married, Begum Samru took out time to visit her to Meerut in good and bad. Farzana was courted by some of the European officers who were associated with her husband. Among them were Le Vassoult, a Frenchman, and George Thomas, an Irishman. The Begum favoured the Frenchman and when, in 1793, the rumour spread that she had married him, her troops mutinied. The couple sought to escape secretly by night - Le Vassoult on horseback and the Begum in a palanquin. Misinformed that Le Vassoult had been shot, she stabbed herself but survived. Her lover, however, died of a self-inflicted wound to the head. One version has it that she suggested a suicide pact but only nicked herself when the unsuspecting Le Vassoult shot himself dead. When British General Lord Lake met the Begum in 1802, in a fit of enthusiasm he gave her a hearty kiss, which appalled her troops. But with her customary tact, Begum Samru pacified them by saying that it was only \\"the kiss of the Padre to a repentant child\\". The Begum, though only 4 feet tall, wore a turban and rode on horseback as she led her troops to battle. So invincible did she seem that the superstitious spread the word that she was a witch who could destroy her enemies just by throwing her cloak towards them. Her army occupied the left of the Maratha line at the battle of Assaye and hers was the only part of the Mahratta force that was not driven in disarray from the battle field. Having annihilated an advance by the 74th Highlanders and a picket detachment commanded by a Colonel Orrock, her army then withstood a cavalry charge from the Raj before marching from the field in good order. She inducted Jats into her irregular armies.Nonica Datta, \\"Forming an identity\\", The Tribune, 3 July 1999.Nonica Datta, 1999, \\"Forming an Identity: A Social History of the Jats, Oxford University Press, page 12. After the fall of Aligarh in September 1803, she was induced to surrender to Lord Lake and afterwards lived on good terms with the British, receiving visitors including the Bishop of Calcutta, Reginald Heber, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army Lord Combermere and Italian adventurer Jean-Baptiste Ventura. =Death= She died at Sardhana in January 1837 at the age of 85, bequeathing the greater part of her property to David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, who descended from Walter Reinhardt Sombre, from his first wife. Several stories and novels have been written based on her political and diplomatic astuteness and on crucial battles fought by troops directly commanded by her.Profile , natgeotraveller.in; accessed 28 August 2014. There is a rumor that One of the sons of the Begum had been killed by the Begum herself, as he had some physical disorder due to which he couldn't get married. Palace at Chandni Chowk, Jharsa and Sardhana Samru's Palace at Chandni Chowk, Delhi, 1857, after Ghadar, Indian Rebellion of 1857 She built palaces at Sardhana, Chandni Chowk in Delhi and Jharsa. The paragana of Badshahpur-Jharsa in Gurugaon in Haryana was also ruled by Begum Samru. =Jharsa palace and cantonment in Gurugram= Begum Samru Place at Gurugram lies between Badshahpur-Jharsa in Gurgaon. The pargana of Badshahpur-Jharsa was ruled by Begum Samru.Begum Samru Palace, Gurugram, Haryana Tourism. She built a palace for herself between Badshahpur and Jharsa. Jharsa was the place of Samru's principal cantonment. Parts of her fort compound have been completely lost to encroachments. Palace building is located between Gurgaon and Jharsa village, which is used as the official residence cum camp office of the district collector of Gurugram district.

Shah Alam II, the predecessor and father of Akbar Shah, regarded Begum Samru as his daughter. He did so because the Begum had saved Delhi from an invasion by a force of 30,000 Sikhs, under Baghel Singh in 1783. They had encamped at Tis Hazari (the name of the place being derived from the number of those who constituted the force, estimated at 30,000). Thanks to the Begum's parleys, the Sikhs did not enter the city and went back to Punjab after getting a generous monetary gift from Shah Alam. In 1787(?), when the emperor, Shah Alam, blind and feeble, was in pursuit of Najaf Quli Khan and trying to quell the rebellion stirred up by him, an incident occurred at Gokalgarh that brought the Begum closer to Shah Alam. Seeing that the emperor's troops were wavering in their resolve to attack the rebel leader, she advanced with a force of 100 men and whatever big guns she had and opened fire on Najaf Quli Khan and his men. This did the trick and Najaf sought the Begum's help to make his peace with Shah Alam. Thankful for her intervention, the emperor bestowed special honours on her at the royal court and declared her to be \\"his most beloved daughter\\". Not only that, she was also confirmed in her estate at Sardhana, which was the subject of a dispute with Louis Balthazar alias Nawab Zafaryab Khan, another son of her late husband, General Sombre, by his first wife, Badi Bibi (senior wife).Until his death, Emperor Shah Alam and his major wives treated her almost as a relative, and embraced her when she entered the zenana (women) quarters. as the English visitor Ann Deane noted in late December 1808: \\" ....and afterwards I accompanied her to the royal residence ......we then ascended ....to the zenanah ['women's quarters'].... the begum now led the way through crowds of eunuchs ....Here we were met by the queen Dowager....an ugly, shriveled old woman, whom the begum embraced.\\" =Chandani Chowk palace= Begum Samru's palace in Chandni Chowk, now called Bhagirath Palace, was built in a garden gifted by Akbar Shah, a later day mughal, to the Begum when he ascended the throne after the death of Shah Alam in 1806. Her palatial building still stands in Chandni Chowk, New Delhi. It is currently owned by the State Bank of India, Chandni Chowk Branch. Death Inscription on the Statue of Begum Samru at the Basilica of Our Lady Of Graces in Sardhana Begum Samru died on 27 January 1836 at the age of 82 or 83 and was buried under the Basilica of Our Lady of Graces which she had built.  Popular culture  The Begum Samru is depicted as a prominent noble lady in TV drama series Beecham House first aired June 2019. The role was portrayed by Indian actress Lara Dutta.

The Square du Temple is a garden in Paris, France in the 3rd arrondissement, established in 1857. It is one of 24 city squares planned and created by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann and Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand. The Square occupies the site of a medieval fortress in Paris, built by the Knights Templar. Parts of the fortress were later used as a prison during the French Revolution, and then demolished by the mid-19th century. History =Knights Templar= The Knights Templar began in the 12th century, first constructing a fort (Vieux Temple or Old Temple) in Le Marais. In the 13th century, a new fortress was built as their European headquarters. The enclosure, called enclos du Temple, originally featured a number of buildings important to the running of The Order, and included a church and a massive turreted keep known as Grosse Tour (great tower) that housed a number of prized possessions of The Order, and a smaller tower called Tour de C√©sar (Caesar's Tower). The location of the towers is drawn on the floor in front of the town hall, on the . The heavy doors of the Grosse Tour still exist and are kept at Ch√¢teau de Vincennes whose great keep, attributed to of Notre-Dame cathedral, is speculated to have been inspired by the nearby Templar fortress.\\\\- =French Revolution= The Temple is also known for having been the place where the French royal family was jailed at the time of the Revolution. Members of the royal family imprisoned at the Temple's tower were: * King Louis XVI, from 13 August 1792 to 21 January 1793, when he was taken to be guillotined at the Place de la R√©volution; * Marie Antoinette, from 13 August 1792 to 1 August 1793 in the Temple's tower. She was then brought to the Conciergerie, from where she eventually was also taken to the guillotine; * Madame √âlisabeth, who stayed for 21 months at the tower before being taken on 9 May 1794 to the Conciergerie and guillotined the following day; * Louis XVII, from 13 August 1792 until his death of tuberculosis at the tower on 8 June 1795, at the age of ten; * Princess Marie-Th√©r√®se, who stayed at the tower for three years and four months before being sent into exile. =Demolition= By 1808, the Temple had become a place of pilgrimage for royalists, so Napoleon ordered its demolition, which took two years. Remnants were demolished around 1860 under orders from Napoleon III. Today Today its location is a station of the Paris Metro, serving the carreau du temple (covered market) and the Palais de Justice (Courthouse) of the third arrondissement. The garden includes a gazebo, a playground for children, lawns with the largest open to the public from 15 April to 15 October, fountains and a pond with an artificial waterfall, built from rocks brought in from the forest of Fontainebleau. The grid surrounding the square was designed by the architect Gabriel Davioud. The square contains almost 200 varieties of plants, including many exotic species, such as hazel, a Ginkgo biloba, a Honey locust of America, a Pterocarya fraxinifolia, goldenrain tree, Cedrela, and Chinese quince. In 2007, the square received the \\"ecological green spaces\\" awarded by ECOCERT, the international organic certification. There are two statues. One represents the songwriter Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger, who lived on the nearby street, which later took his name. This is the second in his image. A first bronze statue, by Am√©d√©e Donatien Doublemard, was erected with a public subscription opened in 1879 by the newspaper ‚Äò‚ÄôLa Chanson‚Äô‚Äô, and destroyed in 1941. It was replaced in 1953 by the present stone statue Henri Lagriffoul. Another statue, a bust on a pedestal, is dedicated: \\"To B. Wilhelm founder 1781 French ‚Äô‚Äô above a medallion portrait and the inscription \\"To Eug√®ne Delaporte founder 1818-1886 \\". On 26 October 2007, a monument was inaugurated on the lawn of the main square of the Temple. It carries the names and ages of 85 \\"little ones who do not have time to attend school,\\" Jewish children from 2 months to 6 years living in the 3rd arrondissement and deported between 1942 and 1944 and then murdered in Auschwitz. This monument was unveiled in the presence of several hundred people, city and district elected officials, representatives of associations and the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France. The memorial is one of several honouring the 11,400 Jewish children deported from France. The lists of children were compiled from school and civic records by Serge Klarsfeld.

Limestone was used for the lintels over windows, among other places. One of the large pieces of limestone being hauled by oxcart to the building site of Old Main slipped off the cart, landing on the ground in front of the building site, and it was left there after cleanup. During the 1880s, the university's authorities forbade the male and female students from being together at most times, requiring them to sit on opposite sides of a classroom, line up on opposite sides of the hallways and avoid each other in social situations. The Spoofer's Stone became a location for lovers to leave notes for one another. Later it became a popular location for men to propose marriage to women. The stone's ragged appearance is due to the tradition of breaking off a piece of the stone after a proposal, a practice which has been forbidden. The origin of the name \\"Spoofer\\" or who Spoofer was, is unknown. On Tuesday February 25, 2020 the stone was heavily damaged in a construction related accident. In the accident the stone was broken into several pieces. The University of Arkansas announced the damage on Facebook, but also stated that the plaque on the stone and a large portion that the plaque was attached to remain intact. The University said at the time that plans were already being discussed to restore the monument. http://www.arkansasalumni.org/s/1429/index.aspx?sid=1429&gid;=1&pgid;=451 =Courage to Lead= Courage to Lead is a bronze statue depicting Native Americans by Potawatomi sculptor Denny Haskewhttp://www.nationalsculptorsguild.com/artist_haskew.html donated by Don Marr and James Kunzelmann to the J.

A conference committee is a joint committee of the United States Congress appointed by the House of Representatives and Senate to resolve disagreements on a particular bill. A conference committee is usually composed of senior members of the standing committees of each house that originally considered the legislation. The use of the conference committee process has steadily declined in recent decades. 67 conference reports were produced as recently as the 104th Congress (1995-96), falling to just 3 conference reports in the 113th Congress (2013-14). Going to conference Conference committees operate after the House and the Senate have passed different versions of a bill. Conference committees exist to draft a compromise bill that both houses can accept. Both houses of Congress must eventually pass identical legislation for the bill to be presented to the President. The two houses can reach that point through the process of amendments between Houses, where the House passes the Senate bill with a House amendment, or vice versa, but this process can be cumbersome. Thus, some bills pass both Houses through the use of a conference committee.Sen. Procedure, 449. After one house passes a bill, the second house often passes the same bill, with an amendment representing the second house's work product. The second house then sends a message to the first house, asking the first house to concur with the second house's amendment. If the first house does not like the second house's amendment, then the first house can disagree with the amendment of the second house, request a conference, appoint conferees, and send a message to that effect to the second house. The second house then insists on its amendment, agrees to a conference, and appoints conferees. Each house determines the number of conferees from its house. The number of conferees need not be equal. To conclude its business, a majority of both House and Senate delegations to the conference must indicate their approval by signing the conference report. The authority to appoint conferees lies in the entire House, and the entire Senate can appoint conferees by adopting a debatable motion to do so.See Cong. Rec., 18 June 1968, 17,618-24; Sen. Procedure, 455. But leadership have increasingly exercised authority in the appointment of conferees. The House and Senate may instruct conferees, but these instructions are not binding. Authority  Conference committees can be extremely contentious, particularly if the houses are controlled by different parties. House rules require that one conference meeting be open to the public, unless the House, in open session, votes to close a meeting to the public. Apart from this one open meeting, conference committees usually meet in private, and are dominated by the chairs of the House and Senate committees. House and Senate rules forbid conferees from inserting in their report matter not committed to them by either House. But conference committees sometimes do introduce new matter. In such a case, the rules of each House let a member object through a point of order, though each House has procedures that let other members vote to waive the point of order. The House provides a procedure for striking the offending provision from the bill. Formerly, the Senate required a Senator to object to the whole bill as reported by the conference committee. If the objection was well-founded, the Presiding Officer ruled, and a Senator could appeal the ruling of the Chair. If the appeal was sustained by a majority of the Senate, it had precedential effect, eroding the rule on the scope of conference committees. From fall 1996 through 2000, the Senate had no limit on the scope of conference reports, and some argued that the majority abused the power of conference committees.Dauster, Bill. ‚ÄúFive-Man Senate? Rewriting the Rules on Conferences,‚Äù Roll Call, 10 Oct. 1996, 5. In December 2000, the Senate reinstated the prohibition of inserting matters outside the scope of conference.(See Consolidated Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001, , ¬ß 903 (2000), 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-198.) The rule changed again with the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, enacted in September 2007. Now any single Senator may raise a point of order against subject matter newly inserted by the conference committee without objecting to the rest of the bill. Proponents of the measure may move to waive the rule. The affirmative vote of 60 Senators is required to waive the rule. If the point of order is not waived and the Chair rules that the objection is well-founded, only the offending provision is stricken from the measure, and the Senate votes on sending the balance of the measure back to the House. Conference report Most times, the conference committee produces a conference report melding the work of the House and Senate into a final version of the bill. A conference report proposes legislative language as an amendment to the bill committed to conference. The conference report also includes a joint explanatory statement of the conference committee. This statement provides one of the best sources of legislative history on the bill. Chief Justice William Rehnquist once observed that the joint conference report of both Houses of Congress is considered highly reliable legislative history when interpreting a statute.Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 17-18 (1978) (Rehnquist, dissenting) Once a bill has been passed by a conference committee, it goes directly to the floor of both houses for a vote, and is not open to further amendment. In the first house to consider the conference report, a Member may move to recommit the bill to the conference committee. But once the first house has passed the conference report, the conference committee is dissolved, and the second house to act can no longer recommit the bill to conference.https://corg.indiana.edu/legislative-process Conference reports are privileged. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to a conference report is not debatable, although Senators can generally filibuster the conference report itself. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 limits debate on conference reports on budget resolutions and budget reconciliation bills to ten hours in the Senate, so Senators cannot filibuster those conference reports. The conference report must be approved by both the House and the Senate before the final bill is sent to the President. Declining use The use of the formal conference process has steadily declined in recent decades.

This may include the farmhouse, farm buildings such as a byre, dairy, and workers' cottages. It is pseudo-plural, actually being a Lowland Scots corruption of domains or demesne,The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and so is never used in the form \\"main\\" (except occasionally in the tautological \\"main farm\\", although this usage is not traditional).  Definition  The mains was usually the principal farm on an estate, or at least the one with the most fertile ground. The rough equivalent in England would be a 'home farm' (or perhaps 'manor farm', but not a 'manor' or 'manor house'). The laird's house ‚Äì if there was one ‚Äì may have been nearby or some distance away, but is not usually considered part of the mains. Many mains remain as working farms, while others have been converted to residential accommodation. Sometimes the buildings and/or farm have disappeared altogether, and only the name of the location survives.  Placenames  The word mains occurs frequently in Scottish placenames, most noticeably in the north east and east coast regions, extending down into East Lothian and Berwickshire, where examples include Auchencrow Mains, Blackadder Mains, and Hutton Mains. The usual form is \\"Mains of X\\", without the definite article \\"the\\", for example, \\"Mains of Hallhead\\". However, the best-known example of its use in a Scottish placename is Davidson's Mains, now a suburb of Edinburgh, which does not follow this form. Indeed, south of the M8, Mains almost invariably take the form \\"X Mains\\", as in \\"Mordington Mains\\". The same word usage to occur in Northern England, and farm names of the form \\"X Mains\\" can be found in northern Northumberland. Examples here include Adderstone Mains, near Bamburgh, and Burradon Mains, a few miles north of Rothbury in the Vale of Whittingham. In some cases, new owners have renamed various \\"mains\\" to \\"manor\\" in ignorance of the distinction in Scotland. The media occasionally uses the tautology, \\"Mains of X farm\\". Locally, it will be referred to as \\"the mains\\".  Others  Mains is also a family name and a sept of the Scottish clan Gunn.

According to registration papers filed with both the Canadian and Quebec governments, the private group was incorporated by executives of the Canadian Unity Council on September 7, 1995. The group was disbanded soon after the referendum was over. At the time of its operations, the group was composed of businessmen and political organizers of three federalist political parties - the Liberal Party of Canada, the Quebec Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. The president of Option Canada was Claude Dauphin, an aide to Paul Martin, at the time Canadian minister of finance. Option Canada first caught media attention in Quebec when the group created the Committee to Register Voters Outside Quebec in order to help citizens who had left Quebec in the two years before the referendum vote register on the electoral list of the province. Since 1989, a clause of the Quebec electoral law allows for ex- residents of Quebec to signal their intention of returning to Quebec and vote by mail. The Committee, which operated during the time of the referendum campaign, handed-out pamphlets which included the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec form to fill out in order to be added to the list of voters. The pamphlet also gave out a toll-free number as contact information which was the same number as the one used by the Canadian Unity Council. After the referendum, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec, Pierre F. C√¥t√©, filed 20 criminal charges of illegal expenditures and opened an inquiry on Option Canada. However, following Supreme Court ruling October 17, 1997(Libman vs. Quebec-Attorney General), some sections of Quebec's referendum law were judged unconstitutional. Quebec's Chief Electoral Officer consequently had to interrupt the conduct of his inquiry and drop the charges. Continued investigation by former Radio-Canada journalist Normand Lester lead the revelation of a $4.8-million grant awarded to Option Canada by Heritage Canada. In early January 2006, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had launched an inquiry on Option Canada at the request of the Department of Canadian Heritage. The Grenier report On 13 January 2006, Marcel Blanchet, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec, announced the appointment of Bernard Grenier, a retired Quebec Court judge, as investigating commissioner in charge of examining the documents. Grenier's report, without a mandate for laying charges, said Option Quebec spent $539,000 illegally supporting the \\"No\\" campaign during the 1995 Quebec Referendum on sovereignty. There were non-authorized expenditures under Quebec's strictures on referendums. Grenier's findings undermined Philpot and Lester's accusations that $3.5 million in federal funds was given to the \\"No\\" campaign against Quebec's electoral laws. Philpot and Lester called for a complete investigation. Jocelyn Beaudoin worked for the Option Canada group during the 1995 Quebec Referendum. He worked as Quebec's representative in Toronto, charged with defending Quebec's interests in Ontario, Western Canada and the territories. He was suspended with pay after the January 2006 publication of Les secrets d'Option Canada, a book which accused Beaudoin of using federal government money for the \\"No\\" campaign during the 1995 referendum. Grenier found that Beaudoin was an Option Canada decision-maker. Grenier said the evidence contradicted Beaudoin's claims he was not involved with Option Canada after 7 September 1995. Beaudoin had instructed personnel, negotiated applications for subsidies, and received $24,000 for his expense account. After the Grenier report was released, he resigned his position. In Ottawa, Labour and Quebec Economic Development Minister Jean-Pierre Blackburn defended Michelle D'Auray, who Grenier concluded spent $8583 of Option Canada funds that should have been submitted for approval. D'Auray now serves as Secretary of the Treasury Board of Canada.

It was funded by banker Darius Ogden Mills and designed by Ernest Flagg and opened in 1897. The building is now The Atrium.  Description  Mills House No. 1 is one of two survivors of three men's hotels built by banker Darius Ogden Mills in New York City. It originally contained 1,554 tiny rooms (7 and a half by 6 feet or 5 by 8 feet) that rented at the affordable rate of 20 cents a night, with meals costing 15 cents, The rooms contained only a bed with a mattress and two pillows, one stuffed with hair, the other with feathers, a chair and a clothes rack, and their walls stopped about a foot short of the ceiling. There were four toilets and six washbasins on each floor (for 162 rooms) and bathrooms on the ground floor. The building extends along Bleecker Street from Sullivan to Thompson streets, occupying four city lots. It was constructed on the site of a row of formerly fashionable houses called Depauw Row, which had become tenements. It cost $1.25 million to build and has eleven stories; two air shafts or light wells, square, capped by skylights, enabled each room to have a window and correspond to the provisions of the 1879 Tenement House Law known as the \\"Old Law\\"; the architect, Ernest Flagg, was an advocate for housing reform who had urged these requirements. The layout of the building may have been inspired by the layout of The Dakota (1884), or by apartment buildings he had seen in Paris. = Similar buildings = It was the prototype of the philanthropic hotel movement, although Mills emphasized that his hotels were run efficiently so as to make a modest profit for investors and \\"[not to offend] the pride or praiseworthy independence of those I serve.\\" It had its grand opening on November 1, 1897, the same day as the Astoria Hotel; Mills House No. 2, with 600 similar rooms, opened a few months later on Rivington Street at Chrystie Street on the Lower East Side. Mills House No. 3, which opened in 1907 with somewhat larger rooms and somewhat higher prices, still stands at 485 Seventh Avenue, at the northeast corner of 36th Street. Mills House No. 1 in 1905 Mills said he was inspired by the Rowton Houses in London, but wanted to improve on them by providing something less like a lodging house. Mills House hotels were closed during the day to encourage residents to seek work. Guests could not gain entry after midnight and were required to pay in advance; they were refused entry, even if they had prepaid, if they were drunk. Amenities included a library, and guests could also use a network of lounges. In 1902, Jacob A. Riis included the Mills Houses in his book The Battle with the Slum.  Operation and use  Mills House No. 1 was operated by a family trust after Mills' death until 1949, when it was sold and became the Greenwich Hotel; it remained for men only. By the 1960s, it became the first hotel in New York to be called a \\"welfare hotel\\". Some remembered it as \\"a mean flop house [where] winos and junkies could get a room ... for $2 a night\\"See also ; and where someone was once killed by a table that had been thrown out of a window. The jazz club The Village Gate operated from 1958 to 1994 in the former laundry in the basement of the building and later also on upper floors. The Atrium in 2006 In the early 1960s, the building was to have been converted into artists' and students' housing with theatre facilities under the name Renaissance House. In the mid-1970s, the building was gut-renovated and converted into an apartment house, named The Atrium for the covered courtyards. In the 1980s, the apartments were converted to a housing cooperative; in the mid-1990s, the exterior was renovated. There are 194 apartments, and some furnished suites available for short-term rental. The Village Gate space became a CVS Pharmacy with (Le) Poisson Rouge located below. Mills House No. 1 was planned to be designated as a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967, but the owner's lawyer objected.

She was most remembered for her contribution to the Indian independence movement; for being the driving force behind the renaissance of Indian handicrafts, handlooms, and theatre in independent India; and for upliftment of the socio-economic standard of Indian women by pioneering the co-operation. Several cultural institutions in India today exist because of her vision, including the National School of Drama, Sangeet Natak Akademi, Central Cottage Industries Emporium, and the Crafts Council of India. She stressed the significant role which handicrafts and cooperative grassroot movements play in the social and economic upliftment of the Indian people. To this end she withstood great opposition both before and after independence from the power centres. In 1974, she was awarded the Sangeet Natak Academy Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Academy, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama. She was conferred with Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan by Government of India in 1955 and 1987 respectively. Biography =Early life= Born on 3 April 1903 in Mangaluru, Kamaladevi was the fourth and youngest daughter of her parents. Her father, Ananthayya Dhareshwar, was the District Collector of Mangalore, and her mother, Girijabai, from whom she inherited an independent streak, belonged to a land-owning Chitrapur Saraswat brahmana family from coastal Karnataka. Kamaladevi's paternal grandmother was well-versed in the ancient Indian epics and puranas, and Girijabai was also well-educated, although mostly home- tutored. Together, their presence in the household gave Kamaladevi a firm grounding and provided benchmarks to respect for her intellect as well as her voice, something that she came to be known for in the future. Kamaladevi was an exceptional student and also exhibited qualities of determination and courage from an early age. Her parents befriended many prominent freedom fighters and intellectuals such as Mahadev Govind Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and women leaders like Ramabai Ranade, and Annie Besant. This made young Kamaladevi an early enthusiast of the swadeshi nationalist movement. She studied about ancient Sanskrit drama tradition of Kerala- Kutiyattam, from its greatest Guru and authority of Abhinaya, NƒÅtyƒÅchƒÅrya Padma Shri MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr by staying at Guru's home at Killikkurussimangalam. Tragedy struck early in life when her elder sister and best friend Saguna, whom she considered a role model, died in her teens, soon after her early marriage, and when she was just seven years old her father died as well. To add to her mother Girijabai's trouble, he died without leaving a will for his vast property, so according to property laws of the times, the entire property went to her stepson (Kamaladevi's half brother), and they only got a monthly allowance. Girijabai defiantly refused the allowance and decided to raise her daughters on her dowry property. Her rebellious streak was visible even as a child when young Kamaladevi questioned the aristocratic division of her mother's household, and preferred to mingle with her servants and their children wanting to understand their life as well. She was a great freedom fighter. =First marriage and widowhood= She got married in 1917 at the age of 14, but was widowed two years later. =1920s= Marriage to Harindranath Meanwhile studying in Queen Mary's College in Chennai, she came to know Suhasini Chattopadhyay, a fellow student and the younger sister of Sarojini Naidu, who later introduced Kamaladevi to their talented brother, Harin, by then a well-known poet-playwright-actor. It was their mutual interest in the arts, which brought them together. Finally, when she was twenty years old, Kamaladevi married Harindranath Chattopadhyay, much to the opposition of the orthodox society of the times, which was still heavily against widow marriage. Their only son Rama was born in the following year. Harin and Kamaladevi stayed together to pursue common dreams, which wouldn't have been possible otherwise, and in spite of many difficulties, they were able to work together, to produce plays and skits. Later she also acted in a few films, in an era when acting was considered unsuitable for women from respectable families. In her first stint, she acted in two silent films, including the first silent film of Kannada film industry, 'Mricchakatika'(Vasantsena) (1931), based on the famous play by Shudraka, also starring Yenakshi Rama Rao, and directed by pioneering Kannada director, Mohan Dayaram Bhavnani. In her second stint in films she acted in a 1943 Hindi film, Tansen, also starring K. L. Saigal and Khursheed, followed by Shankar Parvati (1943), and Dhanna Bhagat (1945). Eventually, after many years of marriage, they parted ways amicably. Kamaladevi broke a tradition by filing for divorce. Move to London Shortly after their marriage, Harin left for London, on his first trip abroad, and a few months later Kamaladevi joined him, where she joined Bedford College, University of London, and later she received a diploma in Sociology. Call of the Freedom Movement While still in London, Kamaladevi came to know of Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement in 1923, and she promptly returned to India, to join the Seva Dal, a Gandhian organisation set up to promote social upliftment. Soon she was placed in charge of the women's section of the Dal, where she got involved in recruiting, training and organising girls and women of all ages women across India, to become voluntary workers, 'sevikas'. In 1926, she met the suffragette Margaret E. Cousins, the founder of All India Women's Conference (AIWC), who inspired her to run for the Madras Provincial Legislative Assembly. Thus she became the first woman to run for a legislative seat in India. Though she could campaign for only a few days, she lost by a small margin of 55 votes. The All-India Women's Conference In the following year, she founded the All-India Women's Conference (AIWC) and became its first Organizing Secretary. In the following years, AIWC, grew up to become a national organisation of repute, with branches and voluntary programs run throughout the nation, and work steadfastly for legislative reforms. During her tenure, she travelled extensively to many European nations and was inspired to initiate several social reform and community welfare programs, and set up educational institutions, run for the woman, and by women. Another shining example in this series was the formation of Lady Irwin College for Home Sciences, one of its kind college for women of its times, in New Delhi. =1930s= Later she was a part of the seven member lead team, announced by Mahatma Gandhi, in the famous Salt Satyagraha (1930), to prepare Salt at the Bombay beachfront, the only other woman volunteer of the team was Avantikabai Gokhale. Later in a startling move, Kamaladevi went up to a nearby High Court, and asked a magistrate present there whether he would be interested in buying the \\"Freedom Salt\\" she had just prepared. On 26 January 1930 she gained widespread media attention when in a scuffle, she clung to the Indian tricolour to protect it.Kamala Devi Centenary Celebrated, Nehru Centre =1940s= When World War II broke out Kamaladevi was in England, and she immediately began a world tour to represent India's situation to other countries and drum up support for Independence after the war. Post- Independence work Independence of India, brought Partition in its wake, and she plunged into rehabilitation of the refugees. Her first task was to set up the Indian Cooperative Union to help with rehabilitation, and through the Union she made plans for a township on cooperative lines. At length Jawahar Lal Nehru reluctantly gave her permission on the condition that she did not ask for state assistance, and so after much struggle, the township of Faridabad was set up, on the outskirts of Delhi, rehabilitating over 50,000 refugees from the Northwest Frontier. She worked tirelessly in helping the refugees to establish new homes and new professions; for this they were trained in new skills. She also helped set up health facilities in the new town. Thus began the second phase of her life's work in rehabilitation of people as well as their lost crafts. She was considered singlehandedly responsible for the great revival of Indian handicrafts and handloom, in the post-independence era, and is considered her greatest legacy to modern India. =1950s and beyond= Around this time she became concerned at the possibility that the introduction of Western methods of factory-based mass production in India as part of Nehru's vision for India's development would affect traditional artisans, especially women in the unorganised sectors. She set up a series of crafts museums to hold and archive India's indigenous arts and crafts that served as a storehouse for indigenous know how. This included the Theater Crafts Museum in Delhi. She equally promoted arts and crafts, and instituted the National Awards for Master Craftsmen, and the culmination of her enterprising spirit led to the setting up of Central Cottage Industries Emporia throughout the nation to cater to the tastes of a nation, rising to its ancient glory. In 1964 she started the Natya Institute of Kathak and Choreography (NIKC), Bangalore, under the aegis of Bharatiya Natya Sangh, affiliated to the UNESCO.

However, a discrete symmetry can always be reinterpreted as a subset of some higher-dimensional continuous symmetry, e.g. reflection of a 2 dimensional object in 3 dimensional space can be achieved by continuously rotating that object 180 degrees across a non-parallel plane. Formalization The notion of continuous symmetry has largely and successfully been formalised in the mathematical notions of topological group, Lie group and group action. For most practical purposes continuous symmetry is modelled by a group action of a topological group that preserves some structure. Particularly, let f:X\\\\to Y be a function, and G is a group that acts on X then a subgroup H\\\\subseteq G is a symmetry of f if f(h\\\\cdot x) = f(x) for all h\\\\in H.'' =One-parameter subgroups= The simplest motions follow a one-parameter subgroup of a Lie group, such as the Euclidean group of three-dimensional space. For example translation parallel to the x-axis by u units, as u varies, is a one-parameter group of motions. Rotation around the z-axis is also a one-parameter group. Noether's theorem Continuous symmetry has a basic role in Noether's theorem in theoretical physics, in the derivation of conservation laws from symmetry principles, specifically for continuous symmetries. The search for continuous symmetries only intensified with the further developments of quantum field theory.

She was the recipient of several awards and accolades, and performed at several prestigious venues in India and abroad, including at the Royal Albert Hall, London (1967) and at the Carnegie Hall, New York (1976). Early life and background Sitara Devi was born in Kolkata (then Calcutta) on 8 November 1920, which in that year coincided with the festival of Dhanteras, the eve of the Indian festival of Dipavali. She was therefore named Dhanalakshmi, in honour of the goddess of good fortune who is worshiped especially on that day. Dhanalakshmi's paternal family was of Brahmin heritage and hailed originally from Varanasi, but had settled in Kolkata since many years. Her father, Sukhadev Maharaj, was a Brahmin gentleman and a Vaishanavite scholar of Sanskrit, but he earned his livelihood by teaching and performing the Kathak dance form. Her mother was Matsya Kumari, whose family belonged to the community of performing artists, and who claimed a relationship with the royal family of Nepal. Sukhadev Maharaj, while serving in the royal court of Nepal, had developed a passion for classical dance and done an in-depth study of Bharata Natyam and the Natya Shastra; he also practised and performed Kathak dancing in which he excelled. Kathak became his source of livelihood, as also a passion; this was fostered by his marriage to a woman with background in performing arts. The passion for dance was something he passed on to his daughters, Alaknanda, Tara, and Dhanno; and to his sons, Chaube and Pande. She could return to live with her parents' only when she was eight. She had met Rabindranath Tagore, and was encouraged by him to revive the lost Indian performing arts (like kathak), after that he died, and ensure elevation of them to a dignified status. Sukhadev Maharaj decided to realise this goal by contributing to reforming the kathak style of dancing. At that time, kathak was being performed by nautch girls or boys, and girls of decent families were not expected to learn this style of dancing. He decided to give religious input to the content, which was quite different from the content used by the nautch girls. Moreover, he decided to teach this form of dancing to his daughters and sons. Elders of his community were scandalised, and Sukhadev Maharaj was virtually excommunicated. Maharaj and his family members had to face the ire of the community members, and his daughters were called prostitutes. This did not deter him in his determination. Devi, recalling those moments, said: \\"My father used to say that when Radha could have danced for Krishna why not our girls? Why should men appropriate the right to dance?\\" Maharaj changed his residence, and came to another area of Varanasi. He established a school to teach children including his own daughters and sons dancing. He admitted children of prostitutes who came to the school to learn dancing. Once, the law enforcement authorities came to enquire about the affairs of the school, and Maharaj presented a performance based on the tales of the Mahabharata. She had been watching her sister, twenty years senior to her, learning dance, and she had managed to learn dancing well just by observation and self-practice. Like the tradition of the time, Devi was to be married when she was a small girl of eight, and her child bridegroom's family wanted to solemnise the marriage. However, she resisted, and wanted to be in a school. At her insistence, the marriage did not take place, and she was admitted into the Kamachhagarh High School. While at this school, a dance drama based on the mythological story of Savitri and Satyavan was to be enacted in a cultural program to be conducted by the students of the school. The school was searching amongst the students for someone to do a dance sequence embedded in the dance drama. Dhanno prevailed upon her teacher by showing her an impromptu dance performance. The performance clinched the role for her and she was also assigned the task to teach the dance to her co- performers in the sequence. After the dance drama, a local newspaper named the Aaj reported about the cultural program emphasising that a little girl name Dhanno had enchanted the audience by her dance performance. Her father saw the news, and this changed his perception about his girl with the \\"twisted mouth\\". Dhanno was re-christened as Sitara, and she was entrusted into the charge of her elder sister, Tara for imparting her dancing lessons. Incidentally, Tara is the mother of famous kathak dancer, Gopi Krishna. By the time Devi had turned ten, she was giving solo performances, mostly during the fifteen-minute recess during movies in a cinema of her father's friend. Her commitment to learning dance left her with very little time, and she did not continue her schooling. By the time she was eleven, her family shifted to Bombay (now called Mumbai). Soon after reaching Bombay, Devi gave a kathak performance in Atiya Begum Palace before a select audience, which included Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu and Sir Cowasji Jehangir. She impressed Tagore who wanted her to give a special performance in Tata Palace of the Tata Group. There the eleven-year-old dancing damsel studied kathak, with all its nuances, for three hours. Tagore called her to felicitate her in the traditional Indian style of giving her a shawl and a gift of Rs. 50 as a token of her appreciation. Recalling those moments, Devi once said: \\"But as I thrust out my hand to receive gifts, I remember my father nudged me and whispered in my ear: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt take only the gifts! He is a great man: ask for his blessings, girl!‚Äô Obediently, I asked Gurudev to bless me that I would become a great dancer some day.\\" Her debut was at Jehangir Hall (Mumbai), then the centre of metro‚Äôs cultural life. When she was a twelve-year-old girl, Devi was recruited by Niranjan Sharma, a filmmaker and a dance director, and she gave dance sequences in some Hindi movies including her debut in Usha Haran 1940, Nagina 1951, Roti, Vatan 1938, Anjali 1957 (directed by Chetan Anand, brother of Dev Anand). In Mother India 1957, she performed a Holi dance dressed as a boy, and this was her last dance in any movie. She stopped performing dances in movies, as they were adversely affecting her study in the classical dance, kathak. Rabindranath Tagore described her as Nritya Samragni ( ‡§®‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•Ä ), meaning the empress of dance, after watching her performance when she was just 16 years old. The epithet continues, and she is still described as the Kathak queen. Personal life Sitara Devi married three times. Her first husband was the actor Nazir Ahmed Khan (not to be confused with Nasir Khan who was Nazir's son-in-law). The age difference between them was sixteen years, and Nazir's first wife, Sikandara Begum, was always present. There was also a profound difference of religion, Khan being a Muslim and Sitara Devi a Hindu. At that time (before 1956), it was not possible for people belonging to different religions to marry and not possible for husband and wife to belong to different religions. Sitara converted to Islam in order to enter into this marriage. This marriage was both short-lived and childless, and they were soon divorced. Sitara Devi's second marriage was to film-maker K. Asif, who was not only the first cousin of her first husband but also the brother of Sikandara Begum. Once again, she became the second wife of a married man, and her co- wife was Akhtar Asif, sister of Dilip Kumar. This marriage also did not last very long, and it was childless. After her second divorce, Sitara married Pratap Barot, a Hindu gentleman of Gujarati heritage.https://chiloka.com/celebrity/sitara-devi-hindi The couple were blessed with a son, Ranjit Barot, born in 1950. IFFI 2010 Recognition Devi received a number of awards, including Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1969) and the Padma Shree (1973), Kalidas Samman (1995) and Nritya Nipuna. She refused to accept the Padma Bhushan award, declaring, \\"it is an insult, not an honor,\\" and as a report from the Press Trust of India quoted her saying: \\"is this government not aware of my contribution to Kathak? I will not accept any award less than Bharat Ratna.\\" On 8 November 2017, Google showed a Doodle in India for Sitara Devi‚Äôs 97th Birthday.https://www.google.com/doodles/sitara- devis-97th-birthdayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jktv3PdWiBg Later years Although her forte was kathak, she was also an accomplished dancer in many other styles of dancing including Bharatanatyam and many forms of folk dances of India. She also learned the Russian ballet, and other dances of the western world. With advancing age, her dancing activities diminished, and she was working on compiling a book encapsulating the research done by her father and her in the field of dancing, especially in kathak style of dancing. She taught kathak dancing to Bollywood celebrities such as Madhubala, Rekha, Mala Sinha, and Kajol. She envisioned formalizing her teaching, and planned to set up a Kathak training academy. She died on 25 November 2014, at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, after a prolonged illness.

Cuming (December 25, 1827 ‚Äì March 12, 1858) was an American military officer and politician. He served as the first Secretary of Nebraska Territory and served twice as the territory's Acting Governor, the first time following the death of Francis Burt and the second following the resignation of Mark W. Izard. Background Cuming was born in Genesee County, New York on December 25, 1827. The son of an Episcopal minister, his mother died when he was a young child. Following his mother's death he was raise by his uncle, a Prebysterian residing in Rochester, New York. Cuming was admitted to The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor at an early age and graduated at the age of sixteen. Following his graduation he worked as a geologist in a scientific expedition exploring the Lake Superior region for minerals. In November 1847, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Cuming enlisted as a sergeant with the 1st Michigan Infantry Regiment. His assigned duties kept him away from battle for the course of the hostilities. Following the war he became a telegraph operator in Keokuk, Iowa. Looking to advance himself, he began writing articles for the Keokuk Dispatch. Reaction to these articles was extremely favorable and Cuming was made editor of the newspaper. During his time in Keokuk, he also married Margaret C. Murphy. Nebraska Cuming was appointed Secretary of the newly formed Nebraska Territory at the age of 25 and arrived to assume his duties on October 8, 1854. Ten days later, with the death of Governor Francis Burt, Cuming became Acting Governor. Among his first duties as Acting Governor, Cuming ordered a census of the territory and preparations for the territory's first legislative session. Despite Governor Burt's intention to have the capital in Bellevue, Cuming chose to place it in Omaha. The choice of a location north of the Platte River, while beneficial to Cuming's political allies in Council Bluffs, Iowa, angered many of the territory's 2,732 residents, 1,818 of whom lived south of the river. The Acting Governor further complicated the situation by allocating a majority of the legislative representation to counties north of the river. As a result, when the legislature convened on January 16, 1855, it dedicated most of its energies in examining Cuming's role in making Omaha the territorial capital. With the arrival of Governor Mark W. Izard, Cuming resumed his role as Territorial Secretary. The political split between north and south continued however, with a short lived effort to have southern Nebraska annexed into Kansas taking place. Following the resignation of Governor Izard, Cuming again became Acting Governor until the arrival of Governor William Alexander Richardson. Cuming died on March 12, 1858, at the age of 30. Cuming County, Nebraska was named after him.

He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1845. He was appointed to a position in the United States Land Office from 1849 to 1852; he then resumed the practice of law in McConnelsville, Ohio, in 1853. He was ordained a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1856. Around 1859, he moved to Brownville, Nebraska and joined the Congregational Church. He was a member of the 1859 Nebraska constitutional convention and the Nebraska Territory council in 1860. During the American Civil War, Tipton was appointed chaplain of the First Regiment, Nebraska Volunteer Infantry 1861‚Äì1865. He was the assessor of internal revenue for Nebraska in 1865, and a member of the State constitutional convention in 1867. Upon the admission of Nebraska as a State into the Union, he was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1867. Tipton was reelected in 1869 and served from March 1, 1867, to March 3, 1875. \\"Tipton looks the Radical all over, but doesn't always act it,\\" a Washington correspondent wrote in 1868. \\"There is not another man in the Senate whose appearance goes so far to make up the beau ideal of unpolished earnestness. Full six feet in height, straight as an arrow, with long brown hair combed back from his forehead till it touches his coat collar, a pair of eyes that never look, but always glare or stare, and seem ready to jump from their sockets through the gold-rimmed spectacles in front of them, when their owner gets excited, which occurs every time he speaks in debate; a low forehead, a sharp nose and a mouth and chin which tell of bull-dog courage and determination, these, and the matter and manner of his speeches in the Senate, remind the student of history of what might have been the leader of the Barebones Parliament two hundred years ago.\\"Cincinnati Commercial, March 19, 1868. Tipton had been elected as a Republican and voted for the conviction of President Andrew Johnson in the 1868 impeachment trial. By 1872, however, he had fallen out of favor with the Grant Administration and became a strong critic of the president's policies. Endorsing the Liberal Republican movement and favoring Horace Greeley for president that year, he effectively read himself out of the party. After that, he resumed the practice of law and was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Nebraska in 1880. He died in Washington, D.C., November 26, 1899, and was interred in Rock Creek Cemetery.

The story As many flashy cars drive toward Dublin, crowds gather and cheer. A race has just finished, and though the French have placed second and third after the German‚ÄìBelgian team, the local sightseers loudly support them. Jimmy Doyle rides in one of the cars with his wealthy French friend, Charles S√©gouin, whom he met while studying at Cambridge. Two other men ride with them as well: S√©gouin‚Äôs Canadian cousin, Andr√© Rivi√®re, and a Hungarian pianist, Villona. Driving back into Dublin, the young men rejoice about the victory, and Jimmy enjoys the prestige of the ride. He fondly thinks about his recent investment in S√©gouin‚Äôs motor-company business venture, a financial backing that his father, a successful butcher, approves and supports. Jimmy savors the notoriety of being surrounded by and seen with such glamorous company, and in such a luxurious car. S√©gouin drops Jimmy and Villona off in Dublin so they can return to Jimmy‚Äôs home, where Villona is staying, to change into formal dress for dinner at S√©gouin‚Äôs hotel. Jimmy‚Äôs proud parents dote on their smartly dressed and well-connected son. At the dinner, the reunited party joins an Englishman, Routh, and conversation energetically moves from music to cars to politics, under the direction of S√©gouin. Jimmy, turning to Irish‚ÄìEnglish relations, rouses an angry response from Routh, but S√©gouin expertly snuffs any potential for argument with a toast. After the meal, the young men stroll through Dublin and run into another acquaintance, an American named Farley, who invites them to his yacht. The party grows merrier, and they sing a French marching song as they make their way to the harbor. Once on board, the men proceed to dance and drink as Villona plays the piano. Jimmy makes a speech that his companions loudly applaud, and then the men settle down to play cards. Drunk and giddy, Jimmy plays game after game, losing more and more money. He yearns for the playing to stop, but goes along nevertheless. A final game leaves Routh the champion. Even as the biggest loser alongside Farley, Jimmy‚Äôs spirits never dwindle. He knows he will feel remorse the next day, but assures himself of his happiness just as Villona opens the cabin door and announces that daybreak has come.  Themes  At the beginning of the story, before the characters are introduced, the cars speed through Inchicore, and the writer's own voice remarks that \\"through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its wealth and industry\\" and the Irish onlookers raise \\"the cheer of the gratefully oppressed\\". Motor cars at the early 1900s were generally considered a luxury item, here serving as the symbol of the richer, wider world beyond the confines of backward Ireland. The protagonist Jimmy Doyle seeks to enter this wider cosmopolitan society and carve an equal place for himself, but this ends in failure: he finds himself out of his depth, becomes drunk and unable to keep track of the card game, and ends up losing heavily to the Englishman, Routh, whom he earlier challenged. The story can thus be seen as skeptical about the aspirations of Irish Nationalism to make an independent Ireland the equal of other countries. References *Joyce, James.

The group's first single, \\"Coraz√≥n de Sand√≠a\\", was a summer hit from their first album \\"Mama Funk\\", which comprised sixteen songs and was released in 1995 under the EMI label. Two years later a second big hit \\"Cha cha cha\\" was released as a single, featuring Juan Sativo, a rap artist from Chilean band Tiro de Gracia. Also in 1997 another album with fifteen songs, called \\"La Medicina\\", was released under the EMI Odeon label. This album is recognized by a number of Latin artists as one of the best Latin- American funk works ever. Los Tetas introduced a new member \\"Tata\\", who eventually took the place of Pepino on drums, but also made a big impact on vocals and musical adjustments. Before taking \\"Pepino's\\" place, \\"Tata\\" performs on several percussion arrangements with \\"Los Tetas\\". Bringing the participation of several artists from their local scene, such as Boomer (DJ and Raggamuffin), Zaturno and Juan Sativo from Tiro de Gracia and Anita Tijoux from Makiza, they made a solid and fun album with big influences from James Brown and Parliament funkadelic. Among the songs recorded in this period were \\"Papi... donde esta el Funk\\", \\"Bola Disco\\", \\"La Medicina\\", \\"James Brown\\" and \\"Primavera\\". In 1998 after some disagreements within the band, they dissolved, to reunite again in 1999 with a new formation: Tata (drums), Toly Ramirez Jr. (Bass), C-Funk (Guitar, keyboard and vocals) and Tea Time (scratch and vocals). With this band, they made their fourth album, \\"Independiente\\" containing ten songs. This album was edited and distributed by CAPITALUX Discos label. It wasn't as big a success as former albums, but they survive in the local scene with a lot of live gigs. They also made the transition to the north and begin to make some contacts to work in Mexico and USA. In late 2002 their last album \\"T√≥mala!\\", with 14 songs (including \\"I like\\", \\"Pico Parado\\", \\"Fiesta Funk\\", \\"Underground side\\", \\"Bisex\\" and \\"Sistemas\\"), propelled the band to jump to a lot of countries in Latin America, including Argentina, Per√∫, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela and especially M√©xico, where they found their most success. They also started performing in the USA. Later they shared the stage with Red Hot Chili Peppers in a concert at the Chilean Estadio Nacional. In 2004 they dissolved once again, after one of the co-founder members C-Funk, decided to make the transition to a solo career. The remaining artists of the band changed the name to T-Funk and a few months after to FunkAttack, where they were joined by a new guitarist, Pancho Guitarra. In 2011, after 7 years of being apart, they decided to reunite with their original members: Tea Time (Vocals), C-funk (Guitar), Rulo (Base) and Pepino (Drums). On an interview given to the Chilean newspaper\\"La Tercera\\", they claim to have overcome their differences and furthermore confess to have been unsuccessful at pursuing solo careers. They were preparing a concert in Chile for December 2011.

It was one of a few shows focused on consumer and media awareness for young people. The series was created by producer John Nowlan. He cites Britain's Pocket Money as one of the inspirations for Street Cents. The show has won several Gemini Awards and even an International Emmy for Best Youth Programming or Series. The series was lauded by critics for its efforts to be inclusive and representative of Canada's youth. The theme song for several seasons was Where Does My Money Go? by Thrush Hermit. Like CBC's Marketplace, the show aired without commercial interruption, because the producers did not want the bias of advertising revenue to affect the potential criticism of the advertisers' products and/or services. The show promoted safety and ethics and action while empowering young people. Sponsor logos were briefly seen in the end credits of episodes in a manner akin to public television in the United States. In August 2006, the network airing Street Cents, CBC Television, decided to cancel the series as its target demographic, teens and preteens, have shown a decline of viewership. The last episode aired October 1, 2006 leaving CBC-TV with no programs aimed at young people. Johnathan Torrens has announced that a reboot of the series would be produced called \\"Your Two Cents\\". Pilot In 1988, CBC Halifax created a pilot for the show that would become Street Cents. The working title for the program was Money Penny.  Seasons 1-8 Originally, there were 3 hosts (Jamie Bradley, Benita Ha and Chris Lydon-- Jonathan Torrens replaced Lydon later in Season 1) and a sneaky salesman named Ken Pompadour (played by Brian Heighton) and various pigs and hedgehogs named after coins. Season 1 featured a pink pig named Penny, Season 2 had a pink and black pig named Nickel and Season 3, a pot-bellied pig called Moui (Vietnamese for 'dime') and then hedgehogs One-Bit & Two-Bit. Ken was a weak-willed lackey for the \\"evil\\" corporation BuyCo, which always sold inferior, overpriced and shoddy products, and marketed how great their products were in a stereotypical parody fashion. Every week, Ken would try to sell the viewers and hosts BuyCo products and every week the hosts would foil his scheme. Eventually, Ken's boss (whose face was never seen but was secretly played by host Jamie Bradley) died over Aruba, and Ken got promoted to the head of BuyCo. As boss, Ken's image changed completely, as he was cool, wore all black leather (including pants), had a goatee, and always was able to snap his hand to reveal an item for dramatic effect. He also had his own team of lackeys or \\"yes men\\". Since Brian Heighton left the show, the BuyCo storyline completely disappeared, and the show became less story oriented. Jamie Bradley left the show in 1994 as host and was replaced by Anna Dirksen but made cameo appearances for several years after.  Seasons 9-17  By the ninth season, Street Cents took on a more news-magazine style while maintaining a focus on empowering young people to make their own educated decisions about the media and products they consume. Despite being based in Halifax, the show still maintained its efforts to include all of Canada in the segments it produces by featuring segments from across Canada in each episode. During the final few years, the show has also expanded by featuring segments on various teen issues such as divorce, interracial dating and eating disorders. Common segments *What's your beef? (Viewers send letters, phone calls, and emails to be investigated by the hosts or a guest viewer.) *Fit for the Pit (An inferior product, which the producers believe is not worth paying for, is dramatically tossed into a fiery pit inside the Street Cents studio.) *Me Inc. (A profile about a teenage entrepreneur who works hard to create a niche business that benefits the teenager and is ethical.) *Street Test (Real teenagers/children test out a variety of products blindly to see which one is the best. The most expensive and/or marketed is usually not the best, and is sometimes the worst.) *Streeters (Person on the street interviews with adolescents/teenagers. Usually airs at the beginning and at the end of the show.)

They were formed in response to cholera epidemics and were given powers to control sewers, clean the streets, regulate environmental health risks including slaughterhouses and ensure the proper supply of water to their districts. Local boards were eventually merged with the corporations of municipal boroughs in 1873, or became urban districts in 1894. Pre-Public Health Act 1848 Public Health Act 1848 The first local boards were created under the Public Health Act 1848 (11 & 12 Vict. c.63). The aim of the act was to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing: the supply of water; sewerage; drainage; cleansing; paving, and environmental health regulation under a single local body. The act could be applied to any place in England and Wales except the City of London and some other areas in the Metropolis already under the control of sewer commissioners. The Act was passed by the Liberal government of Lord John Russell, in response to the urging of Edwin Chadwick. This was supported by reports, from the Royal Commission on the Health of Towns (formed in 1843) and local branches of the Health of Towns Association (formed in 1844), of poor and insanitary conditions in many UK cities. =General Board of Health= The act created a General Board of Health as a central authority to administer the act. There were three commissioners:- the president of the board being the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Woods and Forests, Land Revenues, Works and Buildings, the other two members being appointed by warrant. The board was originally to be dissolved after five years, but acts of parliament were passed annually allowing for its continuation. Chadwick was appointed a Commissioner, and the Board was strongly associated with him. In 1852, Edward Gotto was employed to carry out the national General Board of Health Survey. The board finally ceased to exist on 1 September 1858. =Forming a local board of health= Local boards could be formed in two ways: * By a petition of one tenth of the inhabitants rated to relief of the poor in any city, town, borough (municipal or parliamentary), parish or place with a defined boundary not having less than 30 such qualified ratepayers. * By the General Board if the death rate exceeded twenty-three in a thousand in any place. In the latter case a superintending inspector appointed by the General Board would hold an inquiry into the sewerage, drainage, supply of water, state of burial grounds and other matters relating to the sanitary condition of the town, and where necessary define boundaries for the district of the local board. Where the boundaries of a proposed local board's district were the same as an existing local unit, the act was applied by Order in Council. Where a new district was created this was done by provisional order of the General Board, confirmed by parliament. =Membership of a local board= Members of local boards were either: * Selected by the corporations of municipal boroughs * Elected by owners of property and by rate payers Where a local board district coincided with a borough, or was entirely within a borough's limits, all the members were selected by the corporation. Where a district was entirely outside a municipality, all the members were elected. In districts which were partly in and partly outside a borough the board had a mixture of selected and elected members. Selected members did not have to be members of the corporation. Borough mayors were ex officio board members. Those entitled to elect board members could have multiple votes depending on how much property they owned. This ranged from one vote for owners of property worth less than fifty pounds, to six votes for those holding more than 250 pounds of property. It followed that board members were generally wealthy property owners or members of the professions. =Powers of a local board= The powers and duties of a local board of health were enumerated in the act: * Employees: A local board of health was allowed to appoint a number of employees including a surveyor, a clerk, a treasurer and an officer of health (who had to be a qualified doctor). It was compulsory for the Board to appoint an inspector of nuisances (sanitary inspector) to investigate complaints and take action against 'nuisances' (nuisances was a very broad concept encompassing a wide range of environmental public health problems: such as unsanitary dwellings, accumulations of refuse and sewage, smoke dust and smells and industrial emissions, polluted water, noise, adulterated food, slaughterhouse issues etc.). * Sewers: The local board took over ownership of all public sewers in its district. Where private sewers operated for profit, the local board could purchase them. * Street cleansing: The local board was required to clean the streets in its district, removing dust, ashes, rubbish, filth, dung and soil. * Public lavatories: The local board could provide \\"public necessities\\" (as the act called them). * Slaughterhouses: The local board was to regulate slaughterhouses, and was allowed to provide such facilities itself. * Street paving: The local board took over the public streets in the district, and could also require that private streets be paved. * Pleasure grounds: The local boards were allowed to provide and lay out pleasure grounds. * Water Supply: The local board was allowed to supply water, but only if a private company could not provide the service. * Burials: The local board was allowed to provide houses for the reception of the dead prior to burial. They could also apply to the General Board to have an existing graveyard closed. * Land: The local board could purchase land. Local Government Act 1858 The 1848 Act was replaced by the Local Government Act 1858 (21 & 22 Vict. c. 98). The act came into force in all existing local board of health districts on 1 September 1858. The act made some changes to the procedure for constituting a local board and gave them some additional powers. There was also a change in nomenclature: the authorities created by the 1858 act were simply entitled \\"local boards\\" and their areas as \\"local government districts\\". =The Local Government Act Office and the Local Government Board= When the General Board of Health was abolished in 1858 its responsibilities in respect of local government passed to the Secretary of State of the Home Department, in whose department a Local Government Act Office was formed to administer the local boards. In 1871 a separate agency was again formed entitled the Local Government Board, with a President who was frequently a Cabinet member. The Local Government Board also took over the duties of the Poor Law Board. =Constituting local boards= The procedure for adopting the act and constituting a local board was laid out in sections 12 ‚Äì 17 of the act, and was similar to that in the 1848 act. Changes made included: * Improvement commissioners could adopt the act for their district, the board of commissioners becoming in addition the local board. * Petitions from ten per cent of the ratepayers of places other than those with a \\"known or defined boundary\\" to adopt the act were now made to the Secretary of State. If one in twenty ratepayers objected to the formation of a local board they now had the right to petition against it. * The power to create a local board where there was excess mortality was abolished. The method of electing members of the board remained the same, although existing or new boards could now be divided into wards. =Additional powers= The Town Police Clauses Act 1847 had included model clauses for the government of towns which could be adopted in all or in part by existing borough corporations, local boards of health or improvement commissioners. The application of these was very uneven, so they were incorporated into the 1858 act, all local boards gaining these powers. Areas covered by the clauses were: * Removal of obstructions and nuisances in the street * Fires and fire prevention * Provision and control of places of public resort * Regulation of hackney carriages * Provision of public bathing houses * Naming streets and numbering houses * Improving the line of streets * Removal of ruinous or dangerous buildings * Provision of public clocks The local board also took over any lamps, lamp posts and gas posts provided by the Lighting and Watching Act 1833, and was given a new power to provide a market place where one was required or inadequate. Number of local boards The number of local boards peaked at 721 in 1873. In that year the Public Health Act 1872 merged local boards into municipal boroughs and improvement commissioners where they shared the same district. 419 of the local boards had been formed under the Public Health Act 1848, the remaining 302 under the Local Government Act 1858. The number of local boards was inflated in 1862‚Äì63, as communities adopted the act in order to avoid being grouped into highway districts under the Highways Act 1862. Many of these local government districts had a population of fewer than 500, and several fewer than 100. Further legislation was passed in 1863 to limit the population of a new local government district to 3,000 or more. Some of these small authorities survived as urban districts until the county review orders of the 1930s. Sanitary districts and urban districts The Public Health Act 1875 designated local government districts as urban sanitary districts, with the local board becoming the urban sanitary authority. The titles of the district and board did not change however, the local board assuming extra duties as a sanitary authority. Local boards and local government districts were finally abolished by the Local Government Act 1894, when all urban sanitary districts became urban districts. A new urban district council was to govern the district. The new council was to be directly elected by all those entitled to voted in parliamentary elections, replacing the weighted property voting system used for local boards.

The Timber Culture Act was passed by Congress on March 3 of that year. This act allowed homesteaders to acquire 160 acres of land by planting 40 acres of trees. At the end of eight years from the date of entry, the settler could make final proof if the necessary conditions had been fulfilled. Five additional years were allowed to make proof, or a total of thirteen years from the date of entry. The claimant had to prove that the trees had been planted and cultivated and that not less than 675 living trees per acre had survived. An affidavit or \\"timber culture proof\\" had to be completed by the claimant and two witnesses before the final certificate and patents were issued.

The terms microenterprise and microbusiness have the same meaning, though traditionally when referring to a small business financed by microcredit the term microenterprise is often used. Similarly, when referring to a small, usually legal business that is not financed by microcredit, the term microbusiness (or micro-business) is often used. Internationally, most microenterprises are family businesses employing one or two persons. Most microenterprise owners are primarily interested in earning a living to support themselves and their families. They only grow the business when something in their lives changes and they need to generate a larger income. According to information found on the Census.gov website, microenterprises make up 95% of the 28 million US companies tracked by the census.  History of the concept  The concepts of micro-enterprise and microfinance were pioneered in 1976 by Nobel Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bank of the Rural), in Bangladesh. The bank was established for the purpose of making small loans to the poor ‚àí predominantly women ‚Äì to help them obtain economic self-sufficiency. The fundamental principle behind the Grameen Bank is that credit is a human right. This strategy was highly effective as the bank grew exponentially; from fewer than 15,000 borrowers in 1980, Grameen Bank had 2.34 million members by 1998, 7.67 million at the end of 2008, 97% of whom are women, and 9.4 million today.  Global definitions  The term micro- enterprise or microbusiness refers to different entities and sectors depending on the country. = India = In India, all the manufacturing and service enterprises having investment \\"Not more than Rs 1 crore\\" and Annual Turnover \\"not more than Rs 5 crore\\" come under this category. = Australia = In Australia, the term refers to a business bigger than a single owner-operator, but having up to 5 employees.Australia Post, How small businesses attract and retain business, accessed 2 June 2016 = European Union = The European Union (EU) defines \\"micro-enterprises\\" as those that meet two of the following three criteria and do not fail to do so for at least 10 years: * fewer than 10 employees * balance sheet total below EUR 2 million * turnover below EUR 2 million . = Philippines = = United Kingdom = The Office for National Statistics and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy both maintain statistical recordsONS business size, activity and location statistics. Unlike the EU definitions, there are no turnover or balance sheet limits to the UK micro-business definition. UK Government Business Population estimates. which officially classify businesses of 1‚Äì9 employees as being micro-businesses. The House of Commons Library maintains a briefing note pulling together these statistical sources. In May 2013 David Young, Baron Young of Graham published a report for government on supporting micro-business growth in the UK, \\"Growing your business: a report on growing micro businesses\\". = United States = In the United States, a different model is used, but the stated goals and core values are similar. Here, a micro- enterprise is defined as a business with five or fewer employees. Many of these businesses have no employees other than the self-employed owners. Additionally, such micro-enterprises generally need less than $35,000 in loan capital and do not have access to the conventional commercial banking sector. The basis of micro-enterprise in the U.S. is entrepreneurship, recognizing a fundamental right of people to apply their individual talents, creativity and hard work to better their lives. Micro-enterprise programs, therefore, are built around the philosophy that the unique ideas and skills of entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs should be provided business assistance and small amounts of credit to support the development or start-up of a small business, primarily through the U.S. Small Business Administration. Most organizations in the field also focus their services on those microentrepreneurs who, as defined by federal government standards, are low-to-moderate income. By definition, most of these entrepreneurs are minorities, recent immigrants, women, disabled or for other reasons have special challenges that reduce their ability to access traditional credit and other services.  Contributions to the larger economy  Microenterprises are said to add value to a country's economy by creating jobs, enhancing income, strengthening purchasing power, lowering costs and adding business convenience.  Financing  Because microenterprises typically have little to no access to the commercial banking sector, they often rely on \\"micro-loans\\" or microcredit in order to be financed. Microfinance institutions often finance these small loans, particularly in the Third World. Those who startup microenterprises are usually referred to as entrepreneurs. Micro-loans are a way for organizations and entrepreneurs to make small loans to those in poverty often in third world countries. The term \\"micro-loans\\" is more commonly referred to as Microcredit.  Government programs  Government support for microenterprises varies from country to country. Plan for Achieving Self Support is a program offered by the United States Social Security Administration (or SSA) to encourage persons that are Supplemental Security Income (or SSI) eligible who are disabled to set aside moneys for various reasons: training, schooling and funding microenterprise as a Work Goal. The NEIS (New Enterprise Initiative Scheme) is a government program in Australia, which assists unemployed people to start their own businesses. Although it is not specifically for micro-businesses, many if not most businesses started in this program are micro-businesses (in the senses of having limited capital, and only one person involved in the business).  Recent development in the United States  The microenterprise field has a twenty-year history in the United States. While the term \\"microenterprise\\" was in common use internationally by the late 1970s, it came into domestic use within the United States about a decade later. Traditionally, the business sector had been categorized into three groups: large, medium, and small. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as having up to 500 employees. In 1991, the SBA recognized microenterprise as a separate or distinct category of business. Microloans may be used for general business expenses such as, working capital and tangible assets, such as inventory, furniture, and equipment. They cannot be used to pay the microbusiness owner, to purchase real-estate, pay existing debt, or for non-qualifying not-for-profit entities. During the 1990s, the microenterprise field grew rapidly in the United States. Starting with a small number of non-profit organizations testing developing country models, the field now has service providers in every state, a national trade association (AEO), a growing number of state-level associations and financing intermediaries, and several research and policy organizations. The Aspen Institute and FIELD (Microenterprise Fund for Innovation, Effectiveness, Learning and Dissemination) has collected data on the organizations in the field since 1992. The first directory, in 1992, listed 108 organizations that identified themselves as working in the field. By 2010 this number had grown to over 800 organizations that provide direct services to entrepreneurs‚Äîeither microfinancing or business development services. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI's), particularly Community Development Loan Funds frequently offer loan capital for microenterprises in the United States. Anthony Hilb, author of Make Money with a Microbusiness, and founder of microbusinessowners.com stated, \\"Microbusinesses have existed since people first exchanged goods and services in their communities. Today, microbusinesses can have a much larger impact; products and services can be exchanged at previously unimagined volumes, distances, and speeds. Credit here is due to advancements in technology. With the internet, apps, and other technologies available (often for free), microbusinesses will continue to explode in popularity.\\"  In developing countries  A young Syrian refugee holds a basket that she decorated for sale. Making and selling small crafts or clothes is a common form of micro-business for women. In developing countries, microenterprises constitute the vast majority of the small business sector‚Äîa result of the relative lack of formal sector jobs available for the poor. Microenterprises in developing countries, then, tend to be the most frequent form/size of business. As explained by Aneel Karnani: > Most microcredit clients are not microentrepreneurs by choice. They would > gladly take a factory job at reasonable wages if it were available. We > should not romanticize the idea of the \\"poor as entrepreneurs.\\" The > International Labour Organization (ILO) uses a more appropriate term for > these people: \\"own-account workers.\\" Paper to Pearls is another example of a micro-enterprise program, which is based in the United States, but works with women in northern Uganda. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Vietnam country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to microcredit for taking up small- scale farm activities.RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010. In Poland, in 2012, there were 1.7 million micro-enterprises, employing 3.5 million persons.  Women in the Dominican Republic  In the Dominican Republic, a nationwide survey conducted in 1992 revealed that 330,000 micro and small enterprises created employment for 26 percent of the economically active population.Cabal,Miguel. 1992. Microempresasy pequenas empresase n la Repdblica Dominicana: Resultadados de una encuesta nacional. Santo Domingo: Fondomicro. Furthermore, a significant portion of this is represented by women (38 percent). It is argued that the households of women are targeted more directly by microenterprise support services because women tend to devote more of their income to their households, than do men.Grasmuck, Sherri, and Rosario Espinal. 2000. Market Success or Female Autonomy? Income, Ideology, and Empowerment among Microentrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic. Gender and Society 14 (2):231‚Äì255. Therefore, it is recommended that microenterprise training programs be less gender-neutral and should be diversified to address the central challenges of women's businesses.Grasmuck, Sherri, and Rosario Espinal. 2000.

Originally trained in psychology, Fortes employed the notion of the \\"person\\" into his structural-functional analyses of kinship, the family, and ancestor worship setting a standard for studies on African social organization. His celebrated book, Oedipus and Job in West African Religion (1959), fused his two interests and set a standard for comparative ethnology. He also wrote extensively on issues of the first born, kingship, and divination. Life Fortes received his anthropological training from Charles Gabriel Seligman at the London School of Economics. Fortes also trained with Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski and Raymond Firth. Along with contemporaries A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, Sir Edmund Leach, Audrey Richards, and Lucy Mair, Fortes held strong functionalist views that insisted upon empirical evidence in order to generate analyses of society. His volume with E. E. Evans-Pritchard, African Political Systems (1940) established the principles of segmentation and balanced opposition, which were to become the hallmarks of African political anthropology. Despite his work in Francophone West Africa, Fortes' work on political systems was influential to other British anthropologists, especially Max Gluckman and played a role in shaping what became known as the Manchester school of social anthropology, which emphasized the problems of working in colonial Central Africa. Fortes spent much of his career as a Reader at the University of Cambridge and was the William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology there from 1950-1973. In 1963, Fortes delivered the inaugural Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture at the University of Rochester, considered by many to be the most important annual lecture series in the field of Anthropology.

When Alexander captured Caria, he granted Ada to be the ruler of the whole region.Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander, ¬ß1.23.8 The city was apparently renamed \\"Alexandria by the Latmos\\" () shortly afterwards, and was recorded as thus by Stephanus of Byzantium, although sources disagree as to the exact location of the settlement of that name. The prior name of Alinda was restored by 81 BC at the latest. It appears as \\"Alinda\\" in Ptolemy's Geographia (Book V, ch. 2) of the 2nd century AD. Alinda remained an important commercial city, minting its own coins from the third century BC to the 3rd century AD. Stephanus records that the city had a temple of Apollo containing a statue of Aphrodite by Praxiteles. Alinda has a necropolis of Carian tombs and has been partially excavated. Alinda also had a major water system including a Roman aqueduct, a nearly-intact market place, a 5,000-seat Roman amphitheater in relatively good condition, and remains of numerous temples and sarcophagi.  Ecclesiastical history  Alinda appears on Byzantine lists of bishoprics. It was a suffragan of the Metropolitan of Stauropolis, the capital of the Roman province of Caria, but was to fade. = Residential Bishops= (incomplete) *Promachios fl.451Fergus Millar, A Greek Roman Empire: Power and Belief under Theodosius II (408‚Äì450) (University of California Press, 2006) p100. *John fl.451Richard Price, Michael Gaddis, The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, Volume 1 (Liverpool University Press, 1 Jan. 2005) p451 *Theodoretus fl.536Biographical Index of the Middle Ages / Biographischer Index des Mittelalters / Index Biographique du Moyen-√Çge (Walter de Gruyter,2008) p1068. = Titular Bishopric = It was nominally restored as a Latin titular see of the Roman Catholic Church but has been vacant since the death of the last bishop in 1976, having had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank : * Alexandre-Louis-Victor-Aim√© Le Roy, Holy Ghost Fathers (C.S.Sp.)

In March 2009, in a commentary in the Washington Times, Chapin wrote of the risks of negotiating with Iran and the possibilities of Iran launching an electromagnetic pulse weapon against the United States. Hoping to \\"prevent a looming nuclear doomsday,\\" Chapin proposed a two part plan: :(1) Urgently initiate a massive buildup of the conventional weaponry needed to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities and wipe out its retaliatory capabilities as well as arm Israel to the teeth. Also station Aegis anti-missile ships along our coasts while beefing up homeland security and taking steps to mitigate the effects of an EMP attack.

Barrett titled \\"Shell Game\\" reported that Chapin and his wife Elizabeth are accused of spending the money raised by their non-profit organizations to fund their own lifestyles, vehicles, and real estate investments‚Äîrather than to benefit troops or wounded veterans at the 97% efficiency rate that the charity claims. Other Forbes reporting in regard to the HHV organization claims that of every dollar given, only nine cents went to therapeutic arts-and-crafts kits for wounded GIs (a primary purpose of the charity), while another five cents went towards associated overhead and for counselors to visit hospitals and nursing homes. Forty-seven cents of spending was for direct-mail expenses, with the remainder going for the salaries of the charity staff, etc. On November 9, 2007, ABC News reported that Chapin and his wife, as founders and employees of the charitable organization, Help Hospitalized Veterans, paid themselves more than half a million dollars a year in salary. The American Institute of Philanthropy claims that of the $70 million that HHV received in contributions last year, only 31% went to the charitable cause, leading to a grade of \\"F\\" from the watchdog group. According to Daniel Borochoff, the president of AIP, \\"[Chapin] is a charity entrepreneur. He's very good at setting up charities that don't do so much charitable but bring in lots, lots of money.\\" AIP followed up on Chapin with an article in its December 2010 issue of the Charity Rating Guide & Watchdog Report.

Forbes also noted at this time that a lawsuit against two former employees of Coalition to Salute America's Heroes Foundation, Raymond and John Clifford, had been reinstated. Both sides were then involved in pre-trial activities. \\"The lawsuit says the Cliffords, fired by Chapin in 2007, took 'confidential financial information' and made disparaging remarks about the coalition to reporters. The nonprofit seeks unspecified money damages and a court order barring further disclosures. The Cliffords assert a First Amendment right to speak out and say they've done nothing wrong.\\" In 2010, looking at the latest 2008 figures, Forbes again found high fund-raising expenses relative to actual program work at the Coalition. Of \\"$26.2 million spent for calendar year 2008, ... the Coalition by its own accounting spent just $5.7 million--22 cents of every dollar--on its two signature programs.\\" Looking at Chapin's own financial gain and management position, Forbes found he \\"received total compensation of $364,000 from [HHV] but reported drawing no pay from the other organizations.

Built as a parish church in 1894‚Äì1895, it became the pro-cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1944 when pro-cathedral status was removed from St Peter's, Qu'Appelle, in the eponymous former see city which had become moribund. In 1973, when it had become clear that the once-planned grand cathedral for Regina ‚Äî at the corner of Broad Street and College Avenue ‚Äî was no longer a feasible project, its status was raised to that of cathedral. Configuration St Paul's Cathedral, Regina, interior The church seats approximately 300 people. It is in the approved Cambridge Camden Society configuration with gable roof in keeping with the moderately high church sensibilities of the diocese of Qu'Appelle, albeit of extremely modest appearance both inside and out, reflecting the extreme numerical and financial minority status of Anglicanism in Western Canada and the tendency for moneyed benefactors to be of more mainstream denominational allegiance. There is a Lady Chapel to the liturgical and geographical south of the chancel, and a columbarium in the crypt. The parish dates from the original establishment of the town of Regina in 1882, when the current church site was purchased. In 1883, a wooden frame building, measuring 50 by 24 feet, was opened and in 1894‚Äì1895, the present brick and fieldstone church was built. A chancel and transepts were added in 1905‚Äì06. It is the oldest church building in Regina still in use.Regina Leader-Post, August 1, 1970. Historic Architecture of Saskatchewan. Regina: Focus Publishing, Saskatchewan Association of Architects, 1986. The organ console was, until May 1974, immediately north (both geographically and theologically) of the wall between the chancel and the chapel; the choir west of the altar; the organ pipes to the north of the chancel, behind the pulpit. The new organ pipes were in the north transept, above the choir, with the console at the southwest corner. The console and choir have been variously relocated since then. It has a curious history as: # originally a vastly secondary parishional site when the diocese was centred elsewhere in the then-district of the North-West (sic) Territories; # a temporary cathedral site prior to the building of a more substantial building on the diocesan complex on the southeast of Broad Street and College Avenue; and # ultimately itself designated the cathedral when it had become accepted that previous plans were not feasible to build a substantial cathedral on the Diocese of Qu'Appelle's property at the corner of College Avenue and Broad Street.

It was and remains considerably more \\"high church\\" in interior adornment than its successor in Regina, although by necessity maintained at minimum expense.In anticipation of its presumed eventual urban importance the Anglican ecclesiastical province of Ruperts Land designated the village of Qu'Appelle, some 30 miles east of the site which became Regina, now (what fragment of it still remains) on the Trans-Canada Highway, as the cathedral city of the new diocese of Qu'Appelle, although there was also an element of the churchmanship in St. Paul's Regina at a time when the town of Qu'Appelle's anticipated significance was already passing: \\"Opposition by the congregation of St. Paul‚Äôs, Regina, to candles on the altar led Anson to ask the people of St. Peter‚Äôs, Qu‚ÄôAppelle to become the pro-cathedral.\\"Trevor Powell, \\"Building ‚Äòa Holy Catholic Church‚Äô on the Prairies.\\" http://quappelle.anglican.ca/index.php/history/67-building-holy-catholic- church Viewed November 27, 2012. The Diocese of Qu'Appelle still retains that name, though the historic significance of the town's parish church other than as a subsidiary associate-congregation of the parish of Indian Head is long past. The once significant town was doomed by the Lieutenant-Governor Edgar Dewdney acquiring substantial land ownership at the site Pile-of-Bones, soon re-named Regina, and deeming it the capital of the North-West Territories (as then spelled), as early as 1883. Nevertheless, optimism persisted as to the continuing significance of the town of Qu'Appelle and the old pro-cathedral was built in 1885. St Paul's, Regina supplanted St Peter's, Qu'Appelle as the pro-cathedral of the diocese in 1944. The name \\"Qu'Appelle\\" of course retains actual significance as to the Qu'Appelle Valley. St Paul's, Regina, circa 1895. Note the long-demolished rectory, to the north of the church.Obviously once Regina was named territorial headquarters and, in 1905, provincial capital, it made more sense for the cathedral city to be the capital city of the civil province, though cathedral \\"cities\\" that are actually mere villages or towns are far from a rarity: see Our Lady of Assumption Co-Cathedral (Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan) and for that matter, say, Rochester Cathedral in England. (The diocese in fact was originally precisely coterminous with the District of Assiniboia of the North-West Territories, though in the 1970s a strip of the diocese which since the creation of the civil provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta had lain over the Alberta provincial boundary was ceded to the diocese of Calgary.)

The Saskatchewan provincial legislative building is in the lower left hand corner.Beginning in the 1890s the indicia of diocesan metropolitan status were incrementally removed from Qu'Appelle, first to Indian Head and then Regina where the de facto diocesan administrative headquarters, with Bishops Court, the St Chad's theological college and the Qu'Appelle Diocesan School were established by the beginning of the 20th century. Bishop's Court and the diocesan administrative bureaucracy having been removed first to Indian Head in the 1890s and then Regina at the beginning of the twentieth century, pro- cathedral status was ultimately removed from St Peter's, Qu'Appelle and conferred on St Paul's, Regina in 1944: at that time the diocesan property at the corner of Broad Street and College Avenue was planned ultimately to contain a substantial cathedral, whose anticipated site is still outlined in caragana hedges and whose liturgical west front faced the intersection to the northwest. By 1974 fiscal and demographic realities‚ÄîAnglicans are a tiny minority of the population of southern Saskatchewan‚Äîhad dispelled that fantasy and St Paul's was formally elevated to cathedral status.

St Paul's as a cathedral church St Paul's Cathedral, Regina, interior in December, decorated for Christmas The Diocese of Qu'Appelle owned a substantial property in Regina on College Avenue at Broad Street which has now been sold to the civil province of Saskatchewan in order that the diocese finally achieve financial independence, it originally having been financially underwritten by the Church of England Diocese of Lichfield as a mission diocese, though Lichfield quickly became bored with this responsibility and gave it clearly to be understood that it expected Qu'Appelle to become self- sustaining.

Of some historical interest is the ambitious cathedral site laid out diagonally at the corner of Broad Street and College Avenue, still clearly outlined in hedges.

With its 29 (or 30, depending on how one designates the Parishes of the British Columbia Central Interior, the former Diocese of Cariboo) it may be somewhat top-heavy with episcopacy given its small numbers outside Ontario and the Maritimes.

Organ, north transept, first played May 4, 1974 Organ, north transept By 1973 it was apparent that the diocese could never be self-supporting other than by alienating its only substantial real estate and that the original ambition to build a sizable cathedral in Regina could never be realised. St Paul's was then formally upgraded to cathedral status and a satisfactory 2-manual Casavant Fr√®res organ built under then-organist Donald M. Kendrick and Dean James Allan,Himself subsequently a bishop in the diocese of Keewatin, based in Kenora, Ontario. a gift of the Whitmore family of $20,000. The new Casavant organ was first played on the first Sunday of May 1974 when the Rev. Michael Peers arrived from Winnipeg to replace James Allan as dean. The previous organ pipes had been located north of the chancel with the console on the south within the chancel, the instrument at the southeast corner of the chancel, just inside the doorway into the south chapel. The choir members were placed on the north and south of the chancel, west of the altar. The pipes of the 1974 organ are above the north transept and the console has been variously positioned in the north and south transepts. The original organ chamber behind the pulpit has been converted to a sacristy and a painting hangs where pipes were once visible. The church basement has been substantially enlarged and converted to a Buddhist-style columbariam, with niches for cremated ashes arrayed post office-style around the perimeter: According to the cathedral's website, \\"...[T]he Columbarium is a permanent part of the church structure and serves as sanctuary for the cremated remains of individuals and families.

St Paul's in the wider ecclesiastical and secular community Michael Peers at St. Paul's Dean's residence in Regina after election as Bishop of Qu'Appelle The cathedral has been something of a launching pad for ecclesiastical and artistic careers: Michael Coleman, Fredric Jackson and Duncan Wallace, past bishops of Qu'Appelle, had previously been deans of Qu'Appelle and rectors of St Paul's; James Allan was dean of Qu'Appelle before his election as bishop of Keewatin; Michael Peers, later bishop and archbishop of Qu'Appelle (1977‚Äì86) and primate of Canada (1986‚Äì2004) was dean from 1974 to 1977. Donald M. Kendrick of Calgary, Alberta, subsequently conductor of the Bach-Elgar Choir in Hamilton, Ontario and of the faculty of California State University, Sacramento, was organist and choirmaster during the mid-1970s; during his tenure at St Paul's and the then-University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus, St Paul's was the centre of liturgical music in Regina, and a generation of Canadian choral and keyboard musicians was trained and continue to contribute to Canadian and world music. It was at Mr Kendrick's instance, with the enthusiastic support of Dean Allan and the financial underwriting by the Whitmore family, that the current small but fine Casavant Fr√®res organ was installed in north transept of the cathedral in May 1974.

Military career Born in Erracht, near Banavie in Lochaber, Cameron was the eldest son of Donald Cameron of Erracht and Marjorie, daughter of MacLean of Drimmin, who was killed at the Battle of Culloden. It was not until he was 4 years old that he first met his father. He joined the army as a volunteer and served in North America. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War Cameron was captured by American colonists in 1775 and imprisoned for two years in Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. He returned to Scotland in 1784. After war was declared with revolutionary France in 1793 Cameron raised the 79th Regiment of Foot and was accepted as its Colonel (although his army rank still appears to be no more than Major at this pointArmy Lists). He commanded the regiment when it joined the forces of the Duke of York in the Flanders Campaign 1794, and during the retreat through Holland 1795. From 1795-1797 the regiment was in the West Indies and served at Martinique. Cameron was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel in 1796. Devastated by fever the 79th was eventually withdrawn from the West Indies and rebuilt in Guernsey 1798. Cameron again served under York in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799. The 79th was in garrison in Houat in 1800, then joined Abercromby's expedition to Egypt and Minorca in 1801. A 2nd battalion was raised in 1804. Cameron was confirmed as Colonel 79th Foot on 1 January 1805. In 1807 he led his regiment in the expedition against Copenhagen under Cathcart.

An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, it was co-written and directed by Alan Parker, and stars Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, and Michael Legge, the latter three playing the Young, Middle, and Older Frank McCourt, respectively. Plot Angela's Ashes tells the story of Frank McCourt and his childhood after his family are forced to move from the United States back to Ireland because of financial difficulties and family problems caused by his father's alcoholism. The film chronicles young McCourt's life in Limerick, Ireland, during his childhood in the 1930s and 1940s, the difficulties that arose, and Frank's way of earning enough money to return to the land of his dreams: America. The McCourt family return to Limerick after the death of Frank's younger sister, Margaret. Shortly after their arrival one of the twin brothers, Oliver dies, within a few weeks, so does his twin Eugene. Frank's father, Malachy Sr., is unable to keep a job, and squanders the family's money on alcohol. He is too proud to beg or to collect much needed coal from the streets. Angela, Frank's mother is forced to go to charitable organisations to beg for furniture whilst Malachy Sr. signs up for the dole. The McCourt family lives in a small house where the entire street shares one lavatory that just happens to be outside the McCourts front door. Frank and Malachy Jr. come home one day to find that the downstairs of the home has badly flooded. Upstairs, a new brother, Michael, has been born and Frank is told that the angel brought him. Malachy Sr. berates Angela for begging for clothes and boots for her children and tries to prove his worth as a husband and father. The boys are tormented in school for their ratty clothing and shoes and Frank even goes so far as to take his off and hide them. As Frank's teacher remarks, there are boys in the class who have no shoes at all and they should not take pleasure in each others misfortunes. Malachy Sr. looks for a job everyday but due to his \\"funny manner\\" and northern accent he is unsuccessful. Around Easter Malachy Sr. receives his first job in Limerick, at the cement factory. Unfortunately, the money he earns is spent in the pubs rather than on food for his family. Malachy Sr., in a particularly poignant scene arrives home singing old songs about Ireland. He gets the boys out of bed and makes them promise to die for Ireland, for the \\"Friday penny\\". He oversleeps and loses his job the next day. The boys in school are taught how to take communion bread/wafers. Frank's friend Mikey is an \\"expert\\" on \\"all things dirty\\", specifically a warped idea of the female anatomy. The boys are taken to church in their school classes and are each told to go in for a first confession. Frank sleeps in on the day of his first communion and his grandmother reacts harshly, as she tries to rectify the situation, criticising Frank and Malachy Sr. Frank is eager to \\"make the collection\\", an act in which children who've just had their first communion wander around the town in their new communion clothes and are given sweets and money by their neighbours. Franks grandmother takes the family back to her house for a communion breakfast but Frank vomits up the food. His grandmother takes Frank back to the church to confess his sins. Mikey, without a collection still wants to celebrate. He manages to sneak into the cinema. His parents sign Frank up for Irish dancing, which he predictably hates. He skips the dancing lessons and instead goes to the cinema, unknown to his parents. He then goes home and makes up dances for his parents.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 51% based on reviews from 86 critics.

On Metacritic the film has a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Michael Legge was praised for his portrayal of the adolescent Frank. In particular, he was said to excel in his role as an innocent teenager growing up with typical coming of age rites involving sexuality, maturity and peer pressure in a Catholic Irish setting. Differences from the book * In the book, the opening paragraph describes Angela's upbringing. It tells how Angela's brother Pat became developmentally disabled by being dropped on the ground by Angela's father throwing him in the air, and that Angela's pregnant mother told him to leave, so he \\"ran out the door and didn't stop till he got to Australia\\". The film omits this. * In the film, when Angela suggests naming Frank's new brother Alphonsus, and Frank exclaims that it's a stupid name, Aggie smacks the back of Frank's head. In the book, Angela slaps Frank across the face so hard he reels backwards. * In the film, Frank says that Irish dancers look like they have metal rods up their arses, but in the book it is Frank's father who says that. * The end of the film shows Frank sailing past the Statue of Liberty as he arrives in New York City.

They currently compete in and play their home matches at Victory Park. The club was founded as a rugby union club in 1875 but switched to football in 1883. They have reached the FA Cup second round twice, in 1986‚Äì87 and 1990‚Äì91. Their best performance in the FA Trophy was in 1995‚Äì96 when they reached the semi-finals. The club's home colours are black and white stripes, hence the nickname The Magpies.http://www.mossleyweb.com/Clubs2007~08/ClubsChorley.htm History =19th century= 250px Chorley Football Club was formed in 1883 after switching from rugby to football.http://chorley.sponsor- link.tv/content.php?page=2%20history In 1875 Chorley Football Club began partly as the brainchild of one Major John Lawrence, a Wigan player who had conceived the idea a year earlier. The inauguration took place on 15 October in the now demolished Anchor Inn in Market Street, Chorley. At that gathering Major Lawrence was elected the club's first captain. Henry Hibbert, who was to become one of the most famous figures ever connected with the town as Member of Parliament for Chorley,http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/sir-henry- hibbert took on the role of secretary. James Lawrence became the club treasurer.\\"\\"In Black & White\\"\\" Chorley Football Club's Official History by John F. Newman. After playing rugby for seven years, pressure was on Chorley to switch to playing football instead, and in 1883 the switch was made. Chorley joined the Lancashire Junior League in 1889, and the following year became a member of the Lancashire Alliance, a league which they were crowned champions of in 1892‚Äì93 and runners-up in 1893‚Äì94.http://chorley.sponsor- link.tv/content.php?page=4%20league In 1894 Chorley joined the Lancashire League, becoming champions twice in 1896‚Äì97 and 1898‚Äì99. The Lancashire Junior Cup came to Chorley in 1894, nine years after the trophy's institution, and their win was the first of a record number of successes for the Magpies. They beat Clitheroe 3‚Äì2 in a replayed final at Ewood Park, Blackburn after a 2‚Äì2 draw. Chorley bid farewell to the Lancashire Alliance at the end of the 1893‚Äì94 season and joined the Lancashire League, winning the championship in 1896‚Äì97 which also saw them sell former Bolton Wanderers attacker Jack Lyden to Wolverhampton Wanderers for ¬£100 (around ¬£6,000 in today's money), a substantial fee for a non-league player considering that this was eight years prior to the first ¬£1,000 transfer deal. Chorley won another championship in 1898‚Äì99, but was clouded by a notice to quit their Dole Lane Ground, and the loss of captain Johnny Parker, who had broken his leg. In May 1899 Chorley applied to join the Football League's Second Division, coming sixth in voting, with the top two being elected. =20th century= 250px 250px September 1901 saw Chorley move to the Rangletts Ground, taking even the grandstand and hoardings, and 1903 saw the Lancashire League restructured as the Lancashire Combination, which was extended in size to encompass two divisions, A and B, with Chorley playing in the Combination B Division. Life at the Rangletts Ground was short lived, with Chorley being evicted in 1904, and relocated to nearby St. George's Park. The 1904‚Äì05 season saw Chorley finish their highest position ‚Äì fifth ‚Äì for six years. Chorley suffered their worst season in 1914‚Äì15, finishing bottom of the league, but the outbreak of the First World War saved them from relegation, for the Combination, like the Football League, suspended its competitions in 1915. During the war Chorley joined the Northern Division but due to difficulties in raising a team they were disbanded early in 1916. Chorley did not have a team for the next two seasons, but in August 1918 formed a side for friendly matches. After the re-formation of the Combination S. Heaton became the club chairman, Charlie Holgate the secretary, and T.J. \\"Dod\\" Gaskell the treasurer. Chorley took their place in the reassembled Combination (there was only one division by now) with what proved to be one of their finest-ever teams. The 1920s were to bring a phrase of glory and the team was among the honours for ten successive seasons. But the beginning of one era coincided with the end of another. Just 14 years after playing their first home game at St. Georges Park, Chorley announced in August 1919 that they had acquired a new ground. It was to come into use the following year and was to be a truly permanent home. The ground, situated in Duke Street and adjoining Rangletts Recreation Ground, a former Magpie base, was named Victory Park to commemorate the end of the war. Chorley did not achieve notable success in any league until the 1919‚Äì20 season when they were crowned champions of the Lancashire Combination First Division, a league they won a total of eleven times between 1919 and 1964. In 1968‚Äì69 Chorley were one of the founder members of the Northern Premier League, left at the end of the season, and rejoined in the 1970‚Äì71 season.http://www.fchd.info/CHORLEY.HTM Chorley joined the Cheshire League in the 1972‚Äì73 season, finishing as runners-up in 1975‚Äì76, and another two times in 1976‚Äì77 and 1981‚Äì82. Chorley rejoined the Northern Premier League in 1982‚Äì83, and became champions in 1987‚Äì88, which saw them promoted to the Football Conference ‚Äì the fifth tier of the English football league system. Chorley spent two seasons in the Conference before being relegated back to the Northern Premier League in 1990‚Äì91. =21st century= Chorley spent the first ten years of the 21st century in the Northern Premier League Division 1, the 8th tier of English Football (divided into the Northern Premier League North and Northern Premier League South in 2007). They almost invariably finished each season in the bottom half of the league table during this period, though they did finish fifth at the end of the 2002-03 season and qualified for the promotion play- offs, losing to Radcliffe Borough in the final. Chorley achieved promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division at the end of the 2010-11 season, finishing 3rd and going on to beat AFC Fylde 2-0 in the play-off final. After spending three seasons in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, Chorley achieved a further promotion as 2013-14 league champions, moving up to the Conference North (6th tier of English Football). In their first season in the Conference North, Chorley came close to achieving consecutive promotions when they finished fourth and reached the promotion play-off final, but lost 3-2 to Guiseley. At the end of that season manager Garry Flitcroft stepped down from his post and was replaced by assistant manager, Matt Jansen. The Football Conference was renamed as the National League at the start of the 2015-16 season and Chorley finished eighth in the National League North. The following season they again reached the play-off final, losing 2-1 to FC Halifax Town after extra-time. The 2017-18 season saw Chorley reach the promotion play-offs yet again, but they were beaten 2-1 by Harrogate Town in the semi-finals. Before the beginning of the 2018-19 season manager Matt Jansen left his post and was replaced by his assistant, Jamie Vermiglio Chorley got off to a flying start in the 2018-19 season, winning their first seven league matches and remaining unbeaten for their first twelve. They spent the majority of the season at the top of the table, but were overtaken right at the end by Stockport County, who won the title by one point, with Chorley finishing second. In their play-off semi-final, with the score 1-1 after extra-time, Chorley beat Altrincham 3-1 on penalties. The score in the final between Chorley and Spennymoor Town, at Victory Park, Chorley, was 0-0 after 90 minutes. Chorley went 1-0 up in extra-time but Spennymoor quickly equalised and so the contest went to a penalty shoot-out, which Chorley won 4-3, thereby achieving promotion to the National League, the 5th tier of English Football. Financial irregularities In October 2011 a Chorley F.C. official was arrested and bailed on suspicion of stealing over ¬£50,000 from the club.http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/9288146.Chorley_FC_official_bailed_in_theft_probe/ As a result of this the club was forced to delay payment to players and launched a campaign to save the club with the help of local businesses.http://www.chorley-guardian.co.uk/news/local/battle-to-save- chorley-football-club-1-4035091 In March 2013 Ian Daniels pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to charges relating to the theft from the club.

Both men received custodial sentenceshttp://www.chorleyfc.com/index.php/news-menu/club-news/845-guilty Stadium Chorley play at Victory Park. The ground has a capacity of 4,300, of which 2,800 is covered standing and 900 is covered seating. Construction of Victory Park was completed in 1920 at a cost of ¬£1,000. The stadium was named to commemorate the end of the First World War.http://chorley.sponsor- link.tv/content.php?page=3%20ground The ground was very different from the Victory Park of today, as both ends of the ground were exposed to the weather and there was no concrete terracing. The grandstand was a modest wooden structure with accommodation for 600. Chorley, with the aid of ¬£654 raised by a special bazaar, bought Victory Park in 1926 for ¬£868. The Supporters' Club provided ¬£100. In November 1945 a fire broke out and destroyed the main wooden stand shortly after it had been vacated following an FA Cup tie against Accrington Stanley,https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/10/06/nl_ground_chorley_feature.shtml which had been attended by a crowd of 4,019. The stand was practically destroyed and gutted all but the dressing rooms, and the efforts of firemen could not prevent the loss of valuable property, equipment and playing kit. Work on the new grandstand began in 1947, costing ¬£5,500 ‚Äì five and a half times the price of the original one.

They are currently used in RISC OS and the ROX Desktop, and also form the basis of the Zero Install application distribution system. Similar technology includes VMware ThinApp, and the NEXTSTEP/GNUstep/Mac OS X concept of application bundles. Their heritage lies in the system for automatically launching software stored on floppy disk on Acorn's earlier 8-bit micros such as the BBC Micro (the !BOOT file). Bundling various files in this manner allows tools for manipulating applications to be replaced by tools for manipulating the file system. Applications can often be \\"installed\\" simply by dragging them from a distribution medium to a hard disk, and \\"uninstalled\\" by deleting the application directory. Fixed contents RISC OS: Contents of the !Draw application directory RISC OS: Contents of !Draw's !Sprites22 file In order to support user interaction with application directories, several files have special status. =Application binaries= Launching an application directory causes the included file AppRun (ROX Desktop) or !Run (RISC OS) to be launched. On RISC OS this is generally an Obey file (a RISC OS command script) which allocates memory and loads OS extension modules and shared libraries before executing the application binary, usually called !RunImage. Under the ROX Desktop, it is not uncommon for it to be a shell script that will launch the correct system binary if available or compile a suitable binary from source otherwise. =Help files and icons= Both RISC OS and the ROX Desktop allow the user to view help files associated with an application directory without launching the application. RISC OS relies on a file in the directory named !Help which is launched as if the user double-clicked on it when help is requested (and can be any format the system understands, but plain text and !Draw formats are common), while the ROX Desktop opens the application's Help subdirectory. Similarly, custom icons for the Application Directory may be contained within it‚Äîeither .DirIcon (in any supported image format) or AppIcon.xpm under the ROX Desktop, or !Sprites and optionally !Sprites22 under RISC OS. The RISC OS Filer automatically loads these sprite files in the absence of a !Boot file, otherwise it is left to the !Boot file to load the appropriate icons. =!Boot= RISC OS: !Draw's !Boot, !Run and !Help files RISC OS application directories may contain a file named !Boot which is executed by the Filer either explicitly via the FilerBoot command, or when the bundle is first displayed (unless the user held Control when opening that Filer window, which defeats application booting). This allows an application to do tasks such as register supported filetypes (by defining their name, setting command aliases for running or printing them and loading appropriate icons), or choose to load different icons such as ASprites (icons with an alpha channel for RISC OS Select), 5Sprites (icons with a RISC OS 5 appearance) or theme-specific icons. !Boot files are the most popular propagation vector for such RISC OS viruses as exist (such as the well-known Extend virus), though they can be defeated simply by holding Control. The !Boot feature is not duplicated by the ROX Desktop. =The RISC OS !Boot system directory= Acorn's early machines allowed a medium to be \\"booted\\" (automatically run) by executing a file called !BOOT if present (this action, \\"booting a disc\\", was toggled with the Shift, and hence became known as shift- booting). This was exploited in the RISC OS disc structure by having an application directory in the root of the default disc called !Boot. This application directory is executed (run) when the machine boots (if so configured), therefore causing its !Run file to be executed (i.e. $.!Boot.!Run in Acorn pathname syntax). This file then causes various files to be executed, OS modules loaded, standard icons to be loaded and filetypes defined, and defines a number of standard variables through which its various subdirectories are accessed. Thus RISC OS's entire boot sequence can be avoided merely by holding Shift.

Popular in its day, the diet has since been referred to as an \\"outmoded treatment\\"; there is no good evidence that it is effective, and it is difficult for people to follow.  Technique  The diet was originally based on the elimination of salicylate, artificial food coloring, and artificial flavors; later on in the 1970s, the preservatives BHA, BHT, and (somewhat later) TBHQ were eliminated. Besides foods with the eliminated additives, aspirin- or additive-containing drugs and toiletries were to be avoided. Even today, parents are advised to limit their purchases of mouthwash, toothpaste, cough drops, perfume, and various other nonfood products to those published in the Feingold Association's annual Foodlist and Shopping Guide. Some versions of the diet prohibit only artificial food coloring and additives. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists the diet prohibited a number of foods that contain salicylic acid including apples, cucumbers and tomatoes. Feingold stressed that the diet must be followed strictly and for an entire lifetime, and that whole families - not just the subject being \\"treated\\" - must observe the diet's rules.  Effectiveness  Although the diet had a certain popular appeal, a 1983 meta- analysis found research on it to be of poor quality, and that overall there was no good evidence that it was effective in fulfilling its claims. In common with other elimination diets, the Feingold diet can be expensive and boring, and so difficult for people to maintain. In general, there is no evidence to support broad claims that food coloring causes food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children.Tomaska LD and Brooke-Taylor, S. Food Additives ‚Äì General pp. 449‚Äì54 in Encyclopedia of Food Safety, Vol 2: Hazards and Diseases. Eds, Motarjemi Y et al. Academic Press, 2013. p. 452. It is possible that certain food coloring may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence is weak.FDA. Background Document for the Food Advisory Committee: Certified Color Additives in Food and Possible Association with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children: March 30‚Äì31, 2011  Reception  For decades, the Feingold Program required a significant change in family lifestyle because families were limited to a narrow selection of foods. Such foods were sometimes expensive or had to be prepared \\"from scratch,\\" greatly increasing the amount of time and effort a family must put into preparing a meal. As more and more foods without the potentially offending additives are being produced and available in neighborhood supermarkets, this is much less a problem. While some fruits and a few vegetables are eliminated in the first weeks of the Program, they are replaced by others. Often, some or all of these items can be returned to the diet, once the level of tolerance is determined.  History  Feingold was Chief of Pediatrics at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, CA, until 1951, when he became Chief of Allergy at Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. He continued his work with children and adults with hyperactivity and allergy until his death at the age of 82, in 1982. Since the 1940s, researchers worldwide had discussed cross-reactions of aspirin (a common salicylate) and tartrazine (FD&C; Yellow #5). Dr. Stephen Lockey at the Mayo Clinic and later Feingold at Kaiser, hypothesized that eliminating both salicylates and synthetic food additives from patients' diets not only eliminated allergic-type reactions such as asthma, eczema and hives, but also induced behavioral changes in some of their patients. Feingold presented his findings at the annual conference of the American Medical Association in June 1973. This led to a controlled double-blind crossover study published in the August 1976 issue of Pediatrics. A two-week-long conference was arranged in January 1975, in Glen Cove, Long Island. There, the Nutrition Foundation attendees created what they called the National Advisory Committee. The committee widely published its preliminary report concluding that \\"no controlled studies have demonstrated that hyperkinesis is related to the ingestion of food additives.\\"  References   Further reading  * ‚ÄùPsychopharmacological and Other Treatments in Preschool Children with ADHD: Current Evidence and Practice‚Äú J.K.

They were established in 1877 as Clitheroe Central. After joining the Lancashire Combination in 1903, they removed Central from their name. History =Early history= The club was formed as Clitheroe Central in 1877 at the Swan Hotel in Castle Street by local businessmen. After playing in local leagues, and winning their first major trophy (the Lancashire Junior Cup in 1893), the club joined the Lancashire Combination in 1903 and dropped 'Central' from their name. During this period, Clitheroe played their games at the Upbrooks ground, located behind houses on Salthill Road and now partially built over. In 1925 the club moved a few hundred yards to its present home of Shawbridge. =20th century= Except for breaks during the First and Second World Wars (1914‚Äì18 and 1939‚Äì45) Clitheroe played in the Lancashire Combination until the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season. They won the Lancashire Combination Cup in the 1934‚Äì35 season and the League Championship in the 1979‚Äì80 season. For the 1982‚Äì83 season the Lancashire Combination amalgamated with the Cheshire County League to become the North West Counties League. Clitheroe became one of the founder members, however the state of the ground meant they started in the third division. There then followed one of the most successful periods in the club's long history when under the guidance of manager Eric Whalley they won the Third, Second and First Divisions in consecutive seasons, as well as securing the Lancashire Cup in 1985. In the 1995‚Äì96 season when under the joint managership of Dennis Underwood and Gary Butcher they played at Wembley Stadium in the final of the FA Vase. Some 7,500 people watched the game against Brigg Town and although Clitheroe won against them earlier in the season in the FA Cup the club was beaten 3‚Äì0 in the Vase Final. A public appeal to help with the visit to Wembley saw ¬£7,400 donated by townspeople and businesses. The last decade of the 20th century saw most of the ten years spent getting the ground up to scratch with ¬£130,000 being spent in the process. The sale of two players, Jon Penman and Carlo Nash, helped considerably with the expenditure on the ground. The club saw little success on the pitch after the Wembley visit until manager Steve Parry led them to the Floodlight Trophy by beating Kidsgrove Athletic 2‚Äì1 in the 1998‚Äì99 final. =21st century= Dave Burgess took over the management of the first team in 2000‚Äì01 after several successful years running the second string, with player Lee Sculpher as his assistant. In their first season they finished as league runners-up and FA Vase semi-finalists. Work commitments led to Burgess standing down in 2001‚Äì02. Sculpher took over and again finished as league runners-up before losing 2‚Äì1 to Mossley in the League Cup final at Bury's Gigg Lane ground. Early cup exits the following season enabled the Blues to concentrate on the league and their away form saw the 2003‚Äì04 NWCFL championship won on the final day of the season with a 3‚Äì2 victory at Nantwich Town ‚Äì a late goal from Neil Reynolds sealing the title, the trophy lifted by captain Adam Gardner and club stalwart Keith Lord. With the title came the reward of promotion to the Northern Premier League for the 2004-05 season. =Northern Premier League= In November 2004 Lee Sculpher resigned as manager and short spells in charge by Paul Byron, Tommy Lawson and Mark Smitheringale followed before Chris Stammers was appointed manager in September 2006. After the 10‚Äì1 loss to Kettering Town in the FA Trophy, Stammers tendered his resignation stating that he had taken the club as far as he could. His assistant Ash Berry took temporary charge of team affairs before the club appointed Neil Reynolds and Kendal's veteran player Peter Smith as the new management team in December. Smith took over sole managerial duties at the end of the 2008-09 season, going on to lead the club to 8th (2009‚Äì10) and 6th (2010‚Äì11) place finishes, the highest league placings in the club's history to date. The end of the 2010-11 season saw Pete Smith replaced as manager by Carl Garner, club chairman of four years' standing. The vacant position of Chair was taken over by Garner's long-standing deputy Anne Barker, who remains in the role. Early success for Garner in 2011-12 (including the Manager of the Month award) was followed by a tailing off in form. He resigned with ten games to go, Dave Burgess and Lee Sculpher returning on a temporary basis to see the season out. Paul Moore took over the reins in 2012-13, leading Clitheroe to their record points haul and an 8th-place finish. In contrast, a poor start to the 2013-14 season, with early exits from the FA Cup and Trophy, saw Moore replaced by ex-Blue Simon Garner, son of former chairman/manager Carl. With his assistant (and another ex-Blue) Ryan Parr, Garner secured safety with a 17th-place finish, improving on this for 2014-15 with 13th place and an appearance in the Lancashire Challenge Trophy final (a 3-0 defeat to Chorley). The good work continued into 2015-16 when a strong playoff push only faltered in the closing weeks of the season, resulting in a creditable 7th-place finish. Garner and Parr stood down at the season's end, citing family reasons. In April 2016, Simon Haworth was appointed manager, assisted by Gareth Roberts, with coaches Ian Johnson and Irfan Kawri. In May 2017 the management team were joined by Ben Kay, former joint manager at Ashton Athletic. In June 2017, Gareth Roberts left the role of Assistant Manager to join Skelmersdale United.

It is usually eaten for breakfast, especially during the Christmas season. It is traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with leaves. It is a subtype of kakanin (rice cakes) in Philippine cuisine. Bibingka is also found in East Timor and Christian communities in eastern Indonesia. Preparation Bibingka Galapong cooked with slices of salted egg with toppings of grated coconut and kesong puti (carabao cheese) The original method of preparing the glutinous rice used in bibingka is known as galapong (commonly incorrectly translated as \\"rice flour\\"). It is an ancient tradition unique to the Philippines and related Austronesian regions. It is essential for most Philippine rice desserts. Unlike in other Asian cuisines, the rice is not prepared dry. Rather it is soaked overnight in tapayan jars and are usually allowed to ferment by the addition of wild yeast called bubod or with tuba palm wine. The rice is then ground into a thick paste using stone mills before being cooked. This gives a characteristically slightly sour aftertaste in Filipino traditional rice cakes. The same process (tapay) when extended for longer periods result in traditional rice vinegars and rice wines. Bibingka is a general term for baked galapong-based cakes, similar to how puto is the general term for steamed galapong-based. In recent times, it has extended its meaning to other native cakes made with other types of flour like corn flour, cassava flour, or plain flour, though these are usually considered separate dishes altogether. Origins The shared origins of bibingka from the Philippines and Indonesia is widely acknowledged. Especially given that the Indonesian bibingka is from Eastern Indonesia, the regions closest to the Philippines with the most closely related cultures. Some authors have also proposed a connection between the Goan dessert bebinca (or bibik) and the Southeast Asian bibingka due to the similarity in names. They believe that the Portuguese may have introduced it to Southeast Asia from Goa. But this is unlikely, given that the Philippines, where bibingka is most widely known, was never a colony of Portugal. They are also very different; the Goan dessert is a type of layered coconut pudding (similar to Filipino sapin-sapin and Indonesian kue lapis), while bibingka is a simple baked glutinous rice cake. The only similarity is that bebinca and bibingka both use coconut milk. Rice-based dishes are also far more diverse in Southeast Asia, where rice is an ancient Austronesian staple crop. Thus it is more likely that the Portuguese introduced the term to Goa from the Philippines, rather than the other way around. Similar to how the art of windowpane oyster shell windows were also introduced from the Philippines to Goa (they are still called capiz in Goa after the Philippine province of Capiz). In the Philippines Bibingka is a traditional Philippine Christmas food. It is usually eaten along with puto bumb√≥ng right after the Simbang Gabi ('Night mass', the Filipino version of Misa de Gallo). They are sold outside of churches during the nine-day novena for worshippers to eat for breakfast. As of October 9, 2007, the town of Dingras, Ilocos Norte in the Philippines is expecting a Guinness World Records certification after baking a kilometer-long cassava bibingka made from 1,000 kilos of cassava and eaten by 1,000 residents. Abs-Cbn Interactive, Ilocos Norte town makes 'longest bibingka' Also, in the municipality of Baliuag, Bulacan, bibingka is served along with salabat (ginger tisane) and the stores selling them serve them for free. =Preparation= Traditionally prepared bibingka in Baliuag, Bulacan Bibingka is traditionally made with galap√≥ng (slightly fermented soaked glutinous rice ground into a paste) and coconut milk or water. Modern versions sometimes use regular rice flour or Japanese mochiko flour. Other ingredients can vary greatly, but the most common secondary ingredients are eggs and milk. The traditional preparation is very time-consuming. A specially made terra cotta container is lined with a single large section of a banana leaf. It is placed over preheated coals and the rice flour and water mixture is poured into it, taking care not to spill it into the container itself. Another piece of banana leaf is added to the top and covered with more preheated coals. Bakery-made bibingka in banana leaf liner showing the distinctive notched edges from cupcake tin molds The end result is a soft and spongy large flat cake that is slightly charred on both surfaces and infused with the unique aroma of toasted banana leaves. Toppings are then added, usually consisting of butter/margarine, sugar, cheese, or grated coconut. Other more uncommon toppings include pinipig (pounded immature rice grains), pineapple, and salted duck eggs. A mixture of two or more of these toppings on a single bibingka are also common. Bibingka with sumptuous amounts of toppings (and ingredients) are sometimes called bibingka especial. More modern methods involve bibingka being baked in an actual oven inside a caldero or ordinary cake pans. The result lacks the distinctive smoky smell of charcoal but is otherwise the same, especially if banana leaves are also used to line it. Mass-produced bibingka in Philippine bakeries are also made using characteristic tin molds that give them a crenelated shape similar to large puto or puto mamon (cupcakes). Bibingka is best served hot. Large bibingka can be sliced (or torn) into several wedges and can serve 4 to 6 people. =Taste and texture= Bibingka has a soft spongy texture similar to puto, another Philippine rice cake. It is eaten hot or warm and is slightly sweet with a taste very similar to rice pudding. The top and bottom surfaces (including the traditional banana leaf lining) are also usually charred, adding to the flavor. =Variants= Bibingka is also used as a general term for desserts made with flour and baked in the same manner. The term can be loosely translated to \\"[rice] cake\\". It originally referred primarily to bibingka galapong, the most common type of bibingka made with rice flour. Other native Philippine cakes have also sometimes been called bibingka. These may use other kinds of flour, such as corn flour, cassava flour, or plain flour, and are usually considered separate dishes altogether. Bibingka can also be made with uncommon ingredients, including chocolate. Most varieties of bibingka differ only from the type of toppings they use. The common types of bibingka are listed below: * Bibingka galap√≥ng is the traditional form of bibingka made from ground soaked glutinous rice (galap√≥ng), water, and coconut milk. It was originally only made with water and galap√≥ng. * Bibingkang malagk√≠t is a moist version of bibingka, typically served sliced into square blocks. It commonly also includes slices of ripe jackfruit (langka) and topped with latik (coconut caramel) and grated coconut. It is very similar to biko, except that it is baked and uses galapong instead of whole grain. * Bibingkang Mandaue (Mandaue- style Bibingka) are bibingka from Mandaue, Cebu. It is traditionally made with tub√¢ (palm wine) which gives it a slightly tart aftertaste. Nowadays, tub√¢ is often substituted with yeast. *Bibingkoy - a unique variant from Cavite which has a filling of sweetened mung beans and served with a sauce of coconut cream, jackfruit, and sago. It is very similar to mache, but is baked instead of steamed. *Buko bibingka - Bibingka baked with slivers of young coconut flesh (buko). * Cassava cake is made from grated cassava (instead of rice), coconut milk, and condensed milk. It is the most similar to pudding in appearance. Also known as cassava bibingka or bibingkang kamoteng kahoy. :*Cassava buko bibingka - a variant of cassava cake that adds young coconut (buko) to the recipe. :*Pineapple cassava bibingka - a variant of cassava cake that adds crushed pineapple chunks. :*Royal bibingka - a variant of cassava cake from Vigan, Ilocos Sur shaped like cupcakes with a cheese and margarine topping. *Durian bibibngka - Bibingka baked with durian flesh. A specialty of the Davao Region in Mindanao. *Salukara, a pancake-like variant of bibingka from Eastern Samar. It also uses tub√¢ and is traditionally cooked in pans greased with pork lard. *Sinukat a type of bibingka baked in half of a coconut shell.

It is prepared almost identically to Philippine bibingka. In the provinces of North Sulawesi and Gorontalo, bibingka is usually made with rice or cassava flour and coconut milk with shredded coconut baked inside. In the Maluku Islands, bibingka is spiced and sweetened with brown sugar or sweet meat floss. It is also traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with banana, pandan, or nipa leaves. As in the Philippines, it is also usually eaten during the Christmas season. A pancake-like variant of bibingka was introduced to the Chinese Indonesian communities of East Java during the Dutch colonial period. Known as wingko, wiwingka, or bibika, it became popular throughout the island of Java. =Variants= * Bibingka kelapa or bibingka santan, Indonesian bibingka made from rice flour and coconut milk, topped with jackfruit or coconut * Bibingka kelapa, Indonesian bibingka made from rice flour and coconut milk, topped with jackfruit or coconut * Bibingka abon, made from rice flour and coconut milk, topped with meat floss * Bibingka ubi telo, made from ube or cassava flour and coconut milk * Bibingka nanas or wingko nanas, made from ube or cassava flour and coconut milk with pineapple See also * Tupig * Espasol * Kakanin * Kalamay * Kue * Panyalam * Puto * Puto bumbong * Sapin-sapin References External links Category:Christmas food Category:Kue Category:Indonesian cuisine Category:Indonesian rice dishes Category:Indonesian desserts Category:Javanese cuisine Category:Philippine cuisine Category:Philippine rice dishes Category:Philippine desserts ","title":"Bibingka"},{"id":"3668102","text":"Fitzgerald Henry (13 January 1921 ‚Äì 14 March 2007), better known as the Mighty Terror, was a Trinidadian calypsonian. Early career in Trinidad He was born Fitzgerald Cornelius Henry in Anguilla Village, Arouca, Trinidad.Paul Wadey, \\"The Mighty Terror - Calypso king\\", The Independent, 19 March 2007.Peter Mason, \\"Obituary: Mighty Terror\\", The Guardian, 4 April 2007. he studied trumpet as a child and also sang in church and school choirs.\\"The Mighty Terror - About the artist\\", Google play - Music. His career started in 1947, and following the success of his \\"Negroes Know Thyself\\" he debuted at the Calypso Palace Tent in 1948. He joined the Young Brigade Tent in 1949, where he continued playing until leaving Trinidad in 1953. In 1950 he his first 78 release was \\"Changing of the Indian Song\\". During his time in Trinidad he recorded first for Sa Gomes (1951), for Christopher (1952) and took part in the Dial sessions in 1953. He was one of the first major calypsonians to have records released on Emil Shallit's UK-based Melodisc Records, in 1950.Thompson, Dave (2002), Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, p. 5. . Move to England In 1953, he took a job as a fireman on a ship and arrived in England later that year, going first to London. In his own words: :\\"I jump in a taxi and I say, Do you know of a gentleman called Lord Kitchener? I figure he popular and a taxi driver should know. He tell me he dead long time ago. Not that one (I said). This one is a calypsonian from the West Indies, Trinidad.\\" Popular or not, the taxi driver had not heard of Lord Kitchener so took him to a West Indian club where he was given the phone number of guitarist Fitzroy Coleman. Terror moved in with the Colemans and within a month he was regularly singing in the clubs and had won a contract to sing a jingle for the BBC. He continued recording for Melodisc in 1954 (scoring a hit with \\"Chinese Children\\", and following it up with other releases for the label, including \\"The Emperor of Africa,\\" \\"Chopping Wood\\" and \\"Chinee Children Call Me Daddy\\") and took part in the Nixa sessions in 1958 (these tracks being released by Pye Records). With the significant commercial success of 1957's \\"Life in London\\" and \\"I'll Walk a Million Miles\\", he was named \\"Calypso King of Great Britain\\" at a charity concert organised by Claudia Jones after attacks on the West London black community, which was a prelude to the now famous Notting Hill Carnival.Image of \\"Caribbean Carnival\\" 1959 brochure. The time between 1958 and 1964 was spent touring, first with Lord Kitchener and later with the Bert McLean Trio. Return to Trinidad Terror returned to Trinidad in 1965 and won the Calypso King crown in 1966. In April 1966, he represented Trinidad at the Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal. In 1985 his home country awarded him the Silver Hummingbird Medal for services to Calypso music.National Awards Database, The Office of the President, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The Mighty Terror performed in Trinidad into his old age. In later life he became ill with cancer of the throat, and after an appeal by his wife Gloria, Pan Trinbago and the National Carnival Commission (NCC) agreed to foot the bill for Nursing Home care once he left hospital. Patrick Arnold of Pan Trinbago said, \\"We felt a responsibility to spare him the ignominy of an existence that would rob him of his dignity and decided to do something about it,\\" while Kenny Da Silva of the NCC added, \\"You can‚Äôt leave somebody like Terror to chance and to the vagaries of a life in an infirm condition in the winter of his years.\\"\\"Pan Trinbago, NCC come to Terror‚Äôs aid\\", Newsday, 21 September 2006. The Mighty Terror died aged 86 on 14 March 2007 as a result of throat cancer. Music and lyrics Like most Calypso, the Mighty Terror's songs tell a story. Many of them contain a lot of innuendo and some surprisingly explicit themes for the time they were released. Examples of a number of his themes follow: =Personal life= \\"TV Calypso\\" - about buying his very first TV after being continually nagged by his wife and daughter. \\"Patricia Gone With Millicent\\" - about his wife leaving him for a violent lesbian relationship. =Other calypsonians= \\"Kitch Cavalcade\\" - a tribute to Lord Kitchener. \\"Calypso War\\" A tirade against \\"fake\\" calypsonians from Jamaica. =Social commentary= \\"Heading North\\" - about the racial discrimination in the Southern States of the U.S. at the time. \\"Brownskin Gal\\" and \\"Jamaica Girl\\" - about the behaviour of American soldiers towards local girls in the Caribbean. =Pure humour= \\"Women Police in England\\"\\"The Mighty Terror - Women police in England (audio)\\" \\\\- about his efforts to get arrested by the \\"lovely blondy\\" policewoman he saw (inspired by Spoiler's \\"Women Police in Trinidad\\").

Warehouse is administrated by Musictoday, a Charlottesville, Virginia-based company run by DMB manager Coran Capshaw. The success of the Warehouse led to Musictoday running similar online fan clubs for other major artists. Musictoday was acquired by major concert promoter Live Nation. Distribution of Tickets The primary benefit of Warehouse membership is the opportunity for fans to purchase tickets before they go on sale to the general public. Fans submit ticket requests during the \\"request period,\\" which typically lasts two weeks. These submissions are put into a random lottery and confirmations are often posted within a month, but always before the public on-sale date through Ticketmaster, or other outlets. Finally, seat locations are withheld until after the public on-sale and may not be posted until the tickets ship, a month prior to the concert, in an effort to deter scalping by members. *For the Dave Matthews Band tours from 1999‚Äì2001, the allotment of tickets was provided to fans via a lottery, weighted toward seniority. Members who joined in the Warehouse's earlier years got better seat locations than newer members. *In 2002, with the band playing smaller venues, and in an attempt to attract new members, Warehouse adopted a new \\"random seniority\\" method. Seniority now only applies to the ticket allotment of some concerts, and not others. Fans are not told in advance which shows will utilize the seniority method, until the pre-sale has been completed and the non-refundable tickets have been paid for. *In 2003, Seniority was not in effect for the Warehouse distribution of tickets for the Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds acoustic tour. *Later that year, when Dave Matthews Band played a free concert at Central Park in New York, New York, tickets were given to all Warehouse members that requested them, only charging them for postage via FedEx or UPS. Outside of the Warehouse allotment, few tickets were available to the general public. Warehouse membership packages Starting in 1999, Warehouse club members received an annual gift package. Membership packages are mailed to members that joined or renewed in that year. After the original package in 1999, all membership packages included an exclusive Warehouse CD. All of these CDs, except for one (see 2001), are Warehouse 5 volumes and contain five live tracks from various tours. In 2003, the first Warehouse 8 volume was released and distributed to those who had been members for three years or more. The Warehouse 8 releases have three additional tracks. =2000= This package featured the original \\"Warehouse 5\\" CD, black-and- white photo postcards of each band member, and a small poster.

It is the closest commune to Paris, located from the city center. Name The name Gentilly was recorded for the first time in the 6th century as Gentilly, a royal estate of some importance where coinage was minted. The etymology of the name seems to be \\"estate of Gentilius\\", a Gallo-Roman landowner. However, some other researchers think that the name is connected with Latin gentilis (meaning \\"gentile\\", \\"pagan\\", \\"foreigner\\") in reference to foreign goldsmiths who may have settled in Gentilly in the Early Middle Ages. History On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, about half of the commune of Gentilly was annexed to Paris, and forms now the neighborhoods of Maison-Blanche and Glaci√®re, in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. On 13 December 1896, about half of the remaining territory of Gentilly was detached and became the commune of Le Kremlin- Bic√™tre, leaving Gentilly with about a quarter of its pre-1860 area. Culture The famous photographer Robert Doisneau was born in Gentilly (April 14, 1912). There is a Maison de la photographie Robert Doisneau an international cultural center for humanist photography.

The Wymondham-Dereham branch line was built by the Norfolk Railway and the line and stations were opened on 15 February 1847. . The station was rebuilt by the Great Eastern Railway and provided with a second platform when the line was doubled in the early 1880s. A new up platform was constructed, and the existing buildings were given new glass-fronted passenger accommodation and platform canopies. In 1882 the station was considered a request stop. Until 1923 the station was known as 'Kimberley', but this was changed to 'Kimberley Park' during the Grouping to avoid confusion with Kimberley station in Nottinghamshire. The main buildings were on the down platform, with a smaller waiting room being provided on the up. The goods yard was situated on the down side of the line, comprising a single siding linked by trailing connections to the up and down main lines.

It was one of the most important religious centres in the region. The site is located south of the village Kumluova in the Fethiye district of Muƒüla Province, Turkey. It lies approximately four kilometres south of Xanthos along the Xanthos River.Noted by Strabo, xiv.2.2 and 3.6. History Archaeological finds at the site, which was never a fully-occupied settlement, but remained essentially a religious centre, date back to the late sixth century BCE. This was before the Greek cultural hegemony in Lycia, which began in the early fourth century. In earlier times, the site was probably already sacred to the cult of an earlier mother goddess ‚Äî she is Eni Mahanahi in Lycia ‚Äî which was superseded by the worship of Leto, joined by her twin offspring.Lycian Turkey. In Greek mythology, a claim for an early cult of Apollo in the valley of the Xanthus, unsupported by history or archaeology, was provided by two myths, each connected to an eponymous \\"Lycus\\". One sprang from the autochthonous Telchines of Rhodes and would have colonized the region at the time of Deucalion's flood; the other Lycus was an Athenian brother of Aegeus driven from Athens, a seer who introduced the cult of Lycaean Apollo, which a folk etymology connected with Lycia and therefore made him its Athenian colonizer:Pierre Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology: \\"Lycus\\". see Lycus (mythology). The foundations of the Hellenistic temple dedicated to Leto, and her children, Artemis and Apollo, have been excavated under the direction of H. Metzger from 1962.H. Metzger, \\"Fouilles du L√©t√¥on de Xanthe (1962-65)\\" Revue arch√©ologique (1966). Arch√¶ologists have excavated much of the ruins; discoveries include the Letoon trilingual, bearing inscriptions in Greek, Lycian and Aramaic, which has provided crucial keys in the deciphering of the Lycian language; it is conserved in the Fethiye Museum. The sacrosanctity of the site is the purport of an anecdote related by Appian concerning Mithridates, who was planning to cut down the trees in the sacred grove for his own purposes in his siege of the Lycian coastal city of Patara, but was warned against the sacrilegious action in a nightmare.Appian, Mithridates, 27, noted by T. R. Bryce, \\"The Arrival of the Goddess Leto in Lycia\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 321 (1983:1-13). p. 3 and note 9. The site remained active through the Roman period.

At the 2006 census, its population was 13,778, in 3,638 families. It is named for bosh, a native herb common to this region. Boshruyeh is located between the cities of Ferdows and Tabas at the border of the Dasht-e Kavir. Near this city, there are old villages namad Aresk, Raqqeh, Korond, Neigenan and Ghaniabad. The geographic coordinates of Boshruyeh are 33¬∞52' N and 57¬∞25' E. The weather usually is warm and in summer it is very hot. The average rain in a year is less than 150 mm. Agriculture Boshruyeh is an important agricultural region in the South Khorasan Province and agriculture employs many residents. The main products are cotton, wheat, saffron, barley, caraway, pistachio, melon and watermelon. In this city, agriculture is based on underground water. This implies that farmers are using powerful engines to bring water out. Because of low annual precipitation, it is believed that local aquifers are being gradually depleted of their ground water resources, by extensive pumping. The sound of diesel engines fills the atmosphere of this small town on a 24-hr a day basis. If so, the ground water level will continue to go down requiring deeper and deeper wells and more powerful diesel engines. The water is typically saline (high salt content) which promotes salinization of the land under the arid climatic condition of high evaporation and low precipitation. In short, if no attention is paid to this problem, farming will likely result in unproductive barren land in the not so distant future. History There are several historic buildings in Boshruyeh and its surroundings. Based on historical books, it seems that this city has been existed at least for 700 years. Some of the most famous buildings are: 1\\\\. Qal'eye Dokhtar \\"Young Woman's Castle\\": This citadel is located on the top of a mountain in the west of the city.

The remains of several ancient temples can be seen in Pinara, as well as rock tombs including one \\"royal tomb\\", an upper and a lower acropolis, a theatre, an odeon, an agora and a church. The name Pinara has somewhat been assimilated to the name of the present-day village of Minare, half an hour below the ruins and depending Fethiye district of Muƒüla Province, Turkey. Name Crag with rock-cut tombs towering over Pinara situated on a \\"round\\" mass of rock, believed to have given the ancient city its name. There was a cult of Pandarus, the Lycian hero of the Trojan War, in Pinara, which led some sources to conclude that he was a native of the city.Strabo xiv. 665; Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. Artymnesos; Arrian, Anab. i. 24; Pliny the Elder, v. 28; Ptolemy v. 3. ¬ß 5; Hierocles p. 684. According to the Lycian history of Menecrates, quoted by Stephanus of ByzantiumStyephanus, s.v. Artymnesos . the city was a colony of Xanthos, its original name would be Artymnesos (). This name would have preceded the Lycian language name Pinara, derived from the form \\"Pille√±ni\\" or \\"Pinale\\" meaning a \\"round hill\\" or simply \\"round\\", based on a hypothesis of interchange of liquid consonants. The town is indeed situated on such a great round mass of rock and a more or less circular crag towers over the ruins. Another source, Panyassis, also mentions an eponymous founder by name Pinarus, son of Tremiles or Termilus, and this account is viewed by some sources as unsubstantial as the rest relating to the precedence of names. History The city, though not often mentioned by ancient writers, appears from its vast and beautiful ruins to have been, as Strabo asserts, one of Lycia's largest, its chief port city until the harbor silted up to form the reed-filled wetlands of today. Yet another rare mention of the city in ancient sources is in connection with the help it provided, along with several other Lycian cities, to Pixodarus of Caria. Ogival rock-cut tomb at Pinara, 4th century BC. Pinara was a member of the Lycian League, in which it held three votes. The city surrendered to Alexander the Great in 334 BCE. After Alexander's death, the city fell to the kingdom of Pergamum. Pinara became a Roman city when Pergamum was willed by its last king Attalus III to the Roman Republic in 133 BCE. The city enjoyed prosperity during Roman rule, but was badly damaged by earthquakes in 141 and 240 CE. In the first occurrence, the city is recorded to have received a contribution from Opramoas for the repair of public buildings. Rock-cut tombs in Pinara. Pinara was Christianized early. Five bishops are known: Eustathius, who signed the formula of Acacius of C√¶sarea at the Council of Seleucia in 359; Heliodorus, who signed the letter from the bishops of Lycia to the emperor Leo I the Thracian (458); Zenas, present at the Trullan Council (692); Theodore, at the Second Council of Nicaea (787); Athanasius, at the synod that reinstated Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople (the Photian Council) in 879. Pinara was the birthplace of Nicolas of Myra. Under repeated pressure from invading forces, the city lost its inhabitants in the ninth century. Scientific discovery Pinara's ruins were identified by Sir Charles Fellows. From amidst the ancient city, he says, rises a singular round rocky cliff (the pinara of the Lycians), literally speckled all over with tombs. Beneath this cliff lie the ruins of the extensive and splendid city. The theater is in a very perfect state; all the seats are remaining, with the slanting sides towards the proscenium, as well as several of its doorways. The walls and several of the buildings are of the Cyclopean masonry, with massive gateways formed of three immense stones. The tombs are innumerable, and the inscriptions are in the Lycian characters, but Greek also occurs often on the same tombs. Some of these rock-tombs are adorned with fine and rich sculptures. The Christian bishopric of Pinara, no longer a residential see, is included in the Catholic Church' list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 953 See also *List of ancient Greek cities Footnotes References * ;Attribution * * Further reading * * External links * 110 pictures of Pinara Category:Populated places in ancient Lycia Category:Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey Category:Roman sites in Turkey Category:Catholic titular sees in Asia Category:Fethiye Category:History of Muƒüla Province ","title":"Pinara"},{"id":"3668171","text":"Eastwood Town Football Club was an English football club based in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. The club last participated in the Northern Premier League Division One South, the eighth tier of English football. A new club, Eastwood Community F.C., was formed in 2014 following the demise of Eastwood Town. History Eastwood were established in 1955. During the 1970s, the club competed in the Midland League. In 1983, Eastwood were founder members of the Northern Counties East Football League. In 1987, they joined the Northern Premier League but returned to the NCEL for the 2003‚Äì04 season.http://www.fchd.info/EASTWOOT.HTM In the 2008/09 season, Eastwood had a successful run in the FA Cup, defeating Wrexham and Wycombe Wanderers on their way to the third round of the competition. Eastwood finished as league champions and were promoted to the Conference North for the first time in their history. Eastwood finished in 4th place for their first season in the Conference North, but were denied permission to take part in the play offs due to insufficient ground grading. As a result, the club was put up for sale by its owners. In November 2013, the club was issued with a winding up petition over an unpaid tax bill of ¬£168,000 and council officials barred the club from using the Coronation Park ground.http://twohundredpercent.net/the-death-and- possible-rebirth-of-eastwood-town-fc/ After postponing five consecutive home games, the club resigned from the Northern Premier League in February 2014.https://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/latest-news/northern-league- step-three/9862/eastwood-town-resign-from-evo-stik-npl/ Stadium There had been a lot of work done in the background and plans had been drawn up to bring the ground up to the 'A' grade required to enter the Conference National. The plans showed new terracing holding 1900 fans behind both goals and a new seated stand replacing the Mabe Allan Stand almost down the entire length of the pitch. This would have given the club three fully enclosed stands and a capacity of over 5,000. With the plans for the academy and the other projects, the club was in negotiations with the local authorities to take over the existing all-weather pitch situated within Coronation Park along with the changing rooms. The plan was to redevelop the pitch into a full sized 3G pitch, with the adjoining area being developed into an outdoor juniors pitch for use of the community and Eastwood Town Juniors. This would have given the club the infrastructure to attract the best local youngsters as well as players released from professional clubs academies. The club had received a few complaints from residents on Chewton Street about the increased problems associated with matchday parking and this was another issue that had been raised and negotiations were in progress with the council to address the situation, with the objective of providing more car parking facilities at the club. The club were also in discussions with the council about additional signage off the A610, and the end of Chewton Street.

Tlos is believed to be one of the most important religious Lycian sites and settlement on the site is said to have begun more than 4,000 years ago. Roman theatre of Tlos Remains of the Ottoman castle thumb250pxLycian rock tombs Lycian rock tombs History It is one of the oldest and largest settlements of Lycia (known as 'Tlawa' in Lycian inscriptions) and was subsequently inhabited by Romans, Byzantines and eventually Ottoman Turks, making it one of few Lycian cities to be continually inhabited up until the 19th century. Name According to Stephanus of Byzantium, the city was named after Tlos, one of the four sons of the nymph Praxidike () and Tremilus ().Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, T627.1 Praxidike was a daughter of Ogyges ().Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, T633.8 Location Tlos lies on the east side of the Xanthos valley atop a rocky outcrop that slopes up from a plateau from a modern village, but ends on the west, north and northeast in almost perpendicular cliffs. Structures The influence of many cultures upon Tlos has resulted in a patchwork of structures dominated by an acropolis and fortress. On the slopes leading up to the acropolis are numerous Lycian sarcophagi and many house-type of rock tombs and temple-type rock tombs cut into the rock face of the hill. One such is the Tomb of Bellerophon, a large temple-type tomb with an unfinished facade of four columns featuring a relief in its porch of the legendary hero Bellerophon riding on his winged horse so called as Pegasus. A carving of a lion or leopard is inside the tomb.

The Ottomans constructed a fort for the local feudal governor Kanlƒ± Ali Aƒüa (Bloody Chief Ali) upon the foundations of the fortress. Since early Lycian times, the city's settlement was likely concentrated on the southern slope and western slopes. Wide terraces with cisterns and the back walls of buildings carved from the rock are found there, as well as an agora, a Roman-era theatre, for plays and concerts, public Roman baths and the remains of an early Byzantine church.

Only the seats remain and the arena is now a local farmer's field. Granite columns were strewn about the area, which could indicate a columned portico on the north side of the arena. Parallel with the stadium is what researchers presume is two-storey, 150-metre long market more than 30 feet wide with small rectangular doors and large arched doors in its west wall. The building is constructed of carefully jointed ashlar masonry. At the south end is a wider building with several chambers and four large arched doors. There is also a palaestra to the right of the market hall complex with public baths on its other side.

File:Tlos Big Roman Bath 5492.jpgTlos Big Roman Bath File:Tlos Big Roman Bath 5494.jpgTlos Big Roman Bath File:Tlos Small Roman bath 5508.jpg There is also a Roman theatre with 34 rows of seats. A portion of the stage building still stands and there are many highly decorated carvings scattered all around. An inscription records that donations have been made for the theatre from private citizens and religious dignitaries, ranging from 3,000 denarii by the priest of Dionysus and high priest of the Cabiria to lesser donations of 100 denarii. The philanthropist Opramoas also made a very large donation for the theatre. It is also known from inscriptions that the theatre was under construction for at least 150 years. The smaller public bath comprises three rooms: two are in the western part of the building and the third is a large rectangular room to the east. Another room to the west may have been part of the complex. All the rooms had barrel-vaulted ceilings. To the north of the smaller bath stood a palaestra. Also near the baths are the remains of a Byzantine church, temple and what is believed to have been the agora (The market place). The latter is located across the road from the theatre. Importance in the region Tlos was one of the six principal cities of Lycia (and purportedly one of the most powerful). The city was dubbed \\"the very brilliant metropolis of the Lycian nation\\" during the Roman period. There is evidence that Tlos was a member of the Lycian League, to which in 168 BC Rome granted autonomy instead of dependence on Rhodes. Opramoas of Rhodiapolis and another wealthy philanthropist financed much 2nd-century AD for the civic building works in the city. Inscriptions reveal that citizens of Tlos were divided into demes (social subdivisions), and the names of three of them are known: Bellerophon, Iobates and Sarpedon, famous Lycian heroes of legend. A Jewish community is also known to have existed with its own magistrates.  Bishopric  Tlos became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Mira, capital of the Roman province of Lycia. It was represented at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 by its bishop Andreas, who also was a signatory of the letter that in 458 the bishops of the province sent to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Eustathius was at the synod convoked by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536. Ioannes was at the Trullan Council of 692. Constantinus took part in the Second Council of Nicaea (787). Another Andreas was at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879).Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 979-980Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 449 No longer a residential bishopric, Tlos is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 993 Among the titular bishops of Tlos were: George Hilary Brown (titular bishop 22 April 1842 - 29 September 1850, when he was created bishop of Liverpool), Charles-Fran√ßois Baillargeon (titular bishop 14 January 1851 - 25 August 1867, when he was created Archbishop of Quebec), Martin Griver (titular bishop 1 October 1869 - 22 July 1873, when he was created bishop of Perth, Australia); Eug√®ne-Louis Kleiner (titular bishop from 17 June 1910 until his death on 19 August 1915); Paciano Aniceto (titular bishop from 7 April 1979 until 20 October 1983, when he was created Bishop of Iba); Carl Anthony Fisher (titular bishop from 23 December 1986 until his death on 2 September 1993).Catholic Hierarchy Rediscovery Tlos was rediscovered by Charles Fellows in 1838 and he was followed by the explorer Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, who thought that \\"a grander site for a great city could scarcely have been selected in all Lycia.\\"  Mythology  In mythology, it was the city inhabited by hero Bellerophon and his winged horse Pegasus. It is known that the king-type tomb in the necropolis is dedicated to Bellerophon.  Modern times  On the opposite hill top, the village of Yaka now co-exists with Tlos. Fields and pomegranate trees make for picturesque scenery. Tlos is a popular destination for tourist from the coastal town such as Fethiye, Kas and Kalkan. At the entrance of the site stands a small white prefabricated ticket hut. Opposite the acropolis are some small caf√©s with toilet facilities and parking. There is also a natural spring.Tlos  Turkey Travel Information As of 2017, Akdeniz University Archaeology Professor Taner Korkut is head of the excavation efforts at the site. Korkut specialises in ancient cuisine and eating habits, and has excavated basket and steam cooking pottery at the site.

Like uranium dioxide and some other uranium compounds, uranium carbide can be used as a nuclear fuel for nuclear reactors, usually in the form of pellets or tablets. Uranium carbide fuel was used in late designs of nuclear thermal rockets. Uranium carbide pellets are used as fuel kernels for the US version of pebble bed reactors; the German version uses uranium dioxide instead. As nuclear fuel, uranium carbide can be used either on its own, or mixed with plutonium carbide (PuC and Pu2C3). The mixture is also labeled as uranium-plutonium carbide ( (U,Pu)C ). Uranium carbide is also a popular target material for particle accelerators.

The late Brian Lambie began a remarkable collection of artefacts from the area over some 40 years, and with a number of others created BMT which became responsible for a number of museums. It became apparent to the Trustees that the buildings were not able to meet modern requirements, were difficult to access and expensive to maintain and develop. In 2010 an opportunity arose to acquire a large site in the centre of the town, and a project to create a new museum to bring the collections together and meet current requirements and visitor aspirations. The cost of the project was ¬£2.2 million, of which more than half was raised from within the town and scattered rural community of the area, together with Funding from the Clyde Wind Farm Community Fund, South Lanarkshire LEADER, Museums Galleries Scotland and a number of private trusts.

Set in New Orleans in 1780, it tells how Captain Richard Warrington is commissioned to unmask and capture a notorious French pirate calling himself \\"Bras Pique\\" ‚Äì and how he is helped and hindered by a high-spirited runaway, Contessa Marietta. The score includes many well- known songs, including \\"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\\". Naughty Marietta had its first performance on October 24, 1910, in Syracuse, New York,Engle, Sherry Darlene. New women dramatists in America, 1890-1920. p. 164, Macmillan (2007) , accessed April 25, 2010 and opened on Broadway on November 7, 1910, playing for 136 performances at the New York Theatre. It enjoyed revivals in 1929 at Jolson's 59th Street Theatre and in 1931 at Erlanger's Theatre. The operetta became Victor Herbert's greatest success. A film version of Naughty Marietta was released by MGM in 1935 starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. A television version of the operetta was broadcast live in the United States on January 15, 1955, starring Patrice Munsel and Alfred Drake. Synopsis =Act One= In eighteenth century New Orleans, the townspeople go about their daily business in the Place d'Armes (\\"Clear Away!\\"). √âtienne Grandet, the son of the colony's acting governor, has just returned from a trip to France, and the young ladies warn him that the pirate Bras Pique has been attacking ships bound for New Orleans; the town fountain is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a woman he killed. √âtienne, unknown to all but his father and his quadroon slave mistress Adah, is really Bras Pique. He gives his father a share of the profits from his crimes, and his father keeps his identity secret. Sheet music cover to \\"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\\" A band of American woodsmen, farmers, and Indians, led by Captain Dick Warrington and his lieutenant, Sir Harry Blake, \\"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp\\" into town. They vow to capture Bras Pique and seek the governor's signature on a warrant for his arrest. They also hope to find wives among the casquette girls, who should arrive in New Orleans any day. These French girls have been granted dowries by the King of France and sent to the New Orleans to marry the colonists. Lieutenant Governor Grandet, √âtienne's father, refuses to sign the warrant. He knows √âtienne has imprisoned the real governor on a Caribbean island. √âtienne seeks to establish Louisiana as a dictatorship under his own command, separate from both France and the burgeoning United States of America. The Lieutenant Governor oversees the girls' arrival, and the men excitedly introduce themselves (\\"Taisez-Vous\\"). A plain-looking girl, Lizette, is ignored by all the men except the boastful Simon O'Hara, Captain Dick's Yiddish servant. After everyone leaves the square, the fragmented song of the \\"ghost\\" comes from the fountain (\\"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\\"). It is not a ghost singing, but an Italian girl who introduces herself as \\"Naughty Marietta\\". She was one of the casquette girls, but she ran away from the ship at Mozambique and came to New Orleans on her own. Captain Dick, who met her in Mozambique, sees her by the fountain. He agrees to help her hide, but explains that \\"It Never, Never Can Be Love\\" between them. He and the Italian puppeteer, Rudolfo, agree that she can disguise herself as Rudolfo's son and work at his marionette theatre. Marietta tells Dick that it has been foretold that she will love the man who can complete the melody she sang at the fountain, which came to her in a dream. She asks him to try to complete it. He refuses, but finds himself whistling it soon afterwards. Though Lizette ignores Simon, he tries to impress her (\\"If I Were Anyone Else But Me\\"). Adah feels that √âtienne does not love her anymore and tries to see her future in cards (\\"'Neath a Southern Moon\\"). Marietta, disguised as Rudolfo's son, performs an \\"Italian Street Song\\" for the townsfolk. The Lieutenant Governor announces that a dispatch has come from the King of France offering 10,000 francs for the return of the Contessa d'Altena who exchanged places with her maid and traveled to the colonies as a casquette girl. The Contessa always sings a fragment of a certain tune, and the townspeople recognize it as the ghost's song. Sir Harry Blake, Captain Dick's lieutenant, arrives in the square and accidentally betrays Marietta, noting that she is really a casquette girl disguised as a boy. √âtienne insists that Marietta reveal her identity, but she declares that though she is not a boy, she is not the Contessa. Governor Grandet's indecisiveness prevents a fight between √âtienne's guards and Dick's men, and Marietta runs off with Rudolfo. =Act Two= Sheet music cover to \\"I'm Falling in Love with Someone\\" Rudolfo teaches Marietta to work the marionettes (\\"Dance of the Marionettes\\"), and √âtienne asks her to attend the quadroon ball with him, believing that she is the contessa and hoping to marry her (\\"You Marry a Marionette\\"). Dick has warned Marietta that the ball is dangerous for a young girl, but she ignores him because she believes that Dick has been flirting with Adah. She agrees to go to the ball, but not as √âtienne's partner. The ball is representative of everything excessive and decadent in New Orleans (\\"New Orleans, Jeunesse Dor√®e\\"). The attendees are gaily drinking, gambling, and womanizing (\\"The Loves of New Orleans\\"). Lizette is at the ball, still looking for a husband (\\"The Sweet By-and-By\\"). Simon has been appointed whipping boy to the Governor's family and has decided to find a better-looking girl than Lizette: he will complete the Contessa's song, and once she is found, she will marry him. Marietta is shocked by the obvious immorality of the ball and asks √âtienne to take her home. When Captain Dick arrives, she assumes he intends to see Adah. Though he tells her he has come to protect her, she declares she will \\"Live for Today\\" and dance with √âtienne. Lizette attempts to spark Simon's jealousy by flirting with the Governor, but Simon ignores her. √âtienne proposes to Marietta; a marriage to a contessa would legitimize his plan for a Louisiana republic under his control. She asks what he will do with Adah, and he says he will auction her. Marietta leaves him and finds Dick, who realizes he may be in love with her (\\"I'm Falling in Love With Someone\\"). √âtienne auctions Adah at the ball, and Dick buys her so she will not be unhappy with an old and ugly master. Marietta jealously agrees to marry √âtienne, announcing that she is the lost Contessa d'Altena. The quadroon girls and Marietta leave to prepare for the wedding. Adah remains with Dick, and he sets her free. She gratefully tells him that if he tears √âtienne's right sleeve he will reveal √âtienne's real identity: Bras Pique. Simon revels in the glory of his new job (\\"It's Pretty Soft for Simon\\"). Dick tears off √âtienne's sleeve and denounces him as the notorious pirate. However, he cannot legally arrest √âtienne because Simon, as the family whipping boy, is obligated to take any punishment destined for Grandet family members. The guards carry Simon off and Lizette brokenheartedly follows. Adah tells Marietta about √âtienne's true identity, and so she refuses to marry him. The Governor threatens to send her to a convent and locks her in a room. She hears a voice outside completing her song, \\"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\\". It is Dick, and they embrace through the window. √âtienne discovers them, but Captain Dick's infantry appears before he can take action. They have freed Simon and have come to arrest √âtienne and the rest of the pirates. √âtienne relinquishes his claim on Marietta, as Dick and Marietta join together in \\"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\\". Dick and his men allow the pirates to escape without harm. Musical numbers ;Act I *Overture *1. Clear Away! ‚Äì Opening Chorus *2. Mysterious Melody - Fanchon *3.

Life Otto was the son of Franz Xavier Lehmann, a mathematics teacher in the Baden- Wurtemberg school system, with a strong interest in microscopes. Otto learned to experiment and keep records of this findings. Between 1872 and 1877, Lehmann studied natural sciences at the University of Strassburg and obtained the Ph.D. under crystallographer Paul Groth. Otto used polarizers in a microscope so that he might watch for birefringence appearing in the process of crystallization. Initially becoming a school teacher for physics, mathematics and chemistry in M√ºlhausen (Alsace-Lorraine), he started university teaching at the RWTH Aachen University in 1883. In 1889, he succeeded Heinrich Hertz as head of the Institute of Physics in Karlsruhe. Lehmann received a letter from Friedrich Reinitzer asking for confirmation of some unusual observations. As Dunmur and Sluckin(2011) say :It was Lehmann's jealously guarded and increasingly prestigious microscope, not yet available off the shelf, which had attracted Reinitzer's attention. With Reinitzer's peculiar double-melting liquid, a problem in search of a scientist had met a scientist in search of a problem. The article \\"On Flowing Crystals\\" that Lehmann wrote for Zeitschrift f√ºr Physikalische Chemie addresses directly the question of phase of matter involved, and leaves in its wake the science of liquid crystals.

He served as Dean of the Faculty of Music in the University of London. Early life and education Born at Greenock, Wallace studied ophthalmology at the University of Glasgow, and in Vienna and Paris. He became a qualified ophthalmic surgeon, but was also a poet, dramatist, writer on music and a painter.Biography, Hyperion Records In 1889 he entered the Royal Academy in London to study music with Alexander Mackenzie and Frederick Corder, but after two terms his father withdrew funding. This was the only formal training he had.Barker, Donald J. \\"William Wallace\\", in Grove Music Online, 2001. Career Wallace was greatly influenced by Franz Liszt, and was an early (though not the first) composer of symphonic poems in Britain. His compositions include the symphonic poem, Sir William Wallace (1905; based on his namesake, the freedom fighter William Wallace, one of Scotland's national heroes); a cantata, The Massacre of the Macpherson; and an overture, In Praise of Scottish Poesie (1894). He also wrote a Creation Symphony (1899), influenced by numerology. He was inspired by Maurice Maeterlinck's play, Pell√©as and M√©lisande, to write music by the same name. Wallace wrote several books on music, including the following: *The Threshold of Music: An Inquiry into the Development of the Musical Sense (1908); *The Musical Faculty (1914); *Richard Wagner as he lived (1925) *Liszt, Wagner and the Princess (1927) He served as secretary of the Royal Philharmonic Society from 1911 to 1913, during which time the society received its royal appointment.Foreman, Lewis (ed.)

The station was part of the Wymondham to Wells Branch (1847 - 1989), and is part of a section of the line being restored by the Mid-Norfolk Railway from Dereham to County School railway station. History The station was equipped with a single passenger platform on the down line. This line was flanked by a goods loop. The station was rebuilt by the London & North Eastern Railway, with a simple brick building replacing the earlier timber framed building. Passenger trains were not permitted to pass at this station. A collision took place close to the station on 14 December 1882.Accident Returns: Extract for the Accident at North Elmham - Dereham on 14th December 1882 =Goods trains= North Elmham was the location for a rail served dairy, with daily milk trains operating from the station to Ilford.'Thanks for the Memory', Mike Esau A shunting horse was used at Elmham to move loaded milk wagons from the down to the up side of the line for collection. The dairy closed in October 1963. The station also dealt in grain and fertilizer traffic. Present day Some materials are currently on site from the former Cambridge - St Ives railway to construct a new platform in preparation for the opening of the MNR's northern section for passengers. Construction of a new platform and the pace of track restoration between Hoe and North Elmham which relies on volunteer labour and charitable donations. It had been proposed that there could be an additional halt built between this location and Dereham in the small hamlet of Hoe, a popular location for walkers. The Mid-Norfolk Railway's volunteers are instead concentrating efforts on restoring the line progressively towards North Elmham. Although there are no passenger train services near this station at this time, a Transport Works Order (The Mid-Norfolk Railway Order 2001) is in place allowing the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust to operate trains from Dereham up to approximately 550m north of the station where an old railway buffer stop is located.

It represents the views of Canadian Health sciences librarians to governments, the health community and fellow librarians. Background The genesis of the CHLA/ABSC can be traced to the Annual Meeting of the Medical Library Association which was held in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975. The Canadian Group of the MLA met there (it was its second meeting, having been founded the year before) on June 2 and established an \\"Ad hoc committee to study the organisational status of Canadian health librarians.\\" The formation of this ad hoc committee arose at this meeting (it was not specifically on the pre-circulated agenda), as it was clear that the proliferation of Canadian health library groups was not in the best interests of Canadian health sciences librarians. It was important then, as now, that Canadian health librarians spoke with one authoritative voice but there were at the time three \\"national\\" groups (four if one counted the French-speaking Section de la sant√© of ASTED). These other groups were the Special Resource Committee on the Medical School Libraries of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges. This grouped then, as now, the Directors of Canadian medical schools under the aegis of the ACMC. The ACMC group had been officially formed in 1967 and first met in 1968 but was actually the successor to the Canadian Library Association's Committee on Medical Science Libraries that had been founded in 1961. The second group which was active in 1975 was the Health Sciences Section of CASLIS (the Canadian Association of Special Libraries and Information Services) ‚Äì itself a sub-group of the Canadian Library Association. This was a spin-off of and partial successor to the Committee on Medical School Libraries noted above. The third group was the Canadian Group of the Medical Library Association. This group had been formed in 1974 as a way to formalise the links between Canadian members of the MLA and the MLA.administration. At the meeting of the Canadian Group in 1975 it was proposed that an ad hoc committee be established to look at the situation and propose improvements. The Canadian Group of MLA chaired by Dick Fredericksen, then the Health Sciences Librarian at Memorial University of Newfoundland, voted overwhelmingly to establish a committee with a rather broad mandate: \\"To survey local health science library groups across the country; to discover the gaps existing; to locate key personnel.\\" David S. Crawford from McGill University was appointed to chair this group and authorized to select its membership. The association's records are held at the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at McGill University in Montreal. Founding Members The members selected were Dick Fredericksen, Sheila Swanson (then the Librarian of the Academy of Medicine, Toronto and the chair of the CASLIS Group), Ann Nevill (then Head of the Health Sciences Resource Centre at CISTI), Martha Stone (then Head of the library at the Department of National Health and Welfare), Dorothy Sirois (then the Librarian at the Montreal Children's Hospital and a link with ASTED's Section de la sant√©). Subsequently, in October 1975, Alan MacDonald, who had been much involved in the creation of the Canadian Association of Law Librarians and had recently been appointed Health Sciences Librarian at Dalhousie University, joined the ad hoc committee as a second representative from CASLIS. In February 1976, Philippe Lemay, recently appointed to head the HSRC, replaced Ann Nevill. In June 1976 the Medical Library Association Canadian Section (meeting in Minneapolis) and the CASLIS Section, meeting in Halifax both accepted the report of this ad hoc Committee. The MLA Canadian Group accepted it (34 voted in favour, one against) with one amendment; this was to remove the capitalisation from the proposed name \\"in case a better name is suggested\\"! The ad hoc committee continued their discussions over the summer of 1976 and accepted further suggestions and comments from the community. It met for the last time on 4 October 1976 and agreed that there was enough support to form a Canadian health libraries association. No better name had been suggested and the agenda for this meeting notes, \\"It seems we are left with Canadian Health Libraries Association, the addition of 'Sciences' was not well received at the CASLIS meeting.\\" Subsequently, the Canadian Group of the MLA and the Health Sciences Section of CASLIS have both disbanded and the CHLA / ABSC works closely with the Committee on Medical School Libraries of the renamed Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. There is an article by David S. Crawford (CHLA's first President), reprinted from the Association's journal, Bibliotheca Medica Canadiana, describing the formation of the Association.

The system under test may be composed of hardware, or software, or hardware with embedded software, or hardware/software with human-in-the-loop testing. SIT consists, initially, of the \\"process of assembling the constituent parts of a system in a logical, cost-effective way, comprehensively checking system execution (all nominal & exceptional paths), and including a full functional check-out.\\" Following integration, system test is a process of \\"verifying that the system meets its requirements, and validating that the system performs in accordance with the customer or user expectations.\\" In technology product development, the beginning of system integration testing is often the first time that an entire system has been assembled such that it can be tested as a whole. In order to make system testing most productive, the many constituent assemblies and subsystems will have typically gone through a subsystem test and successfully verified that each subsystem meets its requirements at the subsystem interface level. In the context of software systems and software engineering, system integration testing is a testing process that exercises a software system's coexistence with others. With multiple integrated systems, assuming that each have already passed system testing,What is System integration testing? SIT proceeds to test their required interactions. Following this, the deliverables are passed on to acceptance testing.  Software system integration testing  For software SIT is part of the software testing life cycle for collaborative projects. Usually, a round of SIT precedes the user acceptance test (UAT) round. Software providers usually run a pre-SIT round of tests before consumers run their SIT test cases. For example, if an integrator (company) is providing an enhancement to a customer's existing solution, then they integrate the new application layer and the new database layer with the customer's existing application and database layers. After the integration is complete, users use both the new part (extended part) and old part (pre- existing part) of the integrated application to update data. A process should exist to exchange data imports and exports between the two data layers. This data exchange process should keep both systems up-to-date. The purpose of system integration testing is to ensure all parts of these systems successfully co-exist and exchange data where necessary. There may be more parties in the integration, for example the primary customer (consumer) can have their own customers; there may be also multiple providers. = Data driven method = A simple method of SIT which can be performed with minimum usage of software testing tools. Data imports and exports are exchanged before the behavior of each data field within each individual layer is investigated. After the software collaboration, there are three main states of data flow.  Data state within the integration layer  Integration layer can be a middleware or web service(s) which acts as a medium for data imports and data exports. Data imports and exports performance can be checked with the following steps: # Cross-checking of the data properties within the Integration layer with technical/business specification documents. #* For web service involvement with the integration layer, WSDL and XSD can be used against web service request for the cross check. #* Middleware involvement with the integration layer allows for data mappings against middleware logs for the cross check. # Execute some unit tests. Cross check the data mappings (data positions, declarations) and requests (character length, data types) with technical specifications. # Investigate the server logs/middleware logs for troubleshooting. Reading knowledge of WSDL, XSD, DTD, XML, and EDI might be required for this.  Data state within the database layer  System integration testing of a database layer might proceed as follows: # First check whether all the data have committed to the database layer from the integration layer. # Then check the data properties with the table and column properties with relevant to technical/business specification documents. # Check the data validations/constrains with business specification documents. # If there are any processing data within the database layer then check Stored Procedures with relevant specifications. # Investigate the server logs for troubleshooting. Knowledge in SQL and reading knowledge in [stored procedures] might be required for this  Data state within the application layer  There is not that much to do with the application layer when we perform a system integration testing: # Mark all the fields from business requirement documents which should be visible in the UI. # Create a data map from database fields to application fields and check whether necessary fields are visible in UI. # Check data properties by some positive and negative test cases. There are many combinations of data imports and export which we can perform by considering the time period for system integration testing. Testers must select best combinations to perform with the limited time and when repeat some of the steps to test those combinations.

Miramontes was born in Tepic, Nayarit. He obtained his first Degree in chemical engineering at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM). He was a founding researcher of the Institute of Chemistry of UNAM, specializing mainly in the area of Organic Chemistry. He was a professor of the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, Director and professor of the School of Chemistry at the Universidad Iberoamericana, and deputy Director of Research at the Mexican Institute of Petroleum (IMP). Miramontes was a member of diverse scientific societies, such as the American Chemical Society (Emeritus), the Mexican Institute of Chemical Engineers, the National Institute of Chemical and Chemical Engineers, the Chemical Society of Mexico, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the New York Academy of Sciences. He died in Mexico City in 2004. Invention and synthesis of norethisterone The scientific contributions of Luis Miramontes are extensive, including numerous publications and nearly 40 national and international patents in different areas such as organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, petrochemistry and atmospheric chemistry and polluting agents. Among his multiple contributions to world science is the synthesis on October 15, 1951, when Miramontes was only 26 years old, of norethisterone (norethindrone), that was to become the progestin used in one of the first three oral contraceptives (combined oral contraceptive pills).

Djerassi himself affirms that it was, in fact, Miramontes who conducted the very last step of the first synthesis of the compound: \\"On 15 October 1951, Luis Miramontes, a young Mexican chemist doing his undergraduate bachelor's thesis work at Syntex completed the synthesis of the 19-nor-17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone or, for short 'norethisterone'‚Äîwhich turned out to be the first oral contraceptive to be synthesized. Lecture audiences are always intrigued when I display a slide showing the carefully dated and hand-written lab protocol of the very last step in that synthesis conducted by Miramontes, in which the elements of acetylene are added to impart oral activity.\\"Carl Djerassi. This Man's Pill: Reflections on the 50th Birthday of the Pill. Oxford University Press 2001. The scientific article reporting the synthesis of 19-nor-17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone (norethisterone) has Miramontes as the second author. Finally, the very last step of the synthesis method was registered, on October 15, 1951, in page 114 of the Miramontes's personal laboratory notebook (signed). In a 2006 essay published in the FASEB Journal, the director of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology said: \\"Another aspect of the Nobel Prizes that is a perennial topic of discussion concerns those discoveries, inventions, or advances that go unrecognized altogether. One is the birth control pill. I have just mentioned the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research, where pioneering work by Gregory Pincus and M. C. Chang was carried out in the 1950s that led to the first birth control pill. Pincus died in 1967 at age 63. The tributaries flowing into the development of the oral contraceptive were numerous and temporally distributed across two decades, going back to the extraction of a substance from the roots of a jungle plant by Russell Marker that was readily convertible to pregnanediol and then to progesterone in two steps, the subsequent chemical synthesis of progestins by Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes, and George Rosenkranz, and the discovery by Gregory Pincus and M.C. Chang at the Worcester Foundation that a compound sent to be tested by the G. D. Searle Pharmaceutical Company was, contrary to expectations, a potent anti-ovulatory progestin.\\" Recognition Patent of the first oral contraceptive, elected to the USA Inventors Hall of Fame. *In 1964, the contraceptive pill was chosen by the US Department of Patents as one of the 40 registered more important inventions between 1794 and 1964. The name of Luis Miramontes appeared next to Pasteur, Edison, Bell, the Wright brothers and others of equal stature. It was included in the \\"USA Inventors Hall of Fame\\". *In 1985 he received the \\"Estado de Mexico\\" Medal, in the area of sciences and arts; as well as a public recognition from the government of the state of Nayarit, and an academic recognition from the Technological Institute of Tepic. *He received the Mexican National Prize on Chemistry \\"Andr√©s Manuel del Rio\\" in 1986. *In 1989 he became a \\"pugwashite\\", that is, member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, organization promoting peace and world development, after attending the 39th Pugwash Conference: Building Global Security through Cooperation held at Cambridge, USA . The Pugwash Conferences were awarded the Peace Nobel Prize in 1995. *In 1992 the General Hospital of Zone no. 1, of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, in Tepic, Nayarit, was named \\"Luis Ernesto Miramontes Cardenas Hospital\\". *In 1994 the Mexican Ministry of Health recognized his scientific contributions, when installing the National Program on Family Planning in Mexico. *He received in 1998, on behalf of the government of the state of Nayarit, the \\"Amado Nervo\\" Medal.

He was professor of harmony and composition at the Royal Academy of Music, London, from 1898 to 1924, and principal from 1924 to 1936. He was a prolific composer, but made few efforts to bring his music to the notice of the general public.  Life and career  =Early years= John Blackwood McEwen was born in Hawick in 1868, the son of James McEwen and his first wife, Jane, n√©e Blackwood. James McEwen was a Presbyterian minister; he moved to a church in Glasgow, where his son grew up.Dibble, Jeremy, \\"McEwen, Sir John Blackwood (1868‚Äì1948)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2013. Retrieved 15 November 2017 McEwen gained an MA degree from Glasgow University in 1888, between then and 1891 he studied music while working as a choirmaster, first in Glasgow and later at Lanark parish church.Thatcher, Reginald. \\"McEwen, Sir John Blackwood (1868‚Äì1948), principal of the Royal Academy of Music\\", Dictionary of National Biography archive, 1959. Retrieved 15 November 2017 In 1891 he moved to London to gain wider musical experience,\\"Obituary: Sir John McEwen\\", The Times, 17 June 1948, p. 7 and by 1893 he had composed two string quartets, three symphonies, a Mass and other works.\\"John Blackwood McEwen\\", The Musical Times, 1 July 1948, pp. 221‚Äì222 In that year he entered the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), where he studied with Ebenezer Prout, Frederick Corder and Tobias Matthay.Benoliel, Bernard. \\"McEwen, John\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 15 November 2017 While a student at the RAM McEwen won the Charles Lucas medal,\\"Royal Academy of Music\\", The Musical Times, 1 August 1895, pp. 528‚Äì529 and had his First String Quartet played at one of the academy's concerts.\\"Royal Academy of Music\\", The Musical Times, 1 July 1895, pp. 469 Two years later he returned to Scotland, as a teacher of piano and composition at the Athenaeum School of Music (later the Royal Scottish Academy of Music) and choirmaster of South parish church, Greenock. =Professor and principal= In 1898 McEwen accepted an invitation from Sir Alexander Mackenzie, principal of the RAM, to become professor of harmony and composition. He held the post for the next 26 years. Among his students were the composers William Alwyn, Dorothy Howell and Priaulx Rainier. He was known as an exacting teacher, who emphasised discipline, but encouraged a liberal aesthetic outlook in his pupils.Obituary: Sir John McEwen\\", The Manchester Guardian, 18 June 1948, p. 3 In 1902 McEwen married Hedwig Ethel Cole (1878 or 1879‚Äì1949), daughter of Henry Alwyn Bevan Cole, naval architect. There were no children of the marriage. In 1905, together with Frederick Corder and Tobias Matthay, McEwen co-founded the Society of British Composers; he also served as president of Incorporated Society of Musicians He held radically egalitarian political views, and wrote a series of left-wing tracts, including Abolish Money and Total Democracy. In 1924, on Mackenzie's retirement, McEwen was appointed principal of the RAM. The Manchester Guardian said of his tenure that although he did not go out of his way to seek popularity among his students and staff, \\"his unfailing loyalty and integrity won him the respect of all those who came into touch with him\\". In 1926 he received the honorary degree of DMus from Oxford University. He was knighted in 1931, and retired in 1936. McEwen died in 1948 in London, aged 80. His widow died the following year. He bequeathed the residue of his estate to the University of Glasgow to help promote the performance of chamber music by composers of Scottish birth and descent. Music McEwen's biographer Jeremy Dibble writes that the composer's orchestral music shows an indebtedness \\"to the highly coloured, post-Wagnerian palette of Strauss, Skryabin, and the late French Romantics such as Chausson, Dukas, and Charpentier ‚Ä¶ a late-Romantic propensity that even extended to 'Sprechgesang' in the Fourteen Poems for 'inflected voice' and piano (1943).\\" Dibble comments that McEwen's large output of chamber music \\"reveals a creative mind disposed towards more abstract, polyphonic thought.\\" Bernard Benoliel, in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that McEwen's music \\"synthesizes Scottish (and sometimes French) folk idioms and the Romantic legacy of Berlioz, Liszt, Wagner, and the French and Russian schools; Debussy was particularly influential\\". Dibble writes that In the Three Border Ballads (1905‚Äì8) the composer's \\"mastery of form and orchestration, backed by a powerful emotional impetus, rivals mature Elgar\\". McEwen's best-known orchestral work was the Solway Symphony of 1922; it was the first British symphony to be recorded for the gramophone. He wrote a Viola Concerto for Lionel Tertis, described by The Times after its premiere in 1901 as \\"interesting and very well written\\".\\"Mr McEwen's Concert\\", The Times, 27 May 1901, p. 9 The consensus of critics is that McEwen's finest works are his chamber compositions. McEwen's music achieved little public recognition, partly because he rarely sought it. Dibble remarks that he was \\"seemingly unconcerned about the dissemination of his own works\\". Despite that, McEwen nevertheless did much to further the cause of other British composers, particularly as a prominent member of the Royal Philharmonic Society in the years between the First and Second World Wars. In recent years Chandos Records has revived many of McEwen's works, issuing three CDs of large-scale pieces including A Solway Symphony, Hills o\`Heather for Cello and Orchestra, Where the Wild Thyme Blows, Three Border Ballads, and Hymn on the Morning of Christ's Nativity; three more CDs of McEwen's string quartets; and a single CD of solo piano music.\\"John McEwen\\", Chandos Records. Retrieved 18 November 2011 McEwen wrote two musical text-books: Exercises on Phrasing in Pianoforte Playing, and The Principles of Phrasing and Articulation in Music . The Musical Times considered that his chief literary contribution was The Thought in Music: An Inquiry into the Principles of Musical Rhythm, Phrasing and Expression.

He was the founder of the Lee Foundation and one of the richest men in Southeast Asia in the 1950s and 1960s. He was also the son-in-law of Tan Kah Kee, another well-known Chinese businessman and philanthropist based in Southeast Asia. Early life Lee was born in Furong Village, Nan'an, Fujian Province towards the end of the Qing dynasty of China. His father was Lee Kuo Chuan (). He received his early education in private schools in his hometown. In 1903, at the age of 10, he came to Singapore, then a British colony, to join his father. Lee studied at the now defunct Anglo-Tamil School and Chung Cheng High School. Lee returned to China in 1909 to complete his education under a scholarship, but it had to end in 1911 as the Xinhai Revolution broke out. In China, Lee studied at Chi Nan College in Nanjing and later the Railway and Mining College in Tangshan, which was then one of the top colleges in China and a forerunner of the present-day Southwest Jiaotong University and North China University of Science and Technology. Upon returning to Singapore, Lee worked as a teacher at Tao Nan School and as a translator at a Chinese- language newspaper company. He also worked as an assistant field surveyor with the Public Works Department. In 1915, he joined the China Guohua Company owned by Tan Kah Kee, and became Tan's prot√©g√©. He was promoted to manager of the Tan Kah Kee Rubber Company in 1917. Three years later, he married Tan's daughter, Tan Ai Leh (). Career Seven years later, Lee set up his own rubber smoking house in Muar, Johor, Malaya, which became the Nam Aik Rubber Company in 1928. His enterprises of rubber planting and manufacture, pineapple planting and canning soon expanded to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo, Indonesia and Thailand. He was known as \\"Southeast Asia's Rubber and Pineapple King\\". He became one of the richest men in the region, with the Lee Rubber Company becoming a multimillion-dollar business which he started in 1931. His brother George Lee joined him at the company. At the height of their fortune, the company's worth was estimated to be S$600 million. Lee also went into banking. He became the general manager and vice-chairman of Huayi Bank. In 1933, he was appointed as the vice- chairman of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), a corporation formed from the merger of three Chinese banks. = Supporting education = In 1934, Lee became the chairman of the board of directors of The Chinese High School (now Hwa Chong Institution), a post he held until 1957. In 1939, Lee founded Guozhuan Primary School in his hometown, Furong Village. In 1941, Lee donated his properties in River Valley, Singapore for the establishment of Nan Chiau Teachers' Training College (present Nan Chiau High School). He gave lectures in Columbia University during World War II while he was stranded in the United States. Lee became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore) and donated S$1 million for the development of a medical college on the college's grounds. Other institutions received financial support from the Lee Foundation, including the National University of Singapore, Anglo-Chinese School, St. Margaret's Secondary School, Methodist Girls' School, Singapore Chinese Girls' School, Tao Nan School, Anglican High School and The Chinese High School. The Lee Kong Chian School of Business of the Singapore Management University was named in his honour. Like Tan Kah Kee, Lee poured his wealth into education and other philanthropic work. He set up the Lee Foundation in Singapore in 1952 and in Malaya in 1960. In 1965, the Lee Foundation Limited was established in Hong Kong. Lee spearheaded free public library services for the nation when he donated S$375,000 through the Lee Foundation to allow the Singapore government to build the Old National Library building at Stamford Road. Between 1952 and 1993, the Foundation donated sums amounting to S$300 million to various causes with no conditions attached. Later life Statue of Lee Kong Chian in front of Kong Chian Administration Centre, Hwa Chong Institution. Lee's work and generous contributions to education and society were recognised. He was conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Malaya in 1958. In 1964, Malaysia's Yang di-Pertuan Agong (head of state), Putra of Perlis, awarded Lee the title Panglima Mangku Negara (PMN), hence Lee was known by the honorific Tan Sri. Prior to that, Lee had been made Dato' by the Sultans of Johor and Kelantan in 1957 and 1959 respectively. He became the chairman of OCBC Bank in 1938 and remained in that position until his death. In 1965, Lee was conferred another honorary degree, Doctor of Letters, by the University of Singapore in recognition of his services to the university and his contributions to arts and education. Legacy Lee died in 1967 and is survived by three sons and three daughters. =Places named after Lee Kong Chian= * Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, National Library, Singapore * Lee Kong Chian Wing, University Hall, National University of Singapore * Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, National University of Singapore * Lee Kong Chian Centre for Mathematical Research, National University of Singapore * Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University * Lee Kong Chian Lecture Theatre, Nanyang Technological University * Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University * Lee Kong Chian Faculty of Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman * Tan Sri Lee Kong Chian Hall, Methodist College Kuala Lumpur * Kong Chian Administration Centre, Hwa Chong Institution * Kong Chian Library, Hwa Chong Institution (High School Section) * Lee Kong Chian Gardens School, LGS-MINDS * Lee Kong Chian Library, Anglican High School * Kong Chian Hall, Nan Chiau High School * Lee Kong Chian Auditorium, Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) * Kong Chian Hall, SJK(C) Cheng Siu 1 *Kong Chian Hall, Kuala Lumpur Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall *Kong Chen Hall, Chong Hwa Independent High School, Kuala Lumpur =Places named after Lee Kong Chian's father= There are also some places named after Lee's father, Lee Kuo Chuan, including: * Kuo Chuan Avenue, a road in Singapore's Marine Parade district * Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School * Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School * Heritage Centre, Hwa Chong Institution (High School Section), previously known as Kuo Chuan Art Centre * Lee Kuo Chuan Stadium, Anglican High School *SRJK (C) Kuo Kuang (ÂõΩÂÖâÂõΩÊ∞ëÂûãÂçéÊñáÂ∞èÂ≠¶) No. 1 and SRJK (C) Kuo Kuang No. 2 - Two Chinese medium primary school in Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, named after the combination of middle names of Lee 'Kuo' Chuan and Lee 'Kong' (Kuang) Chian.

Due to the First World War she never entered NDL service. She had a career after the war first under White Star Line control, then briefly as the troop ship USS Zeppelin, next as the Orient SN Co liner SS Ormuz and finally back with NDL as SS Dresden. Troop ship SS Zeppelin was launched on 9 June 1914, and on completion she was handed over to NDL on 21 January 1915. By then the First Battle of the Atlantic of the First World War was under way so NDL laid her up at Bremen until the end of hostilities. On 28 March 1919 she was surrendered as war reparations to the UK Government, who placed her under the management of the White Star Line. She was then handed over to the United States Navy, who commissioned her as USS Zeppelin and assigned to the New York Division of the Transport Force with Commander William W. Galbraith as her master. USS Zeppelin made two round-trip voyages between the United States and Europe, returning 15,800 American soldiers back home. She then returned to Europe, was decommissioned on 25 November 1919 and returned to United Kingdom control on 27 December 1919. Civilian liner The UK Government sold her to the Orient Steam Navigation Company in 1920, who renamed her SS Ormuz and had her refitted as a passenger liner. Orient line placed her in service on the route between Great Britain and Australia, on which she began her first sailing from Britain on 12 November 1921. In 1927 NDL bought Ormuz back and had her refitted to upgrade much of the third class accommodation to first class or tourist class. NDL renamed her SS Dresden and placed her in service on the Bremen - New York route for which she had originally been built. KdF cruise and loss SS Dresden sunk in Boknafjord, 1934. In 1934 the Nazi Kraft durch Freude organization started operating tourist cruises. KdF chartered Dresden and she sailed on her first KdF cruise on 11 June 1934. On 20 June she struck a rock off \\"Aregrunden\\" on the Norwegian island of Bokn. She was refloated but as a precaution was beached near Blikshavn on the island of Karm√∏y. In the early hours of 21 June she listed to port and the Norwegian \\"hurtigrute\\" ship, DSD (Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap) 874 ton Kong Haakon, was one of those which took off her passengers. One life was lost in an accident during the transfer to the passenger ship. 4 people lost their life total. Other ships involved in the rescue of the 323 crew and 975 passengers were the French inspection vessel Ardente and the Norwegian ships Kong Harald, Kronprinsesse Martha, Kvits√∏y and Stavanger. A firm of shipbreakers from Stavanger broke up the ship where she lay. Remnants of the wreck remain near the shore, between and depth.

Since completing a BBC production traineeship in 2000 during which he worked on Paul Robeson: Speak of Me as I Am, he has directed documentaries on a number of subjects, from arts and music to geopolitical issues for the BBC and Channel Four. For several years he was associated with Yeastculture, a group of filmmakers and video artists that made music videos for live stage shows and for art installations as well as TV documentaries. In 2003, his first feature documentary The Leech and the Earthworm co-directed with Marc Silver screened at international film festivals. That same year, The End of the Line, his fictional short (made with the help of the UK Film Council New Cinema Fund, Screen East and Tilt Films) which starred Miriam Margolyes and David Oyelowo was nominated for best short at the Rushes Soho Shorts Festival and selected for several other international festivals. In 2005, he directed the short psychological drama Blackout, as well as a series of other documentary films about the rise to power of the left-wing in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. These four feature-length films were shown at film festivals globally and the director and producers were invited to present talks and lectures at universities and political summits in many countries. Max Pugh's feature collaboration as film editor with Michael Nyman, NYman with a Movie Camera, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and Barbican Hall in London in 2010 before being moving to the Berlin Film Festival, Turin, Sydney, Morelia and MOMA New York in 2011. The film has been screened around the world in 2012 in a new version. In August 2013 the film opened as an 11-screen video installation at Summerhall during the Edinburgh Festival. The installation then travelled to Art Basel in Miami, and Zona Maco in Mexico City.

Though Lawson was primarily a landscape painter, he also painted a small number of realistic urban scenes. His painting style is heavily influenced by the art of John Henry Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, and Alfred Sisley. Though considered an American Impressionist, Lawson falls stylistically between Impressionism and realism. Youth Ernest Lawson, New England Birches Ernest Lawson - Spring Night, Harlem River - Landscape Ernest Lawson was born in 1873 in Halifax, Nova Scotia to a prominent family, and arrived in the United States in 1888 and settled in Kansas City. In 1891, he went to live in New York and enrolled in classes at the Art Students League, studying under John Twachtman, who introduced him to Impressionism and was the central influence of his formative years. He later continued to study with Twachtman and with J. Alden Weir at their Cos Cob, Connecticut summer art school in the 1890s. \\"To some degree,\\" one art historian has noted, \\"Lawson was a product of the art colony movement.\\"Wierich, p. 78. Lawson visited France in 1893 and studied at the Acad√©mie Julian with Jean-Joseph Benjamin- Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens. He practiced plein air painting in southern France and at Moret-sur-Loing, where he met the English Impressionist Alfred Sisley. In 1894, Lawson exhibited two paintings in the Salon. Lawson shared a Paris studio that year with W. Somerset Maugham, who is believed to have used Lawson as the inspiration for the character \\"Frederick Lawson\\" in his 1915 novel Of Human BondageNorma J. Roberts (ed.), \\"Ernest Lawson,\\" in The American Collections (Columbus: OH: Columbus Museum of Art, 1988), p. 52. Back in the United States, he married his former art teacher, Ella Holman.Perlman, p. 105. Maturity Excavation - Penn Station, oil on canvas, 1906. Weisman Art Museum, University of Minnesota--Minneapolis Upon his return to the United States in 1896, Lawson began developing his own aesthetic. He was further encouraged by Robert Henri, William Glackens, and the other independent artists with whom he began to associate around 1903. Lawson moved to Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan in 1898, and his work for the next two decades focused on subjects‚ÄîFort Tryon Park, the Harlem River, Spuyten Duyvil, the fields, bridges, docked boats, tree-covered hills, and rocky inclines at the edge of a city on the move‚Äîfrom that still-unpopulated part of the metropolis. His paintings form a \\"procession of lonely vistas devoid of people,\\"Perlman, p. 102. but are filled with an almost tactile sense of paint and an understated chromatic brilliance. (Art critic James Gibbons Huneker, a great admirer of Lawson, referred to his friend's skill as originating in a \\"palette of crushed jewels.\\") Like other realists, he worked on-site and traveled with some frequency in search of interesting new subjects; his search for the picturesque took him to Spain, New Hampshire, Nova Scotia, Kansas, Colorado, Tennessee, New Mexico, Connecticut, and Florida. Lawson had his first solo exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1907 and won a prize in the Academy's Annual for a winter landscape, the theme of which became his single most identifiable subject. The following year, he joined the rebellious group that would become known as \\"The Eight,\\" whose members included Robert Henri, William Glackens, John Sloan, George Luks, Everett Shinn, Arthur B. Davies and Maurice Prendergast. The Eight In many ways, Ernest Lawson was an unlikely rebel. A soft-spoken, gracious, and undramatic man, he had no flair for self-promotion and little inclination to paint the rougher aspects of modern city life, which was a hallmark of five of the most significant members of the Eight. (Henri, Glackens, Sloan, Luks, and Shinn were all founding members of what became known as the Ashcan school of American art.) Unlike Henri, Sloan, and Luks, who were teachers as well, he had no worshipful student-following nor was he well-placed in art-political circles in New York, like Arthur B. Davies. He had his devoted fans‚Äîthe Manhattan restaurateur James Moore (the central figure in William Glackens's famous painting, Chez Mouquin) owned a much-loved collection of LawsonsJohn Loughery, John Sloan: Painter and Rebel (New York: Henry Holt, 1995), p. 129.‚Äîbut no one thought of him as a radical in any way. If anything, he had more in common with the eighth member of the group, Maurice Prendergast, in his steady reserve and quiet professionalism. But he did share the concerns voiced by Henri and others of the group that the exhibition system in New York, a closed system that led to wider press coverage and lucrative sales for those who worked in an approved manner, was too much a \\"private club\\" enterprise and needed shaking up. The exhibition that the Eight staged at the prestigious Macbeth Galleries in New York in 1908 did just that. The exhibition of The Eight was the \\"succ√®s de scandale\\" its organizers hoped for. If sales did not quite measure up to their expectations, the painters nonetheless became centers of media attention for some time. Conservative tastes were affronted, and young artists flocked to the Macbeth Galleries to see a startling range of modern representational art. The show later traveled to Chicago and Boston, where it occasioned more press coverage and public discussion of the direction American art should take. Lawson and his friends had played a role in an important cultural event and in initiating debate about a needed diversity of style and subject matter in American art.Sam Hunter, Modern American Painting and Sculpture (New York: Dell, 1959), pp. 38-39. At the same time, though, it was possible for some people to wonder to what extent Lawson was an outsider at all. Later that year, he was named an associate member of the National Academy of Design, and he was made a full academician in 1917. He exhibited as a member of the Canadian Art Club from 1911 to 1915. He benefited from regular gallery representation, won many prizes throughout his career, and was highly regarded by his peers. In fact, William Merritt Chase considered him America's greatest landscape painter, an endorsement that carried a healthy cachet with it.Perlman, p. 102. None of this translated into wealth or fame in the long run, however. Lawson had financial problems all his life and suffered from poor health in his later years. Lawson was invited to contribute three paintings to the landmark Armory Show of 1913. Like many American artists at the time, he was not prepared to abandon representational art for the new paths suggested by Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism, but he was open to learning more about Post-Impressionism (which he had first been exposed to in Europe), and in New York the opportunities to see the Post-Impressionists increased considerably after the Armory Show. \\"Acquaintance with C√©zanne's painting convinced [Lawson] that Impressionism had lost contact with form in its insistence upon surface light, and in his later works he made an obvious attempt to recapture solidity. Although he never completely assimilated C√©zanne's structural methods, Lawson managed to introduce a measure of form into his art and some resemblance to the Aix master...as he dropped the coloristic haze and the pastel prettiness inherited from Twachtman.\\"Brown, p. 61. Later years Though his work was sought after by important collectors in the 1910s and 1920s, such as John Quinn, Duncan Phillips, Albert C. Barnes, and Ferdinand Howald, who single-handedly built the modern collection of the Columbus Museum of Art, Lawson did not maintain a high profile in the American art world as Precisionism, the artists of the Alfred Stieglitz circle (e.g., Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, Charles Demuth), and other adventurous movements and individuals took center stage.Brown, p. 81. Even an essentially sympathetic art historian like Milton Brown states the case bluntly: \\"Lawson continued on his honest but pedestrian course.\\" Eventually, he left New York. Lawson visited Florida when he befriended Katherine and Royce Powell, his close friends and patrons who lived there. He first stayed with them in Coral Gables in 1931, and he returned there often, moving permanently to Florida in 1936. In his last years, he completed a post office mural in Short Hills, New Jersey (no longer extant), but he focused primarily on painting the Florida landscape. Depressed and in declining health, he drowned under mysterious circumstances in 1939, apparently while swimming on Miami Beach. Friends wondered if Lawson's death had been a suicide.Loughery, p. 334. Lawson's work is little-known today compared to that of many of his friends and associates, but his best paintings can be found in the collections of many American art museums. Robert Henri insisted that, among landscape artists, he was \\"the biggest we have had since Winslow Homer.\\"Wierich, p. 80. Duncan Phillips referred to him as a \\"great romanticist.\\"Wierich, p. 84. Aside from their qualities as well-made landscapes, Lawson's works have an interesting secondary life today as a record of the twilight of pastoral Manhattan. The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, in Lawson's 1903 painting of that title, is being erected in the midst of a woodland not far from the campus of Columbia University and the roar of the El. His Washington Heights of springtime foliage and glens and rowboats is today a thriving Dominican neighborhood, robustly urban, packed with people and buildings, subject of the Broadway musical In the Heights. Lawson's paintings remind viewers of a world that vanished entirely in the space of a few decades. Notes Sources *Berry-Hill, Henry and Sidney.Ernest Lawson: American Impressionist 1873-1939.

Dr. Armond H. Seidler (1919-2017) of the University of New Mexico invented the Pugil Stick training method during World War II. It was initially adopted by the United States Marine Corps, but was later included in United States Army combat training as well. Dr. Seidler received an award from the Marine Corps for his invention. Pugil bouts are usually conducted with hard contact while wearing protective gear such as groin protectors, American football helmets, hockey gloves, and chest protectors or shin guards, such as those worn by baseball catchers. Some pugil sticks are made with integrated hand guards to reduce the potential for injury. Military procedures for pugil bouts are often detailed, with United States Army and United States Marine Corps both prohibiting pugil training by anyone who has recently suffered concussion of the brain, lest they suffer traumatic brain injury, or had a tooth extraction within the past 24 hours. Pugil stick sparring was popularized in the United States by the American Gladiators, a physical game show which ran from 1989 to 1996, and again in the 2008 revival, as well as in the British version. In the \\"Joust\\" contest, competitors would try to knock each other off pedestals using pugil sticks.

The drop shadow is often used for elements of a graphical user interface such as windows or menus, and for simple text. The text label for icons on desktops in many desktop environments has a drop shadow, as this effect effectively distinguishes the text from any colored background it may be in front of. A simple way of drawing a drop shadow of a rectangular object is to draw a gray or black area underneath and offset from the object. In general, a drop shadow is a copy in black or gray of the object, drawn in a slightly different position. Realism may be increased by: # Darkening the colors of the pixels where the shadow casts instead of making them gray. This can be done with alpha blending the shadow with the area it is cast on. # Softening the edges of the shadow. This can be done by adding Gaussian blur to the shadow's alpha channel before blending. Inset drop shadows are a type which draws the shadows inside the element. This allows the interface element to appear as if it is sunken into the interface.  Use  Stacking window managers draw a window border around the windows, while compositing window managers draw drop shadow around the windows Generally, window managers which are capable of compositing allow drop shadow effects, whereas incapable window managers do not. In some operating systems like macOS, drop shadow is used to differentiate between active and inactive windows. Websites are able to use drop shadow effects through the CSS properties box shadow, text shadow, and filter. , drop- shadow() filter function, Mozilla Developer Network The first two are used for elements and text respectively, while the drop shadow filter additionally to the element's content, letting it support oddly shaped elements or transparent images.

Ranked 12th in the world and 2nd in Asia by the QS World University Rankings in the subject of Education in 2015, the institute is the sole teacher education institute for teachers in Singapore. NIE provides all levels of teacher education, ranging from initial teacher preparation, to graduate and in-service programmes, and courses for serving teachers, department heads, vice-principals and principals. Its enrolment stands at more than 5,600 full- time equivalent students. The institute was first established as the Teachers' Training College in 1950. Programmes NIE is organised into Programme Offices with 12 supporting Academic Groups. The Office of Teacher Education administers the initial teacher preparation programmes, leading to diploma, degree and postgraduate diploma qualifications, to equip student teachers with the knowledge to lead in the service of learners. The Office of Graduate Studies and Professional Learning offers master‚Äôs and doctoral degrees. The office also delivers in-service and leadership programmes to enhance the career pathways of serving teachers and educators. The External Programmes Office was set up in October 2005 to act as an educational consultancy to meet the bespoke training requirements of local and international clients. In July 2009, this Office was renamed as NIE International, a private company and a subsidiary of NIE/NTU. Research NIE established the Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice in 2002 with funding from the Ministry of Education (MOE). As the largest education research centre in the Asia Pacific, the centre sits in the Office of Educational Research. It brings together researchers, educators and administrators research in and to develop new and innovative ways of teaching and learning. In January 2005, NIE established the Learning Sciences Lab which is now part of the Office of Educational Research. The Lab aims to lead and transform pedagogy enabled by ICT in teaching and learning in Singapore schools. From a research base, findings and good ideas are conceptualised and applied in learning processes so that these are effectively implemented in the schools.  History  The roots of NIE can be traced back to the Teachers' Training College (TTC) that was established in 1950, to meet the pressing need for teachers in Singapore. Between 1950 and 1971, the role of producing teachers was shared by the TTC and the School of Education at the University of Malaya (predecessor of the University of Singapore). TTC entered a new relationship with the University of Singapore in 1971, and resulted in the establishment of IE (Institute of Education) in 1973. The College of Physical Education (CPE) was set up in 1984 by IE to train specialist teachers in Physical Education. In 1991, IE and CPE merged to form NIE or the National Institute of Education. They occupied the campus at Bukit Timah Road, before moving to the main campus of the Nanyang Technological University in 2000. International recognition QS World University Rankings by Subject of Education 2013 published by Quacquarelli Symonds ranked NIE 10th in the world and 2nd in Asia ahead of top education faculties such as University of California, Berkeley and University of Toronto. One of NIE‚Äôs executive programmes, the Leaders in Education Programme (LEP), has attracted international attention. The six-month programme prepares senior education officers for principalship. NIE received endorsement of its five-year strategic plan by an MOE-appointed International Advisory Panel, comprising academics from overseas universities, in August 2007. Additionally, Singapore‚Äôs education system and teacher education programmes were ranked among the world‚Äôs best in a report by McKinsey and Company in September 2007. Student clubs The NTUSU consists of 16 constituent bodies, of which the Trainee Teachers' Club is one. Only student teachers who are members of the NTUSU are eligible for full membership of the Trainee Teachers' Club. Student teachers of NIE other than those defined under ordinary membership and students from other schools in NTU may apply for affiliate membership subject to the approval of the Management Committee and recommendation of the Advisor of the Club. The main role of the Trainee Teachers' Club is to promote and safeguard the interests and welfare of student teachers in NIE, as encapsulated by its vision To Serve, to Provide, and Unite. The Club achieves this by: promoting vibrancy on campus for a safe and lively environment that student-teachers feel at home in; organizing events that lend a sense of vibrancy and active student life; and refining initiatives that care for the needs and wants of student-teachers in NIE. The Club also functions as the core vessel of communication between the students, subsidiary clubs, and NTU- NIE administration. Regardless of race, language, religion, and other lines of divide, the TTC takes pride in upholding equal treatment and equality for all student-teachers in NIE. The Trainee Teachers' Club comprises the following sub-clubs and societies: * Chinese Language Education and Research (CLEAR) Club * Club ArNex * Club Jeux * Club Sci¬∑napse * DanceFuzion (DF) * Deixus * Food and Consumer Sciences (FCS) Club * Malay Language & Cultural Society (MLCS), NTU * Physical Education and Sports Science (PESS) Club * Service Learning Club (SLC) * Tamil Language Club (TLC) * Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) Club * Graduate Student Club (GSC) Together with its sub-clubs and societies, the Trainee Teachers' Club organises a range of social, sports, cultural and educational activities for all student teachers.

Sue Ellen was portrayed by Linda Gray and appeared on the show since its pilot episode, first broadcast on April 2, 1978. Dallas followed the trials of the wealthy Ewing family in the city of Dallas, Texas, into which Sue Ellen married when she wed J.R. Ewing. Gray played Sue Ellen until the twelfth season of Dallas, when her character finally leaves Texas after beating J.R. at his own game, seen in the 1989 episode \\"Reel Life\\". However, Gray later returned for the 1991 series finale \\"Conundrum\\", the subsequent Dallas telemovies (J.R. Returns in 1996 and War of the Ewings in 1998). She returned to the role again for the 2012 continuation series of Dallas, which ran until 2014. Sue Ellen's storylines in the season 2 focused on the character's bout with alcohol and her slowly deteriorating relationship with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on the birth of her son with J.R., John Ross Ewing III. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: \\"I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before ‚Äì she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting.\\" Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, \\"one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls.\\" For her work as Sue Ellen, Gray was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category \\"Best Actress in a Drama Series\\" in 1981 (Barbara Bel Geddes who played Miss Ellie Ewing was also nominated in that category for Dallas that year). Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of \\"Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series ‚Äì Drama\\" respectively. In 2010, TNT (sister company to Warner Bros. Television, the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing a new, updated Dallas series. It was a continuation of the original series and primarily centered around Sue Ellen and J.R.'s son John Ross Ewing III, and Bobby and Pamela's son Christopher Ewing, though various stars of the original series reprised their roles. Gray agreed to return to the new series and once again assumed the role of Sue Ellen. Character portrayal and development =Casting and creation= When Gray originally tested for Dallas, the role of Sue Ellen was merely that of a background character. The actress recounts that the part was a \\"mere walk-on\\" and there hadn't been any need for a formal audition. In fact, Gray had to do an impromptu audition over the telephone because the role was not considered important enough to bring in another actor to test for the part, though the actress later stated that Newhart innkeeper Mary Frann was also considered to play the character while the producers were casting the show. In an interview with TV Guide, Gray confirmed: \\"She [Frann] had the part. Victoria Principal was a brunette, and so was I, and Mary was a blonde, and [the producers] wanted that [visual] contrast. But the casting director [who had only recently tapped me to play a transsexual on All That Glitters] kept bugging them until they finally said, 'OK, we'll read her.'\\" Once the show was picked up for a full season, Gray and fellow actor Steve Kanaly (Ray Krebbs) were both upgraded to starring roles.Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap, pp. 24‚Äì25 After staying with the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she requested the producers of the show to adjust her contract to allow her to direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, \\"The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show.\\" We'll drink to that!\\" The actress also recounted the story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: \\"I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode in the next two year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, \\"What!?!\\" I told him, \\"They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here.\\" He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me.\\" Gray remained a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its 12th season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things. In 2010, TNT (sister company to Warner Bros. Television, the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing a continuation of Dallas. The new series primarily centered around Sue Ellen and J.R.'s son John Ross Ewing III, and Bobby Ewing's adopted son Christopher Ewing, though various stars of the original series reprised their roles. Gray agreed to return to the new series, once again to play Sue Ellen. =Characterization= Linda Gray as Sue Ellen in the fifth season of the series. In 1979, Gray spoke with TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: \\"At first, they had no idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch.\\" However, Gray was upgraded to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on- screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it \\"terrible\\", though he denied it. She joked, \\"I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [to the motel where everyone was staying]. I swear to you‚Äîhe devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!\\" Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often suffered emotional abuse from her husband J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show. Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, \\"one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls.\\" She also added, \\"The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end.\\" In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: \\"It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. But I still say she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties.\\" The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented, > I loved my drunk scenes. I know that may sound very strange to people! I got > to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was > like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I remember being in makeup > for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in > my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, \\"Just let me go, > please don't edit me, just let me go.'\\" She added, \\"It was just one of those > charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just > wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was > the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something > and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or > drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that > box' In an interview with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: > I never wanted her to be boring.

Character arc =Original series= Linda Gray has said that she considers Sue Ellen \\"one of the most interesting female characters on television in the 1980s\\". When the 20-year-old Sue Ellen Shepard wins the title of Miss Texas in 1967, she meets her future husband, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who is a judge for the pageant. After a courtship, they marry in 1971, but after several years, their marriage deteriorates, due in large part to J.R.'s numerous extramarital affairs and his disinterest in her. In 1978, a lonely Sue Ellen begins an affair with J.R.'s nemesis, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval). Shortly thereafter, Sue Ellen finds herself pregnant and believes that Cliff is the father because she and J.R. had been married for years without conceiving, and by this point, they barely had marital relations. Sue Ellen believes she loves Cliff, but is unable to leave J.R. To console herself, she starts drinking heavily during her pregnancy. Worried about the safety of her unborn child, J.R. has Sue Ellen committed to a sanitarium in 1979, to gain sobriety. However, Sue Ellen manages to continue drinking and escapes from the sanitarium drunk and crashes a car. While in the hospital, she gives birth to a son, John Ross Ewing III. After her son's birth, Sue Ellen becomes severely depressed and shows no interest in the child. She then begins an affair with rodeo cowboy Dusty Farlow (Jared Martin) and enters into psychiatric treatment. Eventually, she gains the strength to connect with her child. After Cliff sues for paternity of the baby, tests reveal that J.R. is in fact the biological father. Sue Ellen, meanwhile, makes plans to leave J.R. for Dusty; however, Dusty is reportedly killed in a plane crash, and this news sends Sue Ellen back to the bottle. In 1981, Sue Ellen learns that Dusty is in fact alive but has been horribly crippled as a result of the plane crash. Nonetheless, Sue Ellen remains dedicated to her love for him and leaves J.R., taking their son with her to live at the Southern Cross Ranch, the home of Dusty's father, Clayton Farlow (Howard Keel). Sue Ellen divorces J.R. and gains custody of John Ross, but her relationship with Dusty ends when he regains the use of his legs and decides to resume his life's passion as a rodeo cowboy. Sue Ellen then moves back to Dallas with her son and enters into another short-lived romance with Cliff. When J.R. gets wind of this, he becomes jealous and courts Sue Ellen himself in an effort to win back custody of his son, and, in the process, obtain his voting shares in Ewing Oil, the family oil company. In 1982, J.R. and Sue Ellen remarry, but their happiness is short-lived as J.R. quickly returns to his philandering ways and Sue Ellen catches him in bed with oil tycoon Holly Harwood (Lois Chiles). However, Sue Ellen decides to remain married to J.R., in name only, but moves out of his bedroom. In 1983, Sue Ellen enters into an affair with college student, Peter Richards (Christopher Atkins), who had been her son's camp counselor. In 1984, Sue Ellen miscarries a child, but doesn't know whether J.R. or Peter is the father. When J.R. learns of Sue Ellen's affair, he arranges for Peter to be arrested on trumped-up drug charges and blackmails him to leave Dallas for good. In 1986, Sue Ellen goes into business by buying a partnership interest in a lingerie company. She successfully lures J.R.'s latest mistress, Mandy Winger (Deborah Shelton), away from J.R. by offering her a promising career as model and then as an actress. Sue Ellen and J.R. enjoy a brief reconciliation; however, J.R.'s desire to regain Ewing Oil by having an affair with Kimberly Cryder (Leigh Taylor-Young) destroys what is left of their marriage. Sue Ellen decides to leave J.R. for good, but he manages to take John Ross away and put him into hiding in a boarding school. Sue Ellen and her new lover, Nicholas Pearce (Jack Scalia), confront J.R. at his penthouse and demand he tell them where he hid John Ross. A scuffle breaks out between J.R. and Nicholas, which results in Nicholas' being thrown over the balcony and killed. In response, Sue Ellen shoots J.R. three times; however, he lives and neither she nor J.R. is indicted for any crimes. In 1988, Sue Ellen divorces J.R. for a second time. Deciding to get revenge on him, she decides to make a feature film expos√© on her life with J.R., with the help of screenwriter Don Lockwood (Ian McShane). She and Don soon become romantically involved and, in 1989, Sue Ellen moves to London with Lockwood, but not before blackmailing J.R. by threatening to release the film, which would destroy his reputation. In 1991, J.R. learns that Sue Ellen and Don Lockwood have married. John Ross, her son by J.R., later joins her and Don in London. Sue Ellen appears in the final episode of the series during J.R.'s dream in which she is a successful actress married to her previous love, Nicholas Pearce. In 1996, when her marriage to Don is in trouble, Sue Ellen returns to Dallas with her son, after J.R. was reportedly killed in a car accident. When J.R. is discovered alive, Sue Ellen reconciles with him. However, upon learning that J.R. faked his death to manipulate his family, Sue Ellen becomes partners with Bobby in the family company, Ewing Oil, to spite J.R. In 1998, Sue Ellen becomes CEO of Ewing Oil. =Dallas (2012 TV series)= Sue Ellen has become a powerful woman in Dallas, leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans. Her success has led her to run for Governor of Texas, with campaign backers already lining up to support her. But despite this success, Sue Ellen harbors deep regret for her mistakes as a mother raising John Ross and will do anything to make things right for him. Upon seeing J.R. for the first time in years, there is a brief moment of romantic tension and nostalgia. However, Sue Ellen becomes wary of J.R.'s claims of having changed when Cliff Barnes returns to town. Then when a colleague and occasional lover of John Ross's, Veronica Martinez, is pushed off a balcony and killed, Sue Ellen bribes the medical examiner into ruling the death a suicide and finds herself looking for support from Harris Ryland, Ann's ex-husband. Harris later plans to use Sue Ellen's sure win to his advantage and desiring to run a clean office, Sue Ellen seeks Ann's help who later gets a recording of Harris admitting to his crimes and placing him into a spot of submission. In the second season, Harris again gains the upper hand when he offers Ann information about their kidnapped daughter in exchange for the tape, Sue Ellen tells Ann to go ahead. However, her secret bribery comes out on the eve of the election and she loses the election and twelve donors towards her foundation. Facing the possibility of jail and the overall humiliation and disgrace, she pours herself a glass of wine (in the original series, her favorite tipple was Vodka). Yet, before she can drink it J.R. and John Ross arrive, with J.R. vowing to make things right by her and reminding her that she is a strong woman. After they leave she dumps out the wine and instead seeks comfort in Ann. J.R. through means of blackmail is able to get the charges dropped and after thanking him, Sue Ellen invites him in for tea, a spark of their past romance being seemingly reignited. Later she comes to the aid of John Ross and helps him in securing control of the newly established Ewing Energies, by pushing his ex-girlfriend Elena Ramos out of the company. Despite pleas from Bobby, Ann, and Christopher she does so. Then when J.R. is murdered, Sue Ellen becomes heart broken and relapses after his memorial service. She reads a letter he wrote to her and spends the night alone in his room. At his funeral, she reads the letter aloud in which J.R. declares his undying love to Sue Ellen and asks her for another chance. Heartbroken, Sue Ellen reveals her own unresolved feelings for J.R. and declares that had he not been murdered she would have happily reunited with him. She then collapses at his casket and says he was the love of her life. Soon after, Sue Ellen's alcoholism returns, and her struggles with it become a recurring theme in the third season, putting a strain on her relationship with her son. Eventually she learns the truth about the circumstances surrounding J.R's death, and is angered at both Bobby and Bum that she had been kept in the dark about his illness and his final plan, although she makes amends. Reception For her work as Sue Ellen, Gray was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category \\"Best Actress in a Drama Series\\" in 1981 (Barbara Bel Geddes who played Miss Ellie Ewing was also nominated in that category for Dallas that year). Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of \\"Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama\\" respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, \\"Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R.

In appearance it is often a ros√© colour, but is also made as a white wine. It has intense flavours of strawberry and black currants, a characteristic taste often called \\"foxy\\" in wine parlance. The grape varieties used are highly resistant to phylloxera and other diseases; as a result they do not often have to be sprayed with pesticides. They also require little fertilization because of their vigorous growth.  Oenology  The grapes/clusters are usually red, but also (less commonly) white. The varieties used are inter-specific hybrids, which were developed from crossings between the European species Vitis vinifera with the native North American Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia. It is Vitis labrusca which lends the wine its characteristic \\"strawberry\\" flavouring. \\"Uhudler\\" can refer to several varieties and today it is disputed which varieties rank in the \\"Uhudlergruppe\\" (Uhudler group) and which do not. Some of the varieties used include the grapes Concord, Isabella, Elvira, Clinton, Ripatella and Noah.  History  Uhudler originates from the time of the large phylloxera infestations around 1860. The phylloxera aphid reached Europe in 1860 and Austria in around 1900. After the losses of the European grape varieties through phylloxera, many attempts were made to either exterminate the pest or use alternative, non- traditional viticultural practices which would prevail against infestation. In time, disease resistant North American vines (including some used in Uhudler wines) were imported to Europe and used to produce wine. Many crossings between native North American and European varietals were created at this time. The wine produced did not correspond in any way to the established taste trends in Europe. During the early 20th century, however, some fruit from North American vines were blended with that from Vitis vinifera to enhance the \\"fruitiness\\" of the wine. After the discovery that grafting Vitis Vinifera onto native North American rootstocks was a solution to the phylloxera problem in Europe - and in order to allow European wine to regain its place in the first half of the 20th century - North American vines (like those used in \\"Uhudler\\") were forbidden under wine regulations across the European continent. In order to damage the reputations of wines produced from native North American varietals, it was also maintained that these wines contained a high content of methanol, and therefore were injurious to the health of the drinker. By the '70s in Austria, private drinking of the Uhudler was thus quite limited, but production for private consumption was permitted. However, prohibition led to the rising popularity of the beverage. On the basis of the Austrian Wine Law uhudler can be marketed in 8 communities of the Burgenland. Uhudler is made from the varieties Concord, Delaware, Elvira und Ripatella. Because of the enormous aggravation of the Austrian wine law due to the wine scandals of the middle of the 1980s, Uhudler was forbidden. This situation continued up to the beginning of the 1990s. During this time thousand of litres of Uhudler (particularly in S√ºdburgenland) were destroyed by wine cellar supervisors.

Early life and political career Van Wyck was born in Poughkeepsie, New York. He was a distant cousin of Robert Anderson Van Wyck and Augustus Van Wyck; their common ancestors were Theodorus Van Wyck (1668-1753) and his wife Margretia Brinckerhoff Van Wyck. He completed preparatory studies and graduated from Rutgers College, New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1843. Van Wyck studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1847 and commenced the practice of law. He then moved to Bloomingburg, New York, where he was a district attorney 1850-1856. Van Wyck was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican from New York to the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses (March 4, 1859 - March 3, 1863). He served as chairman, Committee on Mileage (Thirty-sixth Congress) and on the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions (Thirty-seventh Congress). =Assassination attempt= Van Wyck delivered a harsh anti-slavery speech on the House floor on March 7, 1860, which denounced the Southern states for the \\"crime against the laws of God and nature.\\" The speech was widely reported. On February 22, 1861, Van Wyck was assaulted near the United States Capitol by three men in an assassination attempt, an attack which was reported as related to the prior year's speech. Van Wyck fought off the attack, surviving only because a notebook and copy of the Congressional Globe which he had kept in the breast pocket of his coat had blocked the blade of a Bowie knife. The three men fled and were never identified. This was also the same night as an alleged attempt was made to assassinate president-elect Abraham Lincoln in Baltimore, Maryland. Civil War Van Wyck entered the Union Army as colonel of the 56th New York Volunteer Infantry and commanded it during the American Civil War. Part of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign, Van Wyck was wounded in the knee at the Battle of Fair Oaks.

However, after their success in the Lancashire Combination, the club struggled in the new league; the league's first season ended with them finishing in the bottom half of the table for the first time since World War II. They went on to finish bottom of the table in 1973‚Äì74 and again in 1981‚Äì82 and 1982‚Äì83. As a result, the club dropped into Division One of the North West Counties League, which had been formed by a merger of the Lancashire Combination and the Cheshire County League. The club continued to struggle, only avoiding relegation to Division Two in their first season in the league after Ashton United were given a points deduction. After finishing in the bottom four of Division One for the next three seasons, the club were founder members of Division One of the Northern Premier League in 1987. Although Netherfield finished bottom of the new division in their first season, they were not relegated.

One of the leading Ukrainian institutions for higher education, it was founded in 1875 as the Franz-Josephs-Universit√§t Czernowitz when Chernivtsi (Czernowitz) was the capital of the Duchy of Bukovina, a Cisleithanian crown land of Austria- Hungary. Today the university is based at the Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans building complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011. History In 1775, the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy had obtained the territory of Bukovina, which from 1786 was administrated within the Chernivtsi district of Galicia. Under the rule of Emperor Joseph II, the sparsely populated territory was settled by German colonists, mainly from Swabia. Together with the Austrian administrative officials they formed a separate population group and by the late 19th century, several institutes of higher education arose with the German language of instruction, including Gymnasien in Chernivtsi and Suceava. As the graduates still had to leave Bukovina to study in the western parts of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the local administration developed plans to found their own university. =Franz- Josephs-Universit√§t= Archiepiscopal residence, postcard, In 1866, the Austrian Empire had lost the war against Prussia ending the German Confederation, followed by the foundation of the German Empire in 1871. In turn, the Habsburg emperor Francis Joseph I concentrated on strength and displays of power in his eastern crown lands. Plans for a Germanophone university were modelled on the 1872 establishment of the Stra√üburg Kaiser- Wilhelms-Universit√§t, named after German Emperor William I, in annexed Alsace- Lorraine. After the Lviv University had declared Polish teaching language in 1871, a Bukovina committee led by the jurist and liberal politician Constantin Tomashchuk (1840‚Äì1889), a member of the Imperial Council, called for the foundation of a German college in multilingual Czernowitz about \\"beyond\\" Vienna. In 1874 they addressed a petition to the Austrian Minister of Education Karl von Stremayr, on whose proposal Emperor Francis Joseph finally resolved upon the establishment of a university, decided on by the two houses of the Imperial Council on 13 and 20 March 1875. Other cities applying for the creation of a college, such as Trieste, Olomouc, Brno, Ljubljana or Salzburg, were left empty-handed One hundred years after the affiliation of Bukovina to the Austrian monarchy, the Franz-Josephs-Universit√§t was inaugurated on 4 October 1875 (the name day of the emperor) on the basis of the Czernowitz Higher Theological School and Constantin Tomashchuk was appointed its first rector. The ensemble of the Residence, combining elements of national, Byzantine, Gothic and Baroque architecture, is an outstanding example of 19th- century historicist architecture, design and planning, expressing the cultural identity of the Orthodox Church within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally, the main language of instruction was German with separate departments for Ukrainian and Romanian and literature. German was the primary language even though the region it was located in, Bukovina, was not German- speaking, and other Austro-Hungarian universities outside of German-speaking areas were shifting away from German-medium teaching.Strauss, Johann. \\"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\\" (Chapter 7). In: Murphey, Rhoads (editor). Imperial Lineages and Legacies in the Eastern Mediterranean: Recording the Imprint of Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Rule (Volume 18 of Birmingham Byzantine and Ottoman Studies). Routledge, 7 July 2016. , 9781317118442. Google Books PT196-PT197. During the period of Austro-Hungarian rule, the university operated three faculties: Greek Orthodox theology (the only one in Central Europe), jurisprudence and philosophy. To pursue the study of medicine, the Bukovina graduates still had to go to Lviv or to the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. Though the general language of instruction was German, professorships on Romanian and Ruthenian language were also established. At the time of Austro-Hungarian rule, the majority of the Czernowitz students were Jewish and German Austrians, while Ukrainians and Romanians comprised for about 20%-25% of the student body. At times, there were more than 40 German, Ukrainian, Romanian, Polish, Jewish, and Catholic fraternities (Studentenverbindungen) in the city, reflecting its lingual and religious diversity. In World War I, Czernowitz on the Eastern Front was embattled by Austro-Hungarian and Imperial Russian forces, severely affecting the university. Nevertheless, plans for a relocation to Salzburg in the west met with protests by academics like Eugen Ehrlich and Joseph Schumpeter. In June 1918 teaching activities were resumed upon the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Soviet Russia. =Universitatea Regele Carol I= After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Bukovina became part of the Kingdom of Romania and the university was renamed Universitatea Regele Carol I din CernƒÉu≈£i. The current building of the university dates from 1920-22, and was commissioned by the Romanian government. From 1919 to 1940 the university was largely Romanized; the Ukrainian department was abolished, Ukrainian professors were dismissed and instruction was fully switched to Romanian. In 1933, of 3,247 students, there were 2,117 Romanians, 679 Jews, 199 Germans, 155 Ukrainians (decreasing from 239 out of 1671 students in 1920), 57 Poles, 26 Russians and 4 of other nationalities. Ion Nistor, a prominent Romanian historian and one of the most vocal proponents of Greater Romanian nationalism was the university rector for many years. =Chernivtsi State University= Upon the 1940 Soviet takeover of northern Bukovina, the territory was attached to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the primary language in the university was switched to Ukrainian. At that time the original shaped wooden ceiling of the Synod Hall was lost to fire and was replaced in the 1950s. The roof has been gradually replaced using quality colour-glazed roof tiles manufactured according to the original patterns and imported from Austria. The change of function of the ensemble, initially being the Residence of Metropolitans and becoming a university did not unduly affect its authenticity. The university, renamed Chernivtsi State University, was significantly expanded and reorganized. In 1976-1977, the university had 10,000 students and about 500 teachers, 26 specialists and doctors of sciences, about 290 associate professors and candidates of sciences. Teaching of science was greatly increased and the theological department was dissolved and then reopened in 1996. In 1989 the university was named to honour Yuriy Fedkovych, a prominent Ukrainian writer, a native of Bukovina. In the Soviet years, the number of Romanian students at the university declined sharply. In 1991-92, the last year of Soviet rule, the number of Romanian students was only 4.44% (434 out of 9,769). Among teaching faculty, the breakdown by nationalities is as follows: Ukrainian teachers 465 (77.1%), Russians 102 (16.9%), Moldovans 9 (1.4%), Romanians 7 (1.1%), Belarusians 6 (0.9%), etc. =Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University= Since 2000, when the university was awarded National status, it operates under its current name, Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University. By decision of Session of Council of European University Association, held in Brussels on 15 January 2009, Yuriy Fedkovich Chernivtsi National University was granted a full individual membership in European University Association. On June 29, 2011, the 35th Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee decided to include the central building of the University - the former residence of the Metropolitan of Bukovina and Dalmatia, on the World Heritage List. In 2016, according to the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, Bukovyna State Financial and Economic University was affiliated to Chernivtsi National University. The Rector of Chernivtsi National University since April 2019 is Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor Petryshyn Roman Ivanovich. Campuses and buildings Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University consists of 17 buildings, with a total amount of 105 units. The total area is 110.8 thousand square meters, including training buildings - 66 square meters. The architectural ensemble of the main campus of the university, the Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans is included on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Early life Anthony Ellmaker Roberts was born near Barneston Station in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Roberts and Mary Ellmaker. His family moved to Lancaster County in 1804. Growing up, Roberts received the limited education available from the local common school. In 1816, at the age of thirteen, Roberts began working for his uncle Isaac Ellmaker as a clerk in Isaac's country store in New Holland; at the age of twenty, Anthony received a share in the ownership of the store, and continued in the business until 1839. Early political career On October 8, 1839, Roberts was elected on the Democratic Antimasonic ticket as Sheriff of Lancaster County. He then moved to Lancaster City, where he served his three-year term as sheriff from 1839 to 1842. In the fall of 1843, Roberts ran for a seat on the Twenty-Eighth Congress on the Anti-Masonic Party ticket, but he was defeated by the Whig Party candidate, Jeremiah Brown. On May 16, 1850, Roberts was appointed by US President Zachary Taylor as the United States Marshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a position he held until May 29, 1853. Resistance at Christiana =The incident= Just a few months after Roberts was appointed Marshal, the United States Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law as part of the Compromise of 1850. The law put Roberts in a difficult position as a Marshal who was also an abolitionist, because he was expected to enforce laws promoting the return of runaway slaves to the South or risk a fine of one thousand US$ per incident. After many tense incidents in the north between local communities harboring runaway slaves and southern slave owners seeking to reclaim their \\"property\\". An incident arose in which blood was shed: on September 11, 1851, Edward Gorsuch, a Maryland slave owner, came to Christiana in Lancaster County to reclaim a runaway slave named Nelson Ford. A group of runaway slaves in Christiana, headed by William Parker, had formed a vigilante group to protect one another from any attempts by Southern slave owners to enslave them again. Edward Gorsuch soon learned that his former slave was staying with William Parker. He went to William Parker's house along with a small posse to take back the slave he claimed to own. The fugitive slaves, led by William Parker, sounded an alarm, which summoned other blacks as well as some local white abolitionists. As Edward Gorsuch advanced to reclaim his \\"property\\", William Parker led an active resistance, and a small battle ensued. One hour later the incident was over and Gorsuch lay dead. Two days later, Anthony Roberts was on the scene with a detachment of Philadelphia police. Those who participated in the resistance, including the white bystanders, were arrested and put on trial for treason, beginning with Castner Hanway, a white man who was not a Quaker but was sympathetic to Quaker ideals. Thaddeus Stevens took on the case as the defense attorney, while Roberts was responsible for keeping those on trial in custody. =Involvement in the slaves' trial= The prosecuting attorneys held two blacks in \\"voluntary\\" custody for the case. These men discovered Edward Gorsuch's plot to reclaim his slaves the day before the resistance took place and warned William Parker. The prosecution was planning to use their testimony to prove that the Christiana incident was an organized effort to resist the laws of the United States. Two weeks before the trial began, however, the two blacks mysteriously disappeared from custody. The prosecution hinted that Marshal Roberts had let them go, since there was no evidence of a broken lock or use of force in their escape. The defense denied the accusation. Twenty-one years later, William Still, the black leader of the Philadelphia Underground Railroad, revealed the truth. While in custody, the two black men had been identified by their owner as runaway slaves. Still reports that the two men did indeed find a \\"true friend and ally\\" in Roberts. Still clarified the matter further when he wrote in response to the suspicions of the prosecuting attorney with respect to Anthony Roberts: \\"To add now, that those suspicions were founded on fact, will doubtless do him no damage\\". Roberts did other things within his power to sway the outcome of the case. As the Marshal, Roberts was responsible for summoning potential jurors. Robert J. Brent, Maryland's Attorney General, who was part of the prosecution team, later claimed that \\"a large majority\\" of the potential jurors called by Marshal Roberts were \\"unfavorable to a conviction\\". On November 27, 1851, Roberts permitted a Thanksgiving meal to be prepared for all the prisoners, and even joined them in the prison for the meal. The incident caused the Maryland Attorney General to censure Roberts's lack of \\"impartiality\\" and \\"decorum\\". =Scott's testimony= Later in the trial, Roberts participated in another event that had a major role in determining the outcome of the case. A certain black named George Washington Scott was going to offer testimony to the fact that he was at the scene of the battle on September 11, that he saw the men who shot Gorsuch, and that the group was organized to \\"resist all slave holders\\". When called upon to testify in court, however, he changed his story and claimed that he was not present that day (an admission that came as quite a surprise to the prosecuting attorneys). It turned out that the night before, Roberts had allowed several black men into the prison to \\"converse\\" with Scott. Maryland's Attorney General cried foul, and indirectly accused Marshal Roberts of witness tampering, citing the interesting fact that all of the black men in custody had a neat appearance except for Scott who was \\"ragged, dirty, and filthy\\". Despite protests from the prosecution, Scott maintained that he was not at the battle scene and that he had initially lied about being there because he was scared. In the end, Castner Hanway was acquitted. Since his was a test case, the prosecution decided not to prosecute the remaining cases. Late political career In the 1854 congressional election, Thaddeus Stevens put his support behind Roberts as the Know-Nothing candidate for the congressional seat of the ninth district of Pennsylvania. The Whigs were appalled by Roberts' candidacy; an article in the Lancaster Examiner reflects this attitude: Despite such resistance to Anthony Roberts, on October 13, 1854, Roberts defeated his rival and relative, Isaac Ellmaker Hiester, by a vote of 6,561 to 5,371 (with 4,266 votes going to the Democratic nominee). Thus Roberts won Pennsylvania's Ninth District seat in the Thirty-Fourth Congress. That same year, the Republican Party was beginning to form around the central tenet of stopping the spread of slavery. In 1855 and 1856, Roberts was among the leaders who established the Party in Pennsylvania, and he strongly advocated its principles. When his first term in Congress ended, he sought re-election as a Republican, and won a second term. During his second term he served on the Public Buildings and Grounds Committee. Altogether, he served in Congress from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1859, as the first Republican to represent Lancaster County in Congress. He was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1858. Roberts continued in politics as an active organizer of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania. He ran for Mayor of Lancaster in 1867, but was defeated by the Democratic candidate in a city that had strong Democratic support. Roberts' obituary, published in the Clarion on January 24, 1885, states that his actions in Congress \\"were always true to his constituents\\". Other activities Roberts active public life resulted in his appointment to many committees. In 1830 he was part of a committee to distribute remonstrances (protests) in Earl Township, in response to a proposal to form Conestoga County from parts of Lancaster, Chester, and Berks counties. On April 5, 1841, Roberts was chosen as a secretary of a meeting in which citizens of Lancaster adopted resolutions to express their sorrow and grief over the unexpected death of President William Henry Harrison. On June 13, 1848, Roberts was appointed to a committee to solicit contributions to mitigate the losses suffered two weeks earlier in a devastating fire in Allentown. After the death of President James Buchanan in 1868, Roberts was appointed as one of the vice-presidents of a committee to arrange the president's funeral services. Roberts also served for a time as chairman of the visiting committee of the School Board in Lancaster. Roberts owned a lot of real estate in and near New Holland in Lancaster County. He seems to have used his real estate holdings to promote education and the general public welfare. On October 22, 1845, he bought a plot of ground with a brick house on it known as the Methodist Meeting House. Six years later he sold it to the Earl School District. In 1850, he completed construction on what was then the largest dwelling in eastern Lancaster County. The construction's purpose was mysterious until its completion, when Roberts announced that a select school would be opened in part of his home. He also assisted in freeing many pieces of property from rent structures that harmed the common people dwelling in New Holland. In 1860, in the City of Lancaster, he was one of the incorporators of an institution dedicated to providing homes for poor and uncared for children. One biographer notes that \\"[the common people of New Holland] looked upon him as their friend and champion of their rights\\". As a close friend of Thaddeus Stevens, Roberts was designated one of the executors of Stevens' will. Family and late life Anthony Ellmaker Roberts Memorial Stone Anthony Ellmaker Roberts Headstone In 1840, Anthony married Emma Bushong, who was about eighteen years his junior, and they had twelve children. Anthony died in Lancaster City on January 23, 1885, at the age of eighty-one. He was buried in Lancaster Cemetery.

He is the founder of the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival. He is president of the British Automobile Racing Club, Patron of the TT Riders Association and an honorary member of the British Racing Drivers Club, the Guild of Motoring Writers, and the 500 Owners Club. Photography Having had a passion for film and photography since the age of 10, Lord Settrington left Eton College at the first possible opportunity and at 17 worked for the film director Stanley Kubrick on the film Barry Lyndon. In 2012, a major exhibition of his recent photographic work, 'Nature Translated', was staged at the Bermondsey Project Space in London. The exhibition was shown at the Marble Palace, part of the State Russian Museum in St Petersburg, in January 2014 and in Moscow as part of the Moscow Photography Biennale in April 2014. Two new exhibitions of the Duke's photographs were held in early 2015: 'Wood Land' which was held at Venus Over Manhattan Gallery in New York City, and 'Abstract and Intentional' which was held at Hamiltons Gallery in London. Goodwood The Earl of March, as he was then known, moved from London to the family seat Goodwood to take over management of the estate, following the family tradition of the duke handing over management of the estate to the heir apparent when the latter turns forty. Motor sport at Goodwood was started by his grandfather, Freddie Richmond, who opened the Goodwood Motor Circuit in 1948. March established the Festival of Speed at Goodwood House in 1993. He then brought motor racing back to the circuit, which had closed in 1966, with the creation of the Goodwood Revival in 1998. Both events have since become recognised as some of the most unusual, exciting and creative events in the world. The Goodwood Estate covers 12,000 acres to the north of Chichester. The Goodwood Estate Company is a diverse portfolio of businesses which includes: Goodwood Racecourse, a 4,000 acre organic farm, two eighteen hole golf courses, Goodwood Aerodrome and Flying School, and a 91 bedroom hotel. The Group employs over 550 people and attracts 800,000 visitors to the Estate each year. The headquarters of Rolls Royce Motor Cars is also on the Estate.

It is the most important urban, political, technological and economic center of the western region of the state. Its economy is based on livestock raising and agriculture. In recent years it has experienced an economic boom and is one of the fastest growing cities in the state of Bahia if not in Brazil. Location and geography Due to the hot climate in Barreiras, the Rio de Ondas is a tourist point very visited by bathers who seek to refresh themselves and enjoy the natural landscape. Barreiras is located 853 kilometers from Salvador, the state capital, and 622 kilometers from Bras√≠lia, the federal capital. With a population of approximately 120 thousand inhabitants distributed over an area of 7,989 km¬≤, it is an important highway crossroads between the North, Northeast, and the Centerwest of the country. The main highway linking Bras√≠lia with Salvador - called BR 020 from Bras√≠lia to Barreiras and BR 242 from Barreiras to Salvador - passes through Barreiras. There is also an airport with daily flights to Bras√≠lia, Salvador da Bahia and S√£o Paulo. There are no railway connections. Geographically it is located in the basin of the Rio Grande, which flows north-east into the S√£o Francisco River. Several other large rivers - the Rio de Janeiro, the Rio de Ondas, and the Rio Branco - pass through the municipality. History It is not known who founded Barreiras. There is no register of the first inhabitants, either European or Amerindian. The Acro√°s and Chacriab√°s were the tribes that lived along the banks of the Iassua, the name they gave to the Rio Grande. They soon disappeared either by disease or war. What is known is that there were some ranches, some as large as districts in Portugal. Cattle caused the first settlers to penetrate these hostile regions, as the great herds began to advance into unexplored lands, bathed by rivers with clear waters. It was the S√£o Francisco River that first brought explorers up to the vast interior. At the point where the Rio Grande flows into the S√£o Francisco a small settlement called Barras took root. By 1600 adventurers had made their way up the Rio Grande as far as rocks that impeded their further passage. Below these rocks, \\"barreiras\\" in Portuguese, a small community began. The Rio Grande was navigable by small boats, and traders soon arrived in the region to support the cattle industry and the ranches. The village became an agricultural center producing tobacco, beans, corn and manioc. These were exported together with molasses, rum, manioc meal, and leather while European articles, kerosene and coffee were imported - all commerce being conducted by river. By 1850 a cluster of huts supplied the boats that arrived on the river. It was called S√£o Jo√£o de Barreiras. By 1880 it was still only a village of twenty huts made of branches and adobe. The great abundance in the nearby forests of mangabeira, from whose sap rubber was made, was a factor for the growth of the town. The rubber was embarked down river to Salvador. Ten more years of prosperity meant that in 1891 it became a district of the municipality of Angical. Then it became a vila in 1901, with the municipality being created with territory taken from Angical. Finally in 1902 it acquired the status of city, having at the time more than 630 houses and 2,500 inhabitants. In 1928 the second hydroelectric station in Bahia was built in Barreiras. Industries began to come to the region. The city that had been practically stagnant for decades now had packing houses, rice and cotton mills, textile factories, and tanning factories. In 1943 a branch of Banco do Brasil opened its doors, the first bank in the city. The good economic times of Barreiras lasted until 1964. In that year the power plant was closed and the city plunged into chaos. With no means of transport, since the rivers had ceased to be navigable and the airport had been closed, the city remained isolated for almost ten years until the Salvador/Bras√≠lia highway was finished. Soon after, the area received irrigation projects financed by the government, and the city began to develop again. From the decade of the 1970s to the present, the municipality has gone from 20,864 inhabitants to 120,000 and undergone important transformations. It has received public and private investments that have modified the social and economic profile. After 1990 the intense agricultural activity has caused changes in practically all the economic and social sectors. In 1979, the city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Barreiras. Economy Benedita Silveira Street, Barreiras downtown' s. soy plantation Barreiras is a major producer of cereals (soybeans and corn), coffee, cotton, and fruits, as well as cattle raising. Irrigation, the level terrain, and the dry climate with well-defined dry and rainy seasons have made Barreiras a leader in agriculture. Much of the irrigation is done with central pivots. Out of the 10,000 square kilometres total planted, soybeans represent 67%. 900 producers cultivate 6,900 km¬≤, producing 1.5 million tons, which represents 4.5% of the national production. The total planted area in 2003 was 1455.86 km¬≤. Other crops in planted area: *corn: 313.19 km¬≤ *rice: 134.11 km¬≤ *cotton: 136.53 km¬≤ *sugarcane: 4.2 km¬≤ *beans: 45.5 km¬≤ *manioc: 55 km¬≤ *sorghum: 24 km¬≤ Data are from IBGE Barreiras has become an alternative area to coffee production in Brazil. After coffee was introduced eight years ago, the planted area has already surpassed 40.89 km¬≤. The region has a potential area of 1,000 km¬≤ for irrigated coffee, of which 500 km¬≤ have central pivots easily adapted to the planting of coffee. In the harvest of 2003 the production was 11,249 tons. Irrigated fruit has reached excellent results and is competing in national and international markets. The main fruits are papaya, mango, lemons and oranges, guava, and coconut. Production not only supplies the national market but lemons, mangos and papayas are exported to Europe and Canada. The planted area of the fruit is: *papaya: 5.3 km¬≤ *mango: 1.2 km¬≤ *coconut: 2.89 km¬≤ *guava: 0.28 km¬≤ *oranges: 1.33 km¬≤ *lemon: 1.35 km¬≤ *tangerine: 0.55 km¬≤ *grapes: 0.05 km¬≤ Going along with the development of agriculture traditional cattle raising gave way in the 1990s to the use of high technology, with cultivated pastures in corrected areas; the raising of more productive breeds; maintenance of the herd with the use of mineral supplements; periodical vaccination and the use of modern techniques like embryo transfer and artificial insemination to improve the genetic quality; confinement and semi-confinement; the production of early heifers and pastures irrigated by pivot. The bovine herd of the region is estimated in 55,215 head. Beef cattle make up 70% of the herd and the other 30% is dairy cattle. The main breeds raised are: Nelore, Brown Swiss, Frisian, Limmousin, Chianina, Guzer√°, Girolanda, Canchim, Marchigiana, Simental, Jersey and Santa Gertrudis. Infrastructure Barreiras has one retransmitting television station, three radio stations, and several newspapers. There are 27 post offices and 22 thousand telephone terminals installed.

He played college football at the University of the Pacific. High school years Born in San Jose, California, Whelilhan graduated from Santa Teresa High School of San Jose in 1989 and lettered in football, baseball and basketball. In football, as a senior, he passed for 1,314 yards and 11 touchdowns. College years After graduating from Santa Teresa High, Whelihan enrolled at Oregon State University and redshirted his freshman year. In 1990, Whelihan transferred to the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California and played on the Pacific Tigers football team from 1992 to 1994. He ended his college career ranked third on the school's list for completions (300), attempts (591) and TDs (27). NFL and XFL careers The San Diego Chargers drafted Whelihan in the sixth round (197th overall) in the 1995 NFL Draft. Whelihan played his first game in Week 8 (October 16) of the 1997 season, in a 31-3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Replacing Stan Humphries, Whelihan completed 2 of 8 passes for 13 yards. In his second game with San Diego, a 38-31 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 10 (November 2), Whelihan completed 8 of 16 passes for 90 yards and passed for his first NFL touchdown, a 44-yarder to Charlie Jones with 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter. Whelihan replaced Humphries as starter effective Week 10 (November 9) because Humphries suffered concussions. In Whelihan's debut as starter, Whelihan completed 17 of 29 passes for 206 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception in a 37-31 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Whelihan also lost a fumble in the Chargers' own end zone, and Michael Sinclair recovered the fumble for a defensive touchdown. In the last play of the game, Sinclair sacked Whelihan to seal the Seahawks win. Playing for only the first three quarters, Whelihan had a season-low 22.2% completion rate in Week 12 (November 23) against the San Francisco 49ers, completing 4 of 18 passes for 81 yards and 3 interceptions before Todd Philcox replaced him. San Diego finished 1997 with a 4-12 record, including 0-7 with Whelihan as starter. In 9 games (7 starts), Whelihan finished 1997 with 118 of 237 passes completed for 6 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, 21 sacks for 168 lost yards, and 29 rushing yards on 13 carries. Whelihan again was second-string quarterback in 1998, this time behind second-overall draft pick Ryan Leaf. After a Leaf pick-six put San Diego behind by 19, Whelihan replaced Leaf in the Week 4 (September 27) game against the New York Giants. In his first drive of the game, Whelihan made a 41-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Jones; the ensuring extra point cut New York's lead to 28-16. San Diego lost the game 34-16, and Whelihan finished with 6 of 15 completed passes for 97 yards and a touchdown as well as 13 rushing yards in 3 carries. In contrast, Leaf threw 4 interceptions in the game in 15-for-34 passing for 193 yards. In Week 6 (October 11), a 7-6 loss to the Oakland Raiders, Whelihan again replaced Leaf late in the game. Leaf had thrown three interceptions, and Whelihan threw an interception in his first drive. Trailing 7-6 and on 4th-and-6 on Oakland's 38 with 42 seconds left, Whelihan completed a screen pass to Natrone Means, but Means fell six inches short of the first down. After Leaf completed only 4 of 15 passes with an interception in Week 10 (November 8), Whelihan replaced Leaf and had a better performance: 13 of 23 completed passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. San Diego lost 27-10 to defending champion and this season's eventual champion Denver Broncos. Effective Week 11 (November 15), Whelihan was starter on a permanent basis. San Diego finished 1998 5-11, just one game better than in 1997; Whelihan had a 2-5 record as starter. Both of Whelihan's wins were by one point: 14-13 over Baltimore Ravens in Week 11 and 38-37 over Kansas City Chiefs in Week 12 (November 22). In Week 11, Whelihan completed 15 of 42 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and Whelihan improved in the next game with 19-for-37 passing for 279 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception. A five-game losing streak followed those two wins. In the season finale on December 28 against the Arizona Cardinals, Arizona linebacker Kwamie Lassiter intercepted Whelihan four times; one of Lassiter's interceptions bounced off Chargers receiver Ryan Thelwell. With 16 seconds left on 4th-and-20, Thelwell caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Whelihan, and the extra point tied the game at 13. However, Chris Jacke kicked the winning field goal as time expired, and Arizona's win qualified the team for the playoffs for the first time in nearly 15 years. The Chargers cut Whelihan after the 1999 preseason. On January 6, 2000, Whelihan signed with the Oakland Raiders. After training camp, the Raiders cut Whelihan. Whelihan played in the XFL in 2001. He began the season with the Memphis Maniax; stuck at third string behind Jim Druckenmiller and Marcus Crandell, the league transferred Whelihan to the Chicago Enforcers midseason to replace Tim Lester. In Chicago, he largely served as a backup to Kevin McDougal. Arena Football League career Whelihan played for three different Arena Football League teams: the Orlando Predators (2001-2002, 2004), the Indiana Firebirds (2003), and Las Vegas Gladiators (2005-2006). After Orlando started 0-3, Whelihan led the Predators to a four-game winning streak by June 2001. Whelihan finished the 2001 season with 224 of 377 passes completed for 3,004 yards, 60 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. Whelihan spent the entire 2002 season on injured reserve. In 2003, the Predators traded Whelihan to the Indiana Firebirds. In four games (with two starts), Whelihan completed 42 of 73 passes for 461 yards, 6 touchdowns, and 3 interceptions. Whelihan returned to Orlando as a backup in 2004 and completed just 7 of 18 passes for 50 yards. Whelihan signed with the af2 team San Diego Riptide on January 27, 2005. Never playing a game for the Riptide, Whelihan returned to the AFL in March 2005 and signed with the Las Vegas Gladiators. With Las Vegas, Whelihan started 2 of 14 games and was mainly a holder when not a starter. He completed 58 of 92 passes for 684 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions. In 2006 with the Gladiators, Whelihan played all 16 games and started 5 and made 131 of 223 passes for 1,677 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions as well as 5 rushing touchdowns. On October 29, 2006, Whelihan signed as a free agent with the San Jose SaberCats, the AFL team in his hometown of San Jose. In 2007, he served as the backup quarterback and holder for the ArenaBowl XXI champion San Jose SaberCats. Coaching career In 2003, Whelihan became quarterbacks coach at La Costa Canyon High School of Carlsbad, California. He continued in that position until 2005. Whelihan also studied for a teaching credential in physical education.

It is best attested in classical Athens, though other sources provide evidence for the ritual mourning of Adonis elsewhere in the Greek world, including Hellenistic Alexandria and Argos in the second century AD. Athenian festival In Athens, the Adonia took place annually, and was organised and celebrated by women. It was one of a number of Athenian festivals which were celebrated solely by women and addressed sexual or reproductive subjects ‚Äì others included the Thesmophoria, Haloa, and Skira. Unlike these other festivals, however, the Adonia was not state-organised, or part of the official state calendar of religious celebration, and prostitutes as well as respectable women celebrated the Adonia. Over the course of the festival, Athenian women took to the rooftops of their houses. They danced, sang, and ritually mourned the death of Adonis. They planted \\"Gardens of Adonis\\" ‚Äì lettuce and fennel seeds, planted in potsherds ‚Äì which sprouted before withering and dying. After the rooftop celebrations, the women descended to the streets with these Gardens of Adonis, and small images of the god; they then conducted a mock funeral procession, before ritually burying the images and the remains of the gardens at sea or in springs. The rites observed during the festival are not otherwise paralleled in ancient Greek religion; like Adonis himself they probably originated in the Near East. =Date= The date of the Adonia at Athens is uncertain, with ancient sources contradicting one another. Aristophanes, in his Lysistrata, has the festival take place in the early spring of 415 BC, when the Sicilian Expedition was proposed; Plutarch puts the festival on the eve of the expedition's setting sail, in midsummer that year. Theophrastus' Enquiry into Plants (Œ†ŒµœÅŒπ œÜœÖœÑœâŒΩ ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ±) and Plato's Phaedrus are both often taken as evidence for the Adonia having been celebrated in the summer. In Egypt and Syria in the Roman period, the Adonia coincided with the rising of the star Sirius in late July. As the Sicilian Expedition sailed in June 415, this contradicts both Aristophanes' and Plutarch's dating of the Adonia; the Athenian Adonia must have been celebrated at a different time. Modern scholars disagree on which of these sources is correct. Many agree with Plutarch, and put the festival around midsummer, though Dillon argues that Aristophanes' placement of the festival near the beginning of spring is \\"without question\\" correct. Some scholars, such as James Fredal, suggest that there was in fact no fixed date for the Adonia to be celebrated. =Gardens of Adonis= The Gardens of Adonis (1888) by John Reinhard Weguelin depicts the casting of the gardens of Adonis into the sea at the end of the Adonia. The main feature of the festival at Athens were the \\"Gardens of Adonis\\", broken pieces of terracotta which had lettuce and fennel seeds sown in them. These seeds sprouted, but soon withered and died. Though most scholars say that these gardens withered due to being exposed to the heat of the summer, Dillon, who believes that the Adonia was held in the spring, says that the plants instead failed because they could not take root in the shallow soil held by the terracotta shards. In support of this, he cites Diogenianus, who says that in the Gardens of Adonis, seedlings \\"wither quickly because they have not taken root\\".Diogenianus, Œ†Œ±œÅŒøŒπŒºŒπŒ±Œπ ŒîŒ∑ŒºœâŒ¥ŒµŒπœÇ, 1.14 In ancient Greece, the phrase \\"Gardens of Adonis\\" was used proverbially to refer to something \\"trivial and wasteful\\". Outside Athens Outside of Athens, a celebration of Adonis is attested in Hellenistic Alexandria, in Theocritus' 15th Idyll. The festival described by Theocritus, unlike the one celebrated in Athens, was a cult with state patronage. It included an annual competition between women singing dirges for Adonis. Rites lamenting the death of Adonis are also attested in Argos in the second century AD: the Greek geographer Pausanias describes the women of Argos mourning Adonis' death at a shrine inside the temple of Zeus Soter. Also in the second century, On the Syrian Goddess, attributed to Lucian, describes an Adonia celebrated in Byblos. There is no mention of Gardens of Adonis at this festival, but ritual prostitution and mystery rites are involved in the celebrations. Laurialan Reitzammer argues that the festival described by Lucian is one that was brought back to Syria from Greece, rather than being of native Syrian origin.

Their task is to be \\"prepared to respond immediately to any type of radiological accident or incident anywhere in the world\\".  History  Concerns over scenarios involving nuclear accidents or incidents on American soil are not recent. As early as the 1960s, officials were concerned that a nuclear weapon might be smuggled into the country, or that an airplane carrying a nuclear weapon might crash and contaminate surrounding areas. In late 1974, President Gerald Ford was warned that the FBI received a communication from an extortionist wanting $200,000 () after claiming that a nuclear weapon had been placed somewhere in Boston. A team of experts rushed in from the United States Atomic Energy Commission but their radiation detection gear arrived at a different airport. Federal officials then rented a fleet of vans to carry concealed radiation detectors around the city but forgot to bring the tools they needed to install the equipment. The incident was later found to be a hoax. However, the government's response made clear the need for an agency capable of effectively responding to such threats in the future. Later that year, President Ford created the Nuclear Emergency Search Team (NEST), which under the Atomic Energy Act is tasked with investigating the \\"illegal use of nuclear materials within the United States, including terrorist threats involving the use of special nuclear materials\\". One of its first responses was in Spokane, Washington on November 23, 1976. An unknown group called the \\"Days of Omega\\" had mailed an extortion threat claiming they would explode radioactive containers of water all over the city unless paid $500,000 (). Presumably, the radioactive containers had been stolen from the Hanford Site, less than 150 miles (240 km) to the southwest. NEST immediately flew in a support aircraft from Las Vegas and began searching for non-natural radiation, but found nothing. No one ever responded, despite the elaborate instructions given, or made any attempt to claim the (fake) money, which was kept under surveillance. Within days, the incident was deemed a hoax, though the case was never solved. To avoid panic, the public was not notified until a few years later.  Today  According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, NEST has the ability to deploy as many as 600 people to the scene of a radiological incident, though deployments do not usually exceed 45 people. NEST has a variety of equipment (weighing up to 150 tons) and has the support of a small fleet of aircraft which includes four helicopters and three airplanes, all outfitted with detection equipment. When an airborne response to an incident is underway, the Federal Aviation Administration grants NEST flights a higher control priority within the United States National Airspace System, designated with the callsign \\"FLYNET\\".  Capabilities  Since 1975, NEST has been warned of 125 nuclear terror threats and has responded to 30. All have been false alarms. While it is common belief that NEST does not have the technology to accurately detect nuclear threats within the noise of natural radiation, in fact it has had the capability to distinguish between man-made and natural radiation since the 1970s. At first, there were still some problems with this simple distinction, as man-made radiation also includes such things as medical radiation. A man under treatment for Graves' disease with radioactive iodine set off alarms in the New York City subway. After being strip-searched and interrogated he was sent on his way.\\"Radio-too- Active: Medical radiation is causing unexpected problems\\", The Economist. 2004-12-02. Retrieved 2012-10-21 Since its initial creation, the detection equipment has been improved and now data can be processed accurately enough to home in on the activity of any single nuclear element desired. In popular culture NEST is mentioned in the motion pictures Broken Arrow, The Peacemaker, The Manhattan Project, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout, Atomic Train and Vishwaroopam, as well as in the made-for-television film Special Bulletin and the television series 24 and NCIS: Los Angeles. NEST also appears in the books Gideon's Corpse by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, The Fifth Horseman by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, and The Sum of All Fears by Tom Clancy. NEST is mentioned in the first-person shooter video game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, when a nuclear threat was suspected in the Middle East, as well as the stealth action game Metal Gear Solid. NEST is featured somewhat prominently in an episode of the television series Castle when a dirty bomb is found in New York City. The need for a NEST team is raised in an episode of the television series The Blacklist when it is learned that a group of operatives the protagonists are seeking are in fact nuclear weapons placed somewhere within the U.S. One of the main characters of Zanky≈ç no Terror (Terror in Resonance) is a NEST researcher. NEST appears as a possible player character profession in the role-playing game Delta Green in the 2019 sourcebook The Complex.

Ahmanson & Co. was a California holding company named after millionaire Howard F. Ahmanson Sr. It was best known as the parent of Home Savings of America, once one of the largest savings and loan associations in the United States. Early history Howard Fieldstead Ahmanson, the company's founder, was born in Omaha, Nebraska on July 1, 1906. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Considered by his father to be a genius by the age of five, Ahmanson founded the H.F. Ahmanson company in 1927, before graduating from the University of Southern California. Ahmanson's company specialized in casualty insurance and quickly became the largest underwriter in California. During the Great Depression, the company prospered by dealing with foreclosures. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Ahmanson once remarked that he felt like an undertaker: \\"the worse it got, the better it was for me.\\" In 1943, Ahmanson bought control of Omaha-based National American Insurance Company. His father had previously owned National American, but the Ahmanson family had lost control of it after his father's death in 1925. Post World War II era & 1950s After World War II, the American housing market expanded tremendously, especially in California. In 1947, Ahmanson purchased the Home Building and Loan Association, a savings and loan association with assets of less than $1 million, for $162,000. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Home Savings then became the cornerstone of H.F. Ahmanson & Company. In the decade that followed, Ahmanson acquired 18 additional institutions, merged them under the name Home Savings and Loan, and turned the group into a financial giant. Prior to the 1950s, mortgage lenders often earned extra income by tying fire insurance policies to mortgages. New laws passed by states in the late 1940s began to limit this tying relationship. The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division launched an investigation of H.F. Ahmanson in the mid-1950s, but the investigation was dropped. Alternate Link via EBSCO. H.F. Ahmanson also formed the Ahmanson Bank and Trust Company in 1957, the National American Title Insurance Company in 1958, and the National American Life Insurance Company of California in 1961. 1960s H.F Ahmanson continued to grow at a furious pace until the 1960s, when the housing market began to falter and the federal government began to pass legislation designed to regulate the savings and loan industry. In 1965, the Ahmanson Company shifted its mortgage emphasis from tract housing to apartment buildings and was able to avoid most of the problems that other savings institutions faced. Howard Ahmanson viewed the collapse as good for the industry because homes were being built too quickly. Ahmanson likened this industry-wide correction to \\"a good laxative that cleaned out the system when it could afford to be cleaned.\\" On June 17, 1968, while traveling in Belgium with his second wife Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson and his son, Howard Ahmanson suffered a heart attack and died. Fortune Magazine estimated Ahmanson's financial worth at the time at between $200 and $300 million, most of it controlled by trust funds and foundations. The Ahmanson company was known for being quiet regarding its operations. Ahmanson's nephew, William H. Ahmanson, succeeded him as head of the then-private corporation, while Richard Deihl continued as CEO of Home Savings and Loan.H.F. Ahmanson & Co., 1993 Annual Report. After Howard Ahmanson's death, the company's reputation for conservative and shrewd management continued, as did its ability to weather downswings in the economy. The Tax Reform Act of 1969, which called for a reduction of concentrated holdings by foundations, resulted in several stock offerings by H.F. Ahmanson, but the company's financial base was so solid that the sales had minimal effect. A $101 million stock offering in 1972 was a record for the time, yet it only represented 6.4% of the firm's $4.4 billion in assets. Alternate Link via ProQuest. After the Bank Holding Company Act of 1970, H.F. Ahmanson was forced to sell the Ahmanson Bank, which it did in 1976 to private Philippine investors. However, Ahmanson was able to retain its trust operations as a subsidiary, Ahmanson Trust Company. In the 1960s, there was intense competition among savings and loan associations centered around very high interest rates and offers of expensive premium items for customers who opened new accounts. In 1966, legislation ended the so- called \\"rates wars,\\" leaving institutions to rely on advertising to attract new customers. Not surprisingly, the larger institutions with more advertising dollars to spend prospered and the giants, including Home Savings, gained the power to set loan interest rates. 1970s The late 1960s and early 1970s were lean years for the savings and loan industry. A frantic building spree had led to many foreclosures in California and money was tight. Out-of-state money had poured into California because interest rates there were much higher than in the rest of the nation, but as other states began to match California's rates, the money was withdrawn. By the latter part of the 1970s, investors were beginning to put their money in California institutions again, but in general at this time people were spending more and saving less than past generations. Savings and loans began to look for alternative ways to make money, through consumer lending (such as appliance financing) and loans on properties other than single-family homes. Ahmanson had foreseen these difficulties and had been making loans on apartment buildings since 1965 as a cushion against the failing mortgage market. But Ahmanson did not diversify to the point that would cause the failure of many thrift institutions in the years to come‚Äîeven into the 1990s the company still did not make auto or consumer loans, leases, or unsecured commercial loans, which tend to be riskier. Several federal regulations passed during this period proved advantageous to H.F. Ahmanson & Company. A 1968 law ended a nine-year freeze on takeovers by holding companies, and a 1971 rule allowed financial institutions to make loans within 200 miles of each branch office‚Äîwhereas the old rule had restricted lending to within 200 miles of an institution's headquarters only. Spurred by the easing of restrictions, the Home Savings network soon covered the whole state of California, as four offices were acquired in northern California. Ahmanson's insurance operations, the original business of the company, continued to grow, as Stuyvesant Insurance Group was acquired from GAC Corporation in 1974 and Bankers National Life Insurance Company was purchased in 1981. 1980s Having saturated the California savings and loan market, Ahmanson began to merge out-of-state institutions into the Home Savings network under the name Savings of America. In December 1981, three mergers were completed in Florida and Missouri; six more in Texas and Illinois followed in 1982. A New York merger was completed in 1984. Subsequent mergers included institutions in Ohio (1985), Arizona (1987), and Washington (1987). At the end of 1987, Home Savings reported $27 billion in assets. These forays outside California often included expensive, and very successful, direct-mail campaigns. One promotion in Texas reportedly brought in $60 million in one month. But Ahmanson's interstate mergers have also generated some opposition. When Savings of America announced plans to open an office in Berwyn, Illinois, a community known for its proliferation of financial institutions, critics in the industry questioned Ahmanson's motives. An earlier protest to the Federal Home Loan Bank by Illinois officials had been dropped after the company convinced the protesters that Illinois money would not be used for California investments. In any event, as one official said, protests rarely affect regulatory approvals, and the Savings of America branches continue to attract savers by offering interest rates as much as 2% higher than local competitors. Further penetration outside California continued when, in January 1988, Ahmanson acquired the Bowery Savings Bank, an institution established in 1934 in New York City. The 25 Bowery offices continue to operate under their original name. Ahmanson also strengthened its loan operations in the 1980s by opening lending offices under the name of Ahmanson Mortgage Company in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia. Two regional loan service centers, in California and North Carolina, provided support for the offices. Richard H. Deihl became chairman and CEO of H.F. Ahmanson in 1983. A company veteran, he joined Home Savings as a loan agent in 1960 and was elected CEO of the subsidiary in 1967. Under Deihl's leadership, Ahmanson company avoided the high returns from junk bonds during the mid-1980s, preferring to rely on the safer 1 to 1.5 percent earnings garnered from a home loan. It was a prescient decision. From 1988 to 1990, when hundreds of savings and loans throughout the United States were failing because of their involvement with junk bonds, Ahmanson's deposits grew by 75% and its assets increased by more than 65%. The company's net earnings during the same period averaged more than $200 million per year. Part of Deihl's success was due to his strategy of streamlining Ahmanson's operating costs. First, the company moved its headquarters to Irwindale, California to take advantage of more space for less money. Secondly, more than 700 employees were eliminated at staff and administrative levels and, as a result, the company lowered its ratio of general expenses to 1.5% of its average assets, nearly one-half point below the industry ratio for the larger savings and loan institutions. Deihl also insisted on adhering to strict criteria for home loans. The average borrower at Home Savings carried a personal debt of 33% of his total income, almost 3% below the standard set by the Government National Mortgage Association. In 1991, approximately 95% of the company's entire loan portfolio was secured by residential real estate properties. 1990s In light of such favorable numbers, Ahmanson continued to expand by purchasing other savings and loans that were failing. In 1990 and the following year, the company purchased Home Savings Bank of New York and also acquired numerous branch offices from Coast Savings' San Diego operation. In 1992, Ahmanson acquired County Bank of Santa Barbara and also changed the names of its savings and loan operations in New York and Connecticut to Home Savings of America. In 1993, the company purchased 24 branch offices from HomeFed Bank. In July, 1994, Home Savings of America purchased Fidelity Federal Bank, Long Beach Bank and Hawthorne Savings and Loan Association, with a total of 21 branches in Southern California with deposits totaling $1.1 billion. In addition, Home Saving of America purchased five branches of Guardian Federal Savings Association of Huntington Beach and four branches of Northeast Savings in San Diego from the Resolution Trust Corp (RTC) in the same month. Two months later in September 1994, Home Savings of America purchased 23 branches of Western Federal Savings Bank from the RTC. Yet even with this expansion Ahmanson felt the effects of California's recession during the early 1990s. In 1992, earnings fell to $156 million, partially due to falling property values in the state which led to a substantial increase in non-performing assets. During the same year, 61% of its mortgage business resulted from refinancings. Prior to 1998 the principal Subsidiaries were Home Savings of America; Savings of America; Ahmanson Mortgage Company; Ahmanson Marketing, Inc.; Griffin Financial Services. In 1998, Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchased HF Ahmanson and its Home Savings unit for $10 billion. As a result of this takeover and those of American Savings and Great Western Financial, Washington Mutual became California‚Äôs second largest bank. At the time, HF Ahmanson had $55 billion in assets. The acquisition also gave Washington Mutual control over a part of the Ahmanson Ranch, a hotly disputed undeveloped area northwest of Los Angeles. After initial considerations of developing a new city on the large space, WaMu eventually sold off their share, now known as the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve. With the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008, JPMorgan Chase has become the successor to H. F. Ahmanson and Co. Home Savings =Expansion in California= In January 1991, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of 19 San Diego-area branch offices of the Los Angeles-based Coast Federal Bank for $20 million in cash. The acquisition was completed in May 1991. Five of the acquired branch offices were closed and consolidated into nearby Home Savings offices. In March 1992, Home Savings announced the acquisition of 10 branch offices of the failed Santa Barbara-based County Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for an undisclosed amount. In August 1992, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of 8 Central Valley-area branch offices of the Coast Federal Bank for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition was completed in November 1992. In December 1993, Home Savings announced the acquisition of 8 Inland Empire-area branch offices of the failed San Diego-based HomeFed Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for an undisclosed amount. In March 1994, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of the four California branch offices of the Connecticut-based Northeast Savings for an undisclosed amount. Three of the offices were closed and the deposits from those offices were transferred to nearby Home Savings offices. The acquisition was completed in July 1994. In July 1994, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of two branch offices and the deposits of the remaining four branch office of the Orange- based Long Beach Bank for $12.5 million in cash. The acquisition was completed in October 1994. After the sale, Long Beach Bank converted from a savings bank to a mortgage banking company that specialized in subprime mortgages and changed the name of the company to Long Beach Mortgage Company. Long Beach Mortgage was later acquired by Washington Mutual in 1999. During the same month, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of the deposits of nine branch offices of the troubled Glendale-based Fidelity Federal Bank for an undisclosed amount and six branch offices of the Hawthorne Savings & Loan for an undisclosed amount in an unrelated sale. The Fidelity transaction was completed in August. Home Savings also acquired five branches of the Huntington Beach-based Guardian Federal Savings Association from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $1.8 million. Link via ProQuest. In September 1994, Home Savings announced the acquisition of 23 branch offices of the failed Marina del Rey-based Western Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $87.2 million. In February 1995, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of 52 Southern California branches of Household Bank from Household International for $53 million in cash. Home Savings had planned to close 20 branches that were in close proximity to existing Home Savings offices. The acquisition was completed in June 1995. In March 1996, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of 61 First Interstate Bancorp branch offices for about $200 million that Wells Fargo was required to sell by the U.S. Department of Justice before Wells Fargo could acquire First Interstate. Alternate Link via ProQuest. As a result of close proximity to an existing Home Savings branch office, the first 14 out of a possible 27 First Interstate Bank branches were announced in June to be closed. In October 1997, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Coast Savings Financial, Inc., with its Coast Federal Bank subsidiary for $900 million in stock. Alternate Link via ProQuest. At the time of the announcement, Coast had 90 branch offices in California while Home had 370 branch offices in California, Texas, and Florida. The acquisition was completed in February 1998. After closing 52 redundant branch offices in California and selling off the remaining branch offices in Florida in an unrelated sale, Home Savings had approximately 375 branch offices remaining in California and Texas by mid-1998. The merger of Coast with Home Savings (and not to mention the subsequent acquisition of Home by Washington Mutual that occurred just a few months later) did not occur without problems for customers. One customer discovered that records for her two adjustable-rate mortgages could not be located for an entire month. A Home Savings customer discovered that the bank lost his safety deposit box, which contained irreplaceable family heirlooms, during the branch office consolidations. Other customers complained about long lines and erosion of the quality of customer service as a result of branch consolidations. =Expansion in Florida= In February 1997, H. F. Ahmanson announced the pending sale of 12 branch offices in Florida to the Birmingham, Alabama-based SouthTrust for an undisclosed amount. At time of the announcement, Home Savings had 39 branch offices in Florida. In December 1997, H. F. Ahmanson announced the pending sale of the remaining 27 branch offices in Florida to SouthTrust for $300 million in cash. =Expansion in New York= In August 1984, Home Savings entered the state of New York by announcing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation- assisted acquisition of the troubled Cedarhurst-based Century Federal Savings and Loan Association. At the time of the acquisition, Century Federal Savings had 16 branches on Long Island. In October 1987, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of the troubled New York City-based Bowery Savings Bank with its 25 New York City branches for $200 million in cash. The acquisition was completed in February 1988 and initially did not merger Bowery into its existing Savings of America's New York operations and kept it as a separate business entity. In April 1990, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of the Bayside-based Home Savings Bank of New York with its 13 branch offices for $300 million in stock. At time of the announcement, Home had 26 branch offices operating as Bowery Savings Bank in the New York City metropolitan area and 18 branch offices in Long Island and New York City operating as Savings of America. The acquisition was completed in November 1990. In April 1992, Home Savings announced that they were changing the names of all of its branch offices to the Home Savings of America name. Previous to that announcement, Home Savings was doing business in the state of New York under the names of Bowery Savings Bank, Home Savings Bank, and Savings of America. In May 1993, Home Savings announced the pending acquisition of 10 branch offices of the Syosset-based Long Island Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount. In May 1995, Home Savings announced the pending sale of its entire New York state system of 60 branch offices to the New York City-based GreenPoint Financial Corporation for $660 million, a price 1.5 times what some analysts had expected the system to fetch. At the time of the sale, Home Savings had branch offices in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County just prior to leaving the state. =Expansion in Arizona= In April 1987, Home Savings entered Arizona by announcing the pending acquisition of the one- office Tucson-based Tucson Savings & Loan Association for an undisclosed amount of Ahmanson stock. In August 1996, Home Savings decided to leave the state of Arizona by announcing the pending sale of all 4 branch offices in Arizona to the First National Bank of Arizona, then a unit of Bancorp Hawaii for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition was completed in March 1997.

Its purpose is \\"to advance, elevate, and preserve magic as a performing art, to promote harmonious fellowship throughout the world of magic, and to maintain and improve ethical standards in the field of magic.\\" To promote these endeavors the S.A.M. presents awards and fellowships in recognition of outstanding achievement in the Art of Magic. Membership in the S.A.M. is open to professional magicians, amateur magicians, youth magicians, magic collectors, magic historians, magic inventors, magic manufacturers and magic dealers. Over 30,000 people worldwide have been members, and currently the S.A.M. has 5,000 members worldwide. The current National President of the S.A.M. is Dr. Joel Zaritsky. History The Society grew under Harry Houdini's leadership. He is pictured here in 1920 in the middle of his tenure. Founded on May 10, 1902 in the back room of Martinka's magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as National President from 1917‚Äì1926. Houdini sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, Houdini would give a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, making speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense. For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini, at his own expense, had been recruiting local magic clubs to join the SAM in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization. Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, Houdini persuaded magicians to join. The Buffalo club joined as the first branch (later, an assembly) of the Society. Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold. By the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies. He had created the richest and longest surviving organization of magicians in the world. The SAM now embraces over 5,000 members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July, 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year. He also was President of the Magicians' Club of London. Society of American Magicians Hall of Fame and Magic Museum, Los Angeles closed temporarily due to fire, contamination, and resultant litigation. After its disastrous fire, the museum's artifacts went on exhibit at the Whittier Museum for six months beginning in September 2012. The organization pays tribute to Harry Houdini, with a broken wand ceremony on the anniversary of his death (by the Jewish calendar) at his grave in Machpelah Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens, New York City. The Society of Young Magicians The Society of Young Magicians (SYM) is an organization devoted to assisting magicians, age seven through seventeen years. The Society of Young Magicians has clubs, known as \\"assemblies\\" located throughout the world; these assemblies are commonly jointly associated with an adult SAM assembly. When a member turns 18, they have the option to graduate to full membership in the Society of American Magicians. The purpose of the Society of Young Magicians is to promote interest in magic as a hobby that develops skill and self-confidence, the ability to speak in public, discipline that comes from learning, practicing and performing magic and a sense of service to others through helping others learn magic and by performing magic at charitable events. The Society of Young Magicians has nearly 100 local chapters, or assemblies, around the world. Adult members of the Society of American Magicians supervise and instruct members of the SYM. Dan Rodriguez is the SYM National Director. SYM's principal means of communication among its members is its e-zine, \\"The Magic SYMbol.\\" Conventions The S.A.M. national convention is held annually, usually over the Fourth of July weekend.

(Former Liang being a state that transitioned from a Jin Dynasty governorship to an independent or semi-independent state that vacillated between being a Jin vassal and being a vassal of the stronger state controlling the Shaanxi region - Han Zhao, in Zhang Mao's case - it is difficult to define a single founding date or founder for Former Liang; but Zhang's general pardon of the people in his domain when he became ruler was considered by many historians as the sign of effective independence from Jin.) During the brief reign of his grandnephew Zhang Zuo, he was honored as Prince Cheng of Liang (Ê∂ºÊàêÁéã). Early career Zhang Mao first appeared in history in 308 when his father, Zhang Gui (ÂºµËªå), the first Zhang Duke of Xiping and governor of Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, modern central and western Gansu), suffered a stroke and was unable to speak, and therefore had Zhang Mao act as governor during his illness. When the unrelated Zhang Yue (ÂºµË∂ä) and Cao Que (ÊõπÊÄØ) tried to take advantage of Zhang Gui's illness to have him replaced, the Zhangs resisted and convinced the powerful Sima Mo (Âè∏È¶¨Ê®°) the Prince of Nanyang that Zhang Gui should remain governor. At this time, Zhang Gui's oldest son and Zhang Mao's older brother Zhang Shi (ÂºµÂØî), who had previously been at Chang'an, returned to Liang Province and defeated and killed Cao, reaffirming the Zhangs' rule over the province. During the subsequent governorship of Zhang Shi, Zhang Mao was one of his trusted generals. In 320, the magician Liu Hong (ÂäâÂºò), who had spread rumors that the gods wished for him to be the ruler of Liang Province, convinced two of Zhang Shi's guards Yan She (ÈñªÊ∂â) and Zhao Ang (Ë∂ôÂç¨) to assassinate Zhang Shi. Zhang Mao had Liu Hong arrested and executed by drawing and quartering. Because Zhang Shi's son Zhang Jun was still young (13 at the time), Zhang Shi's subordinates requested that Zhang Mao take over as governor and the Duke of Xiping, and he did so. He also issued a general pardon for the people in his domain - and this act is the main reason why his rule is commonly considered to mark the independence of Former Liang. As ruler Zhang Mao initially continued to claim to be a Jin vassal, as a governor and a duke. He appointed Zhang Jun, his nephew, as his heir. (Historical accounts are not clear whether Zhang Mao had sons of his own.) In 321, he started the construction of an impressive tower known as Lingjun Tower (ÈùàÈàûÂè∞), but after Yan Zeng (ÈñªÊõæ) persuaded him that it was too costly and that Zhang Gui would have disapproved, he stopped the construction. In 322, Zhang Mao had his general Han Pu (ÈüìÁíû) seize the Longxi (Èö¥Ë•ø) and Nan'an (ÂçóÂÆâ, together roughly modern Dingxi, Gansu) Commanderies - which appeared to be then under nominal Han Zhao control, while Han Zhao forces were battling the rebel Chen An (Èô≥ÂÆâ), extending his domain east of the Yellow River. However, in 323, after the Han Zhao emperor Liu Yao defeated Chen An, he continued on and reached the Yellow River, claiming to be ready to cross it. Zhang went into a battle posture, but negotiated peace, agreeing to submit to Han Zhao authority and offering tributes of horses, livestock, and jewels. Liu Yao created him the Prince of Liang and granted him the nine bestowments. Subsequently, Zhang Mao resumed the construction on Lingjun Tower, stating that its construction was necessary for defensive purposes, and strengthened the defenses of the capital Guzang (ÂßëËáß, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). In summer 324, Zhang Mao grew ill. He told his nephew Zhang Jun to remain faithful to Jin, and also ordered that he not be buried as a prince, since his princely title was not granted by the Jin emperor. He died soon thereafter. Era name Most historical sources indicate that Zhang Mao, like his brother Zhang Shi, continued to use Emperor Min of Jin's era name Jianxing (both to show continued allegiance to Jin and to distance himself from Emperor Yuan of Jin and his line) but some sources indicate that he changed era name to Yongguang (Ê∞∏ÂÖâ y«íng guƒÅng 320‚Äì323). A current theory is that his era name was used internally while the Jianxing era name was used when communicating with other states.

As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a homogeneous space and is diffeomorphic to the quotient space N/H, the quotient of a nilpotent Lie group N modulo a closed subgroup H. This notion was introduced by Anatoly Mal'cev in 1951. In the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold. A Riemannian manifold is called a homogeneous nilmanifold if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it. The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson). Nilmanifolds are important geometric objects and often arise as concrete examples with interesting properties; in Riemannian geometry these spaces always have mixed curvature, almost flat spaces arise as quotients of nilmanifolds, and compact nilmanifolds have been used to construct elementary examples of collapse of Riemannian metrics under the Ricci flow.Chow, Bennett; Knopf, Dan, The Ricci flow: an introduction. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 110. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004. xii+325 pp. In addition to their role in geometry, nilmanifolds are increasingly being seen as having a role in arithmetic combinatorics (see Green‚ÄìTao ) and ergodic theory (see, e.g., Host‚ÄìKra).  Compact nilmanifolds  A compact nilmanifold is a nilmanifold which is compact. One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N and a discrete subgroup \\\\Gamma . If the subgroup \\\\Gamma acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on N, then the quotient manifold N/ \\\\Gamma will be a compact nilmanifold. As Mal'cev has shown, every compact nilmanifold is obtained this way.A. I. Mal'cev, On a class of homogeneous spaces, AMS Translation No. 39 (1951). Such a subgroup \\\\Gamma as above is called a lattice in N. It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational structure constants: this is Malcev's criterion. Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also M. S. Raghunathan. A compact Riemannian nilmanifold is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric. These spaces are constructed as follows. Let \\\\Gamma be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N, as above. Endow N with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric. Then the subgroup \\\\Gamma acts by isometries on N via left-multiplication. Thus the quotient \\\\Gamma \\\\backslash N is a compact space locally isometric to N. Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to N / \\\\Gamma . Compact nilmanifolds also arise as principal bundles. For example, consider a 2-step nilpotent Lie group N which admits a lattice (see above). Let Z=[N,N] be the commutator subgroup of N. Denote by p the dimension of Z and by q the codimension of Z; i.e. the dimension of N is p+q. It is known (see Raghunathan) that Z \\\\cap \\\\Gamma is a lattice in Z. Hence, G = Z/(Z \\\\cap \\\\Gamma ) is a p-dimensional compact torus. Since Z is central in N, the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold P = N/ \\\\Gamma with quotient space M=P/G. This base manifold M is a q-dimensional compact torus. It has been shown that every principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see.Palais, R. S.; Stewart, T. E. Torus bundles over a torus. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 1961 26‚Äì29. More generally, a compact nilmanifold is a torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus. As mentioned above, almost flat manifolds are intimately compact nilmanifolds. See that article for more information. Complex nilmanifolds Historically, a complex nilmanifold meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over a cocompact lattice. An example of such a nilmanifold is an Iwasawa manifold. From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one. An almost complex structure on a real Lie algebra g is an endomorphism I:\\\\; g \\\\rightarrow g which squares to ‚àíIdg. This operator is called a complex structure if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{-1}, are subalgebras in g \\\\otimes {\\\\mathbb C}. In this case, I defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold (G,I) is called a complex group manifold. It is easy to see that every connected complex homogeneous manifold equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way. Let G be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A complex nilmanifold is a quotient of a complex group manifold (G,I), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right. Complex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties. In complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a Kodaira surface.Keizo Hasegawa Complex and K√§hler structures on Compact Solvmanifolds, J. Symplectic Geom. Volume 3, Number 4 (2005), 749‚Äì767. Properties Compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never homotopy formal.Keizo Hasegawa, Minimal models of nilmanifolds, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 106 (1989), no. 1, 65‚Äì71. This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot admit a K√§hler structure (see also ). Topologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained as iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by ascending central series.S√∂nke Rollenske, Geometry of nilmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure and deformations in the large, 40 pages, arXiv:0901.3120, Proc. London Math. Soc., 99, 425‚Äì460, 2009  Examples  = Nilpotent Lie groups = From the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold. The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros. For example, the Heisenberg group is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group. This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient. The group \\\\Gamma would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients. The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional. One possible fundamental domain is (isomorphic to) [0,1]3 with the faces identified in a suitable way. This is because an element \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x & z  & 1 & y  & & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\Gamma of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} & \\\\\\\\{z-x \\\\lfloor y \\\\rfloor \\\\\\\\}  & 1 & \\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}  & & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} in the fundamental domain. Here \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor denotes the floor function of x, and \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\\\\\} the fractional part. The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher- order Fourier analysis. = Abelian Lie groups = A simpler example would be any abelian Lie group. This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group. For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers. The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle \\\\R/\\\\Z. Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.  Generalizations  A parallel construction based on solvable Lie groups produces a class of spaces called solvmanifolds. An important example of a solvmanifolds are Inoue surfaces, known in complex geometry.

The sinopia‚Äîin this case, meaning the underpainting‚Äîof a painting of the Madonna and Child by the Master of the Grigg Crucifixion A sinopie for a fresco by Buonamico Buffalmacco (1290-1341), in the Museum of Sinopie in Pisa Sinopia (also known as sinoper, named after the now Turkish city Sinop) is a dark reddish-brown natural earth pigment, whose reddish colour comes from hematite, a dehydrated form of iron oxide. It was widely used in Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages for painting, and during the Renaissance it was often used on the rough initial layer of plaster for the underdrawing for a fresco. The word came to be used both for the pigment and for the preparatory drawing itself, which may be revealed when a fresco is stripped from its wall for transfer. During the Middle Ages sinopia in Latin and Italian came to mean simply a red ochre. It entered the English language as the word sinoper, meaning a red earth colour.Daniel V. Thompson, The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting, (1956)' Dover Publications, New York, p. 98 Sinopia is a colour in various modern colour systems. Sinopia pigment From Ancient times through the Renaissance, the pigment was mined in Cappadocia, and exported to Europe through the port of Sinop, a Greek colony on the Black Sea. The pigment was valued for its quality and the genuine product was marked with a seal to show its authenticity. In the Renaissance \\"sinopia\\" or \\"sinoper\\" meant any of a range of different shades and hues, and the colour had a variety of names; it was sometimes called Venetian red, or Terra di Siena (Sienna earth), or Ocra rosso (red ochre).Cennino Cennini,The Craftsman's Handbook, note by translator, p xiv. The colour shown in the box above is one more recent commercial variety of the colour. The Italian painter and writer Cennino Cennini (c. 1370- c. 1440) described sinopia in his handbook on painting, \\"Il libro dell'arte\\", this way: \\"A natural pigment called sinoper, cinabrese or porphyry is red. This pigment has a lean and dry character. It responds well to milling, as the more it is pulvarised the finer it becomes. It is good for working on panel or on anconas [a type of panel divided into smaller framed compartments], or walls, in fresco and in secco.\\"Lara Broecke, Cennino Cennini, Il libro dell'arte, Archetype 2015, p. 61 Cinabrese and flesh tones Cennino Cennini described a light red colour he called cinabrese, which was apparently a mixture of a light shade of sinopia and lime white; \\"And I do not know\\", Cennini wrote, \\"that they use this pigment outside Florence. And it is absolutely perfect for doing flesh or for making flesh colours for figures on walls. And work in fresco with it. This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John's white, as it is called in Florence; and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime...this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls...\\" Lara Broecke, Cennino Cennini, Il libro dell'arte, Archetype 2015, p. 62 Sinopia as preparatory drawing of frescoes Sinopia was often used in the Renaissance to make the preparatory drawing for frescoes directly onto the wall, on the levelling coat or on the arriccio. These drawings became known simply as sinopie, the plural word in Italian for the pigment.Sinopia. In: Many of these drawings have been discovered and restored, and are on display in the Museum of Sinopie (Museo delle Sinopie) in Pisa, next to the cathedral, baptistry and the leaning tower. Cennino Cennini described in detail the process by which a sinopia was made and used. First, the artist covered a wall with a rough layer of lime plaster. When it dried, he made his first sketch in charcoal, blocking in the figures and scenes. Then he brushed off the plaster, and using a small, pointed brush and ochre pigments \\"as thin as water\\" and without tempera, he painted in the figures in light shades. Then he used sinopia, also without tempera, to mark out the noses, the eyes, the hair, and the accents and outlines of all the figures in their correct proportions. When the underdrawing was finished, the artist then applied a new thin layer of wet plaster, covering just enough area as he could work in one day. Before the plaster could dry, he filled in the colours into the plaster, following the visible lines of the sinopia. To make the faces in the final fresco, Cennini recommended that the artist first paint them with an undercoat of brownish green, called a verdaccio. When that was dry, then he painted the flesh tones, made with ochre, lime white and a light red called cinabrese; then he painted the whites of the eyes and white highlights; then used black for the pupils of the eyes, the nostrils, openings in the ears and lines around the eyes, and then used a fine brush and sinopia to paint the lines under the eyes, around the nose, the eyebrows, the mouth and the shading under the upper lip.Lara Broecke, Cennino Cennini, Il libro dell'arte, Archetype 2015, pp. 101-2 See also *Underpainting *List of colors *List of inorganic pigments Bibliography * Fabrizio F.V.

It travels for through McCurtain County It has one unsigned spur route, SH-98S. SH-98 began as a short spur from US-70 to Wright City in 1953. In 1958, it was extended to its present extent, although the routing north of US-70 differed from that of the present day. By 1982, the highway had taken on its current routing and termini. Route description SH-98 begins at the eastern SH-37 about north of the Red River (the Texas state line) and west of Idabel. The highway eventually heads northwest, but soon swings back around to head northward. The road continues due north on an arrow-straight course through the level terrain of the Whitegrass Flats. SH-98 intersects US-70 between Valliant and Millerton. Highway 98 curves to the northeast north of US-70. It then returns to a due north course, crossing the Little River. About north of US-70, it makes a sharp turn to the east. The highway skirts the north edge of Wright City, and SH-98S (see below) spurs off to serve the center of the town. SH-98 continues eastward, headed toward Glover, until turning northeast to meet SH-3, where it has its northern terminus. History SH-98 first appeared on the 1954 official state highway map, implying that it was commissioned sometime in 1953. Originally, the highway began at US-70 and extended north to Wright City, where it ended; the route was effectively a spur to the town from US-70 and intersected no other highways. The route remained with this extent throughout much of the 1950s. In 1958, the road was extended in both directions‚Äîto the north, it headed due north from Wright City to end at SH-3 several miles further west than its present-day terminus, and to the south, where it followed a short section of SH-70 to link up with its present-day route and ending at its current terminus at SH-37. The route was realigned between Wright City and US-70 in 1960, shifting SH-98 further west to begin its US-70 concurrency in Valliant. SH-98 was returned to a straighter alignment in 1975, eliminating the concurrency with US-70 and bypassing Valliant. The final major change to SH-98 occurred in 1982, when the road north of Wright City was removed from the highway system and SH-98 extended east toward Glover. This set the road at its present-day northern terminus. SH-98S SH-98 has one spur highway, SH-98S. It is a connector highway to Wright City, but is now unsigned. However, as of 2012, it is still an active state highway. SH-98S first appeared on the Oklahoma highway map in its 1965 edition. At this time, the highway was designated SH-198. The highway would retain this designation until 1985, when it was renumbered to SH-98S.

He came to San Diego in Summer of 1850 as part of the First U.S. Artillery (Magruder's Battery), as a non-commissioned officer. Sergeant McCoy and his troops helped protect the countryside during the war. After discharge in 1853, McCoy remained in San Diego. McCoy worked odd jobs, surveying and carrying mail between Yuma and Tucson, Arizona. In 1859 McCoy was elected Assessor of San Diego. He also started raising sheep near Cuyamaca. McCoy was sheriff of San Diego County, California during 1862‚Äì1872. At the time the county stretched to the Colorado River. Charles Kelly described McCoy as \\"a big man over six feet tall who weighed 190 pounds [85 kilograms]. He could speak Spanish fluently. Everybody thought a great deal of him.\\" Ephraim Morse said that during the time \\"there are only two men in San Diego that don't occasionally get drunk and they are James McCoy, the sheriff, and myself.\\" The James McCoy House at Old Town San Diego State Historic Park McCoy married Winifred \\"Winnie\\" Kearney on April 27, 1869. They bought a newly built two-story house in Old Town San Diego. The house was renovated in 1898 to Victorian style. The house was reconstructed in 1999 and is open to the public. It is located across the street from the Old Town Transit Center. McCoy was president of the San Diego's Board of Trustees during 1869‚Äì1871, when San Diego did not have a Mayoral form of government. During 1871‚Äì1874 he served in the California State Senate. While senator he worked on getting a railroad to San Diego (with limited success), mail service, and land cessions to San Diego. In 1871, at the urging of San Diego developers, he quietly introduced a bill in the legislature to permit portions of Balboa Park to be sold to private parties. However, San Diego residents learned of the plan and rallied to preserve the park as a public trust. In 1887, McCoy and others laid out the subdivision of Moreno, east of Mission Bay. Moreno was named for Felipe Morena, a minor character in the novel Ramona. McCoy died in his home in 1895, and his wife died later. They had no children.

Vaughan Williams had completed the first version of the work in April 1904. He subsequently revised the work in 1905 and 1907. It is Vaughan Williams' earliest composition not to be withdrawn. Whilst various 1920 reports indicated that the score was lost at that time, with one saying \\"perhaps irretrievably\\" and another \\"temporarily lost\\", Alain Frogley commented in 1991 that the manuscript score is in the British Library. Described by Vaughan Williams as a \\"symphonic impression\\", it received its premiere under the conductor Thomas Beecham in 1909. The piece is meant to evoke feelings of traversing East Anglia's often bleak Fen landscape, illustrated by the solo opening melody, then wide open spaces as portrayed by sweeping string orchestral textures, with a melodic language strongly reminiscent of English folksong, and a harmonic language closely aligned with that of Frederick Delius in his idyllic idiom. The orchestration was altered in 1935 and perhaps earlier as well. In the Fen Country received its first publication from Oxford University Press, posthumously, in 1969.

The club are currently members of the and play at the Sir Halley Stewart Field. History The club was established in 1921 when Spalding Town (who had played in the Peterborough & District League until then) was reformed.Blakeman, M (2010) The Official History of the Eastern Counties Football League 1935‚Äì2010, Volume II The new club continued to play in the Peterborough & District League, which they won in 1930‚Äì31. They then stepped up to the Northamptonshire League, which became the United Counties League in 1934. After World War II they won the Lincolnshire Senior B Cup in 1950‚Äì51 and the Senior A Cup in 1952‚Äì53. In 1954 they applied to join the Eastern Counties League, but were rejected after a vote. However, the following season they won the UCL for the first time, also winning the League Cup and were accepted into the ECL. In 1960 they switched to the Central Alliance, before joining the Midland League the following season. After finishing bottom in 1967‚Äì68 they returned to the UCL. During this period they twice reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 3‚Äì1 at Durham City in 1957‚Äì58 and 5‚Äì3 at Newport County in 1964‚Äì65. They won the UCL in 1974‚Äì75 and after several successive top-four finishes, rejoined the Midland League in 1978. They finished fourth in 1981‚Äì82, so were placed in the Premier Division of the Northern Counties East League when it was formed by a merger of the Midland League and the Yorkshire League in 1982. They won the first ever NCEL title with a 1‚Äì0 win on the final day of the season. After internal disputes within the NCEL related to the miners' strike, Spalding rejoined the UCL in 1986 and were champions in 1987‚Äì88, resulting in promotion to the Midland Division of the Southern League. After finishing bottom in 1990‚Äì91 they returned to the UCL. After a narrow escape from liquidation in the early 1990s the club won the UCL Cup in 1994‚Äì95 and the Premier Division in 1998‚Äì99. They were promoted back to the Southern League, but again struggled. Despite finishing bottom in 2000‚Äì01 the club avoided relegation as other clubs resigned. However, they finished second from bottom in 2002‚Äì03 and were relegated again. After a fifth UCL title in 2003‚Äì04 they were promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League. They were transferred to the Midland Division of the Southern League in 2006 but moved back to the NPL a year later to join Division One South. In 2009‚Äì10 they finished in the relegation places but avoided demotion due to clubs transferring between leagues. However, they finished bottom of the following season and were relegated back to the UCL. The club started the 2013‚Äì14 season Premier Division season by winning seventeen games in a row, a league record. The run ended on 14 December 2013 when they lost at home to AFC Rushden & Diamonds. The club went on to win the league, earning promotion to First Division South of the Northern Premier League. In their inaugural season back at Step 4 of the non-league pyramid in 2014-15, the Tulips finished 7th, a slump in form toward the end of the season killing off any hopes they might have had of reaching the end-of-season play-offs. Halfway through the 2015-16 campaign, the club parted ways with its manager of four years, Pat Rayment, though his former assistant, Marcus Ebdon, and coach, Danny Hussey, agreed to pick up the reins in a joint-management role. Mixed form throughout the season saw the team finish 11th. Shortly after the final league game of the season it was announced that both Ebdon and Hussey would be standing down. In early May 2016 former Lincoln United manager David Frecklington agreed a three-year contract and will be joined by his former assistant manager Chris Rawlinson. Ground Spalding have played at the Sir Halley Stewart Field since their establishment. It was originally known as the Black Swan Ground, until being renamed after Halley Stewart, a local MP, in 1954. After World War II the club spent a season playing at a temporary ground in nearby Low Fulney. The record attendance of 6,972 was set in 1952 for an FA Cup qualifying match against Peterborough United.

Adaptation  An animated television series based on the comic book was produced by Dong Woo Animation and debuted in Taiwan in 2004. It aired in Japan on TV Tokyo in 2005; and in 2006, it became the first Taiwanese cartoon shown on South Korean television when it premiered on SBS. The staff include animators from Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. Beside borrowing the idea of origami from the comic series, the story and characters of the animation series are greatly altered. Instead of combine with their Genies to become Origami Warriors, the characters simply summon their Genies.

MM Ahmad was also a Pakistani civil servant, and a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Education and early life He was educated first at Government College, Lahore, and later at the University of London and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. He joined the Indian Civil Service - the ICS - in 1939. Following Partition in 1947, he joined the CSP (Civil Service of Pakistan), this was to mark the beginning of an illustrious and distinguished career within the Pakistan Civil Service. Mirza Muzaffar Ahmad was a member of the Ahmadiyya Community. International career in the World Bank and IMF MM Ahmad is notable for his career as the former executive director and Vice President of the World Bank. A few months after the religiously motivated knife attack on MM Ahmad, he left Pakistan for Washington DC. Following retirement from the Civil Service of Pakistan, he joined the World Bank initially as Executive Director for Pakistan and the Middle East and was later elected to become deputy executive secretary of the joint ministerial committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, better known as the Development Committee. He retired from that position in 1984. Significant achievements MM Ahmad‚Äôs biggest contribution was in the signing of the Indus Basin Treaty and the procurement of development assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors for the construction of Mangla and Tarbela Dams as well as a huge irrigation network. At that time he was Federal Finance Secretary. Years later, as Executive Director of the World Bank, he helped in the servicing and rescheduling of these loans after the dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971. MM Ahmad also played a key role in acting as a go between China and the United States, facilitating a meeting between the then U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Chinese Leadership. Pakistani career Most of this contingent of highly able and trained civil servants who opted for service in Pakistan were to play important roles in establishing the state of Pakistan. Most of them went to Karachi, the country‚Äôs first capital. MM Ahmad was first posted in Lahore, the capital of the part of Punjab that was attached to Pakistan. Among the many positions MM Ahmad held in Lahore was that of secretary of finance. Later, he went to Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, where he served in a number of senior positions, including secretary of commerce, secretary of finance, and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. At this juncture in his career, MM was arguably the most powerful civil servant in Pakistan, with supervisory authority over all three ministries. M M Ahmad's contribution to the process of economic development was recognised by President Ayub Khan in a presidential address in 1967, celebrating 20 years of an independent Pakistan. When General Yahya Khan deposed President Ayub Khan and placed Pakistan under martial law, M M Ahmad was appointed adviser to the new president and given the rank of a federal minister. During M M Ahmad's service, Pakistan underwent rapid industrialization and growth. This received acknowledgment both within Pakistan and amongst the international development community. MM's success was attributable to his ability to assemble a highly capable team of economists, planners and engineers such as the late Dr Mahbub ul Haq, Sartaj Aziz and many others. The difficult task of dismantling the One Unit was entrusted to a committee of officials headed by MM Ahmad. MM represented Punjab while Ghulam Ishaq Khan represented the Frontier Province, A.G.N. Kazi, Sindh and Yusuf Achkzai Balochitsn. MM guided the ‚ÄòOne Unit dissolution committee‚Äô, towards resolving all outstanding issues in time set by the Yahya government. The committee‚Äôs plan went into effect on 1 July 1970, when West Pakistan \\"One Unit\\" was dissolved and all power was transferred to the provinces of Balochistan, the North-west Frontier Province, Punjab and Sindh. MM was also entrusted with the delicate task of getting the governments of East and West Pakistan to accept the macroeconomic framework developed by the Planning Commission for the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The plan was to run for the period between 1970 and 1975. Two panels of economists were set up, one chaired by Dr Pervez Hasan, West Pakistan‚Äôs Chief Economist, and the other by Professor Nurul Islam, a Bengali economist, to resolve the differences between the two provinces. Not surprisingly, the two panels arrived at different conclusions. MM Ahmad stepped into the breach to resolve the dispute between the two groups of experts and the two provinces they represented. Hate campaign and attempted murder MM Ahmad faced a hate campaign and knife attack for his faith, he was a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community which is a global deviant movement within Islam. On 15 September 1971 a CDA employee and lift operator named Aslam Qureshi attempted to stab MM Ahmad to death inside the Finance Ministry, inflamed by the conspiracy theories circulated in publications like Chattan. MM Ahmad had been the target of a number of attacks in the right-wing Urdu press on account of his faith and the prominence of his position. Militantly religious forces which had been suppressed in the Ayub Khan era felt emboldened under the subsequent Yahya Khan government which strongly backed them against left-wing and ethnic parties. Many radicalising messages were put out during the campaign for Pakistan's first general election in December 1970 and the subsequent atmosphere of crisis - religious parties were upset about their poor showing, and redoubled attacks on the Ahmadi community which had backed the successful PPP. Aslam Qureshi was subsequently tried and convicted for attempted murder by a military court, but released early by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto as part of his accommodation with Islamist parties in 1973-74. Qureshi's legal defence was provided for free by PML member Raja Zafar ul Haq who organised support along with a number of other Rawalpindi Bar Association members. Aslam Qureshi's temporary disappearance in February 1983 was used by his Khatm-e-Nabuwwat movement to pressure General Zia's government into the passage of Ordinance XX, once again with the support of Raja Zafar ul Haq who was serving at the time as Minister for Religious Affairs.

It was written for a production of Aristophanes' The Wasps at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was Vaughan Williams' first of only three forays into incidental music. A later performance of the work was one of only a small number of performances conducted by Vaughan Williams that was committed to a recording.Alain Frogley: Liner Notes, UPC 094638215721. 2007. It was scored for baritone solo voices, a chorus of tenors and baritones (in two parts each), and orchestra. The complete incidental music is lengthy (about 1 hour and 45 minutes) and is not often performed. Vaughan Williams later arranged parts of the music into an orchestral suite (about 26 minutes), in five parts: # Overture # Entr'acte # March Past of the Kitchen Utensils # Entr'acte # Ballet and Final Tableau. The Overture is quite concise (about 10 minutes) and is a popular independent concert piece today. The main theme is pentatonic. There are close to 30 recordings now available of the overture. The March Past of the Kitchen Utensils is also quite charming and sometimes separately performed. The entire orchestral suite is also sometimes performed and recorded. The year before he wrote The Wasps, Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris studying orchestration with Maurice Ravel. Although The Wasps may reflect something of Ravel, it is quintessential Vaughan Williams. Except for the opening buzzing, the piece has little to do with wasps or with ancient Greece.

Completed in 1877, it was the church's third temple completed, but the first in Utah, following the migration west of members from Nauvoo, Illinois, following the death of the church's founder, Joseph Smith. The building is located in the southwestern Utah city of St. George. It was designed by Truman O. Angell and is more similar in its design to the Nauvoo Temple than to later LDS temples. The St. George Temple is the oldest temple still actively used by the LDS Church. The temple currently has three ordinance rooms and 18 sealing rooms, and a total floor area of . The St. George Utah Temple was the first temple where Saints could receive all temple ordinances for their ancestors.Utt, Emily. \\"Five Things You Should Know about the St. George Utah Temple\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, 2020.

Retrieved on 17 March 2020. Even though the Salt Lake Temple had been announced and commenced years earlier (1847 and 1853), construction on that temple was not completed until 1893. The St. George Temple was built to satisfy the church's immediate need for an appropriate place for temple ceremonies and ordinances. Because of the pressing need, the building's groundbreaking ceremony was held on the day the temple was announced. It was the third to be completed by the church and the first one in Utah. Young chose a plot as the temple site. Builders soon discovered that the chosen site was swampy with numerous underground streams. Young was consulted on moving the site, but he remained firm in the idea that this was the site for the temple. To deal with the swampy site, workers created drains to eliminate as much water as possible. Then they brought lava rock to the site and crushed it into a gravel to create a dry foundation for the temple. This led to a new problem: how to crush the rock. Someone suggested using an old cannon that the city had acquired. The old cannon was made in France and used by Napoleon during his siege on Moscow. During Napoleon‚Äôs hasty retreat, however, the cannon was left behind. It was later dragged to Siberia, then Alaska, and finally ended up at a fort in California. Members of the Mormon Battalion acquired the cannon, had it mounted on wheels, and brought it to Utah. Today, the old cannon is displayed on the St. George temple grounds. After creating a pulley system, the cannon was used as a pile driver to compact the lava rock and earth and create a firm foundation. After stabilizing the foundation, work began on the structure. The walls of the temple were built of the red sandstone common to the area and then plastered for a white finish. Local church members worked for over five and a half years to complete the temple. Historians James Allen and Glen Leonard made note of the dedication shown by the pioneers in Southern Utah. The workers opened new rock quarries, cut, hauled and planed timber, and donated one day in ten as tithing labor. Some members donated half their wages to the temple, while others gave food, clothing and other goods to aid those who were working full- time on the building. Women decorated the hallways with handmade rag carpets and produced fringe for the altars and pulpits from Utah-produced silk. It was originally designed with two large assembly halls like the earlier Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples. The lower Assembly Hall was partitioned with curtains to provide the ordinance rooms for the Endowment Ceremony. At its completion, it contained of lumber, which had been hand-chopped and hauled between . They also used 17,000 tons of volcanic rock and sandstone, hand-cut and hauled by mule teams. In honor of the temple, the church's April 1877 General Conference was held there. The temple dedication ceremony took place on April 6, 1877. \\"Dedicatory Prayer\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, 6 April 1877. Retrieved on 17 March 2020. Young presided and Daniel H. Wells, his second counselor, gave the dedicatory prayer. The St. George Temple was the only temple completed while Young was president. Shortly after the dedication and the conference, Young returned to Salt Lake and died on August 29, 1877, at age 76. In 1938, the lower Assembly Hall was rebuilt with permanent walls dividing it into four ordinance rooms. The four ordinance rooms were later changed into the present three rooms, at the time the endowment ceremony was changed from a live presentation to one presented on film. The cupola was replaced in 1883 after a lightning strike.Scribner, Herb. \\"What will the St. George Utah Temple look like in 2022? Is the St. George Temple closed?

It begins in the west at U.S. Route 75 Alternate in Kiefer and runs east along 151st St. South before ending at US-64 in Bixby. Along the way it crosses US-75 in Glenpool. It has no lettered spur routes. SH-67 was first established in 1936. Throughout much of its early years, the highway's extent was in flux, at various times serving towns such as Mounds, Drumright, Sapulpa, and Coweta. Route description State Highway 67 is split between the counties of Creek and Tulsa County. The first of the route lie in Creek County, while the remainder of the route, , falls within Tulsa County. SH-67 begins at US-75 ALT in downtown Kiefer. The highway heads east from here, crossing into Tulsa County just under two miles east of town. About a mile after crossing the county line, SH-67 has an interchange with US-75, the Okmulgee Bee-Line. The route then proceeds east to Memorial Drive (US-64 in Bixby), where it reaches its eastern terminus. History SH-67 was first commissioned on May 21, 1936, serving in the same capacity‚Äîconnecting US 75 to US 64 south of Tulsa‚Äîas it does now, though with a much different route. The original SH-67 began at US-75 in Mounds (US-75 at the time using the present- day route of US-75 ALT) and continuing east through far southern Tulsa County, reaching US-64 south of Bixby. The first extension to SH-67 occurred just over one month into the highway's life, on June 23, 1936. This extended the designation north along US-75 to Sapulpa. From here, it ran concurrent with US-66 out of town, splitting from US-66 to follow present-day SH-33 (which at this time followed SH-51 en route to downtown Tulsa) and coming to an end in Drumright. The original part of SH-67, from Mounds to Bixby, was removed from the highway on December 31, 1937. SH-67 was re-extended to Bixby on June 7, 1943, following a more northerly route, branching off from US-75 in Kiefer, similar to the present-day one (although the final realignment of this section was not established until 1971). The western part of SH-67, from Drumright to Sapulpa was truncated on May 8, 1951. This, along with the realignment of August 9, 1971, brought about SH-67 as it exists today. The SH-67 designation was assigned to another segment of highway east of the present-day route.

Owned by Whitbread, Brewers Fayre restaurants are known for serving traditional British pub food and for their Sunday Carvery. History The first Brewers Fayre pub opened in 1979 near Preston, and was called The Farmers Arms. In 1995, 50 outlets were added, at a cost of ¬£85 million, taking the total to 280. At this time the Charlie Chalk Fun Factory was added to about thirty pubs. In 1996, 52 were opened, with 17 having a Travel Inn next door; most were built near motorways. In early 1997, Whitbread introduced the Kiln & Kettle chain, which was similar to Brewers Fayre but without the focus on children. Around the same time, 90 more outlets opened. In October 1999, Whitbread formed a pubs and bars division (2,900 outlets) and a restaurants division (1,300 outlets) which included Brewers Fayre, which was headed by Bill Shannon. In September 2001, 34 outlets (five in Scotland) were put up for sale. In 2003, it was announced that 35 outlets per year would be added over the next five years. Disposals and re-branding In the past, there were many stand-alone Brewers Fayre pubs, but in 2006 Whitbread agreed to dispose of the 239 stand-alone Brewers Fayre and Beefeater sites. These had traditionally lower revenues, and, as growth had stalled in them compared to the still-growing Premier Inn sites, they were seen as an obstacle to the company's sales growth. Sites were sold to market rival Mitchells & Butlers, and over the year after they were sold, pubs were re-branded to Harvester, Toby Carvery, and a selection of other brands. A large number of sites became Crown Carveries (formerly Pub & Carvery), and this sparked growth in the brand, which originally consisted of only a small number of pubs throughout the UK. From 2016 Crown Carveries have been re-branded \\"Stonehouse Pizza & Carvery\\" A small number of stand-alone Brewers Fayre sites were retained where there was land on which a Premier Inn could be built, such as The Three Bells near Lymington and The Craigside Inn in Llandudno. In 2008, Whitbread sold a further 44 Brewers Fayre & Beefeater sites, where planning permission for a Premier Inn was not possible (such as The Lauriston Farm in Edinburgh) in exchange for 21 Express by Holiday Inn hotels, which were converted to Premier Inn. Inshes Gate next to the A9 at Inverness Other brands =Brewers Fayre Local= A small number of sites were renamed Brewers Fayre Local. These pubs originally had a different menu but on the inside were designed more or less like a Table Table restaurant. The spin-off brand did not appear to work as planned, and they are now just known as Brewers Fayre and have the same menu. =Brewsters= In 1999, 120 restaurants were re-branded as Brewsters in an endeavor to differentiate a set of more family-oriented pubs from those more suited to adults. Despite the initial similarities to Brewers Fayre, such as the environment and food offerings, Brewsters placed a greater emphasis on entertaining children; pubs had a multi-level play area known as the 'Fun Factory', children's entertainers, and ice-cream machines. The brand's slogan was \\"Fun for kids, relaxing for parents\\". Another 30 outlets were added in the three years that followed. Many of Brewsters sites were Brewers Fayre sites with Charlie Chalk Fun Factories. The brand was often voted \\"The Most Family Friendly Restaurant Chain In The Country\\" by the baby charity Tommy's. In July 2001, the brand launched a national TV campaign called 'Break From The Old Routine', with the Oui 3 song of the same name as the soundtrack. Despite Whitbread's best efforts, in 2004, Brewsters sales began to slow down. As a result, the company integrated the majority of its 149 restaurants back into the original Brewers Fayre brand during 2005, in an effort to reverse the negative trend. The Brewsters brand had been completely phased out by the end of August. The 2004-05 annual report indicated it was beneficial for Brewers Fayre, not only because Brewsters was focused too much on young families and had lost its credibility with adult diners, but also because Brewers Fayre was focusing too much on the adult market and was trying to establish a more family-friendly attitude. Out of the original 149 outlets, all had kept their indoor fun factories, but a small number had these factories reduced in size and were known as Play Zones. =Table Table= In late 2006, a small number of Brewers Fayre restaurants were refurbished, bringing in a more contemporary theme. The first site was Newhouse, in Motherwell (which opened in June 2006 as a pilot). The restaurants were not officially given a brand name. However, some kept the name Brewers Fayre but the logo was black instead of red, while other sites were signed as \\"Contemporary Dining & Drinking\\". In autumn 2007, further Brewers Fayre sites were changed to this new brand and then again in February 2008. On 18 May 2008 Whitbread launched the brand as \\"Table Table\\". About 100 sites were re-branded in total, but new sites opened after 2008 have all been new builds. Brewers Fayre has now stopped refurbishing its sites with this brand. Table had grown to 111 outlets by mid-2012. However, Brewers Fayre has now converted a number of Table Table sites back to Brewers Fayre such as The Phoenix Park in Paisley in Renfrewshire. In 2017, further sites were re- branded into the Beefeater restaurant chain. =Taybarns= Starting in December 2007 with the Swansea Vale Brewers Fayre, six restaurants were converted to the Taybarns format and one was bought from a rival company. This was an all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant. Whitbread announced plans to convert more Brewers Fayre sites to the Taybarns brand during 2009 and 2010 but this never happened, partly due to their high cost. Despite the success of Taybarns, it was announced in March 2016 that all sites would be returned to the Brewers Fayre brand starting with the site near Barnsley (The Wentworth) and the last site to change was South Shields which closed in September 2016. =Brewers Fayre Buffet Place= Although a majority of Brewers Fayre pubs featured hot counters (Buffet Place now \\"our Chef's Counter\\") as part of their restaurants, the sites in Widnes and Barry were named 'Brewers Fayre Buffet Place'. They feature a larger buffet counter with buffets available all the time. Extras such as cakes and salads are also available. The theme of the restaurant is also slightly different stepping away from the pub theme. In spite of this, these restaurants are now just run as normal Brewers Fayre pubs. Honourable Pilot at the A2/A289 junction in Kent =Cookhouse & Pub= Late 2017 has seen Whitbread launch a new brand \\"Cookhouse & Pub.\\" The first site was the former Lakeside in Oldbury which opened on 12 October. The Stonebrook, The Cotton Mill Kilmarnock, Butterley Park Ripley was re-branded in November 2017 and new build sites in 2018 are open in Bridlington and Rhyl. 'Cookhouse and Pub' have a very contemporary theme. More new builds and conversations have taken place during 2019. Rejuvenation After opening The Harbour in Carrickfergus in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, in early 2006, Brewers Fayre opened no pubs for over two years until The Wobbly Wheel near Banbury was rebranded from Millers Kitchen. Despite the previous policy of disposals and rebranding of Brewers Fayres sites, the chain has seen a resurgence in popularity fueled by new menu offers such as two for ¬£9 meal deals in late 2007, along with an option for two desserts for ¬£2 in October 2009, and two starters for ¬£2.50 in 2015. In late 2008 a refurbishment programme was launched. All sites were given a small makeover featuring a new colour scheme, new carpets, and paintings in the restaurants. Some of the first sites to be refurbished were The Meadows near Barnsley and The Oaks at Norwich Airport. On 31 March 2009 the new theme began with a new logo featuring the new slogan \\"Pub Food as it Should Be\\" printed on the menus. Sites continued to be refurbished, with the last site refurbished in 2010. New external signage was given to each pub at this time as well. In December 2009, The Papermill in High Wycombe was refurbished and hot counters were added in the restaurant. To host theme nights on weekdays in addition to the main menu. After a successful trial at this location the programme was rolled out to further Brewers Fayre locations in September 2010 and then again during 2011. In September 2010 theme nights were introduced to all pubs, including those without buffet counters. These included \\"Pie Nights\\" and \\"Fish & Chip Shop Nights\\". This was a more cost-effective solution than conversion to a Taybarns or a Table Table restaurant, formats which currently have higher sales and profits than Brewers Fayre. According to Whitbread, it was \\"benefiting from sales at its Brewers Fayre and Premier Inn chain\\" in a 2011 economy in which \\"domestic price pressures [are] near their highest levels in two decades\\". In January 2011, Brewers Fayre opened its first new-build site in five years, Malt & Myre, at Lomondgate Drive, Dumbarton. The second-ever Brewers Fayre to open in Ireland opened in November 2012 as part of the Premier Inn at Crescent Link on the Waterside in Derry. Donna Deeney, The Belfast Telegraph, 26 November 2012. Ireland's first Brewers Fayre is The Harbour in Carrickfergus. A228 junction 4 of the M20 near Leybourne Lakes Country Park Fun Factories and Play Zones Most Brewers Fayres have some sort of children's play area. A few pubs feature an outdoor children's play area. All sites which were known as Brewsters have a big indoor multi-level soft play area known as the Fun Factory, with the exception of a small number of pubs which cut the size of the fun factories to make way for more dining space and renamed them Play Zones. Brewster the Bear was the firm's own mascot who appeared in the indoor fun factories. Brewers Fayre originally had Charlie Chalk as their mascot, but he was replaced after the take over of Brewsters in 1999. A few Brewers Fayre sites which did not become Brewsters also had Charlie Chalk Fun Factories which kept running until they were eventually sold in 2007. Brewers Fayre specialises in birthday parties for children, allowing private use of the Fun Factory. In 2013, along with a refurbishment in the Brewers Fayre brand launched a new themed children's menu with The Beanos Dennis the Menace as the new mascot. The theme was originally going to be Scooby-Doo. In 2015, all Fun Factories and Play Zones were refurbished and incorporated the Dennis the Menace theme and renamed \\"Play at Brewers Fayre\\".

He is a member of the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE). He always performs in contests wearing a painted mask and once stated, \\"I'd eat anything. One of my goals in life is to eat everything in the world at least once. I'd eat a roll of pennies if I thought I could set a world record. Some day I hope we make contact with beings from other planets. I'd love to eat alien.\\"5 Quick Questions With... Eater X Career The IFOCE's 2004 Rookie of the Year, in the summer of 2005 Janus advanced to the Final Four of the inaugural Alka Seltzer U.S. Open of Competitive Eating, a single-elimination tournament featuring 32 of the world's best eaters. He is the current tiramisu, ramen noodles, and nigiri sushi-eating champion of the world. In 2006, Janus was featured on the show \\"True Life: I'm a Competitive Eater\\" along with then world-champion hot-dog eater Takeru Kobayashi. The show showcased his daily life, including his training for different events. In 2007, Tim was a test subject in a documentary, The Science of Speed Eating from National Geographic. He underwent an upper gastrointestinal series and was shown to have a stomach that expands four times larger than a normal stomach. His digestive rate of the stomach was also slower than a normal human. On July 4, 2007, just before the release of the final Harry Potter book, Janus appeared on-stage at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest with a sign saying \\"Hermione dies\\". Janus would later admit that the stunt led to rules against signage at competitive eating events, and that he suffered a significant amount of personal backlash for the prank. On September 22, Janus ate 10¬æ 18-ounce burritos (made of rice, black beans, pork, cheese and a mild sauce wrapped in a tortilla) in a 12 minutes to win the $3,000 Costa Vida world burrito-eating championship. On November 21, 2007, Janus helped draw attention to the plight of New York City's homeless by consuming a Thanksgiving meal for four, including a 10-pound turkey, four pounds of mashed potatoes, three pounds of cranberry sauce, 2¬Ω pounds of beans, and a pumpkin pie. The IFOCE donated $6,000 to Second Harvest, a hunger-relief organization, to celebrate the accomplishment. Second Harvest estimated that the donation would provide 30,000 meals to area residents. On May 16, 2009, Janus became the third person in the history of the world to eat 50 or more hot dogs and buns in a Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming exactly 50 in his qualifier in Hartford, Connecticut. In the finals on July 4, he ate 53 hot dogs. On July 4, 2010, Eater X placed second at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest by eating 45 hot dogs and losing to Joey Chestnut who ate 54 hot dogs and buns. In an August 24, 2010, episode of Shaq Vs. on ABC, Tim coached a team led by Shaquille O'Neal to victory in a hot dog eating contest against Joey Chestnut. He is the current champion of the Doodle Challenge, a hamburger eating contest in Connecticut. Janus appeared in the music video for the Boston Spaceships song \\"Let it Rest for a Little While\\" from the band's 2009 album \\"Zero to 99\\". On October 13, 2012, Janus tied for second place with Bob Shoudt in the World Poutine Eating Championship, after eating 8.5 lbs of poutine (or 17 boxes) in 10 minutes. Janus announced his retirement from competitive eating on July 3, 2016 via Twitter. He said that \\"I've wondered how long-term stupid competing is for my health. I can't ignore that feeling anymore.\\" On December 7, 2017, it was announced that Janus and Joey Chestnut would be competing on the 30th season of The Amazing Race.

Millionaire at the time had an event called the Million Dollar Tournament of 10 where the ten highest earning contestants from the season's first 45 shows will return for a chance to answer a million dollar question, and Janus qualified as the fifth seed for the Million Dollar Prize.

He had an inkling towards Winston Churchill (which was the correct answer) but decided to walk away because he was not even sure and because of the money at risk. He also won $1600 on the Discovery Channel show Cash Cab with Ben Bailey. Professional burping On June 8, 2012, in New York City, Janus was crowned World Burping Champion by the World Burping Federation after he produced a single, continuous burp lasting 18.1 seconds. On July 19, 2012, Janus appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to burp for William Shatner. Getting drunk on non-alcoholic beer On August 28, 2013, Deadspin released a video of Janus' attempt to become, in his words, \\"the first person in the history of the world to get legally drunk (.08) on\\" non-alcoholic beer. In the video, Janus drinks 28 cans and bottles of various non-alcoholic beers and then blows into a breathalyzer. A .02 reading is recorded, leading Janus to conclude that if he can't get drunk on O'Doul's, nobody can. Acting Often appearing on television to talk about competitive eating, Janus began appearing on television in acting roles too. Although he usually plays himself (notably in a music video for the Boston Spaceships and in commercials for Major League Eating: The Game and ESPN's Sportscenter), in 2016 he appeared on Showtime's Billions playing a hedge fund trader named Jones. In 2016, Janus also appeared on The Eric Andre Show. Weatherman In 2014, Janus began delivering weather reports when visiting local TV stations to promote contests in which he was competing. On February 8 in Orlando, Florida, he provided the weather report on FOX 35's morning news broadcast. On March 28, on a visit to WPMI in Mobile, Alabama, Tim again provided the weather forecast.

Thurston was born in Montpelier, Vermont, the son of Daniel Sylvester Thurston and Ruth (n√©e Mellen). He moved with his parents to Madison, Wisconsin, in 1854 and two years later to Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. He attended the public schools and graduated from Wayland University in Beaver Dam, where he studied law. Thurston was admitted to the bar in 1869 and commenced practice in Omaha, Nebraska. He was a city councilman from 1872 to 1874 and the city attorney of Omaha from 1874 to 1877. Thurston then served in the Nebraska House of Representatives from 1875 to 1877. He married Martha S. Poland (1849‚Äì1898) in 1872. Her father, Col. Luther Poland, was the son of Deacon Luther Poland, a Vermont pioneer. Her uncle, Luke P. Poland, was a United States Senator and Member of Congress for a number of years, and for nearly a quarter of a century was Chief Justice of Vermont. On her mother's side, Poland was of Puritan ancestry, the family name, Bennett, being conspicuous in New England history. Her parents moved to Wisconsin when she was five years old, where she was reared, completing her education at the Wisconsin State University. After her death in 1898, he married Leodora \\"Lola\\" Purman in 1899. He was appointed assistant attorney of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1877 and general solicitor in 1888.

Founded by John Higgins in 1968 as a small communal house ‚Äì House of Miracles ‚Äì in Costa Mesa, California, the movement quickly grew to a very large movement catering mostly to disaffected college-age youth. There were over 100,000 people involved and 175 communal houses established during its lifespan. The notion of \\"being part of Shiloh\\" was not well-defined. Shiloh did not have official membership. The most generous definition of being \\"involved in Shiloh\\" ...in addition to the Staff ( offices. print shop. Land Staff. etc.) and the Teams (who were schooled and sent out to chosen cities to open a Shiloh House) would also include all the individuals who spent the night or days as guests. Shiloh houses operated like hippy-style rescue missions, in the sense that people who needed a place to stay for a couple nights were welcomed; but the guests were not documented; no identification was asked for; their names were not written down. Consequently, it is unclear how the claim of a hundred thousand people \\"involved in Shiloh\\" could be defended.This edit was written by Jacob Wegelin, who lived in the communal Shiloh houses from July 1971 until August 1976, and edited again by Rhonda Gordon who lived in the communal houses from September 1972-July 1976 and then became part of the Shiloh Marrieds Ministry from July 1976 - September 1982. Two years after the movement's founding, Higgins and some of the core members of the movement bought of land near Dexter, Oregon, and built a new headquarters which they called \\"The Land\\". The movement grew quickly until the mid-1970s as growth in the Houses began to slow down. However, in the spring of 1978, some of the board members of Shiloh called for the resignation of the leader of the movement, John Higgins, alleging the improper use (their disagreement with the allocation of) the self-supporting earnings of the movement. Rather than fight the board's recommendations, Higgins quietly stepped down and the movement quickly dissolved. Several individuals remained on the Oregon property as caretakers, but an eventual legal battle with the IRS over the charitable status of incomes earned by members during the movement's existence ultimately led to the complete dissolution and liquidation of the movement and its assets in 1989. While membership in the movement was voluntary, it was also communal and required substantial commitment. To join the movement, members were expected to make a commitment to Jesus Christ and, in return, their needs would be provided for: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. All members worked together for the support of the ministry, so all wages went into the common fund and were distributed throughout the Houses as needs were addressed.

These include post-doctoral fellowships (over 2500 fellowships awarded since 2001), young investigator grants (over 300 group leader grants awarded since 2001) and travel grants. * The FEBS/EMBO Women in Science Award highlights major contributions by female scientists to life sciences research. Winners of the award are inspiring role models for future generations of women in science. The award is a joint initiative of EMBO and the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS). The winner receives 10,000 euro, a bronze statue (by Dutch artist Marloes Eerdenhttp://www.docart.nl/) and the opportunity to give a plenary lecture at the FEBS Congress.  History The European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) was officially launched in July 1964 after a group of European biologists had discussed the idea earlier at a meeting Ravello. In that meeting, the initial goals of EMBO were set, which consisted of creating a central European laboratory for life sciences and increase scientific interactions between researchers in Europe. At the Ravello meeting, Max Perutz was elected as the first EMBO Chairman and John Kendrew as Secretary General. Initially, 140 biologists were elected EMBO members and in 1969, the European Molecular Biology Conference (EMBC) was set up as a political body with 14 countries as initial members. Since 1964, scientists have been elected annually as members of EMBO based on excellence in research. There are currently more than 1800 Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization, 88 of whom have received the Nobel Prize. As of 2018, the EMBC has 30 member states, two associate member states (India, Singapore) and two co-operation partners (Chile (CONICYT), Taiwan (MOST and Academia Sinica)). In 1982, the EMBO Journal was launched, in 1986, the EMBO Gold Medal was established, an annual award for young scientists. The \\"Young Investigator Program\\" which awards grants to young professors was established in 2000 and three additional journals were launched in 2000 (EMBO Reports), 2005 (Molecular Systems Biology) and 2008 (EMBO Molecular Medicine). In 2009, Maria Leptin was appointed fifth Director of EMBO. In 2011, EMBO established the \\"Science Policy Programme\\" which interacts with policy makers and provides analysis of concerns emerging from advances in scientific research. Closely affiliated organisations to EMBO include the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), The Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) which like EMBO, primarily operate in the European Research Area (ERA).

He was a member of the group of German officers who assisted in the direction of the Ottoman Army during World War I. Kress von Kressenstein was part of the military mission of Otto Liman von Sanders to the Ottoman Empire, which arrived shortly before World War I broke out. He was also the main leader for the Ottoman Desert Command Force (DCF). Kress came from a patrician family in Nuremberg. His father, Georg Kress von Kressenstein (1840‚Äì1911), was a high court judge. Kress von Kressenstein joined the Bavarian army as an ensign in the artillery in 1888. World War I =Palestine= Kress joined Djemal Pasha's army in Palestine as a military engineer and was later chief of staff. Djemal Pasha was given the job by the Turkish leader Enver Pasha of capturing or disabling the Suez Canal. This effort is called the First Suez Offensive, and it occurred in January 1915. Kress von Kressenstein was responsible for creating special boats for crossing the canal (pontoons) as well as organizing the crossing of the Sinai desert. While the desert was crossed with little loss of life, the British were aware of their approach and their attack on the Suez came as no surprise to the defenders. The Ottoman forces were repulsed easily and after two days of fighting, they retreated. Kress von Kressenstein's special pontoons were never used. More than a year passed when the Ottomans tried a second attack on the Suez. With Djemal Pasha directing affairs from his base in Damascus, Kress von Kressenstein led a larger Ottoman army across the Sinai desert, again. This attack ran into a strong British defensive fortification at Romani, east of the canal. The Ottoman army prepared a major set-piece assault on Romani, scheduled for 3 August 1916 (see the Battle of Romani for a detailed description). The attack was beaten off and again the Ottomans retreated back to their bases in Palestine. The British responded with an attack of their own. They captured some small Ottoman forts in the Sinai, built a railroad and water pipe across the desert and then launched an assault on the Ottoman fort at Gaza. Kress von Kressenstein was in charge of the Ottoman defences along with General Tala Bey. In the First Battle of Gaza (March 1917), the British were defeated, largely due to their own errors. In the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917, the British were defeated again, the credit for this victory largely going to Kress von Kressenstein. The British removed their unsuccessful generals and replaced them with General Allenby. The Ottomans also replaced their top leadership, bringing in the former Chief of the German General Staff, General von Falkenhayn. Kress von Kressenstein was kept on as commander of the Ottoman 8th Army defending Gaza and he was also awarded Prussia's highest order, the Pour le M√©rite. In November 1917, the British under General Allenby breached the Ottoman defensive positions at the Battle of Beersheba and the Third Battle of Gaza. Kress von Kressenstein was able to withdraw his defeated troops in fairly good order to new defensive positions in the north. =Caucasus= In the middle of 1918, with the Ottoman-German alliance breaking down, Kress von Kressenstein was sent with a small German force to Georgia, that was protected by Germany after its independence. He helped to frustrate the Red Army's invasion of the Georgian region Abkhazia. Later life Kress von Kressenstein retired from the German army in 1929 and died in Munich in 1948. He wrote in several articles about his experiences in Palestine and the Caucasus, and published in 1938 a full book about the war in the Sinai and Palestine. At least two of his articles have been translated to English. 'The Campaign in Palestine from the Enemy's Side', published in the Royal United Services Institute Journal, and his 1936 article about the 'war in the desert'. His memoirs My Mission in Caucasus were published posthumously in 2001 in Tbilisi, Georgia. In Popular Culture He was played by Ralph Cotterill in the film The Lighthorsemen (1987).

It was the first of his symphonies which Vaughan Williams numbered.Kennedy, M. (1964). A Catalogue of the Works of Ralph Vaugham Williams. London: Oxford University Press. . Sir John Barbirolli conducted the premiere of the piece on 2 May 1956, with the Hall√© Orchestra at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. Symphony No. 8 is the shortest of Vaughan Williams's nine symphonies, with a typical performance taking just under a half hour, yet it is remarkably inventive, especially in the composer's experiments in sonority. Not only does he use a much-expanded percussion section, including \\"all the 'phones and 'spiels known to the composer\\" (as well as three tuned gongs, the same as were used in Puccini's Turandot), but the two central movements use only the wind section and string section respectively. Symphony No. 4 is the only other one of his symphonies to end loudly. (The others all have quiet conclusions, often with the Vaughan Williams \\"fingerprint\\" niente.) Scoring The symphony is scored for an orchestra with conventional woodwind, brass, and string sections (enlarged slightly by an extra harp) but an augmented percussion section including: *Woodwinds: 2 flutes (2nd doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (in B), 2 bassoons *Brass: 2 horns (in F), 2 trumpets (in B), 3 trombones *Percussion: timpani, vibraphone, triangle, glockenspiel, side drum, cymbals, tubular bells, tuned gongs, bass drum, xylophone, celesta *Strings: 2 harps, and strings. Structure The work is in four movements: 1\\\\. Fantasia (Variazioni senza tema) (variations without a theme) (in D minor) ‚Äì the composer also referred to this as being \\"seven variations in search of a theme.\\"Holmes, P. (1997). Vaughan Williams (Illustrated Lives of the Great Composers). Omnibus Press. .

Scherzo alla marcia (for wind instruments only) (in C minor) ‚Äì this short, quick march (with trio) is somewhat akin to that of a British military band.

Cavatina (for bowed strings only) (in E minor) ‚Äì This movement, in a five-part rondo form, has a meditative character and includes important solo passages for violin and cello. The main theme bears a clear resemblance, which Vaughan Williams acknowledged, to the \\"Passion\\" chorale (O Sacred Head, Now Wounded) that Bach used several times in the St. Matthew Passion and elsewhere.

Toccata (in D major / D minor) ‚Äì the finale (entitled Toccata to indicate its virtuoso nature) contains much exuberant writing for the percussion section. Harmonically, the movement seems uncertain of whether to be in D minor or D major. The movement ends loudly with a D, in a D Aeolian (natural minor) context. \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\tempo \\"Moderato Maestoso\\" 4 = 144 << { d2\\\\ff b4 }  { r4 a fis } >> fis4. **8 4 fis e  d2(\\\\p 4~  2)  d16 } Performance history The first performance was given by the Hall√© Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester on 2 May 1956.

He composed it from 1956 to 1957 and it was given its premiere performance in London by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent on 2 April 1958, in the composer's eighty-sixth year. It was subsequently performed on 5 August 1958 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Malcolm Sargent at a Promenade Concert. Vaughan Williams died three weeks later, on 26 August, the very day on which the symphony was due to be recorded for the first time, by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. Vaughan Williams's original idea was to create a programmatic symphony based on Thomas Hardy's book Tess of the d'Urbervilles, even though the programmatic elements eventually disappeared as work on the composition progressed. Existing sketches clearly indicate that, in the early stages of composition, certain passages related to specific people and events in the novel: in some of the manuscripts, the first movement is headed \\"Wessex Prelude\\", and the heading \\"Tess\\" appears above sketches for the second movement.\\"Vaughan Williams and Thomas Hardy: 'Tess' and the slow movement of the Ninth Symphony\\" by Alain Frogley (Music and Letters, 1987) The work is in four movements: #Moderato maestoso #Andante sostenuto #Scherzo: Allegro pesante #Finale: Andante tranquillo The opening theme of the slow movement comes from music Vaughan Williams had composed more than fifty years earlier: A Sea Symphony and an even earlier, unpublished tone poem from 1904 called The Solent. \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key d \\\\minor umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\tempo \\"Poco animando\\" 4 = 100 8\\\\p bes 4  8 bes 4 } Instrumentation The orchestra includes: *Woodwinds: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets (in B), bass clarinet (in B), two bassoons, contrabassoon, two alto saxophones (in E), tenor saxophone (in B) *Brass: four horns (in F), two trumpets (in B), flugelhorn (in B), three trombones, tuba *Percussion: timpani, side drum, tenor drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, large gong, tam- tam, deep bells, glockenspiel, xylophone, celesta *Strings: two harps, and strings Vaughan Williams's program note accompanying the premiere performance remarked thus: > The usual symphony orchestra is used, with the addition of three saxophones > and flugelhorn. This beautiful and neglected instrument is not usually > allowed in the select circles of the orchestra and has been banished to the > brass band, where it is allowed to indulge in the bad habit of vibrato to > its heart's content. While in the orchestra it will be obliged to sit up and > play straight. The saxophones, also, are not expected, except one place in > the scherzo, to behave like demented cats, but are allowed to be their own > romantic selves. Very early on in the first movement the three saxophones play a chorale-like passage in chordal harmony, perhaps to emphasise that this will not be the sort of dance band music which the saxophone produces in the scherzo of his Sixth Symphony. { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Moderato maestoso\\" 4 = 108 \\\\partial 4*1 e4--(\\\\p  f2. e4)  r aes2( g4  e f2 aes4~  \\\\times 2/3 { aes g e } aes( b~  \\\\times 2/3 { b\\\\< bes g\\\\~ } \\\\times 2/3 { b\\\\> bes g\\\\\\\\! } } ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key e \\\\minor **4(  2\\\\. **4)  r 2( 4  ** 2 4~  \\\\times 2/3 { **) } ( ~  \\\\times 2/3 \\\\times 2/3 } >> } Critical reception According to Vaughan Williams biographer Michael Kennedy, at its first performances \\"there was no denying the coolness of the critics' reception of the music. Its enigmatic mood puzzled them, and more attention was therefore paid to the use of the flugel horn and to the flippant programme note.\\"Michael Kennedy, The Works of Vaughan Williams, second ed., Oxford University Press, 1964, pp. 342‚Äì43 Critic and composer R. Murray Schafer remarked that the work is notable only \\"because of [Vaughan Williams's] reputation as a symphonist, and because the composition of the 9th shortly before his death prolongs a certain well-known legend\\" and \\"[found] it difficult...to discover much more than a numerical value in the work.\\" He went on to complain about the saxophones and flugelhorn that \\"all this extra color seems to be employed simply in thickening the middle-orchestra texture, the one area of the orchestra which does not need extra support.\\"R. Murray Schafer, Notes, second series, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Dec. 1959), pp. 150‚Äì51 Unenthusiastic early reaction, along with the unusual instrumental requirements, may have kept the symphony from having the kind of sustained performance history that most of the others have enjoyed. The flugelhorn player at the premiere was David Mason, who remarked that all the press coverage was about the flugelhorn, to the detriment of serious discussion of the symphony as a work.\\"David Mason\\" by Anne McAneney in The Brass Herald, p. 38, Issue 18, May‚ÄìJuly 2007, ISSN 1746-1472 The critical reception given to the US premiere of the work under Leopold Stokowski in Carnegie Hall on 25 September 1958 was more favourable. In the New York Times, Harold C. Schoenberg wrote that \\"the symphony is packed with strong personal melody from beginning to end ... A mellow glow suffuses the work, as it does the work of many veteran composers who seem to gaze retrospectively over their careers ... In any case, the Ninth Symphony is a masterpiece.\\" In the Musical Courier, G. Waldrop described it as \\"a work of beauty ... lyricism, sheer tonal beauty and thorough craftsmanship were in evidence throughout.\\" The differences in the initial critical reactions to the music may have been partly due to the performances. In his 1987 biography of Sir Adrian Boult, Michael Kennedy referred to Sargent's as having been \\"an unsatisfactory first performance.\\" Percy Grainger, however, who was in Carnegie Hall for the US premiere, told Ursula Vaughan Williams that Stokowski's performance \\"seemed a perfect one in every way and the exquisite beauty and cosmic quality of this immortal work struck me as being ideally realised.\\"Oliver Daniel: Stokowski ‚Äì A Counterpoint of View ‚Äì 1982). Alain Frogley considers Vaughan Williams's last symphony to be one of his greatest works.Alain Frogley, Vaughan Williams's Ninth Symphony (Studies in Musical Genesis and Structure), Oxford University Press, 2001Journal of the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, No. 39, June 2007. Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley call this symphony \\"the most impressive achievement\\" of Vaughan Williams's final decade and remark that \\"both outer movements employ highly original structures ‚Äì the carefully graded and layered engineering of rhythmic momentum in the first movement is especially striking ‚Äì and the work offers one of Vaughan Williams's most impressive essays in finely balanced tonal and modal ambiguities.\\"\\"Vaughan Williams, Ralph\\", by Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).

EA-6B in foreground carries 3 under-wing jamming pods for transmitting and a single fixed pod on its tail for receiving. The AN/ALQ-99 is an airborne electronic warfare system, found on EA-6B and EA-18G military aircraft. The ALQ-99E version of the system was carried on the EF-111A Raven aircraft as an escort or standoff jammer. Description The ALQ-99 is an airborne integrated jamming system designed and manufactured by EDO Corporation. Receiver equipment and antennas are mounted in a fin-tip pod while jamming transmitters and exciter equipment are located in under-wing pods. The system is capable of intercepting, automatically processing and jamming received radio frequency signals.EDO Corporation EA-6B Page .

EA-6B Prowler . EF-111A Raven in the foreground carrying a fixed tail pod for receiving and a fixed transmitting pod on underside. Note that while the EA-6B carries removable transmitter pods, the EF-111 has the transmitter built into the underside of the aircraft. The AN/ALQ-99 is mounted on the U.S. Navy's and U.S. Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft and U.S. Navy's EA-18G Growler aircraft. It was mounted on U.S. Air Force's EF-111A Raven aircraft before these aircraft were retired from service by May 1998. The U.S. Navy's EA-6B Prowler were Retired from Active service following deployment in 2015.

It uses a ram air turbine to supply its own power. History Tail fin housing assembly for the AN/ALQ-99 equipment, seen during an EF-111A conversion The AN/ALQ-99 has been used during the Vietnam War (1972‚Äì1973), Operation El Dorado Canyon (1986 American raid in Libya), 1991 Gulf War, Operation Northern Watch (1992‚Äì2003), Operation Southern Watch (1997‚Äì2003), 1999 Balkans War, 2003 Second Gulf War, and 2011 Operation Odyssey Dawn. The poor reliability of the ALQ-99 and frequent failures of the Built-In Test (BIT) have caused crew to fly missions with undetected faults; the ALQ-99 also interferes with the aircraft's AESA radar, reduces the top speed of the aircraft and imposes a high workload on the two man crew when employed in the EA-18G Growler.

Its summit is above sea level and is the second highest point of the North Wessex Downs AONB hill range (the adjacent Milk Hill is 295 m high), and of Wiltshire. It is also the third highest point between Bristol and London. On 23 August 2009, the BBC programme Countryfile featured an item on analysis by Ordnance Survey to determine whether Milk or Tan Hill is the highest. It was confirmed that Milk Hill is higher than Tan Hill. Along the north side of Tan Hill runs a section of The Wansdyke, an earthen rampart which runs east to west across much of southern England. Hill figure and stone circle Formerly, Tan Hill had a hill figure of a white horse, sometimes called the Tan Hill Donkey because of its notably large head. Author Kathleen Wiltshire, in her book Wiltshire Folklore, published in 1975, described the figure being still partly visible \\"on Tan Hill, though the legs have become quite overgrown... This pony or donkey is 75 feet from nose to tail, which stretches down much like that of the Uffington horse, and its head is very large.\\" She went on to write that in \\"the 'valley' between Tan Hill and Rybury Camp stands a miniature stone circle of nine upright sarsen stones about four feet in height, in the centre of which lies a prostrate stone, about the length of a man. A pathway leads up to the 'donkey' from the circle.\\" The figure subsequently became known as Mrs Wiltshires Donkey. Whilst Wiltshire placed the hill figure resided on Tan Hill, another, later source described it on a \\"medium steep slope between Tan Hill and Ryebury Camp\\". The white horse was described as \\"overgrown\\" in 1964 \\"and the legs has disappeared\\". In March 2002 local research by wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk confirmed the horse's existence and established the location of the stone circle, whose position had been misleadingly described in Wiltshire's book. The stone circle had been previously noted during an archaeological field investigation in 1973, but was thought likely to be a modern arrangement of field clearance boulders rather than a prehistoric monument. The path to the horse from the circle still existed in 2002, but no trace of the horse remained. However, in November 2004, vegetation and light conditions allowed the horse's shape to be discerned. In folklore, it was said locally that when the horse heard All Cannings' church clock strike midnight it went down to a dewpond above Cannings Cross to drink. One night it was supposedly so thirsty that it drank the pond dry, even though a dewpond is said never to dry up. Views Views are extensive from Tan Hill, ranging from Cheesefoot Head near Winchester to the south-east to, in clear weather, the Black Mountains in Wales to the north-west, making this, alongside neighbouring Milk Hill, one of the most southeasterly points in the UK from which high mountain country can be sighted. Salisbury Plain and, further away, the Mendips and Cotswolds are also clearly visible. According to computer-generated panoramas it should be possible to sight Pen y Fan, highest point of the Brecon Beacons, in exceptionally clear weather.

They were established in 1970 as Woodley Athletic, and played at the Neil Rourke Memorial Stadium. The club's name was changed to Woodley Sports during its time in the Manchester League. In 1992, they became champions of the Manchester League Division One, and were promoted to the Manchester League Premier Division the following year. They became a member of the Northern Premier League Division One in 2004; in 2007, they played in the inaugural season of the Northern Premier League Division One North. The Lambeth Grove Stadium (at which they play) is one of the few football grounds in England to have a synthetic playing surface; because of this, their ties in the FA Cup are switched if they are drawn at home. In the 2011‚Äì12 season they were demoted to the North West Counties Football League Premier Division for ground grading reasons and changed their name to Stockport Sports. On 2 March 2015, the club was expelled from the NWCFL for a breach of numerous league rules. History Woodley Sports won the Manchester League Division One title in 1992. The following year saw Woodley both win the Gilchrist Cup and take the Premier Division Runners-up spot. Work to enclose the ground began in 1996‚Äì97, and Woodley's application to join the North West Counties League was accepted. By this time, the management team of John Imrie and Gary Lowe had been introduced. Both had played at the highest levels for professional and semi-professional clubs such as Manchester City, Crystal Palace, Macclesfield and Runcorn. During the 1997‚Äì98 season Woodley set a North West Counties League record, when Peter Carty scored seven goals in a league game against Blackpool Mechanics. Carty was also Woodley's leading scorer that season, netting 35 goals. Woodley also scored a record 102 league goals that season. During the summer of 1998 Woodley began work on its biggest project to date, the installation of floodlights. The lighted pitch gave the club a boost, enabling it to enter the FA Vase, Cheshire Senior Cup, North Western Trans Floodlit Cup and the FA Cup. The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw the club's first ever FA Cup Match against reigning NCEL champions Ossett Albion, which resulted in a 2‚Äì1 victory for the Steelmen. The continued work of the club was rewarded that season when the Steelmen won the Second Division championship on goal difference from Curzon, winning 12 of their last 13 matches and drawing the other, to take its place in the top flight of the North West Counties League. Woodley Sports logo The 2000‚Äì01 and 2001‚Äì02 seasons saw the club consolidate itself in the top half of the NWCFL First Division, with its reserve team winning a double championship in 2002; it won the Reserve Division title for the second consecutive year and the Reserve Cup. The season finished with work beginning on a new 200-seat stand, which was due to be finished for the 2002‚Äì2003 season. The 2003‚Äì2004 was Woodley's greatest to date. It won the Cheshire FA Senior Cup, beating Witton Albion in the final; unfortunately, that game was better-known for its \\"streaker incident\\", when the opposition captain was sent off for tackling the streaker, than for its being the first time a North West Counties side reached the finals. The FA restructuring of the football pyramid allowed Woodley to gain promotion to the Northern Premier League by finishing fourth in the league. With the Lambeth Grove stadium passed for the Northern Premier League, the Club declared itself a limited company effective 1 August 2004. The 2004‚Äì05 season saw Woodley Sports compete in the NPL Division One; it finished 11th and reached the final of the Chairman's Cup. Off the pitch the club obtained the support of two local businessmen, who have worked with the club on ¬£3.5 million worth of development on the site. Phase one was the installation of a synthetic surface in July 2005, which insured no future postponements and provided an income stream for the club from hiring of the facilities. Future plans included new floodlights, additional seating, covered standing accommodations, new perimeter fencing and new treatment rooms for use by players and spectators. The 2005‚Äì06 season saw Woodley finish in their highest NPL position (finishing fourth, gaining an automatic playoff place), only to lose against Gresley Rovers. During that season, they sold striker Liam Dickinson to Stockport County for ¬£2,000. A youth team was introduced; the previous squad moved up to become the reserve team, competing in the Lancashire Lancit League. 2006‚Äì07 was disappointing by contrast with a 10th-place finish; however, the season was notable for cup successes in major competitions at Conference North, Leigh RMI in the FA Cup and Moor Green in the FA Trophy. Home successes were gained against Marine and Whitby Town. However, they were defeated 8‚Äì7 on a penalty kick in overtime in the League President's Cup semi-final at Premier League side Matlock, despite playing over an hour with 10 men. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, the team finished 13th in the Northern Premier League Division One North. Disappointing news was given to Woodley Sports when the administration of Stockport County was announced. Woodley were owed ¬£150,000 from Stockport County for the sale of Liam Dickinson, and this shortfall put the club's future in doubt. However 18-year-old Anthony Sarcevic was sold to Crewe Alexandra for an undisclosed fee. He came through the ranks of Woodley Sports and manager Trevor MacFarlane gave him the chance of first team football in September. In April 2012 the club announced the appointment of former England international player Peter Withe as manager. In November 2012 Withe tendered his resignation to the board and now continues with various media roles outside of the club. For the 2012‚Äì13 season the club changed its name to Stockport Sports. The 2014‚Äì15 season saw the club breach a series of league rules throughout the campaign, such as failing to fulfill fixtures on three occasions and their failure to notify the league of their home venue for the remainder of their home games. This led to a suspension being placed on the club by the Cheshire FA. In March 2015, the member clubs of the NWCFL voted in favour of expelling the club from the league.

The Air Base branch was constructed in 1943. Excursions were offered for the first time on the SMVRR in November 2006, continuing into 2007. History The SMV was incorporated on July 14, 1911 as the Santa Maria Valley Railway at Los Angeles, California with A. A. Dougherty listed as President. The first of track, from the Southern Pacific connection at Guadalupe to Betteravia Junction, was actually built by the SP in August 1899 to get to a sugar mill. The SP leased the track to the SMV years later. From Betteravia the SMV built to Santa Maria and on to Roadamite. The SMV also had branches running from Stowell to Air Base, Suey to Rosemary Farms and Rex to Gates. By 1925 the railway traffic had steeply declined and the railway went bankrupt. Captain George Allan Hancock , a principal of the Dominion Oil Company, purchased the railroad for $75,000 at a Sheriff's auction. The railroad was then reorganized as the Santa Maria Valley Railroad in 1926. Until 2006, the railroad was owned by Captain G. Allan Hancock's estate. The original line ran for , from Guadalupe to Roadamite. The track from Gates to Roadamite was abandoned in 1950. The last run of No. 21, Captain Hancock's favorite steam locomotive, was in February 1962. Captain Hancock took the throttle one last time. Walt Disney was in the cab with Captain Hancock. Baldwin 21 currently is undergoing restoration in Astoria, Oregon to be returned to excursion service. The Union Sugar Beet plant closed in 1993, ending the beet train era. In 1999 the G. Allan Hancock Estate gained full control of the SMV. The assets of the railroad were sold to Coast Belle Rail Corporation in 2006, ending an 81-year ownership by the Hancock family. Other than 21, three other steam locomotives are in existence. 205 is nearing completion in the return to Service, also in Oregon, owned by George Lavacott. 100 is also in Oregon, but has not yet entered restoration. 1000 resides on Static Display in Griffith Park at Travel Town. =Timeline= *July 14, 1911 Santa Maria Valley Railway organized *August 23, 1911 grading commenced *September 28, 1911 laying rails commenced *March 15, 1912 construction completed *October 7, 1911 first train operated *1926 Santa Maria Valley Railway reorganized as the Santa Maria Valley Railroad *1950 track abandoned between Gates and Roadamite *2006 Purchased by the Coast Belle Rail Corp. from the descendants of G.A.

The party's Chairman is Jypar Jeksheev (Jypar Jekshe), who is also the founder of the movement. The party was founded on June 27, 1993 with Jeksheev as chairman until 2000, when he was succeeded by Edilbek Sarybaev. In 2000 the movement joined with the supporters of the barred Ar-Namys (Dignity) Party of former Prime Minister Felix Kulov to form an electoral alliance to contest the parliamentary elections. The alliance collapsed when the Ar-Namys Party was registered. The party's platform calls for democratic social development and formation of a politically and economically competent personality. In 2004 the movement joined the People's Movement of Kyrgyzstan electoral alliance. Historical background Initially there was an opposition umbrella bloc, called the Kyrgyzstan Democratic Movement (Kyrgyzstan Demokratiyalyk Kyimyly, KDK). It was established on 25‚Äì26 May 1990 as a bloc of several anti-Communist political parties, movements and nongovernment organizations in Kyrgyzstan. The bloc elected five co-chairmen: Dr. Topchubek Turgunally (Turgunaliev), Kazat Akmatov (a Kyrgyz writer, then lawmaker), Jypar Jekshe (one of the leaders of Ashar movement), Tolon Dyikanbaev and Kadyr Matkaziev (leader of the Asaba Party). The draft of the program of the KDK was prepared by Dr. Kamilya Kenenbayeva (Women Pedagogy Institute in Bishkek, now the Pedagogy University named after Ishenally Arabayev), and the draft regulations of the movement was prepared by Dr. Tyntchtykbek Tchoroev (Kyrgyz State University, now the Kyrgyz National University). The movement consisted of democracy- minded intellectuals, workers, and students from ethnic groups (Kyrgyz, Russian, Ukrainian, German, Jew, Uzbek, Dungan, etc.) The movement was dispersed into several political parties after the collapse of the Soviet Union and emergence of the independent Kyrgyz Republic. It took a few years (1991‚Äì1993) and one of its groups emerged as the Party of the Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan (June 1993). References * T. Chorotegin, K.

Life Meskoob was born in the city of Babol in north of Iran. He started reading novels and literature since he just finished the primary school. He then continued his school in Isfahan and then returned to Tehran in 1945 to study law in the University of Tehran. Three years later he graduated from law school and started his activities in leftist political parties. In March 1955 he was jailed and tortured. Two things kept him alive while he was prisoned; his mother and his close friend Morteza Keyvan who was executed. Shahrokh Meskoob was released in May 1957. From 1959 until the 1979 Iranian revolution, he worked for different government sectors. After the revolution, he moved to Europe and spent most of his time with his sister in France.

He wrote some 350 songs over his career and sold as many as 20 million copies of his works. These pieces varied in tone from low comedy to sentimental and pious; his material was sometimes confused with that of Stephen Foster as a result. In his later years, Hays put forth one of the more plausible claims to authorship of the song \\"Dixie\\". In the end, however, no evidence could be produced to back up his pretensions. Biography Hays was born as William Hays in Louisville, Kentucky, which was then a small but rapidly growing city where he would spend most of his life. He published his first poetry in 1856 and 1857 through the paper of his Georgetown, Kentucky, school. Hays eventually received the nickname \\"Shakespeare\\" for his writings, an appellation he made a formal part of his name. Hays finished school and returned to Louisville in 1857. He found employment at D. P. Fauld's music store, where he continued to write music and poetry. He published many of his pieces under pen names, including Syah (\\"Hays\\" spelled backward). He also produced three small collections of poetry. Over his career, Hays is credited with over 350 songs, and he may have sold as many as 20 million copies of his works, making him more prolific than most of his 19th century peers.Abel 47. His songs show a great variety, ranging from austere hymns to base minstrel tunes. In fact, the style of some of his songs was so like that of Stephen Foster that the two men's material was sometimes confused. Hays was married to Rosa Belle McCullough (1847-1935), and the couple had two children, Mattie and Samuel. Hays died in Louisville on July 23, 1907, less than a week after his 70th birthday. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. \\"Dixie\\" claims In his later years, Hays claimed to have written the lyrics to \\"Dixie\\", a song that had enjoyed unprecedented popularity since before the American Civil War and that was by then usually attributed to minstrel show songwriter Dan Emmett. Specifically, Hays said that he had written the song at Faulds in 1858, one year before Emmett and Bryant's Minstrels first performed it. In May 1907, Hays presented his claims to a Southern historical society in Louisville known as the Filson Club. The organization formed a subcommittee and investigated. On June 4, the subcommittee chair announced that he had received word from a man in Texas who claimed to have a copy of Hays's sheet music, published through D. P. Faulds. Nevertheless, the document never materialized. Meanwhile, the 70-year-old Hays grew ill, and his wife took over management of his case. She wrote to Oliver Ditson & Co., a Boston-based publisher, for information on \\"Away Down South in Dixie\\" by Will S. Hays. They responded that they did not have such a song in their catalog. William Shakespeare Hays died in 1907 with no resolution to his claim. However, Hays's claim was not forgotten. In 1908, Thomas J. Firth, a music teacher in Memphis, Tennessee, who had led the 13th Tennessee Volunteers band, contacted D. P. Faulds. The publisher claimed to have printed 50,000 copies of the song a year earlier than Firth, Pond & Co. did so for Emmett. Faulds said that his version was copyrighted and attributed to Hays as \\"Way Down South in Dixie\\". Furthermore, Faulds wrote that only the lyrics had been copyrighted, since the music came from an earlier English song that began \\"If I were a soldier wouldn't I go . . .\\", and which had been subsequently parodied in a children's song. Unfortunately for Firth, all copies had been lost in a store fire.Abel 48. Evidence suggests that Faulds's did publish a song called \\"Away Down South in Dixie\\" with words attributed to \\"Jerry Blossom\\" and music by \\"Dixie Jr.\\", but it was in 1860‚Äîafter Firth, Pond & Co.'s version. In 1917, Thomas J. Firth wrote to Mrs. Hays for a copy of Hays's version of the song, but she had none to show him. In 1916, Edward Le Roy Rice, journalist for The New York Clipper, wrote to Mrs. Hays and explained that he was researching a book on \\"Dixie\\" and wished to settle the authorship argument once and for all. Still, Mrs. Hays was unable to provide him with any evidence to support her husband in the dispute. In 1937, Hays's daughter made one final attempt to support her father as the author of \\"Dixie\\". She wrote to The Etude that her father had written \\"Dixie\\" for the Buckner Guards \\"when they were called south during the Civil War\\". The editor, James Coke, asked for evidence, but she could provide none. To this day: there remains, as yet, no known evidence to support Hays' claim that he did indeed write \\"Dixie\\".

Robodome History Project Galileo started in December 2000, as a result of a telescope being donated to a Bristol school, with the overall aim of making the system available for other schools in the area to use. The system became operational in July 2005, and achieved full on-line capability by the autumn of 2008, running until the main project co-ordinator left teaching. Aims Project Galileo aims to provide a curriculum resource for Science and Technology at Key Stages 3 & 4 and AS/A2 levels, including ICT & Design & Technology courses at post-16 level, to inspire teenagers to \\"learn the art as well as science of research and research teams, how scientific research is practiced, how physical ideas become mainstream, how collaboration between scientific disciplines fosters greater understanding, and to encourage links and collaboration between schools of different age-ranges and traditions in the city of Bristol.\\" (Project FAQ) The project focuses on the issues surrounding the maintenance and successful operation of a remote-controlled observatory. It is built around a remote-controlled telescope with a 1.3 metre dome and CCD camera located in Bristol, which enables imaging and searches of comets, asteroids, supernovae, deep-sky and planetary objects. How it works Schools will be able to register via the main Project Galileo website (see #External links below), and then login to the telescope to order images, much in the same way as is done with other online school observatories. One important feature of the software being developed for the project is that it comes under the GPL, so other schools or institutions who want to develop similar systems will be able to modify the code rather than having to spend vital educational budgets for proprietary software. The code being used for the project can be found via the #External links. Other institutions using similar code are the DRACO project at Durham University and R.O.Y. (the Robotic Observatory at York), based at York University. Project Galileo uses code developed by Dr John Lucey at Durham University, and ROY is in the process of migrating from Windows- based software to code used by Project Galileo. All the code being developed is the work of volunteer efforts - if you wish to contribute, please visit the external links section below for more details. Here is a simplified diagram of how the system works: none In reality, the backend database and control software consist of several systems, including an image processing cluster which is responsible for creating the final processed versions of the raw images that are taken by the telescope.

Infection Alabama is a fairly standard file infector outside its odd behaviour of deciding what files to infect. When an infected file is executed, Alabama goes memory resident. Whenever a .EXE file is executed from this point on, Alabama will search out for another file to infect. This is probably intended to place blame on the file that is being executed instead of the virus itself. Files infected by Alabama increase in size by 1,560 bytes. Symptoms A number of symptoms are associated with Alabama: *EXE files will increase by 1,560 bytes in size upon infection. *On Fridays, Alabama will begin to modify the File Allocation Table. As a result, when a file is executed, another may appear in its place. This is potentially dangerous. For more information, see the payload section. *One hour after an infected program is run, Alabama will bring up a flashing box with the text \\"SOFTWARE COPIES PROHIBITED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW..............Box 1055 Tuscambia ALABAMA USA.\\" The third symptom is by far the clearest indication of an Alabama infection. It is unknown what the PO Box address in the virus refers to. However, the implication of the message is that Alabama was released in an attempt to curb software piracy. Similar motivations led to the creation of the first known PC virus, Brain. This message also suggests that the PO Box may very well not belong to the author: the author clearly meant Tuscumbia, Alabama, as Tuscambia is not a city. This supports the theory that the virus originated in Israel. Payload On Fridays, Alabama will begin to modify the File Allocation Table in an odd way. Instead of searching for a file to infect, Alabama searches for a file to cross-reference. The virus modifies the FAT entry so that when the user executes one file, another will appear. For instance, on a machine where Alabama is resident, executing PROGRAM1.EXE on a Friday may cause the virus to search for another program and find PROGRAM2.EXE. Alabama will then modify the FAT so that whenever PROGRAM1.EXE is executed, PROGRAM2.EXE displays instead. This certainly can result in confusion, and may result in programs being lost or incorrectly deleted. Prevalence The WildList , an organisation tracking computer viruses, never reported Alabama as being in the field. It was isolated spreading in Israel, but this may have been a limited local outbreak. Since the advent of Windows, even successful DOS viruses have become increasingly rare. As such, Alabama can be considered obsolete. Variants There is one known variant of Alabama. Alabama.B was distributed as a modified SDIR.COM. SDIR.COM was a program created to replace the DOS DIR command. Like the original Alabama, the \\"B\\" variant does not infect .COM files. The modified SDIR.COM is simply used as a dropper.

He was the great-grandfather of the Jin Dynasty poet Tao Yuanming.  Early career  Tao Kan was born under the rule of Eastern Wu, and his father was an Eastern Wu general. Early in his career, he was a low-level county official, but subsequently on recommendation of the commandery governor Zhang Kui (), he was sent to the Jin prime minister Zhang Hua for commission; however, Zhang Hua, who did not favor people from former Eastern Wu lands, did not give him a commission, and he ended up serving on staff of the general Sun Xiu (Â≠´ÁßÄ, not to be confused with the Eastern Wu emperor), a member of the Eastern Wu imperial household. Later, Tao served on the staff of the famed Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan) governor Liu Hong (). Liu once personally told him, \\"When I was serving on General Yang Hu's staff, he told me that I would one day have his position. Now, I tell you that you will one day have my position.\\" Tao later played a large role in Liu's suppression of the rebel Chen Min (). He later served successively as several commanderies' governor, and later served under the general Wang Dun, participating in Wang's campaign against various agrarian rebels, including the powerful Du Tao (). For his accomplishments, Wang commissioned Tao as the governor of Jing Province, fulfilling Liu's prior words. However, Wang soon became apprehensive about Tao's abilities. In 315, he suddenly detained Tao and ordered him to be the governor of Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, modern Guangdong) -- considered to be a demotion and an exile. He even considered executing Tao, but fearful that killing Tao would lead to reactions from the general Zhou Fang (), whose daughter was Tao's daughter-in-law, he allowed Tao to report to Guang Province, which had been in control of the semi-rebel Wang Ji (). Upon arrival in Guang Province, Tao defeated Wang easily and pacified the province. As the provincial affairs did not require him to work all day, Tao developed the exercise habit of moving a hundred bricks a day from his study to his courtyard, and then from the courtyard back to the study, reasoning that he needed to continue to exercise himself for future campaigns to recover central China. He was therefore often cited in Chinese history as an example of the importance of physical exercise.  Later career  When Wang Dun rebelled against Emperor Yuan in 322, Emperor Yuan commissioned Tao to be the governor of Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi) with intent that Tao participate in attacking Wang's rear. However, Tao sent only a small force to assist Sima Cheng () the governor of Xiang Province (ÊπòÂ∑û, modern Hunan), who was loyal to Emperor Yuan, and Tao's force was insufficient to prevent Sima Cheng from being defeated and killed by Wang. After Wang was successful in capturing the capital Jiankang and forcing Emperor Yuan to submit to his will, he kept Tao at Guang Province. Subsequently, after Wang died during his campaign to overthrow Emperor Ming in 324, Emperor Ming made Tao the governor of Jing Province and military commander of the western provinces. He was effective in that role‚Äîand the military improvements he made later helped to pave the way for Huan Wen's later campaign to conquer Cheng Han in 347. However, Tao became resentful when Emperor Ming died in 325 and failed to list him among the officials who were promoted or honored‚Äîleading him to suspect that Emperor Ming's brother-in-law, the regent Yu Liang, had erased his name. As a result, Yu became apprehensive of Tao, and subsequently, when Su Jun rebelled in 327 and attacked Jiankang, he ordered Wen Jiao the governor of Jiang Province not to come to Jiankang's aid but instead defend against a possible Tao attack, and this contributed to Jiankang's fall to Su in 328. After Jiankang fell, Yu fled to Wen's domain, and they considered how they could defeat Su. Wen's cousin Wen Chong () suggested that they offer the title of the supreme commander to Tao, and they did so. However, Tao was still resentful of Yu and therefore initially refused. Eventually, however, after his anger was over, he accepted, and he, Wen, and Yu combined their forces and headed east to Jiankang. In winter 328, during a battle with Su, Su was killed, and they subsequently defeated the remnants of Su's army in 329. For his contributions, Tao was created the Duke of Changsha. When he later suppressed the rebellion of Guo Mo () in 330, he was given the military command over eight provinces‚Äîan extreme authority not even matched by Wang Dun. As he grew ill in 334, he resigned and tried to retire to his dukedom of Changsha, but died on the way.

Bryn Mawr Film Institute is a non-profit, community-supported movie theater located in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, a town on Philadelphia's Main Line. It re-opened in March 2005, with Ben Kingsley present, and currently has over 9,100 supporting members. BMFI shows a wide range of films, including foreign, independent and art house films. Film education is an integral part of the theater's mission; BMFI works with area schools and also offers film studies courses for adults. BMFI also offers film discussions and open screen Mondays featuring films from area filmmakers, and also offers community partnerships that provide benefits to participating organizations.  History of the theater  Entrance The building began life as the Seville Theater. It was designed by Philadelphia architect William Harold Lee, a designer of over 200 theaters. The Seville was built in 1926, one of six theaters built along the Main Line in the 1920s. Originally a one-screen theater, it was later split into two during the 1980s. In 2002, after the national chain that owned the Seville Theater declared bankruptcy, Juliet Goodfriend, who became the founding president and executive director, led the effort to save the theater. After many fundraising events and zoning appeals, the theater was purchased in 2004 by the Bryn Mawr Film Institute (the name of the group founded in 2002 by academic, business and civic leaders from the area). Goals  Atrium A three-phase restoration of the theater began soon after BMFI purchased it. Phase 1 included refurbishing the lobby, installing new production and sound equipment, modernizing the electrical and heating systems and building a new caf√©. Phase 1 was completed in March 2006 with the installation of the new marquee. Approximately $9 million was raised to complete the theater's transformation. During Phase II, the Institute finished the restoration of the skylit atrium to its original state, at a cost of $2 million, in March 2009. Other upgrades include classroom space and an elevator. Phase III introduced two additional state-of- the art theaters, and the two previously existing theaters were also renovated. On April 27, 2014, the completion of the 10 million dollar renovation project was celebrated. Leadership  BMFI was led by its founder and president, Juliet Goodfriend, until April 2017, at which point she stepped down and assumed the role of Chair of the Board. Samuel Scott, formerly the Chairman, became Executive Director, and at present is still in that role as well as being CEO.

History The fourth Tokugawa sh≈çgun was the first to hold this ceremony 300 years ago. On the eve of war, he gathered his daimy≈ç in his castle to break open a sake cask. Upon achieving victory, a new tradition was born. Ceremony The ceremony nowadays is also performed at weddings, sporting events, housewarmings, opening days at new companies, and other significant events worthy of being celebrated. In Japan, mochi was traditionally made at home, but most families today buy it ready- made. Over the holidays, a pair of round mochi (kagami mochi) the size of small plates ‚Äì one a little larger than the other ‚Äì is stacked on a stand and placed in a household Shinto or Buddhist altar or tokonoma as an offering to the deities that visit on New Year's. The ornamental mochi is removed on January 11 and broken into smaller pieces before being eaten. By this time, the kagami mochi is usually quite brittle, and cracks appear on the surface. The mochi is not cut with a knife, since cutting has negative connotations (cutting off ties) and is instead broken with one's hands or a hammer. Many Japanese martial arts dojo use the Kagami Biraki ceremony to signify their first practice of the New Year. The sake version of the ceremony (based on the original practice) involves presenting a wooden barrel of iwai-zake (\\"celebration sake\\") to the celebrants at the beginning of the event. The round, wooden lid of this barrel (representing harmony) is then broken open with wooden mallets handled by VIPs (thus the event breaking open good fortune) and the contents then freely distributed among the participants.

Keppel grew up at Duntreath Castle, the family seat of the Edmonstone baronets in Scotland. She was the youngest child of Mary Elizabeth, n√©e Parsons and Sir William Edmonstone, 4th Baronet. In 1891, she married The Honourable George Keppel and they had two daughters. She became one of the best society hostesses of the Edwardian era. Her beauty, charm and discretion impressed London society and brought her to the attention of the future King Edward VII in 1898, whose mistress she remained till his death, lightening the dark moods of his later years, and allegedly held considerable influence. Through her younger daughter, Sonia Cubitt, Keppel is the great-grandmother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, second wife of Edward's great-great-grandson Charles, Prince of Wales. Early life Duntreath Castle Alice Frederica Edmonstone (known as \\"Freddie\\" to her family) was born on 29 April 1868 in Woolwich Dockyard, Kent to Mary Elizabeth, n√©e Parsons (1823‚Äì1902) and Sir William Edmonstone, 4th Baronet (1810‚Äì1888), who was serving as Superintendent at the Dockyard at the time. Besides his position as a baronet, her father was a retired admiral in the Royal Navy, and her maternal grandfather had been a governor of the Ionian Islands. She was the youngest of one brother and seven sisters, and while growing up, she was closer to her brother Sir Archibald Edmonstone (Archie) than her sisters. She grew up at Duntreath Castle, the home of the Edmonstone family since the 14th century. The castle had been a wedding gift from King Robert III of Scotland to his daughter Mary Stewart, Princess of Scotland, when she married her fourth husband, Sir William Edmonstone of Culloden, in 1425. Mary and Robert had a son, Sir William Edmonstone of Duntreath. Marriage The Honourable Mrs George Keppel with her daughter Violet in 1899 On 1 June 1891, at the age of 23, she married the Honourable George Keppel, son of the 7th Earl of Albemarle. Keppel was four years older than Alice and was serving as a soldier in the British Army at the time of their marriage. The Keppel family had a history of service to the British royal family as descendants of Arnold Joost van Keppel, who had accompanied King William III to Britain in 1688 and been granted the title Earl of Albemarle in 1696. The Hon. Mr and Mrs George Keppel had two daughters: Violet Trefusis (6 June 1894‚Äì 29 February 1972) and Sonia Rosemary Cubitt (24 May 1900 ‚Äì 16 August 1986). Her husband's lack of money led Keppel to engage in affairs with richer men in order to keep the family up with the lifestyle of London society of those times. Keppel began her first affair with Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe; members of the Keppel family believed that Beckett was the biological father of Keppel's daughter Violet. Keppel also had an affair with Humphrey Sturt, 2nd Baron Alington. Keppel's husband once said of her: \\"I do not mind what she does as long as she comes back to me in the end.\\" Her affairs were conducted with his knowledge, and despite a deep affection for his wife, he also had affairs. \\"Very fond of women himself, he raised no objection to the prince's friendship with his wife\\", stated historian Christopher Hibbert. Despite affairs on both sides, one of her daughters described her parents' marriage as a \\"marriage of companionship of love and laughter\\". Society hostess Keppel became one of the best-known society hostesses of the Edwardian era. In this role, she treated everyone kindly. She was described as being witty, kind and even-tempered. Her eldest daughter Violet wrote that, \\"She not only had a gift of happiness but she excelled in making others happy, she resembled a Christmas tree laden with presents for everyone\\". British writer Sir Harold Acton described Keppel, \\"None could compete with her glamour as a hostess. She could have impersonated Britannia in a tableau vivant and done that lady credit.\\" Keppel was the inspiration for the character \\"Mrs Romola Cheyne\\" in Vita Sackville-West's novel, The Edwardians. She was hailed as one of the beauties of the \\"naughty nineties\\", described as having alabaster skin, large blue eyes, a small waist, chestnut hair and a large bust. Mistress and confidante to Edward VII In 1898, 29 year-old Keppel met Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), the 56 year-old heir apparent to the British throne. Despite a 26 year age difference, she soon became one of Edward's many mistresses. Keppel lived at 30 Portman Square, where Edward regularly visited her; her husband conveniently left during the visits. Her relationship with Edward lasted through his ascension to the throne in 1901 and until his death in 1910. Keppel was one of the few people in Edward VII's circle who was able to smooth his mood swings. Edward's wife, Alexandra of Denmark, was fond of Keppel and tolerant of the liaison. She preferred Keppel to Edward's previous mistress, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, whom she disliked for being indiscreet when she showed off her position. Millicent Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Warwick's half sister, stated that the prince was \\"a much pleasanter child since he changed mistresses\\". Costume Ball, Bal Poudr√© at Warwick Castle in 1895 Through her royal association, Keppel became richer. The king permitted friends such as Sir Ernest Cassel to create endowments that kept her financially secure. Instead of giving her money directly from the Privy Purse, the king gave Keppel shares in a rubber company; these later gained her ¬£50,000, the equivalent of around ¬£7.5 million today. Edward let his own bankers and financial advisers manage her businesses. He also secured a good job for husband which paid a higher salary. According to Christopher Hibbert, \\"George cheerfully went to work for Sir Thomas Lipton, who obligingly found him employment at the prince's instigation.\\" With her influence, Keppel also found her brother Archie a place in the royal household: Archie was Groom in Waiting for the final three years of King Edward VII's reign. Keppel later took care of him and his family. =Position at court= After Edward became king in 1901, Keppel's discretion made her a perfect communicator between the king and his ministers. She knew how to present a topic to him so that he would listen, even if sometimes he disagreed. The Viceroy of India once said that \\"there were one or two occasions when the King was in disagreement with the Foreign Office, and I was able, through her, to advise the King with a view to the foreign policy of the government being accepted.\\" Keppel's influence was founded on her discretion, social finesse, and conversational skill. Her best known contribution to politics was her role as a Liberal hostess. In this role, she acted as a representative for Edward and noted Liberals and was able to help Edward's causes. What influence she had in politics is unknown, but it is stated the king listened to her and depended on her advice. Biographer Raymond Lamont-Brown states: \\"He completely trusted Alice and through her...he could make his political opinion known. A message to Alice was enough to get an arguable topic dropped into conversation to gauge effect, which was reported back to the King.\\" British prime minister H. H. Asquith and his wife Margot once thanked her for her \\"wise counsel\\" in a letter. However, she disliked any mention of her political involvement with the king being made in public. In 1933, when Margot Asquith's memoir was published, she was annoyed that her name was mentioned as the king's political advisor. Though Keppel was known for her persuasiveness, her efforts to encourage the king to abandon his smoking and heavy eating were unsuccessful. Concerned about the king's health, she wrote a letter to the Portuguese Minister Marquis de Soveral, shortly after Edward fell ill: \\"I want you to try and get the King to see proper doctor about his knee....do what you can with your famous tact and of course don't tell anyone I wrote to you.\\" Her letter, although read, was not acted upon. =The King's death= Edward's death made Keppel so hysterical that at his deathbed she had to be dragged out of his room by guards. Embarrassed by her behaviour, she later tried to minimise her dramatic outburst, but eventually admitted that she had been unable to control herself. The Edwardian age was over at the king's death, as was Keppel's reign as favoured mistress. The new king and queen, George V and Mary of Teck, organised the court along more traditional lines, and Keppel was not invited to attend.  Later life  In November 1910, the Keppels left Britain. Keppel stated it was because of her children's education, but in actuality, it was because of the king's death which had made her life change. The family spent two years travelling in the Far East and Ceylon. On their return to Britain they bought a new house at 16 Grosvenor Street in London. During the First World War, Keppel helped her friend Lady Sarah Wilson run a hospital for wounded soldiers in Boulogne. In 1925, Keppel and her husband moved to Italy, buying Villa dell' Ombrellino in Bellosguardo near Florence. The villa had been the home of the scientist Galileo, the poet Foscolo and the scholar C. E. Norton. Keppel commissioned the architect Cecil Pinsent to lay out the villa terrace with bisecting paths, which she named a 'Union Jack garden'; and after her death her daughter Violet maintained the villa and its garden. Keppel and her husband hosted social gatherings at the villa which attracted prominent people in society; among them British prime minister Sir Winston Churchill. During her time in Italy, her daughters remained in the UK because by then, they were both married. Keppel and her husband returned to the UK in 1940, as a result of Second World War. On 11 December 1936, when Edward VII's grandson, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne to marry Wallis Simpson: Keppel, while dining at a restaurant, was heard to say, \\"Things were done much better in my day.\\" =Death= Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori, graves of Alice and George Keppel In 1946, the Keppels returned to their villa in Italy and a year later on 11 September 1947, she died of cirrhosis of the liver. Her husband George died two and a half months later. It was said he could not live without her, having been married for 56 years. They are both buried in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori cemetery in Florence. Later, Italian ushers would point to their villa, and ironically, they would tell tourists that there had lived \\"Mr Keppel, the last lover of Queen Victoria\\".

He most recently played for Barys Astana of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Playing career As a youth, Dallman played in the 1995 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Niagara Falls, Ontario.

On May 18, 2012 Barys Astana team managers refused to extend Dallman's contract. \\"We have agreed with his agent that if the team fulfills its task and reaches the final of the tournament, we will return to discussing the contract's extension. However the team did not reach the final and Dallman did not show his best skills in the playoffs. The issue in question was whether to extend his contract or not. Dallman asked for a four-year extension with significant compensation demands. That is why the decision was made not to extend the contract,\\" Barys president Nurlan Orazbayev said. Dallman signed a two-year contract with SKA Saint Petersburg on May 31, 2012. In May 2014 he returned to Barys Astana, signing a three-year contract.

The original Cheshunt Football Club was formed around 1880 and played in black and white stripes.History Cheshunt F.C. The first recorded game was in 1888, winning 4‚Äì0 against Novocastrians. They won the first Herts Charity Cup in 1900‚Äì01, and went on to win it again in 1903‚Äì04 and 1905‚Äì06. They also reached the FA Amateur Cup semi-final in 1903‚Äì04, losing 2‚Äì0 to Ealing. After leaving the Football Association in 1907 to join the AFA, they then became founder members of the Southern Amateur League in the same year and competed in Section B until World War I,Southern Amateur League 1907‚Äì1930 Non-League Matters They joined the Athenian league in 1919‚Äì20, leaving and rejoining the Southern Amateur in 1920‚Äì21 where they won Section B, before rejoining the Athenian league in 1921‚Äì22. They won the Herts Senior Cup in 1923‚Äì24 beating Hoddesdon 3‚Äì0 in the final. After their best league position of fifth in 1926‚Äì27, Cheshunt's form collapsed and they finished bottom of the Athenian league for the next four seasons. Heavily in debt, they disbanded in 1931 after their landlords, Cheshunt Cricket Club, raised the rent on their Albury Ride ground. =Modern club= The modern club was established in July 1946 at a public meeting in the Co-op Hall in Waltham Cross. A group of local businessmen decided to form a new club for the town, and local junior team Crossbrook Sports were used as the basis for the new club, retaining their amber and black kit. They immediately applied and were accepted into the London League, playing in Division One for the 1946‚Äì47 season. They finished runners-up (recording their biggest-ever win, 11‚Äì0 at Royal Ordnance Factory, in the process) and won the League Cup and Herts Charity Shield. Cheshunt won Division One in 1947‚Äì48 but remained in the same division. They won it again in 1948‚Äì49,London League 1928‚Äì1950 Non-League Matters earning promotion to the Premier Division, and reached the Herts Senior Cup final for the first time. The following season they won the Premier Division, beating Tilbury on the last day of the season to clinch the title from them. They also reached the third round of the Amateur Cup following a run that included defeating holders Bromley in front of a record crowd of 5,000. During the 1950s the club changed leagues several times; they were members of the Delphian League between 1951‚Äì52 and 1954‚Äì55, rejoined the London League in 1955 and then left to become founder members of the Aetolian League in 1959. In 1957‚Äì58 they reached the FA Cup fourth qualifying round for the first time. Cheshunt joined the Spartan League for the 1962‚Äì63 season and won the title at the first attempt. The following season they won the Spartan League Cup, before joining Division Two of the Athenian League in 1964. They finished runners-up in their second season under the management of Terry Medwin, the former Welsh international, and were promoted to Division One, also winning the Herts Charity Shield. The Division One title was won in 1967‚Äì68, beating Wembley in a head-to-head championship decider, to earn promotion to the Premier Division. They won the Mithras Cup in 1969‚Äì70, the London Charity Cup in 1973‚Äì74, the Athenian League Cup and East Anglian Cup in 1974‚Äì75 and the Athenian League Cup again in 1975‚Äì76. They also reached four Herts Senior Cup finals, two Mithras Cup finals as well as solitary East Anglian Cup and Herts Charity Cup finals during the 1970s. Between 1975 and 1995, the club had yellow and blue as its club colours, reverting to amber and black afterwards. After several failed attempts, Cheshunt joined Division Two of the Isthmian League in 1977. In 1981‚Äì82 they finished second, and were promoted to Division One, but were relegated two seasons later. At the start of the 1986‚Äì87 season a mass walkout of Committee, management and players ‚Äì due to budget cuts and demands to see a first team made up of former youth team players ‚Äì led to Cheshunt finishing bottom of Division Two and being relegated into the Spartan League. In 1992‚Äì93 Cheshunt won the Spartan League Cup and finished third in the league, earning promotion back to Division Three of the Isthmian League. They finished second in their first season and were promoted to Division Two, but were relegated at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. However, they made an immediate return to Division Two after finishing third. In 2002‚Äì03 they won the division, and were promoted to Division One. A third-place finish the following year saw them promoted to the Premier Division. At the end of the season the club finished in the relegation zone, but avoided being demoted after Hornchurch went bust. Instead, the club were transferred to the Southern League Premier Division. In 2007‚Äì08 they were relegated, and were placed in Division One North of the Isthmian League. In 2016‚Äì17 the club won the Herts Charity Cup for the third time.

They defeated Marlow 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals and Bracknell Town 3‚Äì0 in the final to secure promotion back to the Premier Division. Stadium Theobalds Lane The original Cheshunt Football Club played at the Recreation Ground on Albury Ride, a ground owned by Cheshunt Cricket Club. The modern club initially played at the Gothic sports ground, before moving to College Road for their second season. In 1949 they moved to the Cheshunt Stadium on Theobalds Lane. Originally a gravel pit, by the 1930s the site had become the local rubbish tip, but between February and October 1949, it was cleared, levelled and a pitch was laid. Two Nissen huts were assembled, where the main gates are today, for changing rooms (with no power, telephone line or hot water), leaving the players with a long walk uphill to the pitch. The ground was opened on 29 October 1949, with the club recording their record home win (11‚Äì1 against Hastings United) in the ground's first fixture. Drainage problems forced the club to abandon the stadium before the 1949‚Äì50 season had ended and move to a new ground on Brookfield Lane. However, they returned to the Cheshunt Stadium in 1952‚Äì53 but again left after a season, due to the poor playing surface, to return to Brookfield Lane though this time as the tenants of Tottenham Hotspur, who were using it as their training ground. At the end of the 1957‚Äì58 season Cheshunt were asked to leave and so returned to the Cheshunt Stadium. Chairman Les Noble and vice-chair Frank Davis moved quickly to secure a 21-year lease on the stadium (which was about to be used by a new club, Waltham Cross FC) and spent ¬£2,500 getting bulldozers in to level space for the present stand and Clubhouse (then the changing rooms too) to be built and clearing the banking to make way for a running track around the pitch (which was removed in the 1980s). The clubhouse and pitch were ready for the opening game of the 1957‚Äì58 season against Wingate. A year later the main stand was built by the groundsman Albert Prior, his son Maurice and chairman Frank Davis in their spare time. It held 400 spectators on bench seats and had a door in the centre to the changing rooms. A covered terrace was built on the other side of the pitch in 1963, although located 20 yards back from the pitch.Peter Miles (1997) The Non-League Football Grounds of Hertfordshire, p9 Floodlights came in 1964, the current function hall three years later. In 1977 the current changing rooms were built, enabling the conversion of the old changing rooms to the clubhouse. In 1982 proper seating was installed for the first time, with the oak seats in the directors box were taken from White Hart Lane's old west stand (which was being demolished) and the plywood seating to the north end of the stand was taken from the relatively new north-west corner of White Hart Lane. In the 2002‚Äì03 season, the section of terracing south of the main stand was covered and named in honour of defender Kirtis Townsend who had died whilst travelling to an away game the previous season and seats originally from the East Stand at Stamford Bridge were installed on the covered terrace. The main stand, the Kirtis Townsend stand and the floodlights were all replaced in the summer of 2015.

The album features sleevenotes written by Mark Sutherland, the former editor of Melody Maker, who refers to the LP as the band's \\"Best of Album\\", whereas the album artwork itself carries the sub-title The Greatest Hits. Background As well as compiling the band's singles from 1994 to 1998, Going For Gold featured newly recorded versions of two previous releases, \\"Dolphin\\" and \\"Ocean Pie\\", alongside brand new material in \\"Disco Down\\" and \\"High Hopes\\". \\"Disco Down\\" went on to become the last Banks-era hit for the band when issued as the album's lead single, two weeks prior to its release, whereas the follow-up single, \\"High Hopes\\", was never issued. Like \\"Disco Down\\", the song was initially included in the album's track listing with the intention for it to be issued as a single,'Polydor: Witter A Bitter Quitter', NME Online, December 1999 but was sidelined post-album release by the band's record label in favour of a proposed re-issue of their 1996 single, \\"Going For Gold\\". Following the band's refusal to comply, Shed Seven and Polydor Records parted company in late 1999, as \\"High Hopes\\" became the only track featured on the compilation which was not a 'hit' single, and Going For Gold became the band's final album release during their time with the label. A limited edition 2-CD set was issued at the same time as the regular album and featured a bonus disc of four newly recorded session tracks ‚Äì one song from each of their four studio albums to date (including Going For Gold itself) ‚Äì two cover versions and a previously unreleased demo. To coincide with the release of the album, the band went on an 8-date 'Greatest Hits' tour of the UK, beginning at Bristol University on 12 May and ending in a hometown gig at York's Barbican Centre on 4 June. Critical reception Going For Gold received mixed reviews upon release. John Harris of Select felt that the album proved that the band have \\"always been blessed with the knack of creating admirably tidy, creditably catchy pop music\\" in his complimentary review, whilst Allmusic's Jason Damas labelled it \\"an excellent compilation of radio-ready rock & roll from one of the best singles bands of the 1990s\\". Howard Johnson of Q gave praise to the band's \\"epic sweep\\", but found fault with Witter's vocals, noting that; NME's Victoria Segal, however, was less impressed with the LP, stating that the album \\"is a flooded engine of a record\\". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian surmised that Going For Gold showed Shed Seven's \\"real talent\\" to be \\"persistence\\" and thought that the album lacked diversity; \\"Few of the tracks diverge from the doggedly catchy guitar rockin' model set by their first hit, Dolphin\\". Chart performance =Album= Going For Gold sold 130,000 copies in the UK, spending a total of four weeks on the UK album chart, peaking at number 7 on 12 June 1999. =Single= \\"Disco Down\\" was the one and only new single taken from the compilation and was the band's final single release from their six years with Polydor Records. It was released on 24 May 1999 and went on to spend a total of four weeks on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 13 on 5 June.

For landline numbers starting with 02, the dialling plan used to be open; the trunk digit and area code could be omitted if the caller was in the same area code as the callee. However, starting May 3, 2008, all landline numbers must be dialled in full.:: A N R C T I :: History =Landlines= Prior to 1990, there was no direct international access. Numbers had 5 digits except for Bucharest, where numbers were 6 digits long. Area code started with 9 and were 2 digits long for Bucharest (90-xxx- xxx) and 3 digits long (9pp-xx-xxx) for the rest of the country. The Bucharest surrounding area had the area code 909, followed by 5 digits number. Somewhere in the end of the 80s, some big cities' area codes were upgraded, including the last digit of the area code into the local number, thus making it 6-digits long. However, calling between non-local areas always required dialling the area code, even when the called party's code was the same as the caller's. For example, a number from Ia»ôi was 981-xx-xxx, then it became 98-1xx-xxx. A number from Suceava was 982-xx-xxx, but then it became 98-2xx-xxx. Apart from Bucharest, Bra»ôov was the first city to have 6-digit numbers. Many smaller town or rural area calling implied using manual commutation circuits operated by humans. Short numbers for special services, like cab companies, were three digits long, starting with 0: * 00 used for checking the phone line. * 01, later 011 local exchange operator (free number) * 02, later 021 telephone line service (possibly telephone service, if bought or rented from the telephone company) * 023 elevators service (only in Bucharest) * 03, later 031 telephone directory * 05, later 051 informations * 055 police (unknown implementation on 2-digit codes) * 058 exact time (every 10 seconds) * 059 weather forecast (recorded message) * 06, later 061 ambulance (free number) * 07, later 071 international calls via operator * 08, later 081 fire brigade (free number) * 09, later 091 domestic calls via operator (reverse charge or calls to manual commutation lines) After 1989, the then-monopolistic state-owned phone company started a process of upgrading its facilities. In 1992, it started increasing the size of a number to 7 digits in Bucharest and 6 digits in the rest of the country and by changing the prefixing scheme. The long distance code was changed from 9 to 0, the area code for Bucharest became 01, while to the rest of the country was temporarily given a 0 before the older area codes. For a short period, the surrounding of Bucharest (now Ilfov county) had the area code 0179, which has been eventually included into the Bucharest numbering plan as 01-79x-xxxx. The 02 code was used for calls to the Republic of Moldova. In 1993, the other counties were given new area codes (30 to 69). The previous area code system did not follow the country administrative regions. Outside county dialing required a national access code 0 (01-xxx-xxxx to Bucharest and 0pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country). In-county calling could be done without prefixes at all (xxx-xxxx to Bucharest and xxx-xxx for the rest of the country). Calling from outside meant +40-1-xxx-xxxx for Bucharest and +40-pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country. An international access code for calling abroad, 00, was adopted. County codes were selected on a geographical order, starting with northern Moldavia (Suceava County had 30), then going southwards to eastern Wallachia, than westwards to Banat, then northern Transylvania and it ends in the southern Transylvania, until the highest prefix, 69 (used for Sibiu County). The short numbers for special services started with 9 and were three digits long. Each town or county has its own special services, callable with the same number throughout the country. =Mobile numbers= The first mobile company was Telemobil (an ancestor of Zapp) and it started its service in 1993 using the analogue NMT technology. The numbers for this network were using the prefix 018-5xx-xxx and 018-6xx-xxx. As 01 was the area code for Bucharest, the mobile numbers had to be dialed with the prefix included, even from Bucharest. Somewhere around 1998, Telemobil changed its technology to Low Emission Mobile System (LEMS) and operated under the brand name SunTel. The service has proven ineffective and has been changed to the current technology used under the name Zapp Mobile. Since SunTel, the prefix has been changed from 018 to 098 (now 0788). In 1996, the first private phone companies, Connex and Dialog, were allotted from the remaining prefixes, which were county-like, 2 digits, prefixes. In the beginning, Connex got the prefix 92 and Dialog got 94. Calling a Connex mobile from any phone in the country was 0-92-xxx-xxx. Afterwards, Connex also got 91 and 93 area codes, Dialog got 95 and 90, the newly founded Zapp Mobile got 98, and Cosmorom 96. Short numbers were now allowed in both the older form and in 4 digits long forms, both with a leading 9. =Toll-free and premium rate= At the same time, no-charge numbers were allocated to special prefixes or to the Bucharest area code, looking like 01800-xxxx . Under a special agreement, even before this reform, foreign operators could be reached at various numbers, usually in the prefix 800 (AT&T; used 01800-1800). The extra- charge numbers were allotted the prefix 0189, being called like 0189-xxx-xxx. This has been extended to all area codes, as 0pp-89x-xxx, and callers could dial them without the area codes, like the regular local calls. This made them too accessible to children and sometimes telephone lines were hijacked to make calls to these services, then to be charged to the line subscribers who never made these calls by themselves. It was very customary to the aggressive advertising to write the costs of the services with small fonts, likely unreadable on the TV screen, then announcing the first 20 seconds free, writing the \\"free\\" word in bigger size, to induce the idea of the calls being all free. One of the most popular premium rate numbering class was (01)8989-xxx, mostly used for media services and TV games. Therefore, the premium rate numbers were mostly known as \\"8989\\". The internet dial-up services used similar numbers, like (01)893-xxxx and (0pp)890-xxx or (0pp)893-xxxx. Some premium-rate internet dial-up services used (01)899-xxxx. However, these services were charged at most twice or three times a local call, unless called from a different area. For a short time before the current numbering plan, two prefixes were implemented for toll-free numbers (080-xxx- xxx) and premium rate numbers (089-xxx-xxx). However, until the implementation of the current numbering plan, all the 018xx and 0xx89 numbers remained unchanged. A special call barring service has been introduced to prevent fraudulent calls to premium rate services. Even today there still are local numbers starting with 89, but only for internet dial-up, and they are migrating to the new prefix 0870. Usually mobile phone users and abroad callers could not and cannot access no-charge or extra-charge numbers. Extra- charge SMS were sent to three digits numbers, each company having its own system. =Later years= In the last years, landline usage started to drop within Romania, as the mobile phones market was growing fast. Mobile phone companies were running out of numbers, as both the main mobile companies claimed millions upon millions of subscribers. Also, as the imminent accession to the EU was going to cause the state-owned company to lose its landline monopoly, a reform was introduced in 2002. This modified the system to a 10 digits system, of which the first is always a national access code 0. The first 4 digits, including the leading 0, give the area code, in the format 0ZYX, where X, Y are digits from 0 to 9 and Z is a digit from 2 to 9. The geographic area codes for Bucharest are 0Z1, with a digit less than all the other area codes and an extra digit to the local number. For example, the Romtelecom area code for Bucharest is 021-xxx-xxxx, and for Neam»õ County is 0233-xxx-xxx. The Z digit gives the type of the area code: *Z=2 and 3 means a landline number; the YX code is 1 (with extra digit for local number) for Bucharest, from 30 to 69 for a county code, and 70 to 79 for non-geographic landline numbers; *Z=7 (and possibly 6 in the future) means a mobile number; 070p-xxxxxx numbers are reserved for virtual operators, while 071p-xxxxxx to 079p-xxxxxx are reserved for certain mobile company code *Z=8 means either a toll-free (0800-xxxxxx), shared cost, personal numbering, virtual cards, pre- paid cards, or internet dial-up numbers *Z=9 means a premium-rate number, like 0900-xxx-xxx; business and financial information and service use 0903-xxx-xxx and adult entertainment use 0906-xxx-xxx Most new landline companies, like UPC Romania (formerly Astral) or Romania Data Systems (RDS), were granted new area codes with Z=3, e.g. 031-xxx-xxxx for Bucharest, and 03pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country. Because these area codes are shared between more companies, the entire number must be dialed, even within the same network. The numbers with Z=2, e.g. 021-xxx-xxxx or 02pp-xxx-xxx, belong almost exclusively to Telekom Romania (formerly called Romtelecom). However, smaller companies were granted numbers with these area codes, like 021-59x-xxxx, and the local numbers are assigned in descending order of the first 3 digits, like (599xxxx, 598xxxx, ..., or 529xxxx, 528xxxx, ...). In Bucharest, local numbers starting with 5 were not used by Romtelecom, hence the usage of this digit. For other counties, if 5 had not been used by Romtelecom, it is preferred for the first digit of numbers of other companies. There are few companies requesting numbering resources with Z=2, and in most cases the companies provide local service only and do not extend their network in the whole country. Formerly within Romtelecom, local numbers were always dialed without area codes, but other numbers were always to be dialed with the area codes, even if it was the same one. However this was changed beginning with May 3, 2008: from that date Romtelecom subscribers can dial full 10 digit numbers for local calls, and since August 1, 2008 they are required to dial the full 10 digit number. The mobile companies use prefixes starting with 7: 71 for Romtelecom, 72 and 73 for Vodafone Romania (previously branded as Connex), 74 and 75 for Orange Romania (previously branded as Dialog), 76 for Telekom Romania Mobile (previously branded as Cosmote), 77 for RCS&RDS;, 78 for Zapp Mobile, etc. The first Romanian MVNO is Enigma System (), which was granted a block of 100000 numbers in the 070 block (like 07000-xxxxx), on 27 September 2011.Licen»õa de utilizare a resurselor de numerota»õie a Enigma System (in Romanian) Free phone numbers start with 800 (like 0-800-xxx-xxx). Strangely, some companies to whom a numbering class is allocated may not grant toll-free access to those numbers for other networks. Therefore, sometimes a \\"toll-free\\" number is advertised as \\"toll free only within some operator\\". Some 08pp prefixes are used for various services, like: * 0801 for shared-cost numbers * 0802 for personal numbering * 0806 for virtual cards * 0807 for pre-paid cards * 087p for Internet dial-up; for the moment, only 0870 is used Extra-charge numbers start with 90p, with some service types with their own prefixes, like business and financial information (0903) and adult entertainment (0906). There are few used prefixes in the 09pp range, the rest of them are stated as reserved, unlike for the 08pp range, which holds more service types, either toll-free or not. The former extra-charge numbers were starting with 021-89-xxxxx for Bucharest and 02pp-89x-xxx for the other regions, thus being a subset of the numbers owned by Romtelecom. Currently these numbers are sometimes used for premium rate or normal Internet dial-up services. The usage of these numbers for such services is however discouraged, as the new prefix for Internet dial-up is 0870. There are some dial-up services using these numbers, and most of them begin with (021- or 02pp-)893 or 899. Calling from Romania to Romania usually implies using the full 10 digits number. Romtelecom county codes were chosen on a geographical order, starting with northern Moldavia (Suceava County had 30), then going southwards to eastern Wallachia, than westwards to southern Transylvania, than northwards, closing the circle with the highest prefix, 69 (used for Sibiu County). These county codes were extended to all landline area codes. Extra-charge SMS are sent to three or four digits numbers, each company having its own system. Short numbers are allowed in both the 3 digits and in 4 digits forms, with a leading 9, like 981 for the fire brigade, 961 for ambulance, 955 for police or 9xxx for various companies, including taxi, medical services, guards, information and others. Each town or county has its own special services, like firefighters, police, with the same number. The station to which these calls are directed is chosen based on location. Unlike for Bucharest, other regions use short numbers with 3 digits only, including the leading 9. These services are provided by Romtelecom, therefore the area code must be dialed before the number when calling from other network. The short local numbers which are the same in the whole country are: * 02YX-922 Romtelecom devices service (for phones and other equipment bought or rented from Romtelecom), 021-9222 for Bucharest * 02YX-925 Romtelecom GBM sales and customer support, 021-9255 for Bucharest * 02YX-923 or 02YX-926 elevator service, 021-923(x) or 021-926(x) for more companies in Bucharest * 02YX-928 former local gas company; new companies use other numbers; in Bucharest 021-928x for more gas companies * 02YX-929 electricity company; 021-9291 for Bucharest and 021-9292 for surrounding area * 02YX-953 former state-owned taxi company; the privatised company still holds this number, 021-9531 for Bucharest * 02YX-954 former state-owned freight taxi company; the privatised company still holds this number, 021-9541 for Bucharest * 02YX-955 police, 021-9555 for Bucharest; no longer toll-free since the implementation of 112 * 02YX-956 gendarmerie, 021-9566 for Bucharest; formerly a taxi company number in Bucharest * 02YX-959 Border police, 021-9590 for Bucharest; (probably on counties along the country border or holding international airports) * 02YX-961 state-owned ambulance and medical service 021-9611 for Bucharest; allegedly no longer toll-free since the implementation of 112 * 971 international calls via operator (this Romtelecom service is an exception and keeps the original short format even after August 1, 2008) * 02YX-981 fire brigade, 021-9811 for Bucharest; allegedly no longer toll-free since the implementation of 112 * 991 domestic calls via operator, for reverse charge calls (this Romtelecom service is another exception and keeps the original short format even after August 1, 2008) Some short numbers are used for network services, for rotary telephones which cannot dial * and #. Romania joined the European initiative for a continent-wide emergency number, 112. With the implementation of this service, the former emergency numbers are no longer toll-free, unless they are redirected to 112. Number portability is planned to be available after October 21, 2008. Besides the 112 service, and the reserved 11x numbers, a number may not begin with 1. There are some special codes which start with 1: * 10xx carrier selection, with intermediate tone * 16xx carrier selection, followed by number * 19x(...) nationwide short numbers (implemented since May 2, 2008) ** 1921 Romtelecom phone line service ** 1930 Romtelecom sales and customer support ** 118932 Romtelecom directory information ** 1932 Romtelecom directory information in Hungarian language ** 1951 Various information service ** 1957 telegrams ** 1958 current time announcement (every 10 seconds) When calling from abroad, the leading zero is dropped and replaced with the international access code and the country code, like +40-xxx-xxx-xxx. Only regular landline and mobile phones are accessible from outside Romania. When calling abroad from Romania, the international access code is 00.

They reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time in the 2008‚Äì09 season. In 2005, they entered the Southern League Premier Division for the first time in their history but were relegated after just one season. They are affiliated to the Worcestershire County Football Association. History Evesham United FC was founded shortly after World War II by returning servicemen, replacing the town's earlier club Evesham Town, who had reached the FA Amateur Cup final in 1923. The new club started life in the Worcester League before switching to the Worcestershire Combination in 1951, winning the league title in their second season in the league. After a second title win in 1955 they switched to the Birmingham & District League where they were coached by former Coventry City captain Charlie Timmins during the 1960‚Äì61 season. In 1962 the club left the Birmingham League and, after a short spell in the Warwickshire League, rejoined the Worcestershire Combination, which was renamed the Midland Combination soon afterwards, and in which they were to remain until 1992. During this time they claimed three more league titles, after the last of which they stepped up to the Southern League. In the 2004‚Äì05 season former Coventry City player David Busst led them to promotion to the Premier Division but the club was relegated straight back down after just one season. In 2008 the club reached the FA Cup first round for the first time. They eventually lost 2‚Äì0 away to Torquay United. Earlier in the competition they defeated Rushden and Diamonds of the Conference 2‚Äì0 with a brace from Danny Scheppel. Ground The club initially played at Crown Meadow but in 1969 moved to Common Road. In 2006 they sold this ground off for housing and ground-shared with Worcester City while a new purpose- built stadium was constructed on the outskirts of the town. In March 2011 the new ground was completed, but due to safety and traffic issues it could not be used until a nearby roundabout was modified to allow easier access to the ground. Therefore, the club continued to play at St George's Lane for the 2011-12 season. On 7 July 2012 the club's new ground was officially opened by former Manchester United and Aston Villa manager Ron Atkinson,BBC Sport, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-18754529, 2012 and announced as the Spiers and Hartwell Jubilee Stadium. The first match played there took place between a Manchester United Legends side and Evesham United Old Boys. They currently are in a groundshare deal with National League South side Gloucester City.

Usually it is a steel bar or rod that runs inside the neck, beneath the fingerboard. Some are non-adjustable, but most modern truss rods have a nut at one or both ends that adjusts its tension. The first truss rod patent was applied for by Thaddeus McHugh, an employee of the Gibson company, in 1921, Patent on truss rod. Note that the diagram in McHugh's patent document shows an incorrect design for the truss rod channel. The channel is shallower in the middle, so the truss rod is installed with a backbow. Tightening the rod increases neck relief, acting in concert with string tension, rather than reduce relief in opposition to string tension. though the idea of a \\"truss rod\\" appears in patents as early as 1908. A patent on instrument that is \\"designed like harp guitar\\", but it mentions \\"truss rod\\" concept \\"to prevent a head springing under the strain of strings\\". Application Cross-section of an electric guitar neck showing the position of the truss rod A guitar neck made of wood is prone to bending due mainly to atmospheric changes, and the pull created by changing to a different gauge of guitar strings and/or different tuning. A truss rod keeps the neck straight by countering the pull of the strings and natural tendencies in the wood. When the truss rod is loosened, the neck bends slightly in response to the tension of the strings. Similarly, when tightened, the truss rod straightens the neck by resisting string tension. Guitar technicians usually adjust a guitar neck to have a slight relief (forward bend) to achieve reasonably low action in high fretboard positions, while letting strings ring clearly in low positions. A lower action in the high fret positions also facilitates more accurate intonation with less compensation at the bridge. Relief achieved through the truss rod combines with the height of the bridge to affect the playability of the instrument. The two should be adjusted in concert with each other. Too much relief can make a neck feel floppy, slow and lifeless‚Äîwhile too little can make the strings buzz on the frets. Relief is typically measured as the distance between the string and the 7th fret while holding down the first and last fret. The amount of relief many guitar manufacturers prefer for an electric guitar is about .007 inches at the 7th fret.Truss Rod Adjustment article on the Guitar Repair Bench Luthier Website Truss rods are required for instruments with steel (high tension) strings. Without a truss rod, the guitar's wooden neck would gradually warp (i.e. bend) beyond repair due to applied high tension. Such devices are not normally needed on instruments with lower tension strings, such as the classical guitar, which uses nylon (previously catgut) strings. Truss rods also allow builders to make instrument necks from less rigid materials, such as cheaper grade of wood, or man-made composites. Without a truss rod, many of these materials would be unable to properly handle string tension at normal neck dimensions. The neck can also be made thinner, which may improve playability. In fact, the 1923 patent touts the possibility of using cheaper materials as an advantage of the truss rod. Before truss rods, builders had to make the neck out of a very rigid wood, and achieve relief by laboriously planing the fingerboard. The truss rod is not specifically for adjusting intonation or action (height of the strings above the fingerboard) though adjusting it can make an instrument more easily playable. Construction and action Truss rods are frequently made out of steel, though graphite and other materials are sometimes used. The truss rod can be adjusted to compensate for expansion or contraction in the neck wood due to changes in humidity or temperature, or to compensate for changes in the tension of the strings (the thicker the guitar string, the higher its tension when tuned to correct pitch) or using different tunings (the lower the pitch of each string, the lower its tension). Usually, the truss rod of a brand-new instrument is adjusted by the manufacturer before sale. Normally, turning the truss rod's adjustment bolt clockwise tightens it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. Turning the bolt counter-clockwise loosens it, allowing string tension to act on the neck and creating a forward bow (higher string action). Some guitars (notably Rickenbackers) come with dual truss rods that are more stable and not affected by seasonal climate changes. These rods are regarded as being more difficult to adjust. Location and adjustment Truss rod adjustment bolt visible from the side of headstock Adjustment bolt visible through the sound hole. The truss rod tension is usually controlled using an adjustment bolt (a hex nut or allen key). Depending on the model of guitar, this bolt can be located: * On older Fender-style electric guitars with bolt-on necks (and vintage re-issues) -- on the heel of the neck. Adjustment of such truss rods can be done by a Phillips screwdriver and requires prior removal of the guitar's pickguard or neck. * On newer Fender-style electric guitars -- behind the nut, uncovered and can usually be adjusted by a 1/8\\" (3 mm) Allen wrench. * On Fender American Elite Series -- an adjustment wheel at the base of the neck on the top of the instrument. * On set-neck electrics -- under a cover-plate behind the nut. Gibson & Epiphone guitars have their truss rod bolt covered with a signature bell-shaped plate. Most Gibson electrics have a 5/16‚Äù (8 mm) or a 1/4\\" (6 mm) hex adjustable truss rod nut that can be adjusted with a hex box spanner wrench. * On acoustic guitars -- inside the guitar body, accessible through the sound hole, or on the headstock. Martins use a 3/16\\" (5 mm) Allen wrench and Gibson uses the same as for the Gibson electrics above. Modern designs also include adjustment from the side of the heel of a bolt-on neck. When looking from the body of the guitar to the head, counterclockwise adjustment decreases the truss rod tension (correct an underbow) and clockwise adjustment increases the truss rod tension (correct an overbow). Installing a truss rod in a newly constructed guitar requires woodworking capabilities. Special tools are required including a router with a variety of bits and ability to work with metals. Completed truss rods can be purchased through suppliers or manufactured according to specifications given in literature. Dual action truss rod A dual action (also known as two way or double expanding) truss rod is a more modern design and it is currently being used by some luthiers in lieu of the vintage single truss rod. The dual action rod is installed in a straight channel in the wood as opposed to the curved channel used by vintage rods. The two-way rod can warp the neck in either direction, either creating more relief or less. A neck with a two way rod installed is often more stable and less influenced by climate changes, as well as being able to restraighten twisted necks, which can be a hefty repair for other guitars. However, some players believe the dual action truss system has an adverse effect on the tone of the instrument, due to the weight of the second rod and the additional wood removal required for installation (although not all two-way systems use a second rod.)

It is a spinoff and prequel to their popular game Rifts, which uses a similar form of Palladium's Megaversal system. History In the early 2000, Palladium was experiencing a downward trend, so to try to offset decreasing sales, Palladium continued creating new settings; as a result the brand new game Rifts Chaos Earth (2003), a prequel to Rifts, was released and soon supplemented by a few sourcebooks (2003). Description Chaos Earth was originally intended to be a parallel dimension to Rifts where the massive deaths were caused a minute after midnight when the released Potential Psychic Energy (P.P.E.) was magnified. Everything that happened in Rifts happened on a smaller scale in Chaos Earth. In Chaos Earth, most of humanity survives and has to fend off the supernatural. This game style can be played in Palladium's Nightbane series. Sometime after its original press description in an early Rifter, the game changed from a parallel dimension to Rifts history, perhaps due to the level of interest in Rifts' past. Now in the Palladium Megaverse, the Chaos Earth setting is the period in Earth during which the rips in space- time known as rifts ripped apart mankind. Chaos Earth gives players a chance to play in a world somewhat more recognizable than the world of Rifts. Monsters are only starting to appear and there the forces of humanity are still trying to hold on to the civilized world that Earth had been, as opposed to Rifts where characters live in a world where violence and horror have been commonplace for centuries.

Specifically, the mission was established to oversee and maintain the multilateral ceasefire of 1990 and the subsequent Bicesse Accords in 1991, which instituted an electoral process for the first time including the two rival factions of the civil war, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the de facto government of Angola, with control of Luanda and most of the country since independence in 1975, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The mission's original mandate was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 696 (1991), passed on May 30, 1991. The stated mandate was: > to verify the arrangements agreed by the Angolan parties for the monitoring > of the ceasefire and for the monitoring of the Angolan police during the > ceasefire period. The subsequent resolution Resolution 747 (1992), passed March 24, 1992 altered the mandate to include electoral monitoring duties. During the country's newly agreed upon election, 400 UN electoral observers were deployed, along with the rest of the mission, with the added mandate of \\"observation and verification of the presidential and legislative elections in Angola.\\" After a series of Security Council resolutions in 1993, the mandate was again altered to encourage more stringent adherence to the ceasefire by both the government of Angola and UNITA, after a resumption of hostilities. Finally, in late 1994, with Security Council Resolutions 952 (1994) and 966 (1994), UNAVEM II began observation and verification of the Lusaka Protocol of November 20, 1994. Preparations were begun to make way for the new mission, United Nations Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III), set up in the wake of the Lusaka Protocol. The mission consisted of military observers, civilian police, electoral observers, paramedics and both local and international staff. The personnel came from 25 countries in five continents. There was a maximum deployment of over 1100 during the early polling, as well as a minimum strength of under 200 after June 1993. UNAVEM II suffered a total of 5 fatalities, 3 military and 2 civilian. Background Soon after Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, the tenuous three-way coalition government descended into civil war. The MLPA, with the support of Cuban troops as well as backing by the Soviet Union and other communist parties, quickly gained control of Luanda and the government, and the UNITA, allied with the tribal National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) was restricted to the country's interior. The first UN peacekeeping mission to Angola, United Nations Angola Verification Mission I (UNAVEM I) oversaw the agreed upon Cuban withdrawal in 1988. That same year, the South African troops supporting UNITA were withdrawn and by 1990 the belligerents, joined by eighteen other African nations agreed to a ceasefire. In mid-1991, the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of UNAVEM II to succeed UNAVEM I and monitor the new ceasefire agreement. The 1991 Bicesse Accords established a democratic electoral system for Angola, under the supervision of UNAVEM II. After the 1992 call to arms by disgruntled UNITA presidential candidate Jonas Savimbi, hostilities resumed until 1994's Lusaka Protocol.

It is located in the district of Simele. The village is divided into lower and upper sections. In Avzrog Shano, there is a church of Mar Gewargis, and in Avzrog Miri, there is an Armenian Apostolic church of Sourp Vartan. Etymology The name of the village is derived from \\"av\\" (\\"water\\" in Kurdish) and \\"zer\\" (\\"yellow\\" in Kurdish), and thus Avzrog translates to \\"yellow water\\". History Avzrog Miri was founded in 1933 by Kurdish-speaking Armenians from the village of Gaznar, near Van in Turkey, who had taken refuge at Zakho amidst the Armenian Genocide in 1915-1917, during the First World War, whereas Avzrog Shano was settled by Syriac-speaking Assyrians in 1936. The former was mostly inhabited by Armenians, with some Assyrians, whilst the latter was exclusively inhabited by Assyrians. A Syriac school was built at Avzrog Shano in 1947, and an Arabic school at Avzrog Miri was constructed in 1950. In the Iraqi census of 1957, Avzrog Miri was populated by 176 people. The eruption of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961 spurred the villagers of Avzrog Shano to flee and seek refuge elsewhere until the war's conclusion in 1970, during which time, the village was looted and burned in four separate attacks. However, the villagers' return was short-lived as both Avzrog Miri and Avzrog Shano were destroyed and their inhabitants displaced by the Iraqi government in 1975, at which time the former had a population of 50 families, and 60 families in the latter. As part of the government's policy of Arabisation, the village was resettled by Arabs. In the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, the Arab settlers fled, 25 Assyrian families returned to Avzrog Shano, and the Armenians began to gradually return to Avzrog Miri in 1996 after the construction of 65 houses. At Avzrog Miri, the church of Sourp Vartan was built in 2002, and the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs constructed 20 houses and a hall, renovated the school and church, and developed the infrastructure of Avzrog Shano in the following year. More Armenians returned to Avzrog Miri in 2005 after the restoration of 40 houses, construction of 20 new houses, and development of the village's infrastructure by the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs. Avzrog Miri was visited by Archbishop Avak Asadourian in 2011, and was inhabited by 390 Armenians and 200 Chaldean Catholics in 2012. In the same year, 600 Syriac Orthodox Christians and 185 Chaldean Catholics resided at Avzrog Shano. The Assyrian Aid Society provided humanitarian aid to the village on 2 September 2014, and on 27 January 2015. Notable people *Aram Shahin Davud Bakoyan (b. 1954), Iraqi-Armenian politician.

Features The classic NoScript menu in Firefox =Active Content Blocking= By default, NoScript blocks active (executable) web content, which can be wholly or partially unblocked by allowlisting a site or domain from the extension's toolbar menu or by clicking a placeholder icon. In the default configuration, active content is globally denied, although the user may turn this around and use NoScript to block specific unwanted content. The allowlist may be permanent or temporary (until the browser closes or the user revokes permissions). Active content may consist of JavaScript, web fonts, media codecs, WebGL, and Flash. The add-on also offers specific countermeasures against security exploits. Because many web browser attacks require active content that the browser normally runs without question, disabling such content by default and using it only to the degree that it is actually necessary reduces the chances of vulnerability exploitation. In addition, not loading this content saves significant bandwidth and defeats some forms of web tracking. NoScript is also useful for developers to see how well their site works with JavaScript turned off. It can also remove many irritating web elements, such as in-page pop-up messages and certain paywalls, which require JavaScript in order to function. NoScript takes the form of a toolbar icon or status bar icon in Firefox. It displays on every website to denote whether NoScript has either blocked, allowed, or partially allowed scripts to run on the web page being viewed. Clicking or hovering (since version 2.0.3rc1) the mouse cursor on the NoScript icon gives the user the option to allow or forbid the script's processing. NoScript's interface, whether accessed by right-clicking on the web page or the distinctive NoScript box at the bottom of the page (by default), shows the URL of the script(s) which are blocked, but does not provide any sort of reference to look up whether or not a given script is safe to run. With complex webpages, users may be faced with well over a dozen different cryptic URLs and a non-functioning webpage, with only the choice to allow the script, block the script or to allow it temporarily.

Some say this geothermically active region was the inspiration for the myth of the Chimera. Mount Chimaera was the name of a place in ancient Lycia, notable for constantly burning fires. It is thought to be the area called Yanarta≈ü in Turkey, where methane and other gases emerge from the rock and burn. Some ancient sources considered it to be the origin of the myth of the monster called the Chimera, because of similarities described below. Ctesias is the oldest traceable author to offer this euhemerizing theory. We know of this because of a citation by Pliny the Elder, who in his second book of Historia Naturalis identified the Chimera with the permanent gas vents in Mount Chimaera, in the country of the ancient Lycian city of Phaselis, which he described as being \\"on fire\\", adding that it \\"...indeed burned with a flame that does not die by day or night.\\" Pliny was quoted by Photius and Agricola. Strabo and Pliny are the only surviving ancient sources who would be expected to discuss a Lycian toponym, but the placename is also attested by Isidore of Seville and Servius, the commentator on the Aeneid. Strabo held the Chimaera to be a ravine on a different mountain in Lycia, placing it unhesitatingly in the vicinity of the Cragus Mountains, the southern part of the present Babadaƒü, some 75 km due west as the crow flies, and Isidore quotes writers on natural history (see below) that Mount Chimaera was on fire here, had lions and goats there, and was full of snakes over there. Servius goes so far as to arrange these with the lions on the peak of the mountain, pastures full of goats in the middle, and serpents all about the base, thus imitating Homer's description of the monster. The site was identified by Sir Francis Beaufort in 1811, as the modern Turkish Yanar or Yanarta≈ü, which was described by Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt in his Travels in Lycia, Milyas, and the Cibyratis, in company with the late Rev. E. T. Daniell. The discussion on the connection between the myth and the exact location of Mount Chimera was started by Albert Forbiger in 1844, and George Ewart Bean was of the opinion that the name was allochthonous and could have been transferred here from its original location further west, as cited by Strabo, owing to the presence of the same phenomenon and the fires. The fires of Yanarta≈ü at night. Testimonia *Fingunt et Chimaeram triformem bestiam; ore leono, postremis partibus draco, media caprea. Quam quidam Physiologi non animal, sed Ciliciae montem esse aiunt, quibusdam locis leones and capreas nutrientem, quibusdam ardentem, quibusdam plenum serpentibus. Hunc Bellorophontes habitabilem fecit, unde Chimaeram dicitur occidisse. Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 11.3.36 ** The Chimera is depicted as a three-formed beast; a lion in front, a python in its hinder parts, goatlike in the middle. Certain writers on natural history say it isn't an animal, but a mountain in Cilicia, which in some places feeds lions and goats, in some burns, in some is full of snakes. Bellerophon made this habitable, whence he is said to have \\"killed Chimaera\\". ***Isidore unetymologically connected Lycia and Cilicia, as below. *Lycia nuncupata quod ab oriente adjuncta Ciliciae sit. Nam habet ab ort√ª Ciliciam, ab occas√ª et meridie mare, a septentrione Cariam. Ibi est mons Chimaera, qui noctibus aestibus ignem exhalat: sicut in Sicili√¢ Aetna et Vesuvius in Campani√¢.

At the junction of one of these masses of scaglia with the serpentine, is the Yanar, famous as the Chim√¶ra of the ancients, rediscovered in modern times by Captain Beaufort. It is nothing more than a stream of inflammable gas issuing from a cavern, such as is seen in several places among the Apennines. The serpentine immediately around the flame is burnt and ashy, but this is only for a foot or two, the immediate neighborhood of the Yanar presenting the same aspect as it wore in the days of Seneca, who writes \\"Laeta itaque regio est et herbida, nil flammis adurentibus\\" Letters 79,3 Such is the Chim√¶ra-- *:...flammis que armata chim√¶ra*-- :deprived of all its terrors.

It is nicknamed The Valley, and plays its home matches at Butlin Road. It was originally named New Bilton Juniors and renamed four times. First, in 1956, to Valley Sports. The next time was in 1971 to Valley Sports Rugby, or simply VS Rugby, then in 2000 to Rugby United, and again for the most recent time to Rugby Town F.C. in 2005. History Formed by Keith Coughlan and under the name of New Bilton Juniors, the Valley played its first friendly match in 1955. In 1956, the club was renamed for the first time, to Valley Sports and entered the Rugby and District Football League. The club progressed to the Coventry and North Warwickshire Football League in 1963, and to the United Counties League in 1969 changing the name to VS Rugby. The club initially played at Thornfield and then briefly at Hillmorton Recreation ground when Thornfield was taken over for the sports centre before groundsharing with the then Southern Football League side Rugby Town at Oakfield. VS Rugby moved into their own ground, Butlin Road, in 1973 the first competitive game there being a 0‚Äì0 draw against Burton Park Wanderers in the United Counties League. In 1975 the club was invited to join the West Midlands League, and took part in the FA Cup for the first time in 1976, being knocked out in the first qualifying round. In 1981, the Valley's most successful manager, Jimmy Knox, took over. He had previously successfully managed the then Rugby Town (for whom he had also made 452 appearances) and AP Leamington. Knox turned around the club's fortunes dramatically and in 1983 they won The FA Vase, defeating Halesowen Town 1‚Äì0. For the 1983/84 season the club joined the Southern League where success continued with the club winning The Midland Division in 1986/87, The Southern League Cup in 1989/90 and The Birmingham Senior Cup in 1988/89 and 1991/92. During Jimmy Knox's 11 years at Butlin Road the Valley had much success in the FA Cup, their best being a run to the second round in 1987/88 being knocked out by Bristol Rovers after a drawn game at Butlin Road. They also had memorable cup ties against Northampton Town, Bristol City, and Leyton Orient. In August 1991, VS Rugby played and beat a strong Manchester United side 1‚Äì0 at Butlin Road in a testimonial match to recognise Knox's ten years at the club. United manager Alex Ferguson honoured a verbal agreement made through Knox's brother Archie, who was United‚Äôs Assistant Manager. Once Knox left the club in 1992 its fortunes started to decline and despite reaching the second round of The FA Cup again in the 1992/93 season they were relegated and the then chairman put the club into receivership. A group of supporters that included founder Keith Coughlan, however, rescued the club, and manager Ron Bradbury stayed on to gain promotion behind newly formed Rushden & Diamonds in 1994. The same season the club also again reached the first round of The FA Cup losing at home to Brentford. VS Rugby changed its name to Rugby United in 2000, and to Rugby Town in 2005. Valley came close to promotion twice under manager Dave Stringer in the 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 seasons. In 2012‚Äì13 they missed out on the title on the final day before losing to Biggleswade Town in the play-off final at Butlin Road. The following season saw Valley once again in contention for the title on the final day only to fail to secure top spot. Promotion hopes once again ended in the play-offs after a defeat to Slough Town over two legs in the semi-final. The 2014/15 season was less successful for Valley with the club failing to make the play-offs after an inconsistent season. At the end of the campaign, Rugby Town parted company with manager Dave Stringer. For the first time in the club's history, Rugby Town were moved into the Northern Premier League system for the 2015‚Äì16 season. Stringer's replacement, former Rushden & Diamonds midfielder Gary Mills, tendered his resignation early into the season after a poor start and was replaced by ex-Tamworth boss Dale Belford. Rugby recovered and finished the season in ninth place before Belford left the club by mutual consent. At the start of the 2016/17 season James Jepson was appointed manager but lasted but a few weeks being replaced by former player Gary Moran in September 2016. Moran could not guide Rugby away from the relegation zone and they were condemned to relegation to the Midland Football League on the final day of the season with Moran resigning shortly afterwards. Former manager Dave Stringer returned to the role of manager in May 2017 after leaving Chasetown. Rugby Town parted company with manager Dave Stringer in May 2018 and he was subsequently replaced in the same month by Stratford Town F.C. manager Carl Adams. Ground The ground, unlike many in non-league circles, has covering on all four sides of the ground and seating on two sides. The official capacity was confirmed as 5,375 in 2005 but this is set to increase with the new 1,300 covered terrace at the allotment end as well as further terracing developments throughout the stadium. Now, approximately 2,800 spectators are able to be accommodated under cover and 740 of these can also be seated. The main stand, which holds 500 fans and also includes the dressing rooms. Helped by a Football Foundation & Stadia Improvement Fund Grant, the stand was open for use in early 2003, but it was not officially opened until August 2003, when ex-England International Darius Vassell did the honours as Rugby played an Aston Villa XI. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw the introduction of new dugouts at Butlin Road. The ex-Filbert Street structures have a strip of Astroturf laid in front of the dugout area to stop wear and tear.

Frizzell was appointed a patron of Oldham Athletic's supporters' trust, Trust Oldham in 2004. Playing career Frizzell began his playing career at Greenock Morton as a forward in 1957. Three years later, he joined Oldham Athletic, where he played 318 matches and scored 57 goals initially as a forward and then in the wing-half and full-back roles. Managerial career A managerial career was started in March 1970 when Frizzell became manager of Oldham Athletic, following a spell as a coach under Jack Rowley. At the time, the club was near the bottom of Division Four, with the distinct possibility of having to re-apply for League status. He then guided the team to nine wins and six draws in the remaining 22 matches and a comfortable midtable finish. In the following season Oldham achieved promotion to Division Three and in 1974 they won the Third Division championship. The club survived in the Second Division bar only a couple of flirts with relegation, yet despite his success at the helm of the club, Frizzell was surprisingly dismissed in June 1982. He was at the time the second longest serving manager in the Football League. After a year unemployed, Frizzell was invited to join Manchester City as an assistant to Billy McNeill. He became manager after the exit of his former boss in October 1986. Frizzell was sacked in May 1987 as the team was relegated to the Division Two under a serious financial crisis. He returned to the club in 1994 to work as chief scout but left in 1998. Death Frizzell died on 3 July 2016.

Her research interests include vision in birds, animal signalling, behavioural synchrony, animal consciousness and animal welfare. Education Dawkins was educated at Queen's College, London and Somerville College, Oxford where she earned bachelor's and PhD (1970) degrees. Her doctoral research was supervised by Niko Tinbergen. Career and research Dawkins was appointed a lecturer in zoology in 1977 and in 1998 was made Professor of Animal Behaviour. She is currently (2014) Head of the Animal Behaviour Research Group and is the Director of the John Krebs Field Laboratory. Dawkins has written extensively on animal behaviour and issues of animal welfare. Along with other academics in the field, such as Ian Duncan, Dawkins promoted the argument that animal welfare is about the feelings of animals. This approach indicates the belief that animals should be considered as sentient beings. Dawkins wrote, \\"Let us not mince words: Animal welfare involves the subjective feelings of animals. In 1989, Dawkins published a study in which she filmed hens from above while they performed common behaviours (e.g. turning, standing, wing-stretching). From these films, she calculated the amount of floor-space required by the hens during these behaviours and compared this to the amount of floor-space available in battery cages. She was able to show that many of these common behaviours were highly restricted, or prevented, in battery cages. In 1990, she contributed to a paper in which she developed her ideas regarding how to assess animal welfare by asking questions of animals. She proposed using preference tests and consumer demand studies to ask what animals prefer (e.g. space, social contact) and how highly motivated they are for these. She argued that animals were more likely to suffer if they were not provided with resources for which they are highly motivated. Central to her most recent (2012) view on animal welfare is scepticism about whether science can establish that animals have consciousness and therefore its role in definition and measurement of animal welfare and suffering. Instead, her view is that good animal welfare rests on determining the needs and wants of animals, which do not require that they are conscious., ( cloth) These theses are presented in her book Why Animals Matter: Animal Consciousness, Animal Welfare, and Human Well-being (2012). Her views on animal consciousness have been criticised by evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, who argues that she too readily rejects anthropomorphic research on animals. She responded to the criticism by stating her position as \\"wrongly interpreted\\", and says that \\"my concern is to make the case for animal emotions as watertight as possible and thereby to strengthen it. That is the way science progresses and always has.\\"Dawkins, Marian Stamp (2012) Convincing the Unconvinced That Animal Welfare Matters Huffington Post, 8 June 2012.Dawkins, Marian Stamp (2013) What do animals want?

He is the older brother of Arve Walde. Career Walde found success on the highest level in his first season as a senior. He played 23 of 26 league matches for SK Brann and got two caps for the Norwegian U21 national football team in 2002. Though a good season for Walde personally, SK Branns had a catastrophic 2002 season, and were close to being relegated. The club's coach and the man responsible for Walde's push, Teitur Thordarson, was sacked and the club's junior coach Mons Ivar Mjelde took over as head coach. After Mjelder took over, Walde found it hard to gain a regular spot on the team, with only 3 league matches in 2003. He was loaned out to FK Haugesund in 2004, but could not help the club from being relegated from the Adeccoliga. He returned to Brann in 2005, only to be loaned out again, this time to the local Adeccoliga club L√∏v-Ham. The transfer was made permanent the autumn of 2005. =L√∏v-Ham= Walde impressed both local media and opponents in the Adeccoliga, and was one of the main reasons for L√∏v-Ham dodging relegation in both 2005 and 2006. Despite being one of the smallest team in the league and close to be relegated, L√∏v-Ham was one of the clubs in the league with the fewest goals scored against them. This was highly attributed to Walde and his partner in the center defense, Kristian Vange. Walde was also made captain for L√∏v-Ham before the 2006 seasons. He returned to L√∏v-Ham on loan again before the 2008-season. =Back in Brann= After the 2006 season, several Tippeliga teams showed an interest in Walde, but he chose to stay in L√∏v-Ham, due to his studies in Bergen. He continued to impress in the Adeccoliga and before the transfer-window opened on 1 July 2007, Sandefjord once again tried to get Walde's signature. However, an SK Brann with only 3 centre backs also signaled an interest in Walde. After Brann's first choice, Per \\"Pelle\\" Nilsson showed himself to expensive for Brann, the club turned their focus to Walde. The parts came to an agreement on 2 July, and so Walde was once again a part of the SK Brann squad. He did, however, not reach the expectations, and was, once again, loaned out to L√∏v-Ham the following season. After the 2009 season, Walde decide to take a break from football to pursuit his studies in physiatrics. He carried out his medical service () at Stavanger University Hospital.

In the original 1933 film he was the first mate of the ship named the Venture, while in its 2005 remake he was a playwright (the less faithful 1976 remake had an analogous character named Jack Prescott, played by Jeff Bridges). He was played by Bruce Cabot in the original and by Adrien Brody in the remake. In both versions he is one of the main heroes of the story, a man who is on a ship heading for the mysterious Skull Island where Carl Denham intends to make a film. On the way, Driscoll falls in love with the actress, Ann Darrow, and when she is kidnapped by a giant ape on the island named Kong, Driscoll rescues her after helping to lead a search. Beyond these facts, even his characterization is quite different in the two films. Driscoll is a supporting character in Kong: King of Skull Island, an \\"authorized\\" illustrated-novel that continues the Kong story in 1957. Driscoll is also a playable character in the video game Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, along with Kong himself. 1933 film In the 1933 film, Driscoll is a rugged sailor, the Ventures first mate, who disdains having women on ships, considering even their mere presence to be a \\"nuisance\\". He says as much to Ann Darrow, but despite this early encounter, and while still on the ship, Driscoll eventually develops an infatuation with her, telling her, \\"Say... I guess I love you.\\" As Denham remarked, \\"Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face and bang - he cracks up and goes sappy.\\" Ann is at first surprised by Driscoll's interest, but the two embrace. Upon reaching the island, Ann is kidnapped by the natives and sacrificed to Kong, but Driscoll, Denham and several other crew members charge into Skull Island to rescue her. It is eventually Driscoll who saves Ann from Kong's clutches, but the ape gives chase until Denham's team captures it and sends it to New York City. Having returned to New York, Driscoll and Ann continue to work for Denham as Kong is chained to a stage and shown to live audiences. During the show, Denham gives Driscoll credit for coming to Ann's rescue, and it is revealed that Ann and Driscoll are to be married. Kong breaks free, however, and despite Driscoll's attempts to keep Ann secure by taking her to a room and trying to fight Kong after the beast reaches through the window, Ann is once again kidnapped. They are reunited after Kong dies at the end of the film. It is believed that the choice of actor Bruce Cabot to play Driscoll was in part due to his strong resemblance to popular heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey, who at the time embodied the rugged, heroic male \\"ideal\\". The choice of the similar name \\"Jack Driscoll\\" is further indication that this was in fact the case. 2005 film The original Driscoll is divided into two separate characters in the 2005 film. His duties as first mate are transferred to second mate Ben Hayes, while the character name and the function of Ann Darrow's romantic interest are given to a playwright who tries to write a screenplay for Denham, as a friend, played by Adrien Brody. This Jack Driscoll does not intend to join the expedition at all, but delivers the script to the ship before it departs. With limited time, however, Driscoll did not write nearly enough, and Denham, desperate for more, tricks him into staying on the ship as it leaves for Skull Island. Driscoll complains that he prefers the stage, but Denham retorts that \\"if you really loved it, you would have jumped.\\" As it turns out, Denham's struggling actress, Ann Darrow, had been very familiar with Driscoll's work beforehand, and admired Driscoll greatly. She is very excited to meet him, but at first the relationship is awkward (owing in part to a case of mistaken identity on Darrow's part. When writing the next part of the script with Denham, Driscoll decides to kill off the first mate. When Denham questions it, Driscoll replies, \\"That's assuming she knows who the first mate is.\\" This is a reference to the 1933 film, in which Jack Driscoll was the first mate of the Venture.) The two eventually grow closer, however, and Driscoll also reveals that he has begun writing a comedic play dedicated to Ann, as a sign that he has fallen in love with her (the dynamic from the original, in which Ann is told that women should not be on ships, is not actually said by Driscoll, but does appear in Denham's film, although as it turns out Driscoll's script had been altered by the actor, Bruce Baxter). While writing the screenplay, Driscoll is the first to learn that Denham is taking the crew to an undiscovered island. When they reach the island, Ann is kidnapped by the native inhabitants as a sacrifice for Kong, and Driscoll sets out in search for her along with the rest of the crew. He shows both great amounts of courage and a single-minded determination to find and rescue Ann. Of the original party, he is the only member who survived the journey through the island (including attacks by dinosaurs, a giant fish, and giant insects) and did not return to the settlement without rescuing Ann, managing to retrieve her by himself. Unlike the original, Driscoll did not continue with Denham or Ann after Kong was brought to New York, but rather continued with the comedy he had dedicated to Ann. Nor does Denham give Driscoll credit as being the hero of the adventure at Skull Island. Driscoll does, however, come to fear that he has let Ann slip away from him. Driscoll realizes before anyone else that Denham's opening is heading for disaster, but cannot do anything to prevent it. Discovering that Kong actually recognizes him on sight‚Äîand is hellbent on killing him for taking Ann‚ÄîDriscoll attempts to use that to draw Kong away from Times Square and away from crowds of bystanders. Driscoll is nearly killed for his heroic effort, but Ann approaches and stops Kong's rampage, saving Jack's life this time around. Jack regains consciousness and sees Kong holding Ann, climbing up the Empire State Building and manages to get through the army and get to the top. When Ann is alone on the Empire State Building after Kong has fallen, Driscoll is reunited with her and the two embrace. Real-world history With the 2005 film, the casting of Adrien Brody drew some criticism, reported by film critic Roger Ebert, because he was \\"not precisely hero material\\". Ebert defended that casting decision, saying Driscoll was just a writer who did not need \\"big muscles\\".Ebert, Roger, \\"King Kong,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, December 13, 2005. On the making of documentary, Adrien Brody commented that of all the films he had ever made, King Kong was the one for which he was most anticipating seeing the finished product.

The Root of All Evil?, later retitled The God Delusion, is a television documentary written and presented by Richard Dawkins in which he argues that humanity would be better off without religion or belief in God. The documentary was first broadcast in January 2006, in the form of two 45-minute episodes (excluding advertisement breaks), on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Dawkins did not think The Root of All Evil? was an ideal title. His book The God Delusion, published in September 2006, explores topics from the documentary in more detail. The God Delusion Pilgrims at Lourdes, a place Dawkins visits in the documentary. The God Delusion explored the unproven traditions that are given as fact by religious faiths, and the extremes that some followers take them. Dawkins argues that faith is not a way of understanding the world (described as \\"non-thought\\"), and is opposed to modern science which tests hypotheses and builds theories to describe the world. Dawkins visits the United States to interview pastor Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, and to Jerusalem to interview Yousef al-Khattab (Joseph Cohen), an American born Jew who settled in Israel before converting to Islam. Responding to charges that scientific understanding does not entitle one to reject religion, Dawkins describe's Bertrand Russell's celestial teapot thought experiment. The Virus Of Faith In The Virus Of Faith Dawkins made a more emotional appeal. The programme examined the moral framework that religions are often cited as providing, and argued against the indoctrination of children. The title of the programme comes from Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene in which Dawkins introduced the idea of the meme. DNA travels from parents to offspring in genes, but some DNA in the form of viruses can also pass between any individuals. Dawkins compares religious faith to a virus, being passed from parents to offspring and teachers to pupils. Dawkins visits a London Hasidic Jewish school, in which students are largely isolated from outside ideas. Also in London, Dawkins visits Phoenix Academy, one of the semi-independent city academies introduced by Tony Blair's government, which follows the American Accelerated Christian Learning curriculum. Dawkins finds the pupils rote learning biblical stories, which are integrated into various academic subjects. Dawkins interviews the head teacher of the school, asking why the science curriculum includes Noah's Ark and describes AIDS as the \\"wages of sin\\". When the teacher states that without God or a law-giver people will tend to do bad things, Dawkins takes this as a cue to explore the differences between secular ethics and morality based on religious law. Returning to the United States Dawkins visits the Hell-House Outreach Programme, an organisation that uses hell for \\"moral policing\\", producing videos aimed at twelve-year-olds. He also interviews Michael Bray, a friend of Paul Jennings Hill who was sentenced to death for murdering a doctor who performed abortions. Dawkins takes Bray's belief that the bible sanctions capital punishment for adultery as a cue to discuss his views that the bible, especially the Old Testament, clashes with modern secular ethics. Quoting from the Old Testament, Dawkins describes its God as \\"the most unpleasant character in all fiction,\\" and expresses similar disregard for the New Testament's \\"sadomasochistic doctrine of atonement for original sin.\\" Dawkins interviews Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford, a liberal Anglican, about why Harries accepts some of the Bible while rejecting others, including many of its moral teachings. Harries states that it is possible to be intellectually fulfilled as both a rationalist and religious person. Finally Dawkins discusses some of the ideas about morality from evolutionary biology, such as reciprocal altruism and kin selection. Production Dawkins has said that the title The Root of All Evil? was not his preferred choice, but that Channel 4 had insisted on it to create controversy.The Jeremy Vine Show, BBC Radio 2. 5 January 2006. The sole concession from the producers on the title was the addition of the question mark. Dawkins has stated that the notion of anything being the root of all evil is ridiculous.Point of Inquiry Podcast. 10 February 2006. Dawkins' book The God Delusion, released in September 2006, goes on to examine the topics raised in the documentary in greater detail. The documentary was rebroadcast on the More4 channel on 25 August 2010 under the title of The God Delusion. Critical reception Writing in the New Statesman, Dawkins stated that Channel 4's correspondence in response to the documentary had been running at two to one in favour.Richard Dawkins, 2006. \\"Diary\\". New Statesman. Journalists including Howard Jacobson had accused Dawkins of giving voice to extremists,Howard Jacobson, 2006. \\"Nothing like an unimaginative scientist to get non-believers running back to God .\\" The Independent. a claim Dawkins responded to by noting that the National Association of Evangelicals has some 30 million members, and also that he had invited the main UK religious leaders to participate, but they all declined. However, Alister McGrath, a Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University, was interviewed for the program, but was not included in the documentary.AlterNet: MediaCulture: The Dawkins Delusion McGrath claimed to have made Dawkins \\"appear uncomfortable\\" with his explanations of religious belief and the implication, made by McGrath, was that Dawkins's program showed journalistic dishonesty. In a lecture at City Church of San Francisco McGrath said that his interview was cut because he said things that did not promote the message that Dawkins and the producers wanted to get across.Open Forum The McGrath interview, together with other interviews not shown in the program \\"The Root of All Evil?\\", was released in the DVD \\"Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews\\".Root of All Evil?

In The Tablet, Keith Ward criticised Dawkins for what he considered to be an indiscriminate and simplistic approach to religion.Keith Ward, 2006. \\"Faith, hype and a lack of clarity .\\" The Tablet. Professor Keith Ward's book Is Religion Dangerous?, responding to the Dawkins programme, analyzes the claim that religion does more harm than good and suggests that \\"such assertions ... ignore the available evidence... and substitute rhetoric for analysis\\".Ward, Keith, Is Religion Dangerous? p. 8 Charlie Brooker writes for The Guardian that Dawkins' \\"central point [...] seems pretty valid from where I'm standing\\" but that Dawkins \\"quickly becomes far too angry to conduct a civil conversation\\" in interviews with religious people and this \\"doesn't exactly move the debate forward\\".

The word affect takes on a different meaning in psychology and other fields. For Spinoza, as discussed in Parts Two and Three of his Ethics, affects are states of mind and body that are related to (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings and emotions, of which he says there are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy (laetitia),Part III, Proposition 56. pain or sorrow (tristitia) and desire (cupiditas) or appetite.\\"In truth I cannot recognize any difference between human appetite and desire\\". Subsequent philosophical usage by Gilles Deleuze, F√©lix Guattari and their translator Brian Massumi, while derived explicitly from Spinoza, tends to distinguish more sharply than Spinoza does between affect and what are conventionally called emotions. Affects are difficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, \\"an affect or passion of the mind [animi pathema] is a confused idea\\" which is only perceived by the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force.Existendi vis or power of existence. The term \\"affect\\" is central to what has become known as the \\"affective turn\\" in the humanities and social sciences.  In Spinoza  In Baruch Spinoza's Ethics, Part III Definition 3, the term \\"affect\\" (affectus, traditionally translated as \\"emotion\\")Of the two \\"standard\\" English translations, the version by Samuel Shirley uses \\"emotion\\" for affectus, whereas the more recent rendering by Edwin Curley uses \\"affect\\". is the modification or variation produced in a body (including the mind) by an interaction with another body which increases or diminishes the body's power of activity (potentia agendi): :By affect I understand affections of the body by which the body's power of acting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at the same time, the ideas of these affections. Affect is thus a special case of the more neutral term \\"affection\\" (affectio), which designates the form \\"taken on\\" by some thing,Samuel Shirley, \\"Translator's Preface\\". the mode, state or quality of a body's relation to the world or nature (or infinite \\"substance\\"). In Part III, \\"Definitions of the Emotions/Affects\\", Spinoza defines 48 different forms of affect, including love and hatred, hope and fear, envy and compassion. They are nearly all manifestations of the three basic affects of: * desire (cupiditas) or appetite (appetitus), defined as \\"the very essence of man insofar as his essence is conceived as determined to any action from any given affection of itself\\"; * pleasure (laetitia), defined as \\"man's transition from a state of less perfection to a state of greater perfection\\"; and * pain or sorrow (tristitia), defined as \\"man's transition from a state of greater perfection to a state of less perfection\\". In Spinoza's view, since God's power of activity is infinite, any affection which increases the organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes in that they are vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually resist it or hold it in check.  In Bergson  Henri Bergson contends in Matter and Memory (1896) that we do not know our body only \\"from without\\" by perceptions, but also \\"from within\\" by affections (French: affections).Henri Bergson, Matter and Memory (1896), ch. 1.  In Deleuze and Guattari  The terms \\"affect\\" and \\"affection\\" came to prominence in Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia. In his notes on the terminology employed, the translator Brian Massumi gives the following definitions of the terms as used in the volume: :AFFECT/AFFECTION. Neither word denotes a personal feeling (sentiment in Deleuze and Guattari). L'affect (Spinoza's affectus) is an ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body's capacity to act. L'affection (Spinoza's affectio) is each such state considered as an encounter between the affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its broadest possible sense to include \\"mental\\" or ideal bodies). Affects, according to Deleuze, are not simple affections, as they are independent from their subject. Artists create affects and percepts, \\"blocks of space-time\\", whereas science works with functions, according to Deleuze, and philosophy creates concepts.  Affective turn  Since 1995, a number of authors in the social sciences and humanities have begun to explore affect theory as a way of understanding spheres of experience (including bodily experience) which fall outside of the dominant paradigm of representation (based on rhetoric and semiotics); this movement has been called the affective turn.Patricia Ticineto Clough, Jean Halley (eds.), The Affective Turn: Theorizing the Social, Duke University Press, 2007, p. 1; Paul Hoggett, Simon Thompson (eds.), Politics and the Emotions: The Affective Turn in Contemporary Political Studies, Bloomsbury, 2012, p. 1. Consequently, these approaches are interested in the widest possible variety of interactions and encounters, interactions and encounters that are not necessarily limited to human sensibility. The translator of Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, Canadian political philosopher Brian Massumi, has given influential definitions of affect (see above) and has written on the neglected importance of movement and sensation in cultural formations and our interaction with real and virtual worlds. Likewise, geographer Nigel Thrift has explored the role of affect in what he terms \\"non-representational theory\\". In 2010, The Affect Theory Reader was published by Melissa Gregg and Gregory J. Seigworth and has provided the first compendium of affect theory writings. Researchers such as Mog Stapleton, Daniel D. Hutto and Peter CarruthersHutto, D. Intersubjective Engagements without Theory of Mind: A Cross-Species ComparisonCarruthers, P. (2000). Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. have pointed to the need to investigate and to develop the notions of affect and emotion. They hold that these are important in the developing paradigm of embodiment in cognitive science, in consciousness studies and the philosophy of mind. This step will be necessary for cognitive science, Mog Stapleton maintains, to be \\"properly embodied\\" cognitive science.

They are called \\"implicit\\" because the position of the elements carries meaning and relationship between elements; this is contrasted with the use of pointers to give an explicit relationship between elements. Definitions of \\"low overhead\\" vary, but generally means constant overhead; in big O notation, O(1) overhead. A less restrictive definition is a succinct data structure, which allows greater overhead.  Definition  Formally, an implicit data structure is one with constant space overhead (above the information-theoretic lower bound). Historically, defined an implicit data structure (and algorithms acting on one) as one \\"in which structural information is implicit in the way data are stored, rather than explicit in pointers.\\" They are somewhat vague in the definition, defining it most strictly as a single array, with only the size retained (a single number of overhead),\\"Thus, only a simple array is needed for the data.\\", p. 236; \\"We will draw no formal distinction between a pointer and an integer (index) in the range [0, N]. A data structure is then implicit, if the only such integer which need be retained is N itself.\\", p. 238 or more loosely as a data structure with constant overhead ().\\"... one might prefer to permit a constant number of pointers to be retained and still designate the structure as implicit.\\", p. 238 This latter definition is today more standard, and the still-looser notion of a data structure with non-constant but small overhead is today known as a succinct data structure, as defined by ; it was referred to as semi-implicit by .\\"We will also suggest two structures which might be described as ‚Äúsemi-implicit,‚Äù in that a variable, but o(N), number of pointers (indices) is kept.\\", p. 238 A fundamental distinction is between static data structures (read-only) and dynamic data structures (which can be modified). Simple implicit data structures, such as representing a sorted list as an array, may be very efficient as a static data structure, but inefficient as a dynamic data structure, due to modification operations (such as insertion in the case of a sorted list) being inefficient.  Examples  A trivial example of an implicit data structure is an array data structure, which is an implicit data structure for a list, and requires only the constant overhead of the length; unlike a linked list, which has a pointer associated with each data element, which explicitly gives the relationship from one element to the next. Similarly, a null-terminated string is an implicit data structure for a string (list of characters). These are considered very simple because they are static data structures (read-only), and only admit the simple operation of iteration over the elements. Similarly simple is representing a multi- dimensional array as a single 1-dimensional array, together with its dimensions. For example, representing an m √ó n array as a single list of length m¬∑n, together with the numbers m and n (instead of as a 1-dimensional array of pointers to each 1-dimensional subarray). The elements need not be of the same type, and a table of data (a list of records) may similarly be represented implicitly as a flat (1-dimensional) list, together with the length of each field, so long as each field has uniform size (so a single size can be used per field, not per record). A less trivial example is representing a sorted list by a sorted array, which allows search in logarithmic time by binary search. Contrast with a search tree, specifically a binary search tree, which also allows logarithmic-time search, but requires pointers. A sorted array is only efficient as a static data structure, as modifying the list is slow ‚Äì unlike a binary search tree ‚Äì but does not require the space overhead of a tree. An important example of an implicit data structure is representing a perfect binary tree as a list, in increasing order of depth, so root, first left child, first right child, first left child of first left child, etc. Such a tree occurs notably for an ancestry chart to a give depth, and the implicit representation is known as an Ahnentafel (ancestor table). This can be generalized to a complete binary tree (where the last level may be incomplete), which yields the best-known example of an implicit data structure, namely the binary heap, which is an implicit data structure for a priority queue. This is more sophisticated than earlier examples because it allows multiple operations, and is an efficient dynamic data structure (it allows efficient modification of the data): not only top, but also insert and pop. More sophisticated implicit data structures include the beap (bi-parental heap).  History  The trivial examples of lists or tables of values date to prehistory, while historically non-trivial implicit data structures date at least to the Ahnentafel, which was introduced by Micha√´l Eytzinger in 1590 for use in genealogy. In formal computer science, the first implicit data structure is generally considered to be the sorted list, used for binary search, which was introduced by John Mauchly in 1946, in the Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures regarding any computer-related topic. The binary heap was introduced in to implement the heapsort. The notion of an implicit data structure was formalized in , as part of introducing and analyzing the beap.

At the age of five he moved to Serbia with his parents and spent his life in Novi Sad, where he began to paint in 1949 after his serious illness and retiring. Between two world wars he worked as a button-maker, second-hand dealer, comb-maker, shop assistant and lathe operator in various towns of former Yugoslavia. During World War II he lived in exile, in Hungary, and in 1945 he returned to Novi Sad. Feje≈° suffered from asthma and sciatica throughout his life, keeping him bed-ridden. In 1949, he discovered painting and handicrafts, and began his first works.

He had his first exhibition in 1955 and independent show in 1956. He was a protagonist of urban landscape in na√Øve art and outsider art in the South‚ÄìSlavic region. Despite his great freedom in presentation and stylization, his compositions did not exceed the domain of the explicit and the recognizable, because he took black and white postcards with monumental buildings as models, and copied them by using carbon paper, then magnified them, always adding something from his fantasy. Realistic appearance and coloring of buildings were subordinated to the artist's fancy, sometimes not the least like original. He painted the towns at the Adriatic Coast, the North Sea, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, India, etc. Defining the arches and architraves by use of frieze of dominoes, scattered buttons instead of oculi the artist showed his lucidity. With his irresistible wish to make the reality more beautiful, to make the grey colourful, he uses warm, sound and fauvist bright tints. The absence of narration, i.e. the abstract forms, coloring, inclination to the geometrical, strong rhythm and stylization in the presentation, flatness and ornamentation point to instinctively conceived modern sensibility of Emerik Feje≈°. A figure did not interest him much, but the dance of tiles, specific boogie-woogie, by which he made unique, cheerful scenery, rhapsodies of shapes and colours, behind which he used to hide, lonely, ill and fragile like a small, grey screw in the machinery of mainstream which devours everything. He lived in his own world of infantile game of colours and lines in the ambience of everlasting childhood. He was not considerably prominent during his lifetime. His art was recognized by the audience many years later. He is a world classic today.  Exhibitions  He exhibited his urban legends worldwide and many times received awards and recognition.

After finishing teacher-training college, he would teach at the poverty-stricken villages of Gilan-e-Gharb and Shah Abad (nowadays called Islam Abad). This atmosphere is featured in most of his stories. His own life situation, as well as the experiences that he had from his teaching in those poor areas, was the inspiration for his literary works and also made him a critic of the political and social situation of Iran. Later, he moved to Tehran and continued his studies in Persian literature. In 2006, Ali Ashraf Darvishian was in Australia as a guest of the Iranian Centre for Democracy and presented a number of lectures on a broad range of social and cultural issues. Marjane Satrapi, an Iranian-French author, mentions Darvishian in her graphic novel Persepolis. She considers him her favorite childhood author, recalls going to his clandestine book-signing, and describes him as \\"a kind of local Charles Dickens\\".Satrapi, Marjane. The Complete Persepolis.

Nadarad (Doesn't have) is one of the titles of the book. It is named after the family name of the main character of the story, which foreshadows absolute poverty of all the characters in the story and mostly Nadarad (meaning Doesn‚Äôt have) family. From the point of view of Marxist critical approach, one of the many perspectives through which a literary work can be analyzed, poverty can be said to have been the result of social conflict and class struggle, because of the fact that people were not aware of how they have unconsciously accepted the subservient, powerless roles in their society that have been prescribed for them by others (false consciousness). In this story, Nadarad family are the representative of the proletariat, while Mash Ghorban represents the bourgeoisie. Niaz Ali, child of family, chooses to go to school in order to promote his class in society, and he has no plan of protesting against the cruel social structure.

Her parents were named John and Lindy Eareckson. Joni was named for her father, John Eareckson, so her name is pronounced like \\"Johnny\\". Her father participated in the 1932 Olympics as an alternate for the United States wrestling team and was honored as a Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 1996. With the example of her parents, Tada lived a very active life all through her growing up years. She enjoyed riding horses, hiking, tennis, and swimming. On July 30, 1967, she dove into the Chesapeake Bay after misjudging the shallowness of the water. She suffered a fracture between the fourth and fifth cervical levels and became a quadriplegic (or tetraplegic), paralyzed from the shoulders down. During Tada's two years of rehabilitation, according to her autobiography Joni, she experienced anger, depression, suicidal thoughts, and religious doubts. However, during occupational therapy, she learned to paint with a brush between her teeth and began selling her artwork. She also writes this way, although for most writing tasks she relies on voice recognition software. To date, she has written over forty books, recorded several musical albums, starred in an autobiographical movie of her life, and is an advocate for people with disabilities. Tada wrote of her experiences in her 1976 international best-selling autobiography, Joni: The unforgettable story of a young woman's struggle against quadriplegia & depression, which has been distributed in many languages. The book was made into a 1979 feature film of the same name, starring herself. Her second book, A Step Further, was released in 1978. Ministry and public life Tada founded Joni and Friends in 1979, an organization to \\"accelerate Christian ministry in the disability community\\" throughout the world. In 2007 the Joni and Friends International Disability Center in Agoura Hills, California, was established. Led by Tada (founder and CEO) and John Nugent (president and COO), the Joni and Friends International Disability Center runs a multi-faceted non-profit covering a number of program outlets. The longest running program is \\"Joni and Friends Radio\\", a five- minute radio program begun in 1982. It now runs four minutes in length and can be heard each weekday on over 1,000 broadcast outlets. Tada also records a one-minute radio broadcast \\"Diamonds in the Dust\\" that airs daily. Both programs have received awards: \\"Joni and Friends Radio\\" received the \\"Radio Program of the Year\\" award from National Religious Broadcasters in 2002 and \\"Diamonds in the Dust\\" won the same award in 2011 in the short program. Other Joni and Friends programs include Family Retreats (a camp/retreat experience for families affected by disability), Wounded Warrior Getaways (which offer a similar experience for families of Wounded Warriors), and Wheels for the World (collects manual wheelchairs and other mobility devices which are refurbished by volunteers in prison restoration shops then shipped overseas where the wheelchairs are fitted by physical therapists to people in developing nations). Joni and Friends also has produced 51 episodes of Joni and Friends TV, overseen the formation of the Christian Institute on Disability (a training and advocacy arm of Joni and Friends), among other ventures. While the main office of Joni and Friends still resides in Agoura Hills, California, smaller offices can be found across the United States. In 2005, Tada was appointed to the Disability Advisory Committee of the U.S. State Department. Tada served on the National Council on Disability under Presidents Reagan and Bush in 1988. The Americans with Disabilities Act's first draft was authored by this council. Tada is a conference speaker. Her articles have been published in Christianity Today, Today's Christian Woman, The War Cry (Salvation Army), and newspapers around the world. Tada has appeared several times on Larry King Live. In 1989, Tada was a plenary speaker at the Second International Congress on World Evangelization in Manila. Also, in her appointment as the Lausanne Senior Associate for Disability Concerns, she served until 2013. As of 2017, Tada is still a board member of the Lausanne Movement. Joni sang \\"Alone Yet Not Alone\\" (music by Bruce Broughton, lyrics by Dennis Spiegel) for the film of the same name, which was nominated for Oscar in the Original Song category, but the Academy's board of governors voted to rescind the nomination. With limited lung capacity due to her disability, Tada, had her husband, Ken, pushing on her diaphragm while she recorded the song to give her enough breath to hit the high notes. Tada has no professional training in music. As of 2017, Tada is an adviser on many organizations, such as the Board of Reference for the Christian Medical and Dental Society, Young Life Capernaum Board, CBM International, National Institute for Learning Disabilities, and the American Leprosy Mission. She also served on Love and Action, Institute on Learning Disabilities, Disability Advisory Committee, New Europe Communications, Christian Writers Guild and honorary co-chair on the Presidential Prayer Team. She has been interviewed in the Chicago Tribune., Ligonier Ministries, and the Los Angeles Times. In November 2009, Tada signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox Christians to work towards changing laws which permit abortion, and other matters that go against their religious consciences.

For many years, Ken was a high school history teacher and coach, though he is now retired. Ken is sansei, meaning that he is the third generation to be born in the United States after his family relocated from Japan. Ken and Joni live in Calabasas, California. In 2010, Tada announced that she had been diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy.

During his career, he was widely considered the best pitcher in the Negro Leagues at the time, and led the Grays to eight pennants in one nine- year span. He was also considered a very good pinch hitter and a solid bat. In February 2006, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Biography Born in Alger, Ohio, he had a large variety of pitches in his arsenal, including a sinker, a slider, and even a knuckleball, but his best pitch was his curveball. Brown would fire the curveball at a batter no matter what the count was, having supreme confidence in that pitch. Brown played for Cum Posey's Homestead Grays from 1932 to 1945. Brown married Posey's daughter, Ethel. In 1944, he went 9‚Äì3 for the champion Grays, and threw a one-hit shutout in the Negro World Series to put them on top of the African-American baseball world. In 1945, he threw a seven-inning perfect game. After his long stint with the Grays, he opted to play in Mexico and in the Canadian Provincial League in his final years. In those years, he continued to dominate most batters, leading Sherbrooke to a title in the Provincial League. He also pitched a no-hitter for Santa Clara of the Cuban Winter League, a baseball sanctuary, at that time, for many black players during the winter season. Brown also helped them to the Cuban title that year (1936). In the Negro League version of the All- Star Game, the East-West All-Star Game, Brown got the start in 1935. The records that were taken show an excellent 109‚Äì30 (.762 winning percentage) record by the end of Brown's career. It made him fifth in the league's all- time win list. Like most great Negro Leaguers, Brown managed as well later on in his career. He was one of five black players mentioned as being of major league caliber in a 1938 wire sent to the Pittsburgh Pirates by the Pittsburgh Courier. The other four were Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Cool Papa Bell and Satchel Paige. Brown died at age 56 in Dayton, Ohio. He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his \\"significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C\\" as part of the Homestead Grays on August 10, 2010.

The new club took over the fixtures of the recently defunct Braintree F.C. in the North Essex League, and also took on most of the former club's players.Blakeman, M (2010) The Official History of the Eastern Counties Football League 1935‚Äì2010, Volume II They left the league in 1900, but returned in 1901.

In 1921 they were renamed Crittall Athletic to be more closely identified with their parent company. After winning Division Two (Western) in 1922‚Äì23 and 1923‚Äì24,2016-2017 Official Handbook Essex & Suffolk Border League they were promoted to the Senior Division of the Border League in 1925. In 1928 they joined the Spartan League, and in 1935 were founder members of the Eastern Counties League, although they also continued to play in the Border League. They won the Border League in 1935‚Äì36 and both the Border League and the Eastern Counties League in 1936‚Äì37, but then left the Eastern Counties League to join the newly established Essex County League. The new league folded after a single season (in which Crittall were runners-up) and the club returned to the Eastern Counties League. After World War II the Eastern Counties League did not resume in 1945, so Crittall joined the Eastern Division of the London League instead. After finishing second in their first season, they were promoted to the Premier Division. They were invited to rejoin the Eastern Counties League in 1947, but turned the offer down and remained in the London League, where they won the League Cup twice before returning to the Eastern Counties League in 1952. In 1954 they turned professional, but financial problems forced them to revert to amateur status and drop back down into the Border League at the end of the 1954‚Äì55 season. In 1959‚Äì60 they won the league and League Cup double. They switched to the Greater London League in 1964, and then to the Metropolitan League in 1966. They were renamed Braintree & Crittall Athletic in 1968, and after winning the League Cup in 1969‚Äì70, the club returned to the Eastern Counties League again. In 1981 all links with Crittall were severed and the club was renamed Braintree F.C., before adopting their current name a year later.Iron 2018: The Braintree Town Football Club Annual, Queensway Publishing, 2017, p13 They won their second Eastern Counties League title in 1983‚Äì84 and retained it the following season. In 1986‚Äì87 they won the Essex Senior Trophy and the following season they won the League Cup. In 1991 Braintree moved up to the Southern Division of the Southern League. In 1996 the club asked the FA to switch leagues to reduce their travelling. After initially being refused, they were allowed to move to Division Three of the Isthmian League, although it was an effective drop of two divisions. They were promoted as runners-up in their first season, and repeated the feat the following season. After three seasons in Division One they were promoted to the Premier Division with a third-place finish in 2000‚Äì01. They won the Premier Division in 2005‚Äì06 to earn promotion to the Conference South. The season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, eventually losing 4‚Äì1 at Shrewsbury Town. Braintree qualified for the promotion play-offs in their first season in the Conference South, but lost 1‚Äì0 to Salisbury City in the final. They also reached the play-offs the following season, but lost to Eastbourne Borough in the semi- finals. In 2010‚Äì11 they finished as Conference South champions, earning promotion to the Conference Premier. The next four seasons saw the club reach the FA Cup for the first round, losing to Tranmere Rovers, Newport County, Chesterfield and Oxford United in successive seasons. In 2015‚Äì16 they finished third in the renamed National League, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. Despite winning the first leg at Grimsby Town 1‚Äì0, they lost the home leg 2‚Äì0 after extra time.Braintree 0-2 Grimsby (agg 1-2, aet) BBC Sport, 8 May 2016 In 2016‚Äì17 the club reached the second round of the FA Cup for the first time after beating Eastbourne Borough in the first round; they eventually lost 5‚Äì2 to Millwall in the second round.

In the play- offs they defeated Hemel Hempstead Town and Dartford to reach the final, in which they beat Hampton & Richmond Borough 4‚Äì3 on penalties to earn promotion back to the National League. However, they were relegated to the National League South the following season after finishing second-from-bottom of the National League. =Reserve team= Braintree Town reserves joined Division One of the Eastern Counties League in 2012, remaining in the league until the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. Ground After being founded, Manor Works initially played at the Fair Field, now the site of the town hall, library and bus station. They moved to Spaldings Meadow in Panfield Lane in 1903. In 1923 the club moved to a new ground on Cressing Road which had been built by their parent company. Due to problems with the pitch in 1975, the club were forced to play matches at several other venues, including Heybridge Swifts' Scraley Road (a single match on 26 April arranged at such short notice that many fans arrived at Cressing Road for the match and only 50 attended the game), Braintree Rugby Club's Tabor Avenue (at the start of the 1975‚Äì76 season) and the Courtaulds Sports Ground in Church Street in Bocking (a single match against Gorleston on 6 September 1975 with a crowd of 73).

Both the abbey and the town that grew up around it, are named after the Tegernsee, the lake on the shores of which they are located. The name is from the Old High German tegarin seo, meaning great lake. Tegernsee Abbey, officially known as St. Quirinus Abbey for its patron saint St. Quirinus, was first built in the 8th century. Until 1803, it was the most important Benedictine community in Bavaria. Today, the monastery buildings are known as Schloss Tegernsee (Tegernsee Castle) and are in the possession of the Wittelsbach family. The local Catholic parish church of Saint Quirinus is in the former abbey church. The former abbey premises also accommodate the well-known brewery Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee, brew pub, restaurant and the Tegernsee Grammar School (Gymnasium Tegernsee). History =Foundation and early history= The monastic community at Tegernsee was founded in the mid-8th century (either in 746 or around 765). It was settled by monks from St. Gall and dedicated to Saint Quirinus of Rome, whose relics were brought here from Rome in 804. Soon the monastery spread the message of Christianity as far as the Tyrol and Lower Austria. The founders were the brothers Otkar (or Otocar), and Adalbert, members of one of the ancient noble clans of Bavaria, although it is not certain exactly which family they were from. There is little definite information on the early days of the monastery as a result of a fire in about 970, which destroyed earlier evidence. However, a well-known and detailed (but nevertheless entirely unverifiable) tradition about the foundation has developed. According to this tradition, Otkar and Adelbert were princes of the Huosi. They were kin of the Bavarian ruling house of the Agilolfinger, whose principal territory was the area now known as the Huosigau in south-west Bavaria, although they had many other lands elsewhere in Bavaria and in Burgundy. They and their families lived at the court of Pippin the Younger, King of the Franks (714-768), whose son fell into a rage during a game of chess and killed the son of Otkar with the chessboard. Pippin, fearing the revenge of such a powerful family, he summoned Otkar and Adalbert before they could hear of the killing, and asked them for their advice: \\"How would you deal with a terrible evil if there were no way to change it?\\" The brothers replied: \\"All one could do in such a case would be to accept the evil with humility and submission to the will of God.\\" Only then did Pippin tell them of the death of Otkar's son. The brothers, bound by their own judgment, were unable to take up arms and found themselves forced to accept the murder. Instead, they decided to turn their backs on the world. They returned to their homeland in the south of Bavaria and founded a monastery on an unusually beautiful site by the shores of the Tegernsee, into which they withdrew. For many centuries a large panel in the nearby church of Egern depicted the scene of the princes playing chess. After the fall of Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria (748-788), Tegernsee became a Carolingian Empire royal monastery during the Carolingian Renaissance. The community was greatly weakened by Hungarian raids and by repeated attempts at secularisation during the reign of Arnulf I, Duke of Bavaria (907-937) and in the course of the 10th century suffered a sustained decline, culminating in the fire of around 970. =Middle Ages= Restored and re-founded, however, under Emperor Otto II (973-983) as an Imperial Abbey in 978, and re-settled by monks from St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier, Tegernsee entered a new period of growth. With the activities of the monk Froumund (1006-1012) and Abbot Ellinger (1017-1026 and 1031-1041), the abbey became a centre of literature, manuscript production and learning, and was also active in the resettlement of other Benedictine houses in Bavaria, including the newly founded abbey of Saints Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg in c. 1012. This golden age of the abbey lasted almost to the end of the 12th century. Among the literary and scientific works produced at that time were: \\"Ruodlieb\\" (considered the first German novel; last third of the 11th century); the Quirinals (12th century); \\"Play about the Antichrist\\" (1155?); and the Tegernsee Letter Collection (1178 to 1186). The well-known Tegernseespruch of Walther von der Vogelweide dates either from a little before 1206 or from c. 1212, and thus belongs, not to this period, but to the beginning of the period of decline that followed. Tegernsee was largely spared the political and ecclesiastical confusions arising from the conflict between Pope Alexander III (1159-1177) and Emperor Frederick I \\"Barbarossa,\\" Holy Roman Emperor, and even managed to acquire substantial privileges from both pope and emperor. However, despite those privileges and its early status as an imperial abbey, Tegernsee lost that status as it was never able to effectively enjoy Imperial immediacy. Therefore, it remained subordinate to Bavaria throughout its existence. The shape of the future was made plain with the appointment of Abbot Manegold of Berg, son of the Count of Berg, to this Bavarian abbey in 1189, as the result of political intrigue by the Counts of Andechs, V√∂gte (lords protectors) of Tegernsee, and Bishop Otto of Freising. The political and economic interests of the noble families of Berg, Andechs and Hohenstaufen, now came to dominate the abbey and as a result, it declined during the 13th and 14th centuries into little more than a private monastery dependent on a small number of noble families. To make matters worse, it burnt down in 1410. =Later history to dissolution= However, in 1426, Tegernsee received a Visitation from the Vicar-General, Johannes Gr√ºnwalder, which marked a new beginning. Over the next decades, with the support of the Papal Legate Cardinal Nikolaus von Kues, it became a focus of the Reforms of Melk Abbey, which opened Benedictine houses hitherto restricted to the nobility to a wider range of social classes. In 1455, monks of Tegernsee settled Andechs Abbey and were appointed abbots at Benediktbeuern, Oberalteich, Wessobrunn and others. In 1446, a Passion altar was dedicated. Johannes Keck (who was the Tegernsee delegate at the Council of Basle and died in 1450) wrote a work on music, and the Prior of Tegernsee, Bernhard von Waging (d. 1472) composed his mystical writings, including a defense of Cusanus' writings on \\"learned ignorance.\\" This second flowering continued into the Early Modern period. From 1573, the monastery had its own printing press, which thanks to Imperial privileges was allowed to print many books on theology, liturgy and the theory of music. The community survived the confusion of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), when the abbey was raided by Swedish soldiers. Tegernsee Abbey was also a prominent member of the Benedictine Bavarian Congregation, established in 1684. =Architecture= The former Carolingian style abbey church built at the end of the 10th century had been converted in the 11th to a Romanesque basilica, which in its turn had been re-fashioned between 1455 and 1460 into a Gothic church. The monastic buildings and the church were refurbished in the Baroque style between 1684 and 1688. =Secularisation= During the abbacy of Abbot Benedikt Schwarz (to 1787), the first signs began to show of the secularisation which eventually took place on 17 March 1803, thus bringing the abbey to an end. Gregor Rottenkolber, the last Abbot of Tegernsee, died on 13 February 1810. The greater part of the site was bought by Baron Drechsel for his brewery, but he later sold a small part back to an unofficial monastic community, which remained until 1861. The buildings of the monastery itself were acquired in 1817 by king Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and later became a possession of the Dukes in Bavaria (a side branch of the ruling Wittelsbach family, the kings of Bavaria), attracted by the unusually beautiful location, and turned it into their summer residence.

He owned property in the Don River valley and was an advocate for the valley's preservation. As a member of the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, he was responsible for much of the Don Valley's conservation. A section of the valley is a conservation reserve named in his honour and four other locations in Canada are named in his honour. Early life Charles Sauriol was born in Toronto, Ontario. He was the youngest of seven children. His father, Joseph Sauriol, had moved to Toronto in 1882 to work on a project that involved straightening the lower portion of the Don River. Charles was an eighth-generation Canadian. An ancestor of his had emigrated to New France from Brittany in 1705. During his boyhood he camped out in the Don Valley with the 45th East Toronto Troop of the Boy Scouts. At this time the Don was mostly woods and farmland that remained mostly in its natural state. It was during these trips that he fell in love with the outdoors and especially the Don. This inspired his commitment to help protect the Don Valley for future generations. Sauriol was fluently bilingual. He worked for 30 years as an advertising manager for French language publishing companies such as Poirier Bessette and Le Samedi. Sauriol married Simonne Menard (1911-July 22, 2005) in 1931. They raised four children ‚Äì three daughters Denise, Monique, Marcelle and one son, Claude. Conservation activities In 1946, he was co-founder of the Don Valley Conservation Association (DVCA) whose mission was to preserve the Don Valley as a woodland park. Sauriol edited and published the DVCA newsletter called The Cardinal from 1951‚Äì1956. The Association organized steam locomotive trips for the DVCA called The Conservation Special as fundraisers from 1951‚Äì1961. These trips began at the Don River station near Queen St. in the Don Valley. These excursions attracted upwards of 1000 people and traveled to such destinations as Cobourg, Lindsay, and Niagara Falls. In 1957, he joined the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) (known today as the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority). Sauriol served on the MTRCA's executive committee and as chairman of the Conservation Areas Advisory Board. It was during the 1950s and 1960s that MTRCA was responsible for acquiring most of the valley and ravine lands in the Toronto area. This was a direct result of the damage caused by Hurricane Hazel. During his tenure he was responsible for acquiring land to create conservation areas in the Toronto area. His notable acquisitions included Bruce's Mill, Claremont, Glen Haffy, Cold Creek, and Black Creek Pioneer Village. In 1966 Sauriol joined the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC), which had been established in 1962. He worked as administrative director and assisted the NCC in acquiring natural areas. In 1971, he left the MTRCA to work for the NCC. In 1982, he became executive director of the Conservancy, until his retirement in 1987. During his time with the NCC, he was responsible for raising funds and acquiring natural areas across Canada. He helped acquire 500 properties in Ontario alone. After leaving NCC, he co-founded another organization called Trees for Today and Tomorrow which planted trees to restore degraded areas. He continued working as a consultant, lending his expertise to conservation authorities throughout Ontario with land acquisitions. Sauriol and the Don Plaque commemorating creation of Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve In 1927 he purchased a 40 hectare property at the Forks of the Don. He used this as a cottage and every year moved his family to stay there during the summer months. Part of the land was expropriated in 1958 to build the Don Valley Parkway. In 1968, the MTRCA expropriated the rest of his property as part of a larger program to acquire most of the private property in the Don Valley. While his conservation work frequently took him outside Toronto, his original love was the Don Valley. Most of his weekends were spent walking along trails in the valley. He frequently visited his property during the winter which he used as a retreat to write in his journal or create articles for the Cardinal. He wrote four books about the history of the Don. One book, Remembering the Don, is actually a collection of articles from The Cardinal. In 1989, in appreciation for his conservation work and especially his advocacy for the Don, a section of the Don Valley along the East Branch of the Don River from the forks up to Lawrence Avenue East was named the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve. In 1991 he helped to found the Todmorden Mills Wildflower Preserve which still maintains a small forested area in the Lower Don. Accolades and legacy His life work as a conservationist was recognized by many. Known as Mr. Conservation he was made a Member of the Order of Canada on April 12, 1989. He received 40 other awards and citations including the Governor General's Conservation Award in 1980 and the Parks Canada Heritage Award in 1991. Not only was Sauriol an experienced outdoorsman he also had the knack for fundraising. During his career he raised over $20 million to preserve natural areas. His legacy of preserving natural areas will be enjoyed by Canadians for many generations. In addition to the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve four other natural areas have been named for him: the Charles Sauriol Conservation Area on the Credit River, the John M. Cape/Charles Sauriol Biological Studies Area at the Lake Opinicon site of Queen's University, the Charles Sauriol Parkette in the former Borough of East York, and the Charles Sauriol Carolinian Forest in Norfolk County. Starting in 1995, the MTRCA and the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust host the Charles Sauriol Environmental Dinner, an annual fundraising event. The school board Conseil scolaire Viamonde has named an elementary school in his honour. Sauriol died of natural causes in 1995 at the age of 91.

This CD was produced as a round disc and automatically cut to shape using a computer-aided machine with a rotary tool. It is easy to distinguish that the data track of the disc is smaller compared to a full 72-minute disc; it ends before it reaches the outside border of the disc to allow the unused media on the outside to be cut away. A shaped Compact Disc is a non-circular compact disc. Examples include business card CDs, CDs in the shape of a star, a map of a country, interview material and more. These disks are usually made for marketing purposes and are properly read by most CD-ROM drives (and audio CD players, although custom-shaped CDs tend to contain less data). There are many companies that sell CDs with custom shapes. Unlike Mini CDs, which are smaller, but still circular versions of normal CDs, custom CDs can be any number of shapes, even more complicated shapes like gears with dozens of teeth, but are generally smooth and with rounded edges, such as ovals or rounded rectangles. A logo can be printed on a shaped CD, in the same way common audio CDs and CD-ROMs are labeled. Shaped CDs are produced in one of two ways. A special mold can be made and used to \\"stamp\\" CDs (or DVDs) as part of the precision injection molding process that is used to make CDs and DVDs. Because of the initial cost involved in setting up this process, it is usually used for mass production. For the same reason, this is generally restricted to the production of read-only CDs and DVDs (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM). Recordable CDs and DVDs (CD-R or DVD-R or DVD+R) are not generally available except in standard shapes including rectangular. The second method to produce a shaped CD or DVD is to produce a normal CD-ROM or DVD-ROM and cut it to the desired shape. This method works only for CD-ROM. It will not work for CD-R because the plastic used to produce CD-R tends to splinter when cut. It is important that two criteria be met for a shaped disk to function properly. First, the shape must be balanced to avoid problems when it begins to spin. Second, at least three points of the outer edge must touch either the outer 12 cm diameter rim of the player's tray where standard size discs fit or the inner rim where 8 cm diameter mini discs fit. Data can only be recorded on sections of a Shaped CD that form uninterrupted circular tracks. Other parts of the shape are purely decorative - but are still often finished to the same appearance as a CD. They appear silver and reflective on the data side of the CD, even though they contain no actual valid bytes and cannot be read. History The Flaming Lips released a CD single entitled \\"This Here Giraffe\\" on the world's first-ever star-shaped CD. It was in the shape of an 8-pointed star.The Flaming Lips, This Here Giraffe ‚Äî Star-shaped CD label The North American release of the soundtrack to the Nintendo 64 game Yoshi's Story, titled \\"Music to Pound the Ground To\\", is also a shaped CD. In this instance, the shape is an outline of the print on the disc, Yoshi's face and some fruit in the background. The North American soundtrack of Diddy Kong Racing, another Nintendo 64 game, has a similarly-shaped CD, being shaped to outline Diddy Kong's head. An additional example is the live EP Alive in Torment released by symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir. The disc is shaped like a skull. British death metal band Carcass released a limited edition of Swansong as a brain-shaped CD. One shape of business-card CD. Compatibility Shaped CDs are not compatible with all CD players. They work with most machines where the disc is inserted by manually clipping it onto a spindle (the mechanism in virtually all portable CD players), but may not work in drives that load the disc from a tray and they are not compatible with any slot-loading drives. They can even get stuck in these players or be rejected if the tray-loading mechanism has optical sensors to detect the disc position. Business card CDs or shaped CDs can hold any type of data and can usually store anywhere from 40MB to 100MB of information. These CDs may be used for promotional pieces for business, music or many other uses. Asymmetric discs Irregularly shaped, non-rotationally-symmetric discs with an offset center of mass may also cause damaging vibration if played in computer CD drives, which can operate at a much higher rotational velocity than stand-alone audio CD players. Some irregularly shaped discs work with tray-loading CD drives if they include a circular ridge on their underside that centers them on the part of the tray designed to hold 80 mm CDs, if the tray has such a feature. Legal/patent A patent exists on the production of all non-round CDs.Google Patent Database ‚Äî Patent US 5844757 Often referred to as the \\"Rose Patent,\\" the holder of this patent has litigated to collect royalties on the production or sale of any non-round disc. Other manufacturers of non-round discs have litigated to dispute the validity of this patent and have produced examples of non-round discs that predate the patent. The matter is currently in litigation. Observation of the aforementioned patent has determined that it is only in regards to magnetic media and further citations may be needed to verify its application to CD optical media.

They were built by St. Louis Car Company in 1941. Each set carried two numbers, 801-802 and 803-804.  Operation  Each set is made up of two end coaches and two center coaches. The sections are articulated using Jacobs bogies. Each end coach is divided at the side doors into a Luxury Coach, which seats 30, and a Smoking Coach, which seats 10 and also has a restroom. Each door had steps and a trap door for boarding from street level, low-level and high-level platforms. One center coach seats 40, and the other is a Tavern Lounge that seats 26. All cars are air-conditioned, a first among new traction (interurban and trolley) equipment of the time. The sets were designed to operate with the high platforms, sharp curves, and narrow clearances of the Chicago Loop and the Chicago 'L', to run at speeds of or more on the North Shore's main line, and to use city streets to the downtown Milwaukee Terminal. The sets' styling resembled that of the Pioneer Zephyr and influenced the styling of other electric trainsets, notably the Odaky≈´ 3000 series SE Romance Cars. The articulated truck/bogie design allowed very smooth running with none of the horizontal movement characteristic of non-articulated equipment. Although they were streamlined, the sets were not permitted to run faster than conventional North Shore equipment. From the front passenger seat adjacent to the motorman's half cab, if the door was propped open, a passenger could see the speedometer pegged at 90 mph on the long stretch between Dempster Street and North Chicago Junction. When the sets were received in 1941, during one test run the traction motors were allowed full field shunt to determine absolute maximum speed. It reached just over , but at that speed the train reached highway crossings before the crossing gates fully closed, a dangerous situation. Thereafter, the sets were limited to .  History  The North Shore was struggling financially in 1940 and was on the edge of bankruptcy. The effects of the Great Depression were still being felt, plus it had almost side-by-side competition from the Chicago and North Western Railroad and the nearby Milwaukee Road. All of its operating equipment had been constructed in the 1920s and exhibited wear. But it offered convenient stops around the Loop on the Chicago 'L', to which it ran from the Chicago-Evanston city boundary. The North Shore's unionized work force was concerned about job losses if the line closed, so when company management approached them with a proposal to purchase new streamliners to invigorate passenger service, employees agreed to a reduction in pay. The sets were designed by the St Louis Car Company and North Shore's engineering staff. When they arrived in 1941, they were well received by the public, although the nation's economy was beginning to improve. Earnings increased, older equipment was refurbished for appearance and comfort, and the North Shore changed from a typical mid-western interurban to a high-speed regional commuter railroad, running at high speed between two major cities. In the 1960s, competition from freeways eroded ridership, income dropped, maintenance and operating costs climbed, and the line was abandoned in January 1963. = Liberty Liners = A Liberty liner in the 1970s After the North Shore ceased operations, the sets were sold to the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, known as the Red Arrow Lines, and renamed Liberty Liners. The trolley poles and steps were removed, new doors were added in the center coach sections, and updated third-rail contact shoes were installed to operate on the Norristown High Speed Line, which uses third rail and high- level platforms between Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Norristown. The tavern- lounges continued in service, providing coffee and pastry in the morning, and beverages and snacks in the evening. 801-802 was named \\"Valley Forge\\", while 803-804 became \\"Independence Hall\\". They were retired in 1978.  Preservation  801-802 is currently being restored to its early 1960s operating condition at the Illinois Railway Museum (IRM) in Union, Illinois.

One form of legal writing involves drafting a balanced analysis of a legal problem or issue. Another form of legal writing is persuasive, and advocates in favor of a legal position. Another form legal writing involves drafting legal instruments, such as contracts and wills. Distinguishing features = Authority = Legal writing places heavy reliance on authority. In most legal writing, the writer must back up assertions and statements with citations of authority. This is accomplished by a unique and complicated citation system, unlike that used in any other genre of writing. The standard methods for American legal citation are defined by two competing rule books: the ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation and The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. Different methods may be used within the United States and in other nations. = Precedent = Legal writing values precedent, as distinct from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms. = Vocabulary = Legal writing extensively uses technical terminology that can be categorised in four ways: # Specialized words and phrases unique to law, e.g., tort, fee simple, and novation. # Ordinary words having different meanings in law, e.g., action (lawsuit), consideration (support for a promise), execute (to sign to effect), and party (a principal in a lawsuit). # Archaic vocabulary: legal writing employs many old words and phrases that were formerly quotidian language, but today exist mostly or only in law, dating from the 16th century; English examples are herein, hereto, hereby, heretofore, herewith, whereby, and wherefore (pronominal adverbs); said and such (as adjectives). # Loan words and phrases from other languages: In English, this includes terms derived from French (estoppel, laches, and voir dire) and Latin (certiorari, habeas corpus, prima facie, inter alia, mens rea, sub judice) and are not italicised as English legal language, as would be foreign words in mainstream English writing. = Formality = These features tend to make legal writing formal. This formality can take the form of long sentences, complex constructions, archaic and hyper-formal vocabulary, and a focus on content to the exclusion of reader needs. Some of this formality in legal writing is necessary and desirable, given the importance of some legal documents and the seriousness of the circumstances in which some legal documents are used. Yet not all formality in legal writing is justified. To the extent that formality produces opacity and imprecision, it is undesirable. To the extent that formality hinders reader comprehension, it is less desirable. In particular, when legal content must be conveyed to nonlawyers, formality should give way to clear communication. What is crucial in setting the level of formality in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style‚Äîthis shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal‚Äîthough not colloquial‚Äîbecause it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating the status of a legal matter, is appropriately informal. Transaction documents‚Äîlegal drafting‚Äîfall on a similar continuum. A 150-page merger agreement between two large corporations, in which both sides are represented by counsel, will be highly formal‚Äîand should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A commercial lease for a small company using a small office space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a proxy statement allowing the members of a neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be. If informality aids that goal, it is justified. Many U.S. law schools teach legal writing in a way that acknowledges the technical complexity inherent in law and the justified formality that complexity often requires, but with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and directness. Yet many practicing lawyers, busy as they are with deadlines and heavy workloads, often resort to a template-based, outdated, hyperformal writing style in both analytical and transactional documents. This is understandable, but it sometimes unfortunately perpetuates an unnecessarily formal legal writing style. Recently a variety of tools have been produced to allow writers to automate core parts of legal writing. For example, automated tools may be used by transactional lawyers to check certain formalities while writing, and tools exist to help litigators verify citations and quotations to legal authority for motions and briefs. Categories Legal writing is of two, broad categories: (i) legal analysis and (ii) legal drafting. Legal analysis is two- fold: (1) predictive analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the United States, in most law schools students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) of a given action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion. =Predictive legal analysis= The legal memorandum is the most common type of predictive legal analysis; it may include the client letter or legal opinion. The legal memorandum predicts the outcome of a legal question by analyzing the authorities governing the question and the relevant facts that gave rise to the legal question. It explains and applies the authorities in predicting an outcome, and ends with advice and recommendations. The legal memorandum also serves as record of the research done for a given legal question. Traditionally, and to meet the legal reader's expectations, it is formally organized and written. =Persuasive legal analysis= The persuasive document, a motion or a brief, attempts to persuade a deciding authority to favorably decide the dispute for the author's client. Motions and briefs are usually submitted to judges, but also to mediators, arbitrators, and others. In addition a persuasive letter may attempt to persuade the dispute's opposing party. Persuasive writing is the most rhetorically stylized. So although a brief states the legal issues, describes authorities, and applies authorities to the question‚Äîas does a memorandum‚Äîthe brief's application portion is framed as an argument. The author argues for one approach to resolving the legal matter and does not present a neutral analysis. =Legal drafting= Legal drafting creates binding legal text. It includes enacted law like statutes, rule and regulations; contracts (private and public); personal legal documents like wills and trusts; and public legal documents like notices and instructions. Legal drafting requires no legal authority citation and generally is written without a stylised voice. Plagiarism In writing an objective analysis or a persuasive document, including a memorandum or brief, lawyers write under the same plagiarism rules applicable to most other writers, with additional ethical implications for presenting copied materials as original. Legal memoranda and briefs must properly attribute quotations and source authorities; yet, within a law office, a lawyer might borrow from other lawyers' texts without attribution, in using a well-phrased, successful argument made in a previous brief. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited in academic work, especially in law review articles, seminar papers, and similar writings intended to reflect the author's original thoughts. The drafting of legal documents such as contracts is different as, unlike in most other legal writing categories, it is common to use language and clauses that are derived from form books, legal opinions and other documents without attribution. Lawyers use forms documents when drafting documents such as contracts, wills, and judgments. The key difference between using phrases or paragraphs from other legal documents, and copying in other contexts or copying the entire document, arises from the fact that lawyers are effectively drawing upon a common pool of clauses that they adjust and modify for their own purposes.  Plain language movement  The Plain Language Movement in legal writing involves an effort to avoid complex language and terminology in legal documents, to make legal writing more understandable and accessible. One of the goals of the movement is to reduce reliance on terms of art, words that have a specific meaning within the context of the law, but that may carry a different meaning in other contexts. =Legalese= Legalese is an English term first used in 1914 for legal writing that is very difficult for laymen to read and understand, the implication being that this abstruseness is deliberate for excluding the legally untrained and to justify high fees. Legalese, as a term, has been adopted in other languages.See, e.g., Legalese is characterized by long sentences, many modifying clauses, complex vocabulary, high abstraction, and insensitivity to the layman's need to understand the document's gist. Legalese arises most commonly in legal drafting, yet appears in both types of legal analysis. Some important points in the debate of \\"legalese\\" v. \\"plain language\\" as the continued standard for legal writing include: * Public comprehensibility: Perhaps most obviously, legalese suffers from being less comprehensible to the general public than plain English, which can be particularly important in both private (e.g., contracts) and public matters (e.g., laws, especially in democracies where the populace is seen as both responsible for and subject to the laws). * Resistance to ambiguity: Legalese may be particularly resistant to misinterpretation, be it incidental or deliberate, for two reasons: #Its long history of use provides a similarly extensive background of precedent tied to the language. This precedent, as discussed above, will be a strong determinant of how documents written in legalese will be interpreted. #The legalese language itself may be more precise when compared to plain English, having arisen from a need for such precision, among other things. * Coverage of contingencies: Legal writing faces a trade off in attempting to cover all possible contingencies while remaining reasonably brief. Legalese is characterized by a shift in priority towards the former of these concerns. For example, legalese commonly uses doublets and triplets of words (e.g., \\"null and void\\" and \\"dispute, controversy, or claim\\") which may appear redundant or unnecessary to laymen, but to a lawyer might reflect an important reference to distinct legal concepts. Plain-English advocates suggest that no document can possibly cover every contingency, and that lawyers should not attempt to encompass every contingency they can foresee. Rather, lawyers should only draft for the known, possible, reasonably expected contingencies.  See also  * Business speak * Plain English * Plain language * Walter F.

Lea Marston is close to the county boundary with Birmingham and about east of Sutton Coldfield. Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records that Robert Despenser held estates of nine hides at \\"Merston\\" and one hide at \\"Leth\\".Salzman, 1947, pages 114-116 By 1235 Robert Marmion of Tamworth Castle held Marston and by 1253 the de la Launde family held Lea. By the early part of the 16th century the two manors were referred to together and were generally held together. The Adderley family acquired Lea Marston in the first half of the 17th century when Charles Adderley married Anne Arden of Park Hall in Castle Bromwich. It descended in the family to Charles Bowyer Adderley, who was created 1st Baron Norton in 1878 and still held Lea Marston in 1905. Adderley manor house was remodelled for the Adderley family in the 18th century and was called Hams Hall. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist seems to have existed by 1252, when it was a dependent chapelry of Coleshill parish church and was granted to the Benedictine Markyate Priory. The south wall of the nave and possibly the north wall date from this era. Two windows in the north wall are early 14th century in style. The nave was extended westwards in the 15th century for the addition of a bell-cot. The south porch is another addition that seems to date from the 15th century. In 1876-77 the chancel was rebuilt and the north-west tower was added. The tower has three bells, the oldest of which was cast by John Rudhall of Gloucester in 1791. The other two were cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1855 and 1873. The church contains numerous monuments to members of the Adderley family,Pevsner & Wedgwood, 1966, page 332 including one from 1784 made of Coade stone. The Rev. Thomas Bray was briefly vicar of Lea Marston in about 1693. Dr Bray later founded the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in 1699 and the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1701. Economic history There are records of a watermill in the parish in the Domesday Book of 1086, and again in 1291 and 1703. In 1909 a section of the Midland Railway was built through Lea Marston parish linking and to bypass . The line passes immediately south-east of Lea Marston village but there is no station. In the 20th century there were three Hams Hall Power Stations in the parish. Hams Hall A was built in 1927-29, Hams Hall B in 1949 and Hams Hall C in 1958. They were decommissioned in 1975, 1981 and 1992 respectively and each was demolished within a few years of closure. The site has since been redeveloped as Hams Hall Distribution Park.

History  The need for a training college for the police was pushed heavily by Sir Frank Newsam, who was the second most senior Home Office civil servant in the immediate post-war years. Sir Harold Scott, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in the late 1940s, also called for the establishment for such a college and it was established in June 1948 as the National Police College (taking its present name in 1979). The National Police Library was also established in 1948 and is still in existence, located in Ryton-on-Dunsmore. From 1948 to 1960 it was located at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire, but when Newsam became Permanent Secretary of the Home Office he secured for it a permanent base in Bramshill to which it moved in 1960. Bramshill was part of Centrex, the Central Police Training and Development Authority, established under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. On 1 April 2007, Bramshill became part of the National Policing Improvement Agency, which replaced Centrex. The NPIA supported the police service by providing expertise in areas such as serious crime analysis, training, operational support and in the development of new policing technologies and skills. With the creation of the professional body for policing, called the College of Policing in November 2012, the decision was taken to sell the Bramshill site. The College closed the site in March 2015 and the site has had planning applications to be redeveloped as housing development with 350 homes. To date (June 2020) these plans have been refused.  Governance  The Staff College was headed by a Board of Governors, half appointed by the Home Secretary and half by local authorities. Sir Frank Newsam was the founder chair of the board. The academic and administrative head of the College was the Commandant. There was also a Deputy Commandant, who was of the rank of Assistant Chief Constable or Commander, and an Assistant Commandant. Junior, Intermediate, and Senior Command Courses were run for Inspectors/Chief Inspectors, Superintendents and Chief Superintendents respectively. There was also the Special Course for sergeants.

The last version was introduced in March 2001 (original) and replaced Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 2 Green belts published in January 1995. #States the general intentions of Green Belt policy, including its contribution to sustainable development objectives #Reaffirms the specific purposes of including land in Green Belts, with slight modifications, gives policy a more positive thrust by specifying for the first time objectives for the use of land in Green Belts #Confirms that Green Belts must be protected as far as can be seen ahead, advises on defining boundaries and on safeguarding land for longer-term development needs #Maintains the presumption against inappropriate development within Green Belts and refines the categories of appropriate development, including making provision for the future of major existing developed sites and revising policy on the re-use of buildings. Planning Policy Guidance 3: Housing (1992-2006) PPG 3 advised local planning authorities on the treatment of housing within the planning process. The last version was introduced in March 2000 following the Rogers Report and replaced the 1992 version. Two updates were published on 24 January 2005 - Planning Policy Guidance 3: Housing: Planning for sustainable communities in rural areas and Planning Policy Guidance 3: Housing: Supporting the delivery of new housing. PPG3 was introduced to steer policy away from the development of large, spacious houses on greenfield sites, towards higher density development using brownfield or urban sites wherever possible. It also sought to compel developers to provide a greater element of affordable housing. Because of the slow speed at which Local Planning Authorities Local Plans were updated - and the recent changes to the planning system which abolished Local Plans in favour of Local Development Frameworks - local policy is often at variance with PPG3, resulting in confusion and a higher incidence of planning appeals. PPG3 was replaced with Planning Policy Statement 3 (PPS3) in November 2006. Planning Policy Guidance 15: Planning and the Historic Environment (1990 to 2010) PPG 15 advised local planning authorities on the treatment of historic buildings and the wider historic environment within the planning process. It was introduced in November 1990 following public outcry after a number of high-profile scandals such as the threatened destruction of the Rose Theatre in London by developers. It replaced the earlier Circular 8/87 which was criticised for being ill-focused in both practical and geographical terms. Circulars 01/2001 and 09/2005, which discuss arrangements for handling heritage applications and that amend the existing PPG 15: Planning and the historic environment, were published September 1994. PPG 15 as cancelled and superseded in 2010 by Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning and the Historic Environment. Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (1990 to 2010) Originally published in 1990, PPG16 was replaced by PPS 5 in 2010. Planning Policy Guidance 24: Planning and Noise (1994 to 2012)  PPG24 Planning and Noise was published in 1994. Noise assessments are normally requested as part of local council planning procedure. Noise tests should be conducted with a Class I noise meter for accurate results. Average noise levels (LAeq) are measured over a full 24-hour cycle - 16 hour (0700 - 2300) daytime, and 8 hour (2300 - 0700) night time. LAeq dB results provide a mean arithmetic average (dB(A)) which fall into a Noise Exposure Category (A, B, C or D), with categories B and C are usually passed with suitable noise mitigation measures put into place. A - Noise need not be taken as a determining factor in granting planning permission, although the noise level at the high end of the category should not be regarded as a desirable level. B - Noise should be taken into account when determining planning applications and, where appropriate, conditions imposed to ensure an adequate level of protection against noise. C - Planning permission should not normally be granted. Where it is considered that permission should be given, for example because there are no alternative sites available, conditions should be imposed to ensure a commensurate level of protection against noise. D - Planning Permission should normally be refused.

In a career spanning over 20 years; he played for eight clubs and scored more than 200 goals. He played as a centre forward and was nicknamed the \\"Chief\\". Playing career As a child Allison played for home town club Westend Juniors and was the first player from the club to turn professional. His first team was Halifax Town, whom he joined as trainee in August 1986, playing first games before signing a professional contract in July 1987. In two seasons with Halifax he scored 23 league goals in 84 games. Allison joined Watford for ¬£250,000 in July 1989, one of three players signed by Steve Harrison from Halifax during his tenure. At Watford he made only 7 appearances, scoring no goals. In July 1990 Watford signed Mark Gavin from Bristol City for a fee for ¬£250,000 and Allison, who was valued at ¬£150,000, went to City in exchange. He was more successful in Bristol, netting 57 goals in 225 games over a five-year spell at the club. Swindon Town manager Steve McMahon signed Allison in 1995 for a fee set by tribunal of ¬£475,000. A roaming player for the club, Allison's ability to hold the ball up whilst others advanced in support and also help in defence earned him inclusion in Swindon Town Football Club 100 Greats. He left Swindon for Huddersfield Town, his home town team, for the highest transfer fee of his career, ¬£800,000. However he moved again in September 1999 to Tranmere Rovers for ¬£300,000. He was cup-tied for their run to the 2000 Football League Cup Final. During his three-year stay at Tranmere he netted 32 goals in 117 appearances. In July 2002 Allison moved on a free transfer to Sheffield United. Although he had been offered a better deal at Third Division side Boston, he opted for the challenge of gaining promotion for the First Division club. He was a regular in a side that reached season both domestic cup semi finals in the 2002‚Äì03 season. He started in both the FA Cup semi final against Arsenal and in both legs of the League Cup against Liverpool. He made the last transfer of his career to Chesterfield on 25 June 2004 on a free transfer. Coaching and management On 25 February 2008, Allison left Chesterfield due to limited playing options as well as lack of support from the board for his application as assistant manager. After completing both his UEFA 'A' and 'B' licences Allison also passed his Certificate of Applied Management in the summer of 2008 before starting the first year of his pro licence in June. In August 2008, Allison began helping manager Simon Davies at Chester City and he was confirmed as assistant manager early the following month. On 15 October 2008, the day before his 40th birthday, it was announced Allison had agreed playing terms with the club. Despite being named as substitute on three occasions, he did not make any appearances for City. After Davies was sacked on 10 November 2008, Allison became Chester's caretaker manager but he informed the club he would not be applying for the position on a permanent basis. Before the club played its next match against Morecambe, Chester had reappointed Mark Wright as manager. Allison was involved in leading the team on the day but then announced he was leaving the club despite being offered the chance to remain. He later had a brief spell on the coaching staff at Bury before leaving in January 2009. He was appointed as a coach by Tranmere Rovers in October 2009, before moving to Bradford City in July 2011. In 2010 Allison completed a PhD at Sheffield Hallam University studying the effects of high-intensity exercise on decision-making in soccer. It was announced in early 2017 that Allison would replace Christian Edwards as the first team coach of Welsh Premier League side Cardiff Metropolitan University. Allison stepped down from the role in September 2017.https://clwbpeldroed.org/2017/09/19/allison-steps-down- as-met-manager/ References External links * *Swindon Town profile Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Huddersfield Category:English footballers Category:English football managers Category:Halifax Town A.F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football forwards Category:Chester City F.C. managers Category:Bury F.C. non-playing staff Category:Cymru Premier managers Category:Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C. managers Category:Alumni of Sheffield Hallam University ","title":"Wayne Allison"},{"id":"3669945","text":"Hochschule D√ºsseldorf The Hochschule D√ºsseldorf is a Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences) with departments for social sciences and cultural studies, technical sciences, architecture, media, design and business education in D√ºsseldorf.

He taught for many years at the Faculty of Music in Belgrade. Early life and career As a very young man, Dragutin showed an outstanding talent for art: besides composing, he also painted and sculpted. After graduating from two faculties (Faculty of Philosophy, Group for History of Art and sky diving, 1951; and Musical Academy, Department for Composition and Conducting, Class of professor M. ≈Ωivkovic) in 1952 he joined the Institute of Musicology at SANU on suggestion of Petar Konjoviƒá. Still a young research assistant, he started his long-term and prolific work in the field of music theory and musicology. However, although his successful musical works (the ballet Remi in 1960 and the Concerto Accelerato, 1961) were greatly appreciated and brought him rewards in the country and abroad, at the beginning of the 1960s Gostu≈°ki stopped composing. Dragutin Gostu≈°ki‚Äôs principal field of work was comparative aesthetics, a discipline he established in Serbia. He is still considered its only outstanding proponent. His theoretical work over many years resulted in a major study called The Time of Art (1968), a work which stands out as a unique synthesis of his views on key questions of art history and aesthetics. Gostu≈°ki was the first doctor of musicology in Serbia after the Second World War and the only one to defend his PhD thesis in Belgrade at the Faculty of Philosophy (Department for Pure Philosophy); and also the first to become interested in questions of music semiology. He was the founder and the president of the Organizational Committee for The First International Music Semiology Conference (Belgrade, 1973). From 1974 (when he was promoted to scientific counselor) until 1978, Gostu≈°ki was the director of the Institute, and his second book, a collection of essays called Art in Lack of Evidence (1977) also attracted the attention of the domestic intellectual and cultural public. Participating in all essential elements of Serbian musical culture, Gostu≈°ki was one of promoters and members of the BEMUS Board; Yugoslav Chorus Festivities (Ni≈°); the October Gallery and the Jazz Festival, as well as a member of the International Art Committee with its main office at UNESCO in Paris. His numerous appearances as a critic for Belgrade Television musical programs established a stylistic standard of eloquent and simple speech as well as shrewd and witty opinions. From 1974 to 1980, Gostu≈°ki organized and directed, at the Institute of Musicology at SANU, scientific public panels called Conversations about Science and Art. Many eminent experts in the natural and humanistic sciences of the time participated. As a first-class intellectual of European scope, he followed with vigilant attention and commented upon problems concerning the cultural and political orientation of Serbian people. A thinker of encyclopedic capacity and great powers of lucid expression, Gostu≈°ki was also the most prominent figure in Serbian music criticism. The texts he published, more than 400 of them, not only present a specific chronicle of Belgrade music life but also provide a model of superb style and original, often witty critical views on key phenomena of art as an integral part of life.

It was built in the early 17th century by the 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the Italian Renaissance, which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952. The mansion's southern fa√ßade is notable for its decorative architecture, which includes at its centre a large oriel window above the principal entrance. Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen, an ornate drawing room, and a gallery. Numerous columns and friezes are found throughout the mansion, while several rooms have large tapestries depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls. The house is set in of grounds containing an lake. The grounds, which received a listing in 1984, are part of a Registered Historic Park that includes about of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house. The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland. Bramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century. The cricket ground at the house played host to a first-class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI, and it hosted three other matches in 1825‚Äì26. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home, before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years. It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960, and was later home to the European Police College. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to haunt the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later. Location Bramshill House is at the approximate centre of a triangle formed by Reading, Basingstoke and Farnborough, about by road southwest of central London. It lies to the northeast of Hartley Wintney, east of Hazeley off the B3349 road, southeast of the village of Bramshill, which lies on the B3011 road. Three main lanes approach the property: Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest, Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north, and the shorter Pheasantry Drive which approaches it from the southeast from Chalwin's Copse, just north of the course of the River Hart. Within the grounds is a private lane, Lower Pool Road, which connects Mansion Drive to Reading Drive South, passing the pond and several outer buildings. The latitudinal and longitudinal location is 51¬∞19'57.9\\"N 0¬∞54'43.2\\"W or also, 51.332759, ‚àí0.911991. History =Original house= The 1086 Domesday Book lists one of the two manors of Bromeselle (the Anglo-Norman spelling of Bromshyll) as held by Hugh de Port. In the early 14th century, Sir John Foxley ( ‚Äì c. 1325), Baron of the Exchequer, built and endowed a chapel in the village of Bramshill. His first wife, Constance de Bramshill, may have been the heiress of the Bramshill family. Their son, Thomas Foxley (c. 1305‚Äì1360), became MP for Berkshire in 1325, and was appointed constable of Windsor Castle in 1328, soon after the accession of the 14-year-old Edward III. In 1347 he obtained a licence to build a manor house or small castle at Bramshill, which included a wooded park. The house, built between 1351 and 1360, had thick walls, vaulted cellars, and an internal courtyard measuring . Based on the similarity of the surviving vaults under Bramshill House and those under what became the servants' hall and steward's room at Windsor Castle, it may have been a copy of William of Wykeham's work there. The estate remained in the hands of the Foxley family and their heirs, the Essex family, until 1499, when it was sold to Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney. Giles's son Henry Daubeney (later Earl of Bridgewater) sold the property to Henry VIII, and in 1547 Edward VI granted the estate to William Paulet, whose heirs sold it in 1600 to Sir Stephen Thornhurst of Agnes Court, Kent. =New manor house= Lord Zouche bought the property from Sir Stephen Thornhurst in 1605. In March 1605, Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, a favourite of James I, bought the property from Thornhurst. A house was earlier planned on the site for Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (1594‚Äì1612), whose heraldic feathers are displayed above the central pediment. Lord Zouche demolished a large part of the building and began to build the Bramshill House of today. Henry Shaw describes the new house which Zouche built as a \\"specimen of Elizabethan architecture [which] merits particular attention, exhibiting all the stateliness for which the period referred to was remarkable, with a suite of apartments both large and lofty. The amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence.\\" An inventory taken in 1634 after Zouche's death listed the library as having 250 books and a collection of mathematical instruments, and revealed that the maids' chamber was of a very high standard. James Zouch, grandson of Edward la Zouche, sold the property to the Earl of Antrim in 1637, at which time the house's furniture was valued at ¬£2,762. During the reign of Charles I, the house was partly destroyed by a fire. On 25 June 1640, Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for ¬£9,500 to Sir Robert Henley. In 1673 it was the property of his son, Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet. Sir John Cope purchased the property in 1699, and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935. The Cope family shortened the wings on the south side in 1703, converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century. They were responsible for much of the interior, with significant renovation work done in the 19th century and in 1920. After his victory over Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington was offered his choice of house by Parliament; he visited Bramshill but in 1817 chose Stratfield Saye instead. =Sporting events= Numerous paintings and prints depict games and social events taking place on the lawn; one such painting by Joseph Nash, now in the National Fencing Museum, depicts 17th-century rapier practice, with a number of upper-class men, women and children as spectators. The cricket ground at the house first played host to a first-class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI. Hampshire won by five wickets. Two further first-class matches were played there in 1825, when Hampshire drew against Godalming and defeated Sussex. A final first-class match was held there in 1826 when a combined Hampshire and Surrey team played and lost to Sussex. =Modern times= In 1935, the house was purchased from the Cope family by Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket, the house's last private owner. It was used by the Red Cross as a maternity home during the Second World War, after which it became the home of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for several years.\\" Bramshill House became a Grade I listed building on 8 July 1952, and was acquired by the British government the following year as a dedicated site for police training. It became the location of the National Police College in 1960. From 2005, two buildings on the site housed the European Police College (CEPOL) until this was moved to Budapest in 2014. By the late 1980s the estate had become expensive to maintain, and according to John Wheeler, Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, by 1989 it was \\"in a poor state of repair\\". In July 2013 the Home Office placed the house and estate on the market for ¬£25 million. It was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. In 2018, the house, with a reduced estate of about 90 acres, was put back on the market with a guide price of ¬£10 million. Architecture =Exterior= The front (southern) fa√ßade of Bramshill House The 15-bedroom Bramshill House is one of the largest and most important Jacobean mansions in England, described as one of the \\"glories of English architecture\\" by the historians Anthony Blunt and James Lees-Milne. The architecture of the three-storey building was inspired by the Italian Renaissance, and was executed mainly by German builders. It is approximately in length. The design is traditionally attributed to the architect John Thorpe, although no records remain to confirm the attribution. The building stands on the edge of a plateau, overlooking the park to the south. The plan of the house is unusual, partly because of its incorporation of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) fa√ßade. The elevations are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie at either end of the eastern and western sides. Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular. North and south The central bay and loggia of the south entrance The north fa√ßade has three bays separated by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, with a central arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at either side of the gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house. The southern fa√ßade was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"among the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in [England]\\". It is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing, with five inner sections. The outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows, aligned in rows of four on the first two floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor. The inner two sections have the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor, but the ground floor features two arches, which form part of the central loggia. The stone central bay, wide, is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on all floors and the central archway of the loggia in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, surmounted by a florid perforated pediment. In addition there is an oriel window on the first floor above the main entrance. An important difference from the other sides of this building is a terrace, in width, between the projecting wings, a kind of architectural foreground to the garden. The terrace is bounded by a balustrade. The arcade on the terrace of the southern front is a good example of Italian domestic architecture, used in villas. The triglyphs and ornamented metopes, together with the simple capitals of the columns, indicate the Doric order, but are light enough to be Ionic. The south entrance was the model for Darlington, the Crocker-McMillin Mansion in New Jersey, US, built between 1901 and 1907. East and west The east fa√ßade is the longest, about wide, and two storeys high. It features four full-height angular bays with two windows between, while its upper walls have two arches set within a rectangular panel. On this side there is a Troco Terrace with a lawn, as well as two arcaded openings at the side on either wing of the house. The southernmost arcaded opening contains a bench with eight arches and has three tables, one of which is older and octagonal. Carved in the wall at the side is a frieze consisting of four squares, each depicting an animal: a lion, an elephant, a wild boar and a camel. The west fa√ßade dates to the 18th century and is the only one with multiple gables; the windows on the ground floor are sashed. =Interior= Ground floor plan in the 1880s Two of the rooms have large tapestries on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes. Those in the drawing room contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by Peter Paul Rubens, who supervised the work in Brussels. These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother-diplomat, but in the end he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens's sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in Alte Pinakothek (Munich). The west section of the ground floor contains the former dining room and kitchen. The openings in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north side of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas. The Great Hall, to which an arcaded porch gives direct access, retains the basic design of the original construction. It has a dais and a Jacobean stone screen, high, decorated with 92 shields. Resident families emblazoned the shields with the arms of ancestors and family members. The entablature of the screen has a double row of 40 sculptured shields and has a depth of . Beyond the dais, double doors lead into the Terrace Hall at the foot of the staircase. Across from this is the former dining room, containing a large tapestry, believed to have been made by an English artist, \\"representing forest scenery in very subdued colours\\". During the time of the Cope family in the 1880s, the kitchen near the south hall was used as a dairy. The kitchen and the adjoining room had back-to-back fireplaces. Drawing room and library The drawing room in 1903 The drawing room, containing four bay windows of different sizes, is panelled with oak for its entire height of about . One of the upper panels, surmounted by its Corinthian entablature, is a frieze depicting a fig, grape, and pomegranate, each with foliage and blossoms. One of the lower panels, part of the dado in the same room, has a section of projecting mouldings. The upper panel is ; the lower, . The massive chimneypiece in the drawing room is classically designed, believed to be inspired by one of the great Italian architects of 16th-century Mannerism, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola. It is two storeys in height, the lower being Doric and the upper Ionic. The distribution of the members is regular, and the shafts of the columns are variegated marble. The upper compartment of the chimneypiece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material, and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre. The fireplace is wide and high, and retains the ancient andirons, used for burning wood. These are large and well adorned, particularly in the lower part. The ceilings of the drawing room and library are the most elaborate in the house. The plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship; wide, it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern, with an evident Florentine influence. In the 1880s the library had a collection of 5,000 volumes, about half the number the Cope family owned at the time. Staircase and first floor First floor plan in the 1880s The standards and balusters of the stairs on the north side of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century. The walls above the stairs and on the first-floor landing contain some very large paintings, including several portraits.Bramshill House 9331, Country Life, Retrieved 20 July 2013 Beyond the staircase are the state rooms and what was known as the \\"Wrought Room\\". The room has an ornamental ceiling with a Renaissance chimneypiece. Two of the bedrooms, the two \\"White Rooms\\", were originally connected to what was called the Flower-de-luce Room, but the doors have been boarded up. The Long Gallery fills the first floor of the northern range: long and with a richly decorated stucco ceiling and a complex wooden chimneypiece, it formerly contained a \\"very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters\\". Also on the first floor is the \\"Chapel Drawing Room\\" in the south wing, connected to the Drawing Room. The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel, which is entered through it. The current chapel has an altar reredos with paintings of the Virgin Mary, St. Stephen, St. Mary Magdalene and St. John the Evangelist, by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840. The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house, and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier; in the early 19th century it had hung in the Red Drawing Room. When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope, it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood. The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel. Grounds and garden View of Bramshill House from its grounds to the south Gate of the park, 1899 The house is set in of grounds, which include an lake north of the house. The grounds form part of a Registered Historic Park that received a Grade II* listing in 1984; this was subsequently upgraded to Grade I in September 2017. Under this designation are the of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house, the wider medieval park, landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century, with of woodland and buildings including an icehouse and a folly known as Conduit House. Parts of the park have been used for commercial softwood production since the 19th century. To the west of the house is Peatmoor Copse and to the east Bramshill Forest, and the grounds contained what was known as the \\"Green Court\\" and the \\"Flower Garden\\" at the time of William Henry Cope in the 1880s. The Grade I listed gatehouse dates to the time of the Foxleys. The fir trees in the grounds are reputed to have been planted \\"as a memento of his former home\\" by James I, who brought them from Scotland. The formal gardens were first laid out by Edward la Zouche, a horticulturist. Sir John Cope redesigned the gardens and continued the planting of trees in the park. At the close of the 18th century the grounds were re-landscaped to be less formal, and some areas in the south were returned to parkland. Main entrance Bramshill Park was conceived as a \\"hunting box\\" for Henry Frederick and became a popular estate for hunting. On 24 July 1621, while hunting in the park, George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, accidentally shot and killed one of the gamekeepers with his crossbow. An inquiry cleared him of murder. Another notable clergyman/hunter who frequented Bramshill was Charles Kingsley, rector of Eversley, who hunted fox and deer and collected butterflies there and frequently took his family and friends. Kingsley was reportedly especially enamoured of the fir trees, which he considered \\"a source of constant delight\\", fondly naming them \\"James the First's gnarled giants\\". In the 19th century, Sir John Cope, a friend of Kingsley's, was known as a supporter of the fox hunt and especially as a breeder of fox hounds. The opening of the season at Bramshill in the late 1840s was noted in the British hunting press. The main avenue approaches from the southwest, through an arched gateway formed by two Grade II listed early 19th-century lodges, before crossing the Broad Water formed by the River Hart by a Grade I listed early 19th-century bridge with two arches. There are separate listings for other structures near the house, including the Grade I listed early 17th-century triple-arched gateway on the route to Reading to the northeast of the house, Grade I listed early 17th-century boundary walls and turrets to the south and west, Grade II listed boundary walls and gate-piers to the west, including the kitchen garden, Grade I listed garden walls and gateways to the north and east, and the Grade II listed late 18th-century stable block to the north. Legends Bramshill has been cited as one of the most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, although another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century. In addition, Bramshill House was cited by the historian William Page as a possible location for the Legend of the Mistletoe Bough, a ghost story associated with several English country mansions. This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of hide and seek on her wedding night. In the case of Bramshill House, the story has it that this happened at Christmas time, and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand; the chest is on display in the entrance hall. The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope's daughter Anne, who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire. An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini, who was married in 1727, and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest. In his monograph on the house, the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original, which had been proved large enough by \\"a woman of comely proportions\\" who had tested it by lying down in it, but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope's widow in 1812. The ghost of the bride is referred to as the White Lady, and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room. According to Legg, Michael I of Romania asked to be moved to another room during a stay there, in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night. An old man with a grey beard, thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady, is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest.

It was fought between the crown forces of Queen Elizabeth I and the Gaelic clan of MacDonnell, with military support from Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, and resulted in a defeat for the English.  Background  The north- east of Ulster was much fought over during the 16th century. Carrickfergus itself had been the base for a failed English attempt to colonise that corner of the province in the 1570s, but in the following decades the English influence gave way to the MacDonnells under the leadership of Sorley Boy. In 1595 the Irish lords in Ulster rose out in rebellion under Hugh O'Neill, and the crown's only foothold in Co. Antrim was at Carrickfergus, and a small garrison in Belfast Castle. The MacDonnells adopted a wait-and-see policy, without committing themselves fully to the crown in its campaign to break the rebellion, though they facilitated Tyrone's arms shipments out of Scotland, primarily Glasgow.O'Neill, The Nine Years War, p. 113 In 1597, the recently appointed English governor of Carrickfergus Castle, John Chichester, had enjoyed successes against the strongholds of the Clandeboye O'Neills, and was negotiating with Sorley Boy's nephew, James MacSorley MacDonnell, over a series of raids and counter-raids in the locality. The Scots were aggrieved over certain cavalry operations that had lately been carried out in the governor's absence, and a parley was arranged for 4 November 1597 to hear their demand for reparations. Unknown to Chichester, James MacSorley had met with Tyrone on 1 November, where the earl offered his daughter's hand in marriage, and more importantly reinforced the Scots with 500 Irish shot armed with calivers.O'Neill, The Nine Years War, p. 69 The battle East wall and keep of Carrickfergus Castle On the appointed day MacDonnell was sighted by the English on his approach to Carrickfergus Castle at the head of 700 troops. Not wishing to be outdone, the governor came out with the bulk of his men, just five companies of foot - who were wearied from a recent expedition - and one of horse. He led them out four miles, until the Scots were encountered, and then halted to allow his troops to close up on the advanced guard. In the interval the officers debated, one veteran urging the governor to proceed with the parley. But when his troops drew up, the governor turned to his commander, Captain Merriman (correctly Marmion), and said, \\"Now, Captain, yonder be your old friends. What say you? Shall we charge them?\\" Merriman (Marmion) assented, and was supported by the commander of the horse, Moses Hill. The order to charge was given, and the Scots fell back over the hilly terrain. But the English riders were not sure of their lead, and the governor was quickly isolated with a small party, which had managed to keep pace with him. Moreover, MacDonnell had drawn the English into a trap. MacDonnell had hidden 800 troops to his rear, which included Scots bowmen, swordsmen and Irish pike but more significantly 500 Irish shot.Calendar of State Papers Ireland, 1596-7, pp 465-7. Without warning, volleys of shot poured into the English ranks from Tyrone's shot hidden on rough ground. On a counter-charge, the Scots and Irish surged around and broke the formation of the crown troops. The governor was wounded in the leg but tried to rally his men by remounting and charging down the slope. He was shot through the head and killed outright. Another officer was hit in the head and captured, another had his horse shot out from under him, and another was shot through the shoulder. The crown forces were dismayed, and although reinforcements - including the sick, so depleted was the garrison - sallied out from the castle and prevented a massacre, the death toll on the English side reached 180, with 30-40 wounded. Some managed to survive by swimming away in Larne Lough, with or without their horses, and fetched up on the shore of the peninsula of Island Magee. After the battle James MacSorley had Chichester's head cut off, packed in a barrel and sent to the earl of Tyrone in Dungannon.Calendar of State Papers Ireland, 1596-7, pp 444-5.  Aftermath  The English defeat was partly put down to a lack of gunpowder, but there was no attempt to excuse the crassness and ineptitude of the governor's conduct. Despite the size of the force he had chosen to bring to a mere parley, MacDonnell had little difficulty in justifying his own conduct. There was some irony in the Scots' victory, because MacDonnell's father, Sorley Boy, had sacked the town over twenty years before in revenge for the English massacre of clan dependents on Rathlin Island.

Early in his career, he was a star player in the International League, shortly before Jim Crow restrictions were imposed that banned African-American players from organized baseball. Grant then became a pioneer in the early Negro leagues, starring for several of the top African-American teams of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is widely considered to have been the greatest African-American player of the 19th century. In 2006, Grant was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Baseball career Grant was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He played semipro baseball in Pittsfield and in Plattsburgh, New York. In 1886, Grant played for an Eastern League team based in Meriden, Connecticut. He signed with the Buffalo Bisons in the International League, one level below the major leagues, later that season. Though most sources indicate the official integration of organized baseball would not come for several more decades, Grant was one of five black players who played in baseball's otherwise white minor leagues at the time. When he debuted with the team, a Buffalo newspaper reporter referred to Grant as \\"a Spaniard\\". He hit .344 with Buffalo that season. Grant (front row, second from right) with the 1887 Buffalo Bisons. The following season, his teammates refused to appear with him for another photo.Klein, Jeff Z. \\"Heritage Moments: Frank Grant, the Buffalo Bisons and the drawing of baseball's color line\\". news.wbfo.org. April 23, 2018. Retrieved April 30, 2019. In 1887, the 22-year-old batted .353, paced the IL with 11 home runs and 49 extra-base hits and led Buffalo with 40 stolen bases. In 1887, John Chapman, the Bisons' veteran manager, valued Grant's services at $5,000‚Äîquite a compliment when Chicago had recently sold superstar King Kelly to Boston for $10,000. During the 1887 season, Grant hit for the cycle in one game and stole home twice in another. Despite significant racial turmoil that year, Buffalo forced the IL to rescind a proposed color line to keep Grant in town. By 1888, anti-black sentiment was all around the league, and it seemed only Buffalo argued against segregation (possibly because of Grant). When blacks were banned from organized, white-controlled baseball in 1889, Grant went on to become a successful Negro leaguer for the Cuban Giants, Cuban X-Giants, Big Gorhams and Philadelphia Giants into the 20th century. His career ended in 1903. Author Jerry Malloy described Grant as \\"the greatest Negro baseball player of the 19th century.\\" In the late 19th century, few black hitters matched up with Grant. He had substantial power at the plate, often hitting home runs and very often getting extra-base hits. Grant hit for extra bases every four times he got a hit. He achieved this even though he was quite small (5'7\\", 155 pounds). A middle infielder, mostly a second baseman, Grant had fielding skills widely praised as the best in the league. He was known as \\"The Black Dunlap\\", a comparison drawn to the defensive skills of 19th-century white second baseman Fred Dunlap. Grant is also notable for becoming the first black player to play on the same team in organized baseball for three consecutive seasons. Later life and legacy After his baseball career, Grant's name rarely appeared in the press. He lived a quiet life as a waiter for a catering company. Grant died at age 71 in New York City. His grave in East Ridgelawn Cemetery, Clifton, New Jersey, was unmarked until June 2011. In 2006, Grant was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the earliest Negro league player to have received that honor.

It stars Carroll Baker in the title role, and Raf Vallone, Red Buttons, Angela Lansbury, Peter Lawford, Mike Connors, Martin Balsam, and Leslie Nielsen in supporting roles. It was released by Paramount Pictures, shortly after another film with the same title and subject. Although the film failed commercially, it was successful in launching the hit song \\"Girl Talk,\\" by Neal Hefti. Plot The film opens with Harlow as a struggling extra and bit actress dealing with her greedy stepfather Marino (Raf Vallone) and oblivious mother \\"Mama Jean\\" (Angela Lansbury, only six years older than Carroll Baker). With the help of Arthur Landau (Red Buttons), she rises to fame and gains the unwanted attention of the Howard Hughes-inspired Richard Manley (Leslie Nielsen). She then marries Paul Bern (Peter Lawford), an absentee husband who kills himself some time after the marriage. His death, combined with the stress of her career, leads Harlow on an odyssey of failed relationships and alcoholism, culminating in her death of kidney failure at the age of twenty-six.

In 1962, it was officially released that Marilyn Monroe would play Harlow in a lavish biopic as a part of her new contract with Fox. However, after Monroe's death, the project was sold to Paramount, who cast Carroll Baker in the title role. Based in part on Harlow: An Intimate Biography, writer Irving Shulman's pulp biography, Paramount's Harlow is a melodramatic look at Harlow's life, focusing on her failed marriages. The widescreen Technicolor film, produced by Joseph E. Levine, was made on a $2.5 million budget, and featured a wide- reaching publicity campaign. Douglas later said that during filming Baker \\"was very sick, physically and also mentally, I think. She was going through bad times. But she did a hell of a good job on the picture.\\" DVD release On September 28, 2010, Olive Films released Harlow on Region 1 DVD in the United States.

It originally aired on Fox on January 29, 2006, around the time of Super Bowl XL, which fits the sports theme of the episode. In it, Peter goes to his high school reunion and meets Tom Brady. After Peter runs to the bathroom and tackles most of the people in his way, Brady hires him for the New England Patriots. Peter wins many games for the Patriots but is fired for showboating and is traded to a team in London called the Silly Nannies. Peter plays versus the Patriots and loses, and returns home. Meanwhile, Stewie becomes a bookie who attacks Brian until he pays off his debt. \\"Patriot Games\\" was written by Mike Henry and directed by Cyndi Tang, and guest starred Tom Brady, Troy Brown, Jay Leno, Carol Channing, and Bob Costas as themselves. The episode received positive reviews from critics and finished as the 55th most-watched program of the week. Plot summary At his high school reunion, Peter pretends to be a secret agent-astronaut-millionaire who wears a cowboy hat to impress his classmates, but the truth comes out when he meets Tom Brady. He subsequently gets drunk and has to make a run for the bathroom, knocking over everyone between him and the bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively- choreographed version of the song \\"Shipoopi\\" after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who apparently have no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them, having now regained respect for him. Meanwhile, Stewie becomes a bookie and takes a $50 bet from Brian on a Celebrity Boxing match pitting Mike Tyson against Carol Channing. Brian bets on Tyson and loses. Stewie comes to collect, but Brian laughs him off and tells him he will have the money in 24 hours. After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian says he does not have it and to give him until next Friday. Stewie reveals that he is serious about settling the bet and, on two occasions, brutally beats up Brian (using such means as a golf club, shooting him in both knees with a pistol, and a flamethrower) to coerce him into paying up. Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's bet is satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one \\"free revenge shot\\" to make up for all the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian. After biding his time and making Stewie worry about what could happen, Brian‚Äîwhile the Griffins are in London, leaving the Patriots-Silly Nannies game‚Äînonchalantly shoves Stewie in front of a moving bus. Production Mike Henry wrote the episode. \\"Patriot Games\\" was written by Mike Henry, and directed by Peter Shin, Pete Michels and Cyndi Tang. The episode aired on January 29, 2006, a week before Super Bowl XL. Actress Carol Channing made a guest appearance as herself in a scene in which Brian loses a $50 bet on a boxing match between her and professional boxer Mike Tyson, though Tyson did not voice himself. Sportscaster Bob Costas also voiced himself in a short scene in which he interviews Peter and Tom Brady. Much of the episode was scripted with Patriots coach Bill Belichick in mind, but Brady was chosen to replace him. After numerous requests for Brady to voice himself in the episode, he eventually agreed. Comedian Jay Leno voiced himself in two short scenes that show him, respectively, threatening and attempting to kill Brady. Two scenes in which Stewie brutally beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members‚Äîas well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate‚Äîenjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: \\"I don't see what the problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!\\", and so it was kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of \\"Volume Four\\"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet to try to find a definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode). In 2009, the bathroom scene was reused for a series of YouTube videos promoting the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series nominations that Family Guy received for consideration to voters for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. In it, Brian considers voting for the fellow nominees‚ÄîThe Office,FAMILY GUY ‚Äì Brian's Emmy Vote ‚Äì The Office Flight of the Conchords,FAMILY GUY ‚Äì Brian's Emmy Vote ‚Äì Flight of the Conchords Entourage,FAMILY GUY ‚Äì Brian's Emmy Vote ‚Äì Entourage 30 Rock,FAMILY GUY ‚Äì Brian's Emmy Vote ‚Äì 30 Rock How I Met Your Mother,FAMILY GUY ‚Äì Brian's Emmy Vote ‚Äì How I Met Your Mother and Weeds.FAMILY GUY ‚Äì Brian's Emmy Vote ‚Äì Weeds In the first five videos, Stewie brutally beats up Brian for his different votes, in their respective videos, asking \\"Where's my Emmy man?\\" and forces him to vote for Family Guy. In the last video, when Brian thinks about voting for Weeds, Stewie doesn't beat him up and instead says, \\"Oh, fuck this. I'm not doing one for fucking Weeds,\\" referring to the declining quality of the show within its fourth season. Cultural references The episode features a 2.5-minute rendition of the song \\"Shipoopi\\" from the 1957 musical The Music Man, conducted by Peter and performed by the Patriots and people in the stadium. The rendition was directed by Dan Povenmire, who would later go on to co-create Phineas and Ferb with fellow Family Guy worker Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh. The original number in The Music Man was performed by around 40 or 50 singers and around 80 other musicians, as estimated by MacFarlane. Family Guys rendition was recorded by an orchestra not as large as the original's, but one of the largest the show has ever used. Another musical number, in which the London Silly Nannies sing while dancing around a maypole, was taken from the Gilbert and Sullivan production The Sorcerer. A visual joke that shows Peter's $30,000 wax sculpture of Harriet Tubman \\"doing\\" a naked Gwyneth Paltrow originally featured the droid R2-D2 from Star Wars in place of Tubman. MacFarlane is a fan of Star Wars, and its characters are often featured in the series' jokes. A spoof drama programme called Condensation is shown on BBC Four, which is a BBC channel dedicated to the arts, culture and factual programmes. The episode title is taken from the 1987 Tom Clancy novel Patriot Games. Reception \\"Patriot Games\\" was watched by 8.45 million viewers, making it the 55th most-watched program of the week. According to MacFarlane, the episode polarized viewers, who either \\"hated or loved the violence\\". Ryan J. Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also said that it was \\"fun\\" and that you could tell the crew had a good time making it. Overall, he considered it \\"not a bad episode. The scene eventually became one of the most popular videos on YouTube.\\" The episode ranked number 1 in IGN's Top 10 Musical Moments in the show, for \\"Shipoopi,\\" and Stewie's assault on Brian in the bathroom was named the 5th greatest fight scene in the show on another list.

It is a tree- lined boulevard which runs south from the pont Saint-Michel on the Seine river and the Place Saint-Michel, crosses the boulevard Saint-Germain and continues alongside the Sorbonne and the Luxembourg gardens, ending at the Place Camille Jullian just before the Port-Royal railway station and the avenue de l'Observatoire. It was created by Baron Haussmann to run parallel to the rue Saint-Jacques which marks the historical north-south axis of Paris. It is known colloquially as Boul‚ÄôMich‚Äô. The boulevard serves as a boundary between the 5th and 6th arrondissements of Paris; odd-numbered buildings on the eastern side are in the 5th arrondissement and even numbers on the western side are in the 6th. It has a length of 1380 m, an average width of 30 m and takes its name from the pont Saint-Michel. As the central axis of the Latin Quarter, it has long been a hotbed of student life and activism, but tourism is also a major commercial focus of the street and designer shops have gradually replaced many small bookshops. The northern part of the boulevard is now the most frequented, due to its bookstores (such as Gibert Joseph and the Gibert Jeune), caf√©s, cinema and clothes shops. The main buildings of the boulevard are the Mus√©e de Cluny, the lyc√©e Saint-Louis, the √âcole des Mines, and the cit√© universitaire, the university area of the Sorbonne. History The boulevard Saint-Michel was the other important part of Haussmann's renovation of Paris on the Left Bank along with the creation of the boulevard Saint-Germain. It was formerly approximated by the rue de la Harpe which for centuries led from the Seine to the Porte Saint-Michel, a gate to the walls of Paris near what is now the intersection of the Boulevard Saint-Michel and rue Monsieur le Prince. Construction of the Boulevard was decreed in 1855 and began in 1860. The boulevard was initially known as the boulevard de S√©bastopol Rive Gauche, but was changed to Boulevard Saint-Michel in 1867.Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, p. 477, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, The name is derived from the eponymous gate destroyed in 1679 and the subsequent Saint-Michel market in the same area (the current Place Edmond Rostand). Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, p. 113, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, Numerous streets disappeared as a result of the boulevard's creation, including the rue des Deux Portes Saint-Andr√©, the passage d'Harcourt, the rue de M√¢con, the rue Neuve de Richelieu, the rue Poup√©e, part of rue de la Harpe and of rue d'Enfer, part of the former place Saint-Michel and the rue de l'Est. The part of the boulevard Saint-Michel at the entrance of the rue Henri Barbusse and the rue de l'Abb√© de l'Ep√©e was previously known as the place Louis Marin. During 1871, the H√¥tel des Etrangers was the meeting place of the Vilains Bonhommes (renamed Circle Zutique by Charles Cros) which included Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. Jules Vall√®s, socialist writer and survivor of the Paris Commune was buried in the cemetery of P√®re-Lachaise. His body was carried there from the funeral home at n¬∞ 77, into which 10,000 people are claimed to have squeezed.

Pandulf IVAlso spelled Randulf, Bandulf, Pandulph, Pandolf, Paldolf, or Pandolfo. (died 1049/50) was the Prince of Capua on three separate occasions. From February 1016 to 1022 he ruled in association with his cousin Pandulf II. In 1018, the Byzantine catapan Boiannes destroyed the Lombard army of Melus of Bari and his Norman allies at Cannae. This victory brought the Byzantines recognition by all the princes of the Mezzogiorno, which had previously owed allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. Among these Pandulf was most ardent in his support of the Byzantines. He assisted Boiannes in capturing Melus' brother-in-law Dattus' tower on the Garigliano in 1020, but this brought a large army down from Germany. A detachment under Pilgrim, Archbishop of Cologne, marched down the Tyrrhenian coast and besieged Capua. In 1022 the prince was taken and a new prince, Pandulf, count of Teano, installed. Pandulf IV was brought in chains to the Emperor Henry II, who almost executed him before Pilgrim intervened on his behalf. He was then imprisoned in Germany for two years. He was released by Emperor Conrad II in 1024 at the request of Prince Guaimar III of Salerno, who was hoping for a new ally. Assisted by Guaimar and the Norman adventurer Rainulf Drengott, Pandulf immediately besieged Capua. In 1025, Boiannes, who had been busy on a Sicilian expedition, joined them with a huge force. In 1026, after a siege of 18 months, the city fell. The count of Teano was given safe passage to Naples by the Byzantine commander. Pandulf resumed his rule and remained in power until 1038. In 1027, he defeated and deposed Sergius IV of Naples, but Sergius was reinstalled in 1029 by a Norman army under Rainulf, Pandulf's one-time ally, who in return received the county of Aversa, the first Norman toehold in the Mezzogiorno. Next, Sergius moved against the abbot of Montecassino. The previous abbot, Atenulf, who had supported Pandulf, had fled from the invading imperial army in 1024. The new abbot, Theobald, had been the candidate of the Emperor and the Pope. After inviting him to Capua, Pandulf threw him in prison, where he joined the deposed archbishop of Capua. In 1032, Pandulf turned his attention to Sergius' old ally, John V of Gaeta. He conquered Gaeta and took over the consular and ducal title of its ruler. For all this, he was called by the chronicler Aim√© of Monte Cassino a fortissime lupe, the Wolf of the Abruzzi, a man of \\"wily and wicked deeds\\". Subsequently, Guaimar IV of Salerno, the son of Guaimar III (who died in 1027), asked the two emperors--Eastern and Western--to come and resolve the many disputes rupturing Southern Italy. Only Conrad accepted. Arriving at Troia in 1038, he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, giving 300 lbs of gold (in two installments) and a son and daughter as hostages. The emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the filial hostage escaped and Pandulf took refuge in his outlying castle of Sant'Agata de' Goti. Conrad took Capua and gave it to Guaimar with the title of Prince. He also recognised Aversa as a county of Salerno. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to Constantinople, seeking the protection of his old Byzantine allies. The political dynamic having changed, however, Pandulf was imprisoned. Subsequently, Guaimar became an enemy of Emperor Michael IV and, before the latter's death, Pandulf was released from captivity. He returned to Italy in 1042. For the next five years, he and his few followers threatened Guaimar. In 1047, a watershed year in the history of the Mezzogiorno and the Lombards, Emperor Henry III, Conrad's son, came down and made the Drengot and Hauteville possessions his direct vassals. At Capua, he restored Pandulf to power for the last time. Pandulf died in his own princedom on 19 February 1049 or 1050. Notes References *Chalandon, Ferdinand.

He changed the face of film songs by combining the popular Raags with the verve and rhythm of Punjabi music, and also helped raise the status of film music directors. He is also known for giving a break to the well-known playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar. In an interview, Lata Mangeshkar herself disclosed on her 84th birthday in 2013, \\"Ghulam Haider is truly my Godfather. It was his confidence in me that he fought for me to tuck me into the Hindi Film Industry which otherwise had rejected me\\". Remembering her early rejection, Lata once said, \\"Ghulam Haider was the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent. He introduced me to many producers including S. Mukerji, a big name in film production, but when he too declined me, Ghulam Haider was very furious. Hence, finally he convinced Bombay Talkies, a banner bigger than S. Mukerji and introduced me through their movie Majboor (1948 film)\\".Who is Lata Mangeshkar's Godfather? glamsham.com website Published 27 September 2013, Retrieved 25 March 2018  Early life  According to one account, Ghulam Haider was born in 1908 in Narowal, Punjab, British India (now in Pakistani Punjab). Another account says that he was born in Hyderabad, Sindh. After passing his intermediate examination, he was admitted to a college of dentistry and completed his education as a dentist. Being curious about music, he started learning music from Babu Ganesh Lal. His love for music made him leave his career as a dentist, facing the wrath of his family, he still found a job with Alfred Theatrical Company and Alexander Theatrical Company as a piano player in Calcutta, and worked with Jenaphone (Genophone) Recording Company as a music composer as well. He composed music for the then famous singer, Umrao Zia Begum, who was working for Pancholi Studios, Lahore. He later married her.  Career  Haider broke into films with the father-son duo Roshan Lal Shorey and Roop Kumar Shorey, and then A.R. Kardar gave him the opportunity to compose music for the 1935 film, Swarg Ki Seerhi. But he got his first big breakthrough with D.M. Pancholi's Punjabi film, Gul-E-Bakavali (1939) starring Noor Jehan. This was followed by film Yamla Jat (1940). His first big hit song came with Khazanchi in 1941, which helped cause a revolution in the music industry. The music of the film Khazanchi (1941), in particular, the song Sawan Ke Nazare Hain sung by Shamshad Begum and Ghulam Haider himself caused a revolution in music composing. By then Music Directors of the 1930s, who had composed film songs set in classical ragas, were beginning to sound commonplace. Khazanchi's refreshingly 'free wheeling music' not only took the audiences by storm but also made other film music directors sit up and take notice. With this film, Ghulam Haider ensured that the Indian film song would never be the same again. Khandan (1942), the first film of Noor Jehan as lead actress, was also a big hit and established him as a top film composer. Film Poonji (1943) was also successful. Then Haider moved to Bombay and composed music for many films including Humayun (1945) and Majboor (1948 film), the first major breakthrough film for Lata Mangeshkar in Hindi films. Films Shaheed (1948) and Kaneez are his other big hits. =Pioneering work= He introduced Lata Mangeshkar, Sudha Malhotra and Surinder Kaur to the Indian Film Industry. Besides them, as a film song composer, he played a key role in giving first breakthrough popularity to Noor Jehan in film Khandan. Master Ghulam Haider also gets major credit for introducing the Punjabi folk music and instruments like dholak in the film music. His pioneering work in music later inspired many Punjabi film music directors like Hansraj Behl, Shyam Sunder, Husnlal Bhagatram and Feroz Nizami. His assistants in Mumbai were film music composers Madan Mohan and Nashad. Later in Pakistan, film music director A. Hameed worked as his assistant. Death After independence in 1947, he returned to Lahore and his first Pakistani film was Shahida (1949). He composed music for many other Pakistani films like Beqarar (1950), Akeli (1951) and Bheegi Palken (1952) but the films flopped. He died just a few days after the release of Pakistani film Gulnar (1953).

It has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1998. The site is known as one of the most important and best preserved prehistoric sites of the eastern Mediterranean. Much of its importance lies in the evidence of an organised functional society in the form of a collective settlement, with surrounding fortifications for communal protection. The Neolithic aceramic period is represented by this settlement and around 20 other similar settlements spread throughout the island. Discovery The site was discovered in 1934 by Porphyrios Dikaios, director of the Department of Antiquities who carried out six excavations between 1934 and 1946. His initial findings were published in The Journal of Hellenic Studies in 1934. Further excavations were then held in the early 70's but were interrupted by the Turkish invasion of the island. A French mission under the direction of Alain Le Brun resumed excavation of the site in 1977. It was occupied from the 7th until the 4th millennium BC. Archaeology The settlement of Khirokitia is situated on the slope of a hill in the valley of the Maroni River, towards the southern coast of the island about 6 km from the sea. Subsistence methods practiced by its Neolithic inhabitants included farming crops, herding sheep and goats, and raising pigs. It is a closed village, cut off from the outside world, apart from by the river, by a strong wall of stones 2.5 m thick and 3 m at its highest preserved level. Access into the village was probably via several entry points through the wall. The buildings within this wall consist of round structures huddled close together. The lower parts of these buildings are often of stone and attain massive proportions by constant additions of further skins of stones. Their external diameter varies between 2.3 m and 9.20 m while the internal diameter is only between 1.4 m and 4.80 m. A collapsed flat roof of one building found recently indicates that not all roofs were dome shaped as was originally believed. The internal divisions of each hut were according to the purpose of its usage. Low walls, platforms designated work, rest or storage areas. They had hearths presumably used for cooking and heating, benches and windows and in many cases there is evidence of piers to support an upper floor. It is believed that the huts were like rooms several of which were grouped around an open courtyard and together formed the home. The population of the village at any one time is thought not to have exceeded 300 to 600 inhabitants. The people were rather short ‚Äì the men about 5' 3\\" on average and the women about 4' 11\\". Infant mortality was very high. On average adult men reached 35 years of age and women 33. The dead were buried in crouched positions just under the floors of the houses. In some instances provision was made for offerings, possibly indicating a form of Ancestor cult within the households. This, the earliest known culture in Cyprus, consisted of a well-organised, developed society mainly engaged in farming, hunting and herding. Farming was mainly of cereal crops. They also picked the fruit of trees growing wild in the surrounding area such as pistachio nuts, figs, olives and prunes. The four main species of animals whose remains were found on the site were deer, sheep, goats and pigs. The village of Choirokoitia was suddenly abandoned for reasons unknown at around 6000 BC and it seems that the islandUNESCO World Heritage Centre entry remained uninhabited for about 1500 years until the next recorded entity, the Sotira group. More recent discoveries, however, including several sites in the vicinity of the ancient acropolis of Amathus on the eastern edge of modern Limassol, have filled this chronological gap considerably, revealing that the island was probably occupied continuously at least from the ninth millennium BC. Early communities were small and widely dispersed, so not every region would have been as heavily exploited as later in prehistory Simmons 1999; Simmons 2001 (both with previous references); Peltenburg et al. 2001; Steel 2004, 19‚Äì32. Village name According to the dominating opinion the name of the village is a composite of the word \\"Khiros\\" (hog / pig) and the word \\"Kiti\\", thus suggesting an area where pigs were raised. Other sources claim that the original name was \\"Sidirokitida\\", thus an area were iron was found. It is also said that it might have originated from the word \\"Khirogetia\\", which implies the practice of palmistry. According yet to another opinion, it may have originated from some initial name like \\"Ierokitida\\" (Sacred place). Yet more imaginative opinions claim that the name came from the words \\"gyros\\" and \\"oikia\\" due to the fact that the prehistoric huts are round. Furthermore, tradition has it that the name is derived from the phrase \\"Chere Kitia\\" a phrased used by the Queen \\"Rigena\\" to address a certain female friend of hers from Kition. It was also claimed that maybe the name originated from the plant Annona cherimola, which is found cultivated in Cyprus under the more simple name \\"Cheromolia\\", although this is considered very unlikely. At any rate, in old maps the village is marked as either Cherochetica or as Chierochitia.

History In 1838, brass movements had mainly replaced wooden and cast iron movements in most clocks due to the volumes of supply of rolled brass. In 1844, metal dealer Anson Greene Phelps formed the Ansonia Brass company in Connecticut, to supply the expanding clock business - nine companies were producing clocks in Connecticut. In 1850 the Ansonia Clock Company was formed as a subsidiary of the Ansonia Brass Company by Phelps and two Bristol, Connecticut, clockmakers, Theodore Terry and Franklin C. Andrews. Terry & Andrews were the largest clock manufacturers in Bristol, with more than 50 employees using 58 tons of brass in the production of about 25,000 clocks in 1849. Phelps decided to get into the clockmaking business to expand the market for his brass, while Terry and Andrews got access to better quality brass at better prices. They had resultantly sold 50% of their business to Phelps, and moved the business to Ansonia. =Expansion= In 1877 the clock company purchased a factory in New York, and moved most of its production there after being spun off from the brass company. Henry J. Davies of Brooklyn, himself a clockmaker, inventor and case designer, joined the newly reconstituted company as one of its founders. As President, he is thought to have been largely responsible for the figurine clocks, swing clocks and other unusual and desirable novelties for which the Ansonia firm became known. Thomas Edison visited the factory in 1878 to experiment combining clocks with his newly developed phonograph. But the experiments proved unviable. By 1879, a second factory was opened in Brooklyn, New York and by June 1880 employed 360 workers, while the Connecticut factory continued producing clocks as well with a workforce of 100 men and 25 women. Hence, clocks marked \\"Connecticut\\" were generally produced before 1879, while those marked \\"New York\\" were all produced after 1880 =The peak years= After the New York factory burnt down in 1880 - the loss was reported to be $750,000 with only $395,000 insured. (See New York Times October 28, 1880; https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/10/28/103611305.pdf ). The company rebuilt the factory on the same site, and reopened the expanded factory in 1881, with capacity to exceed that of the Connecticut factory - which closed completely in 1883. By 1886, the company had sales offices in New York, Chicago and London, and more than 225 different clock models were being manufactured. The prosperous and debt-free Ansonia Clock Company reported having an inventory worth $600,000 and receivables valued at $250,000. In 1904, Ansonia added non-jeweled watches to their line, and produced an estimated ten million of these by 1929 In 1899, Phelps' grandson William Earle Dodge Stokes commissioned architect Duboy to build the \\"greatest and grandest hotel in Manhattan, New York.\\" New York's first air conditioned building, the Ansonia Hotel still stands at 2107 Broadway, albeit as a condominium apartment block Ansonia model: C.1904, SANTIAGO, color caoba. =Downfall= In early 1914, just before World War I, Ansonia was producing 440 different models. However, the novelty clock became subject to fierce competition. As Ansonia's strongest selling line, rather than maintain profit, Ansonia attempted to gain volume by offering clocks at \\"old pricing\\". Maquinaria del Reloj Ansonia modelo: C.1904. This tactic racked up huge debts, and by 1920 the number of models was down to 136 models, and 47 by 1927. In 1926 the company sold its Brooklyn warehouse, but this could not stem the inevitable. In 1929 the majority of the timekeeping machinery and tooling was sold to the Soviet government's US trading company Amtorg, just before the stock market crash. The parts, machinery and key skilled workers were shipped out of the USA to form the basis, along with the remains of a watch company purchased a year later, of the clock and watch industry in Moscow such as Poljot and Sekonda. In 1969, the rights to the use of the name, trademarks, and goodwill were transferred to Ansonia Clock Co., Inc., Lynnwood, Washington.

On this expedition Mitchell was instructed to travel to Menindee, then down the Darling River to the sea, if it flowed there; or, if it flowed into the Murray River to go up the Murray to the inhabited parts of the colony. However lack of water forced Mitchell to follow the Lachlan River to the south-west as the only practicable route. He reached the Murrumbidgee on 12 May and followed it to the Murray. At the end of May, Mitchell reached the Darling and turned north upstream. He soon decided, while still about in a direct line from Menindee, to abandon the survey of the deserts around the Darling and to use his resources to explore the more promising country along the Murray. Retracing his steps Mitchell went up the Murray until 20 June when he reached the junction of the Loddon where the country seemed so promising that he turned south-west into what is now Victoria and was so enchanted by the area he called it ‚ÄúAustralia Felix‚Äù. The reports of excellent farming land from Mitchell's return to Sydney with the news, started a land rush.

The water of the YamunƒÅ for four leagues all around him boiled and bubbled with poison. No bird or beast could go near, and only one solitary Kadamba tree grew on the river bank. The celebration of NƒÅga NathaiyƒÅ or NƒÅga N·πõitya is associated with the tale of Lord Krishna dancing upon and subduing KƒÅliya. Story The story of Krishna and KƒÅliya is told in the sixteenth chapter of the Tenth Canto of the Bhagavata Purana. The proper home of KƒÅliya was the island of Rama·πáaka, but he had been driven away from there in fear of Garu·∏ça, the foe of all serpents. Garu·∏ça had been cursed by the yogi Saubhari dwelling at Vrindavan so that he could not come to Vrindavan without meeting his death. Therefore, KƒÅliya chose Vrindavan as his residence, knowing it was the only place where Garu·∏ça could not come. Once, the sage DurvasƒÅ came as a guest and was served by RƒÅdhƒÅ. After this episode, RƒÅdhƒÅ took a walk across river YamunƒÅ and became terrified upon seeing the giant serpent. She fled to Vrindavan where she informed the people that she had seen a giant serpent in river. Lord Krishna was very angry upon hearing this and wanted to teach a lesson to KƒÅliya as he had troubled his RƒÅdhƒÅ. He went to the river YamunƒÅ searching for KƒÅliya, who upon seeing Krishna, coiled around Krishna's legs and constricted him. The Gokul people came to see that Krishna was in the river. Ya≈õodƒÅ was afraid of the snake and ordered Krishna to return at once. Meanwhile, KƒÅliya attempted to escape, but Krishna stomped on his tail, and warned him to not trouble anyone again before returning to the people. The next day, Krishna was playing a ball game across the Yamuna with RƒÅdha and friends. After the ball fell into the YamunƒÅ, RƒÅdhƒÅ tried to retrieve it, but Krishna stopped her and offered to do so. When he went into the YamunƒÅ, KƒÅliya constricted him and pulled him into the YamunƒÅ. The Gokul people heard the commotion and all the people of Nandagokula were concerned, and came running towards the bank of the YamunƒÅ. They heard that Krishna had jumped into the river where the dangerous KƒÅliya was staying. At the bottom of the river, KƒÅliya had ensnared Krishna in his coils. Krishna expanded himself, forcing KƒÅliya to release him. Krishna immediately regained his original form and began to jump on all of KƒÅliya's heads so as to release the poison in the snake so that he could no longer pollute the YamunƒÅ. KƒÅliya Daman, 1880. Krishna suddenly sprang onto KƒÅliya's head and assumed the weight of the whole universe, beating him with his feet. KƒÅliya started vomiting blood and slowly began to die. But then KƒÅliya's wives came and prayed to Krishna with joined palms, worshiping him and praying for mercy for their husband. KƒÅliya recognised the greatness of Krishna and surrendered, promising he would not harass anybody again. Krishna pardoned him after performing a final dance upon his heads. After the performance, Krishna asked KƒÅliya to leave the river and go to Rama·πáaka island, where he promised that KƒÅliya would not be troubled by Garu·∏ça. The people who had gathered on the banks of YamunƒÅ were terrified, beholding the water that had changed to a poison color. Krishna slowly rose up from the bottom of the river while dancing on KƒÅliya's head. When the people saw Krishna, everyone were happy and they danced ecstatically upon KƒÅliya. At last, KƒÅliya was pushed into PƒÅtƒÅla where he is said to reside to this day. This event is often referred as the KƒÅliya NƒÅga Mardan. Fiji connection According to the legend, Krishna banished Kaliya to the Ramanik Deep, which the Fiji Indians believe to be in Fiji. Moreover, native Fijians also believed in a serpent-god called Dengei.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data.

It was named for the Iroquois people. Via the Kankakee and Illinois rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River. Course The Iroquois River rises in Jasper County, Indiana, and flows generally west-southwestwardly through Newton County, Indiana, and Iroquois County, Illinois, where it turns northward and flows into Kankakee County, Illinois. It enters the Kankakee River from the south in Kankakee County, opposite the village of Aroma Park, about southwest of the city of Kankakee. Along its course the Iroquois passes the town of Rensselaer, Brook, and Kentland in Indiana and the towns of Iroquois, Watseka and Sugar Island in Illinois. Variant names According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Iroquois River, or portions thereof, has also been known as: *Borntrager Ditch *Burns Ditch *Irokois River *Iroquois Ditch *Pickamick River *Pickamink Lateral *Pickamink River *Pinkamink River *Swain Ditch *Thompson Ditch =La rivi√®re des Iroquois= The name, La rivi√®re des Iroquois was given to the riverway by the French, through the Annual of Ren√© de la Salle. It has been proposed that the river got it name from la Fourche des Iroquois or the Fork of the Iroquois, now Aroma Park. The French phrase would be a reference to \\"the Irouquois' Fork\\" or a place where the French or the French allied tribes (Illini) had an experience with the Iroquois at this location.Native American Place Names of Indiana; Michael McCafferty; University of Illinois Press, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois; April 2008 The French explores had arrived in the Kankakee basin Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1679. The Iroquois had been raiding across the Michigan Peninsula over the previous decade and began to move further west around the southern tip of Lac de Illinois or Lake Michigan. In 1682 he built Fort St. Louis atop Starved Rock State Park on the Illinois River as a place of refuge from raiding Iroquois. Thus, the history of the Beaver Wars as the Iroquois raids became known and the French name for the junction of the modern Iroquois River and the Kankakee River implies the movement of Iroquois raiding bands through this location and probably using the Iroquois River route as their way around the Great marsh of the Kankakee. A legend among the Illinois tells of a time the Iroquois were surprised along the bank of this waterway and were driven away with great losses.

His family moved to Washington D.C. where he graduated from Central High School. He earned a B.S. in pharmacy from George Washington University. Career After school, he worked as a pharmacist at a local drug store. In 1955, he and his wife, cosmetician Gloria Haft, opened the first drug discount store, Dart Drug in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, D.C. He quickly ran into problems as consumer goods wholesalers and pharmaceutical distributors refused to sell to him because his prices were lower than their other customers. Haft unsuccessfully sued until Parke-Davis - at the time one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. - was charged by the Justice Department with price-fixing. Haft was a lead witness in the case which was eventually won by the government. The drug distributors - fearful of government action - returned to selling to Dart Drug and the business boomed. In the late 1970s, his son Robert, a graduate of Harvard Business School, joined the firm. Applying the same principle of mass retailing, the father and son team launched Crown Books. In 1984, he sold Dart Drug - then with 75 stores - for $160 million but retained control of the holding company, Dart Group. He also founded (with family members) Trak Auto, Combined Properties,, and acquired part of Total Beverage and Shoppers Food Warehouse. Haft's Dart Group earned $250 million through greenmail and stock sales during unsuccessful takeover attempts of retailers Safeway and Stop & Shop. In the 1990s, he was involved in widely publicized conflict with his sons Ronald and Robert Haft, and wife Gloria Haft over control of the Dart Group, a family business. In a 1986 speech to a group of George Washington University alumni, Haft said that the secret of his success, was to borrow big: \\"If you owe someone several thousand dollars, you can't always sleep at night. If you owe someone several million dollars, the banker or supplier can't sleep. It's no use both of you worrying.\\" In 1998, Total Beverage was sold to Total Wine & More and the remainder of Dart Group, except Crown Books, was purchased by Richfood, a grocery distributor for $200 million. Richfood quickly sold Trak Auto to a Tennessee investment group. Crown Books filed for bankruptcy, and limped along on private investment until its closure in 2001. In 1999, Herbert Haft launched HealthQuick, an online pharmacy, while his son Robert launched Vitamins.com. HealthQuick failed by 2001. Personal life He was married to Gloria Haft for 45 years before divorcing; they had three children: Robert Haft, Ronald Haft, and Linda Haft. Haft was a member of Washington Hebrew Congregation. He and his family were engaged in a long-standing and bitter feud that culminated in his deathbed marriage to Myrna C. Ruben and the exclusion of his children from his will.

It encouraged Protestants to relocate to Brandenburg. French Hugenots fleeing to Brandenburg  Background  On 22 October 1685, King Louis XIV of France issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which was part of a program of persecution that closed Huguenot churches and schools. This policy escalated the harassment of religious minorities since the dragonnades created in 1681 in order to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism. As a result, a large number of Protestants ‚Äî estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000 ‚Äî left France over the next two decades. Across the Rhine it has been estimated that the Holy Roman empire had lost a third of its population through slaughter, famine and plague during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). The western part of Brandenburg-Prussia fell within the empire: badly depopulated, the territory faced a desperate labour shortage during the second half of the seventeenth century.  The edict  Encouraged by the French theologian-philosopher Jakob Abbadie, on 29 October 1685, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg issued the Edict of Potsdam. Large number of religious refugees had arrived by ship at Cadzand and other coastal ports in the Netherlands. The edict, which reflected a hands-on practical approach by the Prussian leadership, provided for Prussian diplomats in Amsterdam to arrange ships to transport these by sea to the Free City of Hamburg where Prussian representatives would be on hand to arrange transport up the Elbe to their chosen destinations in the Brandenburg-Prussia heartland. For people fleeing from eastern and southern France provision was made for a land route via Sedan and the Duchy of Cleves, which had become a territory of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1666, and where the Great Elector (as the Prussian ruler is identified in English language history books) had arranged for them to be settled locally or transported on via the Rhine to new homes further east. In its third section the edict spelled out a succession of suggested places where the migrants might wish to live, and went on to promise \\"free choice [as to] their place of settlement... wherever they find it most convenient to practice their professions and trades\\". The edict expressly ruled out any customs duties or other taxes on assets that the migrants had been able to bring with them. Migrants would be accommodated in abandoned and dilapidated properties which their owners had lacked the means to make habitable. They would receive their properties free of mortgages or other debts or obligations, and they would be provided at no cost to themselves with the necessary timber and other building materials. Any former proprietors would be compensated for the transfer value of properties allocated to the migrants, and the new settlers would enjoy a six-year tax holiday in respect of any property taxes (though they would remain subject to the same taxes on consumption as other citizens). In some of the many places where tracts of abandoned cultivable land had been identified, the elector's edict provided for the perpetual freehold of these to be allocated to his \\"French Protestant Comrades in Belief\\" (\\"Evangelisch-Reformirten Glaubens-Genossen\\"), free of mortgages or other encumbrances. Materials would be provided for refugee farmers to bring their land into cultivation and construct homes. A ten-year tax holiday was included in the package. The edict also recorded that in affected localities officials had been mandated to hire town houses where Huguenot refugees might be received and accommodated with their families rent free for up to four years while arrangements for them to create their own farms were put in place, although this generous provision was expressly conditional on beneficiaries subsequently bringing their farms into production. It was spelled out that as soon as a French Protestant migrant family had settled in a town or village they should enjoy full legal and civic equality with the elector's existing subjects. Significantly, they would not be subjected to any discriminatory so-called \\"Droit d‚ÄôAubaine\\" or other burden with which foreign immigrants in other kingdoms, states and republics would be encumbered. Migrants were to be permitted to hold church services in their native French language John Stoye ‚Äî Europe Unfolding 1648-1688 p.272 and to set up their own schools. The elector moved fast. On 9 November 1685 translations of the Edict were printed in German, French and Dutch. These were quickly distributed to the affected areas in France using secret couriers and local Protestant networks.  Results  It is estimated that approximately 20,000 Huguenot refugees relocated to Brandenburg-Prussia in response to the Edict of Potsdam. The contrast between the generosity of the Prussian ruler's Edict of Potsdam and the vindictiveness of the self-styled \\"Sun king's\\" Edict of Fontainebleau was conscious and widely remarked. The embryonic state became a center of European immigration, its religious freedom attracting not only French Protestants but also the persecuted of Russia, the Netherlands, and Bohemia. Thus, the immigrants to the Electorate of Brandenburg stabilized and greatly improved the country's economy following the destructive wars that had swept through Europe in the seventeenth-century. The Edict of Potsdam was not a product of mere altruism or publicity-seeking on the part of an ambitious German prince. A large immigrant community personally linked to the ruler by their religious beliefs also strengthened the ruler's own position in relation to the landed nobility and the powerful Lutheran interests. In a north German state with only limited access to natural resources, there was also a compelling economic case to be made for returning to productive usage land which had been abandoned since the Thirty Years' War. A particularly well documented case is that of the farmer Jean Harlan, based in Calais and barely 20 years old when the Edict of Fontainbleau was proclaimed in 1685. With others, he escaped in a boat along the English Channel, surviving as far as Cadzand on the Dutch coast. In one of the several \\"transit\\" points set up by Prussian officials in the Netherlands, he was provided with financial support and documentation, before moving on to Uckermark, close to the Oder River. Here he met and in February 1689 married Marie Le Jeune, another Huguenot refugee who had managed to escape from France with her three children. In Uckermark they were allocated an empty farmstead, together with building material, seed corn, two horses, a cow, and 50 Thalers. Uckermark was a particular focus of Huguenot resettlement. The farmstead was one of 2,900 available for settlement in the area, where the package including \\"two horses, a cow, and 50 Thalers\\" was apparently the standard one. The Harlans were able to benefit from the grants and tax privileges provided by the Edict of Potsdam, and Jean Harlan later went on to build a business as a tobacco merchant. His son, Jakob Harlan, subsequently founded a commercial dynasty of upwardly mobile business people.

Steamed flour can also be pounded, shaped, or pan-fried to make tteok. In some cases, tteok is pounded from cooked grains. The pronunciation is between a \\"t\\" and a \\"d\\" sound, ending with \\"-ukk\\". It could also be written as ttukk, ddukk, dhukk, or ddeok. Tteok is enjoyed not only as a dessert or seasonal delicacy, but also as a meal. It can range from elaborate versions made of various colors, fragrances, and shapes using nuts, fruits, flowers, and namul (herbs/wild greens), to plain white rice tteok used in home cooking. Some common ingredients for many kinds of tteok are red bean, soybean, mung bean, mugwort, pumpkin, chestnut, pine nut, jujube, dried fruits, sesame seeds and oil, and honey. Tteok is usually a food that is shared. Tteok offered to spirits is called boktteok (\\"good fortune rice cake\\") and shared with neighbours and relatives. It is also one of the celebratory foods used in banquets, rites, and various festive events. Tteokguk (\\"rice cake soup\\") is shared to celebrate Korean New Year and songpyeon is shared on Chuseok, a harvest festival. Utensils for making tteok Below are cooking utensils used to make tteok in the traditional Korean way. * Ki (ÌÇ§), winnowing bamboo basket * Inambak (Ïù¥ÎÇ®Î∞ï), rice-washing bowl * Bagaji (Î∞îÍ∞ÄÏßÄ), gourd-like dipper * Ongbaegi (ÏòπÎ∞∞Í∏∞) and jabaegi (ÏûêÎ∞∞Í∏∞), large, round pottery bowls * Che (Ï≤¥) and chetdari (Ï≥áÎã§Î¶¨), sieve and sieve-frame legs * Maetdol (Îß∑Îèå), grinding stone * Jeolgu (Ï†àÍµ¨) and jeolgutgongi (Ï†àÍµøÍ≥µÏù¥), mortar and pestle * Anban (ÏïàÎ∞ò) and tteokme (Îñ°Î©î), wooden pounding board and malletvideo * Siru (ÏãúÎ£®) and sirumit (ÏãúÎ£®Î∞ë), earthenware steamer and mat placed in the bottom of it * Sot (ÏÜ•) and geonggeure (Í≤ÖÍ∑∏Î†à), cauldron and steaming rack * Beoncheol (Î≤àÏ≤†), thick frying pan * Chaeban (Ï±ÑÎ∞ò), wicker tray * Tteoksal (Îñ°ÏÇ¥), wooden tteok pattern stamp Types Tteok is largely divided into four categories: \\"steamed tteok\\" (Ï∞åÎäî Îñ°), \\"pounded tteok\\" (ÏπòÎäî Îñ°), \\"boiled tteok\\" (ÏÇ∂Îäî Îñ°) and \\"pan-fried tteok\\" (ÏßÄÏßÄÎäî Îñ°). The steamed tteok is made by steaming rice or glutinous rice flour in \\"siru\\" (ÏãúÎ£®), or a large earthenware steamer, so it is often called \\"sirutteok\\" (ÏãúÎ£®Îñ°). It is regarded as the basic and oldest form of tteok. Pounded tteok is made by using a pounding board or mortar after steaming it first. In making pan-fried tteok, the rice dough is flattened like a pancake and pan-fried with vegetable oil. Shaped tteok are made by kneading dough with hot water, then shaping it into balls. =Steamed tteok= The main ingredients for steamed tteok or \\"sirutteok\\" are rice (ÎßµÏåÄ, maepssal in Korean) or glutinous rice (Ï∞πÏåÄ chapssal), and sometimes they are mixed together. In some cases, other grains, beans (azuki beans or mung beans), sesame seeds, wheat flour, or starch are mixed with the rice. Various fruits and nuts are used as subsidiary ingredients, such as persimmons, peaches or apricots, chestnuts, walnuts, and pine nuts. In addition, marinated vegetables or herbs can be used to flavor the tteok. Danggwi leaves (Ostericum grosseserratum), seogi mushroom (manna lichen), radish, artemisia, pepper, and cheongju are the most common flavorings, and honey and sugar are used as sweeteners. In order to make steamed tteok or sirutteok, rice or glutinous rice is soaked in water for a while, then ground. The prepared rice flour is put in a siru and steamed. According to steaming method, sirutteok is subdivided into two groups: seolgitteok (ÏÑ§Í∏∞Îñ°), which is shaped into a single large lump, and kyeotteok (ÏºúÎñ°), which consists of multiple layers with adzuki bean powder or other bean powder. Seolgitteok is also called muritteok (Î¨¥Î¶¨Îñ°), which is regarded as the most basic form of sirutteok because it is made only of rice. When making kyeotteok, rice and glutinous rice are mixed. The name kyeotteok derives from the adverb kyeokeyo (ÏºúÏºú, literally \\"layered\\") in Korean because this tteok is made in layers. *Baekseolgi (Î∞±ÏÑ§Í∏∞) - a variety of siru tteok. It literally means white snow tteok and is made of white rice. *Kongtteok (ÏΩ©Îñ°) - tteok made with various kinds of beans *Jeungpyeon or Sultteok - tteok made with makgeolli (unfiltered rice wine) *Mujigae tteok (Î¨¥ÏßÄÍ∞úÎñ°) - literally \\"rainbow tteok\\"; this variety of tteok has colorful stripes.

Injeolmi (tteok coated with adzuki bean powder or roasted soybean powder), garaetteok (Í∞ÄÎûòÎñ° cylinder-shaped white tteok), jeolpyeon (Ï†àÌé∏ patterned tteok) and danja (Îã®Ïûê glutinous tteok ball coated with bean paste)‚Äù are the most commonly eaten pounded tteok.Bacon- Mushroom Frittata Rice and glutinous rice are hulled to make grain particles or powder and then steamed in a siru (earthenware steamer) and pounded with utensils. The pounded tteok is divided by rice type into glutinous pounded tteok (Ï∞πÏåÄÎèÑÎ≥ë chapssal dobyeong) and non-glutinous pounded tteok (ÎßµÏåÄÎèÑÎ≥ë mapssal dobyeong). Injeolmi, a representative of glutinous pounded tteok, varies in accordance with gomul types (Í≥†Î¨º, coating made with bean powder, sesame seeds, or sliced jujubes) or subsidiary ingredients mixed into the steamed rice while pounding on the anban. Patinjeolmi (Ìå•Ïù∏Ï†àÎØ∏), and kkaeinjeolmi (Íπ®Ïù∏Ï†àÎØ∏) are examples for the former, coated with red bean powder and sesame, respectively.

He worked in the court at Innsbruck as a violinist at least between 1656 and 1660. Between 1672 and 1676 he was director of the court music at Innsbruck, which, after the extinction of the Tyrolean Habsburgs, had come under the control of the emperor. Although in publications of 1678 Viviani still described himself as holding this position, it seems more likely that he was in fact in Venice working on his arrangement of Francesco Cavalli‚Äôs Scipione affricano and his own opera Astiage, which were both performed in Venice that year. Also that year, Viviani directed an oratorio at the Oratorio di San Marcello in Rome with Arcangelo Corelli and Bernardo Pasquini. He was probably elevated to the nobility in the same year, since he subsequently designated himself ‚ÄòNobile del Sacro Romano Imperio‚Äô. Between 1678 and 1679 and 1681 and 1682 he was in Naples as director of a troupe of opera singers, and while he was there he performed some of his own operas and oratorios. In 1686 he was maestro di cappella to the Prince of Bisignano. From January 1687 to December 1692 he was maestro di cappella of Pistoia Cathedral. As a composer Viviani is known mostly for his operas and solo cantatas which follow the style of Antonio Cesti. It is speculated that Viviani studied with Cesti during his Innsbruck years which accounts for the similarities in style between the two composers; in any case he certainly knew Cesti‚Äôs work. His instrumental works are predominantly in the Italian style, though south German and Austrian influences are also recognizable. Of particular interest are the instrumental recitatives of the Sinfonia cantabile in his op. 4, which is written in imitation of a solo cantata; there are also two sonatas in op. 4 for trumpet and continuo. The Solfeggiamenti, textless vocal pieces intended for teaching purposes, are unusual examples of this genre because of the number of their movements and their exceptional length. His other compositions include two sonatas for trumpet and organ, two sonatas for solo trumpet, sonatas for violin and continuo, and several Capriccios.

Biography Born in Vilnius, Lithuania (occupied by Poland from 1919-1939), Vilenska was active in Hashomer Hatzair in Vilnius, the city in which she attended high school, before emigrating to Mandatory Palestine in 1938. She attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, gaining a BA in sociology and an MA in History. =Political career= Vilenska joined the Palestine Communist Party in 1940, and in 1943 was appointed editor of the newspaper Kol HaAm (lit. Voice of the People), becoming chief editor in 1947. In 1944, she was elected to the House of Representatives. She joined the politbureau of Maki when it was formed upon Israeli independence in 1948, and in 1949 became a member of the executive committee of the Histadrut, a role she served in until 1973. In the same year (1949), she was elected to Tel Aviv's city council. She was elected to the Knesset in 1951, stepping down from Tel Aviv city council. Vilenska was a member of the Knesset until 1959, and then again from 1961 until 1965. Her tenure in the Knesset was marked by vigorous defense of civil liberties and a desire to improve economic and social conditions for women. In 1973, she left Maki and founded a new party, Aki (, an acronym for Opozitzia Komunistit Yisraelit (), lit. Israeli Communist Opposition), serving as editor of its monthly paper. =Journalism= In addition to her political work, Vilenska was also a widely published writer. She was a regular contributor to leftist publications around the world, including the Saturday Morning Freiheit, a Yiddish language weekly published in New York. Vilenska's articles focused on identifying trends within the Israeli left and finding solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but often delved into cultural and international issues, such as the jailing of the African-American communist activist Angela Davis. Vilenska published numerous pamphlets and several books in Hebrew, Russian, Yiddish and English. Vilenska's labor history, Confrontation and Unity within the Labor Movement (1889‚Äì1923), was published posthumously in 1976. =Personal life= Vilenska met and married fellow Maki leader, Meir Vilner in the 1940s. Vilenska later married Zvi Breitstein, also an editor of Kol HaAm. Vilenska and Breitstein lived in the Kiryat Shalom section of Tel Aviv and had two children. They were married until Vilenska's death in 1975.

Boundaries and geography Similar to many other neighborhoods that are undergoing gentrification in New York City, this Washington Heights area was renamed by real estate brokers in the 1990s to sound more appealing to a different type of community than was attracted to the main part of Washington Heights. Like many New York City neighborhoods, the boundaries of Hudson Heights are not precise.Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city. (There are a number of Community Boards, whose boundaries are officially set, but these are fairly large and generally contain a number of neighborhoods, and the neighborhood map issued by the Department of City Planning only shows the largest ones.) Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people. One definition has it bounded by the Hudson River to the west, Broadway to the east, 173rd Street to the south, and Fort Tryon Park to the north,Harris, Elizabeth A. (October 16, 2009) Map included in \\"An Aerie Straight Out of the Deco Era\\" The New York Times.

Hudson Heights: 173rd Street to Fort Tryon Park, West of Broadway\\" Retrieved June 22, 2010. but another would limit the neighborhood to the top of the high ridge which physically separates it from the rest of Washington Heights. By this definition, Hudson Heights is bounded in the west by the Henry Hudson Parkway, in the east by Fort Washington Avenue, in the south by West 181st Street and in the north by Fort Tryon Park.Staff (September 17, 2001) \\"Manhattan apartments at a discount: Hudson Heights\\" New York The ridge the neighborhood sits on overlooks the river to the west and the Broadway valley to the east. In 2018, The New York Times defined it as being bordered by 173rd Street in the south, Bennett Avenue in the east, the northern boundary of Fort Tryon Park in the north, and the Hudson River in the west.Jacobsen, Aileen (March 28, 2018) \\"Living In: Hudson Heights: A Hidden Gem, Gaining Popularity\\" The New York Times Using the more restrictive boundaries, the neighborhood's main north‚Äìsouth thoroughfares are Fort Washington Avenue (two-way), Pinehurst Avenue (one way south) and Cabrini Boulevard (formerly Northern Avenue, one way north). Riverside Drive runs intermittently along the bottom of the ridge to the west, while Bennett Avenue and Overlook Terrace do the same on the east, with Overlook Avenue climbing to the top of the ridge at West 190th Street. The east‚Äìwest streets are all numbered, from West 181st Street to West 190th Street, but none of those streets, with the exception of West 181st at the southern end of the ridge, cross all the way through the neighborhood: they are all interrupted at one point or another, which makes navigation of the area difficult for those not familiar with its peculiarities.  History  = 17th century = Before European explorers and settlers, the Lenape Indians lived on the island they called Manhatta. Just to the north of Hudson Heights, in what is now Inwood Hill Park, the Lenape tribe exchanged the island for items worth about 60 Dutch Gilders in a deal with Peter Minuit in 1626. He named the island New Amsterdam. The area north of central Manhattan was called Niew Haarlem until the British gained control of the area during the Revolutionary War. They renamed the area Lancaster, and gave it a northern border near what is now 129th Street. The ridge that overlooks the Hudson River was once inhabited by the Wecquaesgeek Indians and called Chquaesgeck. Later it was called Lange Bergh (Long Hill) by Dutch settlers until the 17th century.Kuhn, Jonathan. \\"Fort Tryon Park\\" in , p.473 = 18th and 19th centuries = In the 18th century, only the southern portion of the island was settled by Europeans, leaving the rest of Manhattan largely untouched. Among the many unspoiled tracts of land was the highest spot on the island, which provided unsurpassed views of what would become the New York metropolitan area.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.448 When the Revolutionary War came to New York, the British had the upper hand. General George Washington and troops from his Continental Army camped on the high ground, calling it Fort Washington, to monitor the advancing Redcoats. The Continental Army retreated from its location after their defeat on November 16, 1776, in the Battle of Fort Washington.\\"The Battle of Fort Washington, Revolutionary War\\" on AmericanRevolution.org The British took the position and renamed it Fort Knyphausen in honor of the leader of the Hessians, who had taken a major part in the British victory.Jenkins, Stephen (1911) The Greatest Street in the World: The Story of Broadway, Old and New, from the Bowling Green to Albany, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. p.36 Their location was in the spot now called Bennett Park. Fort Washington had been established as an offensive position to prevent British vessels from sailing north on the Hudson River. Fort Lee, across the river, was its twin, built to assist in the defense of the Hudson Valley. 181st Street from Plaza Lafayette Not far from the fort was the Blue Bell Tavern, located on an intersection of Kingsbridge Road, where Broadway and West 181st Street intersect today, on the southeastern corner of modern- day Hudson Heights.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.232 On July 9, 1776, when New York's Provincial Congress assented to the Declaration of Independence, \\"A rowdy crowd of soldiers and civilians ('no decent people' were present, one witness said later) ... marched down Broadway to Bowling Green, where they toppled the statue of George III erected in 1770. The head was put on a spike at the Blue Bell Tavern ... \\" The tavern was later used by Washington and his staff when the British evacuated New York, standing in front of it as they watched the American troops march south to retake New York.Renner, James (2007) Images of America: Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill. Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing. By 1856 the first recorded home had been built on the site of Fort Washington. The Moorewood residence was there until the 1880s. The property was purchased by Richard Carman and sold to James Gordon Bennett Sr. for a summer estate in 1871. Bennett's descendants later gave the land to the city to build a park honoring the Revolutionary War encampment. Bennett Park is a portion of that land. Lucius Chittenden, a New Orleans merchant, built a home on land he bought in 1846 west of what is now Cabrini Boulevard and West 187th Street.Feirstein, p.170 It was known as the Chittenden estate by 1864.

Fort Tryon The beginning of this section of Washington Heights as a neighborhood-within-a-neighborhood seems to have started around this time, in the years before World War II. One scholar refers to the area in 1940 as \\"Fort Tryon\\" and \\"the Fort Tryon area.\\" In 1989, Steven M. Lowenstein wrote, \\"The greatest social distance was to be found between the area in the northwest, just south of Fort Tryon Park, which was, and remains, the most prestigious section ...

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 23. On July 6, 2010, he was arrested again in Bannu, Pakistan, for allegedly rejoining the Taliban. He was believed to be a commander in a group associated with bombings. Time magazine article In October 2002, Issa Khan was the subject of a Time magazine article. Khan's first letter from Guantanamo, received by his family almost a year after his capture, was one of the first letters from a Guantanamo captive to be publicized. It began His family described Khan as a homeopathic doctor, who had traveled to Mazari Sharif with his new wife to show off their new baby to her family there, when war struck, and he was rounded up Northern Alliance forces because he was a member of the Pashtun ethnic group. Human Rights Watch letter Human Rights Watch issued a \\"Letter to President General Pervez Musharraf\\" calling on the Bush administration to \\"release detainees who were Taliban soldiers or who have no connection to al-Qaeda, and who are not being prosecuted for war crimes or other serious international offenses.\\" The letter referred to Khan as a \\"homeopathic doctor from Bannu District in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan who, American and Pakistani officials have privately admitted to Human Rights Watch, has no connection to the Taliban or al-Qaeda.\\" Repatriation and Pakistani detention Following his repatriation, he was imprisoned and investigated by Pakistani security authorities. Khan has been granted a kind of extrajudicial conditional release by Pakistani officials. Khan's conditional release is not like parole, granted by judicial authorities, following a conviction during a trial, as neither the American or Pakistani authorities ever laid any criminal charges against him, or granted him a trial. According to an article in the January 7, 2006, edition of the Houston Chronicle Khan says he has considered committing suicide because the Pakistani government continues to monitor him. McClatchy interview On June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published an article on each of 66 former Guantanamo captives they interviewed. mirror Issa Khan was one of the captives interviewed. In the interview Khan acknowledged that his father-in-law was a Taliban appointed judge. He was repatriated to Pakistani custody in September 2004‚Äîthat is, while the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were in process. His Pakistani interrogators told him his wife had been killed in 2001, and that his infant sone had disappeared. McClatchy reporters had been allowed access to his Pakistani security dossier, which stated he had been cleared of suspicion of involvement with the Taliban. Issa Khan reported he was captured by Pakistani police at a road-block‚Äînot on a battlefield. He reported being abused, both by his initial Pakistani captors and by Americans in Afghanistan. He reported that female interrogators told him they were smearing their menses on him. He reported that he and other captives retaliated by throwing their bodily fluids on some of the guards. Pentagon claim he had \\"reengaged in terrorism\\" On May 20, 2009, the New York Times, citing an unreleased Pentagon document, reported that Department of Defense officials claimed Isa Khan was one of 74 former Guantanamo captives who was \\"suspected\\" of having \\"engaged in terrorism or militant activity.\\" On May 27, 2009, the Defense Intelligence Agency published a fact sheet entitled \\"Former Guantanamo Detainee Terrorism Trends\\" that named Isa Khan as being suspected of having \\"reengaged in terrorism\\". According to the document he was suspected of an \\"association with Tehrik-i-Taliban\\".

Iofan's House on the Embankment, present day  Background  Born in Odessa, Iofan graduated in 1916 from Italy's Regio Istituto Superiore di Belle Arti (now Accademia di Belle Arti) in Rome with a degree in architecture, initially following the Neoclassical tradition. His first major work was a Barvikha sanatorium for the Party elite (1929), which introduced him to clients at the top of the state. In 1931, Iofan completed the elite block-wide House on the Embankment (official name –î–æ–º –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞, Government Building). The structure, containing 505 apartments,House on the Embankment web site: domna.ru two theaters and retail stores, became an iconic example of early Stalinism. Boris Iofan was a lifelong resident of this building.  Palace of Soviets  Iofan's entry to the Palace of Soviets contest won in 1932 (first prize was actually split among three competing entries, but eventually Joseph Stalin awarded the job to Iofan). His design was awarded a gold medal during the 1937 International Exposition dedicated to Art and Technology in Modern Life in Paris. Church of Christ the Savior, a monument initiated by Alexander I (and consecrated by Alexander III), was razed for construction of the palace (before the contest began). Construction proceeded slowly; in response to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941 construction work was halted at a time when the structure's steel frame stood 50 metres high. The frame was subsequently disassembled and scrapped for weapons production. In 1958, the Moscow Swimming Pool was erected at the site, after construction of the palace was abandoned. This open-air pool was eventually shut down and the cathedral was rebuilt at the same location in 1994-1995. Iofan designed Soviet Pavilions at World Expo in Paris (1937) and New York (1939). Later, he bid for the Moscow State University skyscraper project in Moscow (1947); the job was awarded to Lev Rudnev. In his later years, Iofan was awarded the title of People's Architect of the USSR (October 20, 1970).–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ø–æ—á–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è ¬´–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –°–°–°–†¬ª, on www.promedali.ru (accessed in September 2010) Projects *1925 - Building on Rusakovskaya Street, 7 *1927 - Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, Administrative building, Kolkhoz building *1928-1931 - First House of Soviets of the CEC and SNK of the USSR (House on the Embankment) *1931 - Designing the Palace of Soviets *1935 - Sanatorium of the Medical and Sanitary Management of the Kremlin \\"Barvikha\\" (now clinical sanatorium \\"Barvikha\\") *1937 - Pavilion of the international exhibition in Paris and the idea of the sculpture by V.

Markov logic networks generalize first-order logic, in the sense that, in a certain limit, all unsatisfiable statements have a probability of zero, and all tautologies have probability one. History Work in this area began in 2003 by Pedro Domingos and Matt Richardson, and they began to use the term MLN to describe it. Description Briefly, it is a collection of formulas from first-order logic, to each of which is assigned a real number, the weight. Taken as a Markov network, the vertices of the network graph are atomic formulas, and the edges are the logical connectives used to construct the formula. Each formula is considered to be a clique, and the Markov blanket is the set of formulas in which a given atom appears. A potential function is associated to each formula, and takes the value of one when the formula is true, and zero when it is false. The potential function is combined with the weight to form the Gibbs measure and partition function for the Markov network. The above definition glosses over a subtle point: atomic formulas do not have a truth value unless they are grounded and given an interpretation; that is, until they are ground atoms with a Herbrand interpretation. Thus, a Markov logic network becomes a Markov network only with respect to a specific grounding and interpretation; the resulting Markov network is called the ground Markov network. The vertices of the graph of the ground Markov network are the ground atoms. The size of the resulting Markov network thus depends strongly (exponentially) on the number of constants in the domain of discourse. Inference The goal of inference in a Markov logic network is to find the stationary distribution of the system, or one that is close to it; that this may be difficult or not always possible is illustrated by the richness of behaviour seen in the Ising model. As in a Markov network, the stationary distribution finds the most likely assignment of probabilities to the vertices of the graph; in this case, the vertices are the ground atoms of an interpretation. That is, the distribution indicates the probability of the truth or falsehood of each ground atom. Given the stationary distribution, one can then perform inference in the traditional statistical sense of conditional probability: obtain the probability P(AB) that formula A holds, given that formula B is true. Inference in MLNs can be performed using standard Markov network inference techniques over the minimal subset of the relevant Markov network required for answering the query. These techniques include Gibbs sampling, which is effective but may be excessively slow for large networks, belief propagation, or approximation via pseudolikelihood.

Playlists consisted of links to Vorbis, MP3, WMA, RealAudio and/or other audio files on the web.

Copyright issues  Although Webjay did not host any files, it made an effort to avoid potential copyright disputes by removing links upon request of the content or host owner. The site's copyright policy included this statement:  Explanations by third parties  A July 15, 2004 story in The New York Times titled \\"Multimedia Scrapbooks to Share\\" described the site this way: A March 30, 2004 story in Jon Udell's blog titled \\"Blogs + playlists = collaborative listening\\" described the site this way: An April 22, 2004 story in The New York Times described the site this way:  Relationship to XSPF  The XSPF playlist format evolved from Webjay in the following way. Webjay predated the common practice (in 2008) of having a web playlist be edited and managed by a single site, then exported to other sites with a Flash widget that can play the playlist. Playlists on Webjay were played by generating a text file in one of a variety of common playlist formats, including ASX, SMIL, and M3U. The playlist file contained a list of URLs of multimedia files from different third party sites. The playlists were downloaded to a client-side media player like Windows Media Player, RealAudio, QuickTime, or Winamp. The client-side media player would play the URLs one after another, giving the cumulative impression of a single continuous stream. After the XSPF playlist format came into existence and before any media players could render an XSPF playlist, Webjay added the ability to generate an XSPF file for any playlists on the site. It did not provide a player, only playlists, so at first the files could not be played. An independent developer created an XSPF player known as XSPF Musicplayer. It did not provide playlists. Webjay and XSPF Musicplayer were independent products that were only useful as a pair. Another independent developer created a web site to put Webjay and XSPF Musicplayer together. This site was called \\"Webjay Wizard\\". Because XSPF Musicplayer is written in Flash it can be used in the browser without launching a client-side multimedia player like Windows Media Player. As a result, it was used to embed music in pages on social networking sites such as Myspace, as a Web widget. This created popular demand for XSPF. Other XSPF players came into being to compete with XSPF Musicplayer. When Webjay was closed down by Yahoo!, other XSPF editing and generation tools took its place. XSPF continued to exist.

It, along with OR 99W, makes up a split of OR 99 in the northern part of the state. This split existed when the route was U.S. Route 99, when the two branches were U.S. 99W and U.S. 99E. (Another such split occurred in California, but with the decommissioning of U.S. 99, that state elected to rename its U.S. 99W as Interstate 5, rather than preserve the directional suffix.) Currently, OR 99E and OR 99W do not reconvene at a northern junction in Oregon; OR 99W has been truncated from its original route, and ends in Downtown Portland, several miles south of its original northern terminus; nor is OR 99 (without a suffix) signed anywhere in Portland. History Route description Oregon 99E, 211 and 214 Direction Sign OR 99E has its southern terminus in Junction City. Almost immediately after leaving the city limits the route crosses the Willamette River, and serves Willamette Valley towns such as Harrisburg and Tangent. North of Tangent, the route enters the city of Albany and serves as a main thoroughfare through town (for about a mile, OR 99E shares an alignment with US 20). At the northern end of Albany, OR 99E joins I-5. OR 99E remains co-signed with I-5 until Salem where it again splits off from the interstate, serving many towns in northern Marion County. (A business route through Salem, OR 99E Business, consists of a section of OR 22 and the Salem Parkway; a previous alignment of OR 99E along Commercial Street, Fairgrounds Road, and Portland Road is often erroneously referred to as \\"99E\\" even though it is no longer part of the Oregon Route system). North of Salem, OR 99E serves the northern Willamette Valley, passing through cities such as Woodburn, Hubbard, and Canby, before entering the Portland metro area in Oregon City. The stretch between Canby and Oregon City is notorious for frequent and serious accidents. Starting in Oregon City, and continuing through the suburban communities of Gladstone, Oak Grove and Milwaukie, OR 99E is known as McLoughlin Boulevard (after fur trader John McLoughlin). The road crosses the John McLoughlin Bridge just south of Gladstone. North of Milwaukie (and an interchange with OR 224), OR 99E is a high-capacity urban expressway. In Portland, OR 99E continues as the McLoughlin Boulevard expressway until passing beneath the Ross Island Bridge (US 26), where it runs on the couplet of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (formerly Union Avenue) and Grand Avenue. It is the main north-south arterial through the central east side of the city. North of NE Broadway, OR 99E continues as MLK Jr. Boulevard and passes through several Northeast Portland Neighborhoods until its terminus at an interchange with I-5 and OR 120 in Delta Park, just south of the Columbia River crossing. (The interchange also involves Interstate Avenue, which was the prior route of OR 99W before the latter route was truncated). Major intersections :Note: mileposts do not reflect actual mileage due to realignments. Not all interchanges are shown on the I-5 overlap; for a full list see the I-5 exit list.

The three men each arrange with a clerk at a local store to be smuggled to Kuwait by a driver. The men are treated gruffly and are humiliated by the process. Once they finally arrange for travel, they are forced to ride in the back of the truck across the desert on their way to Kuwait. At several check points, the men hide in a large, empty, water tank in the stifling mid- day heat as the driver arranges paperwork to get through. After going through the last check point, within easy driving distance of the travelers' ultimate goal of Kuwait, the driver opens the tank to let the men out only to find they have died. Men in the Sun has been translated into many languages. Its description of the hardships and insecurity of Palestinian refugee life, and its political and psychological subtext (subtly criticizing corruption, political passivity and defeatism within Arab and Palestinian society) affected the Arab cultural and political debate of the time. It also uses modernist narrative structures and storytelling methods. Men in the Sun has been filmed as al-Makhduun (The Deceived or The Dupes), by Egyptian director Tawfiq Saleh.Yaqub, p. 121 The ending of the 1972 film was altered to show the three Palestinians beating on the walls of their hiding place as they suffocate. This ending was intended to reflect the political reality at a time when resistance movements had been established in the wake of the 1967 war. Men in the Sun was originally published in 1962. In the novella, the Palestinians die in silence. Radio artist Joe Frank mentions Men in the Sun in his show 'Another country, part 1', the version in which they die in silence.

A wide variety of rice cakes exist in many different cultures in which rice is eaten, and are particularly prevalent in Asia. Common variations include cakes made with rice flour, those made from ground rice, and those made from whole grains of rice compressed together or combined with some other binding substance. Rice cakes usually comes in various type(e.g. Crunchy, soggy,etc). Types of rice cakes by region Types of rice cake include: =Cambodian= Num Plae Ai (·ûï·üí·ûõ·üÇ·û¢·û∂·ûô) Khmer sticky rice balls with coconut topping *Ansom chek is a banana leaf sticky rice cake. It is served all year long but it is most prevalent during Bun Pchum Ben or \\"Ancestors' Day\\" festival. It is served either with a banana filling or pork fat strips and beans then they are wrapped with layers of banana leaf and steamed to perfection and then served. *Num Kom is steamed sweet sticky rice flour cake filled with palm sugar, freshly grated coconut and roasted sesame seeds.It is traditionally made and eaten on Memorial day for ancestors (Bun Pchum ben/Don-ta), Visak( Buddha birthday) and especially Cambodian New Year(Bon chol thnam tmey). It takes the shape of a pyramid to represent Buddhist pagoda towers. *Num Krok is sticky rice cake that is mixture of rice flour, coconut milk, chopped shallots and a little salt, dipped in fish and chili sauce and sometimes palm sugar.It is made with an iron pan. *Num Plae Ai(·ûï·üí·ûõ·üÇ·û¢·û∂·ûô) is sticky rice balls with palm sugar on the inside and rolled in fresh coconut for a beautiful cover. *Num Ah-Kor (·ûì·üÜ·û¢·û∂·ûÄ·üÑ·ûö) is one of the most popular Cambodian/Khmer dessert. It is a dessert that is served during khmer new year and festivities. It is made with rice flour and topped with fresh shaved coconut. It comes in many colors. *Nom Chak-Kachan also known as sticky rice layer cake. It is made with sticky rice, tapioca flours, and coconut milk. It comes in a number of colors with green and yellow layers being the most popular. =Chinese= nin gou cake, pan- fried * Nian gao includes many varieties, all made from glutinous rice that is pounded or ground into a paste and, depending on the variety, may simply be molded into shape or cooked again to settle the ingredient. * Tangyuan is made by mixing glutinous rice flour with a small amount of water to form balls and is then cooked and served in boiling water. * Erkuai literally means \\"ear piece\\", a reference to the shape of one of its common forms. Erkuai is generally stir-fried or grilled and rolled around a youtiao. *White sugar sponge cake is a steamed rice cake that is typically consumed in square pieces or triangles. * Ê±üÁ±≥Á≥ï literally \\"river rice cake\\" =Filipino= Puto, a traditional Filipino steamed rice cake Bibingka, a traditional Filipino rice cake baked in a clay pot Filipino puso rice cakes, made from glutinous rice cooked in woven pouches of various designs, are eaten with savory dishes Rice cakes are a common snack in the Philippines and Filipinos have created many different kinds. In Filipino, desserts (mostly rice-derived ones) are known as kakanin, derived from the word kanin, meaning \\"prepared rice\\". Rice cakes were formerly known by the general term tinapay (literally meaning \\"fermented with tapay\\"), but that term is now restricted to bread in modern Filipino. Nevertheless, two general categories of rice cakes remain: puto for steamed rice cakes, and bibingka for baked rice cakes. Both are usually prepared using galapong, a viscous rice paste derived from grinding uncooked glutinous rice that has been soaked overnight. Galapong is usually fermented, as the old term implies. Some examples of traditional Filipino dessert rice cakes include: * Ampaw is a Filipino sweet puffed rice cake. It is traditionally made with sun- dried leftover cooked white rice that is fried and coated with syrup. * Baye baye is a type of rice cake made from coconut and ground green rice (pinipig) or ground corn kernels * Bibingka is a type of rice cake made with galapong and coconut milk or water, with its bottom lined with banana leaves. It is traditionally baked using specially made clay ovens and preheated charcoal. * Biko, also called sinukmani or wadjit, is a type of rice cake made from coconut milk, sugar, and whole glutinous rice grains * Espasol is made from rice flour cooked in coconut milk and sweetened coconut strips, dusted with toasted rice flour * Kutsinta is a steamed rice cake (puto) made with rice flour, brown sugar, lye, and freshly grated mature coconut meat * Mache (also spelled matse) are boiled glutinous rice balls flavored with pandan and coconut * Masi are boiled or steamed glutinous rice balls with a peanut and muscovado filling * Moche (also spelled mochi or muchi) are boiled glutinous rice balls with bean paste fillings served with hot sweetened coconut milk * Palitaw is a boiled rice cake disk covered with freshly grated mature coconut meat and sugar * Panyalam is similar to bibingka but is fried instead of baked. It is popular among Muslim Filipinos and the Lumad people of Mindanao. * Puto is a general term for steamed rice cakes popular all over the country with numerous variations * Puto bumbong is a steamed rice cake (puto) cooked in bamboo tubes and characteristically deep purple in color * Salukara is similar to bibingka but is cooked as a large flat pancake traditionally greased with pork lard * Sapin-sapin is made from glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, sugar, water, and coconut flakes sprinkled on top. Its distinguishing layered appearance is achieved by using food coloring * Suman is made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, and often steamed in banana leaves * Tupig, a rice cake made from galapong, coconut milk, sugar, and young coconut wrapped in banana leaves and baked directly on charcoals Some of these rice cakes can be considered savory. Putong bigas, the most common type of puto, for instance, is traditionally paired with the savory pig's blood stew dinuguan. Bibingka galapong can also be topped with meat or eggs. Aside from these, non-dessert rice cakes eaten as accompaniment to savory meals also exist, the most widespread being the puso. *Binalot is a generic term for rice with various accompanying dishes wrapped in banana leaves *Kiping is a thin wafer-like rice cakes uniquely molded from real leaves. Usually eaten dipped with vinegar, but can be eaten as a dessert with sugar. *Pastil is a packed rice dish with shredded beef, chicken, or fish wrapped in banana leaves *Puso is a widespread class of rice cakes made from glutinous rice cooked inside woven pouches of various designs. These are differentiated from other non-dessert rice rice cakes wrapped in leaves, in that the leaves in puso are woven into complex designs, not simply wrapped around the rice cakes. =Indian= Idli, a south Indian savory cake * Patoleo are sweet rice cakes steamed in turmeric leaves consisting of a filling of coconut and palm jaggery. These are prepared by the Konkani people during their festivities. * Pitha, in the Bengali, Assamese and Oriya cuisines, is usually a thin-flat cake prepared from a batter made with soaked and ground rice. They are usually cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan and could be fried in oil, roasted over a slow fire or baked and rolled over a hot plate once made. In West Bengal and Bangladesh, special pithas are made in different processes such as steaming or stuffing, the bhapa and puli pithas being examples respectively. Special festivals where pithas are generally made include Nabanna in Bengali culture, Bihu in Assam and many festivals in East India. * Idli in South Indian cuisine. The cakes are usually two to three inches in diameter and are made by steaming a batter, which is fermented overnight, consisting of black lentils (de-husked), and rice approximately 1:2 ratio with a bit of salt. Usually eaten with coconut chutney or sambhar - a type of lentil soup flavoured with tamarind. * Puttu in South Indian cuisine, consists of firm cylinders of steamed ground rice with layers of coconut. =Indonesian= Lontong, popular in Indonesia and Malaysia, made of compressed rice rolled into a banana leaf As a food staple In Indonesia rice cakes can be plain and bland tasting, and are often treated as a food staple, as an alternative to steamed rice. * Burasa, a type of rice dumpling cooked with coconut milk packed inside a banana leaf pouch. It is a delicacy of the Bugis and Makassar people of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and often consumed as a staple to replace steamed rice or ketupat. It is similar to lontong, but with richer flavour acquired from coconut milk. * Ketupat, or packed rice is a type of rice dumpling of Indonesia. Also can be found in Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. It is made from rice that has been wrapped in a Rhombus or kite shaped woven palm leaf pouch and boiled. As the rice cooks, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the ketupat its characteristic form and texture of a rice dumpling. Ketupat is usually eaten with rendang or served as an accompaniment to satay or gado-gado. Ketupat is also traditionally served by Malays at open houses on festive occasions such as Idul Fitri (Hari Raya Aidilfitri). During Idul Fitri in Indonesia, ketupat is often served with opor ayam (chicken in coconut milk), accompanied with spicy soy powder. * Lontong, popular in Indonesia and also can be found in Malaysia, is made of compressed rice that is then cut into small cakes. It is traditionally made by boiling the rice until it is partially cooked and packing it tightly into a rolled-up banana leaf. The leaf is secured and cooked in boiling water for about 90 minutes. Once the compacted rice has cooled, it can be cut up into bite-sized pieces. The dish is usually served cold or at room temperature with sauce-based dishes such as gado-gado and salads, although it can be eaten as an accompaniment to other dishes such as Satay and curries. * Nasi himpit, can be found in Indonesia and Malaysia. Unlike ketupat or lontong, nasi himpit is not cooked in a wrapping. Instead, the already boiled or steamed rice is pounded in a mortar into paste which is then molded and cut into a cube before eating. It's often eaten with Sayur lodeh or Soto. As a snack Numerous types of Indonesian kue (traditional cake) are made using glutinous rice or rice flour. They can be sweet or savoury. Varieties include: * Arem-arem, a smaller lontong filled with vegetables and meat. * Klepon, balls of glutinous rice flour filled with gula jawa (red palm sugar) and boiled or steamed. Afterwards the balls are rolled in grated coconut. In Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, they are called \\"onde-onde\\". *Kue lapis, a layered colorful cake made of glutinous rice flour, coconut and sugar. * Lemper, a savoury snack made of glutinous rice filled with chicken, fish or abon (meat floss). The meat filling is rolled inside the rice in a fashion very similar to Chinese zongzi. A variant of lemper which instead of being wrapped with a banana leaf is wrapped inside of a thin egg omelette is called semar mendem. * Lepet, a sticky rice dumpling mixed with peanuts cooked with coconut milk and packed inside janur (young coconut leaf or palm leaf). It is a delicacy commonly found in Javanese and Sundanese cuisine and often consumed as snack. * Lupis, compressed glutinous rice served with grated coconut and coconut sugar syrup. * Nagasari or kue pisang, a traditional steamed cake made from rice flour, coconut milk and sugar and filled with slices of banana. *Putu, green pandan-colored rice flour filled with coconut sugar and steamed in bamboo cylinder. *Serabi, a type of pancake made from rice flour with coconut milk or just plain shredded coconut as an emulsifier. =Japanese= Mochi, a Japanese cake made from glutinous rice * Mochi is made of glutinous rice pounded into paste and molded into shape. In Japan it is traditionally made in a ceremony called mochitsuki. While also eaten year-round, mochi is a traditional food for the Japanese New Year and is commonly sold and eaten during that time. Mochi is also a prominent snack in Hawaii, Taiwan, Cambodia, and Thailand. * Senbei are a type of Japanese rice crackers, usually cooked by being baked or grilled, traditionally over charcoal. While being prepared they may be brushed with a flavoring sauce, often one made of soy sauce and mirin. They may then be wrapped with a layer of nori. Alternatively they may be flavored with salt or so-called \\"salad\\" flavoring. =Korean= Tteok, Korean rice cakes Steamed rice cake in an earthenware steamer was the oldest principal food for Koreans before sticky rice took over upon the invention of the iron pot.:ko:Îñ° Now, there are hundreds of different kinds of Korean rice cake or \\"tteok\\" eaten year round. In Korea, it is customary to eat tteok guk (tteok soup) on New Year's Day and sweet tteok at weddings and on birthdays. It is often considered a celebratory food and can range from rather elaborate versions or down to the plain- flavored tteok. Rice cakes are chosen for particular occasions depending on their color and the role they play in Korea's traditional yin-yang cosmology. * Tteok is a class of Korean cakes mostly made with glutinous rice flour (also known as sweet rice or chapssal). Tteok is usually divided into four categories: \\"Steamed tteok\\" (Ï∞åÎäî Îñ°, ), \\"Pounded tteok\\" (ÏπòÎäî Îñ°, ), \\"Boiled tteok\\" (ÏÇ∂Îäî Îñ° ) and \\"Pan-fried tteok\\" (ÏßÄÏßÄÎäî Îñ° ). * Sirutteok is one kind of steamed tteok made from rice (ÎßµÏåÄ, maepssal in Korean) or glutinous rice (Ï∞πÏåÄ chapssal) which are sometimes mixed together with other grains, beans (azuki beans or mung beans), sesame seeds, wheat flour, or starch. Fruits and nuts are used as subsidiary ingredients. * Injeolmi is an example of pounded tteok. The traditional preparation for pounded tteok is made by pounding rice or glutinous rice with utensils called jeolgu and jeolgutgongi or tteokme and anban. Injeolmi (tteok coated with bean powder), garaetteok (Í∞ÄÎûòÎñ° cylinder- shaped white tteok), jeolpyeon (Ï†àÌé∏ patterned tteok) and danja (Îã®Ïûê glutinous tteok ball coated with bean paste)‚Äù are commonly eaten pounded tteok. * Songpyeon and Bupyeon are rice cakes which have been molded into shape. There are dozens of these kinds of cakes in Korea. Some consist of glutinous rice flour dough and a sweet filling covered with gomul, a kind of powdered beans. *Kkultteok (ÍøÄÎñ°, literally \\"honey tteok\\") is made by mixing honey with glutinous rice powder and sieving it with chestnuts, jujubes, pine nuts, etc.https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=5701248&cid;=48183&categoryId;=48278 Kkul tteok is similar to songpyeon in shape, but smaller in size. * Hwajeon are small sweet pancakes made of glutinous rice flour and flower petals from seasonal blooms, such as the Korean azalea, chrysanthemum, or rose. * Tteokbokki is a stir-fried dish made with garaetteok and commonly sold by street vendors. It is usually seasoned with gochujang (chili paste) but can also be served with a sauce based on soy sauce and commonly contains fish cake, boiled eggs, and green onion. *Tteokguk is a soup that is eaten in Seollal. It contains such ingredients as sliced tteok, anchovy, green onion, and eggs. *Mujigae-tteok or 'rainbow rice cake' is a layered tteok of different colors resembling a rainbow. Colors are typically light red, yellow, and green. =Sri Lankan= *Idli, originating in South India, it is a savoury rice cake that is popularly eaten for breakfast. *Puttu, originating in South India, it is widely consumed throughout the country. It is a cylinder made out of steamed ground rice and coconut. *Seenakku, a rice cake made out of glutinous rice and served with grated coconut, it derives from the Chinese nian gao. =Taiwanese= * Tainan bowl rice cake (√≥a‚Åø-k√≥e, Á¢óÁ≤ø) has its origins in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan. The dish is made by steaming glutinous rice once, then putting toppings in it and steaming it again. =Vietnamese= Steamed B√°nh b√≤, a sweet, chewy Vietnamese sponge cake made from rice flour * B√°nh b√®o is a variety of small steamed rice cake or rice pancake typically featuring a dimple in the center, which is filled with savory ingredients including chopped dried or fresh shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and oil. * B√°nh b√≤ is a sweet, chewy sponge cake made from rice flour, water, sugar, and yeast. * B√°nh ƒë√∫c is a cake made from non-glutinous rice flour (although corn flour is also used in northern Vietnam). In the north it is typically garnished with savory ingredients such as ground pork, t√¥m ch·∫•y (grilled ground shrimp), fried onions, sesame seeds, salt, peanuts, lime juice, and soy sauce or fish sauce. In the south, it is served as a dessert, and takes the form of gelatinous blocks that are often colored green by the addition of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf extract. It is cooked by boiling the ingredients and allowing them to cool, solidifying into a jelly-like sheet that is then cut into blocks. * B√°nh ch∆∞ng is made from glutinous rice, mung bean, pork and other ingredients. B√°nh t√©t is much the same but cut in a circular form, and consumed in celebration of the Vietnamese holiday T·∫øt. * B√°nh t·ªï is a rice cake made out of glutinous rice and is related to the Chinese nian gao. =In other cuisines= Bangladeshi style rice cake, originally known as Bhapa Pitha, eaten with molasses as a sweetener Tahchin or Persian baked Saffron rice cake. Decorated with Barberries, Almond and Pistachio slices * Chwee kueh, (literally \\"water rice cake\\") is a type of steamed rice cake, a cuisine of Singapore and Johor. It is made by mixing rice flour and water to form a slightly viscous mixture, which is then placed in small cup-shaped containers that look like saucers and steamed, forming a characteristic bowl-like shape when cooked. The rice cakes are topped with diced preserved radish and served with chilli sauce. Chwee kueh is a popular breakfast item in Singapore and Johor. * Puffed rice cakes, popular in North America and other Western countries, are made with puffed rice, a puffed grain usually created by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam, though the method of manufacture varies widely. The puffed grains are then bonded together by a wide variety of methods in the form of a cake. They are popular among young children and among dieters as a lower calorie substitute for bread, crackers, or chips. They may be plain, salted, flavored or half coated in chocolate or yogurt. * Rijsttaart and Rijstevlaai in Dutch and Belgian cuisine are kinds of rice pie, with the filling of mixed rice, sugar, eggs and milk. * In Italian cuisine, specifically the cuisine of Tuscany, torte di riso are rice cakes sometimes eaten as a substantial dessert at the end of a meal. * In Iranian cuisine, Tahchin or Persian baked rice cake is a type of steamed rice cake made with yogurt, saffron, eggs, and chicken fillets. * In Nigerian Cuisine, Masa is a rice cake similar to a pan fried rice cake in an oval shape eaten with different stews, and is from the Northern Region particularly the Hausa ethnic group. * Vitumbua is a coastal East- African Swahili dish made of rice or rice flout and coconut eaten mostly for breakfast.

The Waynesboro Outlet Village, later rebranded Waynesboro Village, was an outdoor outlet mall in Waynesboro, Virginia, as one of Waynesboro's first attempts to make the town a shopping destination. In its heyday, the facility housed factory outlet stores, and in later years housed a combination of outlet stores and offices for nonprofit organizations. Between its 1987 opening and spring 2006 closing, retail tenants have included Bannister Shoe, Bass Shoes, Bugle Boy, Capacity, Christmas Goose, Corning-Revere, Crafters Corner, Fannie Farmer, L'eggs-Hanes-Bali, Liz Claiborne, Petal Pushers, Sam's Factory Outlet, The Paper Factory, The Ribbon Outlet, Royal Dalton, Tile Visions, Virginia MetalCrafters and Westport Ltd. Non-traditional tenants have included the Artisans Center of Virginia, Borg-Warner Services, Computer Redistribution Team, Dance Augusta, Northrop Grumman Information Technology and One Child at a Time (OCAT). Demolition Building 7 burns to the ground as part of a fire department training exercise. The Waynesboro Outlet Village was demolished during August 2006 to make way for a new retail center, with the first new tenants planned to open in the fall of 2007. Existing tenants were required to vacate their spaces by June 19, 2006. While some buildings in the complex were demolished conventionally, others were burned to the ground by the Waynesboro Fire Department, which conducted training exercises in the buildings. Former Fire chief Charles Scott described the situation as \\"win- win\\", as the fire department is able to conduct valuable training, while the new developers are able to save on demolition costs. Redevelopment The facility that replaced the Waynesboro Outlet Village is called \\"Waynesboro Town Center\\". Waynesboro city officials confirmed in June 2006 that the shopping center would be anchored by Target and Kohl's. Target opened on October 9, 2007 as the first of several new stores.

For example, \\"grenade spamming\\" is the act of a player throwing many grenades in succession into an area. In fighting games, one form of spamming would be to execute the same offensive maneuver or combo many times in succession. Types of spam =Chat spamming= Chat spamming is the repetition of a word or line typed out by a player using a game's chat system. Most games have some form of text messaging built for in-game communication, there is little to stop a frustrated player from flooding a server with text in the same way a user can flood a chat room. Some servers enforce rules regarding spamming, possibly resulting in players being kicked or banned. Some games allow text to be turned off or mute the player after a limited number of messages at the same time, hence nullifying this form of spamming. People usually \\"Copy and Paste\\" or use spambots. Games that utilize Quake's chat color support can provide potential positive usage such as attracting brief attention to short-spammed preset messages which can be color coded based on the context they are to be used, allowing the team communicate and receive better situational awareness to critical situations. =Grenade spamming= Grenade spamming or 'nade spamming involves throwing multiple grenades into an area. Grenade spamming can have two distinct subgenres. The first occurs when a single player will repeatedly acquire grenades (usually with the assistance of hotkeys) and throw them without moving. The second version involves a player or group of players all throwing large numbers of grenades into an area. Grenade spamming has the effect of real-life artillery barrages, suppressing an area of the map and killing any characters caught within the spammed zone. When multiple players spam the same area, it is near- impossible for the opposing players to avoid having their avatars wounded or killed, and this effectively denies that area to enemies. In objective-based, or flag capture games like Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory or Battlefield 4, Battlefield 3, grenade spamming is also used to keep the enemy from passing through a needed passage, or to spam the objective itself while allies perform a flank attack on the pinned opponents. This presents some problems in team-based attack-and-defense maps, where the defending team may have a (deliberately designed) strong defensive position from which to spam. In Starsiege: Tribes, a group of dedicated mortar spammers can confine an entire team within an enclosed area (such as their own base) indefinitely. Usually, victimized players will simply quit the server when this happens. Spamming grenades in Tremulous often has significant consequences such as obliterating the player's own base if friendly fire is allowed, and if done repetitively the user may get banned. In addition to throwing fragmentation or explosive grenades, players can also spam smoke grenades, which obscures or completely eliminates vision and often lags the server. Grenade spamming is often criticized as requiring little to no skill and often seen as \\"unfair\\" by some players, as it does not put the player in direct conflict. Some see spamming as a valid tactic that prevents the opposition grouping together or camping and that it is reasonable for more grenades to have a greater chance of eliminating opponents than just using one. Nonetheless, the tactic is a highly effective one, and recommended by some developers, such as Infinity Ward in their game Call of Duty 2. A variation of grenade spamming is noob tubing, the act of simply having a grenade or rocket launcher equipped (more commonly grenade launcher) and simply shooting in the general direction of your foe in hopes the splash damage will kill or injure them. =Weapon spamming= Apart from grenades, \\"spam\\" can also describe spray and pray tactics with firearms. In its most general definition, weapon spamming involves using a large amount of ammunition irrespective of having any visible targets. While rapid automatic fire is often desirable against multiple targets or for suppression purposes, many gaming communities will frown on the reliance on automatic fire. The issue is most evident in games with light, fast automatic weapons and plenty of ammunition, such as light machine guns, allowing players to run around maps with the trigger held down and usually being able to score many points before being killed. While this style of gameplay often exposes players to direct conflict, as the style is largely based on luck, players relying solely on spam tactics are often looked down upon for their apparent lack of skill. However, some differentiation is made between weapon spamming against invisible targets (identified by sound, for example) and simple blind firing with the hopes of randomly hitting a target. Three category spamming, (most commonly practiced in games like Quake, Doom, and Unreal Tournament) is the act of switching between three or more one-shot weapons very quickly, so you essentially have a fully automatic one-shot weapon. Nonetheless, spamming is seen as an important skill to possess even in competitive gaming circles, and some weapons are designed for the sole purpose of sustained rapid fire. Some games provide weapon feedback (making the gun rise) or decrease the shot accuracy for each bullet in a burst, hence encouraging controlled fire. Limiting ammunition availability, or keeping the maximum amount a player can hold low, also encourages controlled firing. Similarly in Team Fortress 2, the Heavy Weapons Guy class has a very large, extremely high rate of fire minigun which is principally useful for suppressing enemies as well as killing careless players in large numbers, encouraging caution rather than recklessness around him. The weapon also holds an extremely large number of bullets and never requires reloading; however, it is highly inaccurate over long range, and firing it prevents the Heavy from quick movement, rendering him virtually stationary during sustained fire. According to developers at Valve, the weapon was intended to allow players without twitch-firing skills to engage in heavy firefights by developing a different combat skill-set based around predicting the start of combat and thus being in a defensive position and having the weapon ready in advance of enemies' arrival. Spamming certain weapons that require a large amount of game data to use or deploy, such as smoke grenades, is known to cause lag, mainly because the computer cannot easily render the effects. This can often be a problem, especially in a multiplayer setting. Many players look down on intentionally spamming data- intensive weapons with the goal of causing an unfair advantage. Similarly, weapon spamming can be used in games such as Counter Strike for the purposes of limiting the ability of opponents to hear anything other than the weapon being fired. =Move spamming= Move spamming in fighting games is very prevalent and its use is just as controversial as other forms of spamming. Move spamming involves using the same move or set of moves repeatedly. Usually these moves have high damage and/or speed, and can be difficult to block. They allow a player to inflict high damage with little effort, and prevent the opponent from getting into a good footing to attack. Like other forms of spamming, many players complain that it is unfair and diminishes the skill of the game, but experienced players will frequently use spamming to force their opponents into a different fighting style or a compromising position. The downside to move spamming is that it frequently leaves the player open to attack if they are not careful of when they spam a move. Frequent spamming of particular moves can also make a player very predictable, making the likelihood of an opponent falling victim to a spam move very low. Many games attempt to reduce move spamming by having long recovery times at the end of highly effective moves, giving characters effective counters to break spamming, as well as the damage of a move gradually lowering as it is used repeatedly. Many fighting games have moves that are easily spammed or are purposefully created to be spammed. Some moves have an \\"infinite\\" capability, where the move will continue to execute without stopping as long as the player is pressing the right button(s). The Super Smash Bros. series, for example, has multiple characters with the ability to enter an infinite move by rapidly tapping the A button. The character will then stand in place and begin a rapid flurry of attacks which only ceases if the player stops pressing the button. Since the attacker is stationary, the victim can simply move away from this attack. As such, infinite moves are frequently used when the victim is backed up against a wall to prevent their escape. Other moves can be chained into themselves, meaning that a move can be executed many times in a row without giving the opponent any time to react between hits. Many fighting games have moves like this, especially throws that allow a player to throw their opponent on the ground or against a wall, leaving them open to another throw before they can get to their feet. =Spawn spamming= One form of spam which is regarded as reprehensible by the gaming community as a whole is spawn spamming (more commonly known as spawn killing or more vulgarly baserape) (see spawn camping). As the name implies, this involves spamming an enemy's spawn point with weapon fire in an effort to kill the enemy as they spawn. Many games include some kind of spawn protection which prevents players being injured for a few seconds after spawning. Spawn points may be spammed using grenades, proximity mines, bullets, or other weaponry. =Sandbox spamming= In some sandbox-style open ended video games, players may spawn props, NPCs or other items. This is prevalent in the Half-Life 2 modification Garry's Mod, where it is possible to spawn numerous quantities of large, complex, or explosive items in order to crash the server. This is also common amongst Griefers in Second Life, who spam sandboxes (areas which allow anyone to spawn custom scripted items) with the intent of either slowing the FPS for other players, or crashing the server altogether. =Skill spamming= In role-playing video games spam usually takes the form of repeated use of one powerful or low-cost skill or spell. Buff, debuff, and condition spamming has the goal of making the player or his allies invulnerable, or the enemy too weak to react. More common is direct-damage spamming, where a single attack or spell, which has a low casting-cost and recharge time, is used continuously. One notable example is the spell 'Charged Bolt' in Diablo II. Its instantaneous cast and low cost allowed high level mages to cast the spell as quickly as they could press the casting key, dealing large amounts of damage in the process. Players can also spam high-end powerful skills, such as the 'Apocalypse' spell in Diablo or the Moonfire spell available to druids in World of Warcraft, which can be spammed to do high amounts of damage in a short period of time. Most games place heavy restrictions on the most powerful skills to prevent this kind of spamming, however, and it is often only possible through the use of cheats. There is significant overlap with skill spamming and the skill training in some MMORPGs which require a skill to be used to improve it. A player which uses the same skill over and over for this purpose is also said to be skill spamming. This is generally less frowned upon unless done in a highly populated area of the game where the accompanying graphical or sound effects will cause annoyance to others. =Unit spamming= In Real-time strategy video games spam usually takes the form of mass production of low cost, quick to create units, often from multiple production buildings. The goal of this tactic is to completely overwhelming your opponent's military and/or economy as they attempt to fight off a near continuous attack of large numbers of units, referred to as spam. This tactic is often used in combinations with certain in-game civilizations, or factions that have a built in proclivity to it such as the Goths in Age of Empires 2 or the Zerg in StarCraft, in StarCraft it is commonly referred to as Zergling.

Arkley first gained attention as a member (and leader) of Christian thrash metal band Seventh Angel. Signed to Under One Flag Seventh Angel released first album The Torment, and later Lament for the Weary album. After Seventh Angel split, Arkley formed Ashen Mortality adopting a doomier style mixed with mediaeval influences and some death vocals. Ashen Mortality released two self-released albums Sleepless Remorse and Your Caress. Arkley was briefly a member of the Australian doom outfit Paramaecium, and recorded the album A Time to Mourn with them. Ashen Mortality split in the autumn of 2004, playing their last gig on Halloween of that year. With two of the members in the final line-up of Ashen Mortality, Arkley formed My Silent Wake. My Silent Wake recorded a two- song demo in mid-2005, and the limited 100 copy run sold out almost immediately, and resulted in a record deal with indie label Bombworks Records. My Silent Wake released their first full-length album Shadow of Sorrow on Bombworks Records in spring 2006. Drawing on similar influences to Ashen Mortality, My Silent Wake is a more experimental progression for Arkley, with more open soundscape arrangements, but also a heavier aspect to the sound. My Silent Wake went on to record a further three albums and a split album with The Drowning. The band are still active. Arkley recorded two albums with the space rock band The Other Window. Arkley is also involved in a collaboration with the Visionaire frontman in a band called Century Sleeper who released Awaken in 2006. Seventh Angel later reformed in 2008, and released the album \\"The Dust of Years\\" in 2009, which saw the band take a more Death/Doom approach to their previous style. Since 2010 Arkley has also been involved with the industrial/darkwave band Attrition, contributing guitar. During this time, Arkley has also been active with My Silent Wake.

The practice is especially common in webcomics. Guest comics in webcomics Guest comics are usually requested of other artists by the usual creator of a webcomic. This may be done for a variety of reasons: * The creators are friends. * The usual creator will be unable to update the comic for some length of time, so they use guest comics to fill in the gap. * The usual creator enjoys (or thinks the audience will enjoy) seeing how other artists draw their characters. * A major phase of the plot has ended and the creator wants to take a break but keep the audience entertained. Guest comics are usually not meant to be canonical with the normal comic; their purpose is primarily entertainment. Sometimes, guest comics are not published as if they were regular comics, but instead exhibited on the comic's website in a separate section; e.g. White Ninja Comics. Webcomic creators that are in the same webcomic syndicate (e.g. Dayfree Press) frequently do guest comics for each other, sometimes simultaneously.

He was the prime minister of Thailand between 1976 and 1977. Subsequently, he was a member of the Privy Council until 2016.http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2520/A/132/1.PDF  Family and education  Thanin is a son of Hae and Pa-ob Kraivichien. He was born in Bangkok. His father was a Chinese-born merchant and owner of one of the biggest pawnshops in Bangkok. Thanin studied law at Thammasat University, graduating in 1948. He then went to the London School of Economics to continue with his law studies. He graduated in 1953, and in 1958 was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn. In Britain, he met Karen Anderson, a native of Denmark, whom he married. They have five children.  Judicial career  After he returned to Thailand in 1954, Thanin worked in the ministry of justice, becoming an associate judge. He rose quickly, finally becoming President of the Supreme Court of Thailand. Additionally, he taught law at Thammasat and Chulalongkorn universities and the Thai Bar Association. As an avocation, he published books that warned of the dangers of communism. After the democratic uprising against military dictatorship in 1973, Thanin was a member of the transitional legislative assembly appointed by the king. He became a member of the far- right anti-communist Nawaphon movement. He had a TV show in which he attacked communism, the students' movement, and progressive politicians.  Premiership  Prime Minister Thanin with US ambassador Charles S. Whitehouse in 1976 After the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976, the democratically elected prime minister Seni Pramoj was toppled by a military coup led by Admiral Sangad Chaloryu. Two days later, King Bhumibol Adulyadej appointed his favourite, Thanin, to be interim prime minister. Thanin insisted on selecting his cabinet himself and rejected most of the military junta's nominations. The military occupied only the positions of deputy prime minister and deputy minister of defence. Thanin led the first Thai cabinet in which women, Wimolsiri Chamnarnvej and Lursakdi Sampatisiri, held ministerial posts. Thanin was seen as honest and intelligent but also eminently ideological and politically extreme. After his taking office, he sent police special forces to notoriously liberal book shops, and ordered the confiscation and burning of 45,000 books, including works of Thomas More, George Orwell, and Maxim Gorky. Thanin announced that Thailand could return to democratic rule only after 12 years. The parliament was dissolved and all political parties outlawed. Thanin's crackdown on trade unions, progressive students' and farmers' associations drove activists into the underground structures of the Communist Party of Thailand. Instead of weakening the communists, it fuelled their armed struggle against the government. In March 1977, a group of younger army officers known as the \\"Young Turks\\", who had an interest in political matters, tried to topple Thanin. Their attempted coup failed. On 20 October 1977, however, Admiral Sangad again seized power and pressed Thanin to resign. The military justified their intervention because Thanin's government had divided the country and had virtually no public support, the economic situation had worsened, and people in general disagreed with such a long-term suspension of democracy.  Privy Councillor  King Bhumibol Adulyadej immediately appointed Thanin to his Privy Council. During the vacancy of the throne after Bhumibol's death on 13 October 2016, the former President of the Privy Council, Prem Tinsulanonda, served as regent and interim head of state. Thanin temporarily assumed the office of President of the Privy Council during this period. After King Vajiralongkorn's accession to the throne on 1 December 2016, Prem returned to his earlier position, while Thanin was not reappointed to the Privy Council at all.

It fully opposes the occupation. First organized in the Southern Oil Company Union in May 2003, Iraq's oil workers began organizing what became the General Union of Oil Employees (GUOE). They have pushed to keep Iraq's resources in the hands of Iraqis, while the union remained independent of any political parties and influences from the foreign occupation. It has not affiliated to either of the two major union federations of Iraq: the Iraqi Communist Party-connected Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions or the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq-influenced Federation of Workers Councils and Unions in Iraq, but it has worked with both groupings. As SOCU, the oil workers engaged in direct action to expel Baathist managers from oil facilities, occupation forces began moving in to attempt to take over administration of the industry. Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) led this, and was also militantly removed by the SOCU workers, along with subcontracted laborers. With threats to strike, the union was able to gain wage increases over what the United States-led occupation was willing to pay. KBR eventually took over much of the administration of the oil industry, although resistance in the form of strikes in June and August of that year, and blockades, continued. In cases where occupation forces threatened force, the SOCU workers warned that they would be met with armed resistance. In June 2004, the GUOE was formed from the workers of the major oil companies: Southern Oil Company, Southern Gas Company, Southern Refinery Company, Iraqi Drilling Company, the Oil Carrier Company, the Gas Packing Company, the Oil Production Company, the Oil Projects Company, and the Oil Pipe Lines Company. In May 2005, the GUOE organized a large conference against privatization with hundreds of unionists and representatives of other international groups. More strikes came in July and August, usually with outcomes favorable to the workers. In October, union president Hassan Jumaa Awad led the group to change its name to the Federation of Oil Unions of Iraq.

Ashliman, The House That Jack Built: an English nursery rhyme of folktale type 2035 Lyrics This is perhaps the most common set of modern lyrics: :This is the house that Jack built. :This is the malt that lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the maiden all forlorn :That milked the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the man all tattered and torn :That kissed the maiden all forlorn :That milked the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the judge all shaven and shorn :That married the man all tattered and torn :That kissed the maiden all forlorn :That milked the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the rooster that crowed in the morn :That woke the judge all shaven and shorn :That married the man all tattered and torn :That kissed the maiden all forlorn :That milked the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the farmer sowing his corn :That kept the rooster that crowed in the morn :That woke the judge all shaven and shorn :That married the man all tattered and torn :That kissed the maiden all forlorn :That milked the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. :This is the horse and the hound and the horn :That belonged to the farmer sowing his corn :That kept the rooster that crowed in the morn :That woke the judge all shaven and shorn :That married the man all tattered and torn :That kissed the maiden all forlorn :That milked the cow with the crumpled horn :That tossed the dog that worried the cat :That killed the rat that ate the malt :That lay in the house that Jack built. Some versions use \\"cheese\\" instead of \\"malt\\", \\"priest\\" instead of \\"judge\\", \\"cock\\" instead of \\"rooster\\", the older past tense form \\"crew\\" instead of \\"crowed\\", \\"shook\\" instead of \\"tossed\\", or \\"chased\\" in place of \\"killed\\". Also in some versions the horse, the hound, and the horn are left out and the rhyme ends with the farmer. Narrative technique This Is the House That Jack Built illustrated by Randolph Caldecott It is a cumulative tale that does not tell the story of Jack's house, or even of Jack who built the house, but instead shows how the house is indirectly linked to other things and people, and through this method tells the story of \\"The man all tattered and torn\\", and the \\"Maiden all forlorn\\", as well as other smaller events, showing how these are interlinked. Origins It has been argued that the rhyme is derived from an Aramaic (Jewish) hymn Chad Gadya (lit., \\"One Young Goat\\") in Sepher Haggadah, first printed in 1590; but although this is an early cumulative tale that may have inspired the form, the lyrics bear little relationship.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 229-32. It was suggested by James Orchard Halliwell that the reference to the \\"priest all shaven and shorn\\" indicates that the English version is probably very old, presumably as far back as the mid-sixteenth century. There is a possible reference to the song in The Boston New Letter of 12 April 1739 and the line: \\"This is the man all forlorn, &c;\\". However, it did not appear in print until it was included in Nurse Truelove's New- Year's-Gift, or the Book of Books for Children, printed in London in 1755.William S. Baring-Gould and Ceil Baring-Gould, The Annotated Mother Goose (New York, 1962), p. 25. It was printed in numerous collections in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Randolph Caldecott produced an illustrated version in 1878. Cherrington Manor, a timber-framed house in North East Shropshire, England, is reputed to be the actual house that Jack built. There is a former malt house in the grounds. Syntactic structure Each sentence in the story is an example of an increasingly deeply nested relative clause. The last version, \\"This is the horse...\\", would be quite difficult to untangle if the previous ones were not present. See the Noun Phrase for more details about postmodification of the noun phrase in this manner. References in popular culture Illustration by Walter Crane The rhyme continues to be a popular choice for illustrated children's books, with recent examples by Simms Taback and Quentin Blake showing how illustrators can introduce a fresh angle and humour into a familiar tale. During California's shelter in place order in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Freeman Ng created The House We Sheltered In, a picture book that could be freely downloaded and printed out on home printers. The popularity of the rhyme can be seen in its use in a variety of other cultural contexts, including: =In literature and journalism= *Samuel Taylor Coleridge used it as the basis of a self-parody published in 1797 under the name Nehemiah Higginbotham.

The team fielded multiple trucks, usually with sponsorship from Red Line Oil and the Coverall Carports.  Truck No. 23 history  Team Racing made its debut in 1999 at Evergreen Speedway, under the banner Team 23 Racing. Bonifield qualified the No. 23 truck 29th but finished 30th after suffering fuel pump failure early in the race. Jerry Kobza ran the truck two races later at Memphis Motorsports Park, but dropped out early due to engine failure. Bonifield ran the truck for most of the year, posting thirteen more starts and a best finish of 30th twice, finishing 31st in points. Kobza was supposed to share the ride with Bonifield during the season, but did not qualify for his attempts and soon left the team. David Starr ran two races in the 23 at Portland and Watkins Glen, finishing 31st and 29th, respectively. Boris Said also drove in a one-race deal at Richmond International Raceway, finishing seventeenth, and Tom Bambard ran the 23 at California Speedway, finishing 22nd. Rick McCray attempted Texas Motor Speedway, but failed to qualify. The team returned in 2000, with Bonifield as the primary driver. He ran eight races and had a best finish of 30th at Nazareth Speedway. Carl Long ran at Texas and finished seventeenth, and Bill Lester ran at Portland, finishing 24th. In 2001, Bonifield started the year running the 23, but moved over to pilot trucks owned by Impact Motorsports. Dana White took over at Memphis Motorsports Park, finishing 20th. Lance Hooper and Michael Dokken both ran one race apiece in the 23, before Bonifield finished out the year for the team. Bonifield‚Äôs best finish in seven starts the No. 23 in 2002 was 31st at Milwaukee. Emerson Newton-John ran the truck for one race at Loudon, finishing 31st. Hooper ran the truck for a pair of races, before White, Bonifield, and Wayne Edwards took over for the rest of the year. In 2003, White and Bonifield started out the year, before Jamie Aube took over briefly. Bonifield ran thirteen races in the 23 that season, his best finish 24th at Kentucky Speedway, White‚Äôs best finish was 32nd at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and Aube‚Äôs best run a 33rd at Texas. Alex M√ºller also ran a race at Indianapolis Raceway Park, finishing 26th. At the end of the season, the 23 team stopped running in the Truck series, as its equipment was sold to Bill Davis Racing.  Truck No. 25 history  The 25 truck made its debut in 2002 after Bonifield purchased Impact's equipment when the team closed its doors. The organization, newly named Team Racing, debuted the 25 truck at the MBNA America 200 . Ronnie Hornaday started and finished 28th after suffering engine failure. Dokken, Brian Tyler, White, Brian Rose, and Barry Bodine all ran one race apiece in the 25 before Bonifield finished out the year for the team. The 25 truck made its debut the next season when Aube finished 36th at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Wayne Edwards took over for a pair of races, his best finish 36th at Texas. Aube also ran two races in the 25, his best finish 35th at Las Vegas. In 2004, Bonifield ran four races in the 25, before the team closed its doors.  Truck No. 86 history  Like the 25, Bonifield and Mazzuchi purchased the 86's equipment from the defunct Impact Motorsports in 2002. Under the Team Racing banner, the 86 made its debut in the beginning of 2002 at the Florida Dodge Dealers 250 with Bonifield driving. He finished 35th. Wayne Edwards made two starts in the 86 in 2002, his best finish 25th at the Darlington 200. Then White drove the 86 for six races, his best finish a 24th twice. Donnie Neuenberger also attempted a race, but failed to qualify. Lance Hooper finished the year in the 86, his best finish a sixteenth at South Boston Speedway. After Hooper left during Daytona 2003, Bonifield drove the 86 in eight races, his best finish a 23rd in Memphis. Rookie T. J. Bell took over for nine races. His best finish was 12th at Dover, the best finish a Team Racing driver ever posted. Brad Teague finished sixteenth at Bristol in a one-race deal, and Shane Wallace had a 26th-place finish at Texas, before Aube and Bonifield finished out the year in the truck. The team dissolved at the end of the season, despite finishing in 20th in owner's points. In 2007, the team purchased equipment from R3 Racing, and returned at the Quaker State & Lube 200 with Clay Rogers finishing 35th after a clutch failure. Dana White and Kevin Lepage drove in several races for Team Racing as well that season.

History Maxstoke and the parish of Maxstoke were established in the hundred of Hemlingford. =Maxstoke Priory= The Priory was established by Sir William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon in 1331 when he endowed a College of Priests consisting of five chaplains and a warden. It was built adjacent to an earlier moated farmstead, south of his castle towards Packington village. In 1336 it was expanded to a full Priory for Augustinian Canons and was completed in 1343. It was dissolved in 1536, when the buildings and lands were granted to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Today only ruins remain with the exception of the Inner Gatehouse. This was a farmhouse in the Elizabethan period and is now a bed and breakfast establishment. Inside is a room with painted armorial shields. The entrance to the farm is by the Outer Gatehouse. The two niches are now empty of statues. On the ends of the drip mouldings over the central window are two busts, one of a knight with his visor down and another of a monk. In the fields around the priory can be seen traces of medieval earthworks for fish farming and water control. =Maxstoke Church= The Parish Church of St Michael is of the same age as that of the Priory. The remains of a 14th-century preaching cross can be seen in the churchyard. =Maxstoke Castle= To the north of Maxstoke, about half way towards Shustoke, is Maxstoke Castle. It was built by Sir William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, in 1345. It is of a square plan with a broad moat. Additions were made by Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham who acquired it in 1437 by exchanging it for other manors in Northamptonshire. Railway A station was opened on Maxstoke Lane. The station was on the Stonebridge Railway. It connected Birmingham with Derby and Hampton-in-Arden. The station had closed in 1930s along with the connection line. The site of platform and sign can still be seen. It also was located near the town of Coleshill. Maxstoke Hill Challenge The Maxstoke Hill Challenge is a cycling time trial measured from the bottom of Maxstoke Hill (where the road does a 90-degree turn) to the very top of the hill (past the water works ‚Äì first lay by on the left). The long-standing record held by Mr N Wiggin was beaten by Mr J House on his return to the UK in April 2012. The record now stands at 4 minutes 37 seconds. Handley Page o/400 crash On 19 August 1918 a Royal Air Force (RAF) Handley Page O/400 from No. 14 Aircraft Acceptance Park RAF took off from Castle Bromwich Aerodrome on a test flight. While flying over North Warwickshire, the pilots lost control of the aircraft and crashed into a field at Maxstoke, North Warwickshire, killing all seven crew on board. The pilots were Canadian Lt Robert Edward Andrew MacBeth and Lt Frederick James Bravery. The other crew members were air mechanics Charles William Offord, J May, Albert J Winrow, H Simmons and G Greenland. MacBeth and Simmons were buried in St. Michaels's Church graveyard. The cause of the accident was determined to be loss of control due to wing failure when the aircraft lost fabric from a wing. It was the deadliest accident involving the Royal Air Force at the time.

It is usually denoted by the Greek letter Œæ. The extent of a reaction has units of amount (moles). It was introduced by the Belgian scientist Th√©ophile de Donder. Definition Consider the reaction :A ‚áå B Suppose an infinitesimal amount dŒæ of the reactant A changes into B. The change of the amount of A can be represented by the equation dnA = ‚Äì dŒæ and the change of B is dnB = dŒæ. The extent of reaction is then defined as : d\\\\xi= \\\\frac{dn_i}{ u_i} where n_i denotes the amount of the i-th reactant and u_iis the stoichiometric coefficient (or stoichiometric number using IUPAC nomenclature) of the i-th reactant. In other words, it is the amount of substance that is being changed in an equilibrium reaction. Considering finite changes instead of infinitesimal changes, one can write the equation for the extent of a reaction as :\\\\Delta \\\\xi=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta n_i}{ u_i} The extent of a reaction is defined as zero at the beginning of the reaction. Thus the change of Œæ is the extent itself. :\\\\xi=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta n_i}{ u_i}=\\\\frac{n_{equilibrium}-n_{initial}}{ u_i} Relations The relation between the change in Gibbs reaction energy and Gibbs energy can be defined as the slope of the Gibbs energy plotted against the extent of reaction at constant pressure and temperature. :\\\\Delta _r G=\\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial \\\\xi}\\\\right )_{p,T} Analogously, the relation between the change in reaction enthalpy and enthalpy can be defined. :\\\\Delta _r H=\\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial \\\\xi}\\\\right )_{p,T} Example The extent of reaction is a useful quantity in computations with equilibrium reactions. Consider the reaction :2A ‚áå B + 3 C where the initial amounts are n_A = 2\\\\ \\\\text{mol} , n_B=1\\\\ \\\\text{mol} , n_C=0\\\\ \\\\text{mol}, and the equilibrium amount of A is 0.5 mol. We can calculate the extent of reaction from its definition :\\\\xi=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta n_A}{ u_A}=\\\\frac{0.5\\\\ \\\\text{mol}-2\\\\ \\\\text{mol}}{-2}=0.75\\\\ \\\\text{mol} Do not forget that the stoichiometric number of reactants is negative. Now when we know the extent, we can rearrange the equation and calculate the equilibrium amounts of B and C. :n_{equilibrium}=\\\\xi u_i+n_{initial} :n_{B}=0.75\\\\ \\\\text{mol}\\\\times 1+1\\\\ \\\\text{mol}=1.75\\\\ \\\\text{mol} :n_{C}=0.75\\\\ \\\\text{mol}\\\\times 3+0\\\\ \\\\text{mol}=2.25\\\\ \\\\text{mol} References Category:Physical chemistry Category:Analytical chemistry ","title":"Extent of reaction"},{"id":"3670763","text":"Uncaria tomentosa is a woody vine found in the tropical jungles of South and Central America. It is known as cat's claw or u√±a de gato in Spanish because of its claw-shaped thorns. The plant root bark is used in herbalism for a variety of ailments, and is sold as a dietary supplement. Description Uncaria tomentosa is a liana deriving its name from hook-like thorns that resemble the claws of a cat. U. tomentosa can grow to a length of up to 30 m (100 ft), climbing by means of these thorns. The leaves are elliptic with a smooth edge, and grow in opposing pairs. Cat's claw is indigenous to the Amazon rainforest, with its habitat being restricted primarily to the tropical areas of South and Central America. Taxonomy There are two species of cat's claw commonly used in North America and Europe, Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis, having different properties and uses. The two are frequently confused but U. tomentosa is the more commonly used in traditional medicine. U. tomentosa is further divided into two chemotypes that remain under preliminary research for their properties and compounds. There are other plants which are known as cat's claw (or u√±a de gato) in Mexico and Latin America; however, they are entirely different plant species, belonging to neither the genus Uncaria, nor to the family Rubiaceae. Phytochemicals Phytochemicals in Uncaria tomentosa root bark include oxindole and indole alkaloids, glycosides, organic acids, proanthocyanidins, sterols, and triterpenes. Traditional medicine Cat's claw has been used as a traditional medicine in South American countries over centuries for its supposed health benefits, and is a common herbal supplement. The part used medicinally is the bark of the vine or root. As of 2020, there is no high- quality clinical evidence that it has any benefit in treating diseases. Adverse reactions Individuals allergic to plants in the family Rubiaceae and different species of Uncaria may be more likely to have adverse reactions to cat's claw. Reactions can include itching, rash and allergic inflammation of the kidneys. People requiring anticoagulant therapy should not use cat's claw.

Paul Torrance, the development of creative capabilities in children and gifted populations. Life John Curtis Gowan was born May 21, 1912 in Boston, Massachusetts. Graduating from Thayer Academy, Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1929, John Gowan was only 17 when he entered Harvard University, earning his undergraduate degree four years later. A master's degree in mathematics followed; he then moved to Culver, Indiana, where he was employed as a counselor and mathematics teacher at Culver Military Academy from 1941 to 1952. Earning a doctorate from UCLA, he became a member of the founding faculty at the California State University at Northridge, where he taught as a professor of Educational Psychology from 1953 until 1975, when he retired with emeritus status. Dr. Gowan became interested in gifted children after the Russians gained superiority in space with the 1957 launch of Sputnik. He formed the National Association for Gifted Children the following year. He was the group's executive director and president from 1975 to 1979 and over the years wrote more than 100 articles and fourteen books on gifted children, teacher evaluation, child development, and creativity. While at Northridge, he developed a program to train campus counselors, was nominated in 1973 as outstanding professor, and had been a counselor, researcher, Fulbright lecturer, and visiting professor at various schools including the University of Singapore, the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, the University of Hawaii, and Connecticut State College. He was a fellow of the American Psychological Association and was also a colleague of the Creative Education Foundation. Besides his work in Educational Psychology as specifically related to gifted children, he also had an interest in psychic (or psychedelic) phenomena as it relates to human creativity. His work in this area was inspired by the writings of Aldous Huxley and Carl Jung. Based on his work in creativity and with gifted children, Dr. Gowan developed a model of mental development that derived from the work of Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson, but also included adult development beyond the ordinary adult successes of career and family building, extending into the emergence and stabilization of extraordinary development and mystical states of consciousness. He described the entire spectrum of available states in his classic Trance, Art, & Creativity (1975), with its different modalities of spiritual and aesthetic expression. He also devised a test for self-actualization, (as defined by Abraham Maslow), called the Northridge Developmental Scale. Dr. Gowan died on December 2, 1986.

As a reward for the administration of the Vatican finances, in 1794 Pope Pius VI created Giovanni Torlonia Duke of Bracciano and Count of Pisciarelli; in 1803 Pope Pius VII further created him Marquis of Romavecchia and Turrita and 1st Prince (Princeps Romanus) of Civitella Cesi; in 1809 he was elevated to Patrician (with confirmation of that honor by Pius VII on January 19, 1813) and in 1820 became Duke of Poli and Guadagnolo, with other titles. He was the builder of the Villa Torlonia in Rome (started 1806), as well as other Torlonia villas.

Biography  At the age of 18, Liz Fordred, a passionate horseback rider, was thrown from her horse, striking her head. She suffered injuries which left her with only the use of her arms, shoulders, and upper torso. While recovering from the accident, she met, and later married, Pete Fordred, another paraplegic. In 1980, in their second year of marriage, the Fordreds decided to build an ocean-capable sailboat, and sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Construction of the boat, which was specially tailored to their needs, took four years; they were hampered by lack of funds, bureaucratic red tape, the economic embargo of Rhodesia, and ‚Äî most of all ‚Äî criticism from the public. The boat, Usikusiku, was made of ferroconcrete (a fairly common technique in home boat building). Having completed construction, the couple then had to transport Usikusiku from land-locked Rhodesia to the sea. They chose travel 1,200 miles to Durban by truck. Once in Durban, they set sail for their Atlantic crossing, stopping in several ports along the way. The voyage was arduous; they encountered a major storm off the Bahamas, and had to contend with persistent seasickness. On some occasions, the sea was so rough that they were unable to make the trip below to cook or eat. However, sixteen months after their departure, they arrived safely in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they settled down; shortly afterwards, they had a daughter. In Florida, the boat was not maintained and by 2000 was no longer seaworthy.

The story is divided into two sections. The first centers around Jakob Beer, a Polish Holocaust survivor while the second involves a man named Ben, the son of two Holocaust survivors. It was first published in Canada in 1996 and was published in the United Kingdom the following year.Library of Toronto ProfileBBC Michaels profile Since the publication, the novel has won awards such as Books in Canada First Novel Award, the Trillium Book Award, Orange Prize for Fiction, Guardian Fiction Prize and the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize. For over two years the novel was on Canada's bestseller list, and it was translated into over 20 different languages. Plot The novel is split into two sections: Book I and Book II. = Book I = Jakob Beer is a 7-year- old child of a Jewish family living in Poland. His house is stormed by Nazis; he escapes the fate of his parents and his sister, Bella, by hiding behind the wallpaper in a cabinet. He hides in the forest, burying himself up to the neck in the soil. After some time, he runs into an archaeologist, Athos Roussos, working on Biskupin. Athos secretly takes him to Zakynthos in Greece. Athos is also a geologist, and is fascinated with ancient wood and stones. Jakob learns Greek and English, but finds that learning new languages erases his memory of the past. After the war, Athos and Jakob move to Toronto, where after several years Jakob meets Alexandra in a music library. Alex is a fast-paced, outspokenly philosophical master of wordplay. Jakob and Alex fall in love and marry, but the relationship fails because Alex expects Jakob to change too fast and abandon his past. Jakob dwells constantly on his memories of Bella, especially her piano-playing, and they end up divorcing. Jakob meets and marries Michaela, a much younger woman but one who seems to understand him, and with Michaela's help he is able to let go of Bella. Together they move to Greece into the former home of several generations of the Roussos family. = Book II = The second part of the book is told from the perspective of Ben, a Canadian professor of Jewish descent who was born in Canada to survivors of the Holocaust. In 1954 the family home in Weston, Ontario is destroyed by Hurricane Hazel. Ben becomes an expert on the history of weather, and marries a girl named Naomi. He is a big admirer of Jakob's poetry and respects the way he deals with the Holocaust, when Ben himself has trouble coping with the horrors his parents must have endured. At the end of the novel, Ben is sent to retrieve Jakob's journals from his home in Greece, where Ben spends hours swimming in Jakob's past.  Main characters  # Jakob Beer‚ÄîThe only survivor of his town who is found and rescued by Athos. He is an intelligent boy who later becomes a renowned poet. # Athos Roussos‚ÄîA geologist who rescues Jakob and becomes his guardian. He teaches Jakob about the beauty of science and also the world. # Ben‚ÄîAn admirer of Jakob and his poetry. He travels to Greece to find Jakob's journals.  Theme, style and structure  Fugitive Pieces contains themes of trauma, grief, loss, and memory, primarily in relation to the Holocaust, which Michaels explores via metaphors such as nature. The work is told in a poetic style, which has caused some critics to view it as an elegy, and others, such as Donna Coffey, to feel that it re-imagines the literary telling of the Holocaust and also of nature. The story is told through two narratives, in the first part, Jakob's, then in the second part, Ben's, which are connected through one main event that had an effect on both narrators. John Mullan has stated that he feels that the book shows how the Holocaust and traumatic moments can impact generations of survivors and their family members. Fugitive Pieces also contains mentions of the senses, which are shown through an emphasis of Jakob hearing what happened to his family, rather than seeing the event take place, which in turns adds to his trauma and his inability to gain closure. Similarly, Ben has only heard stories but never had first hand experience. Michaels uses this to convey a paradox between what we hear, the language, and then the silence that follows due to the suffering and trauma of others.Williams, Merle;Polatinsky, Stefan. \\"Writing at Its Limits: Trauma Theory in Relation to Anne Michael's Fugitive Pieces.\\" ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA, vol. 52, no. 1, 2009, p. 1. The title of the novel is taken from Fugitive Pieces, Lord Byron's first volume of verse, privately printed in the autumn of 1806. Reception Along with winning many awards, Michaels has received praise from multiple media outlets and academics such as University College London professor John Mullan and Michiko Kakutani. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Fugitive Pieces on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Film adaptation The novel was made into a feature film produced by Robert Lantos through his Toronto-based Serendipity Point Films Inc. It opened at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. It was directed by Jeremy Podeswa, based on his screenplay adaptation of the Michaels novel. It stars Stephen Dillane as Jakob Beer and Rade ≈†erbed≈æija as Athos.

Examples include routers, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, and a variety of metropolitan area network (MAN) and wide area network (WAN) access devices. Edge devices also provide connections into carrier and service provider networks. An edge device that connects a local area network to a high speed switch or backbone (such as an ATM switch) may be called an edge concentrator. Functions In general, edge devices are normally routers that provide authenticated access (most commonly PPPoA and PPPoE) to faster, more efficient backbone and core networks. The trend is to make the edge device smart and the core device(s) \\"dumb and fast\\", so edge routers often include Quality of Service (QoS) and multi-service functions to manage different types of traffic. Consequently, core networks are often designed with switches that use routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for reliability and scalability, allowing edge routers to have redundant links to the core network. Links between core networks are different, for example Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routers often used for peering exchanges. Translation Edge devices may translate between one type of network protocol and another. For example, Ethernet or token ring types of local area networks (LANs) or xDSL equipment may use an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) backbone to other core networks. ATM networks send data in cells and use connection-oriented virtual circuits. An IP network is packet oriented; so if ATM is used as a core, packets must be encapsulated in cells and the destination address must be converted to a virtual circuit identifier. Some new types of optical fibre use a Passive optical network subscriber loop such as GPON, with the edge device connecting to Ethernet for backhaul (telecommunications). Multiservice units An edge switch for a WAN may be a multiservice unit, meaning that it supports a wide variety of communication technologies, including Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), T1 circuits, frame relay, and ATM. An edge device may provide enhanced services, such as virtual private networking (VPN) support, Voice over IP, and QoS services.

The pound was made of 4.33 grams of silver (with 9/10 of purity), correspondently to the German standards. Six pounds were called shield (scudo) and were equivalent to the Austrian Conventionsthaler. Each pound was divided into 100 cents (centesimi). All currencies were a re-establishment of the pounds used in the Duchy of Milan until 1796, whereas they had no relation with former defunct Venetian pound. Coins were minted in Milan, Venice and Vienna. Due to the heavy consequences of the war, Austria was not able to immediately produce the new currency when it took possession of the territory in 1814. So, Napoleonic Italian lira continued to be a legal tender for eight years after the fall of its inventor. The first issue of the Austrian currency was possible only in 1822. New pounds had a lower value than their French- Italian predecessors, which weighed 5 grams. During the revolutions of 1848, the Lombard Provisional Government briefly suspended the production of the pound and minted instead a special Italian lira ‚Ç§5 coin. After the revolutions and the restoration of the Austrian monetary standard, copper coins were reduced in weight. For political purposes the name on these coins (the most popular in circulation) was changed from Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia to the Austrian Empire. When metropolitan Austria decimalized in 1857, the change did not immediately affected the Kingdom, where old pounds were minted again in 1858. Only in 1862, after the loss of Lombardy to the newborn Italian State, did the remaining part of the Austrian territories adopt the general coinage of the Empire.

Early career Marrable was the son of Sir Thomas Smith Marrable, who was Secretary of the Board of Green Cloth (responsible for organising Royal visits) for King George IV and King William IV. He began his architectural career articled to Edward Blore in 1835, and subsequently studied abroad, which influenced his architectural style. He started his own company when he returned to Britain. In this period he designed St Mary Magdalene's Church in St Leonards-on-Sea (1852). Metropolitan Board Offices for the Metropolitan Board of Works, 1860 by Frederick Marrable. A line drawing from the Illustrated London News, demonstrating the interest in the new building He was selected without any great controversy as the first Chief Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works on 1 February 1856. Marrable was not a particularly well-regarded architect but no greater figure applied for the job, partially because the salary being offered was relatively low, but also because the architect would largely be responsible for building roads and not distinctive buildings. Marrable approached this task with a methodical eye, but often ended up being perceived as boring, as The Elector for 27 June 1857 said that he was \\"squeezing every word to death almost in a half-closed mouth, so that nobody scarcely knows what he says\\". Under his supervision, Garrick Street and Southwark Street were designed. When the Metropolitan Board obtained a site at Spring Gardens to build its headquarters, Marrable was naturally engaged to design it. He produced a three-storey building in the Italianate style, which (after subsequent enlargements) was impressive for Nikolaus Pevsner to regard as the chief interest in the street. Resignation By the end of 1860, Marrable was beginning to feel that he was being grossly underpaid and overworked. He referred to having written more than five thousand reports for the Board, and demanded an increase in his ¬£800 annual salary. The Board, conscious of the opposition of the Vestries to any increase in its demands for money, reluctantly offered a raise to ¬£1,200 (to then go up in stages to ¬£1,500). There was indeed an outcry, with John Nicholay (member for Marylebone, a vestry committed to strict economy) describing the proposal as an act of suicide. The proposed new salary was then scaled back to ¬£1,000. Marrable thought this a contemptible offer and resigned in February 1861. Subsequent career The Garrick Club, in its smoke-blackened state before the cleaning. After his resignation, Marrable designed his most notable surviving building, the Garrick Club (1864) which was again in an Italianate palazzo style. The Garrick is fronted in Portland render which blackened over the years; proposals to clean it did not receive the support of club members until 2005. Marrable married Madeline Cockburn, a painter, in the same year. He continued to work occasionally on Metropolitan Board of Works compensation matters; an inquiry many years after his death found evidence that he may have been corrupt. Another building designed by Marrable was St Peter's Church in Brockley (1866‚Äì70). Death The Marrable's family grave at Kensal Green Cemetery, London Marrable died suddenly on a visit to inspect the Bethlehem Hospital for Convalescents in Witley, and is buried at the Kensal Green Cemetery in London. His posthumous reputation tends to concentrate on his work for the Metropolitan Board, rather than his contribution to architecture.

It has both European (Vitis vinifera) and American vine species in its pedigree and a broad resistance against the most significant fungal diseases which affect grapes, such as downy mildew. History Regent was created in 1967 by Professor Gerhardt Alleweldt at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding by crossing Diana, a Silvaner x M√ºller-Thurgau cross and thus a Vitis vinifera variety, with the interspecific hybrid Chambourcin.Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Regent , accessed on June 19, 2008 Experimental plantings followed in 1985,German Wine Institute: Regent , accessed on June 19, 2008 and it received varietal protection in 1994 and was released for cultivation in the first German region in 1996.Institute of Grapevine Breeding Geilweilerhof: Regent , accessed on June 19, 2008 It is at present among the most important new fungal-resistant quality grape variety world-wide, especially in German wine regions. Wine regions A Regent wine produced in the Puget Sound AVA of Washington State. The cultivated area in Germany was in 2006, with an increasing trend.German Wine Institute: German Wine Statistics 2007‚Äì2008 This made it Germany's 12th most cultivated variety, and the most cultivated hybrid grape variety. Regent is also grown in the United Kingdom with some success. In Belgium, it is authorised for all still wine AOCs : C√¥tes de Sambre et Meuse,Decree text of C√¥tes de Sambre et Meuse (in French) Hageland, Decree text of Hageland (in Dutch) Haspengouw, Decree text of Haspengouw (in Dutch) and Heuvelland. Decree text of Heuvelland (in Dutch) Grape and grapegrowing Regent is a cool-weather red winegrape. Regent provides medium-sized grapes and clusters. It is a heavy bearer, and has an upright growing habit that is similar to vinifera: It can be trained to the VSP (Vertical Shoot Positioning) method from canes tied to the low fruiting wire. It is a mid to late-season ripener. In some climates (e.g., NW Oregon USA), Regent often blooms during the last week of the Spring rains (which usually cease on or about July 5), and the blooms, if wet, are highly susceptible to Botrytis, which rots the flower clusters and prevents fruit set. This is the primary \\"Achilles Heel\\" of this otherwise impressive grape; a lesser disadvantage is its late ripening schedule. This grape would do best in a cool, dry area with a long growing season. Further north in upstate Washington, the vine buds and flowers later and this issue is less observed. Without preventive steps, Regent often yields no fruit in NW Oregon. Two of the more-common and successful preventive steps are: (a) spraying the flowers with fermented horsetail tea; or (b) painting the pruned canes white, which fools the plant into budding out later, thereby often avoiding the Botrytis problem because flowering occurs in the dry season. Wines Regent wines are colour intensive red wines with moderate acidity, can have rather much tannin and show aromas of cherries or blackcurrants. The wines often reach high alcohol levels since Regent tends to reach high must weights. Some better German versions are matured in barriques. The grape is fairly easy to make good wine from. It has excellent skin color (perhaps so much that the color can seem overly vivid), and clean vinifera-type flavors.

It lies along West Virginia Secondary Route 1 at its junction with Leetown Pike. An early historical distinction of the town is the interesting confluence of the estates of three British born, British colonial military officers who served under General Braddock and were all involved in the disastrous British operations against French and Indian forces at Fort Duquesne (modern Pittsburgh) and who later became American revolutionary officers under George Washington. The town is named for the eccentric General Charles Lee, a British officer. He was born in Cheshire in 1732 and purchased an estate in Virginia in 1776. He called the estate \\"Prato Rio\\" and the main house rests today just south of town. Major General Adam Stephen established a hunting lodge ‚ÄúThe Bower‚Äù in 1750 one mile west of Leetown along Opequon Creek. Their mutual Revolutionary War colleague General Horatio Gates, the victor of the Battle of Saratoga, lived four miles north of town in the estate \\"Traveler‚Äôs Rest\\". St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Episcopal Church is an attractive feature of Leetown. It was consecrated in 1846 as part of the recovery of the Episcopal Church in (then) Virginia after its low ebb in the years after the Revolution. The church was badly damaged during the Civil War. The town is featured in the documentation of the general ebb and flow of forces during the Civil War. On July 3, 1864 a running battle took place through the town in which troops under Lieutenant General Jubal Early, after initial setback, prevailed over Federal forces. The victory cleared the way for Early‚Äôs entry into Maryland as part of the third and last Confederate invasion of the North, culminating in a Pyrrhic victory at Monocacy Junction near Frederick, Maryland on July 8. After the conflict, the artist David English Henderson resided in Leetown, rendering on canvas his memories as a soldier in the Army of Northern Virginia.

It was subdivided into 100 quattrini (singular: quattrino), a local currency made by four pennies (from the Latin: quater denarii). There was an additional denomination called the paolo, worth 40 quattrini, in circulation. History During the Napoleonic Wars, Tuscany was annexed by France and the French franc was introduced, together with its satellite Italian lira. Previous Tuscan pound did not disappear, but a big confusion was created between the old pound (called lira in Italian) and the new lira. So, when Duke Leopold II rose to power in 1824, he decided to introduce a new basic currency. The florin replaced the Tuscan pound at a rate of pounds = 1 florin.This fact was quite obvious, because the pound was equivalent to 240 pennies or 60 quattrini, while the florin was equivalent to 100 quattrini or 400 pennies. In 1847, Tuscany absorbed Lucca and the florin replaced the Luccan pound at a rate of 1 florin = 2 pounds. After a brief revolutionary coinage, the florin was replaced in 1859 by a provisional currency denominated in \\"Italian lira\\", equal to the Sardinian lira, with 1 florin = 1.4 Italian lire. =Coins= Copper coins were struck in denominations of 1 and 3 quattrini, together with billon 5 and 10 quattrini, silver , 1 and 5 paolo, , , 1 and 4 florins.

System Eta Orionis is listed in multiple star catalogues as having two companions: a bright component B less than 2\\" away; and a faint component C nearly 2' away. The two are estimated to orbit every 1.8 thousand years. The primary star, Eta Orionis A, is itself a spectroscopic triple star, known from multiple spectral lines with varying radial velocities. The most distant component Ac, has been resolved using speckle interferometry, at a separation of about 0.04\\" It orbits the other two in 9.4 years. The two closest stars, Aa and Ab, are separated by only about a tenth of an astronomical unit and orbit in just under eight days. The system lies within the Orion OB1 association, a group of massive stars that includes most of the bright stars of Orion. It is assigned to the oldest and closest part of the association, known as OB1a. Variability Eta Orionis drops in brightness every four days from a combined apparent magnitude of 3.31 to about magnitude 3.6. This is due to eclipses between the two closest components, Aa and Ab. The primary and secondary eclipses are very similar, 0.24 and 0.23 magnitudes deep respectively. It has also been suggested that component Ab is intrinsically variable with a period of 0.3 days and a very small amplitude. This star has unusual variable spectral lines and lies with the Œ≤ Cephei variable instability strip. However, it is now thought that the variable component is either B and Ac, possibly due to an unseen companion or rotational modulation.

It was subdivided into 100 baiocchi (singular: baiocco), each of 5 quattrini (singular: quattrino). Other denominations included the grosso of 5 baiocchi, the carlino of 7¬Ω baiocchi, the giulio and paoli both of 10 baiocchi, the testone of 30 baiocchi and the doppia of 3 scudi. History In addition to issues for the Papal States as a whole, the currency was also issued by many of the individual municipalities. In the late 18th century, this included issues from Ancona, Ascoli, Bologna, Civitavecchia, Fano, Fermo, Foligno, Gubbio, Macerata, Matelica, Montalto, Pergola, Perugia, Ronciglione, San Severino, Spoleto, Terni, Tivoli and Viterbo. Uniquely in Bologna the baiocco, also known as the bolognino, was subdivided into 6 quattrini. Between 1798 and 1799, the revolutionary French forces established the Roman Republic, which issued coins denominated in baiocco and scudo. In addition, the municipalities of Ancona, Civitavecchia, Clitunno, Foligno, Gubbio, Pergola and Perugia issued coins in the name of the Roman Republic. In 1808, the Papal States were annexed by France, and the French franc circulated officially. When the Pope's authority was restored in 1814, the scudo was restored as the currency. However, outside Rome solely the coinage of Bologna was resumed. In 1849, another Roman Republic was established which issued coins centrally and in Ancona. In 1866, the scudo was replaced by the lira, equivalent to the Italian lira, allowing the participation to the Latin Monetary Union. The exchange rate used was 5.375 lire = 1 scudo. Coins In the late eighteenth century, coins were issued in copper in denominations of 1 quattrino, ¬Ω, 1, 2, 2¬Ω and 5 baiocchi, along with billon coins for 1, 4, 8, 12, 25 and 50 baiocchi, 1 and 2 carlini, silver coins for 1 grosso, 1 and 2 giulio, 1 testone and 1 scudo, and gold coins for ¬Ω and 1 zecchino and 1 and 2 doppia. The individual states issued similar coinages, with the exception of Bologna, which additionally issued silver 12 baiocchi, ¬Ω scudo and 80 bolognini, and gold 2, 5 and 10 zecchini. The 1798 to 1799 Roman Republic issued copper ¬Ω, 1, 2 and 5 baiocchi and silver 1 scudo. After the restoration of the currency, billon coins were no longer issued and several other denominations disappeared. There were copper 1 quattrino, ¬Ω and 1 baiocco, silver 1 grosso, 1 and 2 giulio and 1 scudo, and gold 1 doppia. The silver testone was reintroduced in 1830, followed by 50 baiocchi in 1832. In 1835, a new coinage was introduced which abandoned all the denomination names except for the quattrino, baiocco and scudo. Copper coins were issued in denominations of 1 quattrino, ¬Ω and 1 baiocco, with silver 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 baiocchi and 1 scudo, and gold 2¬Ω, 5 and 10 scudi. In 1849, the Roman Republic issued a coinage consisting of copper ¬Ω, 1 and 3 baiocchi and silver 4, 8, 16 and 40 baiocchi. Following the restoration of the Papal States, copper 2 and 5 baiocchi were introduced. Banknotes From 1785, paper money was issued by the Santo Monte Della Piet√† di Roma in denominations from 3 scudi up to 1500 scudi, while, from 1786, the Banco di Santo Spirito di Roma issued notes from 3 scudi up to 3000 scudi. The 1798 to 1799 Roman Republic issued notes in various denominations including 3 and 40 baiocchi, 8, 9 and 10 paoli. The treasury of the Papal States issued notes during the 19th century.

After the difficult release of his controversial short film Zero for Conduct (1933), Vigo initially wanted to make a film about Eug√®ne Dieudonn√©, whom Vigo's father (anarchist Miguel Almereyda) had been associated with in 1913. After Vigo and his producer Jacques-Louis Nounez struggled to find the right project for a feature film, Nounez finally gave Vigo an unproduced screenplay by Jean Guin√©e about barge dwellers. Vigo re- wrote the story with Albert Ri√©ra, while Nounez secured a distribution deal with the Gaumont Film Company with a budget of ‚Ç£1 million. Vigo used many of the technicians and actors who worked with him on Zero for Conduct, such as cinematographer Boris Kaufman and actor Jean Dast√©. It has been hailed by many critics as one of the greatest films of all time.\\"Vigo Passion for Life.\\" BFI. Retrieved: 23 December 2012. Plot Jean, the captain of the canal barge L'Atalante, marries Juliette in her village. They decide to live aboard L'Atalante along with Jean's crew, the scruffy and eccentric P√®re Jules and the cabin boy. The couple travel to Paris to deliver cargo, enjoying a makeshift honeymoon en route. Jules and the cabin boy are not used to the presence of a woman aboard. When Jean discovers Juliette and Jules talking in Jules' quarters, Jean flies into a jealous rage by smashing plates and by sending Jules' numerous cats scattering. Arriving in Paris, Jean promises Juliette a night out, but Jules and the cabin boy disembark to go see a fortune teller. This disappoints Juliette because Jean cannot leave the barge unattended. Later, however, Jean takes Juliette to a dance hall. There, they meet a street peddler who flirts with Juliette, dances with her, and asks her to run off with him. This leads to a scuffle with Jean, after which he drags Juliette back to the barge. Juliette still wants to see the nightlife in Paris however, so she sneaks off the barge to go see the sights. When Jean discovers that she sneaked off the barge, he furiously casts off and leaves Juliette behind in Paris. Unaware that Jean has already left, Juliette goes window shopping. When she returns to the barge and finds that it's gone, she tries to buy a train ticket to the barge's next destination, but someone steals her purse before she is able to. She is forced to find a job so she can afford to live and eventually travel to Le Havre to meet the barge: her activities during this period are unclear. Meanwhile, Jean comes to regret his decision, and slips into depression. He is summoned by his company's manager, but Jules manages to keep him from losing his job. Jean recalls a folk tale that Juliette once told him. She said that one can see the face of one's true love in the water. He attempts to recreate this by dunking his head in a bucket, and, failing that, jumping into the river. Jules decides to leave and try to find Juliette. He finds her in a store and they return to the barge where the couple reunite and happily embrace each other.

Vigo suggested they work on a prison film about French anarchist Eug√®ne Dieudonn√©, whom Vigo's father Miguel Almereyda had defended in a newspaper article in 1913. Vigo began working on the film with Dieudonn√©, who had agreed to play himself, and Julot Dupont, an expert on French prisons. After Zero for Conduct was banned in France for its controversial depiction of the French education system, Nounez was worried that such a film could not be distributed. Other ideas for films considered by Nounez and Vigo include an adaptation of Georges de La Fouchardi√®re's L'Affaire Peau-de-Balle, and a script Vigo had written about the relationship between a bourgeois father and his more progressive son. In July 1933, Nounez finally gave Vigo a scenario about \\"barge dwellers\\" called L'Atalante, written by Jean Guin√©e. In the early 1930s, films and music about \\"barge dwellers\\" were popular in France and had inspired such pop songs as \\"Chanson de halage\\" and \\"Le chaland qui pass√©\\".The Complete Jean Vigo DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 35. Vigo initially disliked the scenario, but finally agreed to make the film and began making suggestions for the story. Nounez produced the film for ‚Ç£1 million and made a deal with the Gaumont Film Company to provide studio sets and distribute the film. Vigo hired people he frequently collaborated with, such as cinematographer Boris Kaufman, composer Maurice Jaubert, and art director Francis Jourdain, who was an old friend of his father. Boris Kaufman, the brother of Soviet film maker Dziga Vertov, described his years working with Vigo as \\"cinematic paradise.\\" Vigo also hired established film editor Louis Chavance after he found it difficult to edit Zero for Conduct himself. Chavance had attended the premiere of Zero for Conduct and had been one of its early supporters and quickly became friends with Vigo. Vigo and Albert Ri√©ra quickly wrote a shooting script and scouted locations at docks during the summer of 1933. They also found and leased Louise XVI, the barge used for the film. =Casting= Vigo worked with established movie stars for the first time, who were hired by Gaumont but approved of by Vigo. Michel Simon had been a lead actor after appearing in the title role of Jean Renoir's Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932).The Complete Jean Vigo DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, pp. 36‚Äì38. Simon stated that he accepted the role for the little-known and already controversial Vigo because he sympathized with Vigo and wanted to help his troubled career. Dita Parlo was a minor star who had just returned to France after six years in Germany. Jean Dast√© had only appeared in Zero for Conduct and Boudu Saved from Drowning before his lead role, but went on to have a long career in France. Louis Lef√®bvre had previously appeared in Zero for Conduct. Vigo was familiar with Lef√®bvre's lack of acting training and awkwardness on camera and worked those characteristics into his character in order to make Lef√®bvre's performance work. =Filming= Although scheduled to begin shooting during the summer, production did not begin until mid-November 1933. L'Atalante took four months to shoot, partially in a replica of the barge in a Gaumont studio, and partially on location.The Complete Jean Vigo DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 8. During filming, Vigo would often act out the scenes himself for the actors and insisted that they re-shoot scenes until they were perfect. Amongst the changes that Vigo made to the original script was replacing P√®re Jules' pet dog with over ten alley cats supplied by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Vigo's father had been fond of such cats and Vigo's childhood homes were often overrun with stray cats. During the scenes where P√®re Jules plays his phonograph, the cats would become immediately fascinated by the phonograph and surround it whenever it played music. Vigo quickly assembled his crew and shot footage of the cats listening to the music and sleeping inside the loud speaker. Simon later adopted the kitten that rested inside the phonograph horn. Vigo also visited local flea markets in Saint-Ouen and the scrap metal market on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir to find props for P√®re Jules' collection of artifacts from around the world. Jean Dast√© and Dita Parlo in the wedding scene, which was the first scene shot. Production began with the exteriors on location and was shot mostly in sequence. The first scene shot was the wedding sequence at Maurecourt in the Oise. The exteriors of the dance hall sequence where Juliette first meets the showman were shot at the Charentonneau dance hall in Maisons-Alfort, while the interiors were shot on an elaborate set at Gaumont studios. The character of the showman was not very developed in the shooting script and Vigo relied on improvisation on set to create a more interesting character. Because Gaumont had insisted that music be included in the film, the showman sings \\"The Pedlar's Complaint\\", a French folk song written by Vigo, Goldblatt and Jaubert that makes fun of the genre of music that they were unwillingly required to include in the film. Vigo had previously experienced bad sound quality when shooting Zero for Conduct and was concerned about a similar problem on L'Atalante despite having better equipment. Since Michel Simon had both the most dialogue in the film and a distinctly inarticulate manner of speech, Vigo had Simon adopt the character trait of repeating questions that were asked of his character. The first two weeks of location shooting began in the Oise between the Marne and the Rhine and down the Ourcq canal to the basin at La Villette. The harsh and early winter weather slowed down the shooting schedule and affected Vigo's health. Despite the cold weather, Vigo wanted to shoot at night more and more so as to use the artificial lights of the barge and houses along the canal. Vigo also needed to maintain continuity, and the cold weather was creating floating ice in the canal. In the middle of location shooting, Vigo moved the cast and crew to the replica set of the barge at Gaumont studios at La Villette, but would quickly change the day's shooting to on location whenever the weather permitted. Vigo left all transition shots to the very end of shooting, which became a major problem due to the ground then being covered with snow. Vigo shot many low angle shots that only showed the sky in the background to ameliorate this problem. By mid-January, the film was behind schedule and over budget, with several major sequences having not yet been shot. Gaumont executives blamed Vigo and pressured him to finish the film quickly and inexpensively. Vigo was forced to film documentary-style footage, such as the scene where Juliette walks past a line of real unemployed workers. Despite not having sufficient funding from Gaumont to pay extras or for locations, he was able to film the scene where Juliette is robbed at the Gare d'Austerlitz in the middle of the night with a few friends appearing as background extras. Chavance was also able to recruit members of the \\"October Group\\", such as Jacques Prevert, Pierre Prevert and Loutchimoukov, to appear in the film. =Vigo's health= On location, shooting conditions were often cold and wet, causing Vigo to become ill and develop a fever. He was already suffering from tuberculosis and was bedridden for portions of the filming. Vigo refused to take a break and would often fight with executives at Gaumont over the film. He worked until the film was almost complete and a rough cut had been made. At the end of four months of continuous shooting, in early February 1934, Vigo took a vacation in Villard-de-Lans with family and friends to try to regain his health. He intended to finish the final cut of the film, but his condition became worse and he returned to Paris to recover. The few remaining aerial shots were done by Boris Kaufman, while editor Louis Chavance finished the final cut without Vigo. Vigo's health did not improve and was confined to his bed for the remainder of his life. Dast√© later claimed that Vigo \\"made jokes all the time. Spending a day with him was wonderful and grueling, even a few weeks before his death. He was such a vivacious person.\\"The Complete Jean Vigo DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 11. Initial release and reception The film was previewed to French film distributors at the Palais Rochechouarton on 25 April 1934. The screening was disastrous and Gaumont took control of the film. Jean Pascal called the original cut \\"a confused, incoherent, willfully absurd, long, dull, commercially worthless film.\\" However, √âlie Faure said that he was reminded of the painter Jean-Baptiste- Camille Corot and praised \\"these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line. And perhaps it was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration ‚Äî classical, in a word ‚Äî that made me appreciate all the more pleasure of savoring the very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism.\\" Eventually, Gaumont cut the film's run time to 65 minutes in an attempt to make it more popular and changed the title to Le chaland qui passe (\\"The Passing Barge\\"), the name of a popular song at the time by Lys Gauty, which was also inserted into the film, replacing parts of Jaubert's score. Vigo was too weak to defend the film as his condition grew worse. When L'Atalante was released in September 1934, it was a commercial failure and received poor reviews from critics, who called it \\"amateurish, self-indulgent and morbid.\\" In October 1934, shortly after the film had finished its initial run at French movie theaters, Vigo died at the age of 29 in the arms of his wife Lydou. Allegedly, he died just as a street performer began playing \\"Le chaland qui passe\\" below his window. Legacy L'Atalante and all of Vigo's work was mostly forgotten by the late 1930s, despite L'Atalante being partially restored in 1940. Vigo's work began to be rediscovered after World War II. L'Atalante and Zero for Conduct were both re-released in New York in July 1947 and received rave reviews from film critics such as James Agee,The Complete Jean Vigo DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 13. who called Vigo \\"one of the very few real originals who have ever worked in film.\\" In the UK, Roger Manvell called Vigo \\"perhaps the most original and promising of the great French directors.\\" In Italy, Luigi Comencini obtained a personal copy of L'Atalante and would screen it for his friends, calling it \\"a masterpiece capable of shaking up any notion about cinema the average spectator might have.\\" Film critic Georges Sadoul praised \\"the astounding quality of poetry it engenders from a world superficially ordinary and drab.\\"Cook, David A. The History of Narrative Film. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, Third Edition, 1996, p. 377. . The film became a favorite of the filmmakers of the French New Wave, whose films contain many allusions to Vigo's work. The French director Fran√ßois Truffaut fell in love with it when he saw it at the age of 14 in 1946: \\"When I entered the theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work.\\" Ebert, Roger. \\"L'Atalante (1934).\\" Chicago Sun-Times, 15 October 2000. Yugoslavian film director Emir Kusturica has said he is a big admirer of Vigo's work and describes Vigo as a poet. This admiration is best shown in Kusturica's Underground (1995), where the underwater scenes are very reminiscent of those from L'Atalante.\\"Keys for underground: Jean Vigo.\\" kustu.com. Retrieved: 23 December 2012. Other films to pay tribute to L'Atalante include Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris (1972), Leos Carax's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf (1991), and Jean-Luc Godard's In Praise of Love (2001).The Complete Jean Vigo DVD Linear Notes. The Criterion Collection, 2011, p. 16. L'Atalante was restored in 1990 for Gaumont by Jean- Louis Bompoint and Pierre Philippe. This restoration was aided in large part by the discovery of a 1934 copy of the film in the British National Film and Television Archive, as well as by rushes and rare material from the French Cinematheque and sequences from a copy of Le Chaland Qui Passe held by the Royal Belgian Cinematheque. In response to criticisms of this restoration, a fifth re-edit was made 2001 by Bernard Eisenchitz and Luce Vigo (the director's daughter) that made some changes and improvements to the 1990 version. The 2001 restoration appears in Criterion's The Complete Jean Vigo; it also appeared on Artificial Eye's UK edition in 2004 and L'int√©grale Jean Vigo in 2001. A new 4K restoration was finished in 2017 by Gaumont. L'Atalante was chosen as the 10th-greatest film of all time in the British journal Sight & Sounds 1962 poll, and as the sixth-best in its 1992 poll. In the 2002 poll, it ranked 17th, with 15 critics and directors (including Jim Jarmusch) naming it as one of their 10 favorite films. In 2012 it was ranked 12th on the critics poll with 58 votes, including David Thomson, Geoff Andrew and Craig Keller. Musician Steve Adey wrote a song called \\"Dita Parlo\\" on his 2012 studio album The Tower of Silence. The song was written in response to L'Atalante.

The purpose of the snap shot is to combine the main advantages of the wrist shot (shot accuracy and quick delivery) and slap shot (puck speed). The snap shot is accomplished with a quick snap of the wrists while the puck rests in place. The difference between a snap shot and a wrist shot is that the stick blade is accelerated towards the puck from a small distance behind it. This allows the player to flex the shaft on the ice and strike the puck at speed ‚Äì although not to the degree of a full slap shot. The stick is usually not lifted higher than the knee during the shot, which makes this shot legal in most old-timer hockey leagues despite its rapid pace. Snap shots are the most common shot taken when the crease player receives the pass and decides not to one-time the puck. The snap shot is often considered a compromise between the wrist shot and slap shot, and can sometimes be mistaken for one or the other due to its inherently deceptive nature. Consequently, while many players are renowned for their wrist shots (e.g. Alexei Kovalev, Joe Sakic, Teemu Sel√§nne, Pavel Bure, Paul Kariya) or slap shots (heavy claps) (e.g. Zdeno Ch√°ra, Al MacInnis, Bobby Hull, Brett Hull, Shea Weber, Sheldon Souray), few players are known for exceptional snap shots. Among the players who often score on snap shots are Joe Sakic, Teemu Sel√§nne, Steven Stamkos, Alexander Ovechkin, Ilya Kovalchuk and Phil Kessel.

History In 1866 Pope Pius IX, whose temporal domain had been reduced to only the province of Latium, decided to join the Latin Monetary Union. A new currency, the lira, was introduced with the same value of the French franc and the Italian lira. It replaced the scudo at a rate of 5.375 lire = 1 scudo : the rate was calculated thanks to the silver value of the old scudo (26.9 grams of silver, with 9/10 of purity) and the new lira (5 grams of silver, with 9/10 of purity). However, the Pope's treasurer, Giacomo Antonelli, devalued the purity of the Papal coins from 900/1000 to 835/1000, causing big problems for the Union, which later was forced to adopt the new standard. With the annexation of Rome to Italy in 1870, the Papal lira was replaced by the Italian lira at par. The lira was subdivided into 100 cents (Italian: centesimo) and, differently from the other currencies of the union, into 20 shillings (Italian: soldo). However, all denomination in shillings had an equivalence in cents. Coins Copper coins were issued in denominations of 1 cent, ¬Ω, (=2.5 cents), 1 (=5 cents), 2 (=10 cents) and 4 (= 20 cents) shillings, with silver 5 (=25 cents) and 10 (=50 cents) shillings, 1, 2, 2¬Ω and 5 lire, and gold 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 lire.

Wanting to become a movie cameraman, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to study cinematography and business at Saint Louis University, where he sold records by mail order from his dormitory room. He was a founding member of the St. Louis Jazz Club, through which he met Ron Fister, another record collector. Koester and Fister opened a small record store, K & F Sales. On moving to bigger premises they renamed it Blue Note Record Shop. After nearly a year together, Koester and Fister decided to split their business and Koester founded Delmar Records, on Delmar Blvd. Delmar first recorded a traditional jazz group in 1953 and then searched out and recorded blues musicians of the 1920s and 1930s (Speckled Red, Big Joe Williams, J.D. Short, and James Crutchfield among others) who were living in St. Louis. The name of the label was changed from Delmar to Delmark, partly because of copyright issues. Koester moved to Chicago in 1958. He purchased Seymour's Jazz Mart, in the Roosevelt University Building, from Seymour Schwartz in 1959. In 1963, he relocated the Jazz Record Mart and Delmark Records to 7 West Grand Avenue. In 1971, he purchased premises at 4243 N. Lincoln Avenue and moved Delmark there. In 1996, Koester was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. The Jazz Record Mart moved to 27 East Illinois in 2006. The rent at that location ultimately proved too costly, and Koester closed the store after selling off its entire inventory to Wolfgang's Vault. He reopened the store in the Horner Park neighborhood at the end of April, 2016, in the front room of his Delmark Records studio at 4121 N.

History In his book State of War, author and intelligence correspondent for The New York Times James Risen relates that the CIA chose a defected Russian nuclear scientist to provide deliberately flawed nuclear warhead blueprints to Iranian officials in February 2000. According to CIA documents, the search for a suitable Russian emigre with an engineering background in nuclear physics and production began in September 1996. The Russian emigre selected was first contacted by the CIA in August 1994, and received a monthly salary of US$5,000 (plus travel expenses) in 1997 and 1998, which was raised to US$6,000 beginning in February 1999. The weapon component selected was based on the Russian TBA-480 Fire Set (High Voltage Automatic Block), which was modified in an attempt to make it \\"fatally flawed\\". The CIA estimated that the TBA-480 Fire Set, which had been developed at Arzamas-16, was 20 years more advanced than anything required to get a first generation nuclear weapon operational. After the delivery of the designs to Iran on March 3, 2000, the CIA extended the employment of the Russian emigre to at least March 2003, with the intention of conveying the flawed TBA-480 plans to another country suspected of interest in developing nuclear weapons. Risen wrote in his book that President Clinton had approved the operation and that the Bush administration later endorsed the plan. Earlier publication of details on Operation Merlin by the New York Times in 2003 was prevented by the intervention of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice with the NYTs Executive Editor Howell Raines. =Backfire= Operation Merlin backfired when the CIA's Russian contact/messenger noticed flaws in the schematics and told the Iranian nuclear scientists. Instead of crippling Iran's nuclear program, the book alleges, Operation Merlin may have accelerated it by providing useful information: once the flaws were identified, the plans could be compared with other sources, such as those presumed to have been provided to the Iranians by A. Q. Khan. Indictment, conviction of former CIA officer In late 2010, former CIA officer Jeffrey Alexander Sterling was indicted for allegedly being the source of some of the information in Risen's book, and was convicted of espionage in January 2015. He was convicted and sentenced to years in prison.

M. Forster's novel of the same name (1908). It stars Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy and Julian Sands as George, and features Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliott, Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench and Simon Callow in supporting roles. Set in England and Italy, it is about a young woman named Lucy Honeychurch in the restrictive and repressed culture of Edwardian England, and her developing love for a free-spirited young man, George Emerson. The film closely follows the novel by use of chapter titles to distinguish thematic segments. A Room with a View received universal critical acclaim and was a box-office success. At the 59th Academy Awards, it was nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture), and won three: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Costume Design. It also won five British Academy Film Awards and a Golden Globe. In 1999, the British Film Institute placed A Room with a View 73rd on its list of the Top 100 British films of the 20th century. Plot In 1907, a young English girl, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter), and her spinster cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith), stay at the Pensione Bertolini while on holiday in Florence. They are disappointed their rooms lack a view of the Arno as promised. At dinner, they meet other English guests: the Reverend Mr Beebe (Simon Callow), two elderly spinster sisters, the Misses Alan (Fabia Drake and Joan Henley), the romance author, Eleanor Lavish (Judi Dench), the freethinking Mr Emerson (Denholm Elliott) and his handsome philosophical son, George (Julian Sands). Learning about Charlotte and Lucy's view predicament, Mr Emerson and George offer to exchange rooms, though Charlotte considers the suggestion indelicate. Mr Beebe mediates, and the switch is made. While touring the Piazza della Signoria the next day, Lucy witnesses a local man being brutally stabbed. She faints but George Emerson appears and comes to her aid. When Lucy has recovered, the two have a personal discussion before returning to the pensione. Later, Charlotte, Lucy, and the Emersons join other British tourists for a day trip to the Fiesole countryside. Charlotte and Eleanor Lavish engage in conversation considered \\"unsuitable\\" for young ladies, so Lucy goes looking for Mr. Beebe. Instead, the Italian driver mistakenly leads her to where George is admiring the view from a hillside. Seeing Lucy, he suddenly embraces and passionately kisses her. Charlotte appears and intervenes. Worried that Lucy's mother will consider her an inadequate chaperone, Charlotte swears Lucy to secrecy and cuts their trip short. Upon returning to Surrey in England, Lucy says nothing to her mother about the incident and pretends to forget it. She is soon engaged to Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis), a wealthy and socially prominent man who is snobbish and pretentious. Cecil loves Lucy but he and his mother consider the Honeychurch family as their inferiors, dismaying Mrs Honeychurch. Lucy soon learns that Mr Emerson is moving into Sir Harry Otway's rental cottage, with George visiting on weekends. Lucy intended for the two Misses Alan to live there and is cross with Cecil upon learning that through a chance meeting with the Emersons in London, Cecil recommended the cottage to them. He proclaims his motive was to annoy Sir Harry, who Cecil considers a snob, and believes will find the Emersons as being \\"too common\\". George's presence upends Lucy's life, and her suppressed feelings for him surface. Meanwhile, Lucy's brother, Freddy (Rupert Graves), has become friends with George. Freddy invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner, the Honeychurch home, during which Cecil mockingly reads aloud from Miss Lavish's latest novel set in Italy. Cecil, still reading, is oblivious when George passionately kisses Lucy in the garden. As Cecil continues reading aloud, Lucy recognizes a scene as being identical to her and George's encounter in Fiesole. She confronts Charlotte, who admits to telling Miss Lavish, who used it in her story. Lucy orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. He says that Cecil sees her only as a possession and will never love her for herself, as he would. Lucy seems unmoved, but soon after ends her engagement to Cecil, saying they are incompatible. To escape the ensuing fallout, she arranges to travel to Greece with the Misses Alan. George, unable to be around Lucy, arranges for his father to move to London, unaware Lucy is no longer engaged. When Lucy stops by Mr Beebe's home to fetch Charlotte, she is confronted by Mr. Emerson, who happens to be there. She finally realizes her true feelings for George. At the end, newlyweds George and Lucy honeymoon at the Italian pensione where they met, in the room with a view, overlooking Florence's Duomo. Cast =Background= E. M. Forster began to write A Room with a View during a trip to Italy in the winter of 1901‚Äì02 when he was twenty-two. It was the first novel he worked on, however, he put it away before returning to it a few years later. Forster finished first two other novels: Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905) and then The Longest Journey (1907). A Room with a View was finally published in 1908. Set in Italy and England, A Room with a View follows Lucy Honeychurch, a proper young Englishwoman who discovers passion while on a trip to Italy. At her return to the restrained culture of Edwardian-era England, she must choose between two opposite men: the free-thinking George Emerson and the repressed aesthete Cecil Vyse. The story is both a romance and a humorous critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. The novel, Forster's third, was very well received, better than his previous two, but it is considered lighter than his two best-regarded later works Howards End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924). In Forster's own appreciation \\"A Room with a View, may not be his best, but may very well be his nicest\\". Forster's early draft of the novel, entitled Lucy, has the triangle of Lucy, Miss Bartlett, and a shadowy George Emerson already in place, as well as the two Miss Alans and the novelist, Miss Lavish. In these first notes, the story begins in the Pensione Bertolini in Florence but breaks off before the return to England, and its various sketchy episodes bear little resemblance to the finished work. In 1903, Forster went on with his novel, and now Cecil Vyse makes his appearance, as well as old Mr. Emerson, Reverend Beebe, and Lucy's mother and brother Freddy. The action, commencing in Italy as before, is carried forward to England, but the plot was unresolved when Forster laid the novel away for the second time. In this version, the story ended with George riding his bicycle into a tree during a storm. These early drafts have been published by Edward Arnold in The Lucy Novels (1977), edited by Oliver Stallybrass. In it, one may follow to some extent the development of the novel. He liked, too, the character of Lucy Honeychurch and, somewhat dyspeptically comparing her with the women in Howards End (1910), counting her as one of his few successes. The character of Lucy anticipates that of Adela Quested in A Passage To India, published in 1924. Both women seem to be fighting their own best natures, to be hysterically turning away from any kind of honest introspection, and at a crucial point in the story, to be embarking on an enterprise which will plunge them and everyone who loves them into misery. The Lucy Novels also contain some bits that were used in the film, not in the published novel. The scene between Lucy and the guide in Santa Croce, for instance, with its mishmash of Italian and pidgin English, is from Forster's notebook. It is revealing, too, about the originals of some of the characters: George Emerson began as Forster's Cambridge friend, Hugh Meredith, Forster designating the character by the initials H.O.M. in his notes. As a type, Miss Lavish was based on Emily Spender, a writer Forster and his mother met in their travels, swinging about in a military cape and affecting thin cigars in the pensione smoking room. In 1946, 20th Century Fox offered $25.000 for the film rights to A Room with a View, but Forster did not hold cinema in high regard and refused even though the studio was willing to pay him even more.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 119 Following Forster's death in 1970, the board of fellows of King's College at Cambridge inherited the rights to his books.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 211 However, Donald A Parry, chief executor, turned down all approaches. Ten years later, the film rights for Forster's novels became available when the film enthusiast Professor Bernard Williams became chief executor.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 79 The trustees of Forster's estate invited producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory to Cambridge to discuss filming Forster. Merchant and Ivory surprised their hosts with their interest in A Room with a View, which the fellows of King's College considered \\"A little inconsequential early novel\\", rather than A Passage to India, which was generally considered to be the writer's best. Merchant and Ivory had no interest in A Passage to India because they had just done a British Raj film: Heat and Dust was released in 1983. For Merchant and Ivory, A Room with a View was their breakthrough to broader success. =Casting= The role of Lucy Honeychurch was Helena Bonham Carter's breakthrough as a film actress.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 204 She was nineteen at the time and had just finished the art-house film Lady Jane (1986).Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 203 Ivory gave her the role as he found \\"she was very quick, very smart, and very beautiful\\". She fit Forster's description of Lucy as \\"a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face\\" . Rupert Everett auditioned for the role of Cecil Vyse. He would rather have played George Emerson, but Ivory thought that he was not quite right for it. It was Julian Sands who was cast as the male lead. Sands had gained notice as the British photographer in The Killing Fields (1984). Daniel Day-Lewis came to the attention of Ivory though his role in the play Another Country as the gay student Guy Bennet.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 81 Given the choice of either George Emerson or Cecil Vyse, he took on the more challenging role of Cecil.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 82 The role of Freddy Honeychurch, Lucy's brother, went to Rupert Graves, in his film debut. He had had a minor role as one of the schoolboys in the play Another Country. Simon Callow had been Ivory's original choice for the character of Harry Hamilton-Paul, the friend of the Nawab, in the Merchant Ivory film Heat and Dust, but had committed to a play in London's West End. He had created the role of Mozart in the original London stage production of Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979) and made his film debut in a small role in the film adaptation. In A Room with a View, he was cast as the vicar Mr. Beebe.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 83 The supporting cast included veteran performers: Five years earlier, Maggie Smith had worked in another Merchant Ivory film, Quartet.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 206 Denholm Elliott was known for his role as Indiana Jones' friend Marcus Brody, the museum curator, in Raiders of the Lost Ark. With a prominent theater career, Judi Dench had made her film debut in 1964, but she took the supporting role of Eleanor Lavish. (She would later become widely known after her starring role in the 1997 film Mrs Brown.) Dench and Ivory had disagreements during the filming of A Room with a View because, among other things, he suggested that she play her character as a Scot.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 207 Filming The film was made on a budget of $3 million that included investment by Cinecom in the U.S, and from Goldcrest Films, The National Finance Corporation, and Curzon Film Distributors in Great Britain.Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 138 A Room with a View was shot extensively on location in Florence, where Merchant Ivory had the Piazza della Signoria cleared for filming.Long, The Films of Merchant Ivory, p. 139 Villa di Maiano in Fiesole served as the Pensione Bertolini.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 91 From its decoration of the walls they asked a painter to do a series of decorative artworks called grotesques that were used for titles between sections of the film, like chapter headings, following chapter titles in Forster's novel.Ingersollg, Filming Forster, p. 92 Other scenes were filmed in London and around the town of Sevenoaks in Kent where they borrowed the Kent family estate of film critic John Pym for their country scenes. Lucy's engagement party was filmed in the grounds of Emmetts Garden. Foxwold House near Chiddingstone was used for the Honeychurch house and an artificial pond was built in the forest of the property to use as the Sacred Lake. Two years later, the Great Storm of 1987 would tear through the area and destroy the gardens and almost 80 acres of the surrounding forest. In London, the Linley Sambourne House in South Kensington was used for Cecil's house and the Estonian Legation on Queensway was used for the boarding house where the Miss Alans live. In all, A Room with a View was shot in ten weeks: four in Italy and six in England.Long, James Ivory in Conversation, p. 199 Reception =Critical reception= The film received positive reviews from critics, currently holding a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.42/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The hard edges of E.M Forster novel may be sanded off, but what we get with A Room with a View is an eminently entertaining comedy with an intellectual approach to love\\". Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, writing: \\"It is an intellectual film, but intellectual about emotions: It encourages us to think about how we feel, instead of simply acting on our feelings.\\" A Room With a View appeared on 61 critics' ten-best lists in 1986, making it one of the most acclaimed films of the year. Only Hannah and Her Sisters appeared on more lists. =Box office= The film made $4.4 million at the US box office in the first 12 weeks of release. Goldcrest Films invested ¬£460,000 in the film and earned ¬£1,901,000 meaning they made a profit of ¬£1,441,000. Awards A Room with a View was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three, for Jhabvala's adaptation of Forster's novel as well as for Best Costume and Best Production Design. It was the first unrated film in the United States to receive a Best Picture nomination. A Room With a View was also voted Best Film of the year by the Critics' Circle Film Section of Great Britain, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the National Board of Review in the United States and in Italy, where the film won the Donatello Prize for Best Foreign Language Picture and Best Director.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions at Kalamata on 29 April 1941 during the Battle of Greece. Born in 1909, Hinton was a foreman at the Public Works Department when the Second World War began. He volunteered for service abroad with the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force and was posted to the 20th Battalion. Wounded during the fighting at Kalamata, he was made a prisoner of war and made several escape attempts from camps in Germany. He was freed in April 1945 by advancing American forces. After the war, he managed several hotels and was also involved in horse racing industry until his retirement in 1980. He died in 1997 at the age of 87. Early life John Hinton, known as Jack, was born in Colac Bay in Southland, New Zealand, on 17 September 1909, one of seven children of Harry Hinton, a railway man, and Elizabeth Mary. He was educated at local schools and on most days, before starting lessons, would milk a herd of 40 cows. When he was 12, he ran away from home after an argument with his father. He found a job at a grocer's in a nearby town but after a year signed on as a galleyhand aboard a Norwegian whaling ship, which spent the 1921/1922 whaling season in the Southern Ocean. On his return, and after reconciling with his parents, he started working as a shepherd. He soon tired of this and began the life of a swagman, working from town to town as he travelled around the South Island. Hinton spent most of the next several years on the West Coast working in railroad construction, mining for gold, picking fruit, hauling coal, and saw milling. Sport was a passion; he boxed as a lightweight and also ran foot races and played rugby for Hokitika. In the 1930s, Hinton found regular employment in the Public Works Department, which was building bridges and roads throughout the West Coast. He gained respect for his honesty and hard- working nature and became a foreman in the department. In 1937, he invested his earnings into a pub for which his future wife, Eunice Henriksen, had the lease. World War II Hinton military history Sheet from personnel file (1939 - 1957) At the outbreak of war, Hinton enlisted in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was being raised for service abroad. He was posted to the 20th Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Kippenberger, and based at Burnham Military Camp. One of the older volunteers of the battalion, he was soon promoted to the rank of corporal, and not long after was made a sergeant. The battalion embarked for the Middle East as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Division, in January 1940. Hinton was not always respectful of military authority. Shortly after the New Zealanders arrived in Egypt, he was commanding a squad practising on a rifle range when visited by the division's commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, who asked him how the men were shooting. \\"How would you expect them to bloody well shoot?\\", replied Hinton, \\"not enough bloody rations, stinking heat and sand\\". Freyberg asked him to repeat the comment, which he did word for word. Freyberg took note of Hinton's name and instructed him to carry on. There was a subsequent increase in rations, while Hinton was advised by his company commander on how best to speak to senior officers. =Battle of Greece= In March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one of several Allied units deployed to Greece to help prepare for an expected invasion by Italian and German troops. When the invasion began on 6 April 1941, the 20th Battalion briefly saw action at Thermopylae before being withdrawn, but Hinton missed this fighting as he was with the division's reinforcement battalion, which was initially based in Athens before it moved to the port of Kalamata. It had been decided that the Allied forces would abandon Greece; at Kalamata, the reinforcement battalion, along with several thousand other, mainly Australian, troops, was awaiting evacuation. On 28 April, the New Zealanders were waiting for transport when advance units of the German 5th Panzer Division began to attack the town with machine-gun fire and self-propelled 6-inch guns. Hearing gunfire in the distance, Hinton, wanting to assist in the defence of the Allied positions, went to the headquarters of Brigadier Leonard Parrington, the officer in command of the evacuation. Hinton vehemently protested, in strong language, an order from Parrington to surrender. On being threatened with a court-martial for speaking to a senior officer in such a manner, he issued his own threat of proceedings against Parrington for defeatist talk and then left to determine for himself the situation. Other men of the reinforcement battalion were making preparations to move into the town and face the Germans. In the meantime, Hinton had collected his own party of 12 soldiers and led them into the town but came under fire. Ignoring an order from a nearby officer to retreat, he rushed forward to the nearest enemy gun and, hurling two grenades, killed the crew. He continued towards the town's waterfront, clearing out two light machine-gun nests and a mortar with grenades, then dealt with the garrison of a house where some of the enemy were sheltering. He then assisted in the capture of an artillery piece, but shortly after was shot in the stomach, immobilised and captured, one of about 6,000 Allied soldiers made a prisoner of war (POW). Officially listed as missing in action until August 1941, Hinton spent several weeks in a hospital near Athens until he was well enough to be transferred to a POW camp in Germany. In the meantime, a recommendation for the Victoria Cross (VC) for Hinton was dispatched by Major George Thomson, a medical officer who had witnessed his actions in Kalamata. After an investigation, a decision was made to award Hinton the VC, which was duly gazetted on 14 October 1941. The citation read as follows: =Prisoner of war= The announcement of Hinton's VC was made within a week of Lieutenant Charles Upham, another member of the 20th Battalion, being awarded a VC for his actions during the fighting in the Battle of Crete. This prompted a joke that circulated within the battalion: \\"Join the 20th and get a VC.\\" While a prisoner of war at Stalag IX-C, Hinton made several escape attempts. He was being punished with solitary confinement for one such attempt when his VC was gazetted. He was paraded before his fellow prisoners and presented with a VC ribbon by the camp's commandant before being returned to his cell to complete his punishment. In 1944, even though a prisoner of war, Hinton was contacted by the International Red Cross to pass on a request from the Labour Party. It asked him to consider standing as their candidate in a by-election in Awarua. He had previously signaled his interest in pursuing a career in politics. However, he was unable to confirm his candidacy in time. By April 1945, the Allied advance into Germany threatened Hinton's POW camp. The Germans evacuated the camp but Hinton, feigning sickness, remained behind. Once the guards had left, he was able to find keys to the gates and let himself out. He soon made contact with soldiers of the United States 6th Armoured Division. Dressed in civilian clothes, he was initially treated with suspicion but soon convinced the Americans of his identity. He borrowed an American uniform and went forward to the frontline with the 44th Infantry Division and assisted in the capture of three villages and rounding up of German POWs. Senior American officers soon found out about Hinton's presence with their troops and sent him to England, where he arrived on 12 April 1945. Hinton remained in England for over three months, awaiting repatriation to New Zealand. During this time, on 11 May 1945, he received his VC from King George VI at an investiture held at Buckingham Palace. Charles Upham, his comrade from the 20th Battalion, received a bar to his VC at the same ceremony. Transport finally available, Hinton departed for New Zealand in early July and arrived on 4 August 1945. Later life and legacy After returning home, Hinton initially was indecisive about what to do with his life. Like many of his fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt to civilian life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of his status as a VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels. During his time as a hotelier, Hinton made several overseas trips, the first of which was to attend the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He also regularly attended VC and George Cross celebrations, including the VC centenary in 1956. In 1963, Eunice, who Jack had married following the death of her first husband in the 1950s, died from a heart attack. In 1968, he was married again, to Molly Schumacher, a barmaid at the Onehunga Hotel in Auckland, which Hinton was running at the time. While in Auckland, he was heavily involved in the horse racing industry and acted as a steward at the Auckland Trotting Club. alt=a bronze plaque headstone set in a block of concrete amongst grass, with flowers in the foreground Hinton retired in 1980 and he and Molly moved to Ashburton in the South Island. He spent much of his retirement fishing and in 1990 shifted to Christchurch to be nearer to Molly's relatives. He died on 28 June 1997 and was honoured with a military funeral, attended by 800 people. The Chief of General Staff, Major General Piers Reid, delivered a eulogy. The New Zealand Parliament honoured him with a minute's silence at a sitting on 1 July 1997. He was survived by his second wife; he had no children from either of his marriages. He is buried in Christchurch, in the Returned Servicemen's League Section of the Ruru Lawn Cemetery. He is remembered with a plaque in his birthplace of Colac Bay, and the restaurant at the Christchurch Returned Servicemen's Association is named for him. Hinton's VC was loaned by his family to the Army Museum New Zealand at Waiouru, where it is on display. On 2 December 2007, it was one of nine VCs among a hundred medals stolen from the museum. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

Medieval Palatine judges In the Middle Ages, the judices palatini (papal palace judges) were the highest administrative officers of the pope's household; with the growth of the temporal power of the popes they acquired great importance. These judices palatini were * chief were the primicerius notariorum and secundarius notariorum, the two superintendents of the papal notarii (notaries), who superintended the preparation of official documents, conducted judicial investigations and exercised jurisdiction in legal matters voluntarily submitted by the interested parties to the papal court; they were the highest officers of the papal Chancery and of the archives of the Lateran Palace. * the nomenculator or adminiculator (originally perhaps two distinct officials), who took charge of, and decided upon, petitions to the pope. (The nomenculator was superseded in the course of the ninth century by the protoscriniarius, or superintendent of the Roman public schools for scribes.) *The arcarius and sacellarius were the highest financial officers, custodians of the treasures of the pope's Lateran Palace, who had charge of the receipt and payment of moneys. The vestararius was the third financial office. * The primicerius defensorum and secundicerius defensorum, being superintendents of the defensores, who aided and protected widows, orphans, captives and other needy persons, had the supervision of charitable institutions. These various offices developed from the end of the fourth century, with the formation of the papal household. Their functions covered the whole central administration of the papacy, both at Rome and in the outlying possessions (patrimonia) of the Roman Church. The judices palatini were also employed as papal envoys; they also had definite duties in the solemn processions and other great church ceremonies at which the pope was present in person. Their authority continued down until the middle of the eleventh century, when the reforms of the papal administration, inaugurated after the troubles of the tenth century, placed the Cardinals in that position at the Roman curia, which the judices palatini had previously occupied, and the latter gradually disappeared. Later papal palatini In later times the designation palatini was borne by certain cardinals, whose position brought them into constant relation with the pope, and who resided in the papal palace, and by the highest prelates of the pope's personal suite. For long the cardinales palatini were: the cardinal prodatary, the Cardinal Secretary of State, the Cardinal Secretary of Briefs and the Cardinal Secretary of Memorials. Pope Pius X (1903‚Äì1914) abolished the two last- mentioned positions, and Pope Paul VI abolished the Apostolic Dataria in 1967. The praelati palatini were: * the majordomo (maggiordomo) * the high chamberlain (maestro di camera) * the auditor of the pope (uditore santissimo) * the pope's theologian (maestro del sacro palazzo), who is always a Dominican. Lay counterparts * In the times of the French kings and of the German emperors, there were comites palatini, counts palatine who originally presided in the High Courts of Justice of a palatinate as representatives of the Crown. * In Germany the counts palatine were entrusted, after Otto I (931‚Äì73), with the supervision of the imperial lands and revenues, and were also imperial judges. The court officials bearing this title, introduced by Emperor Charles IV (1346‚Äì78), had various powers, partly judicial, partly administrative. * In medieval Poland a Palatyn (Palatinus) was initially the highest title at the King's court. Later, every local Prince had his own Palatinus, often the actual ruler of a Duchy. With the partial reunification of the Kingdom the ducal Palatini remained in their place and ruled the Principalities (later renamed to Palatinates, Palatinatus) under the King. The title got merged with that of Wojewoda (Dux Exercituum, Herzog). A son of a Palatinus was titled Wojewodzic (Palatinida) and would often become a Palatinus at his father's death, but these titles never became officially hereditary and formally remained granted for lifetime by the King. In the early 20th century, the palatinal families (rodziny wojewodzi≈Ñskie, descendants of the Palatini), remained the highest strata of Poland's aristocracy.

He is the founding mainstay guitarist for Dirty Three and has had art exhibitions around Australia and internationally. Previously he was a member of the Moodists (1983‚Äì84) and Venom P. Stinger. He has released four solo studio albums, Tren Phantasma (1997), Marlan Rosa (1999), Moth (2003) and Don't tell the Driver (2013). Biography Michael Jonathan Turner, born in 1960, grew up in Black Rock, Victoria. In 1979, Turner (as Mick Sick), on guitar, formed Sick Things in Melbourne alongside Gary Hirst (as Gary Sick) on drums, Dugald Mackenzie (as Dugald Bluuuugh) on vocals and Geoff Martyr (as Geoff Sick) on bass guitar. Tim Peacock of Record Collector magazine opined that the group were \\"Arguably the city's rawest hardcore outfit\\". They recorded a single, \\"Committed to Suicide\\" (1985) before Turner and Mackenzie left in 1982. It also appeared on their posthumous album, The Sounds of Silence on Shock Records (1989). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt that \\"the records featured ferocious guitar riffs and distorted vocals, displaying the band's penchant for flat-out, Black Flag-style hardcore punk.\\" Turner and Mackenzie co-wrote the track, \\"Where's My Dole Cheque\\", which appeared on another posthumous album, My Life Is a Mess (May 1999). In 1982 Turner formed Fungus Brains as a proto-grunge and punk rock group with Simon Adams on bass guitar, Peter Maddick on trumpet, Geoff Marks on vocals and saxophone, Simon Sleigh on guitar and drums, and Andrew Walpole on drums and guitar. Their debut album, Ron Pistos Real World, was released in 1983. McFarlane described it as \\"a stylistic collision of punk, Birthday Party trappings, avant no-wave jazzy noise and a dozen other reference points.\\" That group went into hiatus when Turner joined the Moodists, in April 1983. The Moodists were a rock group which had formed in 1980, with Turner aboard the line-up was Dave Graney on lead vocals, Steve Miller on guitar, Clare Moore on drums and Chris Walsh on bass guitar. McFarlane specified that Turner was \\"adding his squalling guitar work to the band's unnerving, avant-garage rock noise.\\" In October 1983, as a member of the Moodists, Turner relocated to London. They issued their debut studio album, Thirsty's Calling, in April 1984. The Moodists toured Europe and the United States before returning to Australia in November that year. They supported the Australian leg of a tour by UK group, Public Image Ltd, after which Turner left to reconvene Fungus Brains. Fungus Brains released a self-titled album in 1986 but Turner had already left to form Venom P. Stinger in 1985, as an avant-rock group with former bandmate Mackenzie on lead vocals (ex-Sick Things, Brainshack), Alan Secher-Jensen on bass guitar (ex-Brainshack, Beachnuts) and Jim White on drums (ex-People with Chairs Up Their Noses, Feral Dinosaurs). McFarlane explained that the group \\"took the experimental avant-garde route to its logical conclusion with an unnerving sound that thrived on raw energy, a complex rhythmic base and unconventional song structures.\\" Their debut album, Meet My Friend Venom, was issued in January 1987, which contained \\"clattering slices of avant-rock with absolutely no concession to commercial gains.\\" Marc Masters of Pitchfork felt it is \\"a marvel of primal thrust, tearing through the air so forcefully you often feel like you're just catching its smoke trails.\\" The album was followed by a single, \\"Walking About\\", in July 1988. By 1989 Fungus Brains were reactivated with Turner and Walpole joined by Paula Henderson on saxophone (ex-White Cross), Ricky Howell on lead vocals and Peter Villiger on bass guitar. This line-up issued another album, I'm So Glad, in 1990 before Turner returned to Venom P. Stinger. That group released their second album, What's Yours is Mine, in October 1990. They followed with a four-track extended play, Waiting Room in November 1991. Venom P. Stinger toured the US and recorded a live album, Live (in Davis) (1982) in Davis, California. Early in 1992, back in Melbourne, Turner, on lead and bass guitar, and White, on drums, formed an instrumental trio, Dirty Three, with Warren Ellis on violin and bass guitar (ex-These Future Kings in 1986). Their first performance was at the Baker's Arms hotel in Abbotsford in April 1992. During late 1992 to early the following year Turner's living room was used as a recording studio, Scuzz Studio, for the group's first cassette album. Eight of its twelve tracks were produced and engineered by Turner, with the other four tracks by Julian Wu. Turner runs Dirty Three's record label, Anchor & Hope Records and has provided the cover art for all of their major albums after the first. Since 2003 Turner has had his artwork displayed in galleries in Australia, UK, US, Italy and Ireland. Outside of his work for Dirty Three, Turner issued his debut solo album, Tren Phantasma, on US label, Drag City, in September 1997. Prior to that Venom P. Stinger had issued their final album, Tear Bucket, in 1996. Turner with White formed an instrumental rock duo, the Tren Brothers, in 1998, which released singles and extended plays. The Tren Brothers were also the backing band for Cat Power, Boxhead Ensemble and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. Turner's second solo studio album, Marlan Rosa, was issued in 1999. Jessica Billey supplied violins. McFarlane declared that it was \\" a rough-hewn album of 15 instrumentals with scratchy guitar and mysterious atmospherics.\\" Alex Nosek of Oz Music Project described its \\"fifteen semi-improvised bundles of gentle aural bliss. Aside from the guitar, countless other noise making devices have been used. In fact, it is Turners' knack for looping and/or arranging the most delicious of fragile and sometimes unorthodox sound that gives this recording such an amazing feel.\\" Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian rock music journalist, compared his solo effort with his work for the trio \\"In Dirty Three, alongside the lashings of storm, there's also moody calm. That's Mick Turner's part in the equation. If music is a sea, Dirty Three is the waves crashing against the rocks in a strong wind. Mick Turner's solo music is the water breaking against the rocks, swirling around restlessly trying to find calm, before being thrown back into turbulance by another onslaught.\\" Turner has also released two albums with Billey under the moniker, Bonnevill, Travels in Constants, Vol. 2 (1999) and Pelican (2001). As well as a single, \\"Swing Pts. 1&2\\" (2000), credited to Tren Brothers & Sister which comprises Turner, White and Billey. When Turner performs his solo work, he is accompanied by one of several Melbourne drummers including Ian Wadley (of Bird Blobs), or Marty Brown (from Art of Fighting). Turner's third solo album, Moth (2002), was described by Pitchfork's William Bowers as Turner \\"strikes chords with a kind of rolling, prophetic brush. He plucks strings as if he's confidently repairing or cleaning them with nervous tools. Yet there's something 'organic' about his leapfrogging tranquilly up the fretboard's stream. His arpeggios sound like they're stumbling home from ex-lovers' porches. Middle Eastern influences are detectable, but clouded with purposeful imprecisions. Here and there the songs seem composed, but Turner's apparently reading from Polaroids instead of sheet music. The pieces' only flaw is that they're often abbreviated, as if Turner fliply stopped the tape.\\" In November 2013 Turner played at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. His fourth solo album Don't tell the Driver (2013), has guest performances from Caroline Kennedy-McCracken and Oliver Mann. Thom Jurek of AllMusic compared it to his previous work, \\"retains his singular guitar style ‚Äì an elliptical meld of implied melody gradually coaxed from fingerpicked chords and restrained strummed strings ‚Äì all told, it's unlike anything he's done before.\\" Discography = Albums = ;The Sick Things * The Sounds of Silence (recorded 1980‚Äì81, Shock Records, 1989) * My Life Is a Mess (recorded 1980‚Äì81, May 1999) ;The Fungus Brains * Ron Pisto's Real World (Dr. Jim's Records, 1983) * The Fungus Brains (Crash Records, 1986) * I'm So Glad (Magnetic Records, 1989) ;The Moodists * Thirsty's Calling (Red Flame Records, April 1984) * Double Life (Red Flame Records, 1985) (UK only) ;Venom P.

The oldest is Sacred Heart College, which started on February 7, 1873, when Presentation Sisters began teaching children at the order's Launceston convent. The Christian Brothers opened St Patrick's Christian Brothers' College at York Street on February 3, 1919, and in March 1938 the Sisters of St. Joseph founded St Thomas More's School at Newstead. On March 3, 1978, Sacred Heart College and St Thomas More merged to form Marian College. In 1984, St Patrick's College became a co-educational secondary school when the secondary classes from Marian College were transferred to St Patrick's. In 1987, St Patrick's Preparatory School (boys, Grade 3-6) joined with Sacred Heart School (co-educational to Grade 2, then girls only). The newly combined Sacred Heart School continues as a co-educational primary school today. In 1998, Year 7 classes left St Thomas More's Newstead campus and joined the other classes at Prospect. Facilities St Patrick's College is situated on approximately 16 hectares (39 acres) in Prospect, a suburb of Launceston, Tasmania.

Format The main body of the show took place on Mondays and Wednesdays, and was an elimination contest between several youngsters over several different video games, where winners would go on to Friday's edition. Every Friday, a single winner from the previous day staked points on various matches at differing games, and would go up against various cartoonish characters known as \\"Videators\\". Winners received a Games World bomber jacket, whilst the overall series winner would receive an arcade machine. Bob Mills was the presenter for the show's original run, along with \\"GamesAnimal\\" Dave Perry, Jeremy Daldry and Tim Boone. The original show also had different formats during the week, called The Peep Parlour, which was a computer-designed peep-parlour where videogamers would ask for advice from \\"The Games Mistress\\" related to their video game playing queries, and featured Diane Youdale, better known as Jet from Gladiators, and a selection of other characters. This feature also had \\"master classes\\" presented by the various Videators in which they would guide viewers through particular parts of a selected video game. The show became the highest rated British produced TV show on Sky One - beaten only by The Simpsons and WWF Wrestling. The Peep Parlour was dropped for the second series and replaced by Barry's Joypad starring the Videator Big Boy Barry. It featured video game reviews, cheats, features, as well as being a comedy show for the Big Boy Barry character. This segment of the show had David Walliams in his first appearance on TV playing the part of Lesley Luncheonmeat, Barry's sidekick. There was also an interactive phone-in show where callers would play video games live on the air, against other members of the public, with a celebrity guest at the controls while the viewer gave directions. The games were specially designed for the series, but from the midpoint of series two technological advances were brought in that allowed players to press the buttons on a touch tone phone to control the games, and were from this point games that could be found on the high street. The theme was then slightly changed so there were two teams involved in this format of the show, with players on telephones and players on telephones in their home shown live on TV cameras. The contestants playing on the phone but not seen on the show would normally win. The contestants shown live on the show would be picked at random on the street and a filming recorded earlier in the day of the production crew selecting them down would be shown. By the third series this format had the added twist of forfeits if the challenger in the home would lose a game. One forfeit involved a boy having to rip a poster of Pamela Anderson off his bedroom wall, after losing on Super Street Fighter II. Barry's Joypad was renamed Barry TV or BTV for the third series. An unaired episode from 1994 was leaked onto YouTube. Sky refused to air the show as it contained a feature on GamesWorld magazine, which was published by a rival company (Paragon Publishing) to Sky's News group. A fourth series was scheduled to air in 1995/1996 but never materialized. Hewland decided to cease any plans for series four until 1998, when the show ultimately returned under Hewland's penative new title of New Games World. Bob Mills was replaced by Andy Collins and the set became an Aztec-themed jungle environment. Dave Perry remained as the last of the original on-screen team though he left towards the end of the series, reportedly disillusioned with the new format and setting. Relatedly, the games strand on the now defunct \\"The Computer Channel\\"- another Hewland production- was called \\"Games World\\" until the channel became \\".tv\\", which would generally take the format of a review show, hosted by Big Boy Barry. Pointless star Richard Osman was a researcher on the show https://tellyaddict.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/its-the-point/ The Videators The Videators were the most prominent characters of the series. Series 1 saw the emergence of Big Boy Barry, who became the series' most popular character. Other characters over the first year included Master Moriarty - a stuck-up schoolboy, The Games Messiah, Letty Edwards, Radion Automatic, the Ninja and The Executioner; the latter four were all dropped for Series Two. Barry won the majority of his games (primarily Sonic 2) as did Moriarty. Series 2 saw the return of Barry, along with Master Moriarty and the Games Messiah (now played by a different actor). The most notable new Videators were Mr Mathers, who after a shaky start found his feet and went on a winning streak, and Persian Prince of Perfection, who was inundated with fan mail. Videators such as Combat Cal, the Violet Blade and others tended to lose most of their games and all but one were dropped by the next series. Series 3 saw the return of Barry, Moriarty, the now-established Mathers and the Violet Blade. New Videators were Trixie Belle, Colin the Console Cowboy, Ragga D, and Electric Eddie. A recurring theme in this series saw Colin the Console Cowboy and the Violet Blade feuding with each other. Series 4 saw pretty much an entirely new cast of videators, with only Martin Mathers returning as a new character, Lord Leslie Mathers.

Manegold, the youngest son of Count Diepold of Berg in Upper Swabia and of Gisela of Andechs, was destined for a religious career. His older brother Otto also became a bishop. He became a monk in his youth, then abbot of the monastery of St. George's Abbey in the Black Forest, where he defended its property rights against counter-claims from Tennenbach Abbey (1180-1187). At the same time he was also put in charge of Kremsm√ºnster Abbey in Austria, a role he held onto from 1183 to 1206, although not without opposition. He then became abbot of the Bavarian monastery of Tegernsee between 1190 and 1206, and gave up the abbacy of St. George's in 1193 or 1194. In 1197 he took part in the Crusade to the Holy Land. He was elected Bishop of Passau in 1206, which he remained until 1215. Against the background of the pro-Hohenstaufen attitude of the Counts of Berg, Manegold was much involved in the political activities of the Holy Roman Empire and met with Emperor Henry VI (1190-1197), King Philip (1198-1208), Emperor Otto IV (1198-1215/1218) and Emperor Frederick II (1212/1215-1250). As a bishop he was interested in the territorial expansion of his bishopric, and had the city of Passau fortified in 1209. He died on 9 June 1215 in Vienna. References * * Buhlmann, M., 2003.

Other publishers, notably Saalfield, adopted this format after Whitman achieved success with its early titles, priced initially at 10¬¢ each (later 15¬¢). Format A Big Little Book was typically 3‚Öù‚Ä≥ wide and 4¬Ω‚Ä≥ high, with 212 to 432 pages making an approximate thickness of 1¬Ω‚Ä≥. The interior book design usually displayed full-page black-and-white illustrations on the right side, facing the pages of text on the left. Stories were often related to radio programs (The Shadow), comic strips (The Gumps), children's books (Uncle Wiggily), novels (John Carter of Mars) and movies (Bambi). Later books of the series had interior color illustrations. History After the first Big Little Book, The Adventures of Dick Tracy, was published (December 1932), numerous titles were sold through Woolworth's and other retail store systems during the 1930s. With a name change to Better Little Books during 1938, the series continued into the 1960s. Variations such as Dime Action Books were produced by other publishers, as noted by the Collecting Channel's Andy Hooper: While the format was pioneered by Whitman Publishing, other firms including Van Wiseman, Saalfield, Goldsmith, Lynn and World Syndicate Publishing all produced big little books between 1934 and 1960. Whitman was also the last to abandon the form, publishing big little books about boomer characters like Major Matt Mason into the mid-1960s. Not all big little books adhered to the original format of text on the left side and a large graphic on the right of each page spread, and the earlier, more heavily illustrated books are more valuable as a result... Dick Tracy was the hero of the first big little book, and he was followed by almost every major cartoon, comic and radio character of the 1930s, including Alley Oop, Buck Rogers, Blondie and Dagwood, Li'l Abner, Mickey Mouse, Popeye, Captain Midnight, Tarzan and dozens more. There were also numerous books published that featured original characters created particularly for the Big Little series, and those are now little remembered, usually selling for $10 or less each in any condition. A few titles were ostensibly non-fiction works about famous people, as with Whitman‚Äôs Billy The Kid (1935) and The Story of Jackie Cooper (1933), which proves that biographies of child movie stars are no recent phenomenon.Hooper, Andy. Collecting Channel, 2000. Recently, Robert Thibadeau's Antique Book project at Carnegie Mellon has made at least two Big Little Books available online. Thibadeau attempts to \\"capture the entire production\\" of an old book with facsimile images showing pages with wear and tear. \\"We're basically trying to eternalize that book as it is,\\" says Thibadeau. The Antique Books Digital Library offers two free Big Little Book titles, Tim McCoy on the Tomahawk Trail and Bronc Peeler The Lone Cowboy. Fred Harman's Bronc Peeler was a Western comic strip character who was a precursor to another comic strip drawn by Harman, the more successful Red Ryder. Sam Mendes' film Road to Perdition (2002) showed a boy reading The Lone Ranger Big Little Book, but this was an anachronism since the movie is set during 1931, a year prior to the first Big Little Books and two years before The Lone Ranger premiered January 31, 1933 on radio.

Life  Born in Vienna on 17 June 1856 as the son of Nikolaus Dumba (1830-1900), a wealthy Austrian- Greek entrepreneur. The Dumbas, originally from the village Vlasti, in the Ottoman province of Rumelia, had emigrated and settled in Vienna in 1817.William D. Godsey, Aristocratic Redoubt: The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office on the Eve of the First World War, West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1999, p. 86. After completing his legal studies and obtaining a doctorate in law, he joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service in 1879. He subsequently served at the Austro-Hungarian Embassy at London from 1881 to 1886 and then at St. Petersburg, Rome, Bucharest and Paris. From 1903 to 1905, Dr. Dumba served as Minister at Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbia. Then followed four years of service in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Vienna, whereupon he was appointed Minister at Stockholm in 1909 where he stayed until 1912.√ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950, vol. I, p. 203 He was known for being Austria-Hungary's only bourgeois ambassador at the time although he was from a very wealthy family.Godsey, op. cit., 1999, p. 30. On 4 March 1913, Dr. Dumba was appointed as the successor of Baron Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r, the long time ambassador to Washington D.C. and dean of the diplomatic corps. He presented his letter of credentials to President Wilson on 24 April 1913.'Praises Wilson's politics', New York Times, 25 April 1913. Although the first months in office were calm, the outbreak of World War I would quickly put him in the spotlight. A first controversy concerned the Austro-Hungarian government's offer of 'rehabilitation' to those of its citizens living abroad and who had fled to escape compulsory military service provided they returned home and served in the army. This scheme ran counter to the U.S. official policy of neutrality forbidding its citizens from actively taking sides in the war. However, a much more serious incident erupted in early September 1915 when media reported that Dr. Dumba had been involved in schemes to sabotage the U.S. munitions industry. On 5 September, the news broke that he had admitted to giving James Francis Jewell Archibald, an American news correspondent, a letter for delivery to Foreign Minister Baron Buri√°n von Rajecz in Vienna. In the letter, he proposed certain measures to hamper the manufacture of munitions for the Allies in the US.See for example 'Dumba admits plot to cripple munition plants', 'Ambassador Dumba's plan', 'Action on Dumba's offense in doubt', 'Awaiting Dumba letter', New York Times, 6 September 1915. The so-called 'Dumba Affair' quickly became a scandal. On 9 September 1915, Secretary of State Lansing declared him no longer acceptable and requested the Austro-Hungarian government to recall its ambassador. In the note, Lansing charged the ambassador with espionage for having advocated that his government back 'plans to instigate strikes in American manufacturing plants engaged in the production of munitions of war'.'American Note to Austria-Hungary Requesting Recall of Ambassador Dumba', op. cit., 10 September 1915) On 27 September, the Austro-Hungarian government eventually agreed to recall Dr. Dumba.'Austria agrees to recall Dumba, op. cit., 28 September 1915 He left the United States on 5 October and was allowed to pass unhindered through the Entente blockade of the European continent and return to Vienna.'Dumba sails, op. cit., 6 October 1915. Following his departure, the Austro-Hungarian embassy was led by a charg√© d'affaires (Erich Freiherr Zwiedinek von S√ºdenhorst). Count Tarnowski von Tarn√≥w was named as his successor in November 1916 but never presented his credentials to President Wilson, thus making Dr. Dumba the last official ambassador of Austria-Hungary to the United States. Upon his return to Vienna, Dr. Dumba retired from the diplomatic service.'Dr. Dumba is retired, op. cit., 5 November 1915. In May 1917, he was ennobled and appointed to the Upper House (Herrenhaus), but he would play no further prominent role in public life.'Emperor honors Dumba', op. cit., 24 May 1917 In his later years, he became a pacifist and wrote several books, including his memoirs which were published in 1932 and in which he defended his action during World War I. Although much publicised at the time, Dr. Dumba was not the first foreign diplomat to be declared persona non grata by the U.S. government. In 1888, the British envoy Lord Sackville-West had been sacked following the publication of the so-called Murchison letter during the presidential campaign. It could also be noted that the Dumba Affair also included the military attach√© at the German Embassy, Captain Franz von Papen, who was declared persona non grata in December 1915 and who would later play a prominent role in German politics in the 1930s. Count von Dumba died in Bodensdorf am Ossiacher See on 6 January 1947.

Background RJR MacDonald Inc. and Imperial Tobacco challenged the Act as being ultra vires the federal government's criminal law power and peace, order and good government power, and as being in violation of the right to freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Reasons of the court The Court upheld the Act as valid under the criminal law power but found that sections 4, 8, and 9 of the Act violated freedom of expression and could not be saved under section 1 of the Charter. There were four separate opinions given. =Division of powers= The Court found the Act was not colourable. The evil that the law is addressing does not have to be approached directly, and in these circumstances it would not be practical. Even though the subject was not one that was commonly recognized as being criminal does not necessarily invalidate it. =Charter issues= The majority held that the impugned sections violated the freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Charter. The right to freedom of expression includes the right to say nothing. The mandatory use of unattributed labels was a form of forced expression and so invoked section 2(b). The majority held that the violation was not upheld under section 1 of the Charter.

Lelio Orsi (1508/1511 ‚Äì 1587), also known as Lelio da Novellara, was a Mannerist painter and architect of the Reggio Emilia school in northern Italy. He was born and died in Novellara, and much of his work was completed in Reggio. He appears to have studied under such as Giovanni Giarola, a pupil of Antonio da Correggio. There is documentary evidence that he visited Rome in 1554‚Äì55, and may have been influenced by Girolamo Bedoli, Correggio and the prototypic mannerists Giulio Romano as well as Michelangelo and his successor Daniele da Volterra. He is said to have trained Raffaellino da Reggio. Other pupils or followers were Giovanni Bianchi, known as il Bertone Reggiano. and Jacopo Borbone of Novellara.G. Tiraboschi, page 126. He was active in both exterior and interior decoration, and much of his work is in small cabinet pieces, not large altarpieces. Much of his output ended in the collections of the Dukes of Este in Ferrara. Orsi appears to be \\"reading\\" Correggio with the lens of Mannerism: the nocturnal, limned ethereal simplicity of Correggio here is constrained into contorted poses, perspective distorted, and settings crowded. The effect at times is unsettling. While the angels above unsheathing divine swords are meant to carry the day in The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine it appears that the execution was stymied by breakdown within the complex set of depicted gears.

Her support for the Relationships Bill 2005, a bill which extends legal protections to same-sex couples, has made her a target of fundamentalist groups. Her opinions are considered by some as being incompatible with the opinions of her 'bible belt' electorate. Despite this, she was returned with a large majority at the landslide 2006 state election with a technically safe 62.1 percent two-party vote from an 8.5-point two-party swing, defeating Liberal candidate and Assemblies of God pastor Pat Trainor. She has otherwise won the seat marginally since 1997. At the 2014 state election, Bedford held Florey with a margin of 2.5 percent. Bedford resigned from Labor and became an independent on 28 March 2017 after Labor's Jack Snelling won Florey pre-selection partly as a result of the major electoral redistribution which moved two-thirds of Playford voters in to Florey ahead of the 2018 state election. As with the rest of the crossbench, Bedford continued to provide confidence and supply support to the minority Labor government. A ReachTEL poll conducted on 2 March 2017 of 606 voters in post-redistribution Florey indicated a 33.4 percent primary vote for Bedford running as an independent which would likely see the endorsed Labor candidate defeated after preferences.Labor polling shows boundary redraw appeal loss means Jack Snelling could lose to veteran party MP Frances Bedford: The Advertiser 10 March 2017 In December 2017, Snelling decided not to nominate for Florey, and was replaced as Labor's endorsed candidate by Rik Morris. Bedford successfully re-contested Florey as an independent at the 2018 state election, gaining a 30.6 percent first preference vote and defeating Morris on preferences.Frances Bedford to contest 2018 South Australian election as an independent: ABC 1 December 2017 References External links *Parliamentary Profile: SA Parliament website *Official website of Frances Bedford MP JP Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of South Australia Category:Independent members of the Parliament of South Australia Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians Category:Women members of the South Australian House of Assembly ","title":"Frances Bedford"},{"id":"3671434","text":"Sunset Drive, also known as Southwest 72nd Street is a east‚Äìwest arterial road traversing the southwestern suburbs of Miami, Florida, from the northwestern portions of the Kendall area to Coral Gables. A central portion of Sunset Drive is maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation as State Road 986 (SR 986), which runs from the Homestead Extension (HEFT) underpass to Southwest 69th Avenue and is signed through South Miami to US 1. Route description =Western section= State Road 986 westbound west of SR 826 Southwest 72nd Street begins as a private dirt road accessing farmland in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, north of The Hammocks and west of Kendall West. The road heads east and, upon reaching 167th Avenue, it becomes a paved four-laned divided road. Sunset Drive then continues east past residential neighborhoods for , reaching a collection of neighborhood shopping centers and the western edge of the Kendall West community at Southwest 157th Avenue. From here to its eastern terminus, Southwest 72nd Street is given the designation of Marjory Stoneman Douglas Sunset Drive. After another mile (1.6 km), and after passing by more residential neighborhoods, Sunset Drive crosses Southwest 147th Avenue and enters the unincorporated Kendale Lakes. The road passes one block to the south of the Miccosukee Golf & Country Club, and continues east between the backs of residential neighborhoods for another , older than those lying to the west, with the only break being Miami Sunset Senior High. After crossing Southwest 127th Avenue, Sunset Drive's character changes as it passes by churches, schools, large-lot houses and market gardens until it reaches the HEFT. =State Road 986 section= The locations of both termini of State Road 986 are unclear, with some commercial mapping and even Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) material showing the western terminus of SR 986 at Southwest 127th Avenue and the eastern terminus at either the South Dixie Highway (US 1) or Red Road. According to the FDOT road inventory, the western terminus of SR 986 lies where Sunset Drive passes under the HEFT without an interchange, with the section of road west to Southwest 127th Avenue acknowledged as lying off the Florida State Highway System. East of the HEFT underpass, SR 986 leaves Kendale Lakes and enters the Kendall district proper, cutting across its northwestern corner. Sunset Drive first passes a small shopping district and then goes between two residential neighborhoods. As SR 986 approaches Southwest 107th Avenue (SR 985), east of the HEFT, the road enters another shopping district. Once past SR 985, Sunset Drive almost-immediately crosses the Snapper Creek Canal and enters the eponymous community of Sunset. SR 986 then passes a mixture of houses, strip malls, commercial services and churches for the next , whereupon it crosses a CSX railroad and passes under the Don Shula Expressway (SR 874) without an interchange. After another of strip malls, SR 986 crosses Galloway Road (SR 973) and enters the community of Glenvar Heights. East of Galloway Road, SR 986 gains a leafy residential character, reaching the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) interchange after . SR 986 carries on east through more leafy neighborhoods for another . Here, the SR 986 designation stops at Southwest 69th Avenue, the boundary between Glenvar Heights and the incorporated city of South Miami. Like at its western terminus, the FDOT inventory recognises Sunset Drive as far east as Red Road (approximately ) as lying off the State Highway System. =Eastern section= Sunset Drive continues east from SR 986's eastern terminus through leafy neighborhoods of western South Miami. The road's character changes once it passes Southwest 63rd Avenue, as Sunset Drive begins to enter South Miami's central business district, passing by low-rise apartment buildings, multi-storeyed office complexes, and the South Miami Hospital. At Southwest 62nd Avenue, eastbound motorists on Sunset Drive wishing to head north along US 1 are encouraged by signage to detour along it, while Sunset Drive continues east for through the civic heart of South Miami, including a section of road paved with red brick near the city hall. The road then passes under the elevated Metrorail tracks, just to the south of South Miami Metrorail station, and immediately meets the South Dixie Highway (US 1) at an oblique intersection. East of US 1, Sunset Drive scales down to become an undivided two-laned shopping street for the next two blocks, reaching Red Road (Southwest 57th Avenue) after . On the other side, Sunset Drive leaves South Miami and forms the boundary between Coral Gables, to the north, and an unincorporated section of Miami-Dade County to the south. After passing between shops on the northern side of the road and houses on the southern side, Sunset Drive enters an opulent, leafy residential neighborhood, eventually losing its kerbing, and crossing entirely into Coral Gables about later. After about , Sunset Drive terminates at Cartagena Plaza, a traffic circle that also features LeJeune Road's southern terminus and Old Cutler Road's northeastern terminus. History In 1996, the Florida State Legislature passed a resolution renaming SR 986 as Marjory Stoneman Douglas Sunset Drive. Until 1997, its eastern terminus was three blocks further to the east of US 1 at Red Road, to intersect with a since-truncated SR 959 on the South Miami-Coral Gables boundary.

Route description Bird Road at US 1 Florida State Road 976 sign on Bird Road in Miami. State Road 976 begins on Bird Road at the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike in Westwood Lakes, heading east as a primarily commercial six lane divided highway, including many strip malls on its route. It crosses State Road 985 before leaving Westwood Lakes and entering Westchester. Between SW 94th Avenue and SW 92nd Avenue, Bird Road passes by Bird Bowl, one of the few remaining bowling establishments in Miami- Dade County. Bird Road then crosses State Road 973 (Galloway Road), and borders the northern end of Tropical Park, the former site of a race track that had its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, and now a Miami-Dade County park. At the northeastern border of Tropical Park, SR 976 has an interchange with the Palmetto Expressway. At the southeast corner of its intersection of Ludlam Road, a block of vintage stores lines the road. At State Road 959, the road enters Coral Gables, with the median of the road containing spreading banyan trees, similar to the nearby Coral Way. Between State Road 959 (Red Road) and State Road 953 (LeJeune Road), the road is primarily residential, crossing a couple of golf courses. East of SR 953 and Coral Gables High School, it resumes commercial businesses, and has intersections with Ponce De Leon Boulevard, where the median disappears, and quickly heads towards its eastern terminus of US 1.

History  The band was formed in the late 1980s by Axel Machens (vocals, synth, harmonizer, drum computer), Christoph Kunze (vocals, synth, sampler, percussions) and Achim Windel (vocals, sampler, sequencer, synth). Axel met Christoph in a club in 1989 where Christoph was an EBM DJ. The pair soon discovered that they each owned a synthesizer which led them to begin experimenting with making music together. Achim soon joined Christoph and Axel and the trio began making recordings on four track tapes. After self-producing several cassette tapes, the band recorded their first full-length album, Galleries of Pain, in 1992. The album was recorded and mixed with the assistance of Bruno Kramm of Das Ich at his Danse Macabre Studio, then released on Kramm's Danse Macabre label. The band informally credited Bruno as the fourth \\"secret\\" band member in the studio not only due to his production assistance, but owing to the availability of his studio's electronic music equipment which greatly expanded on what the band had available at the time. Galleries of Pain is considered by many to be a classic EBM album. Two releases followed Galleries - the Slashed Open EP in 1993 and Manipulated Mind Control in 1994. The creation of Manipulated Mind Control became a turning point for the band due to difficulties during production. External pressures to produce dancefloor oriented tracks in opposition to the band's characteristic atmospherics and internal conflicts left the band not on talking terms post-production. Frustrated and not having the energy to work on new material, the band released a compendium of earlier and rare material in order to finish out their contract with Ausfahrt records. Other than a pair of live shows in 1999 and 2004, the band was effectively defunct until 2014. In 2011, as part of the Infacted Recordings classics collection, Gargoyles & Galleries was re-mastered and released worldwide limited to 1000 copies. Tracks 1-14 were originally released as the 1992 debut album Galleries of Pain. Tracks 15 to 18 were originally released as the 1990 demo tape Gargoyles.

Placebo Effect played live at the Wave Gothik Treffen Leipzig in June 2014 ‚Äì their first live WGT concert since 2004. The setlist included 2 new songs \\"Nothing to Cry\\" and \\"Slave.\\" The same year, the band re- released Slashed Open as a Limited Deluxe Edition on Purple Vinyl, hand numbered (500 copies) in Gatefold-Cover, including two bonus tracks and one remix. In 2016, founding member Achim Windel passed away unexpectedly. Achim's death brought Axel and Christoph back into contact and began talk of new collaboration. In 2017 the remaining two members of the group announced work on a new album, Shattered Souls. The group went on to play live shows in 2018 at the Dark EBM Souls international industrial festival in Bratislava, Slovakia, at Das Bett in Frankfurt, Germany, and the Fortyfication-Festival in Berlin. Live shows continued into 2019 at Nocturnal Culture Night in Deutzen, Germany and Sala 0 in Madrid, Spain.  Side projects  In 1995, Placebo Effect parted ways, but Axel Machens collaborated with Ecki Stieg to form the side project \\"Accessories\\" and cut an album entitled Vendetta. In 1999, Machens performed his solo-project called \\"Breathe\\" and cut The Laughing Dolls EP and several single mixes.

Route description Coral Way with St Sophia Orthodox Church near 24th Road and 3rd Avenue Coral Way begins as SW 26th Street at Southwest 157th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade County as a mix of a residential street and commercial street. Just west of the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike, Coral Way curves slightly to the north, becoming SW 24th Street as it passes over the Turnpike without an interchange. It continues through unincorporated Miami-Dade County, intersecting with Galloway Road, interchanging with the Palmetto Expressway, and Ludlam Road, becoming mostly residential east of Ludlam Road. At Red Road (Southwest 57th Avenue), Coral Way enters Coral Gables, becomes a two lane street, and begins a residential stretch of road in which Coral Way is covered under a natural canopy from each side of the road made of large oak, mahogany and other hardwood trees. At South Greenway Drive/Anderson Road, it exits the canopy, with the trees still lining the street, and it borders the Granada Golf Course for two blocks before a traffic circle turns Coral Way into a one way westbound street for two blocks further, with eastbound traffic taking Segovia Street south to Biltmore Way to rejoin Coral Way at the intersection with Le Jeune Road (SW 42nd Avenue). For the next half mile, Coral Way is also known as the Miracle Mile, the major east-west road through downtown Coral Gables. The median resumes with large date palm trees and flower beds lining the center of the road. The Miracle Mile ends at Douglas Road, with Coral Way leaving Coral Gables and entering Miami, and is also the western terminus of State Road 972. State Road 972 begins on the intersection between Coral Way/Southwest 22nd Street and Douglas Road (Southwest 37th Avenue) at the Coral Gables and Miami boundary, with SR 972 heading east into Miami. It runs as a 4-lane divided road with many old ficus and banyan trees in its median through a commercial area, passing by the Miracle Marketplace a few blocks east of the western terminus. It then intersects SW 27th Avenue (SR 9), and continues straight east until an intersection with SW 3rd Avenue in the Five Points neighborhood, where Coral Way veers northeast, becoming SW 3rd Avenue, and intersects with SW 12th Avenue (SR 933), still as a commercial road. After crossing under I-95 and intersecting with SW 15th Road/Broadway just east of I-95, the historic scenic drive of Coral Way ends, as it curves back into a purely eastern direction and becomes an undivided four lane road known also as SW 13th Street, heading into the core of central Miami. Four blocks east of SW 15th Road and one block east of Miami Avenue, where the road is known as SE 13th Street, SR 972 meet its eastern terminus of U.S. Route 1 (Brickell Avenue) in the downtown Miami Financial District. History The Coral Way Corridor was built in 1922, connecting the city of Miami to Coral Gables with citrus lined streets. A few years later streetcar tracks were laid down the middle. In 1929, a roadside beautification program was started and 1,200 non- native banyan trees were planted along it. In the years after the merger of Silver Bluff and Miami, Coral Way has been extended many times. Westward from SR 972, it now travels along Southwest 24th Street (Miracle Mile in eastern Coral Gables) until after passing over Florida's Turnpike, rounding a gentle chicane, and following Southwest 26th Street until its current terminus just west of Southwest 162nd Avenue. Although the newer sections of Coral Way west of Coral Gables do not have the scenery or the history of the current SR 972, they form an extremely important commercial link for Miami-Dade County. =SR 972= Florida State Road 972 sign on Coral Way. Coral Way was designated as State Road 956 in 1980 and renumbered as State Road 972 in 1983. Originally, SR 972 extended further west along Southwest 24th Street to Southwest 107th Avenue (SR 985), near Tamiami Park and Florida International University. A series of truncations started in the late 1990s, first moving the western terminus eastward to SR 973 (Galloway Road/Southwest 87th Avenue), then another to SR 953 (LeJeune Road) in Coral Gables ‚Äì the exit signs on the Palmetto Expressway were replaced with ones without the State Road designation in 2001 ‚Äì and, at the request of businesses along the Miracle Mile stretch of Coral Way, a final move of the western terminus one-half mile to its current location. Ironically, the final move re-established SR 972 on the original, pre-1926 configuration of Coral Way (many commercially prepared maps still show an intersection with LeJeune Road as the western terminus).

Flagler Street is the latitudinal baseline that divides all the streets on the Miami-Dade County grid plan as north or south streets (the east-west division is along Miami Avenue). Flagler Street is named after industrialist Henry Flagler and serves as a major commercial east-west highway through central Miami-Dade County, with a mixture of residential neighborhoods (featuring apartment complexes) and strip malls, the commercial presence increasing as SR 968 approaches downtown Miami. Between SR 973 (Galloway Road/West 87th Avenue) and West 2nd Avenue, Flagler Street is signed State Road 968 (SR 968). Route description Flagler Street as it runs through the oldest part of Downtown Miami State Road 968 begins at Galloway Road in Fontainebleau, as it takes the six lane Flagler Street east through a mostly commercial area with residential housing dotting the street as it quickly approaches the Mall of the Americas (formerly Midway Mall) to the north and the interchange with the Palmetto Expressway at the eastern end of the mall. Seven blocks east of the interchange, the road enters the city of Miami proper after crossing the Tamiami Canal one block west of the intersection with Milam Dairy Road and becomes a four lane road from here until reaching I-95. At NW 67th Court, the divided highway comes together as a four lane road continuing east, with business lining both sides of the street. Following Red Road (West 57th Avenue), it reaches Flagler Memorial Park to the north, as the road continues east through more businesses and apartment complexes. The road then intersects with LeJeune Road (West 42nd Avenue), which provides access to Miami International Airport, with SR 968 continuing east towards central Miami.

The road then intersects West 17th Avenue just a few blocks south of Marlins Park, as SR 968 enters Central Miami. From 12th Avenue West to the Miami River, Flagler Street features one eastbound lane with three westbound lanes, with the intersection with US 441/SR 7 (West 7th Street) just four blocks west of the Miami River drawbridges. Immediately after, it reaches I-95, with access via nearby streets. The rest of the road features government and business skyscrapers and metro rapid transit trackage towering over the road. At SW 2nd Avenue, SR 968 meets its eastern terminus, and Flagler Street (former SR 968) is once again a two-way street, with one lane in each direction. At Miami Avenue, Flagler Street forms the center of Miami, as Miami Avenue represents the baseline for east and west. The road becomes East Flagler Street as it continues through central Miami, terminating at Biscayne Boulevard (U.S. Route 1), with Bayfront Park, featuring a scenic view of Biscayne Bay just east of the end of Flagler Street. Beyond SR 968's western terminus, West Flagler Street extends west to State Road 985 to end at an intersection with West 118th Avenue in Tamiami, just west of the Homestead Extension. History View westward of the intersection of Flagler Street and Biscayne Boulevard (US 1), 1958 Formerly State Road 954, Flagler Street received its current Florida Department of Transportation designation in 1983, when FDOT reassigned route numbers to various streets in southeastern Florida and removed the SR 968 designation from North Miami Boulevard (now State Road 922). SR 968's original western terminus was at an intersection with SR 985 (Avenue of the Americas/West 107th Avenue). In 1987, FDOT truncated the westernmost two miles of the route to its current configuration. SR 968's original eastern terminus was at Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) in Miami, until FDOT turned over the section between US 1 and SW 2nd Avenue to the city of Miami. As a condition for the relinquishment of Brickell Avenue (US 1) to the city of Miami, FDOT plans to adopt both SE 1st Street and NE 1st Street in downtown Miami as part of SR 968 and re-connect the route to Biscayne Boulevard.City of Miami Legislation Resolution.

Selected in the 1990 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers, he later played for the Washington Redskins, Seattle Seahawks, and New England Patriots. Early life Born in Missoula, Montana, Friesz moved with his family in 1975 to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; he attended Coeur d'Alene High School and graduated in 1985. Friesz spent two seasons as a back-up; as a sophomore, he was third-string behind senior Steve Halliday and junior Scott Wellman as the Vikings won their first state title in 1982. The next year, CDA was state runner-up behind the starter in his senior season in 1984. His first game was against perennial state power Borah in Boise, who had beaten the Vikings at Coeur d'Alene in 1983. The #2-ranked CDA Vikings returned the favor and beat the Lions 19‚Äì14 on the then-green AstroTurf of Bronco Stadium. Friesz completed 21 of 40 passes for 260 yards and two touchdowns in his starting debut. The Vikings took over the top spot in the state poll and beat Rogers of Spokane 46‚Äì0 the following week. They won their first ten games, but lost in the state semifinals 25‚Äì20 to Capital, who also had handed them their last loss, at the finals in 1983. The game was played at a neutral site, the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Friesz's future home field. He finished the season with over 1,900 yards passing and 19 touchdowns in eleven games, and was second team (CDA won the state title the following year with Duane Halliday at quarterback.) Friesz enrolled at the University of Idaho, recruited by head coach Dennis Erickson, after attending the coach's Vandal football camp in the summer of 1984. Lightly recruited, his only other offer was from New Mexico, at the time a struggling program in the Western Athletic Conference. Friesz had been turned down by Big Sky member Weber State, then coached by Mike Price. College career Friesz redshirted in 1985 as the Vandals won their first outright Big Sky Conference title since 1971. In 1986, under new head coach Keith Gilbertson, he served as the backup to Scott Linehan, who would go on to become head coach of the St. Louis Rams. Friesz was the Vandals starting quarterback for three years, beginning in 1987, when he threw 28 touchdown passes as a sophomore and was named player of the year in the Big Sky and second team All-American (Division I-AA). In his junior season of 1988, he guided the Vandals to a 9‚Äì1 regular season and two playoff wins, ending the season with a road loss in the Division I-AA semi-finals. He was a consensus All-American selection In his senior season in 1989, Freisz threw 31 touchdowns and for over 4,000 yards in guiding the Vandals to their third consecutive conference championship. Idaho went undefeated in conference play (8‚Äì0), the only time in school history. Friesz averaged over 360 yards per game and passed for over 300 yards in ten consecutive games. He received the Walter Payton Award as the outstanding player in the nation in Division I-AA. In his college career, #17 passed for over 10,000 yards and was the conference player-of-the-year for three consecutive years. The Vandals' annual MVP award has been renamed the John Friesz Award in his honor. In August 2006, Friesz was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Indiana. His #17 was officially retired by the University of Idaho in October 2006. The same number was retired by his high school in 1991. Professional career In the 1990 NFL Draft, Friesz was the tenth quarterback selected, taken in the sixth round (138th overall) by the San Diego Chargers. Other quarterbacks in this draft were Jeff George (#1 overall pick), Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware, future Super Bowl starter Neil O'Donnell, and Scott Mitchell. Friesz became the starting quarterback for the Chargers in 1991, his second season. He suffered a season-ending knee injury in a pre-season game in 1992. The Chargers then acquired QB Stan Humphries from the Washington Redskins, who was drafted by then Redskins GM Bobby Beathard, who was the Chargers GM at that time. Humphries became the starting QB and led the Chargers, who were winless in their first four games, to an 11‚Äì5 record, ending a ten-year playoff drought and winning their first AFC West Division title since 1981 under rookie coach Bobby Ross. Friesz returned to the Chargers the next season as the backup quarterback and left the Chargers as a free agent prior to the 1994 season. Friesz passed for over 8,600 yards and 45 touchdowns in his professional career.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/FrieJo00.htm References External links * * Idaho Vandal Athletics Hall of Fame profile * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:New England Patriots players Category:Idaho Vandals football players Category:Walter Payton Award winners Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Category:Players of American football from Montana Category:Sportspeople from Missoula, Montana Category:Players of American football from Idaho ","title":"John Friesz"},{"id":"3671471","text":"is a Japanese restaurant and cafe chain headquartered in Shinagawa, Tokyo.

Family Wen Jiao's father Wen Dan (Ê∫´Êæπ) was a commandery governor, and his uncle Wen Xian (Ê∫´Áæ®) was an early Jin prime minister. His maternal aunt was the wife of the general Liu Kun (ÂäâÁê®), who for years tried in vain to stop Han Zhao forces from seizing Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern central and northern Shanxi) from Jin. Biography =Duan Pidi affiliation= In 317, after Emperor Min had been captured by Han Zhao, Liu Kun, who had then lost Bing Province and was at the headquarters of Duan Pidi (ÊÆµÂåπÁ£æ), the governor of You Province (ÂπΩÂ∑û, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), commissioned Wen Jiao to head to Jiankang to offer Sima Rui the Prince of Langye a petition to assume imperial title. Although his mother Lady Cui tried to stop him from leaving, he went anyway. Once Wen arrived in Jiankang, many of the Jin officials in the provisional capital, including Wang Dao, Zhou Yi (Âë®È°ó), and Yu Liang were impressed by his talents and sought to befriend him. He sought to return north, but Sima Rui ordered him to stay. When Liu Kun was killed by Duan in 318 (after Duan became concerned that Liu, whose son Liu Qun (ÂäâÁæ£) had been captured by his rival for the Duan tribal leadership, Duan Mopei (ÊÆµÊú´Êü∏), might betray him to rescue Liu Qun), Wen, having heard that his mother Lady Cui had also died in the interim, again sought to return north, but Sima Rui, who had by now taken the imperial title (as Emperor Yuan), ordered him to stay and further ordered him to serve in his administration. He became a friend and a trusted advisor of the crown prince, Emperor Yuan's son Sima Shao. When the warlord Wang Dun resisted Emperor Yuan and captured the capital Jiankang in 322, it was Wen who stopped Crown Prince Shao from taking the risky maneuver of engaging in a final confrontation with Wang. As the years went by, Wen became known for being a good judge of talent. =Consort to Emperor Ming= After Emperor Yuan died in 323, Crown Prince Shao took the throne as Emperor Ming. He continued to consult Wen on many important matters, and Wang Dun sought to stop that by forcing Wen to become an assistant of his. Once Wen arrived at Wang's camp, he pretended to submit to Wang, flattering him and giving him many practical suggestions. Wang came to believe he had won Wen over and, in 324, as he grew ill and pondered his next move, he sent Wen back to Jiankang as its mayor, so that Wen could watch the emperor's move. Instead, Wen revealed Wang's illness and plans to Emperor Ming, which helped lead to Wang's forces' defeat when they attacked the capital later that year. =Yu Liang= After Emperor Ming died in 325, his will left a number of high level officials in charge of his four-year-old son Emperor Cheng's administration. However, Yu Liang, as the brother of Empress Dowager Yu, was the actual regent. His youthful arrogance quickly offended the generals Su Jun, Zu Yue (Á•ñÁ¥Ñ), and Tao Kan, and he therefore in 326 made Wen the governor of the key Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi), to defend against possible military rebellions. Later, when Su became sufficiently angered by Yu that he rebelled in 327, Wen wanted to immediately come to Yu's aid, but Yu, overly confident that he could defeat Su and further concerned about Tao (whose Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei) was to Wen's west), declined. However, in early 328, it became clear that the imperial forces in the capital were in trouble, as Su defeated every single force that stood in his way. Wen quickly headed toward Jiankang notwithstanding Yu's reservations, but could not get to Jiankang before the capital fell to Su. Yu was forced to flee, and Emperor Cheng and his mother Empress Dowager Yu were captured. Empress Dowager Yu soon died from distress. Yu joined Wen, and they considered how they could defeat Su. Wen's cousin Wen Chong (Ê∫´ÂÖÖ) suggested that they offer the title of the supreme commander to Tao, and they did so. However, Tao was still resentful of Yu and therefore initially refused. Eventually, however, after his anger was over, he accepted, and he, Wen, and Yu combined their forces and headed east to Jiankang. In winter 328, during a battle with Su, Su was killed, and they subsequently defeated the remnants of Su's army in 329. For his contributions, Wen was created the Duke of Shi'an. =Death= Jiankang having been heavily damaged during the war (and the palace having been burnt during the war), Wen considered moving the capital to Yuzhang (Ë±´Á´†, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but after Wang Dao opposed, noting that Jiankang was in a better position to monitor the northern defenses against Later Zhao, Wen agreed to keep the capital at Jiankang. Most officials requested that he stay in Jiankang to serve as regent, but Wen, believing that Emperor Ming had intended that Wang Dao serve in that role, declined and, after leaving all of his supplies with Wang, set out to return to Jiang Province. On the way, however, he suffered problems with his tooth or teeth, and after having it/them pulled, suffered a stroke and died. He was buried at Yuzhang. The imperial government, because of his great contributions, considered building a magnificent tomb for him north of Emperor Ming's tomb, but Tao noted that Wen himself was thrifty in his own spendings and would not have wanted the government to expend effort for money for such a tomb, and so the proposal was not carried out.

He finished runner-up to Jahangir Khan at both the 1982 World Masters and the 1983 British Open. The match for which Awad is best remembered came at the Chichester Open in 1983 against Jahangir, which set a new world record for the longest squash match on record. The first game itself was a record for the longest single game in a squash match, as Awad recovered from 1-8 down to take the game 10-9 in 1 hour and 11 minutes. In the end, Jahangir won the match 9-10, 9-5, 9-7, 9-2 in 2 hours and 46 minutes. Awad's acrobatic performances on the squash court earned him the nicknames \\"rubber man\\" and \\"grasshopper\\".

In 1521 he married Giovanna, the daughter of Bartolomeo Vacchi, a Venetian painter. Much of his work was commissioned by the duke Ercole I d'Este from Ferrara.

For example, his Massacre canvas has a turbulent and cartoonish crowding. The exact date, or even year, of his death is not known, but he died during a plague which devastated the area.

It forms as white, green to reddish tabular monoclinic tectosilicate crystals with a Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4 and a specific gravity of 2.1 to 2.2. It commonly occurs as a devitrification product of volcanic glass shards in tuff and as vesicle fillings in basalts, andesites and rhyolites. It was described in 1969 from an occurrence in the Barstow Formation, San Bernardino County, California. Sodium levels in clinoptilolite are generally higher than potassium levels, as is the case with the San Bernardino Barstow Formation, but there are sources that are potassium-rich and have minimal sodium. It forms a series with heulandite: *Clinoptilolite-Ca ‚Äì heulandite-Ca solid solution series *Clinoptilolite-K ‚Äì heulandite-K solid solution series *Clinoptilolite-Na ‚Äì heulandite-Na solid solution series Use of clinoptilolite in industry and academia focuses on its ion exchange properties having a strong exchange affinity for ammonium (NH4+). A typical example of this is in its use as an enzyme-based urea sensor. Research is generally focused around the shores of the Aegean Sea due to the abundance of natural clinoptilolite in easily accessible surface deposits.

Soraya was a graphic designer at Squaresoft for Final Fantasy IV: Easy Type, Romancing SaGa, Final Fantasy V, and Final Fantasy VI, She helped create the characterization for Final Fantasy VI characters Edgar and Sabin, beginning by choosing two playable character classes, in this case monk and machinist, choosing the desert as a setting, and then creating an extensive character background in a private booklet for herself. =Xenogears/Xenosaga= Soraya and her husband Tetsuya Takahashi submitted a script for Final Fantasy VII which was called \\"too dark\\" and \\"complicated\\" for a fantasy game, but were allowed to start a new project based on the script, which was worked into a full treatment with cutscenes, eventually being released under the name Xenogears. The story was inspired by the writing pair's interest in Jung, Nietzsche, and Freud, addressing questions of \\"where do we come from, what are we, where are we going\\". Soraya and Takahashi went on to write the plot of Xenosaga Episode I, Xenosaga Episode II, and Xenosaga Pied Piper. Xenosaga's use of many religious references reflected Soraya's interest in belief and its power. KOS-MOS was designed by Takahashi, reflecting a reversed view of human construction, giving the character a powerful body and fragile soul. Several designs that were not used were created by designers Kunihiko Tanaka and Kouichi Mugitani. Originally intended to be six games, the series was cut short, and many plot points had to be changed and moved because of the second episode's plot. At some point during the production of Xenosaga Episode II, Saga was informed that her services would no longer be needed in the production of the remaining installments of the series. =Later works= She also helped develop the story for Soma Bringer.

His magazine writing included pieces for the men's adventure magazines Saga, Stag, and Blue Book, and the more general-interest Coronet.

The credit, \\"Written by Laughin' Leon Lazarus,\\" contains an example of the alliterative endearments common in Marvel credits of the time. Leon Lazarus was born in The Bronx, New York City, the youngest among siblings Sid Lazarus (March 12, 1912 ‚Äì circa 1973) and Harry Lazarus (born February 22, 1917), both of whom became comic book artists.Leon and Marjorie Lazarus interview, He was drafted in the U.S. Army in 1942, and did World War II service in Italy, teaching the use of the then-new technology radar for the Signal Corps. He was honorably discharged in 1945, and married the future Marjorie Lazarus (born March 21, 1922)Interview, Alter Ego, p. 51 in May 1946. With the help of friend Bob Landers, an inker for Timely Comics, Lazarus was hired as a staff letterer there by Gary Keller, head of Timely's production department, in November 1947, earning $40 a week.Interview, Alter Ego, p. 49 Having written for the Signal Corps and wanting to write for comics, Lazarus after three weeks approached Dave Berg, a staff editor, who purchased a teen-humor story from him. Lazarus then became an associate editor under Don Rico, another staff editor, earning $60 a week plus an additional $40 a week for his freelance writing at the company. Among his duties was to oversee the work of the staff letterers, who then included Mario Aquaviva and Art Simek, and the proofreaders, who included Polly Schwartz and Adele Hasan, future wife of cartoonist and Mad magazine founder Harvey Kurtzman.Interview, Alter Ego, pp. 47‚Äì48 When Berg, Rico and fellow editor Ernie Hart moved on, later in the 1940s, Lazarus worked as an assistant to Al Jaffee, who came in as editor of the teen-humor line. As cartoonist and comics commentator Fred Hembeck observed, \\"Leon read through all the submissions, weeding out the junk and only passing on the worthwhile material to Jaffee; and Leon had mastered the ability to improve a six-pager with just a few judicious edits. Plus, Al really liked the guy. Basically, Jaffee found him indispensable\\". Among the writers with whom Lazarus worked as an editor as Patricia Highsmith, the future novelist, whose early career included writing romance comics for Timely/Atlas.Interview, Alter Ego, p.50 Marjorie Lazarus in 1948 and 1949 separately contributed \\"44 or 45\\" two-page text-filler stories. She was assigned these freelance pieces not by her husband, but by Joellen Murdock, a secretary who made those assignments. Leon Lazarus wrote approximately 40 of these, in addition to what he estimated were \\"over 800 comic book stories.\\" Lazarus was let go from Timely, along with virtually all the staff save for editor-in-chief Stan Lee and secretary Murdock, on a Friday in January 1950.Interview, Alter Ego, pp. 50‚Äì52 =Magazine Management= After leaving Timely, Lazarus freelanced for the company as it transitioned to being known as Atlas Comics during the 1950s. Under editor-in-chief Stan Lee, his work there, he recalled in a late-2000s interview, included the Western comic books Black Rider, The Arizona Kid and Kid Colt, Outlaw. Lazarus additionally wrote for Ziff-Davis, under editor Jerry Siegel, doing stories for Kid Cowboy, G.I. Joe (unrelated to the later Hasbro action figures) and other comic books for about a year, and also did work for the writer/artist team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, and for American Comics Group (AGC), under editor Richard E. Hughes.Interview, Alter Ego, pp. 56‚Äì57 Shortly after Atlas briefly suspended publishing in 1957, following the collapse of the company's newsstand distributor, Lazarus began writing for Magazine Management, the parent company owned by publisher Martin Goodman. Under editor Noah Sarlett, Lazarus said, \\"I wrote 350 stories for their men's magazines, going into the 1960s. I also worked for [staff editor and future best-selling author] Bruce Jay Friedman.\\"Interview, Alter Ego, p. 57 When Lazarus himself was briefly employed as a staff editor there, he worked with such staff writers as Mario Puzo, future author of The Godfather. Lazarus had two public credits during the 1960s Silver Age of comic books: the suspense-mystery story \\"Wes Wilson, Worry-Wart\\" in the American Comics Group (AGC) comic Unknown Worlds #6 (March 1961); and the Giant-Man superhero story \\"When Attuma Strikes\\" in Tales to Astonish #64 (Feb. 1965). His Marvel Comics credit, during the period in which the former Timely/Atlas began establishing itself as a significant force in popular culture, came about, Lazarus recalled, when publisher Goodman Family Lazarus' brothers, Harry Lazarus and Sid Lazarus, did magazine illustrations, and Harry as well variously penciled or both wrote and drew stories for a number of comic book companies from 1944 to the mid-1960s.Harry Lazarus at the Grand Comics Database He was living in West Orange, New Jersey, at the time of his death at age 89.

A prototype version was first shown to the public on August 20, 2005 at the Classic Gaming Expo in Burlingame, California. The completed game began shipping to pre-order customers on May 22, 2006, at the price of US$40 per copy. Beggar Prince was the first game for the Sega Genesis to be commercially released in North America since 1998. Technical information For a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game, Beggar Prince is rather large, weighing in at 32-megabits (4 megabytes) in size. Players could record their progress to any of the four available save slots. The game shipped within a plastic clamshell case along with a glossy, full-color 27-page instruction manual. The game's unique cartridge hardware was designed by Kim Biu Wong, head of Tototek, and Super Fighter Team president Brandon Cobb. All pieces were manufactured in China.Sega-16 Forums - View Single Post - Beggar Prince: Official Thread Beggar Prince works with any Sega Genesis (with the exception of Sega Genesis Firecore), Mega Drive or Nomad system, regardless of its region (NTSC and PAL are both supported). But for the first two runs, due to the manner in which the game's save function is programmed, it is impossible to save on systems connected to the 32X or hybrid CD systems such as the Multi-Mega/CDX and Wondermega. Playing the game with a Sega Mega-CD/Sega CD attached to the Mega Drive/Genesis works with the second CD model. On a European Multi-Mega, the game resets itself after the introduction scenes, making it unplayable. The third production run is notable as the box and manual art were changed and, more importantly, the game's save feature had been re-programmed to allow full functionality with all Genesis, Mega Drive and compatible systems (such as the Nomad, 32X, CDX, X'Eye, Laseractive and so on). Availability Beggar Prince began shipping to pre- order customers on May 22, 2006. By September 8, 2006, all 600 copies had been sold. However, on October 18, 2006, Super Fighter Team announced that they had begun taking pre-orders for a second production run of 300 copies. On June 19, 2007, this production run had also sold through. The third production run, introducing several changes, became available for pre-ordering on October 9, 2007 and started shipping on November 27, 2007. In total, the game sold 1,500 copies. On August 6, 2013, the game was released for Windows and Mac OS X, in the form of a compilation package of three Super Fighter Team RPGs, the other two being Legend of Wukong and Star Odyssey. Critical reception Beggar Prince was perhaps the most widely publicized new game for a retrogame system, being featured and reviewed in gaming magazines across the world such as Tips & Tricks, Hardcore Gamer, Play, Retro Gamer, Edge, GamesTM, Super Play and Master Player, among others, and having been sold to people in over 25 countries. Although it received critical acclaim upon its release, gamers soon discovered a few glitches in the game. While Super Fighter Team had spent over a year working out the bugs left behind by C&E;, it was simply not cost efficient to fix them all. While most of these errors were trivial, one or two could result in the game's main character getting stuck in a certain place where he was not supposed to be, meaning the player would have to backtrack by loading a previously saved game. Fortunately, the majority of the glitches present in the original Chinese release have been fixed. References =Notes= External links *Official site *Sega Genesis Lives!

Prior to his time in the NFL, he was the starting quarterback for the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League and the Frankfurt Galaxy of the World League of American Football. He played college football at Arizona State University. Early years Justin attended Schaumburg High School, before moving on to Arizona State University. He became the starter at quarterback in the seventh game of his sophomore season, after passing Daniel Ford on the depth chart. He completed 56% (84 of 150) of his passes, threw for 1,063 yards, 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, while helping the team post a 6‚Äì5 record. In 1989, he completed 33 of 47 passes for 534 yards (school- record) and 4 touchdowns in a 44‚Äì39 upset of No. 23 ranked Washington State University. He finished the season with a 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 record, 2,591 yards, 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. In 1990, the Sun Devils opened the season with victories over Baylor University and Colorado State University, but would lose 4 consecutive games, 3 of them while Justin was out with a dislocated left shoulder suffered during a 30‚Äì9 loss against the University of Missouri. He also spent two days in a hospital with a probable case of appendicitis, that was later diagnosed as a gastrointestinal problem and caused him to lose 17 pounds. He posted a 4‚Äì7 record, 1,876 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Professional career =Chicago Bears= Justin was selected by the Chicago Bears in the seventh round (190th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. He was waived on August 26 and later signed to the practice squad. He was cut on August 31, 1992. =Arizona Rattlers= Justin played flag football, before signing with the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League in 1993. He completed 226 of 404 passes, for 2,846 yards, 45 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. =Indianapolis Colts= On April 11, 1994, he signed with the Indianapolis Colts, but was released on August 28. He was re-signed in 1995 and was allocated to the Frankfurt Galaxy of the World League of American Football, after basically being out of football for two years. He led his team to the World Bowl III championship. In 1995, he started one game and also shared playing time with Jim Harbaugh against the New Orleans Saints. He also played a brief time against the Buffalo Bills on November 5. The next year, he started 2 games, winning both of them. In 1997, he started 4 games, while Harbaugh recovered from a fractured right hand he suffered when he scuffled with NBC sportscaster Jim Kelly. Against the Buffalo Bills, he was winning 26‚Äì0 in the first half, but the lead disappeared after the Bills outscored the Colts 30‚Äì3, Justin made it close again at 37‚Äì35 with 14 seconds remaining, but could not complete the potential game-tying two-point conversion. The Bills recovery from a 26-point deficit at the time was the second-largest comeback in NFL history. Coming in with an 0‚Äì10 record against the defending Super Bowl champions Green Bay Packers, he led the team to a 41‚Äì38 win, completing 24-of-30 attempts for 340 passing yards. On December 5, he was placed on the injured reserve list. On March 26, 1998, he was traded the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (#135-Antony Jordan). =Cincinnati Bengals= The Cincinnati Bengals acquired him after the retirement of Boomer Esiason to compete with Jeff Blake for the starting job. He appeared in 5 games with 3 starts, before being cut on April 20, 1999. =Oakland Raiders= On August 18, 1999, he was signed as a free agent by the Oakland Raiders. On August 30, he was traded to the St. Louis Rams in exchange for a seven-round draft choice (#238-Rodregis Brooks). =St. Louis Rams (first stint)= The St. Louis Rams acquired Justin to provide depth at quarterback, after Trent Green suffered a serious left knee injury in the last preseason game and Kurt Warner was named the new starter. He was a part of the Super Bowl XXXIV winning team. =Dallas Cowboys= On March 30, 2000, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys, to replace the departed Jason Garrett as the backup quarterback. After struggling in preseason (he accounted for 6 critical turnovers in the first two games) and the signing of Randall Cunningham, he was waived injured on August 24. =St. Louis Rams (second stint)= On May 1, 2001, he signed with the St. Louis Rams. On August 10, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.

The pump intake is either connected to the public underground water supply piping, or a static water source (e.g., tank, reservoir, lake). The pump provides water flow at a higher pressure to the sprinkler system risers and hose standpipes. A fire pump is tested and listed for its use specifically for fire service by a third-party testing and listing agency, such as UL or FM Global. The main code that governs fire pump installations in North America is the National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 20 Standard for the Installation of Stationary Fire Pumps for Fire Protection. Fire pumps function either by an electric motor or a diesel engine, or, occasionally a steam turbine. If the local building code requires power independent of the local electric power grid, a pump using an electric motor may utilize, when connected via a listed transfer switch, the installation of an emergency generator. The fire pump starts when the pressure in the fire sprinkler system drops below a threshold. The sprinkler system pressure drops significantly when one or more fire sprinklers are exposed to heat above their design temperature, and opens, releasing water. Alternately, other fire hoses reels or other firefighting connections are opened, causing a pressure drop in the fire fighting main. Fire pumps are needed when the local municipal water system cannot provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system. This usually occurs if the building is very tall, such as in high-rise buildings, or in systems that require a relatively high terminal pressure at the fire sprinkler in order to provide a large volume of water, such as in storage warehouses. Fire pumps are also needed if fire protection water supply is provided from a ground level water storage tank. Types of pumps used for fire service include: horizontal split case, vertical split case, vertical inline, vertical turbine, and end suction. Fire pumps, circulation relief valve Each pump shall have a circulation relief valve listed for the fire pump service installed and set below the shutoff pressure at minimum expected suction pressure. Exception: This rule shall not apply to engine-driven pumps for which engine cooling water is taken from the pump discharge.https://www.fmglobal.com/assets/pdf/fmapprovals/1319.pdf FM Global, Standards for Fire Pumps Jockey pump A jockey pump is a small pump connected to a fire sprinkler system and is intended to maintain pressure in a fire protection piping system to an artificially high level so that the operation of a single fire sprinkler will cause a pressure drop which will be sensed by the fire pump automatic controller, causing the fire pump to start. The jockey pump is essentially a portion of the fire pump's control system. A jockey pump is sized for a flow less than the flow to one sprinkler in order to ensure a system pressure drop. Jockey pumps are typically small multistage centrifugal pumps, and do not have to be listed or certified for fire system application. The control equipment for jockey pumps may however carry approvals. Jockey pumps should be sized for 3% of the flow of the main fire pump and to provide 10psi more pressure than the main fire pump (As per Code IS 15105 : 2002) =In the U.S.= The application of a jockey pump in a fire protection system is provided by NFPA 20. They are inspected per NFPA 25 \\"Inspection and Testing of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems\\". =In India= In India, the pump manufacturers generally adhere to the TAC (Tariff Advisory Committee) guidelines, although pump manufacturers also obtain listings with UL or FM Global. For the purpose of installation & maintenance of fire-fighting pumps, Bureau of Indian Standards has published IS 15301 which is being followed throughout India. Portable Home Fire Pump Portable Fire Pump and hose systems are being used by fire departments and homeowners to defend homes from burning down in a wildfire. These portable gas powered fire pumps use a suction hose that draws water from a water source such as a swimming pool, water tank, or lake. The fire hose that is connected to the fire pump is used to spray down structures on the property and surrounding brush.

It is celebrated as the home of the famous Wessobrunn Prayer and also of a Baroque school of stucco workers and plasterers in the 18th century. History The monastery was founded in about 753, and dedicated to Saint Peter, according to legend after Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria while hunting nearby had a vision of three springs, which his servant Wezzo duly discovered the next day. (The name means Wesso or Wezzo's spring(s)). The three springs are still to be seen, but there is otherwise no evidence of the truth of the story, and it is likely that the founders were a local noble family called Rott. The first monks came from Niederaltaich Abbey under Ilsung, the first abbot. The church was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. During the rule of the second abbot, Adelmar (799-831), the monastery was transferred from the Diocese of Brixen to that of Augsburg. In 788 Wessobrunn became a Carolingian Empire Imperial abbey (i.e., independent of other terrorial lordships and answerable only to the monarchy) In about 900 it became a property of the Bishop of Augsburg. In 955 the abbey was destroyed by the Hungarians, on which occasion Abbot Thiente and six of his monks suffered martyrdom, while the remaining three fled to Andechs with the sacred relics. The site was then occupied by canons until 1065, when the provost Adalbero restored the Rule of St. Benedict and governed as abbot until his death in 1110. In the first year of his abbacy the monastic church was rebuilt and was dedicated by Bishop Embrico of Augsburg. Adalbero was succeeded by Sigihard (1110-28), during whose reign a separate church was built for the people of the surrounding area, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist in 1128. Under Blessed Waltho (1129-57) Wessobrunn enjoyed its first era of great spiritual and temporal prosperity. He was responsible for a number of unusually fine buildings. Also under Waltho the nunnery attached to the abbey between about 1100 and 1220 was of note as the home of Blessed Wulfhildis and Diemoth. Fragments of medieval sculpture from the former abbey church, now in the Bavarian National Museum In or around 1220 the church burnt down, and the monastery complex was extensively rebuilt at this time. In 1401 the abbots of Wessobrunn were granted the right of pontifical insignia. A new era of great prosperity began with the accession of Ulrich Stocklin (1438-43), who had previously been a monk at Tegernsee Abbey and acquired considerable fame as a writer of sacred hymns.Abbot Heinrich Zach (1498-1508) installed a printing press at the monastery. In 1680 Abbot Leonard Weiss (1671-96) began the rebuilding of the church and monastery on a far more lavish scale in the Baroque style, using the abbey's own stuccoists. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Bavarian Congregation in 1684 and joined his abbey to it. The abbey was dissolved in 1803 in the course of the secularisation of Bavaria, when it came into the possession of a certain De Montot. From 1810 the site was extensively exploited for building materials to rebuild the nearby town of Weilheim, which had been damaged in a fire. What remained in 1861 was saved by Professor Johann Nepomuk Sepp, who bought the site and preserved it. In 1900 it was acquired by Baron von Cramer-Klett. Literary production From the 16th century to the secularisation of Wessobrunn in 1803, its monks displayed a continuous rare literary activity and some of them acquired fame as authors and teachers in various schools of Germany. Among the best known are: the historians Stephan Leopolder (d. 1532) and C√∂lestin Leutner (d. 1759); the theologians Thomas Ringmayr (d. 1652), Thomas Erhard (d. 1743), Veremund Eisvogl (d. 1761), Alphonse Campi (d. 1769), Ulrich Mittermayr (d. 1770), Virgil Sedlmayr (d. 1772), Sympert Schwarzhuber (d. 1795); the canonists Gregor Zallwein (d. 1766) and Johann Kleinmayern (the last abbot of Wessobrunn; d. 1810); and the librarian and scientist Anselm Ellinger (d. 1816). Among these Leutner, Campi, Eisvogl, and Mittermayr collaborated in the edition of a large concordance of the Bible which was published in 1751. Wessobrunn Prayer This famous piece of Christian literature was not produced at Wessobrunn itself but was preserved in the monastic library for centuries, until at the secularisation the library contents were transferred to the Bavarian State Library, where the manuscript is now located.

About NAPF‚Äôs mission is to \\"educate and train people of all ages and backgrounds to solve the most dangerous technological, social, and psychological issues of our time, and to survive and thrive in the 21st century.\\" Its vision is \\"a world in which people are as well-trained in waging peace as soldiers currently are in waging war.\\" NAPF engages in advocacy and education programs. Its educational projects include the Sunflower e-newsletter, which provides monthly information and analysis of nuclear and international security issues, and its Nuclear Files, which chronicles the history of nuclear weapons. NAPF works with elected officials and decision-makers around the world to advocate for nuclear weapons abolition. In addition, NAPF runs Peace Leadership training programs and hosts special events to honor peace leaders and pay tribute to the victims of nuclear weapons and war. Nuclear Zero In 2014, the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation consulted with the Marshall Islands when it filed cases against the nine nuclear-armed countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Israel, India, Pakistan, North Korea) in the International Court of Justice and U.S. Federal District Court. The lawsuits make the central claim that these nations have failed to comply with their obligations under international law to pursue negotiations aimed at the complete elimination of their nuclear weapons. Five of the nuclear-armed countries are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Article VI of the NPT requires that parties \\"pursue negotiations in good faith\\" aimed at \\"complete disarmament.\\" The lawsuits contend that the other four countries, while not bound to the NPT, are obligated by customary international law to pursue nuclear disarmament. Presenting evidence that all nine nuclear-armed countries continue to update and enhance their nuclear arsenals while failing to take disarmament negotiations seriously, the lawsuits allege that each nuclear-armed country is in breach of its international obligations. The case filed in the U.S. Federal District Court is particularly historic, as it is the first time that the U.S. has been charged in domestic court for violation of an international disarmament treaty.

It allows importing/saving, viewing, organizing, tagging, editing, and sharing large numbers of digital images.What is Lightroom Unlike Photoshop, Lightroom's edits are always non- destructive by keeping the original image and the edits applied to it saved separately. Despite sharing its name with Adobe Photoshop, it cannot perform many Photoshop functions such as doctoring (adding, removing or altering the appearance of individual image items), rendering text or 3D objects on images, or modifying individual video frames. Lightroom is not a file manager like Adobe Bridge. It cannot operate on files unless they are imported into its database first, and only in recognized image formats. Initially, Adobe Lightroom was one product only. But as of 2017, it has become a family of products consisting of Lightroom Classic, Lightroom (desktop), and Lightroom Mobile. While similar, these two products have significant differences, mainly in how they store images and interact with Adobe's cloud storage offering, and in feature parity.  Overview  Lightroom Classic https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.htmlis focused on the following workflow steps: ;Library: Similar in concept to the 'Organizer' in Adobe Photoshop Elements and other image organizers, this module imports and exports images, creates image collections, organizes images by their metadata, and adds ratings to them. Library is the gateway into Lightroom. ;Develop:Supports non-destructive editing of images en masse. This module is more for retouching, i.e., enhancing and improving digital photographs, including changing color balance, improving tone, removing red-eye effect, sharpening, reducing noise, cropping, straightening or converting to black- and-white. It cannot create or edit non-photographic images (such as drawings, symbols, line arts or diagrams or maps), or render text or 3D objects. It has very limited photo doctoring features. TIFF, JPEG, PSD (Photoshop), PNG, CMYK (edited in RGB color space) and raw image formats are supported. It has several standard presets for color correction or effects, and supports sharing custom presets online. Another often used feature in the Develop module is the ability to synchronize edits from one selected photo to the whole selection. ;Map: Added in Lightroom 4, it facilitates geographically organizing photos based on embedded or manually added geolocation data (since end of 2018 this is no longer supported for up to Lightroom CC 2015.x / Lightroom 6.x). ;Book: Added in Lightroom 4, it allows creating photobooks. ;Slideshow:Allows creating slideshows from any number of photos, to which music or a background can be added. ;Print: Prints images. Printing parameters such as layout and orientation can be adjusted. ;Web: Creates a web gallery for website owners. Several templates to influence layout are available. Tethered Capture Support for many popular Nikon and Canon DSLRs.  History  In 1999, veteran Photoshop developer Mark Hamburg began a new project, code-named Shadowland (a reference to the 1988 KD Lang music album of same nameThe Digital Negative, Book by Jeff Schewe). Hamburg contacted Andrei Herasimchuk, former interface designer for the Adobe Creative Suite, to start the project. It was an intentional departure from many of Adobe's established conventions. Forty percent of Photoshop Lightroom is written in the scripting language Lua. In 2002, Hamburg left the Photoshop project and in fall of the same year he sent a first experimental software sample, name PixelToy, to his former teammate Jeff Schewe for review; in 2003, Hamburg presented Schewe a first version of Shadowland in a very early UI version. After a few years of research by Hamburg, Herasimchuk, Sandy Alves (the former interface designer on the Photoshop team), and Grace Kim (a product researcher at Adobe), the Shadowland project accelerated around 2004. However, Herasimchuk chose to leave Adobe Systems at that time to start a Silicon Valley design company. Hamburg then chose Phil Clevenger, a former associate of Kai Krause, to design a new look for the application. Photoshop Lightroom's developers work mostly in Minnesota, comprising the team that had already created the program Adobe ImageReady. Troy Gaul, Melissa Gaul, and the rest of their crew (reportedly known as the \\"Minnesota Phats\\"), with Hamburg, developed the architecture behind the application. George Jardine was the product manager. = Beta development = On January 9, 2006, an early version of Photoshop Lightroom, formerly named only Lightroom, was released to the public as a Macintosh-only public beta, on the Adobe Labs website. This was the first Adobe product released to the general public for feedback during its development. This method was later used in developing Adobe Photoshop CS3. On June 26, 2006, Adobe announced that it had acquired the technology of Pixmantec, developers of the Rawshooter image processing software. Further beta releases followed. Notable releases included Beta 3 on July 18, 2006, which added support for Microsoft Windows systems. On September 25, 2006, Beta 4 was released, which saw the program merged into the Photoshop product range, followed by a minor update on October 19, which was released as Beta 4.1. = Version 1.0 = On January 29, 2007, Adobe announced that Lightroom would ship on February 19, 2007, list priced at $299 US, ¬£199 UK. Lightroom v1.x is not updated when an upgrade to v2 is installed; a new serial number is needed. = Version 2.0 = Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2.0 Beta was advertised in official emails from Adobe in April 2008. New features included: * Localized corrections: edit specific parts of an image * Improved organization tools * Multiple monitor support * Flexible printing options * 64-bit support The official release of Lightroom v2 was on July 29, 2008, along with the release of Adobe Camera Raw v4.5 and DNG Converter 4.5. Adobe added DNG Camera Profiling to both releases. This technology allows custom camera color profiles, or looks, to be created and saved by users. It also allows profiles matching the creative styles built into cameras to be replicated. At the same time as the Lightroom v2 release, Adobe [through Adobe Labs] released a full set of such Camera Profiles for Nikon and Canon models, along with basic Standard Profiles for all supported makes and models. This technology is open to all programs compliant with the DNG file format standard. = Version 3.0 = Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3.0 beta was released on October 22, 2009. New features included: * New chroma noise reduction * Improved sharpening tool * New import pseudo module * Watermarking * Grain * Publish services * Custom package for print On March 23, 2010, Adobe released a second beta, which added the following features: * New luminance noise reduction * Tethered shooting for selected Nikon and Canon cameras * Basic video file support * Point curve Although not included in any beta release, version 3 also contains built-in lens correction and perspective control. The final version was released on June 8, 2010 with no major new functions added. It had all the features included in the betas, added the lens corrections and perspective transformations, and a few more improvements and performance optimizations. = Version 4.0 = Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4.0 was officially released on March 5, 2012 after being available in beta format since January 10, 2012. It does not support Windows XP. New features included: * Highlight and shadow recovery to bring out detail in dark shadows and bright highlights * Photo book creation with templates * Location-based organization to find and group images by location, assign locations to images, and display data from GPS-enabled cameras * White balance brush to refine and adjust white balance in specific areas of images * Added local editing controls to adjust noise reduction and remove moir√© in targeted areas * Extended video support to organize, view, and make adjustments and edits to video clips * Video publishing tools to edit and share video clips on Facebook and Flickr * Soft proofing to preview images when printed with color-managed printers * Email from within Lightroom = Version 5.0 = Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.0 was officially released on June 9, 2013 after being available in beta format since April 15, 2013. The program needs Mac OS X 10.7 or later, or Windows 7 or 8.

August 8, 2016. = Development branches = Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic CC (unofficially: version 7.0) was officially released on October 18, 2017. It is the first version of Lightroom that is not available with a perpetual license (one-time purchase price); instead, it must be licensed through a monthly subscription model, with the fee initially set at US$9.99/month. Once the user stops paying the monthly fee, the program will be limited to viewing existing catalogs, without the ability to apply further changes to images. Adobe Lightroom CC is the new online cloud-based version of Adobe's Lightroom application and can be installed alongside Lightroom Classic CC. It is included in the same US$9.99/month photography plan, but has limited editing features in comparison to Lightroom Classic CC. It can be installed on desktops, laptops, iPad and mobile. Lightroom CC has the ability to sync developed photos easily between a laptop, iPad and mobile devices, which is the major difference between both applications. Its user interface is also more similar to that of Adobe's mobile version of the applications. =Adobe Lightroom Classic CC= * Version 8.0 have been released on * Version 8.1 () * Version 8.2 () * Version 8.2.1 () * Version 8.3 () * Version 8.3.1 () * Version 8.4 () * Version 8.4.1 () * Version 9.0 have been released on * Version 9.1 () * Version 9.2 () * Version 9.2.1 () * Version 9.3 () * Version 9.4 () In June 2020, Adobe released an update to Lightroom Classic, with improved features.

The question was a major intellectual controversy, which began simmering in 1699 and broke out in full force in 1711. Leibniz had published his work first, but Newton's supporters accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton's unpublished ideas. Leibniz died in disfavor in 1716 after his patron, the Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain in 1714. The modern consensus is that the two men developed their ideas independently. Newton claimed to have begun working on a form of calculus (which he called \\"the method of fluxions and fluents\\") in 1666, at the age of 23, but did not publish it except as a minor annotation in the back of one of his publications decades later (a relevant Newton manuscript of October 1666 is now published among his mathematical papersD T Whiteside (ed.), The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton (Volume 1), (Cambridge University Press, 1967), part 7 \\"The October 1666 Tract on Fluxions\\", at page 400, in 2008 reprint.). Gottfried Leibniz began working on his variant of calculus in 1674, and in 1684 published his first paper employing it, \\"Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis\\". L'H√¥pital published a text on Leibniz's calculus in 1696 (in which he recognized that Newton's Principia of 1687 was \\"nearly all about this calculus\\"). Meanwhile, Newton, though he explained his (geometrical) form of calculus in Section I of Book I of the Principia of 1687,Section I of Book I of the Principia, explaining \\"the method of first and last ratios\\", a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus, as recognized both in Newton's time and in modern times ‚Äì see citations above by L'Hospital (1696), Truesdell (1968) and Whiteside (1970) ‚Äì is available online in its English translation of 1729, at page 41. did not explain his eventual fluxional notation for the calculusMarquis de l'H√¥pital's original words about the 'Principia': \\"lequel est presque tout de ce calcul\\": see the preface to his Analyse des Infiniment Petits (Paris, 1696). The Principia has been called \\"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\\" also in modern times: see Clifford Truesdell, Essays in the History of Mechanics (Berlin, 1968), at p.99; for a similar view of another modern scholar see also in print until 1693 (in part) and 1704 (in full).  Scientific priority in the 17th century  In the XVII century, as at the present time, the question of scientific priority was of great importance to scientists. However, during this period, scientific journals had just begun to appear, and the generally accepted mechanism for fixing priority by publishing information about the discovery had not yet been formed. Among the methods used by scientists were anagrams, sealed envelopes placed in a safe place, correspondence with other scientists, or a private message. A letter to the founder of the French Academy of Sciences, Marin Mersenne for a French scientist, or the secretary of the Royal Society of London, Henry Oldenburg for English, had practically the status of an published article. The discoverer, in addition to acquiring fame, was spared the need to prove that his result was not obtained using plagiarism. Also, practical importance could have priority if it was associated with the invention of new technical devices. A widespread strategy of attacking priority was to declare a discovery or invention not a major achievement, but only an improvement, using techniques known to everyone and therefore not requiring considerable skill of its author. A series of high-profile disputes about the scientific priority of the 17th century ‚Äì the era that the American science historian D. Meli called \\"the golden age of the mud-slinging priority disputes\\" ‚Äì is associated with the name Leibniz. The first of them occurred at the beginning of 1673, during his first visit to London, when in the presence of the famous mathematician John Pell he presented his method of approximating series by differences. To Pell‚Äôs remark that this discovery had already been made by Fran√ßois Regnaud and published in 1670 in Lyon by Gabriel Mouton, Leibniz answered the next day.http://www.math.rutgers.edu/courses/436/Honors02/leibniz.htmlNicholas Jolley, Leibniz (2005), p. 17. In a letter to Oldenburg, he wrote that, having looked at Mouton's book, he admits Pell was right, but in his defense he can provide his draft notes, which contain nuances not found by Renault and Mouton. Thus, the integrity of Leibniz was proved, but this case he was recalled later.Oldenburg's report on this incident is contained in Newton's papers, but it is not known that he attached importance to it. On the same visit to London, Leibniz was in the opposite position. February 1, 1673 at a meeting of the Royal Society of London, he demonstrated his mechanical calculator. The curator of the experiments of the Society, Robert Hook, carefully examined the device and even removed the back cover for this. A few days later, in the absence of Leibniz, Hook criticized the German scientist's machine, saying that he could make a simpler model. Leibniz, who learned about this, returned to Paris and categorically rejected Hooke‚Äôs claim in a letter to Oldenburg and formulated principles of correct scientific behavior: \\"We know that respectable and modest people prefer it when they think of something that is consistent with what someone's done other discoveries, ascribe their own improvements and additions to the discoverer, so as not to arouse suspicions of intellectual dishonesty, and the desire for true generosity should pursue them, instead of the lying thirst for dishonest profit.\\" To illustrate the proper behavior, Leibniz gives an example of Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc and Pierre Gassendi, who performed astronomical observations similar to those made earlier by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Hevelius, respectively. Learning that they did not make their discoveries first, French scientists passed on their data to the discoverers. Newton's approach to the priority problem can be illustrated by the example of the discovery of the inverse-square law as applied to the dynamics of bodies moving under the influence of gravity. Based on an analysis of Kepler's laws and his own calculations, Robert Hooke made the assumption that motion under such conditions should occur along orbits similar to elliptical. Unable to rigorously prove this claim, he reported it to Newton. Without further entering into correspondence with Hooke, Newton solved this problem, as well as the inverse to it, proving that the law of inverse-squares follows from the ellipticity of the orbits. This discovery was set forth in his famous work Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica without indicating the name Hooke. At the insistence of astronomer Edmund Halley, to whom the manuscript was handed over for editing and publication, the phrase was included in the text that the compliance of Kepler's first law with the law of inverse squares was \\"independently approved by Wren, Hooke and Halley.\\" According to the remark of Vladimir Arnold, Newton, choosing between refusal to publish his discoveries and constant struggle for priority, chose both of them. Background = Invention of differential and integral calculus = Pascal's differential triangle By the time of Newton and Leibniz, European mathematicians had already made a significant contribution to the formation of the ideas of mathematical analysis. The Dutchman Simon Stevin (1548-1620), the Italian Luca Valerio (1553-1618), the German Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) were engaged in the development of the ancient \\"method of exhaustion\\" for calculating areas and volumes. The latter's ideas, apparently, influenced ‚Äì directly or through Galileo Galilei ‚Äì on the \\"method of indivisibles\\" developed by Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647). The last years of Leibniz's life, 1710‚Äì1716, were embittered by a long controversy with John Keill, Newton, and others, over whether Leibniz had discovered calculus independently of Newton, or whether he had merely invented another notation for ideas that were fundamentally Newton's. No participant doubted that Newton had already developed his method of fluxions when Leibniz began working on the differential calculus, yet there was seemingly no proof beyond Newton's word. He had published a calculation of a tangent with the note: \\"This is only a special case of a general method whereby I can calculate curves and determine maxima, minima, and centers of gravity.\\" How this was done he explained to a pupil a full 20 years later, when Leibniz's articles were already well-read. Newton's manuscripts came to light only after his death. The infinitesimal calculus can be expressed either in the notation of fluxions or in that of differentials, or, as noted above, it was also expressed by Newton in geometrical form, as in the Principia of 1687. Newton employed fluxions as early as 1666, but did not publish an account of his notation until 1693. The earliest use of differentials in Leibniz's notebooks may be traced to 1675. He employed this notation in a 1677 letter to Newton. The differential notation also appeared in Leibniz's memoir of 1684. The claim that Leibniz invented the calculus independently of Newton rests on the basis that Leibniz: # published a description of his method some years before Newton printed anything on fluxions, # always alluded to the discovery as being his own invention (this statement went unchallenged for some years), # enjoyed the strong presumption that he acted in good faith, and # demonstrated in his private papers his development of the ideas of calculus in a manner independent of the path taken by Newton. According to Leibniz's detractors, the fact that Leibniz's claim went unchallenged for some years is immaterial. To rebut this case it is sufficient to show that he: * saw some of Newton's papers on the subject in or before 1675 or at least 1677, and * obtained the fundamental ideas of the calculus from those papers. No attempt was made to rebut #4, which was not known at the time, but which provides the strongest of the evidence that Leibniz came to the calculus independently from Newton. This evidence, however, is still questionable based on the discovery, in the inquest and after, that Leibniz both back-dated and changed fundamentals of his \\"original\\" notes, not only in this intellectual conflict, but in several others. He also published \\"anonymous\\" slanders of Newton regarding their controversy which he tried, initially, to claim he was not author of. If good faith is nevertheless assumed, however, Leibniz's notes as presented to the inquest came first to integration, which he saw as a generalization of the summation of infinite series, whereas Newton began from derivatives. However, to view the development of calculus as entirely independent between the work of Newton and Leibniz misses the point that both had some knowledge of the methods of the other (though Newton did develop most fundamentals before Leibniz started) and in fact worked together on a few aspects, in particular power series, as is shown in a letter to Henry Oldenburg dated 24 October 1676, where Newton remarks that Leibniz had developed a number of methods, one of which was new to him.The manuscript, written mostly in Latin, is numbered Add. 3977.4; it is contained in the library at the University of Cambridge. See this page for more details. Both Leibniz and Newton could see by this exchange of letters that the other was far along towards the calculus (Leibniz in particular mentions it) but only Leibniz was prodded thereby into publication. That Leibniz saw some of Newton's manuscripts had always been likely. In 1849, C. I. Gerhardt, while going through Leibniz's manuscripts, found extracts from Newton's De Analysi per Equationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas (published in 1704 as part of the De Quadratura Curvarum but also previously circulated among mathematicians starting with Newton giving a copy to Isaac Barrow in 1669 and Barrow sending it to John Collins) in Leibniz's handwriting, the existence of which had been previously unsuspected, along with notes re-expressing the content of these extracts in Leibniz's differential notation. Hence when these extracts were made becomes all-important. It is known that a copy of Newton's manuscript had been sent to Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus in May 1675, a time when he and Leibniz were collaborating; it is not impossible that these extracts were made then. It is also possible that they may have been made in 1676, when Leibniz discussed analysis by infinite series with Collins and Oldenburg. It is probable that they would have then shown him the manuscript of Newton on that subject, a copy of which one or both of them surely possessed. On the other hand, it may be supposed that Leibniz made the extracts from the printed copy in or after 1704. Shortly before his death, Leibniz admitted in a letter to Abb√© Antonio Schinella Conti, that in 1676 Collins had shown him some of Newton's papers, but Leibniz also implied that they were of little or no value. Presumably he was referring to Newton's letters of 13 June and 24 October 1676, and to the letter of 10 December 1672, on the method of tangents, extracts from which accompanied the letter of 13 June. Whether Leibniz made use of the manuscript from which he had copied extracts, or whether he had previously invented the calculus, are questions on which no direct evidence is available at present. It is, however, worth noting that the unpublished Portsmouth Papers show that when Newton went carefully into the whole dispute in 1711, he picked out this manuscript as the one which had probably somehow fallen into Leibniz's hands. At that time there was no direct evidence that Leibniz had seen Newton's manuscript before it was printed in 1704; hence Newton's conjecture was not published. But Gerhardt's discovery of a copy made by Leibniz tends to confirm its accuracy. Those who question Leibniz's good faith allege that to a man of his ability, the manuscript, especially if supplemented by the letter of 10 December 1672, sufficed to give him a clue as to the methods of the calculus. Since Newton's work at issue did employ the fluxional notation, anyone building on that work would have to invent a notation, but some deny this. Development The quarrel was a retrospective affair. In 1696, already some years later than the events that became the subject of the quarrel, the position still looked potentially peaceful: Newton and Leibniz had each made limited acknowledgements of the other's work, and L'H√¥pital's 1696 book about the calculus from a Leibnizian point of view had also acknowledged Newton's published work of the 1680s as \\"nearly all about this calculus\\" (\\"presque tout de ce calcul\\"), while expressing preference for the convenience of Leibniz's notation. At first, there was no reason to suspect Leibniz's good faith. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss mathematician known for his work on the zodiacal light problem, accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton.G. V. Coyne, p. 112; Rupert Hall, Philosophers at War, pages 106‚Äì107; David Brewster, The Life of Sir Isaac Newton, p. 185 It was not until the 1704 publication of an anonymous review of Newton's tract on quadrature, a review implying that Newton had borrowed the idea of the fluxional calculus from Leibniz, that any responsible mathematician doubted that Leibniz had invented the calculus independently of Newton. With respect to the review of Newton's quadrature work, all admit that there was no justification or authority for the statements made therein, which were rightly attributed to Leibniz. But the subsequent discussion led to a critical examination of the whole question, and doubts emerged. Had Leibniz derived the fundamental idea of the calculus from Newton? The case against Leibniz, as it appeared to Newton's friends, was summed up in the Commercium Epistolicum of 1712, which referenced all allegations. This document was thoroughly machined by Newton. No such summary (with facts, dates, and references) of the case for Leibniz was issued by his friends; but Johann Bernoulli attempted to indirectly weaken the evidence by attacking the personal character of Newton in a letter dated 7 June 1713. When pressed for an explanation, Bernoulli most solemnly denied having written the letter. In accepting the denial, Newton added in a private letter to Bernoulli the following remarks, Newton's claimed reasons for why he took part in the controversy. He said, \\"I have never grasped at fame among foreign nations, but I am very desirous to preserve my character for honesty, which the author of that epistle, as if by the authority of a great judge, had endeavoured to wrest from me. Now that I am old, I have little pleasure in mathematical studies, and I have never tried to propagate my opinions over the world, but I have rather taken care not to involve myself in disputes on account of them.\\" Leibniz explained his silence as follows, in a letter to Conti dated 9 April 1716: While Leibniz's death put a temporary stop to the controversy, the debate persisted for many years. To Newton's staunch supporters this was a case of Leibniz's word against a number of contrary, suspicious details. His unacknowledged possession of a copy of part of one of Newton's manuscripts may be explicable; but it appears that on more than one occasion, Leibniz deliberately altered or added to important documents (e.g., the letter of 7 June 1713 in the Charta Volans, and that of 8 April 1716 in the Acta Eruditorum), before publishing them, and falsified a date on a manuscript (1675 being altered to 1673). All this casts doubt on his testimony. Considering Leibniz's intellectual prowess, as demonstrated by his other accomplishments, he had more than the requisite ability to invent the calculus. What he is alleged to have received was a number of suggestions rather than an account of calculus; it is possible, since he did not publish his results of 1677 until 1684 and since differential notation was his invention, that Leibniz minimized, 30 years later, any benefit he might have enjoyed from reading Newton's manuscript. Moreover, he may have seen the question of who originated the calculus as immaterial when set against the expressive power of his notation. In any event, a bias favoring Newton tainted the whole affair from the outset. The Royal Society, of which Isaac Newton was president at the time, set up a committee to pronounce on the priority dispute, in response to a letter it had received from Leibniz. That committee never asked Leibniz to give his version of the events. The report of the committee, finding in favor of Newton, was written and published as \\"Commercium Epistolicum\\" (mentioned above) by Newton early in 1713. But Leibniz did not see it until the autumn of 1714. The prevailing opinion in the 18th century was against Leibniz (in Britain, not in the German-speaking world). Today the consensus is that Leibniz and Newton independently invented and described the calculus in Europe in the 17th century. One author has identified the dispute as being about \\"profoundly different\\" methods: On the other hand, other authors have emphasized the equivalences and mutual translatability of the methods: here N Guicciardini (2003) appears to confirm L'H√¥pital (1696) (already cited): References in fiction The calculus controversy is a major topic in Neal Stephenson's set of historical novels The Baroque Cycle (2003-04). The antagonistic nature of the dispute plays a role in Greg Keyes' steampunk alternate history series The Age of Unreason. Briefly mentioned by Walter Bishop in the Season 1 episode of Fringe, entitled \\"The Equation\\". The controversy is referenced in the Season 3 entry of Epic Rap Battles of History featuring Isaac Newton (portrayed by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic) performing a rap battle against Bill Nye (Nice Peter) and Neil deGrasse Tyson (Chali 2na). Tyson delivers a rap line stating that Newton was busy \\"sticking daggers in Leibniz\\". In an episode of The Big Bang Theory, Leonard is accused of not wanting the bust of Isaac Newton at the top of the Christmas tree by Sheldon, saying it is because he is a Leibniz man.

He was made a baron and premier peintre de la reine (First Painter to the Queen), and drew the last portrait ever made of Louis XVI before the king's execution. His less formal portraits reflect his fascination with physiognomy and show an interest in expanding the range of facial expressions beyond those of conventional portraiture. Life and career Marie Antoinette, in 1769; this portrait was sent to the Dauphin of France, Louis-Auguste, so he could see his bride before he met her. Born in Nancy, France, Ducreux may have trained with his father, who was also a painter. When Ducreux went to Paris in 1760, he trained as the only student of the pastelist Maurice Quentin de La Tour, who specialized in portraiture. Jean-Baptiste Greuze was an important influence on Ducreux's oil technique. In 1769, Ducreux was sent to Vienna in order to paint a miniature of Marie Antoinette (shown left) before she left the city in 1770 and married Louis XVI of France. Ducreux was made a baron and premier peintre de la reine (First Painter to the Queen) in rewards for his services. Ducreux was given this appointment by Marie-Antoinette even though he was not a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which had been founded in 1648. The academy was strictly hierarchical and the posts of first painter, ordinary painter and inspector or inspector general of royal factories were customarily reserved for members of the academy. At the outbreak of the French Revolution, Ducreux traveled to London. There he drew the last portrait ever made of Louis XVI before the king's execution. Jacques-Louis David became one of Ducreux's associates when the latter returned to Paris in 1793. David helped Ducreux continue an official career. Ducreux's residence became an informal salon for artists and musicians, who commissioned portraits from him. One of these musicians was his friend √âtienne M√©hul, who is said to have based the main character of one of his operas on Ducreux. Ducreux had several children. His eldest son Jules was a painter and infantry captain who died in the Battle of Jemappes; several of his paintings still exist. His other sons died young. His eldest daughter, Rose-Ad√©la√Øde Ducreux, also became a painter, as it is said did his daughter Antoinette-Cl√©mence.Profile of Antoinette-Cl√©mence Ducreux at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800. Work Self-portrait, yawning, ca. 1783 Ducreux specialized in portrait painting. He completed his early portraits in pastel, including those of connoisseurs Pierre-Jean Mariette, the Comte de Caylus and Ange-Laurent de la Live de July. These works may have been copies after De La Tour. Although Ducreux cataloged his works in list form from 1760 onward, he rarely signed his paintings. Thus, many of his works remain erroneously attributed to other artists. Other portraits by Ducreux include those of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos and Maria Theresa of Austria, as well as those mentioned above of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Ducreux also made several well-known self-portraits in the 1780s and 1790s, including one in 1783 in which he painted himself in the middle of a large yawn (the Getty Center, Los Angeles). In another, Portrait de l'artiste sous les traits d'un moqueur (c. 1793, Louvre), the artist guffaws and points at the viewer. This self-portrait has gained widespread recognition in recent years as an Internet image macro. With these self-portraits Ducreux attempted to break free from the constraints of traditional portraiture. His interest in physiognomy‚Äîthe belief that a person's outer appearance, especially the shape and lines of their face, could reveal their inner character‚Äîinfluenced him in creating his warm and individualistic works. For example, his portrait Le Discret (ca. 1790) depicts a man with a timorous facial expression requesting silence by pressing his finger against his mouth, gesturing by which he appears to be demanding discretion or prudence. Through unusual body language and physical appearances, these portraits parallel the vivacious tronies of Dutch Golden Age painting and the \\"character heads\\" of contemporary Austrian sculptor Franz Xaver Messerschmidt (1736‚Äì1783), some of whose busts were self-portraits with extreme expressions. Internet meme Ducreux's self-portrait Portrait de l'artiste sous les traits d'un moqueur (shown below) has become subject to internet popularity as part of an internet meme. In the meme, rap and pop song lyrics, common internet phrases, and similar tropes are paraphrased in verbose, stilted, or faux-archaic English and overlaid on top of the portrait to create an image macro.

It was mainly used as a fleet vehicle for companies such as electric utilities. Only about 200 vehicles were ever produced. It used the bodystyle of the Nissan R'nessa. Technologically, the Altra was significant as being the first production electric vehicle to use a lithium-ion battery (li-ion) battery. Nissan called this a third-generation battery (after lead‚Äìacid and nickel‚Äìmetal hydride) and chose li-ion primarily for its power density. It was managed by a passive system, ensuring the batteries never reach charge levels outside their recommended zones. The Altra had a permanent magnet synchronous motor, controlled by a 32-bit RISC computer. It had other more typical features, such as keyless entry, power mirrors and windows, a 4-wheel anti-lock braking system, and regenerative braking. According to Nissan, the Altra had a maximum range of . The Environmental Protection Agency reported that the 2000 version had an adjusted mileage (miles per equivalent of a gasoline gallon) of the city, and on the highway.

It called for the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Beirut and provided a framework for the establishment of normal bilateral relations between the two countries. Lebanon was under both Israeli and Syrian military occupations during its negotiation.  Political background  The agreement was signed on May 17, 1983 by Mr. William Drapper for the United States, Mr. David Kimche for Israel and Mr. Antoine Fattal for Lebanon. Lebanese President Amine Gemayel had recently been elected after the assassination of his brother President-elect Bachir Gemayel, a longtime ally of Israel, by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Some Lebanese backed President Amin Gemayel, arguing that its close relations to the US could help create peace and restore Lebanese sovereignty, which they saw as threatened not only by the Israeli occupation but also by the Syrian occupation.  Terms of the agreement  The agreement terminated the state of war between Israel and Lebanon that had lasted since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and provided for a staged withdrawal of Israeli forces, on the condition of the establishment of a Lebanese Army \\"security zone\\" in South Lebanon along the border area. It contained numerous clauses detailing security cooperation between Lebanon and Israel designed to prevent the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other groups from infiltrating the border areas.Text of the agreement  Collapse of the agreement  The agreement called for the Lebanese Army to take over Israeli positions. The confessionalist government of Lebanon collapsed on 6 February 1984 under the weight of a mounting civil war in Beirut from rival sectarian factions and Lebanon could not keep its side of the agreement. The agreement was revoked by the Lebanese parliament under the leadership of newly-elected speaker Hussein el-Husseini, who replaced speaker Kamel Asaad who had supported the agreement. The agreement met strong opposition from Lebanese Muslims and in the Arab world, and it was portrayed as an imposed surrender. The conclusion of separate peace with Israel was (and is) a taboo subject in the Arab world, and Egypt's peace agreement at Camp David had left the country ostracized and temporarily expelled from the Arab League. Syria's opposition to the agreement was vocal, and by refusing to move its troops from Lebanese soil, Damascus effectively torpedoed its implementation, since Israeli withdrawal was contingent on Syria doing the same. As a result, the Lebanese government repudiated the agreement on March 5, 1984.Statement by the Israeli Prime Minister's bureau on the Israel-Lebanon Agreement, 5 March 1984 Israel insisted on the treaty's implementation, and threatened that it would impose its terms with or without Lebanese consent, but Lebanese public opinion protested ‚Äî and more importantly, the fragile civil war peace process started to unravel.  Later developments  In 2000, Israel withdrew from its foothold in South Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had pledged to pull out of Southern Lebanon as part of his election campaign, though it is widely believed that he did so due to a belief that he would be able to make peace with Syria before the evacuation, thereby removing an obstacle to Israeli-Lebanese peace. When peace talks between Israel and Syria broke down over the nature of a withdrawal on the Golan Heights, Barak decided to pull out without an agreement, causing many, especially in the Arab world, to view this as a victory for Hezbollah, which had been waging a long guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces. As a result, Lebanon and Israel formally remain at war, and Lebanon officially refuses to recognize Israel as a state. = Shebaa farms = Whereas a cease-fire is in effect along most of the border, which is mostly calm except for continual Israeli aerial overflights and infrequent skirmishes, Lebanon considers the Shebaa Farms area of the Golan Heights, to be under continued Israeli occupation. Hezbollah refers to this as a reason for continued armed resistance, and occasionally stages raids into this area; Israel responds with shelling and counter-raids in the Shebaa Farms or on other points along the border. These exchanges occasionally produces a flare-up in fighting. The United Nations has recognized Israel as having fully disengaged from Lebanon, thus opposing the Lebanese demands for the Shebaa. The U.N., like Israel, instead considers the Shebaa Farms to be part of Syria's Golan Heights, currently under Israeli occupation, pending a future peace deal. The Syrian position on this remains somewhat complicated: the Syrian government backs the Lebanese demands for the Shebaa, but refuses to provide maps documenting Lebanese ownership of the area. In 2005, the Syrian government reportedly considered formally ceding the Shebaa Farms to Lebanon, but no such action was taken. In early 2006, after the so-called Cedar Revolution, parts of the Lebanese anti-Syrian block - such as Druze leader Walid Jumblatt ‚Äî started officially questioning Lebanon's demands for the Shebaa. He argued that the area is in fact Syrian, and that this issue is used by Syria and Hezbollah as a pretext for the latter to maintain its status as an armed resistance organization outside the Lebanese Army. This led to heated debate, with Jumblatt opposed by Hezbollah, Amal and other pro-Syrian Lebanese groups, while other parties tried to find a middle ground.

Atkinson was the 34th Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly in the Jay Weatherill government from 2013 to 2018. Before this post, he was the 46th Attorney-General of South Australia, Minister for Justice, Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and Minister for Multicultural Affairs in the Mike Rann Labor Government. A day after the 2010 election, he stepped down as Attorney-General and resigned from the Cabinet. Atkinson represented the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Croydon from the seat's creation in 2002 until 2018, and previously Spence from 1989 until the seat was abolished and replaced by Croydon in 2002. He was a member of the Australian Journalists Association whilst working for the Adelaide Advertiser. He is currently a member of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association. Early life Atkinson attended Glenelg Primary School and Unley High School. He then studied at the Australian National University and received a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) degree in history and also a Bachelor of Laws degree. He worked as a sub-editor and journalist for the Adelaide Advertiser from 1982 to 1985, an adviser and press secretary to federal minister Chris Hurford from 1985 to 1987, before becoming an advocate for the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) in 1989. Parliamentary career A founding member of the Labor Right faction, Atkinson was first elected to Parliament at the 1989 election. Following the 1993 election, he was shadow minister in a range of portfolios until Labor won government at the 2002 election. He subsequently became Attorney-General, Minister for Justice, Minister for Consumer Affairs and Minister for Multicultural Affairs in the Rann cabinet. In a minor cabinet reshuffle in 2004, Atkinson lost his portfolio of Consumer Affairs. He became Minister for Correctional Services in 2006. Atkinson earlier in his political career. He was re-elected at the 2006 election landslide in his seat of Croydon with a 76 percent two-party vote from a 6.9 percent two-party swing toward him. At the 2010 election Atkinson was again re-elected, but with a 12 percent two-party swing against him, significantly higher than the statewide 8.4 percent two- party swing. Following his re-election, he announced he would resign from the Rann ministry but remain on the backbench. Atkinson was re-elected at the 2014 election where he picked up a 3.5 percent two-party swing toward him. On 5 February 2013 Atkinson replaced Lyn Breuer as Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly. In September 2016, Peter Malinauskas moved house and into Atkinson's electorate of Croydon. He said of Atkinson: \\"Mick [Atkinson] knows the movements of every single one of his constituents ‚Äì I suspect I‚Äôm no exception.‚Äù Atkinson announced in February 2017 that he would be retiring from parliament as of the 2018 election.State Labor MPs Michael Atkinson, Jennifer Rankine and Steph Key quitting politics at next election: The Advertiser 3 February 2017 Political views =Media classification and censorship= Atkinson had blocked several attempts to introduce a R18+ for video games in Australia. In a letter on the subject, Atkinson stated, \\"I don't support the introduction of an R18+ rating for electronic games, chiefly because it will greatly increase the risk of children and vulnerable adults being exposed to damaging images and messages.\\" He also withdrew his support for a discussion paper released for public consultation on the subject of an R18+ rating. Unanimity from Atkinson and his fellow state and federal Attorneys-General is required for the introduction of the rating (or a change to that requirement). Australia's rating system lacked a classification for games above MA15+ at the time. It therefore lacked not only an equivalent rating to the ESRB's AO (adults only) rating but also an equivalent to its Mature (17+) rating. After Atkinson stepped down as Attorney-General in 2010, an R18+ rating for video games in Australia was eventually implemented in 2013. In 2009, Atkinson, in his role as attorney-general of South Australia, introduced laws into parliament that made internet commentary on the upcoming 2010 election illegal unless the commenter provided their real name and postcode. The laws were passed, and came into effect on 6 January 2010. Following public criticism, Atkinson later promised to repeal the section following the 2010 South Australian election and indicated it would not be enforced during the electoral period. =Victims' rights= In 2008, Atkinson introduced legislation aimed at increasing the rights of victims of crime. The legislation purported to allow victims to suggest a suitable sentence for the offender and made it compulsory for judges to consider imposing a restraining order on convicted sex offenders. = Casting votes = Since accepting his role as speaker, Atkinson has used his casting vote in Parliament to oppose several bills presented during the Weatherill government.

The Baffin was designed by Major F A Bumpus to meet a Fleet Air Arm requirement as a conventional two-seat single-bay biplane of mixed metal and wooden construction with fabric covering. It had swept, staggered, equal-span wings, the lower having an inverse gull to provide clearance for the torpedo while retaining a short undercarriage. Armament comprised one fixed, forward-firing 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun and one free-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun in the rear cockpit, plus one 2,000 lb (910 kg) bomb, or 1,576 lb (716 kg) Mk VIII or Mk IX torpedo, or three 530 lb (240 kg) or six 250 lb (110 kg) bombs. Development In the early 1930s the torpedo bomber squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm were equipped with the Blackburn Ripon. While the Ripon had only entered service in 1930, it was powered by the elderly water-cooled Napier Lion engine, and it was realised that replacing the Lion with a modern air-cooled radial engine would increase payload and simplify maintenance. In 1932 Blackburn decided to build two prototypes of radial-engined Ripons, one powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Tiger and the second by a Bristol Pegasus, as a private venture (i.e. without an order from the Air Ministry).Mason 1994, p. 239.Jackson 1968, pp. 349‚Äì350. The Pegasus-engined prototype first flew on 30 September 1932, and after testing was chosen in preference to the Tiger- powered aircraft as a short-term replacement for the Ripon. Initial orders were placed for 26 newly built aircraft and 38 conversions of Ripon airframes, production beginning in 1933. A further 26 conversions of Ripons into Baffins were ordered in 1935 because of reliability problems associated with the Armstrong Siddeley Tiger engines powering Blackburn Sharks, and the desire to expand the strength of the Fleet Air Arm.Jackson 1968, pp. 350‚Äì352. An additional three new production Baffins had the 580 hp (430 kW) Pegasus II.M3 engine and were termed the Baffin T8A. The aircraft is said to have inspired the coining of the word \\"Boffin\\". Service Baffins flying over HMS Furious circa 1936. Two prototypes and 33 production Baffins went to a training flight at Gosport for dummy deck-landing and torpedo practice, with the first Squadron re-equipping with the Baffin No 812 Squadron, in January 1934. The type went to sea with 810 Squadron on , 811 on , 812 on and and 820 Squadron on Courageous. In addition, 14 were sent to Malta to serve on carriers in the Mediterranean. The Baffin served barely two years before being replaced by the Shark and Fairey Swordfish, with 812 Squadron continuing to fly Baffins until December 1936. All British aircraft appear to have been withdrawn from service before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1937, New Zealand acquired 29 of the best-condition Baffins from the UK to equip Territorial Air Force (reserve) squadrons in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Twenty-four were operational on the outbreak of war, 16 in Wellington and eight in Christchurch. At the outbreak of war, these aircraft were utilised as trainers. With the realisation of the threat posed by surface raiders, the RNZAF Baffin was returned to the active list, the survivors being merged in March 1940 as the NZ General Reconnaissance Squadron, renamed 1 GR Squadron in 1941 when half the strength was transferred to 3 GR Squadron. The Baffins were replaced by Lockheed Hudsons before the outbreak of war with Japan; the last Baffins were broken up at Rongotai in 1941.

Barnes & Noble acquired the chain from Dayton's in 1987 and continued to operate it until a late 2009 announcement that the last 50 stores would be liquidated by January 2010. History Bruce Dayton, a member of the family that operated Dayton's, a department store chain based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, founded the B. Dalton chain in 1966. He named the bookstore chain after himself, but substituted an L for the Y in his surname. The name B. Dalton was also chosen because it \\"connoted quality, dependability and authority.\\" The first store opened in nearby Edina in August of that year, followed by a second in St. Louis, Missouri. Although the chain was originally intended to operate in downtowns and suburban areas, the majority of the stores were opened inside regional shopping malls. In 1969, Dayton's merged with Hudson's of Detroit and became Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation). B. Dalton expanded throughout the 1960s and 1970s, going from twelve stores in 1968 to 125 five years later, peaking at 798 locations in 1986. In 1968, the chain acquired Pickwick Books of California; they merged in 1979. B. Dalton had stores in 43 of 50 states in 1978, and was second to Waldenbooks (then the U.S.'s largest bookstore) in store numbers, but posted higher profits than its rival.

Under Barnes & Noble's ownership, B. Dalton acquired Scribner Book Stores, Inc. from Rizzoli International Bookstores in 1989,Scribner Chronology and began a video game store called Software, Etc. (now GameStop). At the same time, the chain began closing outlets and relocating others, while opening other prototypes. By 1997, the chain had shrunk to 528 locations, and continued to close many more over the next decade. In January 2010, Barnes & Noble closed the last 50 B.

In 1996, NeoStar Retail Group Inc., then owner of Software Etc. and Babbage's, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put the two chains up for sale. By November, NeoStar had failed to find a buyer and announced that all 707 stores owned by the company would close in the next year. By November 26, the plan to close the stores was halted, as NeoStar's assets were sold to an investor group led by retailer Leonard Riggio.

Historians generally ascribe to him the Letters of Centinel written under the pseudonym Centinel between 1787 and 1789. Centinel attacked the proposed Constitution of the United States as a document in the interests of the \\"well-born few\\". He was the son of George Bryan, a judge on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the principal Anti-Federalist in the state, to whom the essays were frequently attributed at the time they were written.Storing, Herbert J., ed. The Complete Anti-Federalist. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1969. Centinel wrote three series of essays. The first eighteen numbers appeared in late 1787 and early 1788, and reflected the Anti-Federalist opposition to the Constitution. Letters XIX through XXIV were produced toward the end of 1788. By this time, the Constitution had been adopted, and these essays sought to sway the election of representatives to the new government.

Convict buildings at the former jail on Norfolk Island where Kavenagh spent the last years of his life. Cash & Co On 26 December 1842 Lawrence Kavenagh, Martin Cash and George Jones absconded from a work party. Hiding in dense scrubland and with little food they made their way 15 km to the neck. Swimming with their clothes tied in bundles above their heads, they made it to the other side but all three of them lost their bundles. Now naked, the trio robbed a road gang's hut for clothing, and began a seven month spree of bushranging and robbing mail coaches, homesteads and inns. In July 1843, the Government offered 'one hundred acres of land or one hundred sovereigns, in addition to the reward of fifty sovereigns, free pardon, and passage from the colony, for the apprehension of' Cash, Jones and Kavenagh. On 10 July 1843 Kavenagh gave himself up after wounding himself that morning, at Lake Sorell, by the accidental discharge of his own gun while getting over a log. He claimed he walked 28 miles to Bothwell in great pain when he surrendered. He had shot himself in the arm.

History The Seigniory of Longueuil was first granted in 1657 to Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Ch√¢teauguay, Sieur de Longueuil, and was raised to the label of Barony of Longueuil in 1700 by Louis XIV in recognition of Le Moyne's services. By 1710 the Barony had expanded to include land from the St Lawrence River to the Richelieu River and south along the west bank of the river to the Seigniory of DeL√©ry. Charles le Moyne was killed in action near Saratoga, New York in 1729, and the barony passed to his son, also named Charles le Moyne (1687‚Äì1755), the third baron, who was killed during the Seven Years' War. The third baron's widow, Marie-Anne-Catherine Fleury Deschambault, married William Grant in 1770, the son of the Laird of Blairfindy, Moray, Scotland. The Barony was to be inherited by her daughter, Marie-Charles-Joseph Le Mote de Longeuil, and Grant arranged a marriage to his nephew, Captain David Alexander Grant of the British 94th Regiment. The couple were wed in 1781 and their eldest son became the fifth Baron de Longueuil in 1841. At one point the Barony included an area of about , and as the population of the area increased much of it was sold into freehold. When the seigneurial system was abolished in 1854 what had not been sold was entailed. Although dissolved, the Barony of Longueuil continued to receive seigneurial revenues until 1969. After the conquest of New France, the descendants of Charles le Moyne maintained that, since Britain had promised to respect the ancient land tenures, it was obliged to recognize Longueuil as a barony. It was not until 1880, however, that a formal request for recognition was made to Queen Victoria. The matter was submitted to the law officers of the crown, who ruled the claim to be well grounded and the rank and title of Charles Colmore Grant, seventh Baron de Longueuil, were formally recognized by royal proclamation, the royal recognition being officially announced as follows: The Queen has been graciously pleased to recognize the right of Charles Colmore Grant, Esquire, to the title of Baron de Longueuil, of Longueuil, in the province of Quebec, Canada. This title was conferred on his ancestor, Charles Le Moyne, by letters-patent of nobility signed by King Louis XIV in the year 1700. On 10 May 2004, the city of Longueuil in the province of Quebec was granted arms by the Canadian Heraldic Authority based on the arms granted by King Louis XIV in 1668 to the original Charles le Moyne, sieur de Longueuil, in the presence of the Lieutenant- Governor of Quebec and the late Raymond Grant, 11th Baron de Longueuil. =Letters patent= The original letters patent issued by Louis XIV are titled as follows: :\\"Erection en baronnie de la seigneurie de Longueuil en faveur de Charles Lemoyne de Longueuil\\" donn√© √† Versailles, le vingt-sixi√®me du mois de janvier, l'an de gr√¢ce mil sept cent, et de notre r√®gne, la cinquante-septi√®me ‚Äì sign√© Louis :(\\"Elevation to the rank of barony of the seigniory of Longueuil in favour of Charles Lemoyne of Longueuil\\" given at Versailles, the 26 January, in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred, and the fifty-seventh year of our reign ‚Äì signed Louis) An extract, providing for the devolution of the title, reads as follows: :\\"A ces causes, de notre gr√¢ce sp√©ciale, pleine puissance et autorit√© royalle, nous avons cr√©√©, √©rig√©, √©lev√© et d√©cor√©, cr√©ons, √©rigeons et d√©corons par ces pr√©sentes sign√©es de notre main, la dite terre et seigneurie de Longueuil, scitu√©e en notre pays de Canada, en titre, nom et dignit√© de baronnie pour en jouir par le dit Sieur Charles Le Moyne, ses enfants, successeurs, ayant cause, et les descendants d'iceux en l√©gitime mariage, plainement et paisiblement, relevant de nous √† cause de nostre couronne...\\" :(\\"For these reasons, we, of our peculiar grace, absolute power and royal authority, have created, established, exalted and decorated, and do by these presents signed with our hand create, establish and decorate, the said land and seigniory of Longueuil, situate in our country of Canada, with the title, name and dignity of a barony for the enjoyment of the said Sieur Charles Le Moyne, his children and successors according to law, and the descendants of the same born in lawful wedlock, in full and peaceable subjection to us by right of our crown...\\" List of the Barons de Longueuil *1700‚Äì1729 Charles II le Moyne, 1st Baron de Longueuil *1729‚Äì1755 Charles III le Moyne, 2nd Baron de Longueuil *1755-1755 Charles-Jacques le Moyne, 3rd Baron de Longueuil *1755‚Äì1841 Marie-Charles le Moyne, 4th Baroness de Longueuil *1841‚Äì1848 Charles William Grant, 5th Baron de Longueuil *1848‚Äì1879 Charles James Irwin Grant, 6th Baron de Longueuil *1879‚Äì1898 Charles Colmore Grant, 7th Baron de Longueuil *1898‚Äì1931 Reginald Charles Grant, 8th Baron de Longueuil *1931‚Äì1938 John Charles Moore Grant, 9th Baron de Longueuil *1938‚Äì1959 Ronald Charles Grant, 10th Baron de Longueuil *1959‚Äì2004 Raymond Grant, 11th Baron de Longueuil *2004‚Äìpresent Michael Grant, 12th Baron de Longueuil See also * Canadian Hereditary Peers * Canadian titles debate Notes External links *Portrait of Charles le Moyne du Longueuil, 3rd Baron du Longueuil, 1724‚Äì1755 at the McCord Museum *Soci√©t√© d'histoire de Longueuil ‚Äì Ressources et documentation *Michel Pratt √âdition r√©vis√©e et augment√©e, 30 mai 2005, Dictionnaire historique de Longueuil, de Jacques- Cartier et de Montr√©al-Sud. at: https://web.archive.org/web/20100407054725/http://marigot.ca/dictio/longueuil/g.html Category:Le Moyne family ","title":"Baron de Longueuil"},{"id":"3671883","title":"Anthony Ricketts"},{"id":"3671884","text":"Amirim (, lit.

History Early attempts by Moroccan Jewish immigrants from Morocco to establish a settlement in the 1950s were not successful. The original name was Shefa Bet. In 1958, a group of people of various backgrounds banded together to create a moshav based on a vegetarian, vegan, and organic lifestyle and ideology. The founders of Amirim were among the pioneers of the vegetarian movement in Israel.Israel News : Jerusalem Post Internet Edition A group of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist families under the leadership of Ben and Lois Roden moved to Amirim in 1958 and established \\"The Branch Organic Agricultural Association,\\" which encouraged organic agriculture. They had difficult in cooperating with the requirements of the moshav, however, causing friction with other residents, and the group soon moved to Jerusalem.  Spiritual Orientation  Amirim is mostly a secular Jewish community, but there are some religious Jewish vegetarian families who live there. Its residents have been described as \\"spiritually oriented\\". Tourism One of the moshav's main sources of income is tourism. The moshav runs guesthouses and restaurants featuring vegetarian and vegan food. In the early 1960s, the Jewish Agency helped 10 families build the first zimmerim, as the guest chalets are known. The moshav has a sculpture garden which displays 20 statues belonging to the Israel Museum collections. The works are made by Israeli and international artists, including a steel statue by David Palombo.  Arts  The moshav has been noted for its sculpture garden, which features sculptures donated by the Israel Museum, as well as for its music.

It was ordered in 1913 but did not fly until 27 November 1916 when it became the first British rigid airship to do so. It was dismantled in June 1918 after being flown for around 165 hours, mainly for experimental purposes.Higham 1961, p. 131 Background Plans to build a second rigid airship to follow the unsuccessful HMA No. 1 (His Majesty's Airship No. 1) Mayfly were agreed by the Committee for Imperial Defence in early 1913,Higham 1961, p. 65 and that Vickers should be asked to design an improved class of ship incorporating all that was then known about the Zeppelins. Vickers' airship design department had been disbanded following the failure of the Mayfly, consequently a new department was formed when the original design team was reassembled with H. B. Pratt recruited as chief designer. Pratt had been working at Vickers while the Mayfly was being constructed and had predicted that it was not structurally sound and subsequently left the company. Pratt in turn hired Barnes Wallis, whom he had met while both were working for the shipbuilding firm of J. Samuel White, as his assistant.Higham 1961, p.125 The initial order for the new ship was placed on 10 June 1913, with the final plans being agreed at the end of the year, and a formal contract was signed in March 1914. Design The initial specification called for an airship with a disposable lift of 5 tons (5080 kg) capable of flying at and maintaining an altitude of for 30 minutes; however, the required load was later reduced to 3.1 tons (3150 kg).Higham 1961 p. 130 The hull was cylindrical for most of its length and was constructed from 17-sided transverse frames with a triangular section keel underneath. Two gondolas were suspended from the keel, the forward one containing the control compartment and two of the engines, the aft containing an emergency control station and the remaining pair of engines. In addition there was a radio cabin and a mess space for the crew within the keel structure, which also contained the fuel and ballast tanks. Propulsion was provided by four Wolseley engines, mounted in pairs in the gondolas. Like Mayfly, it was designed with watertight cars so that it could be operated from water. The design was based in part on French plans of Z IV which had landed in France on 3 April 1913 following an accidental incursion into French airspace, permitting a thorough examination.Higham 1961, p. 124 Construction was delayed by a number of circumstances. Difficulties were encountered with the fabrication of the duralumin girders for the transverse frames, and there were many changes to the design, including strengthening the hull so that it could be handled safely by inexperienced crews, and replacing the original drive arrangement of paired propellers mounted on the sides of the hull with swivelling propellers mounted on the gondolas (as used on contemporary British Army dirigibles). Construction The construction shed at the Cavendish Dock at Barrow was too small for the new design so a new hangar was built at Walney Island, off the west of Barrow. The new shed was long, wide and high, and had a -thick concrete floor with handling rails embedded into it which extended into the adjacent field. As a safety measure the shed had eight fire extinguishing jets fed by a dedicated reservoir. A gasbag factory employing 100 staff was also set up beside the shed.Higham 1961, p. 126 When World War I broke out on 4 August 1914 No.9r was nearly ready for erection, and despite competing demands for materials and manpower for other projects, construction continued during the first months of the war. However, there was a feeling that the project was no longer favoured by the Admiralty: Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty was known to be unenthusiastic about airships, and on 12 March 1915 he cancelled the order for the ship. The reasons given for this decision were that it was expected that the war would be finished in 1915, and that the vessel would not be operational by then and thus was a waste of valuable resources. On 19 June 1915, after Churchill had been replaced as First Lord by Arthur Balfour, a conference was held at the Admiralty to consider all airship development. At that time the non-rigid airship programme was proving to be successful, and at this meeting it was agreed to expand the non-rigid programme and also to resume construction of HMA No.9. However, resumption of work was delayed by the necessity to retrieve Pratt and Wallis who had enlisted in the Army when construction was cancelled.Higham 1961, p. 128 Final erection of the ship began in the autumn of that year, but there were delays in obtaining flax from Ireland to make nets for the gasbags following the Easter Rising, and the ship was not completed until 28 June 1916. Operational history On 16 November 1916, No. 9r left its shed and was moored outside for tests of the fittings and engines, the first test flight taking place on 27 November 1916. This was the first time a British rigid airship had flown; however, it was unable to lift the contract weight of 3.1 tons. It was therefore lightened by the removal of both rear engines, replacing them with a single engine that had been salvaged from the Zeppelin L 33 which had made a forced landing in Little Wigborough, Essex, on 24 September 1916. New, lighter, gasbags were also fitted. These modifications increased the disposable lift to 3.8 tons (3861 kg), and it was accepted by the Navy in April 1917.Higham 1916, p. 347-8 No.9r was then sent to the RNAS airship station at Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire where it spent most of the time being used for experimental mooring and handling tests. From 17 October 1917 to June 1918 it was stationed at RNAS Pulham in Norfolk where it was finally dismantled due to demand for shed space to allow construction of newer airships, having spent 198 hours and 16 minutes in the air, of which some 33 hours were at a mooring mast. Although unable to compete against contemporary Zeppelins, No.9r provided valuable experience of handling a rigid airship and the use of mooring masts, which would evolve into a unique method of mooring airships.

From the 1st century BC the Bay of Naples witnessed the rise of villas constructed by elite Romans along the most panoramic points of the coast, who had chosen the area as a favourite vacation spot. The remains of some of these as well as the Seiano tunnel can be seen today in the Parco archeologico del Pausilypon, or Posillipo Archaeological Park, and elsewhere. Geography Archaeological Park on Cape Posillipo Posillipo is a rocky peninsula about 6 km long surrounded by cliffs with a few small coves with breakwaters at the western end of the Bay of Naples. These small harbours are the nuclei for separate, named communities such as Gaiola Island and Marechiaro. History Posillipo is mentioned in ancient Greek and Roman sources and the Greeks first named it Paus√≠lypon, meaning \\"respite from worry\\". The French Homeric scholar Victor B√©rard; identified Posillipo as the land of Homer's Cyclopes. From the 1st century BC the beautiful coastline of Campania attracted wealthy Romans as a place to build elaborate and grand villas as retreats. At Posillipo the most visible ruins are those of the famous and notorious villa of Vedius Pollio, later to become an Imperial Villa. The villa was described by the poet Ovid as \\"like a city\\".Ovid, Fasti 6.641 Most notoriously, he kept a pool of lampreys into which slaves who incurred his displeasure would be thrown as food,Dio 52.23.2Seneca the Younger, On Clemency 1.18.2Pliny the Elder, Natural History 9.39 a particularly unpleasant means of death, since the lamprey \\"clamps its mouth on the victim and bores a dentated tongue into the flesh to ingest blood\\".Africa, p. 71, citing M. W. Hardisty; I. C. Potter (1971). The Biology of Lampreys. New York. pp. vol. I, pp. 147-161\\\\. . However, the emperor, Augustus, on visiting Pollio and witnessing the condemnation of a slave, took action against Pollio and saved the slave, an incident widely documented in writings of the era (see Vedius Pollio for more details). Vedius died in 15 BC and was probably forced to bequeath a large part of his estates, including the villa, to the emperor Augustus. Although Augustus had Vedius' mansion in Rome razed, Posillipo was rebuilt and extended to become a palace, which remained in imperial possession at least until the time of Hadrian. Villa Donn'Anna Villa Vedius Pollio In the 17th century the property of the site of the imperial villa passed to the family Maza who, for several generations, showed an interest in archaeology and Francesco Maria Maza (circ. 1680) was the author of inscriptions which he affixed to the so-called 'Piscine of V.Pollio' and to the 'Temple of Fortune' which were in situ as late as 1913. However the Maza collection was dispersed and the loss to archaeological science was irreparable as a catalogue had never been prepared. Several objects of art from Posillipan sites found their way into the hands of Spanish collectors, and are still no doubt among the Roman antiquities in Spain. Many fine pieces were taken to Mergellina and lost among the other ornaments of the villa of the Duke of Medina. In 1820 the southern portion of the property was purchased by a well-known Neapolitan archaeologist, Cavaliere Guglielmo Bechi, and his name was associated with the Villa for more than half a century. He did much excavation, but again without publication of results. In 1841 more methodical excavations were begun on the adjoining property to the west of the ancient lane that led down the valley from the Seiano cave to the sea. The principal buildings of that part of the Villa were soon brought to light; the Theatre, an Odeon, and the remains of a Portico overlooking the sea. An oblong building called the Temple was also found and the remains of an aqueduct. In about 1870 the Marchese del Tufo opened a quarry for pozzolana clearing away the central part of what had been a broad continuous terrace along the south front of the property in Roman times. The buildings that stood on the hillside above the terrace, including the southern part of the baths, fell down the slope into the sea. Roman Monuments The Archaeological Park is one of the most beautiful places in the city and along the coast of Posillipo. Access for visitors is currently through the Seiano tunnel. Among the most important sites are the Seiano cave, the underwater park of Gaiola, the imperial villa of Pausilypon (including the Odeon, theatre) and the Palace of the Spirits. =Imperial Villa= Fragment of fresco, Villa of Vedius Pollio, Ashmolean museum The ruins of the Roman villa of Vedius Pollio, also known as the Imperial Villa, include a 2000-seat theatre on the rocky promontory at the end of the Bay of Naples. Some of the villa's rooms can be seen with traces of the wall decorations while its marine structures and fish ponds are now part of the neighbouring submerged Gaiola Park. The villa was built in the first century BC by Publius Vedius Pollio. On his death in 15 BC, the villa was bequeathed to Augustus, and remained in imperial possession for his successors at least until Hadrian, as witnessed by a stamped water pipe. In various points the presence of water supply pipes (coated with hydraulic mortar) show the opulence of the facilities. Nereid on sea monster, early 1st c. AD, from the villa of Vedius Pollio, Naples Archaeology Museum The submerged parts of the ruins of the imperial villa and the rich and diverse marine and coastal natural environment can be seen via boat excursions. The George Vallet Archaeological museum in Sorrento has a model of the villa. =Seiano tunnel= Roman Seiano tunnel western end Seiano tunnel eastern end The extraordinary 770 metre-long tunnel of the \\"Seiano cave\\" passes beneath the Posillipo hill and connected the imperial villa and other patrician villas nearby with the Phlegrean Fields and the towns and ports of Puteoli and Cumae. It owes its name to Lucius Aelius Seianus, prefect of Tiberius, who according to tradition commissioned its enlargement in the first century AD; the first tunnel was built 50 years earlier by architect Lucius Cocceius Auctus at the behest of Agrippa. The eastern entrance is cut into the rock cliff within the archaeological park while the western entrance was a monumental arch with opus reticulatum lining the cliff sides, and both ends being of about 14 m height. The height, width and length of the tunnel made it a great engineering achievement and an extravagant one considering it served only a small population. An enormous volume of rock alone had to be removed though some served as building material for the villas. The tunnelling was complicated by the alternation of pozzolanic earth with tufa necessitating the elaborate lining of most of the tunnel with stonework of opus reticulatum and then with vaulting on top of these walls. Work progressed at 5‚Äì7 m per day as indicated by the joints between sections. It was not perfectly straight in plan but included small deviations near the centre where the tunnellers from each end met after remarkably small inaccuracies of alignment given the techniques of the time. It had three secondary side tunnels ending in openings overhanging the bay to provide light and ventilation. Although known about by scholars (for example it is referred to in the Polish writer Adam Mickiewicz's epic 'Pan Tadeusz' published in 1834), it had fallen into disuse over the centuries. it was rediscovered during works for a new road in 1841 and immediately brought to light and made passable by Ferdinand II of Bourbon, becoming a tourist destination. Additional lining and arches were built to repair and reinforce the ancient walls. During the Second World War it was used as an air raid shelter for the inhabitants of Bagnoli; the war and landslides during the 1950s took it back to a state of neglect since when it was restored. =Other Sights= Palace of the Spirits The remains of other Roman houses can be seen in Marechiaro along the beach, or at Calata Ponticello where there is an Ionic column base and a brick niche. On the cliff towards Gaiola are the remains of the \\"House of the Spirits\\" also called \\"Villarosa\\" which was the nymphaeum of the villa and also built in the first century BC. Further along the coast to the west is the perimeter of the \\"Virgil School\\" where it was believed that the \\"prophet\\" practiced magical arts. The grandeur and luxury of these villas are documented in the George Vallet Archaeological museum. The Roman aqueduct supplying the coastal villas was a branch of the Serino or Aqua Augusta (Naples) and was discovered in 1882 when the Grotta Nuova di Posilipo was made for a tramway through the hill. Ancient inscriptions found inside the tunnel verify that it fed the villa of Felix Pollio, among others, mainly intended for the nymphaeum and the baths. Modern Developments The area remained largely undeveloped until a road, via Posillipo, was built between 1812 and 1824. That road starts at sea level at the Mergellina harbor and moves up the coast, roughly parallel to the shore. The School of Posillipo was started by Anton Sminck Pitloo painting marine shore landscapes from this area. The area has been heavily overbuilt since the end of World War II, but contains some notable historical buildings and landmarks. Among these is the Villa Rosebery, the Italian President's residence during his stays in Naples. It also contains a Mausoleum to those who died for their country, the Mausoleo Schilizzi. Sports Posillipo has given its name to Naples' waterpolo team, Circolo Nautico Posillipo. The neighborhood was seat of the homonym circuit which hosted the Grand Prix of Naples between 1933 and 1962.
