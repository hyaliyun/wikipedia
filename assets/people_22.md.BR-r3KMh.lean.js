Biography The evidence for the existence of Sitric is a handful of coins minted at York bearing the inscription (King Sitric). These coins have been dated to 942 and they bear similarities to coins of Olaf Cuaran and Ragnall Guthfrithson, two kinsmen who are known to have ruled Northumbria in the 940s.Spink, p. 119 Two designs of coinage are known featuring Sitric's name.

Downham has suggested that between Olaf's death and the arrival of Ragnall in York, perhaps in the latter part of 943, Northumbria was co-ruled by Sitric and Olaf Cuaran.Downham, p. 111 In coin listings, Sitric is sometimes called \\"Sitric Sitricsson\\", and so identified as a brother of Olaf Cuar√°n and son of Sitric C√°ech.Spink, p. 119; Histories, p. 411 Sitric should not be confused with a king of Dublin of the same name, mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters in 941.

The daughter of activist Oswaldo Pay√°, head of the Christian Liberation Movement, she took up much of his activist work after he died by involuntary manslaughter of √Ångel Carromero on 22 July 2012. Since her father's death in 2012, she and her mother have been living in the Miami area, but frequently travels back to Cuba to visit. Early life and education She is the daughter of Oswaldo Pay√° and his wife, Ofelia Acevedo de Pay√°. She has two brothers, Oswaldo Jos√© and Reinaldo Isa√≠as. She holds a degree in physics and has also studied photography. Activism =2013= In March 2013, Pay√° addressed the UN Human Rights Council, criticizing the Cuban government for its failure to allow a plebiscite on basic freedoms. When she went on to state that her father's death, contrary to the official Cuban line, was not accidental, the Cuban delegate, Juan Quintanilla, began to bang on his desk. He called Pay√° a ‚Äúmercenary‚Äù and asked the president of the UNHRC to silence her. The US member spoke up for Pay√°, while the representatives of China, Russia, Pakistan, Nicaragua, and Belarus supported Cuba. Pay√°, after being allowed to continue, urged the UN to independently investigate her father's death and asked: ‚ÄúWhen will the people of Cuba finally enjoy basic democracy and fundamental freedoms?‚Äù Quintanilla again called her a ‚Äúmercenary‚Äù and a tool of the US government, and accused her of ‚Äúaggression against [her] own people.‚Äù In a March 2013 interview with Cubanet, she discussed her efforts to persuade the United Nations to investigate her father's death, her speech at the HRC, her recent meetings with representatives of various European governments, and her dismay at the solidarity of Spanish socialist politicians with the Cuban government. Asked about Raul Castro's ‚Äúreforms,‚Äù she accused the regime of trying ‚Äúto sell an image of openness‚Äù without actually effecting meaningful change. The reforms themselves, she maintained, were ‚Äúa mechanism of control,‚Äù having been framed not as rights but as ‚Äúa concession by the government.‚Äù In April 2013, Pay√° returned briefly to Cuba after two months' absence. Pay√° wrote in July 2013 about detention centers in the Bahamas where Cuban refugees were undergoing ‚Äúsystematic abuses.‚Äù Speaking at the UN again on 4 November 2013, she criticized Cuba's membership in the Human Rights Council. =2014= In an open letter to President Barack Obama dated 19 December 2014, she questioned America's new Cuba policy, telling Obama that ‚Äúyour laws are not what is preventing the free market and access to information in Cuba; it is the Cuban government‚Äôs legislation and its constant censorship.‚Äù She criticized Obama for ‚Äútreating as 'normal' the illegitimate government in Havana‚Äù and urged him to make ‚Äúa real commitment to the Cuban people‚Äù that would involve not intervention but support for ‚Äúsolutions that we Cubans have created ourselves.‚Äù In a December 2014 article, ‚ÄúOnly Cubans Can Save Cuba,‚Äù she noted that America's change in its Cuban policy occurred only a week after 100 Cuban democracy protesters had been arrested and treated violently. ‚ÄúThe US president has now rewarded the Cuban regime for having released a prisoner,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThe Barack Obama administration has decided to normalize relations with a government that isn‚Äôt normal, because it is not legitimate. The Cuban people never chose it, and it violates our most fundamental human rights. In the ongoing dialogue between the elites of Washington and Havana, where are the Cuban people?‚Äù =2015= In January 2015, Pay√° attended President Obama‚Äôs State of the Union Address as the guest of Senator Marco Rubio. She also spoke with several members of Congress, arguing that U.S. representatives engaged in discussions with the Cuban government should raise the issue of democracy and call for an independent investigation into her father's death. On 24 January, Pay√° met with the senior White House advisor for Latin America, Ricardo Z√∫√±iga, giving him a list of specific points that she felt he should raise in talks with the Cuban government. In April 2015, Pay√° was arrested upon her arrival in Panama, where she attended the Summit of the Americas. At the summit, Barack Obama was scheduled to meet with Ra√∫l Castro, the first meeting between a U.S. president and Cuban dictator since the Cuban Revolution. The arresting police officer told her: ‚ÄúYou are going to be deported to Cuba if you cause any trouble or start raising banners. Go back to your own country to cause trouble.‚Äù After being held for four hours and having her possessions ransacked, she was released. Panamanian officials later claimed that the incident was ‚Äúa bureaucratic mistake.‚Äù The same thing, however, happened to a visiting Argentinian activist, Micaela Hierro Dori. In an article, Pay√° noted that while ‚ÄúCuban civil society activists and the foreigners who work with us were threatened and detained in Panama,‚Äù Panamanian officials did nothing to Cuban government officials attending the summit. At the Forum of Youth Movements, also held in Panama at that time, Pay√° announced the establishment of a new ‚Äúcitizen initiative‚Äù called Cuba Decides that sought to achieve a transition to democracy. The initiative, which called for a plebiscite in Cuba, was viewed as a sort of continuation of her father's Varela Project, which, despite collecting the more than 10,000 signatures required by the Cuban Constitution for the proposal of legislative amendments, had been rejected by the National Assembly. On 11 May 2015, after almost two years in exile, Pay√° returned to Cuba to visit her father's grave. ‚ÄúI return to Havana as a Cuban citizen, with all my documentation,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I also go back exercising the right that entitles all Cubans ‚Äî even if the law recognizes it or not ‚Äî to return to our country at our own discretion.‚Äù Asked by an interviewer whether her visit was temporary or permanent, she replied: ‚ÄúWhere I am visiting is the United States. I interrupted this visit to come to my own country. These definitions of final departure, of living forever in one country or another, belong to the language of totalitarianism. The Cuban government still keeps intact the power to decide whose departure is permanent and who is not allowed to return.‚Äù Asked whether she saw herself as a future leader, she replied: ‚ÄúI do not want to speak for Cubans because Cubans never elected me. I have a proposal: that Cubans have a voice.‚Äù In July 2015 Pay√° went to the new Cuban embassy in Washington with a letter from her mother requesting autopsy reports for Oswaldo Pay√° and Harold Cepero, but embassy officials, who saw her through a window, did not answer the door and summoned the police. Writing in November 2015 after the jihadist massacre in Paris, she recalled a visit to that city two years earlier. Visiting the Eiffel Tower, she had heard a variety of languages being spoken around her and thought: ‚Äúthis is the sound of freedom of movement. Something thousands of Cubans have not had.‚Äù She now noted wryly, however, that this freedom of movement had also made possible the jihadist massacre. ‚ÄúSolidarity,‚Äù she concluded, ‚Äúis no longer a question of altruism but of survival. We do not ask for whom the bell tolls. As in Paris and so in Havana, it tolls for all of us.‚Äù In December 2015, Pay√° was elected president of the Latin American Youth Network for Democracy at its congress in Costa Rica. She then led a delegation from the Latin American Network of Youth for Democracy to Venezuela to observe legislative elections. The purpose, she said, was to convey a ‚Äúsignal of solidarity‚Äù to Venezuelan democrats. While in Venezuela she held an event with Lilian Tintori, wife of Leopoldo Lopez, to call for his release from prison. =2016= In February 2016, she addressed the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, accusing the Castros of perpetrating ‚Äúa fake transition not to democracy, but to legitimize their total control upon Cuban society, with a renewed image for the international public opinion, in order to attract foreign investors and financial credits.‚Äù This process, she charged, was leading Cuba toward a system of ‚Äúdynastic State capitalism‚Äù or ‚ÄúCastro capitalism.‚Äù Later in February, she traveled to Cuba to attend a mass in Havana in memory of her father. She also handed government representatives a petition, signed by 10,000 Cubans, asking for a plebiscite on freedom. 2017 In February 2017, she called on President Donald Trump to \\"press firmly on the Cuban government to respond to the claims of its people for the first time in 60 years.\\" In the same month, Acevedo and other Cuban dissidents recognized Luis Almagro, the secretary-general of the Organization of American States, for \\"defending human rights in their country even though the government denied him entry to attend the ceremony.\\" Honors The magazine ‚ÄúPeople en Espa√±ol‚Äù named her one of the 25 most powerful Latin women of 2014, along with such celebrities as Jennifer L√≥pez and Sof√≠a Vergara.

She stood out as a translator and writer. Life and work Sibylle Ursula was born in Hitzacker, the third child of Duke Augustus (1579‚Äì1666) from his second marriage with the Ascanian princess Dorothea of Anhalt-Zerbst (1607‚Äì1634). Her father assumed the rule in the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1634. Sibylle Ursula became the stepdaughter of Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg (1613‚Äì1676), the third wife of Duke Augustus who had distinguished herself as a poet and composer. Like her siblings, the Brunswick dukes Rudolph Augustus and Anthony Ulrich, she received a comprehensive education at the Wolfenb√ºttel court by scholars like Justus Georg Schottel and Sigmund von Birken. For several years, she kept up a correspondence with Madeleine de Scud√©ry and Johannes Valentinus Andreae. Sibylle Ursula wrote part of a novel, Die Durchlauchtige Syrerin Aramena (Aramena, the noble Syrian lady), which when complete would be the most famous courtly novel in German Baroque literature; it was finished by her brother Anthony Ulrich and edited by Sigmund von Birken. Other writings of hers include a five-act play and a series of spiritual meditations. Translations of hers include two novels (Cassandre and Cl√©op√¢tre) by La Calpren√®de, parts of Scud√©ry's Cl√©lie, and Introductio ad sapientiam, one of the Latin writings of Juan Luis Vives, a Spanish humanist. Initially determined to remain unmarried, in 1663 she eventually entered into marriage with Duke Christian of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg (1627‚Äì1698), at the age of 34. Her husband, the only surviving son of Duke Philip of Schleswig-Holstein-Gl√ºcksburg, had taken over the rule at Gl√ºcksburg Castle the year before and was able to restore public finances with the help of his Wolfenb√ºttel relatives. Sibylle Ursula fell seriously ill already in 1664, probably from syphilis passed on by her husband, which brought and ending to her artistic work. Suffering from an ever-increasingly depressive state, she died in childbirth. None of her children reached adulthood.

Born on April 2, 1907 in Newark, New Jersey Carmichael was the second of three children born to James Henry Carmichael and Ida Coe Miner. James H. Carmichael, Jr. died of cancer at his home on December 1, 1983 in Delray Beach, Florida. Career Carmichael worked as a miner, a clerk and a farmer before learning to fly in 1926 at the age of 19. After six hours of flying lessons, he became a flight instructor himself. Some of his first flight jobs consisted of crop-dusting, barnstorming and stunt flying before settling in as an Airmail pilot and mechanic for Central Airlines. He received his Limited Commercial Pilot rating, no. 3490, in 1928. He married Jessie Northrop, of the famous aviation family, on July 4, 1930. He went to work for Pittsburgh Airways in 1931 for a short time and then Newark Air Service from 1931 to 1934. In 1934 he was a hired by Central Airlines as a mechanic and the company's first pilot. In 1935 he was recommended by the President of the Air Line Pilots Association, Dave Behncke, and was awarded the Airmail Flyers Medal of Honor for safely landing an aircraft with six passengers after an engine fell off, smashing one landing wheel and damaging a second engine over Hancock, Maryland. Carmichael, nicknamed \\"Slim\\" due to his tall slender build, became one of only 10 pilots to receive the medal and was number 8 in a series of 8 box covers on the popular breakfast cereal Wheaties. On November 16, not more than two weeks after receiving his medal, he was taking off from the Allegheny County Airport and made it less than 100 feet above the runway when the engines on the Stinson Model A (NO-15108) Tri-motor began to sputter and then stop completely. He and co-pilot Edward Gerber along with lone passenger Tracey Baker, of Chicago, were all ok after he made a quick belling landing. The plane slid some 300 feet at 100 mph across the landing field, over a 30-foot embankment and into thick underbrush before coming to a stop. The following investigation determined water in the fuel as the cause of the engine failure. In 1936 Carmichael moved from Chief Pilot to Operations Manager after Pennsylvania Airlines and Central Airlines merged becoming Pennsylvania Central Airlines (PCA). By 1939 Slim was the Director of Operations and went to Santa Monica, California to pilot the first of PCA's new fleet of DC-3s from Douglas Aircraft factory to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. December 18, 1945 he was elected Vice President in charge of operations for PCA. He headed the Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee (TIIC) that studied German military and commercial aviation (APO 413). The TIIC was created as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on September 14, 1945, but transferred to the Department of Commerce in January 1946. The TIIC was the search group mechanism, composed of 380 civilians representing seventeen American Industries with direct links to major American manufacturing concerns. The worst air disaster for Capital Airways during his career occurred on the evening of June 13, 1947. The following day Carmichael was one of the first to arrive on site of the crash along with Red Cross Official Gordon O Stone, and Capital's Maintenance Director James Franklin. Franklin had spotted the crash site from a small search plane. The three had to abandon their jeep and hike 3 miles to the crash site due to the rain soaked ground. The wreckage covered more than 100 yards of the forest and would require a bulldozer to clear a path for recovery vehicles. The DC-4, a converted Army C-54, which went missing the night before, had flow at full speed and level flight strait into the side of the mountain just 200 feet below the summit. It was the third major airline crash in 15 days. With this being the third crash of a former Army C-54 the military grounded all remaining C-54s pending an investigation. He eventually rose to Executive Vice President of the Airlines and in 1947 he was named President. He remained the president when PCA became Capital Airlines. During his time as president of the company the airline was in financial trouble. He introduced the \\"Nighthawk\\" service providing fairs on evening flights at a reduced rate to compete with the railroad ticket prices. This became the nation's first coach fair and boosted nighttime flying during a time the planes would have been sitting in the hangars. With the new coach fair's catching on flying was no longer just for the well to do. With his innovative thinking and aggressive cost cutting style Carmichael was able to reduce the company's $10 million debt and posted a profit of $1.5 million by 1950 and Capital became the 5th largest airline in the booming industry. In 1954 Carmichael, as president of Capital Airlines, announced the purchase of Viscount turboprop airplanes, introducing the turbo-jet airliner by the British Vickers-Armstrong Company to American commercial air travel and providing the first jet powered airlines in the nation. This provided more long term stability and growth for the Airline. He tried to consolidate with other airlines but was unsuccessful. In 1957 Lansing Michigan, Capital Airlines Michigan base, voiced its frustration over poor service and years of promised improvement. That same year Capital realized its highest profits ever with an increase in passengers and cargo and a decrease in Airmail. Carmichael was president of Capital Airlines from 1947 to 1957 and chairman until 1958 when he resigned amide conflicts over a proposed merger with United Airlines. Capital would eventually merge into United Airlines in 1961. On May 8, 1958 he received the Horatio Alger Award, from the American Schools and Colleges Association for his exceptional rise to prominence in business and industry. The presentation took place in New York City along with seven other awardees. After leaving Capital Airlines he joined the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation in September 1958. In December he was made Executive Vice President and then President in 1959. He held a unique position in the aviation community as the only airplane manufacture to have ever served as an airline President, that being with Capitol Airlines from 1947 to 1957. At this time Fairchild was producing the Fairchild F-27, a jet-prop airliner designed for the smaller \\"Feeder\\" airlines. During his time as President Carmichael and Fairchild employees worked with the community including blood drives for the American Red Cross as well as honoring Boy Scouts at the annual Eagle Scouts Award dinner. With lower than expected orders of the F-27, continued layoffs, and heavy losses there was a shake up in the leadership. In October 1960 he resigned and was replaced by founder, and board chairman, Sherman M Fairchild. He joined the Riddle Airlines, later Airlift International, board of directors in August 1962 and was made chairman in September. He had previously been a consultant for Riddle. He retired in 1978 after several years of running J. H. Carmichael Associates, a Washington lobbying firm, and serving as a special assistant in the Federal Aviation Administration. 1937 era Wheaties cereal box cover #8 of 8 in the Airmail Flyers' Medal of Honor series. The flight incident On a night flight over Maryland's mountains from Washington, D.C. to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the left motor of Slim Carmichael's tri-motored plane shook loose and, dropping like a plummet, and smashed a landing wheel! What a spot to be in! Treacherous inky black peaks below and the closest airport 100 miles away ‚Äì back in Washington! A moment to check the situation, and Carmichael swiftly turned back. Hurriedly he radioed for an emergency landing at Bolling Field. Then, as suddenly as the left motor had torn loose, the remaining motors sputtered and went dead! A quick check showed that the controls also were damaged by the falling motor. Making emergency repairs while the plane rapidly lost altitude, Slim got the two motors started again just in the nick of time. With one motor and half the landing gear carried away, Carmichael circled Bolling Field, while rescue squads scurried into position. Calling on all his skill as a flyer, Carmichael put his battered ship down on one wheel and the tail-skid. A moment of breathless anticipation! The plane wobbled from the impact steadied and came to an awkward but safe landing! Cool-headed action in a ticklish situation won Slim Carmichael's medal fairly, again proving the high caliber of America's commercial aviators.

He is more commonly known for having the earliest gold mining camp on the Witwatersrand named after him called Ferreirastown (Ferreirasdorp), which was on the edge of the farm Randjeeslagte soon to be proclaimed as the site of a new town called Johannesburg. Early life He was born in Grahamstown in 1840 to father Ignatius Ferreira and mother Hendrika Pohl. He was educated at the Wesleyan Grammar School in Grahamstown. He would later marry Baltrina Erasmus, in 1862, also known as Neef Naas. He would take up farming before moving to Kimberley where he attempted to prospect unsuccessfully for diamonds but met Sam Wemmer. When Sam Wemmer moved to Middlesburg in the Transvaal to farm, Ferreira soon followed and resumed farming. He would later attempt to prospect for gold in Pilgrim's Rest, Kaapsche Hoop and in Barberton. Military career His military career started in the Cape Colony as a trooper in the Cape Mounted Police, training under Sir Walter Currie. While living in the Transvaal, he became a Field Cornet under Schalk Burger and served in the first war against the Secocoeni in 1876. In 1877, Ferreira raised a unit called Ferreira's Horse for the first time. Early in 1879, Ferreira and his new unit took part with other British forces in the Anglo-Zulu War in Zululand against the Zulu leader King Cetshwayo. The unit was said to consist of 115 men serving under General Henry Buller. Later in the same year on 28 November 1879, Ferreira took part in the Secocoeni Campaign in the North-eastern Transvaal, where he again commanded the Ferreira's Horse. The British and Native force under the command of Colonel Baker Russell would attack the stronghold of the Pedi tribes leader, King Sekukuni in the Sekhukhuneland. The tribe, having taken refuge in a mountain stronghold, was assaulted by Ferreira and the British and native forces over several days before the tribal king surrendered on 2 Dec 1879 to him. For his effort in the campaign he was awarded the companion class of Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG). In late 1880s, Ferreira and his horseman would take part in the Basuto War. It was raised for a third time outside Pretoria, also known as the Transvaal Horse, and would assist the Cape Colony to put down the Basuto rebels and took with it two 9-pounder field guns. It was disbanded in 1881 and at that time had a strength of 450 men. Witwatersrand Ferreira arrived on the Witwatersrand in June 1886, and erected a reed hut on land on the farm Turffontein close to were the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court presently resides. Soon potential gold prospectors arrived and their tents, wagons, reed huts and wood-iron building were gathered around Ferreira's position and he would lay out what came to be called Ferreira's Camp, in a military fashion with tents lined up and aligned the roadways. On 24 July 1886, George Harrison sent a letter, a sworn declaration, to the government in Pretoria, that he had found payable gold on Gert C. Oosthuizen's farm Langlaagte. Ferreira and 72 other prospectors, after viewing Harrison's outcrop, realized the reef lay on line east to west, petitioned the government on 26 July 1886 to have area proclaimed as a goldfield. During June and July, he would peg claims and obtained mining leases. The proclamation of the goldfields occurred on 9 September. At Ferreira's Camp, he unofficially maintained law and order. According to the South African Republic Gold Law, the Mine Commissioner of the proclaimed goldfield could make arrangements for a Diggers Committee. This committee would develop the regulations concerning water rights, public safety, health and other issues in conjunction with the Mine Commissioner. A notice was placed on 19 October 1886, calling for candidates to stand for election on 8 November. Twenty-five men put their names forward for the nine positions, with Ferreira obtaining the most votes and gain a position on Digger's Committee. Two mines, the Ferreira Gold Mining Company and Ferreira Deep, established later on claims he owned and had sold, would be named after the man who played a role in the success of the mining camp at Johannesburg. Death After playing an undistinguished role during the Second Boer War, he would settle on the farm Kranspoort, 56 km west of the town of Louis Trichardt, Northern Transvaal and died there in May 1921.

He ruled in the Malwa region, in second half of the 13th century CE, during 1270s and 1280s. Arjuna II succeeded Jayavarman II (alias Jayasimha), and proved to be a weak ruler. After Jayasimha's death around 1275 CE, the Paramara minister rebelled against his king. This fact has been mentioned by the Muslim historian Wassaf, who does not name the king or the minister. The minister was probably Goga. In the 1270s, Ramachandra, the Yadava king of Devagiri invaded Malwa. The Udari inscription of Ramachandra, issued in 1276 CE, states that the Yadava king was \\"a lion in destroying the multitude of the rutting elephants of Arjuna\\". in the 1280s, the Ranthambore Chahamana ruler Hammira also raided Malwa. The Balvan inscription of 1288 CE mentions that Hammira captured the elephant force of Arjuna. Jain poet Nayachandra Suri's Hammira Mahakavya states that Hammira defeated Arjuna of Sarasapura and Bhoja of Dhara. Based on this, R. C. Majumdar concluded that Hammira must have invaded Malwa twice: once during the reign of Arjuna II, and again, during the reign of his successor Bhoja II. Pratipal Bhatia theorizes that Arjuna II's minister Goga-deva put Bhoja II on the throne of the Paramara capital Dhara as a titular king, while Arjuna II continued to controlled another part of the kingdom.

As a child, she was sold to the wandering entertainer Li Jingchun and his wife Mrs Bian, who renamed her Li Huimin L«ê Hu√¨m«ên). Her status within the family was reduced when Mrs Bian gave birth to a son, Li Guozhang. She was then forced to earn money on the street by singing stories accompanied by a small drum or other instrument. At fourteen, she began learning pingju from Dong Faliang, taking supporting roles under the stage name \\"Bai Yushuang\\". She became celebrated in Beiping (now Beijing) and Tianjin for her extreme range, from very high notes to lower than lowest note of the erhu. Upon Li Jingchun's death, his widow Mrs Bian purchased more girls from poor families. The 4-year-old Xiaodezi was renamed Fuzi and instructed to refer to Li Guizhen as her mother. Bai Yushuang began to perform lead roles for the Yushun Opera Troupe. This company was owned by Mrs Bian, managed by her brother, and accompanied by her son on the erhu, a situation which led to its being generally known as the Li Troupe (Lijia Ban). Bai Yushuang eventually changed its name to the North China Opera Troupe Hu√°bƒõi X√¨sh√®). She became notorious as a \\"slutty performer\\" (, y√≠nl√≠ng) and \\"contaminant\\" following her performance as a fly spirit in the 1933 Catching Flies Zhu≈ç CƒÅngying), when her costume consisted of a red dudou and tight white clothes under some long scarves, and was expelled from Beiping by its mayor for performing \\"obscene lyrics\\". The Chinese periodical Women's Lives reported icily that \\"thousands of square miles of Chinese territory have been occupied by the Japanese without any resistance, but if a woman offends public decency, she must be expelled.\\" Relocating to Shanghai in 1935, Li Guizhen performed pingju alongside Ai Lianjun, Yu Lingzhi, and Zhao Ruquan to large audiences at the Enpaiya Theater and on tour through Suzhou, Wuxi, and Nanjing.

Dimsdale, who had a high reputation in the new field of smallpox inoculation and had written a book on the subject, was invited in 1762 by Catherine the Great to travel to Russia and inoculate herself and her son, Grand-Duke Paul. Accordingly, Dimsdale and his second son Nathaniel travelled to Russia in 1768 and carried out the procedure to the great satisfaction of the Empress, who rewarded both him and his son with annuities and a Barony of the Russian Empire, with the right for it to be inherited by the eldest lawful descendants. Nathaniel died with no male heir. The Barony awarded to his father, however, descended via his eldest son John (1747‚Äì1820) for several generations. On John's death it passed to his brother Robert (1756‚Äì1825) and thence to the latter's eldest son, Thomas Robert (1796‚Äì1865), who was High Sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1831. He was succeeded by his brother, Charles John (1801‚Äì1872), High Sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1843, and he in turn by his son Robert (1828‚Äì1898), banker and MP for Hertford. Charles Robert Southwell (1856‚Äì1928) was High Sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1917.

Because of the rules for CP football, he was not able to earn his first national team cap until he was a 16-years- old. The United States tried but failed to qualify for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. If they had been successful, Ballou would likely have made the roster. He continued his national team career, and was part of the US team that finished 11th at the 2009 World Championships. He continued to get national team calls ups, and was with the US team that finished second at the 2010 Americas Championship. The following year, he participated in the 2011 CPISRA World Championships with the national team. An eighth-place finish at this tournament qualified the United States for the London Games. Ballou spent much time preparing for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. When not with the national team, he trained at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex. Having taken a semester off to prepare for the Games, he spent much time in 2012 training with the national team in Chula Vista, California and was formally chosen by national team head coach Jay Hoffman to be on the London bound national team. The 2012 Games were his first, as the national team had not qualified for Beijing.

The United States was drawn in Group B with Ukraine, Great Britain and Brazil. The Americans did not win a single game, losing all 5 matches they played in. After the Games when he returned to the USA, he was with the team when they met US President Barack Obama. His participation in London gave him the resolve to try to make the roster for the 2016 Games. In April 2014, Ballou was invited to participate in a week long national team training camp at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. The camp was being held in preparation for the 7-a-side Football Ciutat de Barcelona in June of that year.

The project was controversial since it had a major environmental impact and during operations released more greenhouse gases than a comparable oil-fuelled plant. Reservoir The Samuel dam impounds the Jamari River, a right tributary of the Madeira River. It is about from Porto Velho. The Jamari River originates in the Paca√°s Novos Mountains to the south at an altitude of about . The catchment area is just , or 24 times the area of the reservoir. The river delivers an annual flow of per second. The dam contains a volume of and covers at normal maximum level of above sea level. The main reservoir is long by wide, and extends further to the south for another with a width of . Since the terrain is relatively flat, of dikes were built along the right and left banks to hold the water. Construction Construction began towards the end of a period of military dictatorship, during the abertura transition to democracy. The governor of the federal territory of Rond√¥nia was the army colonel Jorge Teixeira. Teixerira was a strong promoter of development in Rond√¥nia. The hydroelectric project was linked to the 1982 POLONOROESTE project funded by the World Bank that rebuilt and paved the BR-364 highway and opened Rond√¥nia to a flood of migrants from the state of Paran√°. The road project caused a surge of deforestation and had a large impact on the indigenous people. In 1987 the World Bank President, Barber Conable, called the road project \\"a sobering example of an environmentally sound effort which went wrong.\\" Construction started in April 1982. 238 farming families were relocated. A 1981 World Bank report noted that a large amount of fine timber would have to be removed. This could easily be done using the nearby paved road from Ariquemes to Porto Velho, then via Manaus and Santar√©m to the overseas markets. The report recommended that the IBDF take an inventory and develop a marketing strategy as soon as possible. The first of five turbines was installed on 24 July 1989 and the last on 2 August 1996. The installed capacity is 216 MW. Cost excluding transmission was US$965 million. With an area / capacity ratio of 2.59 km2/MW the dam compares poorly to most other hydroelectric power plants in the Amazon Region other than Curu√°-Una at 2.60 and Balbina at 9.44. Operations By 1990, a year after starting operation, the power station provided 36% of Rond√¥nia's electricity. This had risen to 58% by 1996. The number of households in the state with electricity rose from 40,419 in 1983 to 132,157 in 1990. The Samuel power plant was initially designed to supply the cities of Guajar√°-Mirim, Ariquemes, Ji-Paran√°, Pimenta Bueno, Vilhena, Abun√£ and the capital, Porto Velho. On 20 November 2002 Rio Branco, the capital of Acre, was connected to the plant. In 2009 the Samuel plant delivered 910,889 MWh to the Acre-Rond√¥nia grid, a monthly average of 103.98 MW. The assured output of the plant is about 85 MW, but the higher amount was made possible by unusually high rainfall and availability of all five generating units. As of 2016 electricity was being delivered from the plant to 90% of the municipalities of Rond√¥nia. Eletrobras Eletronorte also operates the 90 MW Rio Madeira thermal power plant. When independent producers are included Eletrobras Eletronorte has a total installed capacity of 403 MW. In September 2015 the 11th Annual Fishing Tournament was held on the reservoir, attended by fishermen from Rond√¥nia, Acre and Mato Grosso states. More than R$30,000 in prizes were awarded. On 18 March 2016 a large group of protesters blocked the BR-364 highway in Candeias do Jamari. They were demanding a meeting with the state government and city council to address compensation that had not yet been paid to families affected by the Samuel hydroelectric plant. Environmental impact Efforts were made to save land animals when the reservoir started filling. The value of the well-publicized $US30 million rescue operation was questionable, since relatively small numbers of the total animal population were rescued. These were released at the lake edge where they caused critical overpopulation. To compensate for the loss of forest by flooding the reservoir Eletronorte created the Samuel Ecological Station to the east of the reservoir's embankment about from the dam. On 29 December 1997 the station's limits were extended to an area of . The Ecological Station covers a large part of the reservoir, and extends to the east. Almost all of the reservoir area was covered in tropical forest before the dam was built. Although not required by law, Eletronorte conducted a series of environmental studies, but these were later criticized for lack of depth and objectivity. It has been noted that the region was undergoing rapid deforestation when the dam was built, so the area now covered by the dam would probably otherwise be covered by degraded cattle pasture, as is the case in neighbouring areas. However, an exception to the Brazilian law prohibiting export of logs was created for Samuel, and this caused a boom in illegal logging throughout the western Amazon basin. Satellite images from 1984 and 2011 show a dramatic expansion of deforestation in the areas to the north, west and south of the dam. The dam emits more greenhouse gas than an oil-fuelled power plant with the same capacity would emit. In 1990 the reservoir emitted 11.6 times more greenhouse gases than an oil-burning plant would have given off making the same amount of energy. This has since declined to a stable level of 2.6 times higher than the fossil fuel alternative. The reservoir methylated mercury present in the soil, contaminating fish. Fish populations were studied before and after the dam was built. They showed a drop in diversity, but an increase in the populations of species that included Cichla sp. (tucunare), Schizodon fasciatus (aracu comum), Hypophthalmus marginatus (mapar√°) and Serrasalmus rhombeus (piranha preta). The reservoir is now used intensively for fishing, which in the past had been confined to the mouth of the river, causing concerns about sustainability.

It was published by Lyons Press, an imprint of Rowman & Littlefield, on August 1, 2015. The Making of the Book Simone approached Henry Hill and proposed to develop the Lufthansa project. Hill agreed, and Simone began debriefing him on a daily basis for an exhaustive two-year period. To corroborate Hill's account, Simone solicited the cooperation of Steve Carbone and Ed Guevara, the two FBI agents who spearheaded the Lufthansa investigation, and Ed McDonald, the US Attorney who was in charge of the case. Simone conducted his own research, and interviewed several former Mafia gangsters who were indirectly involved in the Lufthansa raid. (See Authors' Notes and Sources Page in The Lufthansa Heist).https://www.wsj.com/article_email/the-great-plane- robbery-1440628066-lMyQjAxMTI1MTI4ODYyMjg0Wj Simone also interviewed New York Police Detective Joe Coffey, who provided additional information regarding the failed investigation. Daniel Simone consulted court records and reviewed dozens of newspaper articles about the infamous robbery. In addition, Simone referenced television documentaries that describe and set forth the salient details of the event. Retired FBI Agent Steve Carbone wrote the Foreword in The Lufthansa Heist and Agent Ed Guevara wrote the Afterword. (See The Lufthansa Heist by Daniel Simone & Henry Hill Pages IX and 347). Writing Style Daniel Simone wrote The Lufthansa Heist in the Narrative Non-Fiction genre\`, a unique technique of writing non-fiction books in the fashion of a novel. This style enlivens the story with dramatization, character development, lifelike dialogues, and vivid scenes, lending the story a cinematic effect. The genre\` was created by Truman Capote when he authored his magnum opus, In Cold Blood. Capote originally labeled this writing manner as Fictionalized Journalism, though ultimately the term evolved to Narrative Non- Fiction. Storyline The book is about the 1978 robbery of the Lufthansa Airline cargo building at Kennedy Airport. Henry Hill, immortalized in Martin Scorsese's blockbuster film, Goodfellas, was one of the organizers. This robbery stands as the largest unrecovered cash theft in history. In 1967, Hill conspired with an Air France cargo foreman to burglarize the Air France high- value vault. Hill cleverly eluded the authorities and drove out of Kennedy Airport with $480,000 in cash and jewels. (in 1967 $480,000 equated to approximately $5,000,000 at present value). Later that evening, though, in the midst of celebrating his windfall, two prostitutes, who had represented themselves as advertising executives, robbed Hill out of $30,000. But despite this relatively minor setback, Hill's associates, members of the Lucchese Crime Family, considered the Air France robbery a substantial theft, and Hill rose in his ranks. In the years following the Air France sensation, in collusion with air cargo workers, Hill became experienced in pilfering from airlines. Among other criminalities, they'd steal pricey shipments, extort from cargo companies, and hijack delivery trucks. In 1978, Hill and Jimmy Burke were released from prison. They'd served a five-year sentence for an extortion conviction unrelated to the airport thieveries. At that time, a Lufthansa shipping clerk, Louis Werner, owed gambling debts to a bookmaker, Marty Krugman, an associate of Hill. Werner was not in a financial capacity to settle with Krugman, but offered information on how to penetrate into the German Airline's cargo building, where cash and high valuables were stored. In exchange, the shipping clerk demanded for Krugman to forgive his gambling debts. Krugman in turn relayed this proposal to Hill, who brought it to the attention of his crew chief, Jimmy \\"the Gent\\" Burke. Burke was affiliated with Lucchese Capo Paul Vario. Burke selected six armed robbers from his Robert's Lounge Gang. On December 11, 1978 at 3:00 a.m., the gunmen entered Lufthansa Cargo Building 261 at Kennedy Airport and held hostage the night staff. Two of the perpetrators forced the supervisor to disarm the alarm system of the high- value vault and hauled out bundles of cash and jewels, totaling $6,000,000. (Approximately $42,000,000 at present value) When the robbery was reported, several law enforcement agencies swarmed into the Lufthansa Cargo Complex. The New York Port Authority Police, The New York Police Department, The Queens County District Attorney, and the FBI took immense interest in this crime of epic proportion. The book claims that a rivalry developed between them. The Lufthansa heist was the subject of national headlines for months to follow, and the book suggests that every law enforcement agent wished to assume control of the investigation, in order to take credit for solving the crime. In fact, the competition to dominate the case became so intense that the various law enforcement agencies threw one another off course by sabotaging their investigations. The winners were the FBI and the US attorney. But for Burke and the Robert's Lounge Gang matters became problematic when one of their accomplices, Stacks Edwards, failed to deliver the getaway van to an auto wrecking yard for it to be destroyed. Instead, he parked it near a fire hydrant and spent the night snorting cocaine with his girlfriend. The police discovered the van and lifted fingerprints that matched those of the perpetrators, who had already been under suspicion. Consequently, Jimmy Burke ordered Stacks to be murdered. For a variety of reasons, Burke murdered twelve additional individuals who were directly and indirectly involved in the robbery. The primary incentives for Burke to liquidate his associates were not to share the stolen cash, and to ensure they would not testify against him. In the interim, Louis Werner, the Lufthansa employee who collaborated with the perpetrators, was the only person arrested and convicted for his participation in the heist. Burke had shielded himself from Werner and dealt with him through an obscure intermediary. Thus Werner did not have first-hand knowledge as to who had masterminded and carried out the robbery. In the end, he wasn't in a position to assist the FBI in apprehending the culprits. Unable to provide the authorities incriminating information about the Lufthansa gunmen, he couldn't plea bargain and was sentenced to five years of incarceration. Meanwhile, Henry Hill and Jimmy Burke had also orchestrated and were immersed in a widespread sports scandals, the Boston College basketball point shaving scheme. Hill claims that he recruited three Boston College players, Jim Sweeney, Rick Kunz, and Earnie Cobb, who for a share of the winning bets manipulated the games' final scores so to keep the point spread under the bookmakers' odds. But the plan veered off course. One of the point shaving scheme cohorts, Paul Mazzei, in possession of $180,000 belonging to Burke, Vario, and Hill, was instructed to go to Las Vegas to bet it on the Boston College games. Mazzei, though, absconded, and Hill & Company lost a large sum of money. In 1984, Cobb was found not guilty of involvement in the scheme after a two-week trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/24/sports/cobb-not-guilty-in-point-shaving- trial.html At the same time, Hill was distributing narcotics, for which he, his wife, and mistress were indicted and held without bail. In the course of the pre-arrest surveillance of Hill's phones, he repeatedly referred to one of his associates in the drug ring as \\"the big Irishman in Albany\\". Hill's prosecutor, the Nassau County District Attorney, was convinced that \\"the big Irishman\\" was then New York State Governor Hugh Carey. Eager to prosecute a prominent Governor, the District Attorney, without investigating further, gave Hill full immunity for the drug charges. In exchange, the prosecutor expected Hill to reveal the identity of his partners in the drug conspiracy, principally Governor Carey. But to the great dismay of the District Attorney, \\"the big Irishman\\" was not Governor Carey; rather it was Jimmy Burke. Nonetheless, the District Attorney was compelled to uphold the plea deal with Hill, who dodged the narcotics indictment. However, despite Hill's escape from prosecution, Burke was not about to chance that his former partner might inform on him. And Burke thought it best to have Hill slated as his next murder victim. Knowing his fate was sealed, Hill decided to enter the Federal Witness Protection Program and help the US Attorney prosecute Lucchese Capo Paul Vario, Jimmy Burke, and other Mafia members. Hill also informed on the three Boston College Basketball players he claimed had participated in the point shaving scheme, and Paul Mazzei. In the end, save Henry Hill, all the characters attached to the Lufthansa heist were murdered or died in prison. Hill remained in the Witness Protection Program and toured the country lecturing high school students not to lead the lifestyles of outlaws, advocating to assume law abiding lives. But the largest unrecovered cash robbery and Jimmy Burke's murderous spree was never solved, and to date remain cloaked in mysteries. Film Adaptations Emmy Award winner, Cayman Grant and her company, Titan Steel Productions, optioned The Lufthansa Heist for a full- feature film adaptation for theatres.

The book follows Humboldt from his early childhood and travels through Europe as a young man to his journey through Latin America and his return to Europe. Wulf makes the case that Humboldt synthesized knowledge from many different fields to form a vision of nature as one interconnected system, that would go on to influence scientists, activists and the public.  Sections  Part 1. Departure: Emerging Ideas Wulf describes Humboldt's childhood with his emotionally distant mother. As a child his interests in nature and travel were not taken seriously. His mother, on whom he was financially dependent, insisted he become a civil servant. As a young man, Humboldt became friends with Goethe and other German intellectuals. His mother's death allowed him the freedom and financial independence needed to journey to the New World. Part 2 Arrival: Collecting Ideas Humboldt arrives in Venezuela with his companion Bonpland and begins his journey through Central and South America. He brought with him a plethora of scientific instruments. He chronicles his travels and the measurements he obtained using scientific instruments in his journals. Humboldt climbs the Chimborazo Volcano, which was then believed to be highest mountain in the world. The trip concludes with his visit to the United States where he visited the White House to discuss science and politics with Thomas Jefferson before returning to Europe. Part 3 Return: Sorting Ideas Humboldt returns to Europe where he is greeted as a celebrity. He lives as an expat in Paris for seven months as he finds the city and its scientific culture more stimulating than that of Berlin. While in France, he meets a young Simon Bolivar, who is impressed with Humboldt's knowledge and passion for his home country of Venezuela, and they discuss South American politics. Humboldt returns to Prussia, to earn a salary in the King's court before returning to Paris. At this point he begins to work on several manuscripts based on his travels. The books are widely read. As Bolivar begins to plan and execute revolutions in South America, Humboldt publishes a series of books on the politics of Latin America that criticize colonialism. Part 4 New Worlds: Spreading Ideas Wulf discusses Humboldt's personal correspondence and influence on a young Charles Darwin, who attributed to Humboldt the inspiration for an interest in natural science leading to his voyage on the Beagle. Humboldt's influence on the American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau is explored. Humboldt's magnum opus Cosmos, where he talks of the interconnections of the natural world, is discussed.  Reception  Invention of Nature became a New York Times bestseller. Some critics felt that the book could have covered Humboldt more thoroughly instead of focusing on people he influenced.Price, M.

Part of the historic 2011 Super Outbreak, the largest tornado outbreak on record, this was the first of four EF5 tornadoes to touch down that day and the first such storm in Mississippi since the 1966 Candlestick Park tornado. While on the ground for 30 minutes, it traveled along a near path through four counties, leaving behind three deaths, eight injuries, and $1.1 million in damage. The supercell thunderstorm that produced this tornado formed around 1:00 p.m. CDT south of Jackson, Mississippi. Traveling briskly to the northeast, it became severe within 25 minutes and potentially tornadic by 1:36 p.m. CDT. A tornado finally touched down at 2:30 p.m. CDT just east of the Philadelphia Municipal Airport. It quickly intensified and began producing EF5 damage by 2:38 p.m. CDT; extreme ground scouring, up to deep in places, occurred in northeastern Neshoba County. After crossing into Kemper County, the tornado obliterated a mobile home, killing all three inside. It reached EF5 strength a second time near the Kemper‚ÄìWinston county line where extreme ground scouring again took place and pavement was scoured from roads. Extensive tree damage took place elsewhere along the track and it ultimately dissipated at 3:00 p.m. CDT about north of Mashulaville. Meteorological synopsis Damage swath of the tornado across eastern Mississippi The environmental conditions leading up to the April 2011 Super Outbreak were among the \\"most conducive to violent tornadoes ever documented\\". On April 25, a vigorous upper-level shortwave trough moved into the Southern Plains states. Ample instability, low-level moisture, and wind shear fueled a significant tornado outbreak from Texas to Tennessee; at least 64 tornadoes touched down that same day. An area of low pressure consolidated over Texas on April 26 and traveled east while the aforementioned shortwave trough traversed the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys. Another 50 tornadoes touched down on that day. The multi-day outbreak culminated on April 27 with the most violent recorded day of tornadic activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak. Multiple episodes of tornadic activity ensued with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning hours, followed by a widespread outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon into the evening. Activity on April 27 was precipitated by a 995 mbar (hPa; 29.39 inHg) surface low situated over Kentucky and a deep, negatively tilted (aligned northwest to southeast) trough over Arkansas and Louisiana. A strong southwesterly surface jet intersected these systems at a 60¬∞ angle, an ageostrophic flow that led to storm-relative helicity values in excess of 500 m2s‚àí2‚Äîindicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for rotating updrafts within supercells. Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was brought north across the Deep South, leading to daytime high temperatures of and dewpoints of . Furthermore, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values reached 2,500‚Äì3,000 J/kg‚àí1. Tornado summary A brick home that was leveled by the tornado. Around 1:00 p.m. CDT, a supercell thunderstorm developed south of Jackson, Mississippi, and traveled northeast at . About 25 minutes later, the intensifying storm became severe and prompted a severe thunderstorm warning‚Äîadvising residents of damaging winds in excess of and diameter hail‚Äîfrom the National Weather Service office in Jackson for Leake, Rankin, and Scott counties. The developing storm gradually developed a hook echo signature, and a tornado warning was issued for Leake and Scott counties at 1:36 p.m. CDT, and extended to Neshoba County at 2:03 p.m. CDT. At 2:30 p.m. CDT, the storm produced a small tornado along the northern edge of Philadelphia, just east of Philadelphia Municipal Airport and near an Army National Guard armory. Here, large trees were downed and a building sustained significant damage of this roof. Within minutes, the tornado began producing EF2 damage to homes and other structures. It soon grew to in diameter and warranted the issuance of a tornado emergency for northeastern Neshoba County at 2:36 p.m. CDT. Traveling along and parallel to Highway 21, the tornado leveled and partially swept away a brick home near the intersection with Highway 491, indicative of low-end EF4 damage. A debris ball was apparent on Doppler weather radar imagery by this time. The storm began producing EF5 damage at 2:38 p.m. CDT in northeastern Neshoba County. Tremendous ground scouring took place in the county, including in one field where the tornado dug a large trench into the ground, removing up to of soil in places. Grass was torn out by the roots and in clumps by suction vortices embedded within the tornado. Large trees were entirely uprooted, debarked, defoliated, and thrown up to as well. Maximum winds in the tornado were estimated at . The storm moved through the Pearl River Resort, where it destroyed a historic log cabin, fencing, lighting, and dugouts at two baseball fields. As the storm neared the edge of Neshoba County, the tornado emergency was extended to include northern Kemper County, southeastern Winston County, and all of Noxubee County. The tornado weakened briefly as it passed through the small community of Coy along the Neshoba‚ÄìKemper County line. Some trees took some extensive damage and a mobile home was destroyed. Upon leaving the community, the tornado intensified and produced EF5 damage again by 2:47 p.m. CDT. Throughout Neshoba County, the tornado damaged or destroyed 91 structures, leaving about 32 people homeless. Remains of a car wrapped around a tree. In Kemper County, a 3,000 sq-ft (280 m2) mini-mart was damaged beyond repair. Eleven people sought refuge inside the building's bathroom when the tornado struck; all escaped without injuries. Along the Kemper-Winston County line, EF5 damage occurred as extremely deep ground scouring took place again and asphalt was ripped from roads. On Green Road, a double-wide mobile home, anchored to the ground, was lofted and obliterated when it landed in a nearby tree line; debris from the home was scattered hundreds of yards farther. The survey team found no evidence of it having bounced or rolled from where it was picked up to where it impacted the tree line. All three occupants were killed, the sole fatalities from this tornado. Nearby, the tornado weakened to EF3 strength as two brick homes were destroyed with barely any interior walls left standing; two people sustained serious injuries. A well-built frame wood home was nearly swept clean off its foundation and two trailers were destroyed. Cars were hurled hundreds of yards, often bouncing along the way, and some were rendered almost unrecognizable and were wrapped around trees. Continuing through southeastern Winston County, the tornado weakened slightly to EF2 strength but continued to produce extensive tree and property damage. As it crossed Central McDonald Road, it destroyed a single-wide mobile home and leveled a nearby grove of pine trees. As the tornado approached the Winston‚ÄìNoxubee border, it caused substantial roof damage to a church and left impact holes in the back wall. Extreme tree damage was noted along the border as the tornado regained EF3 intensity. Along Butler Road, to the southwest of Macon, additional pavement scouring took place, along with the destruction of a shop and a bus being rolled. Thereafter, the tornado steadily weakened before dissipating roughly north of Mashulaville at 3:00 p.m. CDT. Throughout its 30-minute track, the tornado traveled almost , killed three people, injured eight others, and caused $1.1 million in damage. * * The supercell that produced this EF5 tornado later spawned an EF1 in northeastern Noxubee County at 3:18 p.m. CDT. The parent storm dissipated around 3:29 p.m. CDT as another supercell overtook it near the Mississippi‚ÄìAlabama state line. That cell produced an exceptionally long-lived EF4 that traveled nearly across Alabama. The Philadelphia tornado marked the first instance of an F5 or EF5 tornado in Mississippi since the March 3, 1966, Candlestick Park tornado. Following another EF5 that struck Smithville later on April 27, the outbreak marked the first known instance of two EF5 tornadoes on a single day in Mississippi. Aftermath Immediately following the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency for 39 counties. On April 29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29 Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April 15. This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60 members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May 17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April 15‚Äì28 storms.

Early life Ferguson was born in Dundee, Scotland, to Isabella (n√©e Maxwell) and John Ferguson. His family moved to Western Australia when he was an infant, where his father, a physician, was appointed colonial surgeon (the colony's chief medical officer). Ferguson was initially educated at Bishop Hale's School, and then sent back to Scotland to attend the High School of Dundee.

Business career In 1871, Ferguson acquired the lease of the Stanley Brewery. The following year, he went into partnership with William Mumme, a German expatriate with previous experience in the brewing trade. In 1874, the firm of Ferguson and Mumme acquired the Swan Brewery, which they relocated to the site of a freshwater spring at the foot of Mount Eliza. Ferguson sold his share in the brewery in 1886, and went into business as a general merchant in Fremantle, partnering with William Dalgety Moore. He established his own hardware business in 1889, and over the following years acquired interests in a number of saw mills in the South West. Politics and later life Ferguson entered politics in 1903, winning that year's North Fremantle state by-election, which had been caused by the resignation of Denis Doherty, the member for North Fremantle. His time in parliament was short-lived, however, as he was defeated by the Labour candidate, Harry Bolton. Ferguson remained involved in public life for some time, and was prominent in Perth's Presbyterian community.

Like his successor, Philo, he attempted to fuse ideas in the Hebrew Scriptures with those in Greek thought. History He lived in the third or 2nd century BC. The period of his life is doubtful : Alfred Gercke places him in the time of Ptolemy Lathyrus (latter part of 2nd century BC); reliable testimony indicates that he was a contemporary of Ptolemy Philometor (middle of 2nd century BC). Aristobulus was among many philosophers of his day who argued that the essentials of Greek philosophy and metaphysics were derived from Jewish sources. Philosopher Numenius of Apamea (2nd century CE) echoes this position in his well-known statement \\"What is Plato but Moses speaking Attic Greek?\\" (1.150.4) Aristobulus maintained, 150 years earlier than Philo, that not only the oldest Grecian poets, Homer, Hesod, Orpheus, etc., but also the most celebrated Greek thinkers, especially Plato, had acquired most of their wisdom from Jewish sages and ancient Hebrew texts (Gfrorer i. p. 308, also ii. 111-118) (Eusebius citing Aristobulus and Numenius Ev ix. 6, xi. 10). He was among the earliest of the Jewish Alexandrian philosophers whose aim was to reconcile and identify Greek philosophical conceptions with the Jewish religion. Only a few fragments of his work, apparently entitled Commentaries on the Writings of Moses, are quoted by Clement, Eusebius and other theological writers, but they suffice to show its object. Praeparatio Evangelica viii. 10, xiii. 12. has preserved two fair-sized fragments of it, in which are found all the quotations from Aristobulus made by Clement. In addition, there is extant a small passage concerning the time of the Passover festival, quoted by Anatolius.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica, vii. 32, 17. Incorrect or heterodox descriptions He is incorrectly named \\"Aristobulus of Paneas\\" in Rufinus' Latin translation of Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica (7, 32, 16). It is a wrong translation of the Greek ·ΩÅ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÖ, \\"the Great\\". In addition, the author here quoted by Eusebius, Anatolius of Laodicea (270 CE), was mistaken in believing that Aristobulus was one of the 70 priests who translated the Torah into Greek (the Septuagint) during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (3rd century BC). Anatolius of Laodicea incorrectly said that he lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus. A further mistake in Rufinus' Latin translation of the Anatolius fragment gave rise to the legend that Aristobulus was from Paneas, in the Golan Heights. He is the author of a book the exact title of which is not certain, although there is sufficient evidence to prove that it was an exposition of the Law of Moses. Aristobulus endeavoured to prove that early Greek philosophers had from Linus, Orpheus, Musaeus and others, passages which strongly resemble the Mosaic writings. It is suggested that the name Aristobulus was taken from . The hypothesisSchlatter, Das Neugefundene Hebr√§ische St√ºck des Sirach, 1897. that it was from Aristobulus that the philosophy of the Wisdom of Sirach was derived is not generally accepted.

He began working in art in 1975, immediately attracting a lot of interest among the most important Italian art critics and historians (Filiberto Menna, Maurizio Fagiolo dell‚ÄôArco, Enrico Crispolti, Marcello Venturoli, Lorenza Trucchi, Gabriele Simongini). He was considered a young master and one of the great Italian colourist painting. Protagonist in the '80s in European painting, De Liberato has had more than fifty solo exhibitions, including two in the prestigious \\"Art Basel\\", in 1983 and 1984. Since 1990 he has worked in his studio in the Italian province. All his work is created through research cycles. Since 1994 he has used a unique and very personal language, as well as authentic poetry that avoids fads and mannerist trends. In 2011 he was invited to the Italian Pavilion (Abruzzo) of the Venice Biennale. In 2012, one of his works, \\"RED\\", was chosen as an image of the Lincoln Center Festival in New York City, which gave to his work global renown. In 2011 he decided to end all links with Italian galleries and has worked exclusively for international outlets.

Biography Margaret \\"Daisy\\" Sutermeister was born in 1875 in Milton, Massachusetts, to Emmanuel Sutermeister and Harriet Georgianna Davenport. Her father, who was of Swiss descent, ran a commercial plant nursery and vegetable garden and was also a fireman. Her brother was chemist Edwin Sutermeister. She lived for most of her life in the Capen-Davenport-Sutermeister House on Canton Avenue, which had been built in 1781 and was located on the same property as the family nursery. After leaving school in 1894, Sutermeister took up photography using a glass plate camera to document everyday life in Milton and the surrounding area. Over the next 15 years, she shot a wide range of subjects: romantic landscapes, lively street scenes, scientific experiments, and portraits both formal and candid. Among the people she photographed are middle-class whites, African Americans, Gypsy vendors, farmhands, and Asian laundrymen. When her father died in 1909, she took over managing the family's Davenport Nursery and gave up photography. She died in 1951, and a year later the new owners of her house discovered her 1800 glass-plate negatives in a barn. They donated this archive of turn-of-the-century Massachusetts life to the Milton Historical Society. It was published in the early 1990s by art historian Judith Bookbinder and has formed the basis of a number of exhibitions since. Ten of Sutermeister's photographs are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.

He was a Manhattan Project scientist who worked at Columbia University to develop the first atomic bomb, and taught chemistry at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for 37 years. Eicher was the author of several chemistry publications and, with his son David J. Eicher, was coauthor of the reference book Civil War High Commands. In 2016, Eicher was elected by the State of Ohio to the class of 2016, Ohio Senior Citizens of the Year. He taught for Miami University's Institute for Learning and Retirement for many years, and was a teacher for 75 continuous year, with his first assistant teaching role in 1941 in a mineralogy class at Purdue University.  Early life and education The product of German, Swiss, and a small amount of Delaware Native American ancestry, Eicher was born in Dayton, Ohio. Eicher's father, Harold Ralph Eicher (1892‚Äì1968) was a sales manager and his mother, Myrtle Grace (n√©e Wetzel) Eicher (1894‚Äì1989) was a seamstress, public school teacher, and piano and organ teacher. Eicher attended Fairview Elementary School. Eicher organized a chemical laboratory at his home in Dayton, and practiced chemistry and all aspects of photography with a Leica camera. He studied chemistry at Fairview High School, where he was the laboratory assistant. There, he placed first in the 1938 district scholarship and fourth in Ohio. At Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, Eicher continued his chemistry studies, obtaining a B.S. degree in 1942. While an undergraduate, he prepared sulfamic acid, used in the preparation of various sulfa drugs at Johns Hopkins University; he collected scrap iron for the war effort. He served as laboratory assistant in mineralogy for the Purdue School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering. Career Moving to the Ohio State University in Columbus, Eicher helped in the preparation of aviation gasoline components such as triptane, a reference compound, which was sent to the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. He joined the American Chemical Society in 1943, later serving as an assistant secretary and as a councilor. In mid-1943 Eicher joined the Manhattan Project at Columbia University in New York, working first with Willard Libby (1908‚Äì1980), Nobel Laureate in 1960; then with Harold C. Urey (1893‚Äì1981), chair of the chemistry department and 1934 Nobel Laureate; with John R. Dunning (1907‚Äì1975), dean of engineering; and with Leslie R. Groves (1896‚Äì1970), major general, commanding the Manhattan Engineer District. There Eicher worked on the synthesis of fluorocarbons used as lubricants, as plastics such as Teflon. He then worked on pilot plant tests for the enrichment of uranium-235. Finally, Eicher spent two years along with colleague Albert L. Myerson (1919‚Äì2004) constructing and operating a gas viscosimeter used to study uranium hexafluoride at various temperatures and pressures, the data from which were used in the production of uranium isotopes at the large gaseous diffusion plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.Eicher, John H.: Analysis of Mixtures of Perfluoroethylcyclohexane and Perfluoro-n-heptane, Manhattan District Engineers, SAM Laboratories, Columbia University, New York, 1944;Eicher, John H.: \\"The Viscosity of Gaseous C616,\\" Manhattan District Engineers, Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corp., New York, 1945;Eicher, John H.: \\"The Determination of the Viscosity of Gaseous Uranium Hexafluoride by the Capillary Tube Method,\\" Manhattan District Engineers, A3825, New York, 1945;Myerson, Albert L., and John H.

He became a longtime chapter secretary for the Phi Lambda Upsilon national chemistry honorary, and a member of the research Society of the Sigma Xi. With colleague Alec Kelley (1923‚Äì2013), he founded a Unitarian fellowship which later became the Unitarian-Universalist Church of Lafayette, Indiana. Eicher then worked on the preparation of various nitro and oximino compounds to earn his Ph.D. in 1952.Eicher, John H.: \\"The Preparation of Some Cyclohexane Derivatives, and the Reaction of Alpha-halo Acids and Esters with Alkali Nitrites,\\" PhD. Dissertation, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, 1952. One of his dissertation advisors was Herbert C. Brown (1912‚Äì2004), 1979 Nobel Laureate. Eicher often visited with his friend Linus C. Pauling (1901‚Äì1994), who won two Nobel Prizes, one for chemistry in 1954 and the Peace Prize in 1962. Eicher joined the chemistry department at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1952, and he subsequently taught chemistry there for 37 years. In 1953 he organized a student and faculty liberal religious club at Miami which became a Unitarian Fellowship and later evolved into the Hopedale Unitarian-Universalist Community.  Personal life  On June 12, 1957, Eicher married Susan Ann Arne (1923‚Äì1983), a sociologist and legal secretary, in Sarasota, Florida. They had two children, Nancy Grace Eicher (1959‚Äì ), a journalist and editor, and David John Eicher (1961‚Äì ), astronomer and historian.

Synopsis The film explores the small but burgeoning community of LGBT Inuit people living in Nunavut, amidst the backdrop of the establishment of an LGBT Pride festival in the territorial capital of Iqaluit; the event took place just months after Iqaluit participated in the national campaign of raising and displaying the pride flag on public buildings for the duration of the 2014 Winter Olympics to protest anti-LGBT laws in Russia, which set off an extended territory-wide debate about the role of homosexuality in Inuit culture.\\"Gay in Nunavut: discovering a new language\\". Nunatsiaq News, September 26, 2014. The film explores various perspectives on the historical context of LGBT identity and sexuality among the Inuit, including the cultural and religious influence of the Roman Catholic Church on traditional Inuit spirituality and society. According to Inuit elders, the concepts of LGBT identity and long-term same- sex relationships were not known among the Inuit, but same-sex sexual activity was common and accepted ‚Äî particularly as a remedy for social and sexual isolation during the annual period when men and women were segregated from each other by the gender roles imposed by the traditional hunting season ‚Äî until Catholicism emerged as a dominant influence on Inuit society in the 1950s. Figures appearing in the film include filmmaker Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, politicians Jack Anawak and Paul Okalik, and activists Allison Brewer, Nuka Fennell and Jesse Mike. The film takes its name from the Inuktitut language words for lesbian and gay, which literally translate as \\"two soft things rubbing together\\" and \\"two hard things rubbing together\\", respectively.

As of the 2010 census the population was 61. Geography The community is located in southern Kossuth County, in the southeast part of Riverdale Township, south of Algona along US 169 very close to the Humboldt County line. It is north of Humboldt via US 169. Iowa Highway 408 leads east from St. Joseph to Lu Verne. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the St. Joseph CDP has an area of , all land. It is bordered to the east by the East Fork of the Des Moines River. History One of the earliest histories states \\"the town was never laid out, as far as the records show, but grew by evolution.\\" The settlement of St. Joseph was formerly known as \\"Hale\\". St. Joe began its official existence in 1865 when Oscar Hale, the first landowner of the area, started a post office and hotel. The new community then became known as Hale's post office or Hale. In 1870, George Hollenbeck came from Wisconsin and started a general store. Casper Waldbillig moved from Dubuque in 1878 and opened a saloon. One of the early settlers was John Devine, who owned a large herd of cattle and was nicknamed the \\"cattle baron\\". Many of the early family names are still found in the vicinity today. In 1871, Gregory Hollenbeck and Margaret Schreiber Hollenbeck donated land on which to build a church in Hale. Father Lenihan was the circuit pastor at that time, and the first church was built in 1872 at a cost of about $1,800. Since the town of St. Joe is small and unincorporated, the community's life and activities revolve almost entirely around their church and school. In 1996, the parish numbered 141 families. The parish school had 87 students attending grades K through 12.

Built in 1860 and overlooking Madison Square, it was one of the largest hotels on the avenue in its day. History Menu Albemarle Hotel was located in New York City at the junction of Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and 24th Street, facing Madison Square. Its location was convenient to theatres, churches, halls, clubs, and retail stores. It was opened by George D. Ives in 1860. Proprietors included Louis H. Janvrin and Henry Walter (d. 1903) who refitted and furnished it. The culinary department was under the management of a French chef, and the cuisine included the rarest of everything that the markets provided. Architecture and fittings The hotel was built of white marble, six stories in height. The interior appointments were luxurious. The plumbing and sanitary arrangements were under the supervision of the sanitary engineer, Charles T. Wingate. The offices, reception and dining rooms were frescoed and decorated, and connected with the floors above by spacious staircases and a safety passenger elevator. The accommodations served upwards of 150 guests. Many of the rooms were en suite, affording parlor, bedrooms and bathroom, all self-contained and luxuriously furnished. Many of these suites were permanently occupied by wealthy citizens. The Albemarle's halls and corridors were wide, while the rooms were handsomely furnished and elegant in their appointments, fixtures and upholstery. Demolition The hotel closed in the mid-1910s and along with the adjacent Hoffman House was replaced with a sixteen-story building in 1915.

They complete contracts to earn gold and glory. An inexperienced priestess joins her first adventuring party, but comes into danger after her first contract involving goblins goes wrong. As the rest of her party is wiped out, she is saved by a man known as Goblin Slayer, an adventurer whose only purpose is the eradication of goblins with extreme prejudice. Characters The characters in this story do not carry proper names but are named by their classes. ; : :The series' main character, an experienced silver ranked adventurer who only concerns himself with hunting , to the point where the Guild has awarded him a Specialist classification due to both the sheer amount of goblins that he has killed as well as his work in studying their habits and biology. The jobs he takes only involve goblins and he takes no others, though he often gets roped into more dire quests for reasons beyond his control. :He uses equipment that would seem lacking for an adventurer of his rank, and is often judged as unprofessional because of this. His choice of disheveled equipment serves a purpose, as his swords and armor are routinely broken. Expensive equipment would be wasted fighting goblins. He also reveals in volume four that he wears a magical ring that allows him to breathe underwater. Dwarf Shaman noted that his equipment is perfectly suited for taking on Goblins in their dark and cramped lairs. :His style of combat relies more on pragmatism such as setting traps, using a weapon against its user, and taking whatever advantage that may come. He even uses his own imagination to re-purpose a protection spell in order to kill all the goblins in a burning elven fortress. :His most defining trait is the hatred of goblins that drives him and his actions. His motivation is revenge, as his family and village were massacred by goblins, causing him to dedicate his life to the eradication of goblins everywhere. The sole survivor of the attack, he was soon taken in by Master who taught him the skills needed to kill goblins. :Five years later, he applied for the adventurers' Guild and was taken in by the uncle of his childhood friend, Cow Girl. He uses his income as an adventurer to pay for his stay. Though he is open to the idea of there being genuinely good goblins somewhere in the world, he believes that until proven otherwise, they can only be assumed to be evil due to the death and destruction they cause. ; : :The main female protagonist. She is initially a 15-year-old porcelain ranked adventurer, the lowest rank, as she had just joined. Her personality consists of being young, kind, and a generally helpful person. She is capable of performing healing magic, miracle of holy light, and protective spells with a high amount of proficiency. After her first goblin hunt rapidly goes downhill, she is saved by Goblin Slayer and joins him as a new party. Even after the horrifying events of her first quest, she still wishes to be an adventurer and help her party however she can. As she fights alongside Goblin Slayer, her proficiency with magic improves and she ranks up as an adventurer. Her backstory is that of an orphan raised in a temple into priesthood along with other orphans like her. ; : :Goblin Slayer's childhood best friend and a farm hand on her uncle's farm. Her uncle took her in his farm as an assistant at first, but adopted her after her and the Goblin Slayer's families were massacred by Goblins. She clearly cares deeply for Goblin Slayer, though he seems oblivious to the depths of her affection. ; : :A young woman who runs the Guild's front office as a receptionist and hands out contracts to adventurers. She shows concern for the villages pleading for help against the goblins, and is exasperated at how few experienced adventurers would take such jobs.

She holds great amounts of respect for Goblin Slayer, due to his willingness to take on many goblin contracts others would not touch, and eventually develops feelings for him. ; : :A 2000 year old adventurer of class. She came with Dwarf Shaman and Lizard Priest to find Goblin Slayer and recruit his help. They face some trouble early in the story as they are unable to pronounce \\"Goblin Slayer\\" and refer to him by other names (mostly Orcbolg and Beardcutter), until they find him. They reveal their objective; due to the increase in other demon monsters, there are not enough people to deal with goblins and the elf army cannot mobilize for mere goblins as it would create suspicion and panic. They wish to hire Goblin Slayer to help them kill goblins. She initially looks down on Goblin Slayer, due to his unkempt and weak appearance, but later comes to respect him, when she sees him in battle. She initially comes off as naive, believing that Goblin Slayer is an affront to the idea of an adventurer because he does not actually go on what she considers to be adventures. After their encounter with Ogre she comes to realize just how strong and brave Goblin Slayer is and becomes determined to make him go on a true adventure with her and the rest of their party. She is a light-weight when it comes to drinking. She is a Silver ranked adventurer. ; : :A 107 year old adventurer of class and party member with High Elf and Lizard Priest. He is a cheerful and happy person and is almost always arguing with High Elf Archer. As a Dwarf, he is good with metal, stone, and alcohol.

He is Silver ranked adventurer. ; : :A adventurer and party member with High Elf and Dwarf Shaman. Like Priestess, he can use healing magic, but he also uses a sword to fight and can summon skeletal familiars to assist him in battle. He often acts as a mediator between Dwarf and High Elf, stopping their arguments. He is a very calm and composed person. He cares deeply about nature due to his religion. He is also extremely enamored with the taste of cheese, which he finds exotic as his people do not raise livestock. His intention is to become a dragon. Like the dwarf and high elf he is also a Silver ranked adventurer. ; : :A sorceress who is an acquaintance of Goblin Slayer. She is Spearman's partner. She speaks very slowly, pausing between each word. She has enough magical power to not care about wasting it and even uses costly magic (due to it having a usage quota) just to light her pipe. ; : :A warrior who usually belittles Goblin Slayer for his habit of hunting only goblins despite being a Silver Rank adventurer. He is Witch's partner. He has a crush on Guild girl. Spearman has the reputation of being the strongest adventurer of the borderlands. ; : :One of the heroes who helped defeat the previous Demon Lord, and now the highest authority in Water Town, the 25-year- old Sword Maiden had no innate talents like the other heroes, so she developed and honed her abilities from scratch instead. She was blinded and raped by goblins after being captured by them once, and since then she has a deep fear of them, thus hiring Goblin Slayer and his friends to deal with goblins lurking under the city. She commands an alligator familiar which protects the city sewers from goblin attacks. She develops strong romantic feelings for Goblin Slayer. She is a gold ranked adventurer and the archbishop of Supreme God. ; : *Goblins: The primary antagonists of the series, vicious creatures that kill those who oppose them and rape women to reproduce.

Heindel created over 1300 paintings and drawings of dance and performing arts during a twenty-five year period in the late twentieth century. He was described as the best painter of dance of his time. Well-known patrons of dance and the performing arts collected Heindel's works and sponsored his exhibitions, including Princess Diana, Princess Margaret, Princess Caroline, Prince and Princess Takamado, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. His works are found in the permanent collections of museums including the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, London, the Norman Rockwell Museum, and the Glasgow Museums. Early life and career 330x330px Heindel was born in Toledo, Ohio, the oldest of three adopted sons, to working-class parents Charlotte and Robert Heindel. His mother worked at the local Willy's Jeep factory assembling carburetors. His father was an engineer and piano player. Heindel began painting at an early age, encouraged by his parents, though especially his mother who believed him to be gifted. Heindel enrolled at the Famous Artists School at 16, eventually becoming one of its most celebrated graduates. 85x85px Heindel married Rosalie (Rose) Petres in 1959. They had three sons: Toby (born February 28, 1960, died September 20, 1990), Troy (born December 1, 1961) and Todd (born September 7, 1966). Heindel often signed his paintings with the symbol of his wife Rose. During his 25-year illustration career Heindel was friends with and competed against the best illustrators of the late twentieth century, including Bob Peak, Bernie Fuchs, Mark English, Fred Otnes, and Alan E. Cober. Together, they created an annual educational event called the Illustrator's Workshop to teach young illustrators about the illustration business. Heindel reached the top of the illustration business in the early 1980s, his work having appeared in nearly every major print magazine such as ‚ÄòSports Illustrated‚Äô, ‚ÄòTV Guide‚Äô, ‚ÄòLadies Home Journal‚Äô, ‚ÄòRedbook‚Äô, the ‚ÄòSaturday Evening Post‚Äô, and ‚ÄòTime‚Äô magazine. Heindel's ‚ÄòTime‚Äô magazine cover of Daniel Ellsberg resides in the permanent collection of The Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. In 2011, he was posthumously inducted into the Illustrators Hall of Fame. While Heindel benefited from advances in photography and publishing, he foresaw the impact technology would ultimately have on the commercial illustration business. Heindel was known to comment to students that they needed to be prepared for a change in the illustration business, comparing 20th century illustrators to West Virginia coal miners. At the height of his illustration career in the 1980s, Heindel pivoted into fine art; instead of painting American football players for ‚ÄòSports Illustrated,‚Äô he began to paint dancers, something he had wanted to do since first seeing the Royal Ballet's Rudolph Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn dance ‚ÄòParadise Lost‚Äô in 1962.  Fine Art, Dance and Set Design  Sir Frederick Ashton, 1985, National Portrait Gallery, London At 44, Heindel was considered too old to be entering the world of fine art, access that was often controlled by established New York galleries. Heindel adopted a strategy of collaboration, study, and contemporaneous exhibition that would gain him access to the best dancers and performing arts companies around the world. Heindel would spend one to two years preparing for a major exhibition. Months before entering the studio to paint, he would partner with a ballet company, working closely with the artistic director, choreographer and principal dancers, observing and photographing rehearsals. Heindel rarely created images from final performances, preferring instead to paint dancers at rehearsal. After gathering material, Heindel would retreat to his studio in Easton, CT for six to nine months, creating studies and paintings, capturing the major themes of the performance. Exhibition of the paintings, 30 to 100 paintings and drawings, would take place at or near the performance venue at about the same time as the first performance. Anthony Dowell, artistic director of The Royal Ballet, said of Heindel's method: > Sometimes, during the weary hours of rehearsal, the last thing a dancer > needs is an intruder with a sketch book or camera recording all the trials > and secret worries that we all have whilst trying to accomplish the > impossible. Robert Heindel, apart from being one of the most courteous and > charming of men, manages to camouflage himself into the studio setting, > somehow hiding his ‚Äòspying‚Äô eyes. Many silent photos later, and after the > magic process has taken place in his studio, one is presented with not only > a true image of oneself but with a beautiful study and record of the private > moments that one thought had been hidden. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, Phantom of the Opera, 1986, private collection Heindel was commissioned in 1987 by Andrew Lloyd Webber to paint impressions from the musicals Cats and The Phantom of the Opera. thumb In 1996, Heindel had the opportunity to produce paintings from a Kabuki production. The occasion was a performance of the Kabuki dance Yasuna, performed by Onoe Kikugoro VII. The story of Yasuna, who loses his fianc√©e just before their marriage and then, insane with grief, wanders around the countryside in spring wearing her fiancee's silk kimono, touched the memory of the grief Heindel felt when he lost his son Toby six years before. \\"I‚Äôm always very interested,\\" Heindel said, \\"in cultural differences. My involvement with dance and the theater usually means I am driven into some creative activity. In Japanese culture, I am also most interested in dance. However, once I pursue any of the themes that grip us, like love or defeat, life or death, I feel almost no difference between the cultures.\\" Heindel tried to cast the world of Kabuki within the context of the universal themes that humankind shares and that go beyond East or West within the world of his own paintings.  Death  Heindel's studio, 2005, shortly after his death Robert Heindel died at his home in Guildford, Connecticut on July 3, 2005, after a 10-year struggle with emphysema. There were three unfinished dance paintings in his studio. Prior to his death, Heindel had commented that once he could no longer climb the stairs to his studio to paint, it would be time for him to leave Further reading * * Degawa, Hirokazu (2011).

The Theatrum Anatomicum or Leiden anatomical theatre was an anatomical theatre and cabinet of curiosities of Leiden University that opened in Leiden in the Netherlands in 1594. It was one of the first anatomical theatres in Europe. The theatre was started on the initiative of Pieter Pauw, then professor of anatomy at Leiden University. During winters, professors of anatomy held public dissections of cadavers to a fee paying audience of students and surgeons, but also curious members of the public. As there was no teaching in the summer, the theatre was used to display various curiosities including human and animal skeletons, ancient Egyptian mummies and Roman antiquities, and many other unusual objects from different parts of the world. As a result the theatre, at a time the only in Europe north of the alps, became a significant tourist attraction. By the 18th century the theatre became less used, and eventually became obsolete. The theatre finally closed in 1821. A modern reconstruction of this theatre can be seen in Museum Boerhaave in Leiden. The reconstruction at Rijksmuseum Boerhaave is based on manuscripts and prints from the Leiden anatomical theatre from 1610; the skeletons are of a more recent date. The University Room at Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden also features objects from the anatomical theatre. Collections originating in the theatre are also held in other Dutch museum collections.

L√ºne is the name of a location near the left lower reaches of the Elbe related to the Saxon campaign of Charlemagne in the year 795. Between 794 and 799, Charlemagne undertook the annual campaigns of the Saxon Wars to consolidate his conquests there. In May 795, however, the Obotrite Slavs, who expected the attack by Charlemagne, were the other side of the Elbe under the leadership of Witzlaus. Surprisingly, Charlemagne waited in vain as Witzlaus was killed by his own men while crossing the Elbe. Encamped, Charlemagne received emissaries of the leader of the Avars, offering submission and conversion to Christianity. It is reported that Heimrich, Count of Rheingau, son of Cancor, had fallen on 5 May 795 in L√ºne on the Elbe during the fight. Charlemagne remained at Aachen through July and afterwards held a national assembly (placitum) in Kostheim in Mainz.

He painted and made prints, and was influenced by German Expressionism as well as Surrealism. Biography Hagedorn was born on 26 January 1902 in Oakland, California, the son of Henry and Edna (n√©e Kafka) Hagedorn. His mother died in childbirth, and he was raised by his maternal grandmother and by his aunt, Grace Kafka. At the age of 16, he enrolled in the San Francisco Art Association, and from 1923 to 1926 attended the California School of Fine Arts. Around 1930 he may have moved to New York for a brief period. He participated in numerous exhibitions from the late 1920s through the 1930s, and won honors from the Pennsylvania Academy and the Brooklyn Museum. Despite these successes, he did not take advantage of offers from museum curators and art dealers that may have increased his fame. After receiving a substantial inheritance in the late 1930s, he stopped exhibiting his work publicly. In the catalog to a 1996 exhibition at the University of California, Berkeley, museum curator James Steward wrote: \\"The spirit went out of much of his work from about 1940, and although Hagedorn continued to make art throughout most of his life, it often devolved into trivializing depictions of the female nude.\\" He died on 14 December 1982 in Berkeley, California.

He serves as a member of the San Diego City Council representing City Council District 6. He is a Republican; although city council positions are officially nonpartisan per California state law. Early life and career Cate is the son of a California Highway Patrol officer originally from Kawit, Cavite, Philippines. His mother worked for the United States Postal Service. His parents divorced when he was a child; Cate described both parents as \\"very apolitical\\". According to the Southern California Community Press, Cate's family is of Spanish/Filipino heritage. Cate was raised in San Diego. He attended La Costa Canyon High School, graduating in 2000, then went to community college at MiraCosta and Palomar colleges. While in college, Cate and a friend started an auto glass repair business. After graduating from college at the University of San Diego, where he became interested in politics, Cate then interned at Jefferson Government Relations in Washington, D.C. Later he worked for Kevin Faulconer as a policy advisor. By 2011, Cate lived in Carlsbad, but moved to Mira Mesa a year later. Before being elected, Cate traveled to the Philippines for the first time, and later met with the Ambassador of the Philippines to the United States Jose Cuisia. In January 2016, Cate married Maria Cabuang.  San Diego City Council  Cate ran against three other opponents during the primary; and ran against Carol Kim during the general election. Cate was first elected to office in the 2014 election, the first election to use the new boundaries for this district following 2010 redistricting. District 6 includes the neighborhoods of Clairemont Mesa, Kearny Mesa, Mira Mesa, North Clairemont, and Rancho Pe√±asquitos. The redistricting effort included an effort by Asian Pacific Islanders to create a district that represented the inclusion of their more diverse population. When Cate took office, he was the first Asian American elected to the city council in several decades. In 2015, at the age of 32, Cate was the youngest serving city councilmember in San Diego. Cate is only the second Asian American to be elected to the San Diego City Council, the first being Tom Hom. In 2016, Cate received national attention as the Chargers attacked him for his opposition to Measure C, a ballot initiative to provide public funding for a new stadium for the team. The measure failed to achieve the two-thirds needed to pass, receiving less than a majority of the vote; Cate said of the vote \\"San Diego voters know a bad deal when they see it,\\". For his willingness to lead the opposition, the Voice of San Diego wrote positively of Cate. After the election, Cate supported an effort to lease the Qualcomm Stadium site for a dollar, but the Chargers instead decided in 2017 to relocate to Los Angeles. In his first year in office, Cate's district saw a growth of the brewing industry in his district, with part of it being called the \\"beer belt\\". In 2016, while other members of the city council were looking to ban vacation rentals, Cate advanced a proposal to allow for regulated vacation rentals. In February 2017, Cate supported tax reform for Internet taxes, in an effort to ensure the city was receiving a proportionate share of the state's internet tax revenue; Cate argues that with increase commerce online, the city is losing out funding for city services. According to the San Diego Office of the City Clerk, Cate is a member of the following committees and sub-committees: * Budget and Government Efficiency Committee ** Budget Review Committee * Environment Committee (Vice Chair) * Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee (Chair) * Rules Committee * Smart Growth and Land Use Committee * Select Committee on Homelessness = Controversies = In 2016, Cate was criticized in the San Diego Reader for accepting a five-thousand dollar donation from San Diego Gas & Electric for a charity event, which the paper claimed was an attempt to purchase influence.  2017 SoccerCity Memo Leak  In June 2017, Cate leaked a confidential 16-page memo regarding legal questions related to the SoccerCity initiative to the initiative's funders, FS Investors. San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott called the leak ‚Äúan egregious breach of public trust‚Äù. In October 2017, facing questions from a related lawsuit, Cate admitted he was the one to leak the memo, and that he would not resign. The California Attorney General was handed the case by the San Diego City Attorney. In December 2017, San Diego's Ethics Commission levied its maximum fine of $5,000 for the leak, which Cate paid. In 2018, Cate was informed that he would not face criminal charges.

It has been driven by increasing competition for scarce tenure-track faculty positions, leading to more people resident in postdoctoral positions for a longer time. Unions often challenge the low pay, minimal benefits, and lack of job security that are typical of postdoctoral positions. Unionizing is however sometimes seen as creating a culture clash of tension between postdocs and their academic advisors, and some question the suitability of a union for a temporary position. Some universities seek to avoid pushes for unionization by proactively addressing the concerns of postdoctoral researchers. Postdoctoral unions exist only at a few universities. They have often been formed with the help of other unions at the same institution; for example, before the University of Massachusetts Amherst union was formed, postdoctoral researchers were the only class of employees not already part of a union. The National Postdoctoral Association, which is a professional association rather than a labor union, is officially neutral on the issue of postdoctoral unionization.  History  The first stand-alone postdoctoral researcher union was UAW Local 5810 at the University of California system. As of 2010 it represented about 6,400 postdoctoral researchers, which was estimated to be about 10% of the United States total, and is the largest postdoctoral researcher union in North America. Efforts to form this union had begun in the early 2000s, and it was officially formed in 2008. Its first contract was ratified in August 2010, leading to the institution of a minimum salary with annual increases, availability of insurance benefits, guaranteed vacation time, paid maternity leave, and just cause protections for discipline or dismissal. Postdocs at Rutgers University unionized in July 2009. In 2010, a postdoctoral union at the University of Massachusetts Amherst was formed, and in 2012 it ratified a contract providing for salary and benefits, the first of its kind in the University of Massachusetts system. Postdoctoral unions also exist at the University of Connecticut Health Center and the University of Alaska in the United States, and at McMaster University, the University of Western Ontario, and the Universit√© Laval in Canada. In 2018, the 1,100 postdocs at the University of Washington voted to unionize, becoming the second-largest postdoc union in the United States. Also in 2018, postdocs at Columbia University formed the first certified postdoctoral union at a private university in the United States after successfully petitioning the NLRB, and the postdocs at the University of Connecticut formed a union.

Built in 1807, it is one of the rural community's oldest surviving buildings, and has long been a landmark on what was once the main road between Augusta and Portland. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It was owned by the state, forming part of Peacock Beach State Park, but has been privately owned by Christine and Christopher Faris since 1993. Description and history The Peacock Tavern stands on the east side of US 201 in rural Richmond, opposite the entrance to Peacock Beach State Park. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboard siding. It is seven bays wide, with a typical five-bay facade augmented by asymmetrically placed windows to the left. The front entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a decorative carved entablature and dentillated cornice. The interior contains well-preserved but simple Federal period woodwork, including wood paneling, fireplace mantels, and wainscoting. The main stair's newel post is a 20th-century reproduction. The tavern was built in 1807, along what was historically the main road leading south from Augusta. It was built by Benjamin Shaw, but sold soon afterward to Edward Peacock, from whom it acquired its name. The two-bay ell, which extends the building to the left and rear, was added later in the 19th century.

A biological rule or biological law is a generalized law, principle, or rule of thumb formulated to describe patterns observed in living organisms. Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the ecology and biogeographical distributions of plant and animal species around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them. From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In his biology, Aristotle inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing tetrapods (in modern terms, terrestrial placental mammals). Among his rules were that brood size decreases with adult body mass, while lifespan increases with gestation period and with body mass, and fecundity decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation. Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as models to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of Karl Ernst von Baer (from 1828 onwards) on embryonic development, and of Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger on animal pigmentation, in 1833. There is some scepticism among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book Biogeography and Plate Tectonics, comments that while Willi Hennig's rules on cladistics \\"have generally been helpful\\", his progression rule is \\"suspect\\". List of biological rules Bergmann's rule states that body mass increases with colder climate, as here in Swedish moose. * Allen's rule states that the body shapes and proportions of endotherms vary by climatic temperature by either minimizing exposed surface area to minimize heat loss in cold climates or maximizing exposed surface area to maximize heat loss in hot climates. It is named after Joel Asaph Allen who described it in 1877. * Bateson's rule states that extra legs are mirror-symmetric with their neighbours, such as when an extra leg appears in an insect's leg socket. It is named after the pioneering geneticist William Bateson who observed it in 1894. It appears to be caused by the leaking of positional signals across the limb-limb interface, so that the extra limb's polarity to be reversed. * Bergmann's rule states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic clade, populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions. It applies with exceptions to many mammals and birds. It was named after Carl Bergmann who described it in 1847. * Cope's rule states that animal population lineages tend to increase in body size over evolutionary time. The rule is named for the palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope. * Deep- sea gigantism, noted in 1880 by Henry Nottidge Moseley, states that deep-sea animals are larger than their shallow-water counterparts. In the case of marine crustaceans, it has been proposed that the increase in size with depth occurs for the same reason as the increase in size with latitude (Bergmann's rule): both trends involve increasing size with decreasing temperature.Dollo's law of irreversibility asserts that once an organism has evolved in a certain way, it will not return exactly to a previous form. * Dollo's law of irreversibility, proposed in 1893 by French-born Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo states that \\"an organism never returns exactly to a former state, even if it finds itself placed in conditions of existence identical to those in which it has previously lived ... it always keeps some trace of the intermediate stages through which it has passed.\\" * Eichler's rule states that the taxonomic diversity of parasites co-varies with the diversity of their hosts. It was observed in 1942 by Wolfdietrich Eichler, and is named for him.Emery's rule states that insect social parasites like cuckoo bumblebees choose closely related hosts, in this case other bumblebees. * Emery's rule, noticed by Carlo Emery, states that insect social parasites are often closely related to their hosts, such as being in the same genus. * Foster's rule, the island rule, or the island effect states that members of a species get smaller or bigger depending on the resources available in the environment.Juan Luis Arsuaga, Andy Klatt, The Neanderthal's Necklace: In Search of the First Thinkers, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2004, , , p. 199.Jean-Baptiste de Panafieu, Patrick Gries, Evolution, Seven Stories Press, 2007, , , p 42. The rule was first stated by J. Bristol Foster in 1964 in the journal Nature, in an article titled \\"The evolution of mammals on islands\\". * Gause's law or the competitive exclusion principle, named for Georgy Gause, states that two species competing for the same resource cannot coexist at constant population values. The competition leads either to the extinction of the weaker competitor or to an evolutionary or behavioral shift toward a different ecological niche. * Gloger's rule states that within a species of endotherms, more heavily pigmented forms tend to be found in more humid environments, e.g. near the equator. It was named after the zoologist Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger, who described it in 1833. * Haldane's rule states that if in a species hybrid only one sex is sterile, that sex is usually the heterogametic sex. The heterogametic sex is the one with two different sex chromosomes; in mammals, this is the male, with XY chromosomes. It is named after J.B.S. Haldane. * Hamilton's rule states that genes should increase in frequency when the relatedness of a recipient to an actor, multiplied by the benefit to the recipient, exceeds the reproductive cost to the actor. This is a prediction from the theory of kin selection formulated by W. D. Hamilton. * Harrison's rule states that parasite body sizes co-vary with those of their hosts. He proposed the rule for lice, but later authors have shown that it works equally well for many other groups of parasite including barnacles, nematodes, fleas, flies, mites, and ticks, and for the analogous case of small herbivores on large plants. * Hennig's progression rule states that when considering a group of species in cladistics, the species with the most primitive characters are found within the earliest part of the area, which will be the center of origin of that group. It is named for Willi Hennig, who devised the rule. * Jordan's rule states that there is an inverse relationship between water temperature and meristic characteristics such as the number of fin rays, vertebrae, or scale numbers, which are seen to increase with decreasing temperature. It is named after the father of American ichthyology, David Starr Jordan.Lack's principle matches clutch size to the largest number of young the parents can feed * Lack's principle, proposed by David Lack, states that \\"the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food\\". * Rapoport's rule states that the latitudinal ranges of plants and animals are generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. It was named after Eduardo H. Rapoport by G. C. Stevens in 1989. * Rensch's rule states that, across animal species within a lineage, sexual size dimorphism increases with body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases as body size increases when the female is the larger sex. The rule applies in primates, pinnipeds (seals), and even-toed ungulates (such as cattle and deer). It is named after Bernhard Rensch, who proposed it in 1950. * Schmalhausen's law, named after Ivan Schmalhausen, states that a population at the extreme limit of its tolerance in any one aspect is more vulnerable to small differences in any other aspect. Therefore, the variance of data is not simply noise interfering with the detection of so-called \\"main effects\\", but also an indicator of stressful conditions leading to greater vulnerability. * Thorson's rule states that benthic marine invertebrates at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to pelagic (often planktotrophic [plankton-feeding]) and widely dispersing larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring, often by viviparity or ovoviviparity, which are often brooded.Thorson, G. 1957 Bottom communities (sublittoral or shallow shelf).

Marine Biology 19: 193-213 * Van Valen's law states that the probability of extinction for species and higher taxa (such as families and orders) is constant for each group over time; groups grow neither more resistant nor more vulnerable to extinction, however old their lineage is. It is named for the evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen. * von Baer's laws, discovered by Karl Ernst von Baer, state that embryos start from a common form and develop into increasingly specialised forms, so that the diversification of embryonic form mirrors the taxonomic and phylogenetic tree. Therefore, all animals in a phylum share a similar early embryo; animals in smaller taxa (classes, orders, families, genera, species) share later and later embryonic stages. This was in sharp contrast to the recapitulation theory of Johann Friedrich Meckel (and later of Ernst Haeckel), which claimed that embryos went through stages resembling adult organisms from successive stages of the scala naturae from supposedly lowest to highest levels of organisation. * Williston's law, first noticed by Samuel Wendell Williston, states that parts in an organism tend to become reduced in number and greatly specialized in function. He had studied the dentition of vertebrates, and noted that where ancient animals had mouths with differing kinds of teeth, modern carnivores had incisors and canines specialized for tearing and cutting flesh, while modern herbivores had large molars specialized for grinding tough plant materials.

He was the second son of the Quaker Thomas Dimsdale, a Hertfordshire physician, banker and MP and was educated at Eton School. After travelling with his father to St Petersburg in 1768 to inoculate Catherine the Great and her son Grand Duke Paul against smallpox, he, along with his father, received an annuity and was created Baron Dimsdale of the Russian Empire. On his return he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating with an MB in 1771. He returned to Russia with his father in 1781 to carry out further inoculations within the Russian royal family. He became a partner in the family bank of Baron Dimsdale, Sons, Barnard and Staples established by his father. When his father retired in 1790 he succeeded to his father's Parliamentary seat for Hertford, holding it until 1802. In 1805 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. By then he was not in good health and died on a trip for his heath to Brighton in 1811. He was unmarried and left his estate to his sister Ann Dimsdale.

Under the totality of the circumstances test, courts focus \\"on all the circumstances of a particular case, rather than any one factor\\"., Totality of circumstances test (Accessed March 2, 2016). In the United States, totality tests are used as a method of analysis in several different areas of the law.Compare Timothy N. Trop, The Evolution of the Totality of the Circumstances Test for Willful Infringement, 27 IDEA 241, 250 (1987) (discussing the use of totality tests to determine whether a patent was willfully infringed upon) with David Allen Peterson, Criminal Procedure: Totality of the Circumstances Test for Determining Probable Cause Applied to Informer's Tips, 23 437, 451 (1984) (discussing the use of totality tests \\"for determining probable cause based upon an informer's tip\\"). For example, in United States criminal law, a determination about reasonable suspicion or probable cause is based on a consideration of the totality of the circumstances.Kit Kinports, Probable Cause and Reasonable Suspicion: Totality Tests or Rigid Rules? 163 75, 75 (2014) (citing Illinois v.

Gates, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the Fourth Amendment‚Äôs suspicion requirements ‚Äî the probable cause required to arrest and search, the reasonable suspicion needed to stop and frisk ‚Äî are totality-of-the- circumstances tests.\\"). Description Cathy E. Moore described the totality of the circumstances test as a \\"balancing approach\\" rather than a strict application of \\"analytical and evidentiary rules\\",Cathy E. Moore, Fourth Amendment ‚Äî Totality of the Circumstances Approach to Probable Cause Based on Informant's Tips, 74 1249, 1255 (1983). and Michael Coenen wrote that a totality of the circumstances test is the \\"antithesis\\" of an \\"inflexible checklist\\".Michael Coenen, Rules Against Rulification, 124 644, 647 (2014) (internal quotations omitted). Likewise, Kit Kinports has described the totality of the circumstances test as an analytical framework where decision makers are not bound by \\"rigid\\" rules, but instead are free to consider a range of evidence when making decisions.Kit Kinports, Probable Cause and Reasonable Suspicion: Totality Tests or Rigid Rules? 163 75, 75 (2014). John Barker Waite also contrasted the totality of the circumstances test against rigid rules; he wrote that a judge's determination about a defendant's guilt will always be based on their reactions \\"to the totality of the circumstances\\", and the basis for such determinations cannot be \\"reduced to rule\\".John Barker Waite, Law of Arrest , 24 279, 306 (1945‚Äì1946) (\\"What constitutes reasonable ground for a peace officer, or a private person, to believe that a felony has been committed by the arrestee has never been reduced to rule, and could not be.

History As early as 1937, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a totality test should be used to determine whether an individual qualifies as a \\"farmer\\" under United States bankruptcy law.First Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Bridgeport, Conn. v. Beach, (\\"In every case the totality of the facts is to be considered and appraised.\\"). In its 1983 decision in Illinois v.

Moore, Fourth Amendment ‚Äî Totality of the Circumstances Approach to Probable Cause Based on Informant's Tips, 74 1249, 1249 (1983). Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice William Rehnquist explained that a totality test was superior to a bright line rule because magistrates would not be \\"restricted in their authority to make probable cause determinations\\".Gates, 462 U.S. at 420. In its 2013 ruling in Florida v. Harris, the Supreme Court affirmed that \\"lower court judges must reject rigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries in favor of a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\\"Michael Coenen, Rules Against Rulification, 124 644, 647 (2014) (internal quotations omitted) (citing Florida v. Harris, 133 S. Ct. 1050, 1055‚Äì56 (2013)). However, some scholars have suggested that the Supreme Court's recent rulings in Florida v. Harris and Prado Navarette v. California represent a departure from the Court's prior totality test jurisprudence by introducing \\"drug-dog and drunk-driving exceptions to the totality-of-the- circumstances approach.\\"Kit Kinports, Probable Cause and Reasonable Suspicion: Totality Tests or Rigid Rules? 163 75, 86‚Äì87 (2014) (\\"Florida v.

The train consisted of engine number 2941, baggage cars 2570 and 2535, and horse car 2312. Background The train originated in New York City at 3:00 a.m. All three cars were loaded with New York newspapers destined for upstate New York from Albany to Buffalo and Canada. The train had left Albany at 6:05 a.m. and was instructed to reach Syracuse within three hours, including stops in Schenectady, Fonda, Herkimer and Utica. The train was also instructed to reduce speed in three locations - Amsterdam, Little Falls, and Rome. The train was run by engineer Robert Lilly, fireman Thomas Connolly, and conductor George Erhardt. Lilly was an experienced engineer on freight trains. Accident The accident happened approximately east of the Little Falls train station where the tracks run parallel to the north shore of the Mohawk River, on the Gulf Curve, the sharpest curve in the New York Central system, a six to seven degree bend. After negotiating approximately 75% of the curve, the engine derailed and crossed two of the parallel tracks and went down an embankment landing on its side. The first baggage car also went over the embankment. The tender and second baggage car derailed but remained on the rail right-of-way, blocking the other tracks. The last car remained on its track. Engineer Lilly (age 48) was killed instantly by decapitation and fireman Connolly (age 25) died from a broken neck and skull injuries shortly after being removed from the wreckage. Four newspaper messengers were injured. The two most seriously injured were the only occupants of the destroyed baggage car. They believed they survived only by being cushioned by bundles of newspapers, and were treated at the Little Falls hospital. The engine and second baggage car were damaged but not seriously and could be repaired. The other derailed baggage car was destroyed. All three set of tracks involved were forced out of service due to twisted rails and damaged ties. Another train was sent and the newspapers were delivered with a two-hour delay. Cause Inspection of the track and equipment found no contributing defects. The track was \\"in perfect surface and alignment\\". The braking gear on the engine was in working order. The engine and tender had undergone routine maintenance the prior May. The engine's throttle was observed after the accident as being \\"wide open\\". The train passed a signal tower at St. Johnsville, east of the crash site, four minutes before derailing. From the distance, the train's speed at the time was calculated to be at least per hour. According to the survivors, the train was approximately 15 minutes behind schedule and the engineer was trying to make up time. The train left the track due to excessive speed on the curve. The conductor stated that the train did not reduce speed upon approaching the curve. Although there was no speed limit on the curve, most engineers did use braking to slow the train when rounding the curve. After the accident, a per hour speed limit was put in place. Second Gulf Curve crash The much more deadly Little Falls Gulf Curve crash of 1940 occurred on the same spot killing 31.

Built in the late nineteenth century, it was the first post office building in the city to be owned by the United States federal government. The John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse now stands on its former site.  History  The Post Office and Sub-Treasury Building was designed to provide a permanent Boston office for the United States Postal Service, which had spent the early part of the nineteenth century repeatedly moving between various downtown locations in the city. Efforts to build a proper post office building in Boston had begun during the administration of President Millard Fillmore, but these met with little success until 1867, when Andrew Johnson approved a joint resolution by the United States Congress for appointing a commission to determine a site for the structure. In 1868 a site was selected and Congress made an appropriation for purchase of the land, and groundbreaking took place in the following year. The ceremony for laying the cornerstone took place in 1871, by which time the first floor of the building was already nearly complete, and was attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and members of the United States Cabinet. Construction of the building was temporarily interrupted by the Great Boston Fire of November 9-10, 1872, which destroyed a significant portion of downtown Boston. The still-incomplete building, which stood at the very edge of the burnt district, survived due to the use of fireproof materials during development, but suffered $175,000 of damages as a result of the blaze. Soon afterward, the government bought up several adjacent plots destroyed by the fire and decided to undertake a significant expansion of the structure, increasing its size to the entire block between Milk, Congress, Water and Devonshire Streets. The originally-planned portion of the building was completed in late 1874, and the postal service moved there from its temporary headquarters in the Old South Meeting House on December 19. At the same time, an open space on Congress Street side of the building, formed by the expansion of the city streets in the aftermath of the fire, was named Post Office Square in recognition of the new structure. Construction of the expansion phase took several more years and only ended in 1885, by which time the total cost of the building had exceeded $6 million.; ; . The completed building, which was designed by Supervising Architect Alfred B. Mullett and revised by William Appleton Potter, was built in the Second Empire style with Cape Ann granite and a prominent Mansard roof. Similar in appearance to both Old City Hall and the later Suffolk County Courthouse, it became one of several edifices that made Post Office Square a center of Victorian architecture in the late nineteenth century.; ; ; . The first floor of the building was largely occupied by the postal service, while the upper stories were taken up by various other federal agencies and officials, including the Bureau of Internal Revenue, United States Lighthouse Board and the Signal Service. The third floor acted as the home of the United States circuit and district courts for Massachusetts. By the early twentieth century, the space requirements of the federal government had outgrown the existing building, which had also become an object of derision in the face of a modernist backlash against Second Empire architecture. Following the passage of the Public Buildings Act in 1926, a campaign began for the building to be replaced with a larger and more modern structure. An appropriation for the project was filed in 1927 and approved, and in 1928 the various federal agencies moved out of the building. In the following year it was demolished, and four years later it was replaced with the new United States Post Office, Courthouse, and Federal Building. Two large statuaries by Daniel Chester French which formerly stood on top of the building are now located in Franklin Park. These were preserved during the demolition and were subsequently gifted to the city of Boston.

He inherited the County of Stein (Kamnik in Upper Carniola), and expanded his domains to the Windic March through marriage. He died childless, and his vast possessions were eventually inherited by his niece Agnes of Merania. Life He was the second son of Berthold IV, Duke of Merania and Agnes of Rochlitz, daughter of Dedi III, Margrave of Lusatia of the House of Wettin. After the death of his father in 1204, Henry took over the dignity of Margrave of Istria-Krain and the possessions situated south of the Danube. In Istria itself, the Republic of Venice made life so hard, they virtually dominated the peninsula. The policies of their Doge, Enrico Dandolo, had left a powerful mark on the region. And as trade and influence spread towards Venice, Istria grew weaker. Earlier in 1207, Henry II married Sophie, daughter and heir of Count Albert of Weichselburg (died 1209) in modern Slovenia, in which the Andechs spent huge wealth in the Windic March. The marriage would remain childless. Then, in 1208, he had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time: he became complicit in the murder of King Philip of Swabia, after the wedding of his oldest brother, Otto I, Duke of Merania and his bride Beatrice II, Countess of Burgundy at Bamberg, the seat of his second eldest brother, Ekbert, Bishop of Bamberg and the one who presided over the wedding. Today this incident is regarded a disgrace on the part of the House of Wittelsbach, but the rapid decline in support of the house of Andechs saw Henry II and Bishop Ekbert lose all rights, properties, dignities and revenues and had to flee to their sister, Gertrude, Queen of Hungary, in Hungary in 1209 for safety. In 1211, Ekbert could return to his possessions, but Henry II could only regain the Windic March; while his Tyrolean and Bavarian possessions remained lost to him. Although he had a connection with Aquileia ‚Äì his younger brother Berthold was Patriarch there from 1218 to 1251 ‚Äì and Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, he was mainly limited as a privateer on his and Sophie's possessions in later Lower Styria and Krain. In 1220, he was \\"allowed\\" participation as a witness in the confirmation of the grant of his former Mark to Berthold. In May 1228, an agreement between Henry II and Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria, whom had taken his most of his possessions, was made. Some of his lands and rights were returned, but then in July, death suddenly overtook him in Windischgraz. He was buried in Die√üen Abbey. His old Bavarian possessions were probably inherited by his brother Otto, while the Weichselburg lands remained shortly with Sophie.

Dat Boi is an Internet meme originating from the clip art website Animation Factory. The meme garnered popularity on Tumblr in 2015 before gaining more recognition through Twitter in 2016. It is usually accompanied by a person saying \\"here come dat boi\\" to which they reply \\"o shit waddup!\\"  History  According to Animation Factory employee Ryan Hagen, the frog GIF used in the meme was created by designer Josh Doohen. Before becoming an Internet meme, the image was used in AP Physics 1 Essentials, a textbook published in 2013. The meme's name originates from an edited news screenshot and the line of text often used in association with the image (\\"here come dat boi! o shit waddup!\\") was taken from a different meme featuring a computer- animated Pac-Man character. The frog image and its caption were first put together on Facebook, according to Vox. The Verge writer Chris Plante referred to the caption in a June article, stating that the Dat Boi image itself was \\"not enough\\" and should be paired with the caption. In May 2016, the \\"here come dat boi!\\" caption came under criticism after various Facebook users claimed to find it an \\"appropriation of African-American Vernacular English\\". As a result, certain Facebook groups discouraged use of the meme. Dat Boi was featured in The Guardian \\"Month in Memes\\" article for June 2016. Matt Furie, creator of Pepe the Frog, explained in a June 2016 interview with Comic Book Resources that he was \\"devastated\\" to find out that Dat Boi had \\"begun to overshadow Internet Pepe\\".

Built in 1883, it is a fine example of Queen Anne architecture, supposedly the city's first example of the style. It was built by Moses Coburn Foster, a well-known builder in the state, as his private residence. Moses owned M.C. Foster & Son, general contractors and builders. An advertisement for the business lists its location as 7 Park Place, which was the home built for his son, Herbert Foster. Herbert died at 38 years old. Herbert's home is as unique as Moses' but has not been restored, but instead, turned into two apartments. Moses was born in Newry in 1827. His father, Benjamin Foster, was a Methodist minister for fifty years. His mother was Lovisa Coburn of Tyngsboro, Massachusetts. Moses married in 1849 Francina Smith of Bethel, Maine. Foster built the Grand Trunk Railroad at Island Pond; the Calvary Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.; the addition of the Maine State House; post-offices at Houlton, Skowhegan, and Bangor; the East Maine Insane Asylum and Maine Central Station at Brunswick; and many churches (Bethel, Andover, Rumford and Houlton). (American Series of Popular Biographies, pages 274-276). 8 Park Place became the home to Carrie Foster Redington, daughter of Moses and teacher before her marriage at the Mill Street Primary School (according to the 1887 Waterville Directory), and her husband, Frank Redington, a businessman, city mayor and civic leader. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014 after nomination by its current owner, Nancy J. Williams, a native of Savannah, Georgia. Nancy purchased the house July 2, 2012 while still working as the Executive Director of Lake George Land Conservancy in Bolton Landing, NY. She moved to the house from Queensbury, NY, around January of 2016. Major projects completed by Nancy included shingling the roof, removal of knob and tube wiring, replacement with modern wiring, restoration of the front porch's steps and upper spindles, restoration of the master bedroom's ceiling, and restoration of rooms to their original condition of between 1883-1910. Bruce and Amy Bernard, the previous owners, had replaced rotting shingles on the lower level with accurate copies, rebuilt a rear chimney and remodeled the kitchen and bathrooms. Description and history The Foster-Redington House stands in central Waterville, at the end of Park Place, a spur projecting north from the mainly residential Park Street. Moses Foster had earlier built or lived in a house on Park Street which abutted (more recently named Veteran's Park), then a cemetery. That house is no longer extant. 8 Park Place is a two-story wood frame structure, with asymmetrical massing typical of the Queen Anne period. It has several projecting gable sections, and a square turret at the front corner, partially overhanging a single-story porch. The exterior is finished in a combination of decorative shingles and wooden clapboards, with some applied Stick style woodwork and vergeboard. The original carriage shed is attached but lost its corner, diagonal entrance from a fire. The interior has retained some of its original features, most notably the entrance hallway with formal fireplace and \\"mahogany woodwork\\" and stairs. The original kitchen, now the dining room, had faux-oak cabinets that were moved to a newly constructed hallway made by partitioning off the old kitchen with built-in cabinets with glass doors. The tin ceilings, chandeliers, and fluted Doric columns in the opening between the parlor and library were most likely added by Carrie and Frank Redington in a remodeling of the home, possibly as late as 1906, after the death of Moses Foster. Frank owned a furniture store on Silver Street where he was found dead on February 14, 1923, by a gun wound to his head, reported as self-inflicted. A newspaper reported that Frank had been ill for many years. While President of the Waterville Board of Trade and mayor of the city, Frank pushed vigorously to build a new city hall. Many of the larger industries in the city, including Lockwood Company, fought the project. After seven years the matter was finally settled by the Maine Supreme Court after fourteen months of deliberation. Frank also worked to secure $250,000 for the construction of the Federal Post Office on the corner of Main and Elm Streets, now sadly in disrepair. While mayor, land for the \\"Gilman Street\\" high school was purchased and its construction began. Carrie lived another thirty years in the house, dying December 24, 1953. .

Displaced persons who were unable to travel by boats or canoe arrived on foot, with their possessions wrapped up in plastic sheets, and dragging their bundles behind them with a rope. Foot travel was considered cheaper, but more dangerous, due to poisonous snakes and crocodiles in the swamps. Much of Nyal Town remained deserted \\"for weeks\\" after the fighting ended. Burned huts were empty, and fallen soldiers of pro-government forces remained unburied.Moran, Benedict.

In early December 2015, an area commissioner for SPLM-IO said that the humanitarian conditions in Nyal were \\"horrific,\\" and that civilians fleeing fighting in other counties were arriving in Nyal payam.

As of December 2015, Relief Web stated that the number of displaced persons in the Nyal area was 6,000 to 10,000 people.

There were few \\"humanitarian actors\\" in the area. According to this report, most local residents and that IDPs in the islands stated they were not receiving supplies from relief organizations. A March 2016 report estimates that over 50,000 people have now arrived in Nyal to escape the two years of fighting, in which scorched-earth tactics, atrocities, and sexual violence were used against civilian population. A Human Rights Watch spokesperson states that \\"massive rape, forced marriage, and abduction of women and girls\\" has occurred, and believes that \\"the scale of sexual violence in Unity State since mid-2015 has been shocking and may be unprecedented.\\" As of April 2016, coverage of Nyal Town has been lacking in mainstream news sources.

Samuel Schmelke Rokea·∏•.Introduction to Beit Yi·∫ì·∏•ak, Ora·∏• ·∏§ayyim, Przemysl, 1875 He was the head of the rabbinical court in Lviv from 1869-1893. His Beit Yi·∫ì·∏•ak (6 vols., 1875‚Äì1908), on the four parts of the Shul·∏•an Arukh, was widely acclaimed. His opinion on halakhic questions was sought by many prominent contemporary scholars. Biography A pupil of Joseph Saul ha-Levi Nathanson, head of the local bet din, Schmelkes was hailed in his youth as a brilliant talmudic student. He served as head of the bet din in a number of towns before being appointed in Lemberg, where he remained until his death. Intellectual Property Dating back to 1518 with the invention of the printing press, rabbinic authorities have issued exclusive printing privileges. These privileges typically grant the printer an exclusive right to print the book for a period of ten to twenty years or until the first edition has been sold‚Äîa time suitable for the author or heirs to have recovered their investment in preparing the manuscript for publication. In the 19th century, after the introduction of copyright in contemporary secular law, rabbinic authorities argued over the application of copyright in Jewish law. According to Schmelkes' teacher Rabbi Nathanson, a copyright was a property right arising out of the right of ownership. Schmelkes argued that an author‚Äôs exclusive right to publish their manuscript derived from the author's copyright in secular law, not from the author's property right in controlling access to the physical manuscript. Rabbi Schmelkes position is held by the majority in contemporary arguments over intellectual property in rabbinic law. Electricity on Shabbat For appliances that do not produce light on Shabbat, turning on an electric current may violate other prohibitions in rabbinic Jewish law. For example, the Talmud prohibits the creation of a fragrant scent in one's clothing on Shabbat because, according to Rashi \\"creating anything new\\" is prohibited under a Rabbinic category called molid. Rabbi Schmelkes suggested applying molid to the generating of electric current. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and many others disagree with this application. Among other reasons, they state that molid is a limited category that cannot be expanded past the definitions the Talmudic Sages imposed.Rabbi Michael Broyde & Rabbi Howard Jachter, The Use of Electricity on Shabbat and Yom Tov, part II, section A.

According to Staffing Industry Analysts, it is among the \\"largest marketing/creative staffing firms in the United States\\". Aquent also operates internationally with offices in Japan, Canada, Australia, France, UK, and the Netherlands. History Harvard College students John Chuang, Mia Wenjen and Steve Kapner in 1986 founded a typesetting business called Laser Designs from their Harvard dorm. The business grew and they added temporary staffing related to Mac training as an offering and called it MacTemps. MacTemps grew, adding non-Mac as well as permanent placements. With MacTemps no longer reflecting the business, they changed their name to Aquent, intended to mean \\"not a follower\\" in Latin. The company has grown substantially and entered into new business areas through acquisitions. The company saw a drop in revenue in 2001 in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble with revenue dropping in 2001 compared to 2000. To counter the drop off in business, Aquent purchased Renaissance Worldwide Inc., an IT consultancy and staffing firm, for $106 million. Aquent at that time had been known for offering staffing of print and web designers. The deal allowed Aquent to also offer back end support staffers, which was considered by the company to complement well as a package solution. The acquisition of Renaissance also included a municipal and state government IT consulting subsidiary, which as initially planned was sold months later in 2002 to EOne Global for $45 million. In 2003 the company made a hostile takeover offer for Computer Horizons Corporation, a computer network services company with a staffing business segment. Aquent through its investment banker Robert W. Baird & Co. had initially approached Computer Horizon's management on April 3, 2003 with an invitation to have dinner, which was rejected by Bill Murphy, the President and CEO of Computer Horizons. Aquent then proceeded to launch a cash tender offer on April 14, 2003 that valued Computer Horizons at $154 million. This proposal was opposed by management and in May the offer was rejected. Aquent acquired Corporate Project Resources Inc. (CPRi), a staffing agency for marketing jobs, in 2005 for $25 million and renamed it Aquent Marketing Staffing while keeping its operations in Chicago. In 2006, Aquent acquired Seattle-based Sakson & Taylor, a staffing agency focused on content development and design with a significant presence at Microsoft, along with offices in a handful of other cities. The Sakson & Taylor brand (with \\"an Aquent company\\" appended) was retained for some years, but is no longer used. The former Sakson & Taylor headquarters are now Aquent's Seattle offices. In 2011, Aquent launched a new division, Vitamin T, which focuses on placing \\"digital creatives\\" with marketing departments and advertising agencies for contract assignments. In 2018, Aquent acquired Dev6, a consulting company which provides training courses to application developers.  Aquent Studios  In 2003, Aquent Studios was launched a marketing division within Aquent that provides companies with an on/off site studio, which produces creative and marketing content. Aquent Studios also operates internationally.

Minimally invasive therapies Minimally invasive therapies can offer faster recovery compared with traditional prostate surgery.\\"Laser PVP surgery\\" mayocilic.org =Prostate laser surgery= Prostate laser surgery is used to relieve moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. The surgeon inserts a scope through the penis tip into the urethra. A laser passed through the scope delivers energy to shrink or remove excess tissue that is preventing urine flow.\\"Prostate laser surgery\\" mayoclinic.org Different types of prostate laser surgery include: * VLAP technique involving the Nd:YAG laser with contact on the prostatic tissue. * Photoselective Vaporisation of the Prostate (PVP). A laser is used to melt away (vaporize) excess prostate tissue and enlarge the urinary channel. A high-power 180-watt 532 nm wavelength laser with a 650-micrometre laser fiber is used. This fiber has an internal reflection with a 70-degree deflecting angle. It is used to vaporize the tissue to the prostatic capsule. GreenLight 532 nm lasers target haemoglobin as the chromophore and typically have a penetration depth of 0.8 mm (twice as deep as holmium). * Holmium Laser Ablation of the Prostate (HoLAP) is similar to PVP but uses a different type of laser. HoLAP uses a 550 um disposable side-firing fiber that directs the beam from a high-power 100-watt laser at a 70-degree angle from the fiber axis. The holmium wavelength is 2,140 nm, which falls within the infrared portion of the spectrum and is invisible to the naked eye. Whereas GreenLight relies on haemoglobin as a chromophore, water within the target tissue is the chromophore for Holmium lasers. The penetration depth of Holmium lasers is <0.4 mm, avoiding complications associated with tissue necrosis often found with the deeper penetration and lower peak powers of Nd:YAG lasers used in the 1990s. * * Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) is used to cut and remove the excess tissue that is blocking the urethra. Another instrument is then used to cut the prostate tissue into small pieces that are easily removed. HoLEP can be an option for men who have a severely enlarged prostate. HoLEP is largely similar to the HoLAP procedure; the main difference is that this procedure is typically performed on larger prostates. Instead of ablating the tissue, the laser cuts a portion of the prostate, which is then cut into smaller pieces and flushed with irrigation fluid. As with the HoLAP procedure, there is little bleeding during or after the procedure. Three 2015 reviews found that HoLEP is superior to TURP in some respects and for some patients. Comment in same issue of the journal. Both wavelengths, GreenLight and Holmium, ablate approximately one to two grams of tissue per minute. Post-surgical care often involves placement of a Foley catheter or a temporary prostatic stent to permit healing and allow urine to drain from the bladder. =Non-laser treatments= The two most common types of office-based therapies are transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) and transurethral needle ablation (TUNA). Both rely on delivering enough energy to create sufficient heat to cause cell death (necrosis) in the prostate. The goal is to cause enough necrosis so that, when the dead tissue is reabsorbed by the body, the prostate shrinks, relieving the obstruction of the urethra. These procedures are typically performed with local anesthesia, and the patient returns home the same day. Some urologists have studied and published long-term data on the outcomes of these procedures, with data out to five years. * Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) was originally approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996, with the first generation system by EDAP Technomed. Since 1996, other companies have received FDA approval for TUMT devices, including Urologix, Dornier, Thermatrix, Celsion, and Prostalund. Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT. The general principle underlying all the devices is that a microwave antenna that resides in a urethral catheter is placed in the intraprostatic area of the urethra. The catheter is connected to a control box outside of the patient's body and is energized to emit microwave radiation into the prostate to heat the tissue and cause necrosis. It is a one-time treatment that takes approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the system used. It takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks for the damaged tissue to be reabsorbed into the patient's body. Some of the devices incorporate circulating coolant through the treatment area with the intent of preserving the urethra while the microwave energy heats the prostatic tissue surrounding the urethra. * Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) operates with a different type of energy, radio frequency (RF) energy, but is designed along the same premise as TUMT devices, that the heat the device generates will cause necrosis of the prostatic tissue and shrink the prostate. The TUNA device is inserted into the urethra using a rigid scope much like a cystoscope. The energy is delivered into the prostate using two needles that emerge from the sides of the device, through the urethral wall and into the prostate. The needle-based ablation devices are very effective at heating a localized area to a high enough temperature to cause necrosis. The treatment is typically performed in one session, but may require multiple sticks of the needles depending on the size of the prostate. The most recent American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines for the Treatment of BPH from 2018 stated that \\"TUNA is not recommended for the treatment of LUTS/BPH\\". The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for the treatment of BPH from 2018 list minimally invasive therapies including TUMT - but not TUNA - as acceptable alternatives for certain patients with BPH. However, the European Association of Urology (EAU) has - as of 2019 - removed both TUMT and TUNA from its guidelines.EAU: Management of Non-neurogenic Male LUTS - Summary of Changes 2019. Invasive therapies The two invasive surgical procedures done for BPH: * Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): In general prior to emergence of laser technologies, TURP had been considered the gold standard of prostate interventions for people who require a procedure. This involves removing (part of) the prostate by inserting a resectoscope (cystoscope) through the urethra. However, after this endoscopic surgery the ejaculations are dry in about 65% of patients, unless a novel, ejaculation preserving, altered technique of TURP is applied. * Simple prostatectomy can also be offered to men who have large prostates (>50 grams). This can be done by open technique, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. Efforts to find newer surgical methods have resulted in newer approaches and different types of energies being used to treat the enlarged gland. However some of the newer methods for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, have not been around long enough to fully establish their safety or side-effects. These include various methods to destroy or remove part of the excess tissue while trying to avoid damaging what remains. Transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TVP), laser TURP, visual laser ablation (VLAP), ethanol injection, and others are studied as alternatives.  Complications of Prostate Surgery  The two most feared complications of prostate surgery are erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. The type of complications depend on the treatment modality used: * Urinary incontinence can happen after prostate surgery, especially stress urinary incontinence. The prostate is located right beneath the bladder, and surrounds the urethral sphincter. Any damage to the sphincter or surrounding muscles and nerves can lead to urinary incontinence. The problem is most severe in the first 6 to 12 months after treatment, but usually resolves on its own within this time. If the problem persists, conservative management is the first line treatment. This includes lifestyle modifications, kegel exercises, and bladder training. Artificial urinary sphincter implantation is considered the gold standard in moderate to severe cases if conservative management fails. * About 50% of patients who undergo prostatectomy will have some degree of erectile dysfunction. Treatment options include the use of oral drugs, vacuum devices, or a penile implant.  Other  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) of the UK in 2018 classified some novel methods as follows.National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): Current care pathway (for BPH), August 2018.

Not recommended: * High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): Current care pathway (for BPH), issue \\"Minimally invasive treatments\\", August 2018.  General prospects of surgery success  The success of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) ‚Äì as measured by a significant reduction of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) ‚Äì strongly depends on a reliable (unequivocal) pre-surgery diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). A pre-surgery diagnosis of other LUTS only, such as overactive bladder (OAB) with or without urinary incontinence predicts little or no success after surgery. If BOO is present or not can be determined by reliable non-invasive tests, such as the Penile cuff test (PCT). In this test, first published in 1997, a software-steered inflatable cuff (similar as in a blood pressure meter) is placed around the penis to measure the pressure of urinary flow. By applying this methode, a study of 2013 showed that 94% of the patients with the pre-surgery test result \\"Obstruction\\" had a successful surgery outcome. In contrast, 70% of the patients with the pre-surgery test result \\"No Obstruction\\" had a non-successful surgery outcome. If BPH with obstruction additionally presents with overactive bladder (OAB), which is the case in about 50% of patients, this latter symptom (OAB) persits even post- surgery in about 20% of patients. However, this rate only applies to a period of a few years. 10‚Äì15 years after surgery 48 of 55 patients (87%) with obstruction and OAB had kept their post-surgery reduction of obstruction, but their OAB symptoms had gone back to the pre-surgery status.

Biography There is scant biographical information about Ibn Nazif, and most information about him comes from his chronicle. He was likely born in Hama in the latter half of the 12th century to that city's prominent Banu Nazif clan, hence his name. He became a well-placed official in the court of the Ayyubid emir of Qal'at Ja'bar, al-Malik al-Hafiz ibn al-Adil (died 1240), who was subordinate to the Ayyubid emirs of Hama. Ibn Nazif was terminated from his post in 1230 as a result of a dispute with al-Hafiz over the fate of a slave. While drunk at a party, Ibn Nazif was arrested and had his properties confiscated on al- Hafiz's orders. He remained imprisoned for undetermined period, but was released by the Ayyubid emir of Jazira, al-Ashraf Musa, with whom Ibn Nazif maintained good relations. Ibn Nazif relocated to the Euphrates fortress town of al-Rahba where he received the patronage of its commander, al-Mansur Ibrahim. When the latter succeeded his father, al-Mujahid Shirkuh II, as emir of Homs, Ibn Nazif left with him. In Homs, Ibn Nazif was given a pension, which allowed him to pen his historical chronicle, Tarikh Mansuri, which he dedicated to al-Mansur. The date of his death is unknown, though he likely died in Homs. Few insights about his works revealed how he used curses in his records. This is demonstrated in his account of the fall of Jerusalem, which scholars noted was also strikingly concise: \\"The Franks - may God curse them - took Jerusalem.\\" Ibn Nazif also recorded events in the Ayyubid realm such as the rebuilding activities launched in the year 622/1225 at al-Raqqa.

His team, however, would crash out in the group stage following losses to each of their opponents; SK Gaming, Moscow Five, DTS Gaming as well as eSrael. The following months would see him slowly climbing the tiers of French teams in the game. In early 2012, he would join two known players atLaNtis and mshz in e2g, and later WCG legends HaRts and ioRek in Bizounours. The team attended GameGune 2012 in July, but kioShiMa and his team did not again manage to make an impact and fell out of the tournament in 9-12th place. The release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive followed soon after, and KioShiMa soon moved onto the new game, appearing in teams such as In Your Head and iGamerz. In May 2013, he was re-scouted by HaRts to reunite the core of the Bz team under the Clan-Mystik banner, also featuring the now notorious KQLY as a new member. The team would eventually go to win Electronic Sports World Cup 2013, marking the first big international achievement in kioShiMa's career. kioShiMa would leave the team, at that time known as Epsilon eSports, in September 2014 as the \\"French shuffle\\" began to take form. He formed a new team with former Titan members NBK, shox and SmithZz as well as Team LDLC.com captain Happy. The team was briefly known as Mercenary before being picked up by Happy former organization, who disbanded their former team due to showing disappointment at the former players' behavior in regards to their new contracts. kioShiMa and his new Team LDLC.com would then dominate the scene in France and even became a contender for the title of the best team in the world versus Fnatic.

As the in- game leader for Team Envy, and before that Team LDLC, Happy won two CS:GO Majors ‚Äì DreamHack Winter 2014 and DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca 2015 ‚Äì and finished second at another ‚Äì ESL One Cologne 2015, a performance record that led to him being ranked as one of the best players in the game's history. Happy is considered a star of the French CS:GO scene and along with Ex6TenZ, one of the country's best in-game leaders. Before CS:GO, he played Counter- Strike: Source under the name EMSTQD. Counter-Strike: Source Vincent Cervoni Schopenhauer began his Counter-Strike: Source (CSS) career in December 2007 under the name \\"EMSTQD\\" when he joined together with Ex6TenZ's team GlobalTeam. Based on their results, they signed with Epsilon eSports in February 2008. They became one of the best teams in France after adding RpK and shokkk to the roster, and in July, they won The eXperience LAN in Denmark. Happy left the team to captain his own team, Creativ' in 2009. In October 2009, Happy decided to re-join Ex6TenZ's team called redLine, who were later signed by VeryGames. Together, they managed to win EPS France VI, place 2nd in Dreamhack Winter and MaXlan later that year. In February 2010 Happy left VeryGames to focus on academics. Over the next couple of years he was in-game leader in several small teams, most notably for the 2011 3DMAX squad which also featured shox, ScreaM, and apEX, with whom he managed to finish third at the 2011 Copenhagen Games.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  = Early CS:GO career and Team LDLC = After Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released in August 2012, Vincent Cervoni Schopenhauer changed his nickname to \\"Happy\\" and formed a new team called PRIME in September 2012 with apEX and Maniac. The following month they were picked up by Team eXtensive! which became LDLC.com in January 2013. Due to poor results LDLC decided to disband their CS:GO team in August 2013. After this Happy formed another mixed team called WE GOT GAME with players such as fxy0 or GMX. They later added kennyS, Maniac, and Uzzziii to the team. This squad was signed by Recursive eSports before the first CS:GO Major sponsored by Valve, DreamHack Winter 2013. At DreamHack, they beat Universal Soldiers and iBUYPOWER on their way to a 2nd- place finish in the group behind Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP). In the quarter- finals they played Fnatic, who beat them 2-1 and went on to win the tournament. Due to lack of financial resources, Recursive eSports parted ways with their CS:GO division on 20 January 2014; despite this, players stayed together and created team Nameless. After rumours that Nameless and Clan- Mystik planned to merge their teams, Happy, together with Uzzziii, Maniac, along with KQLY and apEX from Clan-Mystik, joined LDLC in February 2014. Happy led this team to 1st place in DreamHack Valencia 2014 and a T5 placing in the second CS:GO major, EMS One Katowice, where they were defeated 0-2 by eventual Major champion Virtus.Pro. Happy led LDLC to a T3 placing at the next CS:GO Major, ESL One: Cologne 2014, where they beat Virtus.Pro in the quarterfinals before falling to eventual champion Ninjas in Pyjamas 1-2 after a 14-16 loss on the last map. At the beginning of September 2014, a few weeks after ESL One: Cologne 2014, three LDLC players, KQLY, apEX and Maniac, left the Happy- led LDLC squad and signed with another leading French CS:GO team, Titan eSports. In response, LDLC released their roster, and Happy formed a short- lived mix team called Mercenary, which contained Shox, NBK, SmithZz and kioShiMa, and was picked up by LDLC after two days. By late 2014, Happy was the best player on LDLC and one of the top players in the world. Happy became known for his play on the B site on the Counterterrorist side of the Inferno map. Before the next CS:GO major, LDLC was considered to be the second-best team in the world. At DreamHack Winter in November 2014, Happy led the LDLC squad to victory over Fnatic (who withdrew after using an illegal boost in their quarterfinal round against LDLC), Natus Vincere, and Ninjas in Pyjamas (NIP) in the grand finals. In the grand finals, Happy almost had double the kills of any other player in the first round, and his play carried LDLC from a 13-15 deficit into overtime on the third and final map. For his high level of play, Happy was named tournament MVP. This victory made Happy's LDLC squad the official CS:GO world champions and possibly the best team in the world, given their victory at the major and string of second-place finishes in less important tournaments beforehand. In January 2015, Happy led LDLC to victory at the MLG Aspen Invitational, the first CS:GO tournament organized by Major League Gaming. Happy had two crucial three-kill rounds against NIP in the first map of the grand finals, a rematch of the previous CS:GO major. Happy was the standout player of the tournament finals and was voted match MVP. = Team EnVyUs = Shortly afterwards, the players signed more lucrative contracts with Team EnVyUs. Happy's squad continued to have good results, winning 5 more 1st place titles before swapping Shox and SmithZz with Titan's KennyS and apEX. Originally it was thought that this new lineup would be less impressive than the first, but Happy lead the new lineup to another Major final at ESL One: Cologne 2015 and several other international titles in 2015. EnVyUs won DreamHack Open London 2015 and Happy achieved an all-kill of the Team SoloMid team using a Desert Eagle that was described by Kotaku Australia as \\"one of the most impressive Counter-Strike plays in recent memory\\" and as one of the best aces in CS:GO history by Expressen. In November 2015, EnVyUs won a second CS:GO major at DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca, where they defeated Natus Vincere 2-0 in the grand finals. In the first match of the grand finals, played on the Train map, Happy successfully played mind games with Natus Vincere, and made a key play in the 28th round by holding the B bomb site against enemy defuse attempts using an AK-47. In December 2015, Happy led EnVyUs to a 2‚Äì0 victory over Fnatic in the group stage of the ESL ESEA Pro League Season II finals that took them into the playoffs at their top of their group and as favourites to win the event. In March 2016, Happy's EnVyUs team was ranked 10th in ESPN.com's CS:GO powerrankings amidst speculation that roster changes were incoming. By mid-March, Happy was replaced as EnVyUs's in- game leader by teammate NBK, with whom he had sometimes shared in-game leader duties. Later that month at the MLG Major Championship: Columbus, Happy's streak of making the playoff bracket at every CS:GO Major was broken after EnVyUs was upset by Gambit Gaming, and became the first Legend (i.e. a top four finisher at the previous Major) to be eliminated in the group stage. At DreamHack Masters Malm√∂ in April 2016, Happy led EnVyUs to a comeback victory against Team Dignitas in the first game of the quarterfinals, which EnVyUs ended up winning 2-0. Happy's team was then defeated 2‚Äì0 in the semifinals by Na'vi. = Team Vitality = After a four-month break from professional Counter-Strike, happy moved to a newly founded team \\"Team Vitality\\", along with fellow French players NBK-, apEX and RpK. He would be \\"benched\\" on 28 December 2018.https://www.hltv.org/news/25717/vitality-bench-happy = Playstyle and leadership = Happy's in-game leadership style is considered controversial for its aggressive style and frequent assumption of risks such as higher than average use of force buys, executing plans with a focus on speed, and the use of baiting. Tomi Kovanen, writing for PC Gamer, argued that Happy's leadership was overshadowed by the pure skill of the team he leads, and that Happy was better as a fragger than as an in-game leader. In September 2015, PC Gamer named Happy the 4th best CS:GO player and the best player who played in a lurker role at the time, noting that his ability to use the AWP, lead his team, and play with all the weapons in the game made him \\"almost a complete player\\". It also named Happy as possibly the most individually successful in-game leader in CS:GO history because of his status as the best player on EnVyUS, which was a top three team for 2015. In an January 2016 interview with Splyce, Happy said that he had \\"kind of destroyed the strats heavy meta\\" because of his preference for flexible, unorthodox strategies. Happy is known for his play on the B site on the Counterterrorist side of the Inferno map.

It is located on State Road 64. Popash was founded in the 1850s, and was well-established by the late 1870s. It was possibly named after the pop ash tree. Railroad construction created a possibility of town growth, but the railroad ended up not being routed through the town. Popash has no official written history, it also has no historical placemarkers. In contemporary times, residents work as farmers, ranch workers and at orange groves around the town.  History  Popash was a town and agricultural community that was founded in the 1850s, and was a well-established community by \\"the late 1870s\\". In 1879 a post office and The New Hope Baptist Church were organized and established in the community. The post office existed from 1879 to 1887, at which time it was relocated to Zolfo Springs. The church is one of the oldest ones in Hardee County. The town's cemetery, named The New Hope Cemetery, was founded in the late 1870s and is located across from the church. The town's name is possibly named after the pop ash tree. The building of the railroad in 1886 raised the possibility that it might come to the town, but instead it was routed through Zolfo Springs. This dashed hopes of the town experiencing growth, and the town remained relatively small and \\"sleepy\\". The town's first school was established circa 1898, at which time Popash was located in DeSoto County. Many of the town's activities and events were based at the school and the church. The school closed in 1948, and after several changes of ownership, was demolished in 2009. In 1951, the school was sold to the Board of County Commissioners for $100.00, after which time it was sold to various people throughout the 1950s. When they sold it, just two weeks after its purchase, the Board of County Commissioners retained a small section of 100 square feet to be used as a voting precinct for the general area \\"for years\\". Attempts were made to have the school listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, but the building was deemed as lacking in historical significance by Florida state officials. A general store was constructed in 1943, and was still in place as of 1987. Popash has no official written history, and the town lacks historical placemarkers. In contemporary times In contemporary times, Popash residents have worked as farmers, ranch workers and at the orange orchards around the town. Up to 1987, many of the residents of Popash were natives of the settlement. References External links * * Images of Popash. Flickrhivemind.net.

He worked for the United States Bureau of Printing and Engraving, private bank note printers, and in China, assisting the government with establishing a government bureau of printing and engraving. His portrait of Ulysses S. Grant circulated from 1886-1891 on the $5.00 silver certificate, and his engraving of Abraham Lincoln continues to appear on today's $5 bill. Hatch was born in Hartford, New York and raised in Dorset, Vermont. He studied at the Washington Art Students' Club and with Robert Henri. Early in his career, he found his talent for engraving intricate portraits in metals. In 1874, the head of the United States Bureau of Printing and Engraving admired Hatch's portrait of George Washington on copper and hired him. During his time in Washington, D.C., Hatch spent his nights studying drawing and watercolor painting. However, his talent to engrave vignettes of presidents and other famous figures proved more impressive. In 1888, Hatch moved to Chicago to work for a private bank note company. There, he met Grace Harrison of California. They were married and had one son, Harrison in 1902. After taking a job in New York City with another bank note company, Hatch solidified his reputation in the field. Around 1908, the Chinese government invited Hatch to establish a Bureau of Printing and Engraving modeled after that of the United States. He accepted a six-year contract to oversee the building of the bureau and train the Chinese to run the office. With his wife, their son, and sister-in-law Effie Harrision, Lorenzo moved to Peking. During his time in China, Lorenzo Hatch succeeded in building the foundations for a modern printing bureau. However, the Xinhai Revolution in China between 1911-1912 hindered completion. He described his experiences, perceptions, and insecurities of being in China to his family and friends through letters. Before his contract ended, Hatch died on February 3, 1914. His body was returned to Dorset, Vermont and is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery across from his boyhood home.

She was one of the premier women's rights activists in Munich at the turn of the century and a business partner and companion of Anita Augspurg. When their partnership dissolved, Goudstikker became a more moderate feminist and partnered with Ika Freudenberg. Goudstikker was the inspiration for three different writers' depictions of a more masculine woman, who defied typical feminine characterizations. She was the first unmarried German woman to obtain a royal license for photography and the first German woman allowed to argue cases before the youth court. Early life Sophia Goudstikker was born on 15 January 1865 in Rotterdam, Netherlands to Grietje (n√©e Klisser) and Salomon Elias Goudstikker. In 1867, the family left Rotterdam and settled in Hamburg, Germany. They left thereafter with the youngest children and moved to Dresden, where Salomon died in 1892. Goudstikker attended an art school in Dresden, which was directed by Anita Augspurg‚Ä≤s sister and the two young women met, when Anita came to Dresden for a visit. Augspurg and Goudstikker determined that Munich would be open to a business enterprise run by women and relocated after Augspurg inherited her grandmother's estate. Career and feminism Goudstikker and Augspurg arrived in Munich and founded the Hofatelier Elvira in 1887. Goudstikker was the first German woman, who was not married, to obtain a royal license for photography. The studio became a meeting place for the avant-garde and was frequented by many noted figures. Isadora Duncan, Marie-Ad√©la√Øde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Rainer Maria Rilke, and other artists, intellectuals and royalty had their photographs taken there. In 1898 the partnership dissolved and Goudstikker ran the studio alone until 1908. She hired the architect, August Endell to design the studio, at #15 Von-der-Tann- Stra√üe, which became quite noted. The turquoise and violet Art Nouveau fa√ßade with a stylized dragon in bas-relief was a recognizable landmark. Goudstikker's younger sister Mathilde Nora, often called Nora, joined her to work as a photographer. Near the end of her life, Goudstikker leased the business to the photographer Emma Uibleisen, but World War I and its aftermath had dispersed the traditional clientele. Atelier (Hofatelier) Elvira As their photography business grew, the two women became staunch feminists. Goudstikker and Augspurg were interested in redefining women's spaces. Goudstikker wore short hair and simple, relaxed clothing and projected what seemed to contemporaries to be a female masculinity. She was the inspiration of characters such as \\"Hans\\" in Lou Andreas-Salom√©‚Ä≤s M√§dchenreign, \\"she\\" in ‚Ä≤s She and He and \\"Box\\" in Ernst von Wolzogen‚Ä≤s novel The Third Sex. Diary entries of Salom√© and B√ºlow confirm that Goudstikker was the muse for all three characters and they gave Goudstikker the nickname \\"Puck\\". In 1889, Goudstikker and Augspurg joined the movement to open university study to women, German Women for Reform, and then the following year, joined the Modern Life Society to advance modernity into social and artistic realms for women. The meetings of both organizations were kept under surveillance by police, who believed that they fostered immorality and breached the ban on women's political involvement. Augspurg was often the speaker, while Goudstikker's job was to convince the authorities that the meetings were not for the purpose of political agitation. In May, 1894, Goudstikker and Augspurg founded the Society for Women's Interests (), to broaden the reach of women's organizations to include the socio-economic sphere. Ika Freudenberg was one of the founders of this organization, and though a more moderate feminist, served as its manager from 1896 until her death. When Augspurg and Goudstikker‚Ä≤s partnership dissolved, Goudstikker moved toward practical issues of feminism focusing on economic and legal parity. She led the legal protection office of the VFF from its founding in 1898 until her death and was the first German woman permitted to represent youth court cases. In the youth courts, a legal degree or license was not required and while self-taught, Goudstikker's prowess at legal defense earned respect in Munich. When the new studio building was completed, Goudstikker and Freudenberg lived together in the building behind the studio at #3a K√∂niginstra√üe. In 1898 Goudstikker converted from Judaism to Protestantism. Goudstikker died in Munich on 20 March 1924. Legacy Goudstikker has become a focus of American gender scholars of lesbianism, though has largely been ignored by German scholars. The era was one in which Victorian ideals of womanhood still demanded that a woman's place was within a heterosexual union and in charge of bringing up children and managing the household affairs. Demands for sexual freedom and women's desire was a relatively new concept at the time and not accepted by the majority of women's activists or the public in general. The women in her circle strove to redefine what women's community was. Hofatelier Elvira was widely reported to be an enclave for homosexuality and the growing visibility of same-sex partnerships. From a gender perspective, Goudstikker avoids a strict binary interpretation as her business and intimate relationships were varied. With Augspurg, both strove to embody masculine traits, with Freudenberg the relationship was one in which Freudenberg has been described as a feminine and Goudstikker as a masculine partner, and in her relationships with B√ºlow and Salom√©, there is a shared feminine aspect. In part, the era imbued masculine identity with independence, and Goudstikker's androgyny forced writers to try to restore her femininity or destroy it entirely and masculinize her. A park in Munich Ramersdorf is named after her.https://www.google.com/maps/place/S.+Goudstikker+Park/@48.1136213,11.601257,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfe4cb671c1623735?sa=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiQ7tT527bpAhWiVBUIHc80A0EQ_BIwCnoECAwQBg  References  =Citations= =Bibliography=       * * Category:1865 births Category:1924 deaths Category:19th-century Dutch photographers Category:19th-century German photographers Category:20th- century Dutch photographers Category:20th-century German photographers Category:Dutch women photographers Category:German suffragists Category:German women photographers Category:People from Rotterdam Category:Portrait photographers Category:Dutch women's rights activists Category:Photographers from Munich Category:Converts to Protestantism from Judaism Category:19th- century women photographers Category:20th-century women photographers ","title":"Sophia Goudstikker"},{"id":"50551927","text":"Mauricio Magdaleno Cardona (13 May 1906 ‚Äì 30 June 1986), better known as Mauricio Magdaleno, was a Mexican screenwriter and occasional director of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.

Its owner was the Green Grand & Colorado River Navigation Company headed by B. S. Ross. The company was formed to run a line of excursion steamers down the Green River to its conjunction with the Colorado River and four miles down the Colorado as far as the first cataract at the head of Cataract Canyon, to a hotel to be built for tourists. The Major Powell was 35 feet long and 8 feet abeam, with a 26 inch draft. It had an open deck covered by a canvas canopy. Its two 6 horsepower steam engines were coal-fired, each driving one of the twin screws. At first a failure on its first trial run after its launch due to the screws being struck by rocks in the fast moving and shallow water, the screws were afterward protected by iron guards, which enabled its success in its first voyage under the command of a local rancher Arthur Wheeler. Leaving April 15, 1882 the Major Powell descended to the Colorado River on the Green River, through Labyrinth Canyon and Stillwater Canyon and then down to the first cataract below the confluence with the Green River. Under-powered it barely made headway against the current of the Green River on its return journey on this first voyage and ran low on coal, forcing the crew to tie it up at Wheeler's ranch, 22 miles below Green River on the river and travel over land to announce their success at that town on July 3, 1892.Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 A second voyage down river was made, after the Major Powell was converted to using wood for fuel. This voyage took a month to complete, however it took only 4 days of that time to make the round trip on the river between Wheeler's ranch and the first cataract of the Colorado. Much of the rest of the time was spent obtaining the cottonwood logs to fire the engine. However despite these two successes, the Major Powell was dismantled in 1894 for its machinery, its hull left, to be washed away in the next flood.

The idea is to harvest the abundant nitrogen ice on the surface of Triton and use it as propellant for multiple short flights and explore a variety of locations. The concept transitioned in March 2018 to Phase II to refine their designs and explore aspects of implementing the new technology. History Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. In 1989, Voyager 2 flew past the moon at a distance of 40,000 km, and discovered several cryovolcanoes on its surface. Triton is geologically active; its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters. It has a very thin atmosphere. The Triton Hopper concept started Phase I in 2015, and it transitioned in March 2018 to Phase II, where the new technologies are being matured by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC).Triton Hopper: Exploring Neptune's Captured Kuiper Belt Object. Steven Oleson, NASA Glenn Research Center. 30 March 2018. Overview The Triton Hopper concept proposes the use of a radioisotope rocket engine that would collect nitrogen ice on or below the surface, heat it under pressure and use it as propellant to explore Neptune's moon Triton. The largest technological challenge is to learn how to mine local surface nitrogen ice, and how to heat it for use as propellant. The rocket-powered hops are estimated to be up to 1 km high and 5 km long. A rocket-powered vehicle, or \\"hopper\\", has several advantages due to the variety of terrain and a gravity of only 8% of that of Earth. Hemispheric traverses and atmospheric sampling are possible during hops. While airborne, the craft could acquire images and videos during flight. While on the ground, it could photograph and analyze the chemistry and geology of the surface. It could potentially fly through geysers on Triton's surface to analyze the material ejected from them.

Nezu was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in the National Diet in 1904 and won three subsequent reelections. He was elevated to the House of Peers in 1926. In 1905 Nezu became President of Tobu Railway and successfully helped to grow the company to one of the largest private rail operators in the Kanto region. Other business interests included managerial and shareholding roles in Tokyo Basha Tetsudo (Tokyo Horse-Drawn Carriage Railways), Tokyo Dento (Tokyo electric Light Company) and in Tokyo Gas. Philanthropy Accompanying Shibusawa Eiichi on a trade mission to the United States in 1909, Nezu was inspired by American industrialists' enthusiasm for civic and philanthropic activities. On his return to Japan Nezu founded and donated to a number of new educational and cultural initiatives including Musashi Junior and Senior High School. Nezu Memorial Museum, YamanashiNezu was a keen practitioner of the Japanese tea ceremony and his extensive private collection of pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art, served as the basis for the Nezu Museum in Minato, Tokyo.

Released in 1954, he worked as a bricklayer. Dissident activities and forced psychiatric treatment In the 1960s, he joined the human rights movement in the Soviet Union, signed a number of collective letters, and participated in collecting materials for Alexander Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, being himself one of the 255 witnesses consulted by the author.

Vladimir Gershuni's grave In 1978, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Dr. Gerard Low-Beer visited Moscow and examined nine Soviet political dissidents, including Gershuni, and came to the conclusion that they have no signs of mental illness, which would require mandatory treatment currently or in the past. Third arrest In the 1970s, Gershuni resumed his dissident activities as co-editor of the samizdat magazine Poiski (Quest or Investigations, 1976‚Äì1978), and was one of the founders in 1979 of \\"SMOT\\", the Free Interprofessional Association of Workers.

The 13-14th-century church was erected by the Franciscan order and dedicated to St Francis, who visited the town at least twice in his lifetime. History According to Tommaso da Celano‚Äôs Life of Saint Francis, (Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone), whose nickname was Francesco (b.1181 ‚Äì d.1226) visited San Gemini two times. The first time in 1213, when he was the guest of Count Pietro Capitoni whose wife was possessed by a demon. The saint performed a miracle by ordering the demon to leave the woman. Sometime after the death of San Francis, in 1226 the Capitoni family donated the land for Church and Franciscan monasteries. Francis of Assisi in his lifetime became an extremely popular preacher, particularly in Umbria, and in practically every town there were groups of his followers. Soon after his death and canonization in 1228, Franciscan churches and monasteries were being built. This church was originally located outside the city walls, facing the main city gate (porta Burgi) and an area that was used as the main market ground. It was common at the time for monastic complexes to be located outside of the city boundaries, in order to maintain greater independence from the local bishops. The Capitoni family was the main patron during construction of the church, their coat of arms is shown prominently in the capitals of the entrance door jambs. Construction of the church probably starts in the second half of the 13th century, in a Romanesque style, and is not completed until the beginning of the 14th century, when it takes the form of a simple Franciscan-Gothic style church. The apse and the front portal, which are done in a more elaborate gothic style, are probably the last components to be built. At this time the church had three gothic style side chapels along the left side wall. Door jamb with Capitoni coat of arms The church seems to have gone through three major renovations: one in the 15th century, in the 18th century and in 1953-55. 15th century Renovation In the 15th century the three side chapels are closed and are replaced by a single large side chapel that corresponds to the large semicircular arch in the center of the left side. On the opposite wall a series of altars are built, they probably are similar to the existing one with the statue of the Madonna and child. In this period probably all the 14th century fresco decorations are painted over and the church takes a more sober Renaissance interior d√©cor. The 18th century Renovation Sometime after the 1703 earthquake, the church is renovated under the sponsorship of the Santa Croce, the feudal lords of San Gemini. At the same time the adjacent Franciscan Monastery is rebuilt and takes its present aspect. Some new elements are introduced in the church, at least three new side altars built in masonry and stucco in a baroque style. At some later point, perhaps the mid-19th century, two wooden 17th century altars are introduced. They appear not to be made for this church but moved from another location (perhaps the church of Santo Gemine, whose interiors are completely redone in mid-19th century). At this time, it seems that the apse‚Äôs decorations are redone with new wall and vault paintings, in the front of the church over the entrance a wood choir is built, and the rose window is replaced with a rectangular one. The altar is redone, and a low wall separates the presbytery from the apse, and the bell tower is repaired or rebuilt. The interior walls of the church were probably decorated with painted to imitate stonework and architectural elements. After the unification of Italy, the church and the monastery were seized by the new Italian state as part of the 1866 law confiscating church properties. The monastery became a public school and still is the Middle school of San Gemini. The church became a warehouse and was bought back by the parish and reopened as a church in 1898. At this time much of the interior was whitewashed. Renovations after the 1950s The approach taken at the time was to bring back the church to its original medieval state mostly by the removal of the additions and decorations introduced in the 18th century. Three masonry and stucco altars. Since little remained of the medieval decoration, the result of this approach is that the interior walls are blank with a few fragments of mural paintings. The 18th century altar and separation walls were removed, all 18th century wall and ceiling paintings were stripped from the walls, a new gothic style window was added in the apse, and the rose window was reconstructed from some remaining fragments. The floor of the church is all new except for the crypt hatches. New heating and electrical systems where introduced into the building. In the 1960s, a free-standing altar is added. From 1994, to 2020, the Associazione Valorizzazione del Patrimonio Storico Onlus and Massimo Violati sponsor the restoration of the entrance door jambs, the restoration by Bruno Bruni of the Ceramic bust of San Bernardino, and the restoration of the 14th century wood entrance doors. Front facade In 2020, the San Gemini Preservation Studies Program and the Associazione Valorizzazione del Patrimonio Storico Onlus will start a campaign to restore the front fa√ßade of the church, involving the cleaning and pointing of the stone masonry. Architecture and Interior Decoration This simple white limestone fa√ßade is a good example of plain the Franciscan-Gothic architecture, it expresses their religious ideology of poverty and simplicity. The fa√ßade has very limited decorative elements mostly around the portal. Originally the rose windows probably had an elaborate tracery pattern that is now lost. The decorated door jambs, like the apse, show a richer quality of gothic details that probably came at the end of the construction. On the capitals of the engaged columns one finds the coat of arms of the Capitoni family, indicating their patronage of the church. The wooden exterior doors are original from the 14th century. Above the portal there is an arched niche with a mural depicting Saint Francis painted in the 1950s by the local painter Tullio Bertozzi. Above the niche there is the reconstructed rose window, the rim of which is in part original, the rest was rebuilt in 1953. Above the window is the coat of arms of the Franciscan order, a cross with the two hands of Sant Francis with the stigmata. The interior of the church is a simple uninterrupted rectangular space. Opposite to the entrance is the octagonal apse and the presbytery. There are no side isles, though originally there were three chapels along the right-side wall, which are now walled in. The church is all on one level, the presbytery is slightly raised to improve visibility. This organization of the church, introduced by Franciscans, is a break with the medieval tradition of the 3-level church (entrance level church, cryptal chapel and raised presbytery). The roof is supported by a series of transversal pointed arches in brick construction that rest on stone brackets on the side walls. They support the roof directly without an attic level. This type of structure allowed the builders to have a wide span to cover a large open space. This new organization of the church, which allowed the congregation to gather all in a single uninterrupted space, in part reflects a more egalitarian philosophy of the Franciscan Order but also the increasing importance of preaching and sermon-giving with the Franciscan religious movement. Interior Presently the interior walls are mostly in undecorated plaster with fragments of fresco paintings from different periods. Originally the 14th century walls would typically be covered with fresco paintings. It seems that the base of the walls had images of saints framed by red, white and black stripe borders. The upper part of the walls would typically have painting cycles depicting, on the left side, stories from the old and new testament and, on the right wall, stories from the life of Saint Francis. The wooden entrance vestibule in the counterfacade was probably made in the 18th century. There was a wooden choir platform over the entrance up to the 1953 when it was removed. On the inside of the fa√ßade wall we have multiple fresco fragments overlaying each other. On the right side one can see a fragment of a 15th century adoration of the magi that is very deteriorated, also a 15th century Madonna and child and other fragmented images of saints. Left side (when looking at altar) Four stone arches reveal the previous existence of side chapels that are presently closed off with masonry walls; the first three are in gothic style from the XIII-XIV centuries, the central round arch is in a 15th century Renaissance style. The windows on the upper wall vary in style and reveal that the church was first started in a Romanesque style in the 13th century with round arches and were later adapted to include a trilobed gothic motif in the 14th century when the Gothic style had taken root. Churches in this period were built slowly over many decades and often show variations in the architectural styles that take place during their construction. On the left side there is a 17th century wood pulpit with caryatids installed on top a more recent confessional; it is accessed from the sacristy. Beyond the pulpit there is a painted crucifixion 14th century style framed by a painted Gothic arch under the cross, there in a reliquary coffin built into the wall behind an iron grate. In the coffin there is a wooden sculpture of the dead Christ. Above, In the upper wall there are two frescos from the early 15th century: the upper one depicting the Madonna in Throne and the lower one depicting the saints Cosma and Damian with the rest of the image missing. The right wall (when facing the altar) Four niches with fragmental mural decorations remain from old altars or shrines that have since been removed. From the front to back St. Luci between Saint John Baptist and Saint Rocco made in 15th century, a crucifixion between Saint Gerome and Saint Leonard dated 1599, The incredulity of St Thomas 16th century, beyond there is a side altar originally from the 15th century with a modern statue of the Virgin Mary and Child, beyond in a round niche is a newly restored 15th century ceramic bust of San Bernardino that was originally located at the Oratory of San Bernardino (now Bar Paretti on via Roma). The front wall On the wall around the apse opening we find a series of 17th century frescos depicting Franciscan Saints among which Saint Anthony of Padua. The Apse and Altar 14th Century fresco on apse wall The apse of the church is five sides and is covered by radiating Gothic vaults which spring from the top of engaged columns resting on stone brackets located about a third of the way up the side of the walls. The columns, capitals and ribs of the apse are in a more elaborate style stonework similar to what is found on the front portal of the church. It was probably done at the same time and by the same masonry crews of the portal. The rear Gothic style window with stained glass depicting St. Francis St. Gemine, St. Rocco and St. Matilda is new and was all done in the 1950s. The masonry vaults and upper walls are now bare. The mural paintings, probably 18th century, were removed in 1953. In the lower part of the apse wall some interesting fragments of the 14th century fresco decorations are still visible, one can see on the right-side Saint Francis depicted, also Saint Cristofer and the Saints Cosmas and Damian. On the opposite side there is a fresco of the crucifixion. The present altars are new: the rear larger one was built during the 1953 renovation. The smaller free standing one was added in the 1960s after Vatican II council a new freestanding altar is added to church. Bell tower The bell tower is attached to the rear of the church on the right side. It was built after the original structure and the base is rectangular. Originally the top probably had a roof with arched openings around the bells. The present sail-type top was built in the 18th century, probably after being damaged during the 1703 earthquake.

Starring Sukarsih and , it follows a woman who descends into prostitution after her husband marries another woman. It was both Persari's first production and the first film directed by a woman in Indonesian history. Plot Over a period of several years, Patmah has worked to help her husband Tamin build his book- selling business into a large printing house. However, in the early 1940s, after the business begins to succeed Tamin takes on a younger wife. Outraged at her husband's polygyny, Patmah abandons him and goes to work as a nurse, leaving their four-year-old daughter Nuraini with her friend, Tinah. During the Japanese occupation, Patmah is promised that she can receive further training as a nurse in Tokyo. Upon arrival, however, she discovers that the young nurses are actually intended as comfort women. Patmah thus spends the remainder of World War II satisfying the sexual desires of Japanese soldiers. After the war, when she returns to Indonesia, Patmah is unable to reintegrate into society and continues work as a prostitute. One day, Patmah hears that the now-adult Nuraini is to be wed to Tamin, now a widower; both are unaware of their blood relations. She succeeds in breaking up the planned marriage and in arranging for Nuraini to wed Burhan, a young author whom Nuraini loves. Patmah is tried for prostitution shortly afterwards and eventually dies of a sexually transmitted disease. Production Sedap Malam was directed by Ratna Asmara, a former stage and film actress who had starred in such films as Kartinah (1940) and Djaoeh di Mata (1949), in her directorial debut. The film thus became the first in Indonesian history to be directed by a woman; previously, women had been limited to acting roles. The film was also the first production by Persari (Perseroan Artis Indonesia, or Indonesian Artists Corporation), a production house headed by Djamaluddin Malik. This was his first foray into film, though he had backed the travelling theatre troupe Bintang Timur during the Indonesian National Revolution. Andjar Asmara, Ratna's husband and a former film director and dramatist, penned the story for Sedap Malam. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran classifies the film's plot as characteristic of the theatre and of domestic films produced between 1937 and 1941: \\"melodramatic stories, dramatisations fabricated with tired themes\\" such as materialistic women, loan sharks, arranged marriages, and polygamy. Production for Sedap Malam began in September 1950, and by December of that year Persari was advertising its black-and-white film as being immediately ready for distribution. Sukarsih and were cast in the film's starring roles, as Patmah and Tamin respectively. portrayed the adult Nuraini, whereas Rd Mochtar took the role of Burhan. Aminah was cast in a supporting role. Sound editing for the film was handled by Boen Kim Nam, whereas cinematography was done by Tjit Ka Sie. Release and legacy Sedap Malam premiered in Jakarta at the Rex, Roxy, Orion, and Shanghai theatres on 14 February 1951. Rated for audiences aged 17 and older, it was advertised as the first Indonesian film to deal with the issue of prostitution. By May 1951 Sedap Malam had been released in Malang, East Java, where it was described as a \\"super production by Persari which will shake and demand the attention of society\\". Ratna Asmara followed Sedap Malam with another four productions, two of which she produced through her Asmara Studios. During her directorial career Ratna received little support from male directors. Women directors remained uncommon in Indonesia until the 2000s. Only three women directors other than Ratna Asmara are recorded between 1950 and 1998: Citra Dewi, Sofia W.D., and Ida Farida. These directors rarely, if ever, received the same recognition as their male counterparts; acting remained the only way for a woman in the industry to gain recognition.

Construction extended past the gothic period, and thus the church is an eclectic accumulation of styles. The facade has a romanesque simplicity and cornice, with a gothic window in place of the oculus, and a renaissance-style cornice; all this standing beside a baroque bell-tower.

The character is a shrewd but inelegant blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his shambling manner, rumpled beige raincoat and off-putting, relentless investigative approach. Columbo is portrayed primarily by Peter Falk, who appeared in the role from 1968 through 2003. Columbo's first name has never officially been identified, although the name \\"Frank Columbo\\" has been visible on pieces of identification throughout the show's history. The character of Columbo was created by Richard Levinson and William Link, who said that Columbo was partially inspired by the Crime and Punishment character Porfiry Petrovich as well as G. K. Chesterton's humble cleric-detective Father Brown. Other sources claim Columbo's character is also influenced by Inspector Fichet from the French suspense-thriller film Les Diaboliques (1955). In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 in the UK Columbo was ranked 18th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. Biography Over the years, the chatty Columbo would let slip many details about his personal life in conversations with suspects. However, in the episode \\"Dead Weight\\", Columbo more-or-less admits that he will sometimes make up certain details about his life, even fabricating fictional relatives, in order to establish a better rapport with a suspect. As a result, some of the following biographical details may be exaggerated or otherwise inaccurate, particularly those concerning his family life. Columbo's boyhood hero was Joe DiMaggio, and he liked gangster pictures. Columbo broke street lamps and played too much pinball (he expressed a wish to have a pinball machine at home). The trick of putting a potato in a car exhaust‚Äîwhich purportedly prevents the car from starting without causing permanent damage‚Äîserved well on one of his cases. He jokes that he became a cop in part to make up for these juvenile pranks. In \\"The Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case\\", in a conversation with the suspect, Columbo revealed: \\"All my life I kept running into smart people. I don't just mean smart like you and the people in this house. You know what I mean ...\\" He added, \\"I could tell right away that it wasn't gonna be easy making detective as long as they were around\\", but he determined that he could even the odds \\"by working harder than any of them, reading all of the required books and paying attention to every detail.\\" His trademark outfit of a rumpled raincoat over a suit-and-tie never varies from case to case or year to year‚Äîwith one exception; when he gets a new raincoat as a birthday gift from his wife in the episode \\"Now You See Him\\". Columbo says that he \\"can't think\\" in this coat, and desperately tries to lose it. Finally he is able to retrieve his beloved original raincoat. He sometimes wears his trademark outfit while on vacation. In the episode \\"Troubled Waters\\", Columbo takes a Mexican cruise with his wife, and boards the cruise ship in his usual attire. Upon meeting Columbo dressed in the raincoat, the Captain of the ship quips \\"Oh, tell me Lieutenant, do you expect inclement weather in the Mexican waters?\\" Later in the film he wears a Hawaiian shirt, during a party. Although not socially polished, Columbo is polite, addressing everyone to do with the case as \\"sir\\", \\"ma'am\\" or \\"miss\\". He rarely displays anger toward his prime suspect, though he sometimes becomes frustrated with other characters. In an impromptu speech to a ladies' club meeting hosted by Ruth Gordon's character, at which he shows up uninvited, he admits that over the course of many of his investigations he grew to like and respect the suspects. Columbo rarely carries a gun, and is never shown to exercise much physical force; in some episodes he allows himself to be placed in a predicament in which the killer believes he or she will be able to kill Columbo and escape. In the 1971 episode \\"Death Lends a Hand,\\" it is revealed that he does not carry a gun when he walks through a metal detector and doesn't set it off. In the 1975 episode \\"Forgotten Lady\\" he explains that he keeps it \\"downtown\\", and in other episodes he expresses a strong dislike of guns and their use, as well as an intolerance to the noise produced when firing them. Additionally, in \\"Troubled Waters\\", Columbo claims to be \\"a bad shot\\". In \\"Forgotten Lady\\", it is also revealed that Columbo has failed to attend his required semi-annual evaluation at the department's firing range in the last ten years, leading him to ask a colleague to take the test for him to avoid being suspended. He does carry a gun for his work in 1992's \\"No Time to Die\\" and 1994's \\"Undercover\\" (even threatening someone with it in the latter), both of which are based on Ed McBain novels. \\"Murder Under Glass\\" reveals Columbo to be an accomplished cook, having learned a recipe for veal scaloppine from his Italian father, which he makes for the killer, a famed food critic, who seems impressed by it. However, in \\"Murder by the Book\\" he claims he can cook only a certain type of omelette, which he cooks for the victim's wife. In early episodes, he appears to be particularly fond of eating chili con carne. In \\"Identity Crisis,\\" Columbo clearly speaks fluent Italian, which he demonstrates again later on in \\"Murder Under Glass\\" and yet again in \\"Death Hits The Jackpot\\" in 1991. But by the time mob boss Vincenzo Fortelli (Rod Steiger) addresses Columbo in Italian in \\"Strange Bedfellows\\" (Season 10, 1995) he no longer speaks or understands the language. When inspecting a chemical formula in \\"Lovely but Lethal\\", he claims not to have recognized the writing as Latin, stating that he had \\"only taken Spanish\\", some of which he speaks in \\"A Matter of Honor.\\" Columbo presents himself as a simple man, easily impressed by the West Coast movers, shakers and celebrities whom the writers love to cast as their villains. He often finds occasion during cases to take advantage of the suspect's social circle (e.g. the cuisine on tap in \\"Murder Under Glass\\"). As a distraction tactic, Columbo regularly asks to sit behind the wheel of a suspect's luxury car. He asks suspects who are authors to sign copies of their books, suspects who are actors for their autograph to take home to Mrs. Columbo, his wife, and so on. He has good enough taste to fully appreciate all the fine perks he obtains from his suspects, but he often seems to be (or pretends to be) in awe of their wealthy lifestyles. He sometimes comments on the absurdity of spending thousands of dollars on a bottle of wine or a couch, when he himself lives on an income of $11,000 a year. He also possesses an encyclopedic knowledge, which he usually hides. He has explained to colleagues that his wife believes there is \\"something wrong\\" with him. His other trademark is the ever-present (but not always lit) cigar. More than once he attempts to quit smoking. Columbo has explained that he smokes cigars although his wife wishes he would smoke a pipe, which Columbo refuses to try \\"because there's too much stuff to carry around.\\" His shoe size is referred to as \\"10 1/2 or 11\\" in \\"By Dawn's Early Light\\". Columbo appears to be prone to airsicknessColumbo; \\"Ransom for a Dead Man\\"; 1971 and seasickness,Columbo; \\"Dead Weight\\"; 1971 and he cannot swim, though he has been known to row a boat.Columbo; \\"Last Salute to the Commodore\\"; 1976 In \\"Dead Weight\\", when General Hollister (Eddie Albert) comments on Columbo's seasickness by asking why someone with the name \\"Columbo\\" would not be at home on a boat, the detective responds, \\"It must have been another branch of the family.\\" In other episodes, Columbo does claim that his family has a tradition of being descended from Columbus. He is (or pretends to be) squeamish, and does not like hospitals or autopsies. He finds it distasteful to look at photographs of autopsies while eating (\\"Dagger of the Mind\\"). He demonstrates an aversion to viewing surgical procedures and an apparent fear of needles. In \\"A Stitch in Crime\\", Columbo says he \\"faints\\" merely by being in a hospital. He claims to be afraid of heights, once remarking to an FAA investigator who offered him a job, \\"I don't even like being this tall\\" (\\"Swan Song\\", 1974). Columbo claims he is always nervous when he is in the passenger seat rather than driving, and in fact is extremely nervous during certain investigations. In \\"A Stitch in Crime\\", Columbo grumbles throughout the episode about being sleep-deprived and working too hard. (Columbo suffers from severe allergies \\"every spring\\", although when we first see him suffering symptoms in this episode, he does not know what they are. He says he will not take allergy medicine because of the side effects.) This is also the one and only time‚Äîat least in the NBC decade‚ÄîColumbo challenges his suspect with physical violence (by slamming a water carafe on Dr. Mayfield's desk with great force before directly accusing Mayfield of murder and attempted murder). The killer, Dr. Mayfield had begun sarcastically (and almost uncontrollably) laughing at Columbo's vocal suspicion that Mayfield had murdered a nurse for correctly suspecting him of the attempted murder of his boss, the head of research at the hospital. It is later revealed that Columbo's outburst was an intentional effort to get Mayfield to lose his composure; the doctor's unflappable demeanor, and uncharacteristic response to a later provocation, would in fact be his undoing. In \\"Double Shock\\", Columbo is genuinely alarmed and upset by the housekeeper's dislike of him. He confronts her to ask why she must behave in so hostile a fashion; finally he convinces her that he is simply doing his job. Columbo's unsettling, uneven-eyed stare was due to Falk's glass eye in the right eye socket. It remained a mystery for 25 years whether the character had one as well, until 1997's \\"Columbo: A Trace of Murder\\", whereupon asking a criminologist to accompany him to interrogate a suspect, he jokes: \\"That'll be good, you and me together, Pat. Three eyes are better than one...\\" In almost every episode of the later ABC series, Columbo is heard whistling the children's song \\"This Old Man\\". It often appears as a motif in the musical score and considered an unofficial title score. The song was first included when Falk stood around in character, whistling the tune without it being in the script and was later considered so fitting for the character that the series used it in almost every episode. In \\"Murder Under Glass\\", an orchestral version is used for a banquet scene. In the penultimate Columbo film, 2000's \\"Murder with Too Many Notes\\", Columbo reveals to a music student (and friend of the murder victim) that his wife always hums \\"This Old Man\\" when she is cleaning their house. The movie ends with Columbo asking the student to teach him how to play the song so he can play it for her on her next birthday. This is contradicted by the 1977 episode \\"Try and Catch Me\\", in which Columbo can be seen playing the first two lines of \\"This Old Man\\" on a piano, which shows that he already knows how to play the song. In many of the first season films, Columbo is revealed to also love classical music, and has a high level of knowledge about it. Columbo frequently mentions his wife. In a number of episodes, the murderer is a celebrity or figure well-known to Columbo's wife, and in several Columbo attempts to procure a souvenir for her, or to enlist the celebrity to make a telephone call to her. However, she is never at home. Columbo also has a habit of receiving police calls on the landline of the witness or suspect's house while he is visiting them. \\"√âtude in Black\\" (1972) marked the first appearance of the lieutenant's basset hound, named \\"Dog\\". \\"Dog\\" came to be an occasional regular character in the films. Columbo considered names like \\"Fido\\", \\"Munch\\" and \\"Beethoven\\" but ultimately settled on \\"Dog\\". In \\"Sex and the Married Detective\\", Columbo is put on the spot when he is asked to play the tuba. Reluctantly he agrees, only to demonstrate great proficiency. He subsequently claimed that at school, the tuba was the only instrument left. In several episodes, Columbo is seen eating a breakfast of a boiled egg, usually while investigating the scene of the crime or even while interviewing a suspect. He generally produces the egg from his raincoat pocket, before seeking a hard surface upon which to break its shell; in \\"A Stitch in Crime\\" he uses a piece of evidence found at the murder scene. He prefers to eat the egg salted, stating in \\"Lovely but Lethal\\" that he usually carries a shaker of salt in his pocket. In \\"Double Exposure\\", Columbo claims that he is a big fan of Western (i.e., cowboy) movies. =First name= ID card and badge with the name \\"Frank Columbo\\" in the episode \\"Dead Weight\\" Columbo's first name \\"Frank\\" is never explicitly mentioned during the series. Even the opening credits just simply read, \\"Peter Falk as Columbo\\". When asked, Columbo always emphatically answers \\"Lieutenant\\". In the episode \\"By Dawn's Early Light\\", when he is asked if he has a first name, he replies that the only person who \\"calls\\" him \\"that\\" is his wife. However, the first name \\"Frank\\" is often seen relatively clearly on his police ID. In the 1971 episode \\"Dead Weight\\", when Columbo introduces himself to General Hollister, the audience is shown a brief close-up of Columbo's badge and police ID; the signature reads \\"Frank Columbo\\". The signature \\"Frank Columbo\\" is most clearly visible in the episode \\"A Matter of Honor\\", in which it is also seen that Columbo's badge number is 416. This later appears on the address of a neighbor of the local police comisario (played by Pedro Armend√°riz Jr.). Universal Studios, in the box set of seasons 1‚Äì4 under their Playback label, included a picture of Columbo's police badge on the back of the box, with signature \\"Frank Columbo\\" and \\"Lt. Frank Columbo\\" in type. This appears to be a different badge from the one seen in \\"Dead Weight\\", with a different signature (a common occurrence with props). The name \\"Frank\\" is also clearly seen in the episode from 1991 called \\"Death Hits The Jackpot\\" when Lt. Columbo shows how shiny his badge is when explaining to Rip Torn's character how he was able to figure out how he was in the victim's apartment at the time of the murder. When Columbo holds his badge up, the name \\"Frank\\" is clearly typed on his LAPD I.D. card at the top. In Episode 60, \\"No Time to Die\\", the lieutenant's nephew (played by Thomas Calabro) calls Columbo \\"uncle Cosmo\\". Several sources cite the lieutenant's name as \\"Philip Columbo\\". Columbo's first name Philip was conceived by Fred L. Worth. In Worth's book, The Trivia Encyclopedia, the fictitious entry about Columbo's first name was actually a copyright trap ‚Äì a deliberately false statement intended to reveal subsequent copyright infringement, the basis for his later action against the publishers of the board game Trivial Pursuit. (cert. denied.) =Career= After serving in the United States army during the Korean War (\\"mostly KP\\", as he says), Columbo joined the New York City Police Department and was assigned to the 12th precinct. He trained under Sergeant Gilhooley, a genial Irishman who mentored him and taught him a great deal about police work. Columbo reminisces about Gilhooley and mentions him often. Columbo moved to Los Angeles in 1958, at the behest of his cousin Fred who convinced him he'd prefer it to New York. Early in his career, he worked in the L.A.P.D.'s Hollenbeck Division (part of the Central Bureau, covering the communities of Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights and El Sereno). In Falk's first appearance as Columbo in the 1968 TV-movie, Prescription Murder, the character had the rank of police lieutenant. In Uneasy Lies the Crown released in 1990, Columbo tells a colleague that he has been \\"on the force\\" (presumably meaning the LAPD) for 22 years, which would suggest that he began his career on the LAPD as a lieutenant in the homicide department, having never worked as a uniformed officer for that police force. This is contradicted by the 1974 episode Negative Reaction, in which he claims that he has been \\"on the force\\" for 15 years already by that time. In Prescription Murder, Columbo speaks of a colleague, Lieutenant Silver, who was supposed to be assigned to the case but was thought to be \\"too young and inexperienced\\" compared to Columbo. In mentioning Lt. Silver, Columbo begins a tradition that will return often, of the rejection of lesser officers from his investigations. However, he also often involves younger detectives in his investigations and usually finds some reason to praise them. This in turn allows the other common motif of suspects attempting to have Columbo removed from investigating, because they fear him. Despite solving numerous murders over the next few decades, in Falk's last appearance as Columbo in the 2003 cable-TV movie Columbo Likes the Nightlife, the detective is still a lieutenant. A very common motif is that Columbo enjoys and lives for his work. He is happy being a lieutenant with the homicide department, and often makes statements about his lack of ambition. He is precisely where he has always wanted to be, and he will remain there. The attempts to remove him from cases never work because Columbo \\"is something of a legend\\", and thus has a powerful position with the police force. In fact, in Falk's pilot episode, Prescription Murder, he mentions to a suspected accessory that somebody has attempted to have him removed from the case, but he says: Another common motif is Columbo's investigatory tactics with the murderer. Columbo often asks a series of questions which the killer easily answers, or explains, seemingly ending the conversation, only to have Columbo bring up \\"one more thing\\" before asking a final question or presenting a scenario which unsettles or stumps. =Family= In the course of his investigations, Columbo often discussed details of his personal life, some of which were inconsistent with details given in other episodes. Although some of these inconsistencies may have been genuine continuity errors, it is also possible that the writers intended Columbo to be giving misinformation to suspects in order to steer the conversations in his intended direction. Childhood Columbo was born and raised in New York City in a neighborhood near Chinatown. In the episode \\"Murder Under Glass\\", he says that he ate more egg rolls than cannelloni during his childhood. In \\"Any Old Port in a Storm\\" he mentions that he is Italian ‚Äúon both sides‚Äù, and suggests the family is from Southern Italy, calling Milan \\"up north\\". The Columbo household included his grandfather, parents, five brothers (one named George and another named Fred), and a sister, Rose. His father wore glasses and did the cooking when his mother was in the hospital having another baby. His grandfather \\"was a tailgunner on a beer truck during Prohibition\\" and let him stomp the grapes when they made wine in the cellar. His father, who never earned more than $5,000 a year and bought only one new car in his life, taught Columbo how to play pool, at which he excels in \\"How to Dial a Murder\\". While visiting London, Columbo remarks to Scotland Yard officers that his \\"father was an Elk until my mother stopped him\\" (\\"Dagger of the Mind\\"). Wife Columbo frequently mentions his wife. During the first few seasons of the series it was widely speculated that the character actually had no wife. However, there is ample evidence that he does, in fact, have a wife. In three episodes (\\"An Exercise in Fatality\\", \\"Any Old Port in a Storm\\" and \\"Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo\\"), Columbo is seen talking on the telephone with his wife without other characters present; in the episode \\"Troubled Waters\\" (1975) other characters describe meeting and speaking to Mrs. Columbo while they are on a cruise ship, although she remains unseen; and in \\"Identity Crisis\\", murderer Nelson Brenner (Patrick McGoohan) bugs Columbo's home and learns Mrs. Columbo's favorite piece of music is Madama Butterfly from Giacomo Puccini. Other instances, while not providing direct evidence, suggest her existence, such as \\"A Stitch in Crime\\" (1972) in which Columbo tells only his fellow officers, when he first arrives on the scene, that his wife has some kind of flu. He explains he had been up all night caring for her and also has the flu as a result. Other instances provide details about his wife and their life together. In \\"A Matter of Honor\\", Columbo tells his Mexican colleague (Pedro Armend√°riz Jr.) that his wife has left Mexico in order to attend the 10th anniversary celebration of Columbo's cousin, Vito. Columbo explains that his wife is very sensitive about such things, and implies that she is deeply caring about family. In \\"No Time to Die\\", Columbo states that his wife loves to dance, saying it is the only exercise he gets, and states that they were married in an Italian restaurant. In the 1990 episode \\"Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo\\", the lieutenant states that he and his wife were to celebrate their 28th or 29th anniversary next January, placing the year of their marriage between 1961 and 1963. In the same episode, Columbo's wife is targeted by a psychotic killer (Helen Shaver). During the investigation Columbo states that his wife loves Chopin and describes her as being busy with church, volunteering at the hospital, watching her sister's children and walking the dog five times a day. He mentions that she has a sister named Ruth and later while talking with his wife on the phone he refers also to her having another sister, Rita. This episode teases the audience as to whether or not Mrs. Columbo has actually been murdered and by featuring prominently displayed photographs of Mrs. Columbo, apparently finally disclosing her appearance to viewers. However, the photos are revealed to be of one of his wife's sisters, as he informs the killer at the end of the episode. The 1979-80 series Mrs. Columbo featured a detective's wife named Kate (portrayed by Kate Mulgrew). Information about the show initially made clear this was intended to be the wife of the same Columbo, despite clear contradictions with descriptions of Mrs. Columbo on the original show (Mulgrew was 24 at the time, which would have made her 13 in 1968 when Columbo began). After early ratings failure the show and character were re-named and any suggestions of a connection to the Peter Falk Columbo were removed. Children Columbo has children but no details were ever disclosed about them. As with his wife, their actual existence within the show has been questioned, but as with his wife there is evidence that they are real. In the episode \\"Troubled Waters\\" (1975) he is seen discussing the children on the phone with no other characters present. In one episode (\\"Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo‚Äù) he does claim in conversation with the killer that he and his wife never had any children, but it was part of a deception in which he staged a ‚Äúhome‚Äù at a house other than his own which included false pictures of his wife, because the killer had targeted his wife. In \\"Any Old Port in a Storm\\", he refers to the difficulty of getting a babysitter. He also mentions in that episode taking his wife and \\"child\\" on a picnic, and alludes to this child in \\"The Most Crucial Game\\". In \\"Mind over Mayhem\\", he mentions that his \\"wife and kids\\" are in Fresno visiting his mother-in-law. He is also seen asking about the children in a phone conversation with his wife when no one else was present. Other relatives In \\"No Time to Die\\" he attends the wedding of his nephew, who is also a police officer. In the speech Columbo holds at the wedding feast, he mentions his late sister Mary. In \\"Short Fuse\\", he states that his wife's younger brother is a photography buff and in \\"Blueprint for Murder\\" he says he has a brother-in-law who is an attorney. At the end of \\"Dead Weight\\", he states that he has a niece named Cynthia, who is the daughter of his wife's sister. In \\"Requiem for a Falling Star\\", he tells the murderess that he has a brother-in-law named George who is a fan and has her speak to him over the phone. In \\"Lovely but Lethal\\", Columbo speaks of his nephew who is resident dermatologist at UCLA. Columbo often explains that he has an immense family and speaks of several siblings. Two brothers figure quite often: George and Fred (the brother who convinced Columbo to move to California from New York). Columbo sometimes refers to a cousin, also named Fred. Car The Peugeot 403 Cabriolet used in filming. Peter Falk and Dog in Season 7 Episode 4 titled \\"How to Dial a Murder\\" that aired on April 15, 1978 On duty, Columbo drives his own car, a French 1959 Peugeot 403 convertible equipped with a police radio. In early episodes the car used was clearly royal blue, though faded; later it seems to be \\"primer\\"-colored. Columbo says he parks his car in the shade because the sun ruins the paint. The California license plate, clearly seen in the first episode to be 044 APD, is damaged and crooked in later episodes. Peter Falk selected the car personally, after seeing it in a parking lot at Universal Studios. In the season 5 episode \\"Identity Crisis\\", Columbo boasts that the car is a rare automobile, \\"only three like it in the States\\". From June 1956 to July 1961, only 2,050 were produced, and only 504 were produced for model year 1959. Though it regularly exhibits mechanical problems large and small, Columbo professes faith in his vehicle, telling a valet, \\"I've got over 100,000 miles on it. You take care of your car, it'll take care of you.\\" This car can also be seen in a stock shot used at the beginning of the pilot of The Rockford Files, \\"The Backlash of the Hunter\\". The car also made an appearance in an episode of Adam-12. In \\"Columbo Goes to College\\" (1990), he reveals that this is not his only car, as his wife has a \\"little runaround for the shopping\\". When the series returned on ABC, James and Connie Delaney of Findlay, Ohio, owned the car, but were unwilling to sell it, though they lent it to Universal for filming.

Mobilized during both World War I and World War II, Platone, known by his nom de guerre ‚ÄúGamba‚Äù during and after the Second World War Italian resistance movement, was discharged with the rank of major of artillery. During the 18-year Mussolini dictatorship, the legal profession did not hinder Platone from performing clandestine anti-fascist activities.

XVI, no. 4, February 1904 Comfort was a mail order magazine published in Augusta, Maine from 1888 to 1942. Published by Gannet & Morris and edited initially by William H. Gannet, Comfort was touted as \\"the key to happiness and success in over a million and quarter homes.\\" In 1888, William H. Gannet created Comfort primarily as a means to advertise his patent medicine, Giant Oxien, a variant of The Moxie Nerve Food. Comforts circulation increased from 13,000, in 1888, to 1.3 million, in 1894, which made Comfort the first publication in America to reach a circulation of 1 million. In order to handle this increase in circulation, Gannet purchased a new rotary color convertible web-fed press, which was one of the first of its kind in the country. The increase in Comforts circulation was primarily due to its use of premiums to generate subscriptions. Premiums, essentially rewards like sewing machines or clothing, were given to people who submitted \\"clubs\\" or lists of new subscribers. As Frank Luther Mott notes in his book, A History of American Magazines, the use of the \\"'club' device made the solicitor virtually a local subscription agent for the periodical.\\" Most of the time, publishers of mail- order magazines did not depend on the collection of subscription fees and instead generated income by selling their subscription lists to advertisers. The practice of not collecting subscriptions fees went against the United States Post Office Department's criteria that required publications to maintain \\"a legitimate list of subscribers\\" in order to take advantage of the low second-class mailing rate of one-cent per pound. In 1907, as a way to curb further abuse of the second-class postal rate, the US Post Office mandated that all subscription fees must be paid in advance. Many mail-order magazines could not meet this requirement and folded. The publishers of Comfort, who were more firm about collecting payment than other mail-order magazine publishers, lowered Comforts price to 15 cents a year in order to meet with the new regulations. To prevent mail-order magazines from becoming little more than advertisement catalogs, the US Post Office also required mail-order magazines provide readers with \\"information of a public character, or devoted to literature, the sciences, arts, or some special industry.\\" This regulation may explain why Comfort claimed on its front page to be \\"devoted to art, literature, science, and the home circle.\\" In addition to the columns of advertisements, Comfort provided readers with various articles geared to meet the needs and interests of every member of the rural, American family. With articles like \\"In & Around the Home,\\" \\"Comfort Sisters' Recipes,\\" and \\"The Pretty Girls' Club,\\" much of Comfort was dominated by content for women, which offered advice and information on cooking, sewing, health, and beauty. Comfort also printed articles aimed at men, although not as many, such as \\"The Modern Farmer\\" and \\"Automobile and Gas Engine Helps.\\" For children, Comfort occasionally published puzzles, activities, and comics. Another prominent feature of Comfort was its short and serialized fiction. When Comfort was first published, much of the fiction was written by William H. Gannet as a means to further plug Giant Oxien and other products displayed in the magazine's advertisements. From roughly September 1892 to April 1902, Comfort offered prizes to readers who submitted works of fiction for publication. In later years, Comfort went on to publish fiction written by more legitimate and well known authors such as Augusta Jane Evans, Mrs. Georgie Sheldon, Horatio Alger Jr., Charles Felton Pidgin, and L. M. Montgomery. The fiction published in Comfort was usually highly moral and typically fell into three genres: Adventure, Mystery, or Sentimental Romance. Additionally, Comfort printed stories for children. The Cubby Bear stories, written by Lena B. Ellingwood and illustrated by Harrison Cady, were the most regular children's fiction published in Comfort. In 1940, Comfort was sold to the Needlecraft Publishing Corporation. Needlecraft Publishing continued to publish Comfort for two years until it was combined with Needlecraft magazine, which ceased to be published soon after.

She was chief of a team of undercover investigators who investigated mediums for Houdini in the 1920s. After Houdini's death she continued to investigate spiritualist fraud for over 20 years and was known as an expert on the subject. She testified in court cases and before Congress and was interviewed in national magazines and on television.  Early life  Mackenberg was born July 10, 1892, and lived in Brooklyn, New York City. In her early years she worked as a stenographer in a law office and as an investigator in New York City. She later reported that, in her early life, she had believed that psychics and fortunetellers really were able to communicate with spirits and foretell the future.  Houdini's investigator  In the early 1920s Mackenberg was working on a case involving investment losses that had been advised by a psychic medium. She sought out Houdini's help in the case, as he was very publicly engaged in a campaign against false mediums. Houdini was impressed with the young woman, and educated her on the tricks that mediums use to manipulate their victims. In 1925 Houdini hired her for his undercover investigator team. The team included several other women besides Mackenberg, including Houdini's niece Julia Sawyer and a showgirl named Alberta Chapman. Houdini also sometimes employed men including Clifford M. Eddy, Jr., Robert H. Gysel, and Amadeo Vacca. While Houdini was on tour in 1925 and 1926, Mackenberg and the other investigators would precede him by up to 10 days into each city, and perform undercover investigations of the local spiritualists or psychic mediums. They would use multiple false names, sometimes containing puns like \\"Frances Raud\\" (for FRAUD) and \\"Alicia Bunck\\" (for All Is A Bunk). They would also wear various disguises to avoid being found out. Mackenberg would sometimes even wear a hearing aid she didn't need. Mackenberg did investigations for Houdini and sometimes appeared on stage with him in many cities on those tours including Indianapolis, Worcester, Mass. Washington, D.C. Chicago, New York and Montreal. Her very detailed written reports for Houdini have been studied and exhibited in museums. When Houdini later performed in each city, he would debunk local mediums from the stage, presenting the gathered evidence. Naturally Houdini and his investigators became the target of great anger from the spiritualists. It was said he carried a Derringer and he advised Mackenberg to carry a gun as well, but she refused. Mackenberg earned the respect of Houdini and his team, and was considered his chief investigator. The other investigators sometimes called her \\"The Rev\\" because of the multiple bogus spiritualist diplomas and titles she had acquired during her investigations. Prior to his death, Houdini set up secret codes with more than twenty friends to attempt to communicate with them from beyond the grave. Mackenberg was among those chosen, and in 1945 she reported \\"the message has not come through.\\"  Expert on psychic fraud  Mackenberg in s√©ance disguises Because of her investigative work, Mackenberg became an expert on the practices of fraudulent psychics. She claimed to have investigated over 1,000 mediums and never found one who was not a fraud. For example, the various mediums had claimed to communicate with over three dozen non-existent deceased husbands, despite Mackenberg being single. According to William Lindsay Gresham, Julien Proskauer credited Mackenberg for \\"much of his material\\" in his book The Dead Do Not Talk. = Congressional testimony = In the first session of the 69th Congress, an anti-fortunetelling law for Washington, D.C., was put forward on the urging of Houdini. The Copeland-Bloom bill (H.R. 8989) came before a House committee beginning February 26, 1926. Houdini was to testify in its favor. Following the same pattern as during the tour, Mackenberg visited local Washington mediums in the days prior to the hearings. She targeted local mediums including Jane B. Coates and Madam Grace Marcia who were scheduled to testify against the bill. Her testimony on May 18, 1926, included the revelation that Coates had told her that Senators Capper, Watson, Dill, and Fletcher \\"had come to her for readings\\" and that \\"table tipping seances are held at the White House\\" with President Coolidge and his family. This was met with raucous denials in the committee room, and a \\"fracas\\" ensued. The meeting was adjourned. President Coolidge did not officially respond to the accusation but unofficial denials were made known in the press. Ultimately H.R. 8989 did not pass, but the hearings received wide press coverage. = Lockwood's estate = After Houdini's death in October 1926, Mackenberg continued to investigate fraudulent psychics for over 20 years and serve as an expert on them in various venues. One court case in Pennsylvania involved the 1939 will of Augustus T. Lockwood. He had bequeathed a large sum of money to a \\"Spiritualistic College to Educate Mediums\\" at Lily Dale, New York, a famous camp and meeting place for Spiritualists. The state of Pennsylvania sought to invalidate the will, in part on the argument that the bequest would benefit criminal behavior and thus would be \\"against public policy\\". Mackenberg was called as the \\"star witness\\" and the state was successful at trial. The case was appealed, however, and overturned by higher courts.  Public outreach  In addition to her investigations, Mackenberg attempted to educate the public on psychic fraud. She toured the country giving lectures on psychic fraud to various groups, a typical talk title was ‚ÄúDebunking the Ghost Racket‚Äù. These talks would include demonstrations of techniques used by psychics including spirit trumpets, table tipping, billet reading and so on. She wrote a series of articles on the \\"ghost racket\\" which were serialized to newspapers in 1929 and posthumously anthologized and re- published in 2016. A manuscript titled So You Want to Attend a Seance? gathered these reports, but the manuscript itself has never been published. She also assisted with investigations which were published in major media outlets such as Popular Science, The Chicago Tribune and The Saturday Evening Post. She appeared on television talk shows including Mike and Buff and Tonight Starring Steve Allen.  Personal life  She remained single and continued to live in the New York City area in a \\"well lighted\\" apartment (\\"because I get tired of dark rooms\\"). Her friends called her \\"Mac\\". Mackenberg died in April 1968.  Representations in popular culture  In 2017, Rose Mackenberg was featured alongside Houdini in re-enactment sequences during season 14, episode 13 of the Travel Channel's documentary series Mysteries at the Museum. The re-enactments included Mackenberg's investigations of spiritualist seances and her 1926 congressional testimony.

Biography Ben-Ami was born in 1890 and grew up in Russia, performing in various acting troupes, before emigrating to the United States in 1912. He had a long and distinguished international career, including acting in, staging and directing a number of Broadway plays. In 1918, he founded or co-founded the Jewish Art Theatre. Ben-Ami's first English-language production was the 1920 Broadway play Samson and Delilah. According to biographer Alan Gansberg in Little Caesar: A Biography of Edward G. Robinson, Ben-Ami earned Robinson's disdain by allegedly trying to upstage the other actors and overacting. Both the play and Ben-Ami, however, were hits. In her 1921 review of the production, Dorothy Parker proclaimed him \\"one of the greatest actors on the stage today.\\" He was also lauded by John Barrymore (\\"inspired\\"), The New York Times and Alexander Woollcott (\\"the cocktail question of the year was 'Ben-Ami or not Ben-Ami'\\"), among others. He had much less success in Eugene O'Neill's 1924 play Welded, in which he starred. Among other problems, the style of play did not suit Ben-Ami, and he had a thick accent. Welded closed after three weeks and 24 performances. On the other hand, his last Broadway play was The Tenth Man, written by Paddy Chayefsky; it had one of the longer runs on Broadway at 623 performances from November 5, 1959, to May 13, 1961. As an established star, Ben-Ami helped the then-unknown John Garfield get accepted into the American Laboratory Theater. He also co- directed the 1937 film Green Fields with Edgar G. Ulmer and appeared in the films The Wandering Jew (1933) and Esperanza (1949), and on television. His niece is the actress and film director Jennifer Warren.

He ruled in a period of \\"rotating lineages\\" as planned by his predecessor and was of the Kimpanzu. He had once fought against Pedro during the recapture of S√£o Salvador. Rule in Mbamba Lovata Manuel was the brother of Daniel I, and when he was killed in the Sack of S√£o Salvador, became the main Kimpanzu claimant to the Kongo throne. He retreated to Mbamba Lovata, where he established himself as the Awenekongo which became one of three main post-civil war states, the other two held by separate Kinlaza claimants to the throne of Kongo. In 1680, King Pedro III was ruling the rival kingdom of Lemba, where he claimed the Kongo throne in opposition to the House of Kimpanzu partisans residing in Soyo's southern province of Luvota. Manuel had swore vengeance and orchestrated a plot to kill Pedro III. Under the auspice of a truce, treacherously negotiated by the Prince of Soyo, Pedro III was lured into a trap expecting to make peace through marriage to a Kimpanzu noble. Instead, Manuel emerged from the Soyo wedding train dressed as a bride and shot Pedro III to death before escaping.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 79. Cambridge University, 1998 The particular episode in Kongo's history would become one of the sticking points keeping the nobility from finding a lasting peace. After the assassination of Pedro III, Manuel fought to establish his claim over Kongo, which eventually culminated in a Battle for S√£o Salvador, where he allied with Pedro Constantinho da Silva and his partisans who were once subordinates of Pedro IV. The forces of Pedro and Manuel clashed, but eventually Pedro was victorious, leaving him in control of the capital and therefore de facto Manikongo of Kongo. Manuel did not give up his claim for 6 years, and continued to rule a rival administration in Mbamba Lovata until an agreement between Pedro and Manuel in 1715 led to the reestablishment of the throne alternating between the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu houses. Rule in S√£o Salvador When Pedro died in 1718, the agreement between the houses was honored, and Manuel was crowned as Manuel II of Kongo, moving his royal house to the city. He ruled until his death in 1743, when the throne passed to Garcia IV, who was of the House of Kinlaza.

Coin (born December 10, 1949) is a former American football player and coach. He played as a linebacker and placekicker for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1969 to 1971. He set a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record in 1971 by successfully converting 55 of 55 extra point attempts. He also extended the Michigan school record for the longest field goal in 1970 and kicked a game-winning field goal in November 1971 that clinched a Big Ten Conference championship for the Wolverines. He later served as the defensive coordinator at Eastern Michigan University. University of Michigan Coin enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1968 and played for the school's all-freshman team that fall. He was a member of the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1969 to 1971.(enter \\"coin\\" in the box for \\"last name\\" to retrieve Coin's career roster information) Coin played for Michigan at a time when the school's head coach, Bo Schembechler, held the view that there would be no kicking specialists on his team and that a kicker had to be a football player first. Accordingly, and although his greatest talent lay in his kicking, he also played at the linebacker position. As a freshman in 1968, Coin played on Michigan's freshman football team. As a sophomore in 1969, he was a backup linebacker and handled kickoffs for the Wolverines. As a junior in 1970, he began the season handling kickoffs and field goal attempts and took over responsibility for extra points in the middle of the season. On September 19, 1970, he kicked a 42-yard field goal that was, at the time, the longest field goal in Michigan football history. Coin's 42-yard field goal broke a school record of 40 yards set in 1961 by Doug Bickle, and not surpassed until a 50-yard kick by Mike Lantry in 1973. As a senior in 1971, Coin set an NCAA record by successfully converting 55 of 55 extra points without a miss. He was also the team's leading scorer with 79 points. He kicked a career-high nine extra points against Iowa on November 6, 1971, surpassing the prior season record of 50 extra points set by Al Limahelu of San Diego State. Coin's 55 extra points in 1971 remains a Michigan single- season record. Coin also started two games at outside linebacker in 1971. Over the course of his career at Michigan, Coin totaled 54 tackles and a fumble recovery. He also successfully converted 70 of 72 extra points and 13 of 27 field goal attempts. On November 13, 1971, Coin preserved Michigan's undefeated record and clinched a Big Ten Conference championship for the school when he kicked two field goals against Purdue, including the game- winning field goal with 46 seconds left in the game. His final game in a Michigan uniform was the 1972 Rose Bowl. Coin kicked a 30-yard field goal and an extra point in the Rose Bowl, but Michigan lost to Stanford, 13‚Äì12. Later years In August 1972, Coin was hired as an assistant football coach at a high school in Dowagiac, Michigan. In 1973, he became a graduate assistant for the Michigan Wolverines football team. In 1974, he became the defensive coordinator of the Eastern Michigan University Hurons football team and held that position for two-and-a-half years. After retiring from football, Coin worked as a manufacturer's representative. He later went into the automotive electronics business. He has been married three times and has four children and two stepchildren. As of 2004, he was living in Clarkston, Michigan.

It premiered on February 3, 2011 by Lucky Forward Films. The documentary follows 17 men from the United States Army, Oregon Army National Guard who volunteered to train a kandak (battalion) of troops from the Afghan National Army. It was the winner of the \\"Best Documentary\\" at the Queen's World Film Festival, winner of the \\"Golden Ace Award\\" at the Las Vegas Film Festival, and the winner of the \\"Military Channel Award\\" at the 2011 GI Film Festival. Plot In 2008, 17 volunteers from the Oregon National Guard volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan to train troops of the Afghan National Army in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. They became an Embedded Training Team, or ETT, and were stationed at Camp Phoenix in Kabul. The kandak of Afghan troops was a light infantry unit roughly 200 men strong, and they were equipped with primarily AK-47 rifles, PK machine guns, and Ford Ranger trucks for transportation. The Americans trained the Afghans to be a counter narcotics task force, and they went to Helmand Province to halt illegal opium production and sale which provided the Taliban with money. The US government instead gave the Afghan farmers corn to farm. The tall cornfields, however, turned into ideal ambush locations for Taliban fighters. Unfortunately, the \\"counter narcotics\\" unit began smoking the confiscated marijuana and the US troops were powerless to stop them. After much combat alongside soldiers from the Royal Irish Regiment and the Royal Danish Army, the ETT team began leaving the Helmand area to return to Kabul. On the way, an IED destroyed an MRAP and killed CPT Bruno de Solenni from Crescent City, California. The soldiers return home to Oregon, and all try to adjust to civilian life each in their own way. Their accomplishments in Afghanistan were notable, and Captain Paul Dyer mentions how in the first engagement with the Taliban, many of the Afghan soldiers fled or did not fight back, but by the time the Americans were ready to leave, the Afghans had come full-circle, and managed to defend the city of Lashkar Gah against the Taliban with minimal U.S. help. The ETT that these volunteers made up, is one of the most decorated units in National Guard history.

This intersection is northwest of Millwood Elementary School. It travels to the north and immediately curves to the northwest before leaving the Millwood vicinity. The highway immediately travels through Sumter for approximately before re-entering Millwood. When it crosses over Green Swamp, it leaves Millwood a second time. It immediately travels along the southwestern edge of the city limits of Sumter before entering Sumter proper. The highway turns left onto Patriot Parkway, which is northeast of Patriot Park. The highway travels to the west and leaves Sumter. SC 441 curves to the west-northwest and crosses some railroad tracks. It curves to the north-northwest and intersects U.S. Route 76 (US 76) and US 378 just southwest of Shaw Air Force Base. It curves to the north and north- northwest before traveling through a small portion of the base, with most turn-offs blocked by fences and/or jersey barriers. The highway travels along the northwestern edge of the base and then along the eastern edge of Oakland. It passes by Oakland Primary School before leaving Oakland and curving to the north-northwest. SC 441 travels through Catchall before it curves to the northeast. It travels along the northwestern edge of Dalzell and has an interchange with US 521 (Thomas Sumter Highway). Immediately after the interchange, it passes Thomas Sumter Academy. It travels through rural areas of the county before it intersects Dubose Siding Road at Stanyarne Burrows Crossroad. Just after that, it enters Lee County. The highway crosses over Rocky Bluff Swamp before traveling through Woodrow.

Career By 1952, judges on the island of Java had begun to organize; Suryadi had initially been the chairman of the trial court in Semarang at that time.Daniel Lev, Legal Evolution and Political Authority in Indonesia, pg. 77. Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2000. Suryadi was the first chairman of IKAHI, the Judges' Association, at its inception in May 1953.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court: A Study of Institutional Collapse, pg. 47. Ithaca: Cornell Southeast Asia Program, 2005. He became the first chairman because, during his time as the chairman of the Surabaya district court, he was the first person to organize district judges in 1952. In 1955, he toured the United States and was deeply impressed by the far reach of the Federal judiciary of the United States; his references to the American system were frequent after his return.Daniel Lev, Legal Evolution, pg. 83. Additionally, his resentment toward the influence prosecutors increased, and their tendency to cite practices of the judiciary of the Netherlands instead caused clashes of viewpoints. Suryadi was appointed by the first President of Indonesia, Sukarno, as the third Chief Justice on June 21, 1966. He continued as the Chief Justice throughout the turbulent period known as the Transition to the New Order,Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pgs. 47-48. and eventually found himself in outright confrontation with the Judges' Association.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 48. Like his predecessor Wirjono Prodjodikoro, Suryadi resigned as Chief Justice after a power struggle with the Association's leadership,Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 69. in part exacerbated due to personal and private disputes with Association members Asikin Kusumah Atmaja and Sri Widoyati Sukito.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 84. The Judges' Association which Suryadi himself helped found was opposed to him, in part, because of perceptions that he was being used by Sukarno; heated personal confrontations had previously taken place when Suryadi had served at the same Jakarta district courts as Atmaja and Sukito due to their impression that he was allowing his politics to interfere with his work. He'd been chosen by Sukarno over his eventual successor, Subekti, against the recommendations of the Parliament of Indonesia during the era of guided democracy.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 83. Part of Sukarno's reasoning was that Subekti played \\"poker\\",Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 82. leading to the impression among the judiciary that Suryadi had been chosen due to his relationship with Sukarno in the Indonesian National Party. The friction ultimately led to his resignation. The Judges' Association planned to hold a meeting to discuss numerous issues, including Suryadi's attempt to order unfavorable transfers to a number of district judges and the Justice Minister's rejection of it, in November 1966.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 86. Suryadi threatened to boycott the meeting, but attended for a time when the Association didn't budge. While he was physically present, none dared to air any criticism of him; once he walked out, his colleagues began to berate him. After the fall of Sukarno, the Parliament began to consider Atmaja and Sukito for nomination to the Supreme Court, at which point Suryadi announced that he'd refuse to serve alongside them. The Parliament then followed through with the appointment of both individuals, upon which Suryadi resigned and was promptly replaced by Subekti. Legacy The comprehensive demands of the Indonesian judiciary in terms of their role in the state were drawn up by Suryadi at a separate November 1966 conference.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 87. Ironically, it was Suryadi rather than the Judges' Association that articulated the judiciary's view of its own role which remains consistent until the present day.Sebastian Pompe, The Indonesian Supreme Court, pg. 88. A number of his former opponents regretted their conflict with him in light of his coherent expression of what could have been the most major political milestone in Indonesia's post independence history. Suryadi's predictions about the conflict between judges and prosecutors have also been described as \\"prophetic.\\"Daniel Lev, Legal Evolution, pg. 82. In the 1950s, Indonesian prosecutors argued for equality between their salaries and those of judges; Suryadi argued that reducing the relative prestige of judges would result in difficulty recruiting capable candidates. Even by the early 1950s, more law graduates pursued careers as prosecutors and the Indonesian judiciary faced an acute shortage of trained personnel. After his retirement, Suryadi was hired at the law firm of rights activist Adnan Buyung Nasution.

Also, included is The Goldwater Crypt in the Memorial Garden on the grounds of the Christ Church of the Ascension. Brief history The land which is now named Paradise Valley, began as an agricultural community. According to Will Barnes, author of \\"Arizona Place Names\\", Frank Conkey, gave the place its name in the 1880s. Conkey managed the surveyors in charge of developing the land into agricultural lots for the Rio Verde Canal Company.Will Barnes, Arizona Place Names, revised and enlarged by Byrd Granger, University of Arizona Press, 1960, p. 190. After World War II, the area began to experience a population growth. The new residents founded the \\"Citizens Committee for the Incorporation of The Town of Paradise Valley, Arizona\\". After the committee presented a petition to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisor for the recognition of township, the petition was granted and on May 24, 1961, the town of Paradise Valley was incorporated. The first and currently (as of 2016) only property in Paradise Valley to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places is the Edward L. Jones House which was built in 1925. According to the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, Edward L.Jones, had retired to Arizona with his wife, May, and three sons in 1930 from Oklahoma, where he had been in the oil business, homesteaded in the Cave Creek/Carefree area. He and his wife were attracted to the area just south of MacDonald Drive and bought about fifty desert acres from Edward Loomis Bowes, who had settled in Arizona from Evanston, Illinois, for his wife's health, in 1920, in what would in the future be incorporated as the town of Paradise Valley.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form In 1964, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater ran unsuccessfully for the Presidency of the United States. Goldwater had a house built atop of Scorpion Hill in 1952. The house, which was constructed with sandstone from the Navajo Reservation, is located on Keim Street, just east of 40th Street in Paradise Valley. His ashes and that of his wife, Peggy, who died in 1985, are interned in the \\"Goldwater crypt\\" in the Memorial Garden on the grounds of the Christ Church of the Ascension. The church is located at 4015 E. Lincoln Drive. Two houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright are located in Paradise Valley, they are the \\"Harold C. Price Sr. House\\" and the last house that Wright designed before his death, the Norman Lykes House. The Harold C. Price Sr. House was built in 1956 and is located at 7211 N. Tatum. Price was the owner of the ‚ÄúPrice Tower‚Äù in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The construction of the Norman Lykes House began in 1959 and competed in 1967. It is located at 6836 N. 36th Street in Paradise Valley, Arizona. The house was finished by Taliesin Associated Architects John Rattenbury. Norman Lykes was one of seven brothers who operated the ‚ÄúLykes Brothers Steamship Lines‚Äù, a shipping company which dates back to 1889. The historic Paradise Valley Methodist Church was built in 1960 and is located at 4455 East Lincoln Road. The church's chapel with its stained glass window was built in 1964. Both are featured in the \\"Valley of the Sun\\", television program about Phoenix and its surrounding areas in the 1960s. Bil Keane and his wife Thelma a.k.a. \\"Thel\\" lived in Paradise Valley. There house is located at 5815 E. Joshua Tree Ln. Bil is the creator of the daily newspaper panel The Family Circus which premiered on February 29, 1960. His wife Thelma, was the inspiration and model for the \\"Mommy\\" character in his long running comic strip and was instrumental in restoring the copyrights for The Family Circus to her husband. The McCune Mansion/Hormel Mansion was built in 1967 and is located at 6112 N. Paradise View Drive atop Sugar Loaf Mountain. The house was built for Pennzoil heir Walter McCune who died sometime before the house was complete in the early 70's. Barry Goldwater and Alice Cooper lived on the same block. It was later sold to Hormel Food Co. heir George Hormel. At 52,000 square feet, it is the 13th largest privately owned home in the United States by square footage.

Life in the United Kingdom Pringle was born in the town of Hawick, Roxburghshire, not far from the border with England. His father had inherited a part-ownership of Robert Pringle and Sons, a family knitwear business. Between the ages of 14 and 19 he was educated in England at Shrewsbury School, where he received a classical education consisting almost entirely of classes in Latin and Greek. It taught, he said, \\"the accurate use of words and the ability to concentrate on difficult subjects [but] it did not stimulate our creative powers (if any) or even our curiosity\\".John Douglas Pringle, \\"A Classical Education\\", Quadrant, May‚ÄìJune 1971, p. 60. He went up to Lincoln College, Oxford, where he took a First in Greats. In August 1934 he joined The Manchester Guardian. He soon discovered that he had \\"no nose for news\\": he tried but failed to learn shorthand, loathed pursuing leads over the telephone, and lacked the push to get interviews from people in the news. However, he succeeded as a leader writer. During the Second World War he served as an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers. He saw action in France in 1940, then spent most of the rest of the war training troops in Inveraray in western Scotland.John Douglas Pringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, Chatto & Windus, London, 1973, p. 25. In 1944 he returned to The Guardian as assistant editor,Pringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, pp. 26-28. then in 1948 he went to The Times as a special writer, chiefly on foreign affairs. Life in Australia Pringle was tempted to go to Australia by the challenge of editing The Sydney Morning Herald, which was then considered the country's best newspaper, but also for health reasons: for a year from early 1950 he underwent treatment for tuberculosisPringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, pp. 66-75. and, for the rest of his life, survived on one working lung. He edited The Sydney Morning Herald from 1952 to 1957, but was frustrated by the paper's management, who insisted on confining the editor's power to the editorial and leader page, with no control over the news pages. To Pringle, this was \\"responsibility without power\\" and, when his five-year contract expired in 1957, he did not renew it. Before he left at the end of 1957 he wrote what remained his \\"best-known and most influential book\\", Australian AccentPringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, pp. 131-33. (published in 1958) \\"a frank discussion of Australian attitudes, politics, cultural and social mores\\".The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, Oxford, Melbourne, 1994, p. 631. He moved back to London to become deputy editor of The Observer from 1958 to 1963. He returned to Australia in 1963. He spent a year hosting a public affairs television program on ATN7 in Sydney, Seven Days, but was uncomfortable on camera and soon decided \\"that most of the claims made for television were false and that there was something inherent in the medium which made superficiality and triviality inevitable\\".Pringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, pp. 159-60. He became managing editor of The Canberra Times from 1964 to 1965, and editor of The Sydney Morning Herald again from 1965 to 1970, this time with control over the whole paper, not just the leader page. He resigned after disagreements with the managing director, Sir Warwick Fairfax, and retired from full-time journalism.Pringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, pp. 171-76. In his memoirs of his life in newspapers he said of the role of the editor: > It is more important to be reasonable than to be right. ... In a democracy a > newspaper may be doing a useful service if it argues, fairly and logically, > a view which may subsequently prove to be wrong. ... An editor is not god; > he is part of the democratic process by which a nation argues and blunders > its way towards the truth.Pringle, Have Pen: Will Travel, pp. 184-85. After retiring he wrote several books, and continued to write articles for periodicals, including Quadrant. He also developed an interest in ornithology, and wrote three books on Australian birds. Personal life and death In December 1936 he married Celia Carroll. They had a son and two daughters. She died in 1997, and he died on 4 December 1999 in Sydney. The John Douglas Pringle Award, given to Australian journalists, is named after him.

Since that time, there have been a large number of Spanish loanwords introduced to the language, loans which span from nouns and verbs to adjectives and particles. Syntactical constructions have also been borrowed into Nahuatl from Spanish, through which the latter language has exerted typological pressure on the form such that Nahuatl and Spanish are exhibiting syntactic and typological convergence. Today, hardly any Nahuatl monolinguals remain, and the language has undergone extreme shift to Spanish, such that some consider it be on the way to extinction. The Nahuatl and Spanish languages have coexisted in stable contact for over 500 years in central Mexico. This long, well-documented period of contact provides some of the best linguistic evidence for contact-induced grammatical change. That is to say, Spanish seems to have exerted a profound influence on the Nahuatl language, but despite the extreme duration of their contact Nahuatl has only recently begun to show signs of language shift. This shift is progressing at a startling rate. Though Nahuatl still has over a million speakers, it is considered by some linguists to be endangered and on the way to extinction (Hill & Hill 1980, 321). As with regional languages the world over, Nahuatl finds itself being replaced by a ‚Äòworld‚Äô language, Spanish, as other small linguistic communities have shifted to languages like English and Chinese. The world's loss in linguistic diversity can be tied to its changing economic and political conditions, as the model of industrial capitalism under a culturally homogenizing nation state spread throughout the world and culture becomes more and more global rather than regional. However, we do not always know exactly why some local or ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô languages are clung to and preserved while others vanish much more quickly (Hill & Hill, 1980, 321).  Contact history  = Spanish conquest = Contact in earnest between the two languages began along with the beginning of the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1519. Prior to that, Nahuatl existed as the dominant language of much of central, southern, and western Mexico, the language of the dominant Aztec culture and Mexica ethnic group. Though the Spanish tried to eradicate much of Mexica culture after their defeat of the Mexica Aztec in their capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521, Aztec culture and the Nahuatl language were spread among a variety of ethnic groups in Mexico, some of whom, like the Tlaxcala, were instrumental allies of the Spanish in their defeat of the Aztec empire. Since a large part of the surviving indigenous population, whom the Spanish hoped to Christianize and assimilate, were part of the now fragmented Aztec culture and thus speakers of Nahuatl, the Spanish missionaries recognized that they would continue to need the help of their Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies, and allowed them some relative autonomy in exchange for their help in conquering and Christianizing the remainder of the territory, in parts of which indigenous populations remained hostile throughout the 16th century. In this way, friendly Nahuatl speaking communities were valuable in their role as intermediaries between the Spanish and other indigenous groups. = Growing marginalization and emerging shift = Though the Spanish issued many decrees throughout the centuries discouraging the uses of native tongues, such decrees were difficult to enforce, and often counter-productive to the goals of the missionary and military forces actually interacting with the indigenous populations (Schmal, 2004). That is early Spanish Franciscan missionaries believed mutual comprehension between converter and convertee to be essential to a successful Christianization. Many such missionaries learned Nahuatl and developed a system of writing for the language with the Latin alphabet, enabling them to transcribe many works of classical Nahuatl poetry and mythology, preserving the older, pre-contact varieties of the language. Thanks to the efforts of these early missionaries, we have documented sources of the Classical Nahuatl language dating back to the 1540s, which have enabled a systematic investigation of the changes it has undergone over the centuries under the influence of Spanish. Learning Nahuatl also enabled missionaries to teach the Christian gospel to American Indians using evangelical materials prepared in the indigenous language and using indigenous concepts, a technique which certain sects, particularly the Jesuits, believed was often met with better results (Hill & Hill, 1986). Thus, though Nahuatl usage was discouraged officially, its use was actually preserved and encouraged by the Spanish in religious, scholarly, and civil spheres into the late 18th century, until the Spanish monarchy began to take a more hard-line approach towards assimilating indigenous populations into the state. By the time of the 1895 census, there were still 659,865 Mexican citizens who reported themselves to be monolingual Nahuatl speakers, which group represented 32.1% of the total indigenous- speaking population, but over the next century the number of monolingual Nahuatl speakers would decline. By 1930 there were reportedly 355,295 monolingual speakers, and as of the 2000 census there remain only approximately 220,000 monolinguals among the 1.5 million Nahuatl speakers, the vast majority of whom being middle-aged or elderly (Schmal, 2004). At this point, Spanish was well-integrated into most Mexicano communities, and language shift was rapidly occurring among the younger generations.  Syntactic change  As there came to be greater and greater degrees of interaction between Indian and Hispanic communities and with it greater bilingualism and language contact, the Mexicano language changed typologically to converge with Spanish and ease the incorporation of Spanish material. Through the first few years of language contact, most Spanish influence of Nahuatl consisted in simple lexical borrowings of nouns related to the emergent material exchange between the two cultures. However, where the influence of Nahuatl on Mexican Spanish largely stopped at the level of basic lexical borrowings, Nahuatl continued on to borrow more grammatical words: verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, connective particles, and discourse markers. Incorporation of such borrowed materials into the native language made forced some grammatical alterations to accommodate structures that would not be possible within Classical Nahuatl (Flores Farf√°n, 2004). The net effect of such alterations was that ‚ÄúNahuatl by 1700 or 1720 had become capable in principle of absorbing any Spanish word or construction. The rest has been done by continued, ever growing cultural pressures, bringing in more words and phrases as the two bodies of speakers became more intertwined and bilingualism increased (Hill & Hill, 1986).‚Äù To be more specific, there has been convergence in word order, level of agglutination, and incorporation of Spanish grammatical particles and discourse markers in Nahuatl speech. For instance, whereas Nahuatl had an adjective-noun word order Mexicano follows Spanish in its noun-adjective word order (Flores Farf√°n, 2004). This may be due to the borrowing of phrases from Spanish incorporating the Spanish particle de, in phrases of the form NOUN + de + ADJ, e.g. aretes de oro meaning ‚Äògold earrings‚Äô (Hill & Hill, 1986, 239). Furthermore, the incorporation of de in Nahuatl may have also influenced a parallel shift from modifier-head to head-modifier in possessive constructions. That is, Classical Nahuatl had a possessor-possessum/noun-genitive order, but infiltration of the Spanish particle de may have also driven the shift to possessum- possessor/genitive-noun order. Whereas previously possessive noun clauses in the Nahuatl were markedly introduced by an inflected possessum plus and adjunctor in and a possessor, or unmarkedly simply by an possessor and inflected possessum (that is, the in particle was inserted in front of the displaced element of a marked word order), Nahuatl speakers have analyzed the loan de as functioning in a parallel fashion to native in, and used it to create unmarked possessum/possessor constructions in the manner of Spanish, without genitive inflections. So far this change has only spread to constructions with inanimate possessors, but it may extend further to compete with and displace Classical varieties and complete syntactic convergence (Hill & Hill, 1986, 243). Parallel incorporation of Spanish prepositions in the previously postpositional language, along with Mexican Spanish discourse markers like pero, este, bueno, and pues have resulted in a modern Mexicano language that can sound strikingly Spanish in terms of its sentence frames, rhythm, and vocabulary (Brody, 1995). Finally, some agglutinative tendencies of Nahuatl have faded in contemporary dialects. For instance, in Nahuatl there was a tendency to incorporate nouns into verbs as sorts of adverbial modifiers which is losing productivity (Hill & Hill, 1986, 259). One could tortilla-make for instance. Verbs generally were accompanied by a wide variety of objective, instrumental, tense, and aspect markers. One commonly would agglutinatively indicate directional purposivity, for instance, but such constructions are now more commonly made with a periphrastic Spanish calque of the form GO + (bare) INF (a la ir + INF). Such disincorporation of verbal modifiers into periphrastic expressions on analogy with Spanish forms indicates a shift towards a more analytic style characteristic of Hispanic speech.

In 1858, the college was established when Boston businessman Charles Tufts donated 20 acres of land to the church to establish the college. It is the second oldest college that was founded in the Boston area.. During the 19th century the college grew. The official college seal, bearing the motto Pax et Lux (Peace and Light) was adopted in 1857. The school colors of brown and blue were selected in 1876. Tufts' mascot became Jumbo when P.T. Barnum gave a natural history museum to the university. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the college grew and expanded to becoming a national university offering masters and PhD programs with the establishment of a medical school in 1899, an engineering school in 1898, a dental school in 1899, and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1933. In 1954, Tufts College became Tufts University. During the 1970s, French American nutritionist Jean Mayer became president and through a series of acquisitions, increased the endowment six-fold and expanded the university. During the 1990s and 2000s, Tufts continued to observe growth with the merger with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and the establishment of the Allen Discovery Centers. Foundation Tufts College, c. 1854 In the 1840s, the Universalist church wanted to open a college in New England due to the majority of members being barred from expensive colleges. In the spring of 1847, Rev. Thomas J. Sawyer of New York opened a correspondence with Rev. Hosea Ballou of Medford and Rev. Thomas Whittemore of Cambridgeport who was also the editor of Trumpet and Universalist Magazine. On April 17, 1847, Sawyer issued a circular in the \\"Trumpet\\" and called for an \\"educational convention\\" to meet on Orchard Street in New York City on May 18. The meeting was opened by Ballou and presented the arguments for a college for the Universalists. After it was agreed upon, the selection of a site was left to a board which was elected later in that meeting. The first board of trustees had five members. Ballou announced that $100,000 needed to be raised prior to the commencement of any operations. Seeing no other alternative, the board reconvened on September 14, and a business committee was established. Later on April 21, 1851 a committee on location was established and reported two favorable offers, a tract of 20 acres on a portion of the farm of Charles Tufts and a patch of land in 25 miles away in the town of Franklin. After several weeks, the trustees chose the Medford site, the site in Franklin would later be developed as a preparatory school for the new college. Early years (1852-1904) Charles Tufts, Tufts' namesake Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called Walnut Hill, and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said \\"I will put a light on it.\\" His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts' now 150 acre campus, straddling Somerville and Medford. His gift was accompanied by another 20 acres from Timothy Cotting. Additionally Sylvanus Packard also contributed to the college by bequeathing his entire of estate worth about $300,000 to the college upon his death in 1866. It was also in 1852 that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote \\"virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended.\\" Building operations commenced and on July 23, 1853 the corner- stone of the first college building was laid by Ballou. The building was designed to be rectangular, one hundred feet by sixty feet. With three finished storied built in an Italianate style with red brick and sandstone trimmings. Architect Gridley James Fox Bryant was hired for the design. In addition to recitation rooms, the building contained dormitories, bathing accommodations, a chapel, library, and two common rooms. During construction, Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh. On August 18, 1855, the last examination for admission was held and the opening of the college was announced on the August 22. In February 1855, an association was formed whose main job was to raise funds for the college. It consisted of parishes, auxiliary, and religious societies, and was known as the \\"Tufts College Educational Association.\\" The first matriculation exercise occurred from 9:00-11:00 in the morning on August 16, 1855. Opening prayers and four toasts were made with the total amount subscribed at the dinner to be $4,000. Under President Ballou, 21 students entered the Freshman class including four who had been studying there the previous years. Additionally, there were three Sophomores, three juniors, for a total of 30 students. The Class of 1856 had 15 students but by 1859 it had risen to 50. The first commencement exercises occurred on July 8, 1857 with three students receiving their degrees. The requirements for admission were the same as Harvard but most of the young men came from the country and had poor preparation, thus they were admitted under heavy conditions. During the six years of Ballou's tenure 108 students were registered. After Ballou died in 1861, he was succeeded by Alonzo Ames Miner. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. The first major donation to the college came from the parish at $16,000. Later on Dr. William Walker donated $200,000. In 1863 a gift of $50,000 was provided by the State for the creation of three scholarships each $50. When the tuition was raised from the original $35 to $50 the scholarships were increased to $100. Several other scholarships were during the 1860s. The establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include Goddard Seminary, Westbrook Seminary, and Dean Academy also occurred. During the Civil War the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the Underground Railroad. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. Miner's successor, Elmer Capen of the Class of 1860 was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators, Amos Dolbear became chair of the physics department in 1875. He installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later Alexander Graham Bell would receive the patent. Dolbear's work at Tufts was later continued by Marconi and Tesla. Other famous scholars included William Leslie Hooper who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, Frederick Stark Pearson would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure was Stephen M. Babcock who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars Arthur Michael, who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and John Sterling Kingsley who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.Tufts College. (1952) Tufts College: A Centennial History. Medford, Massachusetts.Russell, Miller E. (1966) Light on the Hill: A History of Tufts College (1852-1952). =Curriculum= The first curriculum offered one course which led to a Bachelor of Arts degree with most of the work being prescribed. Half of the work was required to be in Greek and Latin. Instruction in Mathematics was required for two years, History for three, and Rhetoric for four. Work in modern languages was considered an elective and with work in Moral Science, Physical Science, Natural and Revealed Religion finishing the prescribed studies. Few changes were made to the curriculum during Ballou's tenure. Changes included reducing the Mathematics requirements and the expansion of modern language instruction. The curriculum was expanded with the creation of the Philosophical Course aimed at helping students in the Classics. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. Thomas Willis Pratt who would later develop the Pratt Truss was the primary instructor. He was assisted by Dr. Charles Bray. In 1869, the Crane Theological School was organized. Under Capen's direction, larger opportunities for elective work began. The required work in Latin, Greek and Mathematics was confined to a year and a half. In 1875, the Philosophical course was extended to cover the four years. The Faculty of Letters doubled eventually from 11 to 26 instructors by 1895. In 1890, elementary French and German was made a requisite for admission and in 1891 a Modern Language course was established. Modern Languages were eventually required for advanced work in the Philosophical Course. On July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted to create Jackson College so \\"that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men.\\" The trustees also voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the Ph.D. degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the university. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892 - 1893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering. =Development and expansion= After the completion of College Hall, in 1856, a brick building, known as Building A, was constructed for $9,715. Arranged for a boarding-house and dormitory, it accommodated 26 students. In 1857 a two story wooden dormitory accommodating 12 students was built on the site of what is now West Hall and in 1860 a large 4 story dormitory, now known as East Hall was erected. Tufts College Avenue Station in 1907 During the first decade, the college had been isolated but in 1861, what is now College Avenue, was laid out to connect the campus with Somerville and Medford. In 1866, Professors Row and Packard Avenue were laid out. A large reservoir was also constructed that year, adjacent to the main campus. The reservoir itself part of the Boston water supply system, provided drinking water to the communities of Somerville, Charlestown, and Chelsea. West Hall, a dormitory designed to accompany East Hall was planned in 1869, with construction completed in 1872. The end of Miner's tenure was also marked by the growth of the library which by then contained 4,000 volumes. During Capen's tenure the library could no longer be accommodated in College Hall, so a stack was accommodated in a small building between East and West Halls known as Middle Hall. On March 29, 1892, Goddard Chapel was dedicated. It was given by Mrs. Mary T. Goddard in memory of her husband Thomas A. Goddard, who established one of the first scholarship programs. The architect was J. Philip Rinn. Goddard also gave a gymnasium, completed on what is now Ginn Library. Surviving fragments of Jumbo from the conflagration P. T. Barnum, one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, gave $55,000 in 1882 for the creation of the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall). Completed in 1884 with an additional donation of $40,000, the building housed his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of Jumbo the elephant, who would become the university's mascot. The museum also incorporated an earlier collection of rocks and minerals which was established in the first decade of the college's existence. The museum stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection. Several new dormitories opened during the late 19th century. Dean Hall was erected next to the gymnasium in 1886. Miner and Paige Halls were built to house students in the Theological School. Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women after Jackson College was founded. The Commons Building, now known as Curtis Hall was built in 1893 and incorporated the first dining hall for the college. Bromfield-Pearson was erected in 1894 to provide a course for preparatory engineering instruction. In 1898 Robinson Hall was constructed to house newly created College of Engineering. The Boston and Lowell Railroad opened its namesake line in 1835, though local stops were not added immediately. By 1889, the College Hill station was located on the north side of the tracks just west of College Avenue. By 1900, College Hill was replaced with Tufts College station, located on the opposite side of the tracks and slightly to the south at Pearson Street. Moving Jumbo into the Barnum Museum in 1889 =Student activities= The first society formed among the students was the Mathetican, a literary group. The organization, occupied the northeast corner of College Hall. The program of its meetings consisted of debates, essays and orations and for several years it was an important part of life in the college. In 1860 members who were dissatisfied with the affairs of the Mathetican began a rival society known as the Walnut Hill Fraternity. The northwest corner of College Hall was given to them. Later a Theological Society was established and its membership was made up of students who wanted to join the ministry. In 1855, the Kappa Chapter of both Zeta Psi and Theta Delta Chi entered the college. After the establishment of the Theological School, the Mathetican saw another rival, the Zetagathean. In 1864 the Order of the Round Table was established as a rival to an earlier society known as the Order of the Coffee Pot. These two were short lived however and both died out by 1868. An economic organization was founded in 1872, known as the Tufts Laundry Association. A Glee Club was founded in 1866 but died out in 1874. In 1873 several smaller organizations were created such as the Chess Club, the Amateur Dispatch Company, and the Reading-room Association. In 1864, the first college publications were issued. The Tuftonian became the first. Originally a pamphlet of four pages, it was enlarged to 32 pages by 1872. In 1874 the Tufts College Publishing Association was established. Its first publication ran under the name the \\"Collegian.\\" =Athletics= Baseball was introduced in 1863, followed by football ten years later. Two boat clubs were established and in the Spring of 1865, the Theta Delta Chi fraternity provided members with a boathouse on the Mystic River. The Tufts Athletic Association was founded in November 1874, with the first competitions held on November 4. The first events were a mile walk, a mile run, a 100-yard dash, a wheelbarrow race, sack race, and a three-legged race. These were held on the reservoir with later activities being held on the grounds of what is now Fletcher Field. Continued expansion (1904‚Äì1945) Ballou Hall 1905 In 1905, President Capen died. A committee of 7 Trustees appointed the Chairman of the Executive Committee Frederick W. Hamilton as acting president. Under Capen, the library collection which had been distributed between College (Ballou) Hall and Middle (Packard) Hall was given its own building. A gift from Andrew Carnegie, gave Tufts a new library at a cost of $100,000. The building was designed by the New York firm of Whitfield & King and is one of the firms best known works. The edifice was centrally located on top of the hill, with red brick walls, stone steps and elaborate marble columns and ornamentation in the neo- classical style. The stack area was designed for 200,000 books however shelving was not completed until 1938. The cost of equipping the library cost over $11,000. Mrs. Carnegie decided that rather than having the library share Carnegie name, the building would be a memorial to Rev. Charles H. Eaton who had presided over her wedding. The Jackson College for Women was fully established in 1910 as a coordinate college adjacent to the Tufts campus. In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the \\"College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College.\\" Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002. =Great Depression= After Bumpus, came President Cousens who observed expansion of the university during the Great Depression. The effects were not as great as some feared. Despite the fact that lower than expected enrollment occurred, the entering classes during the 1930s were the largest in the history of the college. The noticeable difference was the higher portion of students who lived at home rather than on the Hill. While it meant loss of revenue, it also meant enrolling more students. In 1933, seven regional prize scholarships were established to encourage qualified students to enter. Six additional competitive scholarships cover tuition were created by the Trustees in 1935 and became known as \\"New England Scholarships\\". Fundraising became the primary project during the decade. A project which had started when Cousens was elected in 1919. Cousens set the ideal target of $2 million for the endowment, but the goal had to be lowered to $1 million due to limited income from donors. Cousens proposed to organize the college into three sections. The first section would lead students to earning an Associate in Arts degree. After completing the AA degree, students would go to the second section to earn a Bachelor's degree. The third section would provide students with at most two years in professional training. He suggested that in addition to the medical, dental, engineering, and religious schools, that schools in law, business, and education would be established. Cousens set up a master plan with the firm of Andrews, Jones, Biscoe, and Whitmore. He first set out to enclose as well as beautify the campus. Two main gates would be set up. The Gager Gate dedicated in 1921 was placed in front of Campus Drive across from the reservoir. The gate was donated by Harold Gager. In 1963, the gate was removed due to extensive construction and because its narrow aperture no longer sufficed for conveyances which had to enter the campus. In 1924, Eugene Bowen provided another gate for the western part of campus. After the Bowen Gate, sections were contributed by the Class of 1899 and numerous other classes beginning with the Class of 1924. In 1926, the Trustees voted to construct ten sections of the campus fence to represent the Classes of 1857 through 1866. The eastern sections of the campus gates were completed in 1926, with the Starkweather Gate, the Hodgdon Gate, and the Memorial Gate accompanied with a large staircase that led to the upper campus from College Avenue. Cousens would commission the Olmsted Brothers to design the staircase and the landscaping of the Hill, referring to the campus as a garden. In 1932, the firm of Andrews, Jones, Biscoe, and Whitmore prepared for a long-range plan for the Hill. They suggested that the headquarters of the new Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy be built across from Ballou Hall. This building would have a new portico on the north side to match Ballou's portico. At the foot of the hill, the firm suggested a monumental building across from the Memorial Steps. It was to include an assembly hall, theater, and student union. In order to encourage students to stay on campus, the plan also included new housing on what is today Fletcher Field. From the master plan only four buildings came into existence, Gifford House, Braker Hall, Blakeley Hall, and Stratton Hall. =Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy= In 1911, Dr. Austin Barclay Fletcher became the chair of the board of Trustees. A millionaire, his death in the summer of 1923 created one of the most complex legal tangles in which the College became involved. Fletcher's will left an estimated $3,000,000 for the university with $1,000,000 going to establish a new school of law and diplomacy and the rest for new buildings and their maintenance. Under Cousens, the estimates of the amount anticipated fluctuated until by the end of 1924, a settlement was made by Fletcher's relatives. The final installment arrived in 1925 and by 1926 planning started on the creation of the new school. Professor George Grafton Wilson from Harvard Law School was appointed the first lecturer of the school. Tufts expanded in the 1933 with the opening of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and Harvard University, funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Dr. Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain. =Braker School of Business Administration= Austin Fletcher had among his clients, Henry J. Braker, a New York real estate owner and manufacturer. He convinced Braker to visit the hill in 1905 and invest in the development of a school devoted to the fields of economics, finance, and business administration. Braker's will provided $500,000 to the college, the sum of which was known as the Henry J. Braker Fund. President Hamilton informed the Trustees that Tufts' own Braker School of Business Administration would be opened by 1910. Eventually the dean of Harvard Business School offered to help organize the school. Tufts however did not receive the funds until 1913, which also only amounted to $350,000. Bumpus who succeeded Hamilton still considered the idea with Fletcher beginning to organize the administration for the new school. Locations for the new school were also debated with from the MIT campus to across the street from the Museum of Fine Arts. In the spring of 1920 the Board of Trustees voted to establish the Braker School of Business Administration with students to be admitted in September of 1920. A few weeks later the name was changed to the Braker School of Commerce. Several curricula were created which was intended to overlap with the undergraduate requirements. In his mind, Fletcher intended Braker to rival the Wharton School of Finance and at one time considered opening Braker to high school graduate. Cousen's ideas about the nature and proposed school changed over the years. His original idea was to offer a combined course of 6 years in both a liberal arts and professional degree. Additional confusion occurred with how the new school would fit in with Cousen's three part plan for the curriculum. Cousens and Fletcher went back and forth for four years and in the end no step was taken to implement the Trustee vote. In 1925 the Board of Trustees used Braker's estate to establish graduate teaching fellowships to broaden course offerings in the department of economics. These also assisted in the construction of Braker Hall in 1927. The Braker Fund continued to support the economics department until the 1960s. =Wartime= During World War II, Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Due to travel restrictions imposed by World War II, the Boston Red Sox conducted spring training for the 1943 Major League season at Tufts College. Postwar expansion (1945-1999) Tufts memorial steps, as seen in April 1976 In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school's name to Tufts University. Tufts University station with a Budd RDC in September 1977 Along with the other local stops in Somerville and Medford, Tufts College station was abandoned by 1950 due to competition from streetcars and buses. In November 1976, the MBTA opened a Tufts University station near the Tufts College station site. It was abandoned in October 1979 due to poor ridership. The College of Engineering added graduate study to its curriculum beginning in 1961, with master's degrees available in four departments. It added Ph.D. programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984 CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corp Bernard Marshall Gordon founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the New England Association of Schools and Colleges accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. As part of the same reorganization the Faculty of Arts and Science became the Faculty of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (AS&E;). In 1965, the library collection outgrew Eaton Hall and the collection and was moved to a new building named Wessell Library. The demand for more square footage prompted the expansion of Wessell. In 1995, with the addition of 80,000 more square feet, the library was renamed Tisch Library.

The band describes itself as a \\"mainstream\\" rock band and has been described as a \\"legendary bar band\\" and \\"legendary Shore party band.\\" Although the members' musical influences vary, most credit the Beatles as an important musical influence. Frank Sementa (drums), was influenced by watching Arthur Godfrey's TV show and listening to his parents' Glenn Miller and McGuire Sisters records. Keyboardist Danny Gralick, from Belmar and Philadelphia, who had played for Jim Croce for a time, was inspired by Buddy Greco. Guitarist Joel Krauss, who was from Brooklyn, originally played the French Horn, but switched to guitar because it was more popular with his peers. Krauss was a cab driver when he saw the ad for a guitarist. Krauss later quit the band for a while, but rejoined the band later.Bobby Bandiera playing with Holme in 1978, wearing T-shirt with band's logo. Bobby Bandiera, who is also from Orange, NJ, and was already playing guitar nearly every night at the Jersey Shore, dropped out of school (but earned his GED) to join Holme when he was only 16 years old. He was soon was making more money than his parents combined. Bandiera later joined Cats on a Smooth Surface, the Stone Pony's popular house band, which was founded by former Holme members Joel Krauss (father of Alexis Krauss, front women for Sleigh Bells) and Harry Filkin. Cats' other members included Glen Burtnick (who later joined Styx), Fran Smith (later in The Hooters), and Ray Andersen (who joined Meat Loaf). In addition, Springsteen sometimes jammed with Cats. Bandiera went on to play with Southside Johnny and Bon Jovi. In its heyday, Holme would often play six nights a week at the Jersey Shore and in North Jersey. Venues played included major popular clubs such as D'Jais, Art Stock's Royal Manor (North and South), Jimmy Byrne's Sea Girt Inn, The Headliner, and the Stone Pony at the shore, and Mother's, Dodd's, the Soap Factory, and the Towpath up north. Back in the 1970s, playing the suburban rock club circuit was steady work and lucrative. Primarily popular as a cover band, the band produced several singles, including the \\"Garden State Parkway Boogie\\" by band member Mark Mazur. The song was inspired by the fact that although they lived in Manasquan, the band often played in North Jersey. Similarly, most of their following, who lived in North Jersey, would drive to the shore to see them in the summer. They realized that they or their following was driving on the Parkway almost every night, and decided to write a song about it.\\" The song is still a favorite among followers. They also designed their logo to look like the Parkway signs after checking to see if the New Jersey Highway Authority had any objections. Mark Mazur playing with Holme in 1977. For a while the band spent time visiting radio stations to promote their singles, recording demonstration tapes, and talking to record companies. In the early days, Danny Gralick, Mark Mazur, and Bobby Bandiera composed some songs individually and together. Mazur's brother Bret Mazur (not to be confused with Bret Epic Mazur) is also a songwriter and co-wrote the Brecker Brothers song \\"East River.\\" Mazur eventually left to start his own band, Mark Mazur and the Targets, that included Mark Mesaros on bass, Dennis Diken on drums, and Dave Cogswell on keyboards. Mesaros and Diken later joined Pat DiNizio to form The Smithereens. Holme had hoped to someday enjoy the success achieved by artists like Fleetwood Mac and Steve Miller. Conner told a reporter, \\"Artists like that pretty much call their own shots. When their contracts run their course, they can negotiate their new ones. The idea is to make six albums and in five years be in the same commanding position recording-wise that we have in the nightclubs right now.\\" In the meantime, they formed a publishing company, \\"Shore Shot\\", and a record label, \\"Thin Ice.\\" Although the elusive big contract did not materialize, Holme was immensely popular in New Jersey in the 1970s and 1980s. As of 2016, Holme was playing Monday nights at D'Jais (which Sementa and Conner, along with Holme's former manager, Bill Luddecke, have owned since 1979) in the summer, as well as at other events off season.

The battle was the final major action for the Katipunan chapter of \\"Maluningning\\" ending in the defeat of the rebels and martial law in Laguna province. Background After centuries of Spanish colonial rule, resentment towards the colonists, particularly the Dominican friars who owned much of the farmland in Laguna province, grew and grew with colonial and clerical powers abusing their powers and punishing the tenants of the farmlands if they refused to pay their dues. A good example of this is the eviction of the Rizal clan from Calamba town after their struggles with their Dominican tenants. Jos√© Rizal, national hero of the Philippines wrote about such issues in his 2 great novels, Noli me tangere, and El filibusterismo. The latter called for a revolution urgently. the call of revolt was answered by the Katipunan secret society. Established by Andres Bonifacio in Manila, within a few years, Katipunero chapters were opened in the surrounding provinces with the Katipunan chapter \\"Maluningning\\" established in Pagsanjan on December 12, 1894, by Severino Tai√±o. Members came over from Lumban, Paete, Pakil, Siniloan, Cavinti, Santa Cruz, Magdalena and other towns even from Tayabas province. Jose Rizal, Philippine national hero was a native of Laguna province =The Revolution= In August 1896, the Katipunan was discovered by Spanish authorities, hostilities soon flared and simultaneous uprisings occurred in Cavite, Manila, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Batangas, Nueva Ecija, and Laguna. Such that these 8 provinces were placed under martial law by Governor Ramon Blanco. The Katipuneros of Laguna were forced to meet up and plan their revolution in even more secluded areas. One famous site of Katipunan meetings is the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery. Start of the revolt Laguna's revolutionaries initiated actual hostilities late in the year, choosing Severino Taino as their commander, they began their revolt by assaulting their respective towns in the hopes of getting arms from the local garrisons of Guardia Civil as well as to recruit rebels from the native garrisons under the Spanish army. The attacks on the Laguna towns of Lumban, Paete, Pakil, Siniloan, Cavinti, Santa Cruz, Magdalena and Pagsanjan were tactically successful in gaining arms and recruiting the cuadrilleros or local native police of each town. However, no strategic points were captured and the army of Laguna remained a guerrilla force. By the time General Taino organized his volunteers he had with him, over 3,000 men from all over Laghuna and Tayabas provinces, the arms they had taken from the Spaniards proved hopelessly insufficient, however, it was now or never for the revolutionaries who intended an attack on the major town of Sta. Cruz. =Attack on Sta. Cruz= The attack on Sta. Cruz was initiated on November 15, 1896 with general Taino attacking the Casa Real and the Church and convent of Sta. Cruz, the detachment of cazadores and infanterias had been reinforced by the arrival of General Nicolas Jaramillo, put in command of the zone of Laguna by Gov. Blanco. The 3,000 Katipuneros armed with very few guns, with mostly spears and Bolo knives faced a numerically reinforced and technologically superior Spanish force armed with Remington and Mauser rifles, as well as some Artillery. Unsurprisingly, the attack failed with the Katipuneros taking heavy casualties. =Defending Pagsanjan= Severino Taino and his army retreated to the crossroads near the Barrio of Sambat in Pagsanjan. This was his de facto capital and base, realizing the Spaniards' intention to strike his positions here, he took to defending the crossroads of Sambat with the remainder of his army, with his rear guard of cuadrilleros under Colonel Francisco Abad. The following day, November 16, saw the Spanish cazadores clash with the rebels. the beleaguered and morale-depleted rebels were rallied one last time by Colonel Abad and as the charged at the cazadores, Abad was shot and killed, falling from his horse. After 3 hours of fierce hand-to-hand combat, the rebels were reduced and General Taino no longer had enough men to fight the Spaniards in battle, he shifted to guerrilla warfare with the remainder of his once massive rebel army. The Spaniards began their persecution and arrest of suspected rebels throughout the province the following weeks. Site of the battle of Sambat Aftermath The revolt ended the chances of the Katipuneros initiating further hostilities against the Spaniards, reducing their war to one of attrition and hit-and-run attacks. This was the case for most of the revolution at this point in time, save for the revolution in Cavite which saw the entire province liberated. Cavite was seen by many Tagalogs as a refuge from the suffocating martial law of their home provinces. The persecuted Lagunenos civilian and partisan, began travelling in droves, in a massive exodus towards independent Cavite, bringing with them their town bands, patron saints and banners. The relative quiet of hostilities helped these people travel easier towards Cavite in what was to be called \\"Ang Panahon ng Tagalog\\" or the Tagalog Age. However, with the Spaniards executing Jose Rizal in Manila on December 30, 1896, the revolt soon flared up once more. thumb References External links * Official Website of Laguna * Official Website of Laguna * Flickr * Laguna Travel Guide * Google Books Category:battles of the Philippine Revolution Category:history of Laguna (province) ","title":"Battle of Sambat"},{"id":"50553682","text":"The Echoes of Carnaby Street were an American garage rock band from Miami, Florida who were active in the 1960s. They became a popular live act in the Miami area and enjoyed a minor regional hit with \\"No Place Or Time\\", released on Thames Records. In the intervening years their work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts, particularly with the inclusion of \\"No Place No Time\\" on the 1986 Louisiana Punk Groups From The 60's Vol. 1 compilation, which paradoxically resulted in helping contribute to the misconception that they were a Louisiana band. The Echoes of Carnaby Street began as the Tidal Waves in Miami Florida in 1965 and were founded by students from Nautilus Junior High. The group's lineup eventually settled down to Mark Resnick and Russell Frehling on guitars, Jeff Laibson on keyboards, Sammy Weiselberg on bass, and Eddie Marcus on drums. Guitarist Resnick‚Äôs father was the managing director of the Monte Carlo and Shelborne hotels, which guaranteed the group regular and steady booking. The band nonetheless became respected for their performing abilities and eventually became fixtures all around the Florida Bandstand circuit. They quickly matriculated beyond just appearing at smaller venues such the Surfside Community Center and the 163rd Street Mall, eventually landed dates at the Dinner Key Auditorium. Reflecting the influence of the British Invasion they eventually changed their name to Echoes of Carnaby Street, after the popular street that in the 1960s was the mecca of mod fashion in London. Steve Palmer of the Florida Bandstand heard them and was impressed enough to arrange for the group to record at Criteria Studios for his Thames label, under the guidance of producer and former Canadian Legends drummer, and Jim Sessody. The group laid down two tracks, \\"No Place or Time\\" and \\"Baby Doesn't Know\\", both of which were written or co- written by Travis Fairchild of another Miami band the Clefs of Lavender Hill, who had scored a hit that year (initially on Thames Records) with \\"Stop! Get A Ticket\\". \\"No Place or Time had a melody but no lyrics, so Mark Resnick contributed words to the song, which was chosen to be the A-side of the group's single, which was released in August of 1966. \\"No Place Or Time\\" was immediately picked up by WFUN Radio, and made #52 on the \\"Boss 79\\" survey in September 1966. Despite their favorable prospects, the group did not hold together and broke up shortly thereafter. Mark Resnick later emerged in the Miami-to-New York glam band Wowii, who gained a cult following, and their successor, Broken Heroes. Keyboardist Jeff Laibson went on to pursue a career as a multimedia artist, mixing music and visual art. Russell Frehling went on to achieved success in avant-garde music. In the intervening years the Echoes of Carnaby's work has attracted the attention of garage rock enthusiasts and collectors. \\"No Place No Time\\" was included on the 1986 Louisiana Punk Groups From The 60's Vol. 1 compilation, put out by Eva Records, then again later on CD on Eva's 1991 Sixties Archives Vol. 3 Louisiana Punk. While bringing the band's work to a wider audience, Eva Records, by including the group on Louisiana compilations, inadvertently contributed to the misconception that the Echoes of Carnaby were a Louisiana band, a point which former band members have dispelled.

Early in its history, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) had a series of negative encounters with the United States federal government. This led to decades of mistrust, armed conflict, and the eventual disincorporation of the church by an act of the United States Congress. The relationship between the church and the government eventually improved and in recent times LDS Church members have served in leadership positions in Congress and held other important political offices. The LDS Church becomes involved in political matters if it perceives that there is a moral issue at stake and wields considerable influence on a national level with over a dozen members of Congress having membership in the church in the early 2000s, and about 80% of Utah state lawmakers identifying as Latter-day Saints. 19th century Many of the political problems faced by the LDS Church stemmed from the controversial practice of polygamy. The practice started with Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, secretly taking on additional wives and was practiced publicly after his death. =Joseph Smith= Early LDS scriptures speak favorably of the United States government. The Book of Mormon (published 1830) contains a passage that favorably describes the American Revolution. An 1833 revelation from Joseph Smith gives divine credit to the establishment of the United States Constitution. In 1839, Joseph Smith visited U.S. President Martin Van Buren to plead for the U.S. to help roughly 20,000 Latter-Day Saint settlers of Independence, Missouri. The Governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs, in attempt to resolve the 1838 Mormon War, had issued an executive order on October 27, 1838, known as the \\"Extermination Order\\". It authorized troops to use force against Latter-Day Saints to \\"exterminate or drive [them] from the state\\".Boggs, Extermination Order Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Latter-Day Saints. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, \\"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri\\". After failing to receive the assistance of the President, Smith took his case to the Senate Judiciary Committee chaired by Senator Garret Wall. The Judiciary Committee did nothing to help the Latter-Day Saints, lacking the political willpower to launch an investigation into the Mormon War. The negative experience with Van Buren marked the beginning of decades of antagonism between the leaders of the Church and government officials. The White Horse Prophecy that followed, where Joseph Smith predicted that the United States Constitution would \\"hang like a thread\\", contrasts with the pro- government rhetoric from the early 1830s and reflects Smith's changing attitude towards the U.S. government. After his experience with Van Buren and finding no support from any of the other presidential candidates, Smith decided to run as an independent in the 1844 U.S. presidential election. He proposed the redemption of slaves by selling public lands and decreasing the size and salary of Congress; the ceasing of imprisonment of criminals (except in cases of murder); the reformation of criminals via education and public work; the annexation of Texas, Oregon, and parts of Canada; the securing of international rights on high seas; free trade; the re-establishment of a national bank; and the reduction of the public debt.. His top aide, Brigham Young, campaigned for Smith saying, \\"He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution.\\", quote on p 203 The campaign ended when Smith was attacked and killed by a mob while in the Carthage, Illinois, jail on June 27, 1844.Carthage Jail When the Latter- Day Saint population was concentrated in Nauvoo, Illinois, an Anti-Mormon party sprung up to oppose the Church's political influence in the state. =Utah Territory and statehood= After Smith's death, the majority of Latter-day Saints followed Young, who made plans to move everyone to the Salt Lake Valley. Young petitioned President Polk for federal assistance for their westward migration.Robert Leonard Little (2007). The War Letter: Jesse Carter Little and the Creation of the Mormon Battalion (Sacramento, Calif.: Robert Little Publishing) . Assistance came in the form of the enlistment of around 500 Mormons in the U.S. Army during the war with Mexico. The men's salaries were used to help pay for the migration of the larger body of the Saints. in 1849 the Latter-day Saints petitioned Congress that a huge swath of land which they had settled be admitted into the Union as the State of Deseret. The Mormons hoped for statehood so that they would have the ability to elect their own leaders, and hopefully avoid the persecution which they had so recently escaped. Because of their previous experiences, the Latter-day Saints were convinced that self-governance was the only safeguard to their religious freedom, and they worried about the possible introduction of \\"unsympathetic carpetbag appointees\\" if Deseret were relegated to territorial status.Peter Crawley, The Constitution of the State of Deseret, 29 (4) BYU Studies 7 (1989). Concern over the practice of polygamy as well as other issues made statehood politically unviable. However, Congress instead incorporated \\"Deseret\\" into the greatly reduced but still enormous Utah Territory as part of the Compromise of 1850. The compromise struck a delicate balance on the issue of slavery. The Mormons had introduced slavery to the area upon their arrival. John M. Bernhisel, a Mormon representative in Washington, D.C., strenuously lobbied President Fillmore for an all-Mormon slate of territorial officials. He urged the president that \\"the people of Utah cannot but consider it their right, as American citizens to be governed by men of their own choice, entitled to their confidence, and united with them in opinion and feeling.\\"LDS Church, Church History in the Fullness of Times Student Manual, 354. The president therefore appointed Brigham Young, as the territory's governor, and assigned prominent positions to several other Mormons. But, Fillmore also gave a number of territorial appointments to non-Mormons. The relationship between the non-Mormon federal officials and the Mormons was frequently contentious. Not long after their appointment, the federal officials, fearing for their safety, abandoned their positions, which were left unfilled for several years. During the 1856 U.S. presidential election, a key plank of the newly formed Republican Party's platform was a pledge \\"to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism: polygamy and slavery.\\"GOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia, Independence Hall Association Website Although polygamy was a focus of the Republican party platform, it would take more than three decades would pass before the LDS Church was stopped from performing new polygamous marriages. President James Buchanan sent U.S. forces to Utah in 1857‚Äì58 in order to appoint a new governor over the territory and take control away from church president Brigham Young. These events were known as the Utah War. The tragic Mountain Meadows Massacre occurred in the context of these events. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was relieved to receive a telegraphed reassurance from Brigham Young that the Utah territory had no intent to secede from the United States. Lincoln's policy for dealing with the Mormons was to leave them alone. He told a Mormon messenger, \\"You go back and tell Brigham Young that if he will let me alone I will let him alone.\\" In 1862, congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act with the purpose of outlawing polygamy in Mormon territories. However, as part of his decision to leave the Mormons alone, Lincoln choose not to enforce the law. The passage of the Poland Act in 1874 paved the way for the first prosecutions under the Morrill act from 12 years earlier. Believing the law to be in violation of the first amendment right to the free exercise of religion, Young asked George Reynolds, secretary to the First Presidency, to serve as a defendant for a test case before the Supreme Court. The unanimous decision from the court was to uphold the anti-polygamy laws and Reynolds sentence of two years in prison. In 1882, Congress passed the Edmunds Act, which made polygamy a felony. A key aspect of the Edmunds Act was that it was no longer necessary to prove a bigamous marriage took place to get a conviction, cohabitation was enough. More than 1,300 Mormon men were imprisoned under the terms of the act.U.S.History.com, Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882. Church president John Taylor was forced to go into hiding for several years frequently moving to avoid capture from the federal authorities. In 1887, Congress enacted the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act. The act disincorporated the church and seized its assets.L. Rex Sears, \\"Punishing the Saints for Their \\"Peculiar Institution\\": Congress on the Constitutional Dilemmas,\\" 2001 Utah L. Rev. 581 The act was also responsible for disenfranchising women, which had been given the right to vote in Utah before any of the 37 states at that time.Women's Suffrage in Utah Jean Bickmore White, Utah History Encyclopedia Women voters in the state were disproportionately Mormon, so giving women the right to vote and rescinding that right was a way to control Mormon influence on elections. The anti-polygamy laws were challenged in court but two Supreme Court rulings (Davis v. Beason and The Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States) upheld the right of the government to prohibit polygamous marriages and to seize the property of the LDS Church. A few months after losing its case before the Supreme Court, church president Wilford Woodruff stated that the church had ended the contracting of new polygamous marriages, reversing the long-standing practice of evading or ignoring anti-polygamy laws. Woodruff said that this announcement was the result of a revelation from Jesus Christ. The text of the revelation is known as the 1890 Manifesto. Campaigning against polygamy had been a focus of the Liberal Party. With that issue resolved and with the entrance of the major national parties into the state, the Liberal Party disbanded in 1893. Another effect of the 1890 Manifesto was to weaken any enthusiasm in congress for the passage of more anti-polygamy legislation. This opened up the door for the Utah Territory to be recognized as a state. In the 1870s, the People's Party was created in Utah Territory and backed by the LDS Church. The anti-Mormon Liberal Party existed at the same time but won few elections. The Salt Lake Tribune was the newspaper of the Liberal Party while the Deseret News supported the pro-Mormon People's Party. Church leaders realized that one obstacle to achieving statehood was that its population did not participate in either of the two major national political parties. It was decided that the People's Party should be disbanded. The Republican Party had opposed statehood for Utah. Because of this, the majority of Mormons in Utah leaned Democrat. However, church leaders did not want to see the entire body of the church turn Democrat leading to a continuation of the status-quo where there was one political party supported by the church and another party opposed to it. George Q. Cannon was sent by the First Presidency of the Church to instruct party leaders to make sure that Church members were split between the Republicans and Democrats. In some instances, local bishops stood in front of their congregations and instructed everyone seated on one side of the building to join one party and those families on the other side should join the other party. In 1895, Woodruff instituted a rule, informally known as the Mormon Political Manifesto, that general authorities of the church should not seek political office without prior permission of the First Presidency. In 1898, B. H. Roberts became the first church member to be elected to Congress. Due to Roberts being a polygamist, he was refused a seat in the Congress.. A special election was held to fill his seat, and William H. King, the congressman who had preceded him, won the election. Roberts later testified during the Smoot Hearings, when opponents of the LDS Church demanded that Republican Reed Smoot, a monogamist, be refused his senate seat because Smoot was a Mormon apostle. 20th century In 1903, the Utah State Legislature elected Reed Smoot to the U.S. Senate. Smoot was an apostle in the LDS Church. His election was controversial due to fears over his allegiance to the church. A hearing was held to determine if Smoot should be allowed a seat in the Senate; the hearing lasted four years, called 100 witnesses and generated 3,500 pages of testimony. Ultimately, Smoot was permitted to take his seat in the Senate. Church president Joseph F. Smith was one of the people subpoenaed to testify in the Smoot hearings. In 1906, Smith was brought to trial on a charge of unlawful cohabitation with four women in addition to his lawful wife; he pleaded guilty and was fined $300, the maximum penalty then permitted under the law.Deseret Evening News, November 23, 1906; Salt Lake Tribune, November 24, 1906. Smith was a supporter of the Republican party. In 1904, the American Party was formed in Utah in an attempt to revive the anti-Mormon Liberal Party.Dean L. May (1987). Utah: A People's History (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, ) p. 162. The party lasted until 1911. During the administration of Heber J. Grant, an effort was made to remove from church literature, sermons, and ceremonies any suggestion that Latter-day Saints should seek vengeance on the citizens or government of the United States for past persecutions of the church and its members, and in particular for the assassinations of church founder Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. This policy became known as the Good Neighbor policy. Grant, a Democrat, was opposed to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) and caused a front-page editorial to be written to that effect in the church-owned Deseret News. Grant shared the view of J. Reuben Clark and David O. McKay that the New Deal was socialism, something they all despised. FDR had campaigned on a platform that included the repeal of alcohol prohibition; meanwhile, Grant was a leader in the Utah state Prohibition movement. Despite this, FDR won Utah in each of his four elections. Grant, seeing the majority of the church members supporting FDR, regarded this as \\"one of the most serious conditions that has confronted me since I became President of the Church.\\" Later, when Utah voters agreed by plebiscite to become the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, thus completing the process of ratification and repealing Prohibition, Grant was devastated; in a general conference, he told the Latter-day Saints, \\"I have never felt so humiliated in my life over anything as that the State of Utah voted for the repeal of Prohibition.\\"Heber J. Grant, Conference Report, October 1934, p. 139. (Not unrelated to the passage of prohibition in Utah was Grant's strengthening of the Church's own requirements that its members abstain from alcohol.) David O. McKay, a Republican who became president of the church in 1951, was able to establish friendly relationships with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. McKay supported church apostle Ezra Taft Benson in his role as Eisenhower's Secretary of Agriculture. President Lyndon B. Johnson invited McKay to visit him in the White House. (Benson was president of the church from 1985 to 1994.) McKay rarely used his position in the church to speak out on political issues. One instance in which he did was to instruct Mormon congressmen that they should support the right-to-work legislation that was before congress at the time. Some of the congressmen reacted negatively to McKay's message feeling like it was not the place of their religious leader to tell them how to vote. McKay considered this a religious issue and not a strictly political decision and in fact apostle Joseph F. Merrill had spoken on this very issue during his address at the Church's General Conference. During the 1968 election, George W. Romney became the first Latter-day Saint to stage a credible run for the presidency.Haws, The Mormon Image in the American Mind, p. 12. By this time, he was well known as a member of the LDS Church and perhaps the most nationally visible one since Brigham Young.Haws, The Mormon Image in the American Mind, pp. 13, 17. But his membership in the LDS Church was scarcely mentioned at all during the campaign.White, The Making of the President, 1968, p. 134. Romney did not receive the nomination but after the election Nixon appointed him to his cabinet as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. During the administration of Spencer W. Kimball, the church spoke out in opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. In the 1990s, the LDS Church participated in an effort to prevent the passage of gay marriage legislation in Hawaii. 21st century In 2004, church president Gordon B. Hinckley was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush. In 2008, the church was involved in promoting California Proposition 8, which amended the California constitution to prohibit same-sex marriages. When Mitt Romney, son of former presidential candidate George Romney, campaigned for President of the United States in 2012 as the Republican Party nominee, it was the first year that a member of the LDS Church received the nomination from one of the two major American political parties. At the time, the U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, was also a member of the LDS Church. And shortly thereafter, the President Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate, Orrin Hatch, was also a member of the church. A 2012 Pew Center survey on Religion and Public Life indicates that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members have stated that they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences. In recent decades since the 1968 presidential election, the Republican Party has consistently won a majority of the LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, is also one of the most heavily Republican states in the country. In response to the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Church issued a statement of concern over racism, intolerance, and hatred‚Äî calling for peace and understanding, and for treating \\"one another with greater kindness, compassion and goodness.\\" See also * Mormonism and polygamy * Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints * Women's suffrage in Utah Notes External links * Political Neutrality from MormonNewsroom.org Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Politics in the United States Category:Mormonism and politics ","title":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and politics in the United States"},{"id":"50553704","text":"Dorcadion acutispinum is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The video game is based on the 1993 film of the same name, and includes elements from Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, which the film is based upon. Plot Set after the events of the film, a group of scientists is sent to collect dinosaur eggs at InGen's Jurassic Park, a theme park that is populated with genetically engineered dinosaurs and is located on the fictional island of Isla Nublar. After the group's helicopter crashes on the island, a survivor ‚Äì controlled by the player ‚Äì receives a video message from Emily Shimura, a computer expert. Shimura states that the crash was the result of sabotage orchestrated by InGen's corporate rival, Biosyn Corporation, which paid to have a bomb attached to the helicopter. A second helicopter is sent to rescue the player, but it is also compromised by Biosyn, which has sent out its own team to steal the dinosaur eggs. When Biosyn's helicopter arrives, the company's agents are tranquilized by the player, who uses the helicopter to escape the island. Gameplay Jurassic Park is a point-and-click adventure game, with a strong emphasis on action sequences which require split-second timing. The player must search Isla Nublar to retrieve eggs from seven different dinosaur species and place them in an incubator at the Jurassic Park visitor center. The eggs must be collected within a real-time 12-hour limit. Jurassic Park is played from a first-person perspective, giving the player a panoramic view of the surroundings as well as various tools to interact with, and a trio of weapons to contend with dinosaurs. Because none of the weapons (a stun gun, tranquilizer darts, and gas grenades) are lethal, each situation is in the form of a puzzle disguised as combat which requires more than just shooting to survive. First-aid kits can be used to replenish the player's health, while night vision goggles allow the player to see in dark environments. Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker makes video appearances throughout the game to provide the player with hints and dinosaur information, via special Dinosaur Field Kiosks that are located near dinosaur paddocks. Shimura also provides the player with information through video messages. Development and release In January 1992, Sega spent an estimated $1 million to purchase the rights to develop a Jurassic Park video game. Sega had the rights to use the Jurassic Park logo and some sounds from the film, but none of the characters. Elements from Michael Crichton's novel, Jurassic Park, were added into the game. It was the first Sega CD video game to be developed exclusively in the United States by Sega of America. Initially, the game was to include three different perspectives: top-down, side-scrolling, and first-person. Development began on prototype versions of each perspective. The game's designers later realized that the game was too big, and decided to concentrate on only one perspective instead. The designers chose the first-person perspective which was the most complete prototype out of the three at that point in development. The designers scrapped the previous game design and re- began development to redesign everything. The designers felt the game would work better as a first-person point-and-click game. While point-and-click games were popular on PCs at the time, they were less common on home video game consoles. Full motion video (FMV) sequences were created for the game using Cinepak. The game's backgrounds are based on actual video footage of geographical locations. Sega sent several teams to various locations to film the footage, including Georgia and a swampland in Alabama. The development team started with 30 hours of footage and scanned portions of it into Macintosh computers, allowing the team to use the geographical textures and colors in the game. Background sketches were created by artist Mimi Doggett, and were then converted into pixels and sprites. In addition to appearing in the game, Bakker also provided information to the developers on how the game's dinosaurs should move and behave. Bakker shot his video segments in a studio against a white background. Afterwards, the footage had to be compressed to be playable on the Sega CD. The dinosaurs were created using Silicon Graphics computers, which had also been used to create the creatures in the film. The development team originally intended to use rotoscoping before realizing how much quicker it would be to use Silicon Graphics computers. The dinosaur designs and other aspects of the game had to adhere to the Sega CD's limited 16-color palette. In addition to dinosaur sketches, models were also created for the animals to aid artists in creating dinosaur sprites on the Silicon Graphics computers. Birds were also studied to determine the dinosaur movements. For example, still frames of ostriches were referenced for the game's Tyrannosaurus. Scot Bayless was the game's producer. Spencer Nilsen composed the game's soundtrack. Sound designer Brian Coburn, along with a recording team, traveled to Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp to create audio recordings of angry alligators. According to Coburn, \\"We tracked down and cornered alligators in the swamp to try to get them angry so that they would hiss. We were cocky and deliberately aggravated the alligators to get a more dramatic response.\\" Coburn and the recording team were nearly attacked by an alligator during the process. The alligator sounds were used for the game's Tyrannosaurus roar, while bird sounds were used for other dinosaurs. Jurassic Park was one of the few Sega CD games to utilize the system's QSound feature. In January 1993, a demo of the game was shown at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. As of July 1993, the game's U.S. release was scheduled for fall 1993. Ultimately, the game was released in the U.S. during the first quarter of 1994, followed by a U.K. release in April 1994. Reception Joel Easley of Scripps Howard News Service considered it the best Jurassic Park game released up to that point, and one of the best games available for the Sega CD. Easley praised the music and sound effects for their use of QSound, and also praised the graphics, but said about the game's save feature: \\"The bad thing is it takes up a lot of space.\\" Roy Bassave of Knight-Ridder News Service considered the SNES version of Jurassic Park to be superior, and criticized the Sega CD version for the slow loading times needed to generate each new area of the game that the player explores. GamePro praised the sound effects but criticized the graphics: \\"Although this is a CD game, which implies that it will showcase powerful graphics capabilities, you won't see any particularly fascinating images jumping off the screen at you.\\" GamePro noted the game's excessive amount of searching required by the player, writing that while \\"this doesn't distract from the fun, it certainly slows down the action.\\" GamePro wrote that the Sega CD version was \\"definitely the most educational and entertaining\\" video game adaptation of Jurassic Park, calling it \\"as much a classroom tool as an enjoyable game,\\" although the magazine noted that younger players \\"may be bored by its detailed gameplay.\\" Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game a \\"C\\" rating and wrote that it \\"moves at too leisurely a pace to satisfy action fans, though it has some admirable features, such as scholarly dissertations on various breeds of dinosaur.\\" Shawn Sackenheim of AllGame gave Jurassic Park four stars out of five. Sackenheim wrote that the game's graphics suffered from the system's limited color palette, which made \\"everything dark and dithered, though it, somewhat, adds to the mood of the game.\\" Sackenheim also praised the game for, \\"A well rounded soundtrack and immersive sound effects.\\" Mean Machines, a U.K. magazine, gave the game a rating of 73 out of 100 and praised its FMV sequences, but also wrote, \\"Lack of excitement is the factor that brings down Jurassic CD's lastability. Jurassic CD doesn't deliver the elements of the film you really want.\\" In November 1994, U.K. magazine Mega placed the game at number 9 in their Top Mega CD Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, Maverick Magazines, November 1994 At the time of the game's release, the character of Emily Shimura was noted as being one of the few female characters in video games to have a role that was favorably associated with computer technology.

The flow sequence is from Upper Jo-Mary Lake into Middle Jo-Mary Lake and then through Lower Jo-Mary Lake into Pemadumcook Lake. Upper Jo- Mary Lake The upper lake has approximately the same surface area as the lower lake, but holds a larger volume of water. Johnston Brook drains Johnston Pond and Jo-Mary Pond into the west side of the lake; and Duck Brook drains Duck Pond into the north end of the lake. Upper Jo-Mary Stream drains from the eastern side of the upper lake into Turkey Tail Lake to the northeast. The upper lake has a native population of lake trout, and has been stocked with brook trout and land-locked Atlantic salmon. Rainbow smelt and white perch have been introduced to the lake. Middle Jo-Mary Lake The middle lake is the smallest of the three, although connected with Turkey Tail Lake to the southeast at the same level through two narrow necks on either side of a large island. Upper Jo-Mary Stream flows from the upper lake into Turkey Tail Lake. The northern end of the middle lake flows through a narrow neck into the southeastern corner of the lower lake at the same level. The shallow water of the middle lake becomes too warm for trout during the summer months, but the lake supports a population of chain pickerel and white perch. Lower Jo-Mary Lake In addition to drainage from the upper and middle lakes to the south, the lower lake receives drainage from the west through the Cooper Brook Deadwater. Leavitt Pond, Henderson Pond, and Mud Pond drain to the deadwater through Mud Brook; while Rocky Pond, Crawford Pond, Church Pond, and Cooper Pond drain through Cooper Brook. The Appalachian Trail follows Cooper Brook from Crawford Pond to the deadwater and thence follows the shoreline along the western end of the lower lake. The northeast corner of the lower lake overflows into the south side of Pemadumcook Lake only a few hundred yards (or metres) to the north. Native populations of lake trout, brook trout, and land- locked Atlantic salmon receive comparatively light angling pressure because there is no motor vehicle road to the lower lake.

The company provides a number of products and services to academic researchers and pharmaceutical industries, including research- and GMP-grade custom peptides. History Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, CPC Scientific was founded in 2001 by Dr. Shawn Lee, Ph.D. Product lines initially included research- grade custom peptides, catalog peptides, and Fmoc-protected amino acids. In 2006, CPC Scientific opened a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) facility in Hangzhou, China and began producing GMP-grade peptides for use in clinical applications. By 2011, the GMP facility was inspected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the company began supplying pharmaceutical-grade peptides to companies in the United States. On March 17, 2016, CPC Scientific passed a 4th U.S. FDA inspection. Manufacturing CPC Scientific manufactures most of their products by way of solid-phase peptide synthesis, a process originally described by Robert Bruce Merrifield in 1963. Solid-phase synthesis routes enable manufacturing of relatively long peptide sequences by avoiding isolation and purification of synthetic intermediates. This iterative process allows for the preparation of more complex peptides for use as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), novel drug therapeutics, and general research applications. CPC Scientific has published some research articles that describe peptide synthesis methodologies, including a technique called hydrocarbon stapling. Stapled peptides contain a synthetic modification that involves olefin metathesis to stabilize alpha-helix and beta-sheet secondary structures. Products manufactured by CPC Scientific have also been cited in scientific journals.

He was described by Geoffrey Dutton as \\"Australia's first modern poet\\" and Kenneth Slessor included him in \\"the front rank of Australian poets\\". His work was the subject of one of Douglas Stewart's 1977 Boyer Lectures for the ABC.Ronald McCuaig Selected Poems, Angus & Robertson 1992 Most of his poems were first published in The Bulletin, which he joined as a member of staff in 1949, becoming short story editor from 1950 to 1960.Writers of The Bulletin, Douglas Stewart, 1977 Boyer Lectures, Australian Broadcasting Commission 1977 In Norway he is well known for his children's book Fresi Fantastika, translated into Norwegian in 1975, originally published as Gangles in English in 1972. Personal life McCuaig's parents lived at Mayfield, on the rural fringe of Newcastle. In 1915, when McCuaig was seven BHP established an iron and steel works at the nearby suburb of Port Waratah. His mother died the same year. BHP's iron and steel works are depicted in Berceuse de Newcastle, the poem which opens McCuaig's Selected Poems (1992): It's always sunset in the east With a roddle- toddle-toddle, When the night furnace is in blast With a roddle-toddle-toddle And all night long the rolling-mill Goes roddle-toddle-toddle McCuaig recalled in an interview with Peter Kirkpatrick he had taken elocution lessons in Newcastle from a woman called Beatrice Welch. At the time he would stand on the back fence and shout his poetry lessons in the direction of their neighbours. Ronald's father worked in a warehouse as an ironmonger. After the death of his wife he brought up Ronald on his own. He was a quiet man with a love of Banjo Paterson, and passed his interests on to his son. When he was eleven Ronald spent ten days on a relative's farm remembered in ten poems which make up Holiday Farm, a sequence he wrote in 1953 and first published in book form eight years later in The Ballad of Bloodthirsty Bessie and Other Poems. On Fridays after school Ronald visited his father in his office. At the end of the working day, when the warehouse closed, father and son went to a cafe for a meal then to a show, or to the School of Arts in Hunter Street, where they sat on the upstairs veranda and took in the scene: A cake-shop glowed across the way With a rainbow cake display; I never saw its keeper there, And never saw a customer, And yet there was activity High in the south- western sky: A bottle flashing on a sign Advertising someone's wine. McCuaig got a job at Sargood Brothers Department Store working as a \\"glorified office boy\\". One day a school friend who had gone into accountancy told him there was a place opening for somebody to write the 2BL \\"Topical Chorus\\" a nightly piece of verse on something in the news. McCuaig got the job. Career Ronald McCuaig began writing for radio in 1927, hired by 2BL as a writer, his principal task being to write a piece of light verse for the evening program. He worked for Wireless Weekly throughout the following decade. During World War II he worked for the ABC and for Smith's Weekly. After the War he wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald. Peter Kirkpatrick in \\"Thus Quod McCuaig\\" in Southerly 1991 recounts \\"McCuaig's earliest collection of verse, Vaudeville, was written in an astonishing two months at the end of 1933. The sexual candour of many of these poems of urban life meant they were unacceptable to the conservative literary journals and presses, so after four years of trying to find a publisher the author decided to publish them himself. Seven printers refused to touch the job, though, fearing prosecution.\\" The book finally appeared in 1938.Kirkpatrick, Peter. Thus Quod McCuaig: An interview with Ronald McCuaig. Southerly, Vol. 51, No. 2, June 1991: 267-282 Ronald McCuaig (left) with Kenneth Slessor. Kenneth Slessor, writing for Smith's Weekly, called Vaudeville \\"the most remarkable book of Australian poetry published this year.\\" Douglas Stewart described McCuaig's work as both astonishing and outrageous. Peter Kirkpatrick described McCuaig as \\"one of Australia's finest lyric poets.\\" McCuaig's published poetry includes Vaudeville (1938), which contains the best of his modernist work, The Wanton Goldfish (1941), and the collections Quod Ronald McCuaig (1946), The Ballad of Bloodthirsty Bessie (1961) and Selected Poems (1992) which contained his later works previously published as Scenes from Childhood and Holiday Farm. His poems were widely anthologised. He also wrote short stories and essays (Tales Out of Bed, 1944) and Australia and the Arts (1972), as well as two children's books Gangles (1972) and Tobolino and the amazing football boots (1974). Fresi fantastika (1975) was a Norwegian version of Gangles. Some of his poems were set to music by George Dreyfus (Music in the Air). Despite the success of The Ballad of Bloodthirsty Bessie in 1961, McCuaig published no more volumes or collections until Kirkpatrick's compilation of poems spanning his entire career Selected Poems (1992) Angus & Robertson. This mainstream publication established McCuaig as a highly original and versatile poet, modernist in the observational style, and a superb technician, master of 17th century conceits and madrigals. His lighter verse was colloquial and satirical. The poems in Vaudeville were written in a two-month period between the end of November 1933 and January 1934, written at night because McCuaig's day job was working as a journalist on The Wireless Weekly. Publishers considered the poems unacceptably explicit and even when McCuaig decided to pay for the printing himself seven printing firms refused to print the book because of the subject matter. McCuaig decided in 1938 to publish Vaudeville himself, printing the book on a hand-press in his flat at Pott's Point. Thirteen out of the total twenty poems are portraits of individual women, the others focus on either a man being in love with a woman or the dilemma he faces through involvement with a woman. Interwoven is the theme of these women's quiet lives of desperation. McCuaig's women endured rape, old age, loneliness, prostitution and adultery, themes aligned with the modernist preoccupation with isolation. In a contemporary review of Vaudeville Adam Mckay wrote: \\"In an ironic and (yes) in a ribaid manner, Ronald McCuaig states something of his own vision of life. Like Kenneth Mackenzie he too is a Sydney journalist whose ephemeral work has brilliant comedy and satire; but unlike Mr Mackenzie he undertakes no naked flight back to Earth; his poetry dwells in flats, rides on tram-cars goes to picture-shows, in a mixture of kisses and derision. Mr McCuaig is unconventional and indecorous, and a long way from being respectable; but I have high esteem of the value of ribaldry in literature.\\" McCuaig's second book of poems, The Wanton Goldfish, (1941) contained poems written earlier than those in Vaudeville, before he was influenced by Leavis, T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and concentrated on poetic forms including the Elizabethan song; the triolet, and the sestina, the most difficult of fixed poetical forms. Like Vaudeville, The Wanton Goldfish was printed on his private press. He had come to like printing his own books. The edition was of 170 copies on bond paper, 13 on hand-made paper, and another 30 on hand-made paper with three additional drawings. Towards the end of World War II came a successful book Tales out of Bed (1944). Douglas Stewart noted sales of thousands of copies were due in part to the Americans in Australia at the time buying up just about all the books in Sydney and clamouring for more. The first story The Fairy in the Suitcase, features a fairy skipping naked out of its suitcase producing any number of bottles of beer her lucky owner cares to ask for. Also included was McCuaig's appreciation of Kenneth Slessor's poetry, the first extensive essay on Slessor ever to be published. Tales out of Bed also included essays on T.S. Eliot and the poetry of Leon Gellert. In 1949, McCuaig joined the editorial staff of The Bulletin, becoming short story editor from 1950 to 1960. As 'Swilliam' he contributed many articles of literary criticism, theatre reviews and topical verse. In 1992 McCuaig was awarded a New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards Special Award for his contribution to Australian Literature. The award was instigated by board member Geoffrey Dutton with support from Elizabeth Riddell and Barry Humphries in an attempt to gain recognition for McCuaig. Modernism In Geoffrey Dutton named Ronald McCuaig \\"Australia's First Modernist Poet\\". He explained what he meant by modernism and McCuiag's part in it in a 1999 interview with Susan Hill in the Animist, January 1999 where he said Kenneth Slessor was usually considered to be the first Australian modernist poet but that McCauig was slightly ahead of him. This was because Slessor was held back by the influence of Norman Lindsay who was a romanticist in an Australian group of writers and artists practising what Dutton called \\"fossilised 19th century diction\\" which had \\"no relation to the present day world\\". Dutton went on to explain T.S. Eliot had published The Wasteland in 1922 but was largely unknown or considered irrelevant in Australia in the 1920s. Slessor and McCuaig were both followers of French modernism but more so with McCuaig who was not (unlike Slessor) under the \\"powerful influence of Norman Lindsay\\". Neither Hill nor Dutton had been able to find any Australian influence on Mccuaig, who was the first to break with the rural Georgian tradition and write directly about the modern world in an observational style. Yet McCuaig was barely known as a modern poet in his lifetime. This was the result, Geoffrey Dutton and Douglas Stewart believed, of McCuaig's shyness (to the point of social anxiety) and his lack of self- promotion. He was never \\"taken up by anyone\\" Dutton said. According to Dutton, Slessor, who became well known as a modernist poet, knews and admired McCuaig, loved his expression and thought he was a marvellous technician. McCuaig himself acknowledged his influences, having read Leavis New Bearings in English Poetry, Eliot, Henry James, and Ezra Pound which he bought as first editions. One aspect of McCuaig's modernism noted by Hill and Dutton was the rather explicit nature of his love poems, especially in Vaudeville written in 1933, at a time when writing about women, sex, and love between men and women was virtually unknown in Australia. Even more unusual was the strong feminist response characterized by McCauig's work. Hill said the feminist perspective in The Letter', a poem about rape, was unique for the era. The Letter employs a savage, satirical tone to attack misogyny: The opposite flat is dark and dumb, Yet I feel certain he will come Home to his love as drunk as ever And, in a slowly rising fever, Noting the whisky bottle gone, Will trip and curse and stumble on Into the bathroom, pull the chain, Fumble the cabinet, curse again; Will ask the slut where she has hid His toothbrush; blunder back to bed, Find his pyjamas tied in knots And give her, as he puts it, what's Coming to her. She won't escape Her deeply meditated rape. Literary criticism Ronald McCuaig produced a number of commentaries on Australian literature in the form of articles (especially for the Bulletin's Red Page), essays, and booklets, notably Literature a survey of Australian writing from 1810 to 1965. He was the first to produce an in depth review of Kenneth Slessor in The Bulletin in August 1939 and republished in \\"Tales out of bed\\" (1944) The review was favourable, ranking Slessor above C.J. Brennan and W.B. Yeats. It was written a year before \\"Five Bells\\" which marked Slessor's move to modernism, a move inspired, according to Rundle and others, by McCuaig. The review therefore covers the pre-modernist parts of Slessor's poetry. In 1954 McCuaig was the editor of an anthology Australian Poetry published by Angus and Robertson greeted upon its arrival by William T. Fleming in Meanjin as \\"frankly depressing\\". Fleming finds, in comparison with overseas anthologies, the collection guilty of unimaginative use of rhyme, crude prosody, heavy- handed abstraction and fashionable obscurity. He finds the ballads entirely without poetic merit and blames The Bulletin (where McCuaig worked) for their inclusion.Fleming, William. Australian Poetry 1954; The World's Flesh; Far- Back Country Meanjin, Vol. 14, No. 2, Winter 1955: 271-273 . Helen Heney on the other hand in her Southerly review of Australian Poetry 1954 doesn't find the need to compare Australian poetry with overseas models and admires the wry, dry, slightly harsh Australian aroma. She rates most highly Judith Wright's \\"Request to a Year\\" while finding some other offerings including the poem \\"Tower View, Maitland\\", \\"unprecise and mentally formless\\".Hene, Helen Australian Poetry, 1954. Edited by Ronald McCuaig. (Angus and Robertson, 1954) reviewed by Helen Heney Southerly 1955 Vol 6 No. 3 In contrast to his rather savage treatment by some in the academic poetry establishment McCuaig was a rather even-handed and positive critic, not easily displeased and only occasionally disappointed. In his review of Australian Poetry, 1951-1952 selected by Kenneth Mackenzie (Angus and Robertson, 1952) he takes pleasure in the efforts of Rosemary Dobson, David Campbell, Hal Porter, Elizabeth Riddell, Douglas Stewart, Vivian Smith, Peter Hopeghood and Nancy Keesing; is ambivalent about Ray Mathew and Roland Robinson; and is only mildly critical of Rex Ingamells and Ian Mudie. Critical reception Despite recognition by his peers around the time of Vaudeville and later by Geoffrey Dutton, Kenneth Slessor, Douglas Stewart and Peter Kirkpatrick McCuaig's reputation in Australian literature has been mixed. When the collection QUOD Ronald McCuaig appeared in 1946 his Vaudeville era modernism was viewed as \\"satisfying poetry\\" but perhaps trivial by R T Dunlop in Southerly.Dunlop, RT. Vose and prerse. Southerly, Vol. 9, No. 3, Sept 1948: 184-186. . Academic establishment critics were sometimes scathing. New Zealand born A. D. Moody, while senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne 1958-1964DEBRETT'S in his 1961 Poetry Chronicle included McCuaig among the \\"anti-poetry versifiers who seem bent, whether out of ignorance or indifference or contempt, upon debasing their medium\\". He singled out McCuaig in particular in saying his \\"tone and attitudes are fairly consistently man-to-man-over-the-beer-keg\\".Moody, AD. Poetry Chronicle Meanjin Quarterly, Vol. 20, No. 4, 1961: 492-508. . In 2010 essayist Guy Rundle remarked McCuaig's greatest contribution to Australian poetry \\"may well be that he encouraged his friend and fellow journalist-poet Kenneth Slessor to a more ambitious aesthetic, thus helping him to bust out of his late Georgianism and into the full modernity of 'Five Bells\\". Rundle's assessment was that McCuaig could hit a \\"cool and stylish note in his verse, although much of it dips too far into the twee and whimsical for contemporary tastes\\". Laurence Bourke in Southerly (1992) rates McCuaig's body of work as represented by Selected Poems (1992) more highly than Rundle (who was anyway using him more as an example of creative drive unnassisted by the state or the status quo and not critiquing him as such). Bourke echoes Geoffrey Dutton's call for McCuaig's repatriation as an important literary figure but disputes the label \\"modernist\\". He argued to call Vaudeville \\"modernist\\" distorts \\"either the literary term or the poems\\". He prefers the term \\"modern\\", a term he notes Dutton used. Burke also considers the ballads and songs of childhood written from 1953 to 1959 the highlight of the collection, and argues these are \\"not modernist in any useful sense of the term.\\" Elkin in Poems from Literature and from Life, in Southerly, reviewing The Ballad of Bloodthirsty Bessie, and Other Poems takes the complete opposite view to Moody, arguing it is in the boisterous tales and ballads McCuaig is fully himself, especially \\"Mokie's Madrigal\\", and \\"The Ballad of Bloodthirsty Bessie\\" which he regards as \\"altogether delightful ‚Äî fantastic but not strained, consistent, full of life, and quite un-literary ... the rollicking tale of a country virgin who kills her lovers ‚Äî sailors lured inland to work on the farm by Bessie's shrewd old father ‚Äî in order to save them from the sin of sexual indulgence.\\"Poems from Literature and from Life, Southerly vol. 22 no. 1 1962 periodical issue pg. 53-55 review of The Ballad of Bloodthirsty Bessie, and Other Poems, by Ronald McCuaig Alan Gould in his contemporary 1992 review of McCaug's Selected Poems (1992) dismisses the light verse, praises a lightness of touch in The Wanton Goldfish and judges McCuaig's best work to be not his modernist poems of sexual candour but his poems of charmed innocence in works such as Au Tombeau de Mon Pere.Gould, Alan.

Biography =Early life= Holmberg was born in Helsinki. His father was Olof Henrik Holmberg (1799‚Äì1863) and mother Josefina Gustava Federley (1806‚Äì1840). His mother passed away from a lung disease and Olof raised his six surviving children with the help of his sisters. Werner was interested in painting from a young age, taking private lessons from and later Magnus von Wright. He also learned oil painting from Johan Erik Lindh. In 1848 he became a student at the just-formed Academy of Fine Arts. However his father Olof wanted his son to study law, so in his first year of university studies he also worked part-time at the National Board of Customs. At the university he learned painting from Berndt Godenhjelm and von Wright again. In 1850 he helped Robert Wilhelm Ekman paint frescoes in the Turku cathedral. In 1853 he finished his studies. =Study at D√ºsseldorf= In July 1853 he moved to D√ºsseldorf as the first Finnish art student, after many Norwegian and Swedish art students had already gone there to study. He studied there under Hans Gude. Erik Bodom was also recruited to help him with his work. Nordic topics were popular in Germany, and he first focused on them with works such as The Kyr√∂ Rapids. His breakthrough was in 1856 with Autumn Morning, and with the new-found fame he was able to quickly sell all of his paintings. By this point Gude recognized Holmberg as fully trained and ended his tutorship, although they still kept close contact. As he ran out sketches of Finland, he began painting German landscapes. =After the study at D√ºsseldorf= In 1857, after four years of being away, he returned to Finland, spending time with relatives. In the summer of 1858 he spent time in Norway and married Norwegian Anna Glad (1834‚Äì1909), a painter and daughter of the commander of Akershus Fortress, Christian Glad. Gude also spent some time with Holmberg in Norway, painting watercolor sketches together near Christiania. Holmberg had settled to live in D√ºsseldorf where he spent the winter with Anna. They visited Finland in the summer of 1859 and spent time in Kuru. =Death= But by early 1860 he was having considerable difficulties with his lungs, relating to tuberculosis that he had already struggled with for years. In the spring they had a daughter, Betzy (who later became a composer) but the couple also ran into some financial troubles as they had a harder time selling paintings. The situation looked brighter again when he was invited to be a professor of landscape art in a new art school in Weimar. However, the invitation was cancelled and Werner was now bedridden with his sickness. As he died in September, many of his paintings were left unfinished. One of his sisters and an older brother had also died from the same sickness. Legacy Holmberg is the first Finnish painter to have received international recognition. His effect especially to Finnish landscape painting was large.

Documentary During the establishment of the movement, a documentary was made by the BBC along with it. This documentary, narrated by Heydon Prowse is called \\"The Town that went Offshore\\" or \\"The Town That Took on the Taxman\\" and was first shown in January 2016. The movie follows the business owners as they decide to establish an untaxed Manx company which designs and owns a brand (Crickhowell Fair Tax), use the brand in their advertising and pay royalties for using this brand, as big companies do with their own brands. Their Manx company sets up a Dutch subsidiary which receives the royalties and sends them to the Isle of Man, since Britain would tax royalties sent directly to a tax haven, but charges no tax on royalty payments to the Netherlands, and the Netherlands charges no tax on royalties sent to tax havens. Thus their money accumulates tax-free in the Isle of Man, and the movie suggests ways to use it for expenses in Wales, such as borrowing it. The movie also discusses customer relationship managers which tax authorities assign to big businesses to ensure their tax arrangements are valid.
